'''Giovanni Villani''' (c. 1276 or 1280&ndash;1348)<ref name="bartlett 35">Bartlett, 35.</ref><ref name="encyclopedia 1517"/> was a [[Florence|Florentine]]-[[Italy|Italian]] banker, official, diplomat, and [[Chronicle|chronicler]] who wrote the ''[[Nuova Cronica]]'' (''New Chronicles'') on the [[History of Florence|history of Florence]]. He was a leading statesman of Florence but later gained an unsavory reputation and served time in prison due to the bankruptcy of a trading and [[History of banking|banking]] company he worked for. His interest and elaboration in economic details, [[statistics|statistical]] information, and political and psychological insight signifies him as a more modern late medieval chronicler of Europe.<ref name="bartlett 35 36">Bartlett, 35&ndash;36.</ref> However, historian [[Kenneth R. Bartlett]] notes that "his reliance on such elements as [[Divine Providence]] links Villani closely with the medieval vernacular chronical tradition," that is to say, not linked closely with his [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance-era successors]].<ref name="bartlett 36">Bartlett, 36.</ref> In recurring themes made implicit through significant events described in his ''Cronica'', Villani also emphasized three assumptions about sin and morality that guided historical events, these being that excess brings disaster, forces of right and wrong are at constant struggle, and that events are directly related to the will of [[God]].

Villani was inspired to write his ''Cronica'' after attending the [[Jubilee (Christian)|jubilee]] celebration in [[Rome]] in 1300 and noting the venerable history of that city. He outlined the events in his ''Cronica'' year for year, following a strictly linear narrative format. He provided intricate details on many important historical events, such as construction projects, floods, fires, famines, and plagues of the city of Florence and the wider region of [[Tuscany]].<ref>Bartlett, 36&ndash;40.</ref><ref name="kleinhenz 1102">Kleinhenz, 1102.</ref><ref name="benedictow 286">Benedictow, 286.</ref>

While continuing work on the ''Cronica'' and detailing the enormous loss of life during the [[Black Death]] in 1348, Villani died of the very same illness.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> His work on the ''Cronica'' was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani's work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The criticism is mostly aimed at his emphasis of the [[supernatural]] in guiding events, his organizational style, as well as his glorification of the [[papacy]] and Florence.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Giotto di Bondone 051.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A painting by [[Giotto di Bondone]] (c. 1267&ndash;1337) in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]], within the chapel owned by the [[Peruzzi]] bankers]]
Giovanni Villani was born into the Florentine merchant middle class. He was the son of Villano di Stoldi di Bellincione, who came from an old and well-respected ''arti maggiori'' family of merchants.<ref>Kleinhenz, 1147.</ref><ref name="baron 443"/> Villani was a member of the ''Calimala'' (wool finishers) [[guild]] in Florence since the year 1300, serving on the ''mercanzia'' council of eight.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> During that year he visited [[Rome]] during the jubilee celebration.  After observing the well-known ancient monuments of Rome and acknowledging its renowned historical personages, he was inspired to write the ''Cronica'', a [[universal history]] of Florence in a strictly linear, year-by-year format.<ref name="bartlett 36"/> During the early years of the 14th century, he gained political perspective by travelling throughout [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[France]] and [[Flanders]] for the [[Peruzzi]] bank, of which he was a shareholder from 1300 to 1308.<ref>"Villani, Giovanni." (2008). [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075372 In Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]. Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online. Retrieved on [[2008]]-[[01-14]].</ref><ref name="kleinhenz 1144">Kleinhenz, 1144.</ref>  Traveling abroad as a [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for the company, Villani was paid a regular salary in addition to his shareholding profits.<ref name="de roover 33">De Roover, 33.</ref> On [[May 15]], [[1306]], one of the first exchange contracts (''cambium'') to mention the city of [[Bruges]] involved two parties: Giovanni Villani, representing the Peruzzi Company, granting a loan to Tommaso Fini, representing the Gallerani Company of [[Siena]].<ref>De Roover, 49.</ref> Villani and his brother Matteo transferred most of their economic activities to the Buonaccorsi firm by 1322. Giovanni Villani was a co-director of Buonaccorsi in 1324.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> The Buonaccorsi handled banking and commodity trade activities, spreading their influence throughout Italy, France, Flanders, England and several places in the Mediterranean.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/>

Villani returned to Florence in 1307 where he married and settled down for a life of city politics. He became one of the [[prior]]s of Florence in 1316 and 1317. At the same time, he participated in the crafty diplomatic tactics that resulted in peace with [[Pisa]] and [[Lucca]].<ref name="encyclopedia 1517"/> As head of the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] beginning in 1316, he collected its earlier records and created a register of all the coins struck in Florence.<ref name="encyclopedia 1517"/>  In 1321, he was again chosen prior, and in 1324 was deputed to inspect the rebuilding of the [[city wall]]s.<ref name="encyclopedia 1517">Vauchez ''et al''., 1517.</ref>  He went with the Florentine army to fight against [[Castruccio Castracani]], lord of Lucca, and was present at [[Altopascio]] during Florence's defeat. In his ''Cronica'', he gave a detailed account of why Florence was unable to acquire Lucca after the death of Castruccio Castracani.<ref name="kleinhenz 1145"/> 

A [[famine]] spread across Tuscany in 1328. From 1329 to 1330 Villani was a [[Medieval commune|commune]] appointed magistrate of provisioning protecting Florence from the famine's worst effects. In order to mitigate rising levels of starvation and assuage peasant discontent: grain was speedily imported from [[Sicily]] through [[Talamone]], {{nowrap|60,000 [[Italian coin florin|gold florins]]}} were taken from the city purse by the Florentine commune to aid the relief effort, and all the city's bakers had their ovens requisitioned by the government so that loaves of bread could be sold at affordable prices to the riotous and starving poor.<ref name="bartlett 39">Bartlett, 39.</ref> 

[[Image:PisanoDoors.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Villani was the superintendant of the construction of [[Andrea Pisano]]'s bronze doors for the [[Florence Baptistry]].]]
Villani was sent on another diplomatic mission in 1329, this time to [[Bologna]] to meet Cardinal Bertrand de Pouget.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> From 1330-1331 he superintended the making of [[Andrea Pisano]]'s bronze doors for the [[Florence Baptistry|Baptistry]].<ref name="encyclopedia 1517"/><ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/>  At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the ''Arte di Calimala'' and watched over the raising of the ''[[campanile]]'' of the [[Badia Fiorentina|Bad<U+00EC>a]].<ref>Toker, 158, footnote 10.</ref>  He was also sent with others as a hostage to [[Ferrara]], to ensure that Florence made good on a debt; there he remained for some months in 1331. 

Villani often expressed an optimistic viewpoint in his writing; this changed with the short-lived regime of [[Walter VI of Brienne]], a despot invited to Florence and granted ''[[signoria]]''.<ref name="kleinhenz 1146">Kleinhenz, 1146.</ref> In fact, after experiencing his own financial troubles, a terminated career, the failure of Florence in international affairs, and witnessing a host of different natural calamities and the onset of the Black Death in Europe, he became convinced that the [[apocalypse]] and final judgement was near.<ref name="green 168"/> The bankruptcy of the Buonaccorsi Company led to Villani's conviction and imprisonment in 1346, as he was a main partner.<ref name="caesar 147 148">Caesar, 147&ndash;148.</ref><ref>Wolfgang, 150.</ref> Other banking companies such as the [[Compagnia dei Bardi]] also went bankrupt at the same time. It is known that several events described in his ''Cronica'' surrounding the Buonaccorsi's bankruptcy were written to deliberately obscure the truth about the company's fraudulent behavior; Miller writes that "this is one of the most convincing conclusions" of historian Michele Luzzati's ''Giovanni Villani e la Compagnia dei Buonaccorsi'' (1971).<ref name="miller 109"/><ref>Miller ''et al''., 109, Footnote 10.</ref> 

[[Image:Calimala - Arti 029.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Coat of arms]] for the ''Arte di Calimala'', the [[guild]] to which Giovanni Villani belonged]]
Villani and the Buonaccorsi had gained an unsavory reputation as early as 1331, when Villani was tried (and cleared) for [[barratry]] for his part in building the new third circuit of walls around Florence.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> [[Charles, Duke of Calabria]] had granted the Buonaccorsi the right to tax three of the six districts of Florence, which did not help Villani's reputation amongst his fellow citizens.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> In early June 1342, partners and agents of the Buonaccorsi suddenly fled Florence, [[Avignon]], and [[Naples]], following bankruptcy proceedings by creditors, nearly all of whom had deposits in the Buonaccorsi bank.<ref name="miller 109">Miller ''et al''., 109.</ref> Like other Florentine bankers and companies having difficulty with bankruptcy at the time, in September 1342 they supported the move to invite Walter IV of Brienne to become the next ''[[Signoria of Florence|signor]]'' of Florence.  Walter later suspended all legal actions taken against the Buonaccorsi and other company partners for nearly a year.<ref name="miller 109"/> 

However, the legal case against the company was reopened and resumed in October 1343, after the violent overthrow of Walter VI.<ref name="miller 109"/>  It is unclear how long Villani served his prison sentence for alleged misconduct during the economic disaster of 1346. It is known that he was imprisoned in the ''Carceri delle Stinche''.<ref name="wolfgang 149 150">Wolfgang, 149&ndash;150.</ref> After the overthrow of the Brienne regime and a subsequent but short-lived aristocratic signoria, the ''novi cives'' or new families<U+2014>some even from the lesser guilds<U+2014>rose up in late September of 1343 and established a government that provided them with much greater representation in officialdom.<ref name="becker 1962 360">Becker (1962), 360.</ref> Villani and other chroniclers disdained these rustic non-aristocrats suddenly risen to power, considering them brazen upstarts incapable of governance.<ref name="becker 1962 360 361"/><ref name="baron 443">Baron, 443.</ref> Yet by the 1350s the general attitude towards the ''novi cives'' had changed much, as even Villani's brother Matteo depicted them in a heroic light for being united in a coalition with the merchants and artisans to curb [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] power.<ref name="becker 1962 360 361">Becker (1962), 360&ndash;361.</ref><ref name="baron 443 444">Baron, 443&ndash;444.</ref> Villani was also a staunch supporter of what he deemed the liberties of the Church, while criticizing the new popular government of the ''novi cives'' since they protested against the many legal exemptions the Church enjoyed.<ref name="becker 1959 64 65">Becker (1959), 64&ndash;65.</ref> However, he did find civic pride in that the whole city<U+2014>including the ''novi cives''<U+2014>had joined together in an uprising against Walter VI, whose sins of imposing tyranny were, to Villani, sufficient justification for the violence needed to overthrow him.<ref name="phillips 89">Phillips, 89.</ref>

==Nuova Cronica==
{{main|Nuova Cronica}}
[[Image:Battle of crecy froissart.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]] in 1346, from [[Froissart's Chronicles]]; Giovanni Villani wrote an accurate description of the battle and other events.<ref>DeVries, 162, 173, 175.</ref>]]
Villani's work is an [[Italian language|Italian]] chronicle written from the perspective of the political class of Florence just as the city rose to a rich and powerful life of thought and action.  Only scanty and partly legendary records had preceded his work, and there is little known of events before the death of [[Matilda of Tuscany|Countess Matilda]] in 1115.<ref name="wicksteed xxxi">Wicksteed, xxxi.</ref> The idea of writing the ''Cronica'' was suggested to Villani during the jubilee of Rome in 1300,<ref name="bartlett 35"/> under the following circumstances after [[Pope Boniface VIII]] made in honor of [[Nativity of Jesus|Christ's nativity]] a great indulgence; Villani writes: 

<blockquote>
And being on that blessed pilgrimage in the sacred city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as described by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history ... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in view of the fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.<ref name="bartlett 36"/>
</blockquote>

[[Image:Kieler Hansekogge 2007 vorne.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Villani wrote that the [[Cog (ship)|small cog type vessel]] with single mast, square sail, and stern-post [[rudder]] was introduced to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Venice|Venetians]] in 1304 by pirates from [[Bayonne]].<ref>Kleinhenz, 1031.</ref>]]
Thus, in 1300 or shortly after, Villani began working on the ''Cronica''. His ''Cronica'' was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, starting at conventionally [[Tower of Babel|Biblical times]] to 1264.<ref name="caesar 148">Caesar, 148.</ref> The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, all the way up to 1346.<ref name="caesar 148"/> He outlined the events in his ''Cronica'' in year to year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view.<ref name="kleinhenz 1145">Kleinhenz, 1145.</ref> He wrote his ''Cronica'' in the [[vernacular]] language rather than [[Latin]], the language of the educated elite.<ref name="green 161"/> His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation.<ref name="chisholm 903">Chisholm, 903.</ref> This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work,<ref name="chisholm 903"/> especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).<ref>Wicksteed, xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii.</ref>

Despite numerous mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's knowledge on many subjects, as a result of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents.<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted.<ref name="devries 162">DeVries, 162.</ref> While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his readers would have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.<ref name="phillips 89"/>

Villani is perhaps unequalled for the value of the statistical data he has preserved.<ref name="chisholm 903">Chisholm, 903.</ref> For example, he recorded that in Florence there were 80&nbsp;banks, 146&nbsp;bakeries, 80&nbsp;members in an association of city judges with 600&nbsp;notaries, 60&nbsp;physicians and surgical doctors, 100&nbsp;shops and dealers of spices, 8,000 to 10,000&nbsp;children attending primary school each year, 550 to 600&nbsp;students attending 4 different schools for [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] knowledge, 13,200&nbsp;[[bushel]]s of grain consumed weekly by the city, and 70,000 to 80,000&nbsp;pieces of cloth produced in the workshops of the ''[[Arte della Lana]]'' each year, the latter having a total value of {{nowrap|1,200,000 gold florins}}.<ref name="bartlett 41 42">Bartlett, 41&ndash;42.</ref><ref>Lopez ''et al''., 72.</ref> 

Villani was a [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]],<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> but his book is much more taken up with an inquiry into what is useful and true than with factional party considerations. In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored [[republicanism]] over [[monarchy]],<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> praising the philosopher [[Brunetto Latini]] (c. 1220&ndash;1294) as "the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science."<ref>Hyde, 122.</ref> However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like [[Robert of Naples]] were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrranical if it came to represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans).<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> Villani's ''Cronica'' also provide the first known biography of [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265&ndash;1321),<ref name="caesar xi">Caesar, xi.</ref><ref name="encyclopedia 1517"/> author of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved.<ref name="caesar 13 457">Caesar, 13, 457.</ref> When detailing the construction of the [[Florence Cathedral]] and the artist Giotto as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him "the most sovereign master of painting in his time."<ref name="bartlett 37">Bartlett, 37.</ref> 

[[Image:Philippe IV le Bel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 16th century depiction of [[Philip IV of France]], one of many victims of ill fate who Villani states fell from power and grace due to sin and immorality rather than fortune or circumstance]]
Historian Louis Green writes that the ''Cronica'' was written with three general assumptions about morality<ref name="green 163">Green, 163.</ref> which shaped the organization of the work, "[channeling] events into recurring patterns of significance."<ref name="green 163"/> These general assumptions were that excess brings disaster, that history is governed by a struggle between right and wrong, and that there is a direct connection between the events of the natural world and the overriding, supernatural and divine will of God who intercedes in these events.<ref name="green 163"/> For example, Villani described the story of Count Ugolini of [[Pisa]], who at the height of attaining his ill-gotten wealth and power was overthrown and eventually starved to death along with his sons.<ref name="green 163 164">Green, 163&ndash;164.</ref> Green writes that this story in the ''Cronica'' bears a resemblance to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Polycrates]] and his ring in the work of [[Herodotus]].<ref name="green 164">Green, 164.</ref> However, Green notes that Villani's "cautionary tales" disembarked from the Classical Greek tradition of the arrogant and haughty rich falling from fortune due to the Greek belief in equalizing forces determining one's unavoidable fate, which Green calls "excessive good fortune having to be balanced by an appropriate measure of sorrow."<ref name="green 164"/> Villani's adherence to Medieval [[Christianity]] allowed him to suggest retribution was delivered because of [[sin]] and insult to God.<ref name="green 164"/> He stressed that those who gained prestigious success would then come to engender pride; confident in one's position, pride would then lead one to sin, and sin would bring one into a stage of decline.<ref name="green 165">Green, 165.</ref> Villani wrote:

<blockquote>
...it seems that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so presently does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and so that no one should place his trust in fallacious good fortune.<ref name="green 164"/>
</blockquote>

[[Image:Giotto - Bonifatius VIII.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Pope Boniface VIII]], by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]
For Villani, this theory of sin and morality being tied directly with fate and fortune fit well with the ultimate fate of the [[Capetian dynasty]] of France.<ref name="green 165"/> The [[House of Capet]] was once the champion of the Church and ally of the papacy.<ref name="green 165"/> However, Villani correlated [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]'s defiance of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and seizure of the [[Knights Templar|Templar's]] wealth with later Capetian misfortunes, such as Philip's death in a hunting accident, the adultery of the wives of his three sons, the death of his heirs, and even French defeats in the Hundred Years' War.<ref name="green 165"/> Green points out that in Villani's writing there are two significant earthly powers that seem to be exempt or immune from this theory of immorality leading to downfall: Florence and the papacy.<ref name="green 165 166">Green, 165&ndash;166.</ref> The interests of these two powers represent, as Green states, "the kingpin of Villani's scheme of historical interpretation."<ref name="green 165 166"/>

Besides Divine Providence, Villani acknowledged other events that he believed were explainable via the supernatural. He wrote of many instances where holy men offered prophetic statements that later proved true, such as [[Pope Clement IV]]'s prophesy on the outcome for the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]].<ref name="green 166">Green, 166.</ref> He believed that certain events were really [[omen]]s of what was to come. For instance, when a lion was sent to Florence as a gift by Boniface VIII, a donkey purportedly killed the lion.<ref name="green 166"/> He interpreted this as an omen that foretold the Pope's beating and untimely death shortly after fighting Philip IV at [[Anagni]]; Villani wrote: "when the tamed beast kills the King of Beasts, then the dissolution of the Church will begin."<ref name="green 166"/> He also believed in [[astrology]] and changes in the heavens as indication of political changes, the deaths of rulers and popes, and natural calamities.<ref name="green 167">Green, 167.</ref> However, he noted that the movement of the heavens would not always predetermine the actions of men and did not trump the divine plan of God.<ref name="green 167"/>

==Death and continuation of Villani's work== 
[[Image:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|Map showing the spread of [[bubonic plague]] in Europe, a process Villani described in detail, noting that the death toll from the [[Black Death]] in Florence was not as great as other cities and regions he listed, such as Turkey, Pistoia, Prato, Bologna, Romagna, France, etc.<ref name="bartlett 38"/>]]
Villani wrote during the [[Bubonic plague]]: "The priest who confessed the sick and those who nursed them so generally caught the infection that the victims were abandoned and deprived confession, sacrament, medicine, and nursing. . .And many lands and cities were made desolate. And this plague lasted till ________"; Villani left the "_______" in order to record the time in which the plague was to end.<ref name="bartlett 38">Bartlett, 38.</ref><ref name="benedictow 69"/> Villani was unable to finish the line as he succumbed to the same plague.<ref name="bartlett 36 38">Bartlett, 36, 38.</ref><ref name="benedictow 69">Benedictow, 69.</ref>  He was buried in Florence in the Church of [[Santissima Annunziata]].<ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/>

Villani's ''Cronica'' was considered an important work at the time, valuable enough for his brother and nephew to continue it.<ref name="caesar 148"/><ref name="kleinhenz 1144"/> Nothing is known of Villani's brother, Matteo, save that he was twice married, that he died of the plague in 1363, and that he continued work on the ''Cronica'' until his death.<ref name="bartlett 36"/>  Wordier and less acute as a human observer, Matteo is well informed in his facts and is one of the most important sources of Italian history. [[Filippo Villani]], Matteo's son,<ref name="caesar 148"/> flourished in the latter half of the 14th century and ended the ''Cronica'' at 1364;<ref name="bartlett 36"/> his portion includes details of the lives of many Florentine artists and musicians, including [[Giotto di Bondone]] and [[Francesco Landini]]. The 15th century Florentine historian Domenico di Leonardo Buoninsegni also featured in the first two chapters of his ''Istoria Fiorentina'' a summary of Villani's ''Cronica''.<ref>Molho, 259.</ref>

By the 16th century, more than one edition of the ''Cronica'' was available in [[Printing|printed form]].<ref name="rudolph 66">Rudolph, 66.</ref> There was also an abundance of handwritten [[Manuscript|illuminated manuscripts]], including one from Venice by Bartholomeo Zanetti Casterzagense in 1537 and one from Florence by Lorenzo Torrentino in 1554.<ref name="rudolph 66"/>

==Legacy and criticism==
[[Image:Dante-alighieri.jpg|thumb|230px|right|This painting of [[Dante Alighieri]], painted by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], hangs in the chapel of the [[Bargello]] palace in Florence. The ''Cronica'' has aided modern scholars in further studies of Villani's various contemporaries such as Dante.]]
The ''Cronica'' of Villani is an incredibly rich historical record; its greatest value to modern historians are his descriptions of the people, data, and events experienced during his lifetime.<ref name="wicksteed xxxi">Wicksteed, xxxi.</ref> Historian Mark Phillips states that all subsequent Florentine accounts of the tyrannical regime of Walter VI of Brienne<U+2014>including those by [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]]<U+2014>were based upon the primary source of Villani's ''Cronica''.<ref name="phillips 89"/> Villani's written work on Dante Alighieri and the age in which he lived has provided insight into Dante's work, reasoning, and psyche.<ref name="wicksteed intro">Wicksteed, xxv&ndash;xlvi</ref> The reprinting of new editions of Villani's work in the early 20th century provided material for a resurgence in the study of Dante.<ref name="caesar 58 59">Caesar, 58&ndash;59.</ref> However, his descriptions of events which preceded him by centuries are riddled with inaccurate traditional accounts, popular legend, and hearsay.<ref name="wicksteed xxxi"/> In regards to his own time, he provides modern historians with valuable details on Florentine social and living habits, such as the growing trend and craze of wealthy Florentines in building large country homes far outside of the city.<ref name="goldthwaite 13 22">Goldthwaite, 13, 22.</ref> However, the early 20th century historian [[Philip Wicksteed]] stated of Villani, "When dealing with his own times, and with events immediately connected with Florence, he is a trustworthy witness, but minute accuracy is never his strong point; and in dealing with distant times and places he is hopelessly unreliable."<ref name="wicksteed xxxi"/> Louis Green also notes Villani's limitation as a chronicler and not a historian:

<blockquote>
Recording as he did incidents in the order of their occurrence without any of the historian's pretensions to a thematic organization of his material, he could not feed back the lessons of a changing present into a reinterpreted past. Nor did his devotion to the justification and glorification of Florence permit him to see in the altered fortunes of his city a repetition of the pattern of decline he had illustrated in the histories of the great dynasties of his age.<ref name="green 168">Green, 168.</ref>
</blockquote> 

Louis Green asserts that Giovanni's ''Cronica'' expressed the outlook of the merchant community in Florence at the time, but also provided valuable indications of "how that outlook was modified in a direction away from characteristically medieval to embryonically modern attitudes."<ref name="green 161">Green, 161.</ref> Green writes that Villani's ''Cronica'' was one of three types of chronicles found in the 14th century, the type which was largely a [[universal history]].<ref name="green 161"/> Other types would be chronicles of particular historic episodes such as [[Dino Compagni]]'s account of the White Guelphs and Black Guelphs or the more domestic chronicle that focused on the fortunes and events of one family, as written by Donato Velluti or Giovanni Morelli.<ref name="green 161 162">Green, 161&ndash;162.</ref>
