== Invention of Gatorade ==

Cade was a faculty member of the University of Florida College of Medicine when he was approached by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the [[Florida Gators football]] team, about the extreme [[dehydration]] faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and [[humidity]] of the [[Deep South]] in late summer and early fall.<ref name=mcleod8142005>Michael Mcleod, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-08-14/news/GATORADE14_1_gatorade-cade-shires  Gator-made]," ''Orlando Sentinel'' (August 14, 2005).  Retrieved February 17, 2010.</ref>  Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not [[urinate]] during practice and games.<ref name=mcleod8142005/>  Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing bodily fluids through [[perspiration]] and failing to replace fluid during practice and games.<ref name=mcleod8142005/>  Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to eighteen pounds during the three hours of a [[college football]] game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water.<ref name=ap11272007/>  A player's [[blood plasma|plasma]] volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.<ref name=ap11272007/>  During 1965 and 1966, Cade, together with his team of research doctors Dana Shires, James Free, and Alejandro M. de Quesada, conducted a series of trial-and-error experiments with his [[glucose]]-and-[[electrolyte]]s rehydration drink on members of the Gators football team of coach [[Ray Graves]], first with members of the [[freshman]] squad, and after initially promising results, with starting members of the [[varsity team]].<ref name=han2242003/>  "It didn't taste like Gatorade," Cade said in a 1988 interview with ''[[Florida Trend]]'' magazine.<ref name=martin11282007/>  In fact, according to Cade, when one Gator football player tried it, he spat it out and strongly suggested that the original experimental formula tasted more like bodily waste.<ref name=martin11282007/>  Dana Shires remembered that "it sort of tasted like toilet bowl cleaner."<ref name=times11292007>"[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2962479.ece  Robert Cade: Scientist who invented Gatorade, the world's first and biggest-selling sports drink]," ''The Times'' (November 29, 2007).</ref>  To make it more palatable, at the suggestion of Cade's wife, the researchers added lemon juice and [[cyclamate]]<ref name=burnett4161994>Richard Burnett, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-04-16/business/9404160734_1_cade-gatorade-innovation-workshop  Gatorade Inventor: My Success Based On Sweat And Luck]," ''Orlando Sentinel'' (April 16, 1994).  Retrieved February 16, 2010.  Other sweeteners were substituted in 1970, when the federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned [[cyclamate]] as a potential [[carcinogen]].</ref> to the original formula of water, [[salt]], [[sodium citrate]], [[fructose]] and [[monopotassium phosphate]].<ref name=times11292007/>

Cade appeared in "The Legend of Gatorade" television commercials narrated by long-time college football announcer [[Keith Jackson]] in 2005,<ref>Dan Wetzel, "[http://sports.yahoo.com/top/news?slug=dw-gatorade092205&prov=yhoo&type=lgns  Gatorade's secret formula]," Yahoo Sports! (September 22, 2005).  Retrieved February 18, 2010.</ref> during which Cade declared, "Naturally, we called our stuff ''Gator''ade."<ref>''See'' "[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpCSvV70SCY  The Legend of Gatorade]" (long version of commercial without Keith Jackson narration) Youtube.com (2005).</ref>  However, the rehydration drink was first known as "Cade's Cola" to the Florida Gators football team, and only later became known as "Gatorade."<ref name=times11292007/>  The drink received its first real test in the Gators' 1965 game against the [[LSU Tigers football]] team; the Tigers faded in the 102-degree heat of the second half and the Gators did not.<ref name=martin11282007/>  Coach Graves was convinced, and asked Cade to produce enough of his potion for all Gator games.  Gatorade achieved national notoriety as a result of the Gators' first [[Orange Bowl]] title over the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] in January 1967.<ref name=times11292007/>  The Gators reinforced their reputation as a "second-half team" and came from behind to defeat the Yellow Jackets 27&ndash;10.<ref>College Football Data Warehouse, All-Time Coaching Records, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/coaching/alltime_coach_game_by_game.php?coachid=905&year=1966  Ray Graves 1966]. Retrieved February 19, 2010.</ref>  Afterward, Georgia Tech coach [[Bud Carson]] told reporters: "We didn't have Gatorade; that made the difference."<ref name=times11292007/>

Cade [[patent]]ed the formula and offered the rights to the drink to the University of Florida in exchange for the university's backing of the production and marketing of the drink, but the university turned down his proposal.<ref name=mit>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Inventor of the Week Archive, [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/cade.html  Inventor of the Week: Robert Cade].  Retrieved February 17, 2010.</ref>  He initially obtained bank financing and began to produce "Gatorade" through his own business, but later entered into a contract with [[Stokely-Van Camp's|Stokely-Van Camp, Inc.]] to produce and sell the drink.<ref name=burnett4161994/>  When sales [[royalties]] reached $200,000, the university took notice&mdash;and asked for the patent rights.  Cade refused.  The university brought suit against him for a share of the profits, arguing that its facilities, employees and students were instrumental in the development of the product.<ref name=curtis4142007>Dave Curtis, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-04-14/sports/GATORADE14_1_gatorade-cade-uf  Making A Splash]," ''Orlando Sentinel'' (April 14, 2007).  Retrieved February 17, 2010.</ref>  After thirty-one months of legal wrangling, Cade and the university negotiated a settlement of their dispute in 1972&mdash;with the university settling for a twenty percent share of the royalties.<ref name=curtis4142007/>

== Legacy ==

Through 2007, the latest year for which figures are publicly available, the University of Florida has realized over $110 million from its share of the Gatorade royalties.<ref name=curtis4142007/><ref>The University of Florida has since become one of the largest public research universities in the United States, and derives significant annual income from the patent royalties generated by the inventions of its professors and other research staff.  ''See, e.g.,'' Mike Thomas, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-05-07/news/8905075093_1_uf-patent-royalties  Gator Aid: What UF Is Thirsty For]," ''Orlando Sentinel'' (May 7, 1989).  Retrieved February 17, 2010.</ref>  Cade and his associates' share of the royalties is undisclosed, the majority of their rights having been sold to Stokely-Van Camp.<ref name=curtis4142007/>  After the settlement, Cade continued to work for the university, and the college of medicine named him professor emeritus of nephrology upon his retirement in 2004.  In April 2007, several months before his death, the [[University of Florida Athletic Association|University Athletic Association]] inducted Cade into the University of Florida Sports Hall of Fame.<ref name=curtis4142007/>

Gatorade, now owned by [[PepsiCo]], is today sold in some eighty countries and over fifty various flavors.<ref name=times11292007/>  In stark contrast to the $43 Cade and his team spent to make the first experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965,<ref name=times11292007/> Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multi-billion dollar sports drink industry in the years that followed.  While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink,<ref name=ap11272007/> Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea in children.<ref>Charles Fishman, "[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-05-24/news/9205221228_1_cade-gatorade-studebaker  A Few Moments With . . .

Retrieved February 18, 2010.</ref>  Cade's other research included [[hypertension]], [[exercise physiology]], [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]] and [[kidney disease]].<ref name=times11292007/>

Cade was a talented violinist who sometimes played with local [[symphony orchestra]]s.<ref name=times11292007/>  In his later years, Cade was known for indulging in his eccentric collections of [[violin]]s and more than fifty vintage [[Studebaker]] automobiles.<ref name=ap11272007/>  He and his wife continued to live in the same Gainesville house that they owned before the financial success of Gatorade.<ref name=curtis4142007/>  On November 27, 2007, Cade died of [[kidney failure]], at the age of 80, in Gainesville.<ref name=ap11272007/>  He was survived by his wife Mary Strasburger Cade, their six children Michael Cade, Stephen Cade, Martha Cade, Celia Cade Johnson, Emily Cade Morrison and Phoebe Cade Miles, twenty grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.<ref name=martin11282007/>
