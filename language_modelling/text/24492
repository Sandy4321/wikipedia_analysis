The '''Battle of Kupres''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], {{lang-sr|Bitka za Kupres}}) was a battle of the [[Bosnian War]], fought between the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) and the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) on one side and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) on the other from 20 October to 3 November 1994. The battle marks the first tangible evidence of [[Bosniak]]&ndash;[[Bosnian Croat|Croat]] alliance set out in the [[Washington Agreement]] of March 1994, brokered by the [[United States]] to end the [[Croat<U+2013>Bosniak War]] fought between the ARBiH and the HVO in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The ARBiH and the HVO were not coordinated at first, rather they launched separate operations aimed at capture of [[Kupres]].

The ARBiH offensive [[codename]]d '''Autumn-94''' (''Jesen-94'') started on 20 October, with the primary aim of advancing from Bugojno towards VRS-held [[Donji Vakuf]], supported by a secondary attack towards Kupres aimed at disruption of the VRS defences and threatening a supply route to Donji Vakuf. The primary attacking force soon ground to a halt and the focus of the operation shifted to Kupres, where substantial reinforcements were deployed to ensure a gradual advance of the ARBiH. On 29 October, the HVO decided to attack as it considered the ARBiH had directly threatened the strategic Kupres plateau. The HVO launched its offensive, codenamed '''Operation Cincar''' (''Operacija Cincar''), on 1 November. Following a brief lull in the ARBiH advance, thought to be brought on by a variety of causes and a direct request by the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Alija Izetbegovi<U+0107>]] to the ARBiH to cooperate with the HVO, commanding officers of the two forces met to coordinate their operations for the first time since the Washington Agreement. Kupres itself was captured by the HVO on 3 November 1994.

Besides the political significance of the battle for future developments of the [[War in Bosnia]], the battle was militarily significant for planning and execution of [[Operation Winter '94]] by the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) and the HVO aimed at relieving the [[siege of Biha<U+0107>]] in late November and December 1994. Territorial gains made by the HVO and the ARBiH in the Battle of Kupres safeguarded the right flank of Operation Winter '94.

==Background==
{{main|Croatian War of Independence|Bosnian War}}
The [[Log Revolution|1990 revolt]] of the [[Serbs of Croatia|Croatian Serbs]] was centered on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around the city of [[Knin]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}</ref> parts of [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] regions and in [[eastern Croatia]]n settlements with significant Serb population,<ref name=MarticICTY>{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}</ref> and the areas were subsequently named the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK). The RSK declared intention of political integration with [[Serbia]] and was viewed by the [[Government of Croatia]] as a rebellion.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}</ref> By March 1991, the conflict escalated to war&mdash;the [[Croatian War of Independence]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}</ref> In June 1991, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared its independence]] as [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia disintegrated]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|26 June 1991}}</ref> followed by a three-month moratorium on the decision,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|29 June 1991}}</ref> thus the decision came into effect on 8 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|8 October 1991}}</ref> A campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] was then initiated by the RSK against Croatian civilians and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, less than 400 and 1,500&ndash;2,000 ethnic Croats remained in UN protected areas Sector South,<ref>{{harvnb|Department of State|31 January 1994}}</ref> and Sector North respectively.<ref name=UNCHR>{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section J, points 147 & 150}}</ref>

As the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the [[Croatian Police|Croatian police]] was unable to cope with the situation, the [[Croatian National Guard]] (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) in November.<ref>{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272<U+2013>278}}</ref> The establishment of the [[military of Croatia]] was hampered by a [[United Nations]] (UN) [[arms embargo]] introduced in September.<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}</ref> The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the [[Battle of the barracks]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|24 September 1991}}</ref> the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]],<ref>{{harvnb|Bjelajac|<U+017D>unec|2009|pp=249<U+2013>250}}</ref> and the [[Battle of Vukovar]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|18 November 1991}}</ref>

In January 1992, the [[Sarajevo Agreement]] was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and fighting between the two sides was paused.<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire">{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 January 1992}}</ref> Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires, [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia<U+2014>to supervise and maintain the agreement.<ref>{{harvnb|Los Angeles Times|29 January 1992}}</ref> The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], where a new conflict was anticipated,<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"/> but Serbia continued to support the RSK.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2012|p=417}}</ref> HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control&mdash;as the siege of [[Dubrovnik]] was lifted,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|15 July 1992}}</ref> and in [[Operation Maslenica]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|24 January 1993}}</ref> Croatian towns and villages were intermittently attacked by artillery,<ref>{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section K, point 161}}</ref> or missiles.<ref name=MarticICTY/><ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|13 September 1993}}</ref>

As the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new [[Bosnian Serb]] army, as Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February <U+2013> 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina&mdash;which would later be cited as a pretext for the [[Bosnian War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=382}}</ref> Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital, [[Sarajevo]] and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and [[Doboj]]. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started artillery attacks on [[Bosanski Brod]], and the HV 108th Brigade crossed the border adjacent to the town in reply.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=427}}</ref> On 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=428}}</ref> Even though the war originally pitted Bosnian Serbs against non-Serbs in the country, it evolved into a three-sided conflict by the end of the year, as the [[Croat<U+2013>Bosniak War]] started.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=10}}</ref> By that time, the Bosnian Serb army<U+2014>renamed [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) after the [[Republika Srpska]] state proclaimed in the Bosnian Serb-held territory<U+2014>controlled about 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=433}}</ref> That proportion would not change significantly over the next two years.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=443}}</ref> Republika Srpska was involved in the Croatian War of Independence in a limited capacity, through military and other aid to the RSK, occasional air raids launched from [[Banja Luka]], and most significantly through artillery attacks against urban centres.<ref>{{harvnb|The Seattle Times|16 July 1992}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|17 August 1995}}</ref>

==Prelude==
[[File:Kupres01770.JPG|right|thumb|Kupres, objective of Operation Cincar and Autumn-94]]
Following a new military strategy of the [[United States]] endorsed by [[Bill Clinton]] since February 1993,<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|2010|p=432}}</ref> and the [[Washington Agreement]] was signed by Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1994. The agreement ended the Croat<U+2013>Bosniak War,<ref name="JL-Winter">{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|9 December 2007}}</ref> and established the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="Ramet 2006 439">{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=439}}</ref> The political settlement allowed the ARBiH and the HVO to deploy additional troops against the VRS in a series of small-scale attacks designed to wear down the Bosnian Serb military, but the attacks claimed no territorial gains before October.<ref name=BB251>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=251}}</ref> The ARBiH adopted an [[attrition warfare]] strategy relying on its numerical superiority compared to the VRS, which suffered from manpower shortages. The strategy was aimed at limited advances, without support of heavy weapons and means of transport&mdash;unavailable to the ARBiH at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=223}}</ref>

In March&ndash;November 1994, the ARBiH conducted a series of attacks with relatively limited objectives, attacking the VRS at the [[Vla<U+0161>i<U+0107> (mountain)|Vla<U+0161>i<U+0107> Mountain]], the Stolice Peak of the [[Majevica]] Mountain, [[Donji Vakuf]], as well as in the area between [[Te<U+0161>anj]] and [[Tesli<U+0107>]], near [[Br<U+010D>ko (town)|Br<U+010D>ko]], [[Kladanj]], Sarajevo, on the [[Bjela<U+0161>nica]] and the [[Treskavica]] Mountain, [[Gra<U+010D>anica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gra<U+010D>anica]], [[Vare<U+0161>]], [[Konjic]] and Doboj. Further efforts were made together with the HVO, against the VRS near [[Nevesinje]] in September&ndash;November, but most of the offensives made little or no gains. At the same time, VRS attacks north of Sarajevo were successfully repulsed.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=235<U+2013>242}}</ref> It was hoped by the ARBiH General Staff that the VRS could not muster sufficient reserves to hold off the simultaneous, albeit relatively limited attacks.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=230<U+2013>231}}</ref> Little territory changed hands as a result of the ARBiH offensive by the end of October, but the VRS shortage of troops worsened.<ref name=BB251/>

[[Kupres]] was of interest to the ARBiH and the HVO, albeit for different reasons. The HVO wanted to reverse [[Battle of Kupres (1992)|April 1992 loss of the town]], home to a significant [[Croat]] community before the war, and to control the [[Tomislavgrad]]<U+2013>[[Bugojno]]<U+2013>[[<U+0160>ipovo]] road. The ARBiH advance towards Kupres was planned as a secondary axis of its offensive towards Donji Vakuf, {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} to the northwest, [[codename]]d Autumn-94.<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|pp=88<U+2013>90}}</ref> The ARBiH wanted to deny the VRS a supply route passing through Kupres in order to weaken VRS defence around Donji Vakuf.<ref name=BB242>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=242}}</ref> It is not clear how were the ARBiH and the HVO coordinated before their advance to Kupres. Most probably, the two forces' commands agreed on a simultaneous offensive against Kupres, without revealing actual battle plans to their counterparts. The HVO's contribution in the offensive, codenamed Operation Cincar, was planned jointly by the HVO and the HV.<ref name=BB243>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=243}}</ref>

==Order of battle==
Initially, the ARBiH committed 3,130 troops to its secondary axis&mdash;the thrust towards Kupres.<ref name=Ramic92>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=92}}</ref> They were organized in the 370th Mountain Infantry Brigade on the right flank of the {{convert|14|km|adj=on}} front manned by the [[7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBiH 7th Corps]] southwest of Bugojno, and the 307th Mountain Infantry Brigade on the left flank of the ARBiH effort.<ref name=Ramic100>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=100}}</ref> In the primary attack axis zone, the ARBiH grouped about 5,600 additional troops, facing an estimated 4,800 VRS soldiers around Donji Vakuf. Kupres itself and the surrounding plateau was defended by approximately 2,700 VRS troops,<ref name=Ramic92/> assigned to the 7th Motorized Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Krajina Corps,<ref name=Ramic85>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=85}}</ref> supported by corps-level artillery and armour.<ref name=Ramic87>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=87}}</ref> The bulk of the HVO force comprised troops contributed by the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd Guards Brigades, supported by the [[Bosnian Croat]] special police and the 60th Guards Airborne Battalion "Ludvig Pavlovi<U+0107>". Even though participation of the HV in the battle was denied by Croatia, it is thought to have likely occurred.<ref name=BB243/> Specifically, the [[Special Operations Battalion (Croatia)|1st Croatian Guards Brigade]] is thought to have taken part in the battle,<ref name=Ramic132>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=132}}</ref> and Bosnian Croat reports pertaining to the battle specify the "Zrinski" Battalion of the brigade as taking part in the operation.<ref name=HRHB4/> The ARBiH 7th Corps was commanded by [[Brigadier General]] [[Mehmed Alagi<U+0107>]], while the HVO Tomislavgrad Corps, formally in control of Operation Cincar, was commanded by [[Colonel]] Josip <U+010C>erni.<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=141}}</ref> The VRS 2nd Krajina Corps was under command of Colonel Radivoje Tomani<U+0107>.<ref>{{harvnb|SVK|6 December 1994}}</ref>

The ARBiH launched the secondary axis of Operation Autumn-94&mdash;drive towards Kupres&mdash;at 2&nbsp;am on 20 October,<ref name=BB242/> hours after the primary attacking force started moving against Donji Vakuf.<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|pp=99<U+2013>100}}</ref> As the primary effort of the ARBiH offensive bogged down the same day, Kupres became the main objective.

Since the beginning of the ARBiH offensive, the HVO was assembling three of its four guards brigades under command of General [[Ante Roso]], as well as other supporting units, including the 60th Guards Airborne Battalion.<ref name=BB243/> On 29 October, the Ministry of Defence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] and the HVO General Staff met and decided to launch Operation Cincar to capture the town of Kupres. The decision was reportedly motivated by a desire to consolidate territory controlled by the HVO around Kupres and by the strategic importance of the Kupres plateau which commanded the northern approaches to the HVO-held [[Livanjsko field]]. The operation was originally scheduled for 31 October at 4:30&nbsp;am, only to be postponed by 24&nbsp;hours as the HVO needed more time to prepare. Delayed arrival of reconnaissance teams further postponed the HVO offensive until 8&nbsp;am on 1 November 1994.<ref name=HRHB4>{{harvnb|HRHB|4 November 1994}}</ref>

===November===
The HVO advanced north along two main axes of attack. The western axis advanced from [[<U+0160>uica (Tomislavgrad)|<U+0160>uica]] along the main road towards Kupres, capturing the village of [[Donji Malovan]] on 1 November. The eastern axis of the HVO offensive moved from Ravno towards [[Rili<U+0107>, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Rili<U+0107>]]. Just as the HVO began to move north, the ARBiH suspended its westward advance. Various explanations for the pause were put forward, including fog, rain, need to secure territorial gains, wear of equipment and fatigue of personnel.<ref name=BB242243>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=242<U+2013>243}}</ref> Regardless, that day the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Alija Izetbegovi<U+0107>]] telephoned Alagi<U+0107> requesting an adequate level of cooperation and avoidance of any conflicts with the HVO.<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=135}}</ref> Finally, Alagi<U+0107> made a public call to the HVO to participate in the offensive against the VRS in Kupres.<ref name=BBN237>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 237/V}}</ref> The same day, the VRS targeted Bugojno using two [[9K52 Luna-M]] missiles.<ref name="Ramic132"/>

On 2 November, the HVO captured [[Gornji Malovan]] and Rili<U+0107>, while the [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb]] civilian population started to evacuate from Kupres.<ref name=BB243/> Alagi<U+0107> visited the HVO Tomislavgrad Corps headquarters to discuss cooperation, but refused to discuss the matter, citing inadequate officers present there, and proposed a new meeting at 11&nbsp;pm that day at the ARBiH 317th Brigade headquarters in [[Gornji Vakuf]].<ref name=Ramic137141>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|pp=137<U+2013>141}}</ref> The Chief of the HVO General Staff, [[Major General]] [[Tihomir Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107>]] made a written apology on behalf of the HVO claiming the HVO officers had to be elsewhere at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=162}}</ref> A new meeting took place as proposed by Alagi<U+0107>. The meeting concluded at 3&nbsp;am, with an agreement between Alagi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erni to withdraw some of the ARBiH troops on the right flank of the HVO thrust to allow the HVO to strike Kupres from that direction, and coordinate their further advances beyond Kupres.<ref name=Ramic137141/> Even though the cooperation was established, there was no joint command of the ARBiH and the HVO.<ref name=BBN237/>

The ARBiH pullback was completed by 11&nbsp;am on 3 November, while the right flank of the ARBiH force pressed forward to capture the Kupre<U+0161>ka Vrata Pass,<ref>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|p=142}}</ref> {{convert|3|km|abbr=off}} away from Kupres. The Bosnian Croat special police and the 60th Guards Airborne Battalion entered Kupres shortly after noon,<ref name=BB243/> and the HVO completed capture of the town by 1:30&nbsp;pm.<ref name=HRHB3>{{harvnb|HRHB|3 November 1994}}</ref> The HVO proceeded to capture nearly the entire Kupres plateau, bringing the 1st, the 79th and the 80th Home Guards Regiments of the HVO to hold defensive positions on the plateau.<ref name=HRHB4/> The VRS was unable to counter-attack in a timely manner because it had no reserves in place for the task.<ref>{{harvnb|Ripley|1999|p=86}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
The ARBiH significantly shortened its positions held opposite the VRS and captured {{convert|130|km2|abbr=off}} of territory,<ref name=Ramic149150>{{harvnb|Rami<U+0107>|2004|pp=149<U+2013>150}}</ref> while the HVO captured nearly {{convert|400|km2|abbr=off}} of the area around Kupres.<ref>{{harvnb|Kupre<U+0161>ki Radio|3 November 2012}}</ref> Battle losses of the ARBiH amounted to 41 killed in action and 162 wounded troops.<ref name=Ramic149150/> By 3 November, 4 HVO troops were killed and 15 wounded,<ref name=HRHB3/> and further 3 soldiers died and 5 were wounded in a VRS counter-attack near [[Zlosela]] at 11&nbsp;am on 4 November.<ref name=HRHB4/>

The Battle of Kupres was the first concrete result of the renewed Bosniak&ndash;Croat alliance in the Bosnian War,<ref>{{harvnb|Caspersen|2010|p=155}}</ref> and the advance to Kupres was the first military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement.<ref name=BB242243/><ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|loc=note 227/V}}</ref> Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the [[Split, Croatia|Split]]<U+2013>Livno<U+2013>Kupres<U+2013>Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of arms and ammunition,<ref name=Ramic149150/> especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994.<ref>{{harvnb|Bono|2003|p=107}}</ref> The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia.<ref name="Ramet 2006 439"/> Finally, the outcome of the Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when [[Operation Winter '94]] was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force [[Siege of Biha<U+0107>|besieging Biha<U+0107>]] and prevent capture of Biha<U+0107> by the VRS.<ref name="JL-Winter"/> The battle is considered to be a significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.<ref>{{harvnb|Hrvatski vojnik|July 2010}}</ref>
