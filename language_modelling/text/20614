The '''A426 road''' is a road in [[England]] which runs from the city of [[Leicester]] to [[Southam]] in [[Warwickshire]] via [[Lutterworth]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]].

==History==

Until the [[M1 Motorway]] was completed in the 1960's this route formed the main route between Rugby and Leicester, now much quieter as all but local traffic uses the Motorway.

The A426 crosses the route of the former [[A45 road|A45]] in [[Dunchurch]], this would of formed one of the main routes between the Midlands and South East. Dunchurch is now bypassed to the South by the [[M45 Motorway]], and the A426 no longer meets the A45

==Route==

The A426 starts on the [[Leicester]] Inner Ring Road, heading South through the suburbs of the City, crossing the Outer Ring Road and bypassing the village of [[Blaby]]. It crosses over the [[M1 motorway|M1]] which it runs parallel to for the next 10 miles or so. The road becomes rural in nature until entering the small town of [[Lutterworth]] and crossing the A4303 Southern Bypass. A further 2 miles South and it crosses the [[A5 road|A5]] [[Watling Street]] at a roundabout and eventually the [[M6 Motorway|M6]] junction 1. It starts a descent into [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] as a dual carriageway with 5 local access roundabouts. Approaching the Town Centre the road becomes single carriageway again and crosses under the [[West Coast Main Line]]. It passes the main Town Centre to the West and heads Southwards out of the town towards [[Dunchurch]]. The road passes over the [[M45 Motorway|M45]] and once again becomes a rural road for its final length to terminate on the [[A423 road|A423]] [[Southam]] bypass.

==Former Routes==
The A426, compared to other routes is a relatively untouched road, with only a single bypass:
* The road used to travel through the village of [[Blaby]], now bypassed
