The '''Bible''' refers to the sacred scriptures of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] comprises the books known to Christians as the [[Old Testament]] which contains two-thirds of the books of the Christian Bible<U+2014>39 books. The remaining 27 books form the Christian [[New Testament]].

The Christian Bible consists of the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox versions of the Old Testament are slightly larger because of their acceptance of certain books and parts of books considered apocryphal by [[Protestants]]. The Jewish Bible includes only the books known to Christians as the Old Testament. The arrangements of the Jewish and Christian canons differ considerably. The Protestant and Roman Catholic arrangements more nearly match one another.

The [[Hebrew Bible]], composed between the 14th and 5th centuries BCE, is the main source for the history of ancient [[Kingdom of Israel|Israel]]. The five books of the [[Torah]] comprise the origins of the Israelite nation and its covenant with God. The [[Prophets]] consist of prophetic and ethical teachings, as well as the historic account of Israel. The Writings such as Psalms and Job are poetic and philosophical works. Israelite historians presented a picture of the ancient nation based on information that they viewed as historically accurate. Like modern historians, Hebrew writers provided historical explanations or background information of the events they describe (e.g., {{Bibleref2|1Samuel|28:3||1 Sam. 28:3}}, {{Bibleref2|1Kings|18:3b||1 Kings 18:3b}}, {{Bibleref2|2Kings|9:14b-15a||2 Kings 9:14b-15a}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|2Kings|13:5-6}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|2Kings|15:12}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|2Kings|17:7-23}}).<ref>Halpern, B. ''the First Historians: The Hebrew Bible.'' Harper & Row, 1988, quoted in Smith, Mark S.''The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.; 2nd ed., 2002. ISBN 978-0802839725, p.14</ref>

Judaism recognizes a single set of [[Development of the Jewish Bible canon|canonical books]] known as the ''[[Tanakh]]'', also called [[Hebrew Bible]], traditionally divided into three parts: the ''[[Torah]]'' ("teaching" or "law"), the ''[[Nevi'im]]'' ("prophets"), and the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' ("writings").

The Bible as used by [[Christians]] today includes the Jewish or [[Hebrew Bible]] as part of its "[[Old Testament]]" canon. Author Philip Yancey has pointed out that the Bible [[Jesus]] read was the Old Testament essentially as we know it today.<ref>Yancey, Philip D. ''The Bible Jesus Read.'' Zondervan, 1999. ISBN 978-0310228349</ref> Books which are largely overlooked or misunderstood by  modern  Christians, such as Job, Deuteronomy, Ecclesiastes, the prophets, etc., are books in which Jesus himself spent time and used in some of his quotes.

Soon after the establishment of Christianity in the first century, Church fathers compiled Gospel accounts and letters of apostles into a Christian Bible which became known as the [[New Testament]]. The Old and New Testaments together are referred to as "The Holy Bible" by Christians. The canonical composition of the Jewish Bible is in dispute between Christian groups: [[Protestant]]s hold only the books of the Hebrew Bible to be canonical; [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] additionally consider the [[deuterocanonical]] books, a group of Jewish books, to be canonical. The New Testament is composed of the [[Gospels]] ("good news"), the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the [[Epistles#New Testament epistles|Epistles]] (letters), and the [[Book of Revelation]].

In other uses, the term "bible" is sometimes used to refer to a comprehensive guidebook on a particular subject.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Family-bible.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An American family Bible dating to 1859 A.D.]]

According to the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word ''bible''<ref name="etymonline-bible">{{OEtymD|bible}}</ref> is from the Latin ''biblia'', traced from the same word through [[Medieval Latin]] and [[Late Latin]], as used in the phrase ''biblia sacra'' ("holy book")<U+2014>"In the Latin of the Middle Ages, the neuter plural for Biblia (gen. ''bibliorum'') gradually came to be regarded as a feminine singular noun (''biblia,'' gen. ''bibliae'' in which singular form the word has passed into the languages of the Western world.")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02543a.htm |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref> This stemmed from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''{{polytonic|<U+03C4><U+1F70> <U+03B2><U+03B9><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+1F70> <U+1F05><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03B1>}}'' (''ta biblia ta hagia''), "the holy books", which derived from ''<U+03B2><U+03B9><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03BD>'' (''biblion''),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2319917 Biblion, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A'' Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus].</ref> "paper" or "scroll," the ordinary word for "[[book]]", which was originally a diminutive of ''<U+03B2><U+03CD><U+03B2><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>'' (''byblos'', "Egyptian papyrus"), possibly so called from the name of the [[Phoenicia]]n port [[Byblos]] (also known as Gebal) from whence Egyptian [[papyrus]] was exported to Greece.

== Jewish canon ==
{{Judaism}}{{main|Tanakh}}

The Tanakh ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|<U+05EA><U+05E0>"<U+05DA>}}) consists of 24 books. Tanakh is an acronym for the three parts of the Hebrew Bible: the [[Torah]] ("Teaching/Law" also known as the [[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] ("Prophets"), and [[Ketuvim]] ("Writings," or [[Hagiographa]]), and is used commonly by Jews but unfamiliar to many English speakers and others {{ref_harvard|Alexander|Alexander 1999, p. 17|none}}.
(See [[Table of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture]].)

=== Torah ===
{{main|Torah}}
The Torah, or "Instruction," is also known as the "Five Books" of [[Moses]], thus [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] from Hebrew meaning "fivesome," and [[Pentateuch]] from Greek meaning "five scroll-cases."

The Torah comprises the following five books:
# [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], <small>Ge</small><U+2014>Bereshith (<U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05EA>)
# [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], <small>Ex</small><U+2014>Shemot (<U+05E9><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05EA>)
# [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], <small>Le</small><U+2014>Vayikra (<U+05D5><U+05D9><U+05E7><U+05E8><U+05D0>)
# [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], <small>Nu</small><U+2014>Bamidbar (<U+05D1><U+05DE><U+05D3><U+05D1><U+05E8>)
# [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], <small>Dt</small><U+2014>Devarim (<U+05D3><U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05DD>)

The Hebrew book titles come from some of the first words in the respective texts.

The Torah focuses on three moments in the changing relationship between God and people. The first eleven chapters of Genesis provide accounts of the [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] (or ordering) of the world and the history of God's early relationship with humanity. The remaining thirty-nine chapters of Genesis provide an account of God's covenant with the Hebrew [[patriarch]]s, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] (also called [[Israel]]), and Jacob's children (the "[[Children of Israel]]"), especially [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]. It tells of how God commanded Abraham to leave his family and home in the city of [[Ur]], eventually to settle in the land of [[Canaan]], and how the Children of Israel later moved to Egypt. The remaining four books of the Torah tell the story of [[Moses]], who lived hundreds of years after the patriarchs. His story coincides with the story of the liberation of the Children of Israel from slavery in [[Ancient Egypt]], to the renewal of their covenant with God at [[Mount Sinai]], and their wanderings in the desert until a new generation would be ready to enter the land of Canaan. The Torah ends with the death of Moses.

The Torah contains the commandments, of God, revealed at Mount Sinai (although there is some debate amongst Jewish scholars as to whether this was written down completely in one moment, or if it was spread out during the 40 years in the wandering in the desert). These commandments provide the basis for [[Halakha]] (Jewish religious law). Tradition states that the number of these is equal to [[613 Mitzvot]] or 613 commandments. There is some dispute as to how to divide these up (mainly between the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] and [[Rambam]]).

The Torah is divided into fifty-four portions which are read on successive [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]s in Jewish liturgy, from the beginning of Genesis to the end of Deuteronomy. The cycle ends and recommences at the end of [[Sukkot]], which is called [[Simchat Torah]].

=== Nevi'im ===
{{main|Nevi'im}}

The [[Nevi'im]], or "Prophets," tell the story of the rise of the Hebrew monarchy, its division into two kingdoms, and the prophets who, in God's name, warned the kings and the Children of Israel about the punishment of God. It ends with the conquest of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians and the conquest of the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians, and the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Portions of the prophetic books are read by Jews on the Sabbath ([[Shabbat]]). The [[Book of Jonah]] is read on [[Yom Kippur]].

According to Jewish tradition, Nevi'im is divided into eight books. Contemporary translations subdivide these into twenty-one books.

The Nevi'im comprise the following eight books:

* 6. [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], <small>Js</small><U+2014>Yehoshua (<U+05D9><U+05D4><U+05D5><U+05E9><U+05E2>)

=== Ketuvim ===
{{main|Ketuvim}}

The [[Ketuvim]], or "Writings" or "Scriptures," may have been written during or after the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian Exile]]. According to Rabbinic tradition{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and superscriptions to the Psalms themselves, many of the psalms in the book of [[Psalms]] are attributed to [[David (biblical king)|David]]; [[King Solomon]] is believed to have written [[Song of Songs]] in his youth, [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] at the prime of his life, and [[Ecclesiastes]] at old age; and the prophet [[Jeremiah]] is thought to have written [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]]. The [[Book of Ruth]] is the only biblical book that centers entirely on a non-Jew. The book of Ruth tells the story of a non-Jew (specifically, a [[Moab]]ite) who married a Jew and, upon his death, [[Proselyte|followed in the ways of the Jews]]; according to the Bible, she was the great-grandmother of [[King David]]. Five of the books, called "The Five Scrolls" (Megilot), are read on Jewish holidays: Song of Songs on [[Passover]]; the [[Book of Ruth]] on [[Shavuot]]; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] on the [[Ninth of Av]]; Ecclesiastes on [[Sukkot]]; and the [[Book of Esther]] on [[Purim]]. Collectively, the Ketuvim contain lyrical poetry, philosophical reflections on life, and the stories of the prophets and other Jewish leaders during the Babylonian exile. It ends with the Persian decree allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple.

The Ketuvim comprise the following eleven books, divided, in many modern translations, into twelve through the division of Ezra and Nehemiah:

* 14. [[Psalms]], <small>Ps</small><U+2014>Tehillim (<U+05EA><U+05D4><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DD>)
* 15. [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], <small>Pr</small><U+2014>Mishlei (<U+05DE><U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05D9>)
* 16. [[Book of Job|Job]], <small>Jb</small><U+2014>Iyyov (<U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05D1>)
* 17. [[Song of Songs]], <small>So</small><U+2014>Shir ha-Shirim (<U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05E8> <U+05D4><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05DD>)
* 18. [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], <small>Ru</small><U+2014>Rut (<U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05EA>)
* 19. [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], <small>La</small><U+2014>Eikhah (<U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05DB><U+05D4>), also called Kinot (<U+05E7><U+05D9><U+05E0><U+05D5><U+05EA>)

=== Hebrew Bible translations and editions ===
{{main|Bible translations}}

The Tanakh was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csbbc.net/bible.html |title=Bible Study, Bible Facts |accessdate=2007-11-05 |work= }}</ref>

=== The Oral Torah ===
{{citations missing|section|date=April 2010}}
According to some Jews during the [[Hellenistic period]], such as the [[Sadducees]], only a minimal oral tradition of interpreting the words of the Torah existed, which did not include extended biblical interpretation. According to the [[Pharisee]]s, however, God revealed both a Written Torah and an [[Oral Torah]] to Moses, the Oral Torah consisting of both stories and legal traditions. In Rabbinic Judaism, the Oral Torah is essential for understanding the Written Torah literally (as it includes neither vowels nor punctuation) and [[exegesis|exegetically]]. The Oral Torah has different facets, principally [[Halacha]] (laws), the [[Aggadah]] (stories), and the [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric knowledge). Major portions of the Oral Law have been committed to writing, notably the [[Mishnah]]; the [[Tosefta]]; [[Midrash]], such as [[Midrash Rabbah]], the [[Sifre]], the [[Sifra]], and the [[Mechilta]]; and both the Babylonian and Jerusalem [[Talmud]]s as well.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] continues to accept the Oral Torah in its totality. [[Masorti]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] state that the Oral Tradition is to some degree divinely inspired, but disregard its legal elements in varying degrees. [[Reform Judaism]] also gives some credence to the Talmud containing the legal elements of the Oral Torah, but, as with the written Torah, asserts that both were inspired by, but not dictated by, God. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] denies any connection of the Torah, Written or Oral, with God.

The article ''[[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]]'' discusses the Jewish understanding of the Bible, including bible commentaries from the ancient [[Targums]] to classical [[Rabbinic literature]], the [[midrash]] literature, the classical [[Meforshim|medieval commentators]], and modern day Jewish bible commentaries.

== Christian canons of the Bible ==
{{Christianity}}
The Christian Bible consists of the Hebrew scriptures, which have been called the Old Testament, and some later writings known as the New Testament. "Testament" is a translation of the Greek <U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03B7> (''diatheke''), also often translated "covenant." It is a legal term denoting a formal and legally binding declaration of benefits to be given by one party to another (e.g., "last will and testament" in secular use). Here it does not connote mutuality; rather, it is a unilateral covenant offered by God to individuals.<ref name="Stagg" />

Some groups within Christianity include additional books as part of one or both of these "Testaments" of their sacred writings<U+2014>most prominent among which are the [[biblical apocrypha]] or [[deuterocanonical books]].

Significant versions of the English Christian Bible include the [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]], the [[RSV]], the [[KJV]], and the [[NIV]]. For a complete list, see [[List of English Bible translations]].

In Judaism, the term ''Christian Bible'' is commonly used to identify only those books like the New Testament which have been added by Christians to the [[Masoretic Text]], and excludes any reference to an ''Old Testament''.<ref>[http://www.aish.com/shavuottorah/shavuottorahdefault/Accuracy_of_Torah_Text.asp Accuracy of Torah Text].</ref>

=== Old Testament ===
{{main|Old Testament}}

The Old Testament consists of a collection of works composed at various times from the twelfth to the second century B.C. It was written in classical Hebrew, except some brief portions ({{Bibleref2|Ezra|4:8<U+2013>6:18}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Ezra|7:12<U+2013>26}}, {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|10:11}}, {{Bibleref2|Daniel|2:4<U+2013>7:28}}) which are in the Aramaic language, a sister language which became the ''lingua franca'' of the Semitic world.<ref name="Driver">Sir Godfrey Driver. "Introduction to the Old Testament of the New English Bible." Web:  30 Nov 2009</ref> Much of it, such as genealogies, poems and stories, are thought to have been handed down by word of mouth for many generations. Very few manuscripts are said to have survived the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.<ref name="Driver" />

The Old Testament is accepted by Christians as [[scripture]]. Broadly speaking, it is the same as the [[Hebrew Bible]]. However, the order of the books is not entirely the same as that found in Hebrew manuscripts and in the ancient versions. and varies from Judaism in interpretation and emphasis (see for example [[Isaiah 7:14]]). Several Christian denominations also incorporate additional books into their [[Biblical canon|canons]] of the Old Testament. A few groups consider particular translations to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]], notably the Greek [[Septuagint]], the Aramaic [[Peshitta]], and the English [[King James Version]].

==== Apocryphal or deuterocanonical books ====
{{citations missing|article|date=April 2010}}
The [[Septuagint]] (Greek translation, from Alexandria in Egypt under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]]) was generally abandoned in favour of the [[Masoretic]] text as the basis for translations of the Old Testament into [[Western world|Western]] languages from St. Jerome's Bible (the [[Vulgate]]) to the present day. In [[Eastern Christianity]], translations based on the Septuagint still prevail. Some modern Western translations make use of the Septuagint to clarify passages in the Masoretic text, where the Septuagint may preserve a variant reading of the Hebrew text. They also sometimes adopt variants that appear in other texts e.g. those discovered among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

A number of books which are part of the Peshitta or Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible are often referred to as [[deuterocanonical books]] by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e. deutero) canon. Most Protestants term these books as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and those of the Modern [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions do not accept the deuterocanonical books as canonical, although Protestant Bibles [[Biblical apocrypha|included them]] in Apocrypha sections until around the 1820s. However, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Churches include these books as part of their Old Testament.

The Roman Catholic Church recognizes:
* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]
* [[1 Maccabees]]
* [[2 Maccabees]]
* [[Wisdom of Solomon]]
* [[Sirach]] also called [[Ecclesiasticus]]
* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]
* [[The Letter of Jeremiah]] ([[Baruch]] Chapter 6)
* [[Book of Esther#Additions to Esther|Greek Additions to Esther]]
* [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]]
* [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]]
* [[Bel and the Dragon]]

In addition to those, the Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches recognize the following:

* [[3 Maccabees]]
* [[1 Esdras]]
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]
* [[Psalm 151]]

Some other Eastern Orthodox Churches include:

* [[2 Esdras]] i.e., Latin Esdras in the Russian and Georgian Bibles

There is also [[4 Maccabees]] which is only accepted as canonical in the Georgian Church, but was included by [[St. Jerome]] in an appendix to the [[Vulgate]], and is an appendix to the Greek Orthodox Bible, and it therefore sometimes included in collections of the Apocrypha.

The [[Anglican Church]]es uses some of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocryphal books]] liturgically. Therefore, editions of the Bible intended for use in the Anglican Church include the Deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church, plus [[1 Esdras]], [[2 Esdras]] and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], which were in the Vulgate appendix.

=== New Testament ===
{{main|New Testament}}

The New Testament is a collection of 27 books, of 4 different [[genres]] of Christian literature ([[Gospels]], one account of the [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[Epistles]] and an [[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalypse]]). [[Jesus]] is its central figure. The New Testament presupposes the inspiration of the Old (2 Timothy 3:16). Nearly all Christians recognize the New Testament (as stated below) as canonical [[Sacred text|scripture]]. These books can be grouped into:

The order of these books varies according to Church tradition. The New Testament books are ordered differently in the Catholic/Protestant tradition, the Slavonic tradition, the Syriac tradition and the Ethiopian tradition.

==== Original language ====
The books of the New Testament were written in [[Koine Greek]], the language of the earliest extant manuscripts, even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See [[Greek primacy]]. Some scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the Gospel of Matthew) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. Of these, a small number accept the Syriac Peshitta as representative of the original. See [[Aramaic primacy]]. The study of the Greek New Testament, not least the synoptic gospels,
has been said to present undergraduates "with a more demanding set of interlocking intellectual
challenges than any other subject in the university".<ref name="Wright1">Evans, Christopher. King's College London. Quoted in Wright, N.T. "New Testament Scholarship and Christian Discipleship." 5 Jun 2008. Web: 27 Feb 2010 [http://www.ridley.cam.ac.uk/documents/moulemem.pdf N.T.

When ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal glosses'') to correct their text<U+2014>especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line<U+2014>and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions and additions.

The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the versions that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]] (generally minimalist), the [[Byzantine text-type]] (generally maximalist), and the [[Western text-type]] (occasionally wild). Together they comprise most of the ancient manuscripts.

=== Christian theology ===
{{main|Christian theology}}

While individual books within the Christian Bible present narratives set in certain historical periods, most [[Christian denomination]]s teach that the Bible itself has an overarching message.{{fact|date=April 2010}}

The Bible has always been central to the life of the Christian church. Bible scholar [[N.T. Wright]] says Jesus himself was profoundly shaped by the scriptures<U+2014>the ancient Hebrew and Aramaic texts whose stories, songs, prophecy and wisdom permeated the Jewish world of his day. He adds that the earliest Christians also searched those same scriptures in their effort to understand what their living God had accomplished through the brief earthly life of Jesus. They regarded the ancient Israelites' scriptures as having reached a climactic fulfillment in Jesus himself, generating the "new covenant" prophesied by Jeremiah.<ref name="Wright">Wright, N.T. ''The Last Word: Scripture and the Authority of God<U+2014>Getting Beyond the Bible Wars.'' HarperCollins, 2005. ISBN 0060872616 / 9780060872618</ref>

There are wide differences of opinion among Christians as to how particular incidents as described in the Bible are to be interpreted and as to what meaning should be attached to various prophecies. However, Christians in general are in agreement as to the Bible's basic message. A general outline, as described by [[C. S. Lewis]], is as follows:<ref name="cslewis">[http://www.believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=815 A Summary of the Bible] by Lewis, CS: Believer's Web.</ref>

# At some point in the past, humanity chose to depart from God's will and began to [[sin]].
# Because no one is free from sin, people cannot deal with God directly, so God revealed Himself in ways people could understand.
# God called [[Abraham]] and his progeny to be the means for saving all of humanity.
# To this end, He gave the [[Halakha|Law]] to [[Moses]].
# The resulting nation of Israel went through cycles of sin and [[repentance]], yet the prophets show an increasing understanding of the Law as a moral, not just a ceremonial, force.
# Jesus brought a perfect understanding of the Mosaic Law, that of love and salvation.
# By His death and resurrection, all who believe are saved and reconciled to God.

Many [[Christians]], [[Muslims]], and [[Jews]] regard the Bible as inspired by [[God]] yet written fallibly by imperfect men. Many others, who identify themselves as [[biblical literalism|biblical literalists]], regard both the New and Old Testament as the [[Biblical inerrancy|undiluted Word of God]], spoken by God and written down in its perfect form by humans. Still others hold the [[Biblical infallibility]] perspective, that the Bible is free from error in spiritual but not scientific matters. "Bible scholars claim that discussions about the Bible must be put into its context within church history and then into the context of contemporary culture."<ref name="Wright" />

Belief in sacred texts is attested to in Jewish antiquity,<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''De vita Moysis'' 3.23.</ref><ref name="Josephus">Josephus, ''Contra Apion'' 1.8.</ref> and this belief can also be seen in the earliest of Christian writings.

== Canonization ==
{{main|Biblical Canon|Dating the Bible}}
The word "canon" etymologically means cane or reed. In early Christianity "canon" referred to a list of books approved for public reading. Books not on the list were referred to as "apocryphal" <U+2014> meaning they were for private reading only. Under Latin usage from the fourth century on, canon came to stand for a closed and authoritative list in the sense of rule or norm.<ref name="Stagg">Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology.'' Nashville: Broadman, 1962. ISBN 0-8054-1613-7.</ref>

=== Hebrew Bible ===
{{main|Development of the Jewish Bible canon}}
The New Testament refers to the threefold division of the Hebrew Scriptures: the law, the prophets, and the writings. {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:44}} refers to the "law of Moses" ([[Pentateuch]]), the "prophets" which include certain historical books in addition to the books now called "prophets," and the psalms (the "writings" designated by its most prominent collection). The Hebrew Bible probably was canonized in these three stages: the law canonized before the Exile, the prophets by the time of the Syrian persecution of the Jews, and the writings shortly after AD 70 (the fall of Jerusalem). About that time, early Christian writings began being accepted by Christians as "scripture." These events, taken together, may have caused the Jews to close their "canon." They listed their own recognized Scriptures and also excluded both Christian and Jewish writings considered by them to be "apocryphal." In this canon the thirty-nine books found in the Old Testament of today's Christian Bibles were grouped together as twenty-two books, equaling the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. This canon of Jewish scripture is attested to by Philo, Josephus, the New Testament,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Luke|11:51}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:44}}</ref> and the Talmud.<ref name="Stagg" />

The New Testament writers assumed the inspiration of the Old Testament, probably earliest stated in {{Bibleref2|2Tim|3:16 || 2 Timothy 3:16}}, "all Scripture is inspired of God."<ref name="Stagg" />

=== Old and New Testaments ===
{{main|Development of the Old Testament canon|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The Old Testament canon entered into Christian use in the Greek Septuagint translations and original books, and their differing lists of texts. In addition to the Septuagint, Christianity subsequently added various writings that would become the New Testament. Somewhat different lists of accepted works continued to develop in antiquity. In the fourth century a series of [[synod]]s produced a list of texts equal to the 39-to-46-book canon of the Old Testament and to the 27-book canon of the New Testament that would be subsequently used to today, most notably the [[Synod of Hippo]] in AD 393. Also ''c''. 400, [[Jerome]] produced a definitive Latin edition of the Bible (see [[Vulgate]]), the canon of which, at the insistence of the Pope, was in accord with the earlier Synods. With the benefit of hindsight it can be said that this process effectively set the New Testament canon, although there are examples of other canonical lists in use after this time. A definitive list did not come from an [[Ecumenical Council]] until the [[Council of Trent]] (1545<U+2013>63).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Canon of the New Testament]: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the Tridentine Council."</ref>

During the [[Protestant Reformation]], certain reformers proposed different canonical lists than what was currently in use. Though not without debate, see [[Antilegomena]], the list of New Testament books would come to remain the same; however, the Old Testament texts present in the Septuagint, but not included in the Jewish canon, fell out of favor. In time they would come to be removed from most Protestant canons. Hence, in a Catholic context these texts are referred to as deuterocanonical books, whereas in a Protestant context they are referred to as Apocrypha, the label applied to all texts excluded from the biblical canon which were in the Septuagint. It should also be noted, that Catholics and Protestants both describe certain other books, such as the [[Acts of Peter]], as [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]].

Thus, the Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon<U+2014>the number varies from that of the books in the Tanakh (though not in content) because of a different method of division<U+2014>while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books as part of the canonical Old Testament. The term "Hebrew Scriptures" is only synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, not the Catholic, which contains the Hebrew Scriptures and additional texts. Both Catholics and Protestants have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.

=== Qumran Bible ===
The Bible used at [[Qumran]] excluded [[Book of Esther|Esther]] but included [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]. Otherwise, it seems to have been basically the same as the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, albeit with many textual variants.

=== Ethiopian Orthodox canon ===

The Canon of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] is wider than for most other Christian groups. The Ethiopian Old Testament Canon includes the books found in the [[Septuagint]] accepted by other Orthodox Christians, in addition to [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]] and [[Jubilees]] which are ancient Jewish books that only survived in Ge'ez but are quoted in the New Testament (citation required), also Greek Ezra [[1 Esdras|First]] and the [[Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra|Apocalypse of Ezra]], 3 books of [[Meqabyan]], and [[Psalm 151]] at the end of the Psalter. The three books of Meqabyan are not be confused with the books of Maccabees. The order of the other books is somewhat different from other groups', as well. The Old Testament follows the Septuagint order for the Minor Prophets rather than the Jewish order.

=== Marcionite Bible ===

[[Marcion]], an early Christian [[Christian heresy|heretic]], and his followers, had a Bible that excluded the Old Testament. It consisted of an edited [[Gospel of Luke]] (excluding what Marcion considered Jewish additions), and the [[Epistles of Paul]] (excluding [[Titus]], the two epistles to Timothy, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], and passages rejected as Jewish additions).<ref>Paula Fredriksen, ''Augustine and the Jews'', ISBN 978-0-385-50270-2 (2008), pp. 67-68, 391.</ref>

== Bible versions and translations ==
{{see|Bible translations|Bible translations by language}}

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], [[Wiltshire, England]]. This Bible was transcribed in [[Belgium]] in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
Bible versions are discussed below, while [[Bible translations]] can be found on a separate page.

The original texts of the Tanakh were in Hebrew, although some portions were in Aramaic. In addition to the authoritative Masoretic Text, Jews still refer to the Septuagint, the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, and the [[Targum Onkelos]], an Aramaic version of the Bible. There are several different ancient versions of the Tanakh in Hebrew, mostly differing by spelling, and the traditional Jewish version is based on the version known as [[Aleppo Codex]]. Even in this version by itself, there are words which are traditionally read differently from written (sometimes one word is written and another is read), because the oral tradition is considered more fundamental than the written one, and presumably mistakes had been made in copying the text over the generations.

The primary biblical text for early Christians was the [[Septuagint|Septuagint or (LXX)]]. In addition, they translated the Hebrew Bible into several other languages. Translations were made into Syriac, [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and Latin, among other languages. The Latin translations were historically the most important for the Church in the West, while the Greek-speaking East continued to use the Septuagint translations of the Old Testament and had no need to translate the New Testament.

The earliest Latin translation was the Old Latin text, or [[Vetus Latina]], which, from internal evidence, seems to have been made by several authors over a period of time. It was based on the Septuagint, and thus included books not in the Hebrew Bible.

[[Pope Damasus I]] assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the [[Council of Rome]] in AD 382. He commissioned Saint [[Jerome]] to produce a reliable and consistent text by translating the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin. This translation became known as the [[Vulgate|Latin Vulgate Bible]] and in 1546 at the [[Council of Trent]] was declared by the Church to be the only authentic and official Bible in the [[Latin Rite]].

Especially since the [[Protestant Reformation]], [[Bible translations]] for many languages have been made. The Bible has seen a notably large number of [[English translations of the Bible|English language translations]].

== Biblical criticism ==
{{main|Biblical criticism|Criticism of the Bible}}

[[Biblical criticism]] refers to the investigation of the Bible as a text, and addresses questions such as authorship, dates of composition, and authorial intention. It is not the same as [[criticism of the Bible]], which is an assertion against the Bible being a source of information or ethical guidance.

=== Higher criticism ===
{{main|Higher criticism|Lower criticism}}

The traditional view of the Mosaic authorship of the Torah came under sporadic criticism from medieval scholars including Isaac ibn Yashush, [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], Bonfils of Damascus and bishop [[Tostatus]] of Avila{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}, who pointed to passages such as the description of the death of Moses in Deuteronomy as evidence that some portions, at least, could not have been written by Moses.

In the 17th century [[Thomas Hobbes]] collected the current evidence and became the first scholar{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} to conclude outright that Moses could not have written the bulk of the Torah. Shortly afterwards the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] published a unified critical analysis, arguing that the problematic passages were not isolated cases that could be explained away one by one, but pervasive throughout the five books, concluding that it was "clearer than the sun at noon that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses...." Despite determined opposition from Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, the views of Hobbes and Spinoza gained increasing acceptance amongst scholars.

=== Documentary hypothesis ===
{{main|Documentary hypothesis}}

Scholars intrigued by the hypothesis that Moses had not written the Pentateuch considered other authors. Independent but nearly simultaneous proposals by H. B. Witter, [[Jean Astruc]], and [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]] separated the Pentateuch into two original documentary components, both dating from after the time of Moses. Others hypothesized the presence of two additional sources. The four documents were given working titles: J ([[Jahwist]]/Yahwist), E ([[Elohist]]), P ([[Priestly source|Priestly]]), and D ([[Deuteronomist]]). Each was discernible by its own characteristic language, and each, when read in isolation, presented a unified, coherent narrative.

Subsequent [[Higher criticism|scholars]], notably Eduard Reuss, [[Karl Heinrich Graf]] and Wilhelm Vatke, turned their attention to the order in which the documents had been composed (which they deduced from internal clues) and placed them in the context of a theory of the development of ancient Israelite religion, suggesting that much of the Laws and the narrative of the Pentateuch were unknown to the Israelites in the time of Moses. These were synthesized by [[Julius Wellhausen]] (1844<U+2013>1918), who suggested a historical framework for the composition of the documents and their redaction (combination) into the final document known as the Pentateuch. This hypothesis was challenged by [[William Henry Green]] in his ''The Mosaic Origins of the Pentateuchal Codes'' ([http://www.biblicaltheology.org/mop.html available online]). Nonetheless, according to contemporary Torah scholar [[Richard Elliott Friedman]], Wellhausen's model of the [[documentary hypothesis]] continues to dominate the field of biblical scholarship: "To this day, if you want to disagree, you disagree with Wellhausen. If you want to pose a new model, you compare its merits with those of Wellhausen's model."<ref>Richard Elliott Friedman, "Who Wrote the Bible?," HarperSanFrancisco, 1997 (2nd edition).</ref>

The documentary hypothesis is important in the field of biblical studies not only because it claims that the Torah was written by different people at different times<U+2014>generally long after the events it describes<U+2014><ref>Joel Rosenberg, 1984 "The Bible: Biblical Narrative" in Barry Holtz, ed ''Back to the Sources'' New York: Summit Books p. 36; Nahum Sarna, 1986 ''Understanding Genesis'' New York:Schocken Books pp. xxi-xxiii.</ref> but it also proposed what was at the time a radically new way of reading the Bible. Many proponents of the documentary hypothesis view the Bible more as a body of literature than a work of history, believing that the historical value of the text lies not in its account of the events that it describes, but in what critics can infer about the times in which the authors lived (as critics may read ''[[Hamlet]]'' to learn about seventeenth-century England, but will not read it to learn about seventh-century Denmark).

=== Modern developments ===

The critical analysis of authorship now encompasses every book of the Bible. In some cases the traditional view on authorship has been overturned; in others, additional support, at least in part, has been found.

The development of the hypothesis has not stopped with Wellhausen. Wellhausen's hypothesis, for example, proposed that the four documents were composed in the order J-E-D-P, with P, containing the bulk of the Jewish law, dating from the post-Exilic [[Second Temple]] period (i.e., after 515 BC);<ref>Wellhausen adopted the idea of a post-Exilic date for P from [[Edouard Guillaume Eug<U+00E8>ne Reuss|Eduard Reuss]].</ref> but the contemporary view is that P is earlier than D, and that all four books date from the [[First Temple]] period (i.e., prior to 587 BC).<ref>Although the ''bulk'' of all four documents date from before 587 BC, the strand of D known as Dtr2 dates from the following Exilic period.</ref> The documentary hypothesis has more recently been refined by later scholars such as [[Martin Noth]] (who in 1943 provided evidence that Deuteronomy plus the following six books make a unified history from the hand of a single editor), [[Harold Bloom]], [[Frank Moore Cross]] and [[Richard Elliot Friedman]].

The documentary hypothesis, at least in the four-document version advanced by Wellhausen, has been controversial since its formulation. The direction of this criticism is to question the existence of separate, identifiable documents, positing instead that the biblical text is made up of almost innumerable strands so interwoven as to be hardly untangleable<U+2014>the J document, in particular, has been subjected to such intense dissection that it seems in danger of disappearing.

Although [[biblical archaeology]] has confirmed the existence of many people, places, and events mentioned in the Bible, many critical scholars have argued that the Bible be read not as an accurate historical document, but rather as a work of literature and theology that often draws on historical events<U+2014>as well as upon non-Hebrew mythology<U+2014>as primary source material (see [[The Bible and history]]). For these scholars, the Bible reveals much about the lives and times of its authors and compilers.

== Archaeological and historical research ==
{{main|Biblical archaeology school|The Bible and history}}

Biblical archaeology is the [[archaeology]] that relates to, and sheds light upon, the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. It is used to help determine the lifestyle and practices of people living in biblical times.

There are a wide range of interpretations of the existing Biblical archaeology. One broad division includes [[Biblical maximalism]] that generally take the view that most of the Old Testament or [[Hebrew Bible]] is essentially based on history although presented through the religious viewpoint of its time. It is considered the opposite of [[Biblical Minimalism|biblical minimalism]] which is strictly secular and does not allow any consideration of the Bible as documentary evidence or as a framework of history.

One example of the dispute involves biblical accounts of [[Book of Exodus#Bondage in Egypt|Israelite bondage in Egypt]], wandering in the desert, and conquest the [[Land of Israel]] in a military campaign, the accounts of the [[Land of Israel|land]] being passed on to the [[Israelites|12 tribes of Israel]], and [[King David|David]]'s and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]'s conquests, and other key elements described in the biblical narratives as occurring in the 10th century BC or before. So far, there is a lack of archaeological evidence to independently support this, which has led some archaeologists, such as [[Israel Finkelstein]], [[Neil Silberman]],<ref>{{cite book
| last = Finkelstein| first = Israel

| title = The Bible Unearthed

| last = Dever
| first = William
| authorlink = William Dever
| title = Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come from?
| publisher =

| Isbn = }}</ref> to believe that these events never happened, and that the ancestors of the [[Hebrews]] and the [[Jews]] are either nomads who had become sedentary, or people from the plains of [[Canaan]], who fled to the highlands to escape the control of the cities. Others disagree sharply.<ref>{{cite web

| title = Nomadic Jews, Never
| Accessdate = | author = | last = Kurinsky | first = Samuel
| Date = | year = 2008 | month = August
| Work = | publisher = Hebrew History Foundation}}</ref>

Another example involves the story of [[Noah's Ark]]. [[Biblical literalism|Biblical literalists]] support a theory of a worldwide flood as described in the story and are looking for archaeological evidence in the region of the [[mountains of Ararat]] in north-east [[Turkey]] where Genesis says Noah's Ark came to rest. Mainstream scientists (and many Christians and Jews) discount a literal interpretation of the Ark story, on the basis of [[history of geology|geology]] and other sciences.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3524676.stm Did Noah really build an ark?, BBC].</ref>

According to recent theories, linguistic as well as archaeological, the global structure of the texts in the [[Hebrew Bible]] were compiled during the reign of King [[Josiah]] in the 7th century BC. Even though the components are derived from more ancient writings, the final form of the books is believed to have been set somewhere between the 1st century BC and the 4th century AD.
