"'''Mr. Tambourine Man'''" is a song written and performed by [[Bob Dylan]] and featured on his 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', [[Record producer|produced]] by [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] (''see'' [[1965 in music]]). [[The Byrds]] also recorded a version that was their first [[Single (music)|single]] on [[Columbia Records]] and the title track of their first album, and which reached #1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the [[UK Singles Chart]].  The Byrds had access to a recording of the song by Dylan and [[Ramblin' Jack Elliot]], from when Dylan attempted to record it during the [[Studio recording|session]] for his ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' album, before it was released on ''Bringing It All Back Home''. As a result, The Byrds were able to release their own version just two weeks after Dylan's.  The Byrds' recording of the song was influential in initiating the musical subgenre of [[folk rock]], leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single's success.  

The song has also been covered by many other artists, including [[Judy Collins]], [[Odetta]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], and [[William Shatner]].  The song's popularity led to Dylan recording it live many times, and it has been included in multiple Dylan and Byrds compilation albums.  It has been translated into several languages, and has also been used in television shows and films, and referenced in several books.

The song has a bright, expansive melody and has become famous in particular for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and Italian filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]].  The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a paean to drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], a call to the singer's [[muse]], a reflection of the audience's demands on the singer, and even religious interpretations.  Dylan sings the song in four verses, but only one of these was recorded by The Byrds.  The song is one of just three that was included twice in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]], since both The Byrds' version and Dylan's own version are included.  Both versions also received [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]s.

===Composition and recording===
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was written in early 1964, about the same time as "[[Chimes of Freedom]]", which Dylan recorded later that spring for his last acoustic album, ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]''.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=rough>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan|edition=2nd edition|author=Williamson, N.|pages=223<U+2013>224|year=2006|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-1-84353-718-2}}</ref> Dylan began writing "Mr. Tambourine Man" in February 1964, after partying in [[New Orleans]] during [[Mardi Gras]] while on a cross-country road trip with several friends, completing it sometime between mid-March and late April after returning to New York.<ref name=heylin/>  Journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] claimed that Dylan completed the song at his home but [[folk music|folk singer]] [[Judy Collins]] (who later covered the song) has also claimed that Dylan completed the song at her home.<ref name=heylin/>  Dylan premiered the song the following month during a visit to England in what is considered one of the landmark concerts of the 1960s, his solo May 17 appearance at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]].<ref name=heylin/>

Dylan first recorded "Mr. Tambourine Man" a few weeks later, on June 9, with Tom Wilson [[Record producer|producing]], during the ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' session.<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{cite book|author=Heylin, C.|year=1995|title=Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions (1960&ndash;1994)|page=29|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=0-312-15067-9)}}</ref>  The [[Take#Music|take]], recorded with [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], was cut from the album because Dylan felt the song was special and their performance did not do it justice.<ref name=heylin/>  More than six months passed before Dylan re-recorded the song, again with Tom Wilson in the [[Record producer|producer]]'s chair, during the final ''Bringing It All Back Home'' session on January 15, 1965, the same day as "[[Gates of Eden]]", "[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]", and "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]" were recorded.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades|author=Heylin, C.|pages=104-106|year=2002|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060525699}}</ref><ref name=heylin/>  It was long thought that the four songs were all recorded in one long take.<ref name=albums>{{cite book|title=The Bob Dylan Albums|author=Varesi, A.|pages=51<U+2013>53|year=2002|publisher=Guernica|isbn=1-55071-139-3}}</ref> However, in the biography ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades'', Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts, possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan's [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[Bruce Langhorne]]'s electric lead.<ref name=heylin/> The final take was selected for the album which was released on March 22, 1965.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=albums/>  

The song has a bright, expansive melody,<ref name=keys/> with Langhorne's electric guitar accompaniment, which provides a countermelody to the vocals, being the only instrument besides Dylan's acoustic guitar.<ref name=gill/>  Dylan plays a [[harmonica]] solo that evokes the narrator's internal daydream.<ref name=keys/>  Unusually, rather than beginning with the first verse, the song begins with an iteration of the chorus:<ref name=keys/>  

:''Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
:''I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
:''Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

The four verses expand on the narrator's situation using heavily embroidered imagery.<ref name=keys/><ref name=allmusic1/>  Though weary, the narrator is unable to sleep and wants to hear Mr. Tambourine Man's song, believing that the song will fulfill his desire to be set free.<ref name=allmusic1>{{cite web|title=Mr. Tambourine Man|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:ajftxzlrldae|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=July 16, 2009}}</ref>  

There has always been speculation that the song is about drugs such as  [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] or [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], particularly with lines such as "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship" and "the smoke rings of my mind."<ref name=heylin/><ref name=rough/><ref name=gill/>  However, Dylan always denied the song is about drugs, and though he was using marijuana at the time the song was written, he was not introduced to LSD until a few months later.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=rough/>  Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or [[muse]], or the singer's search for transcendence.<ref name=rough/><ref name=hinchey>{{cite book|title=Like a Complete Unknown|author=Hinchey, J.|pages=94<U+2013>99|year=2002|publisher=Stealing Home Press|isbn=0-9723592-0-6}}</ref><ref name=williams1>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan Performing Artist: The Early Years 1960<U+2013>1973|author=Williams, P.|pages=128<U+2013>133|year=1990|publisher=Underwood-Miller|isbn=0-88733-131-9}}</ref><ref name=shelton>{{cite book|title=No Direction Home|author=Shelton, R.|pages=274<U+2013>275|year=1997|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80782-3}}</ref>  The singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; ironically the song itself is evidence that the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration.<ref name=hinchey/><ref name=shelton/>  Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for [[Jesus Christ]] and for the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].<ref name=allmusic1/>  The song may also reference [[gospel music]], with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.<ref name=shelton/>

Dylan cited the influence of [[Federico Fellini]]'s movie [[La strada]] on the song,<ref name=keys>{{cite book|title=Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia|author=Trager, O.|pages=438<U+2013>441|year=2004|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0823079742}}</ref><ref name=sounes>{{cite book|author=Sounes, H.|title=Down the Highway: The Life Of Bob Dylan|page=182|publisher=Doubleday|year=2001|isbn=0-552-99929-6}}</ref> while other commentators found echoes of the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan|editor=Dettmar, K.|chapter=Bringing It All Back Home|author=Tamarin, J.|page=135|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-521-88694-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades|author=Heylin, C.|page=151|year=2002|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060525699}}</ref>  The lyrics "in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you" are taken from a [[Lord Buckley]] recording.<ref name=sounes/>  In addition to providing the electric guitar accompaniment for the song, Dylan has said that [[Bruce Langhorne]] was the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song.<ref name=keys/>  Langhorne used to play a giant, four-inch-deep Turkish tambourine, and had brought it to a previous Dylan recording session.<ref name=heylin>{{cite book|title=Revolution in the Air|author=Heylin, C.|pages=181<U+2013>186|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-843-9}}</ref><ref name=gill>{{cite book|title=Don't Think Twice, It's All Right|author=Gill, A.|pages=74<U+2013>75|year=1998|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1-56025-185-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Richie Unterberger Interviews Bruce Langhorne, Part 2|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/langhorne2.html|publisher=Richie Unterberger|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Richie Unterberger Interviews Bruce Langhorne, Part 1|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/langhorne.html|publisher=Richie Unterberger|accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref>

===Release and the birth of folk rock===
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was the debut single by the American [[folk rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] The Byrds, released on April 12, 1965, by Columbia Records.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eder, B.|year=1990|title=The Byrds 1990 CD box set liner notes}}</ref>  The song was included on the band's debut album, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]]'', released on June 21, 1965.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|page=545|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The single, along with the album of the same name, was influential in originating the musical style known as folk rock, with the single becoming the first folk rock smash hit.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|year=1996|title=Mr. Tambourine Man (1996 CD liner notes)}}</ref><ref name=allbyrds/>  Indeed, the term "folk rock" was first coined by the U.S [[Music journalism|music press]] to describe the band's sound at the same time as "Mr. Tambourine Man" peaked at #1 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|pages=81-83|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref> 

The single initiated the folk rock explosion of 1965 and 1966, with many acts imitating the band's hybrid of a rock beat, jangly guitar playing and poetic or socially conscious lyrics.<ref name=allmusic1/><ref name=folkrock>{{cite web|title=Folk Rock Overview|publisher=[[allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=77:417|accessdate=November 3, 2009}}</ref>  This hybrid had its antecedents in the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] of the early 1960s, [[The Animals]]' recording of "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]", the folk-influenced songwriting of [[The Beau Brummels]], and the [[twelve-string guitar]] jangle of [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]] and [[The Beatles]].<ref name=allbyrds/><ref name=unterberger>{{cite web|title=Folk Rock: An Overview|publisher=Richieunterberger.com|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/turnover.html|accessdate=November 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Burt, R and North, P.|page=28|year=1977|title=West Coast Story: The 60's Rock Revolution|publisher=Phoebus Publishing Company|isbn=0-600-39393-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Wadhams, W.|page=194|year=2001|title=Inside The Hits: The Seduction Of A Rock And Roll Generation|publisher=Berklee Press|isbn=0-634-01430-7}}</ref>  However, it was The Byrds who first melded these disparate elements into a unified whole, creating the template for folk rock heard around the globe during the mid-1960s.<ref name=unterberger/>  Although Dylan's recording of "Mr. Tambourine Man" was not itself a direct influence on the genre, his recordings with an electric rock backing on the albums ''Bringing It All Back Home'' and ''Highway 61 Revisited'' certainly were.<ref name=unterberger/>

The master take of "Mr. Tambourine Man" was recorded on January 20, 1965, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, prior to the release of Dylan's own version.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, C.|page=24|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-90600-215-0}}</ref>  The song's jangling, melodic guitar playing (played by McGuinn on a [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]] [[Rickenbacker]] guitar) was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day.<ref name="timeless2"/>  The group's complex [[Vocal harmony|harmony]] work, as featured on "Mr. Tambourine Man", became another major characteristic of their sound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Tambourine Man|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to The Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpmtm.html|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}</ref>  Due to producer [[Terry Melcher]]'s initial lack of confidence in The Byrds' musicianship, McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on "Mr. Tambourine Man" and its [[A-Side and B-Side|B-side]], "I Knew I'd Want You".<ref name="timeless2"/> Rather than using band members, Melcher hired [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], a collection of top L.A. [[session musician]]s, who (with McGuinn on guitar) provided the backing track over which McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark sang.<ref name="David Fricke">{{cite book|author=Fricke, D.|year=1996|title=Mr. Tambourine Man (1996 CD liner notes)}}</ref> By the time the sessions for their debut album began in March 1965, however, Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing.<ref name=allbyrds>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifqxqw5ldfe~T1|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> 

The Byrds' recording of the song opens with McGuinn's distinctive, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]-inspired guitar [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's [[Refrain|chorus]].<ref name="timeless2"/>  Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse, before repeating the chorus, followed by a variation on the song's introduction which then [[Fade (audio engineering)|fades out]].<ref name=allmusic1/>  The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during rehearsals at World Pacific in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial [[radio]] stations which did not want to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long.<ref name=creswell>{{cite book|title=1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets Behind Them|author=[[Toby Creswell|Creswell, Toby]]|page=59|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-1560259152}}</ref><ref name="timeless2"/>  Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes.<ref name=allmusic1/>  The [[lead vocal]] on The Byrds' version of "Mr. Tambourine Man" was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of [[John Lennon]] and Bob Dylan.<ref name="timeless2"/>  The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer, [[Johnny Rogan]], in 1997: "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission."<ref name="timeless2"/>
