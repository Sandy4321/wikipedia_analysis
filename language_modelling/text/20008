An '''abortion''' is the removal or expulsion of an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] from the [[uterus]], resulting in or caused by its death. This can occur spontaneously as a [[miscarriage]], or be artificially induced by [[chemistry|chemical]], [[surgery|surgical]] or other means. Commonly, "abortion" refers to an induced procedure at any point during [[pregnancy]]; medically, it is defined as miscarriage or induced termination before twenty weeks' [[gestation]], which is considered [[Viability|nonviable]].

Throughout [[History of abortion|history]], abortion has been induced by various methods. The [[Ethical aspects of abortion|moral]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] aspects of abortion are subject to intense [[Abortion debate|debate]] in many parts of the world. 
<!--Note to editors: This article has a long and intense history of terminology debates. Please review the talk page before making changes to lines to see if there is a previous established consensus or compromise. Thank you.-->

==Definitions==
The following medical terms are used to categorize abortion:
* ''Spontaneous abortion ([[miscarriage]])'': An abortion due to accidental trauma or [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]]. Most miscarriages are due to incorrect replication of chromosomes; they can also be caused by environmental factors.
*''Induced abortion'': Abortion that has been deliberately induced. Induced abortions are further subcategorized into therapeutic and elective: 
**''Therapeutic abortion:''<ref>Roche, Natalie E. (2004). [http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3311.htm Therapeutic Abortion]. Retrieved [[2006-03-08]].</ref>
*** To save the life of the pregnant woman.    
*** To preserve the woman's physical or mental health. 
*** To terminate pregnancy that would result in a child born with a [[congenital disorder]] that would be [[fatal]] or associated with significant [[morbidity]]. 
*** To [[selective reduction|selectively reduce]] the number of [[fetus]]es to lessen health risks associated with  [[multiple birth|multiple pregnancy]].
**''Elective abortion'': Abortion performed for any other reason.

In common parlance, the term "abortion" is synonymous with induced abortion. However, in medical texts, the word 'abortion' might exclusively refer to, or may also refer to, ''spontaneous abortion'' (miscarriage).

==Incidence==
The incidence of, and reasons for induced abortion vary regionally. It has been estimated that yearly, approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide. Of these, 26 million are said to occur in [[abortion law|places where abortion is legal]]; the other 20 million happen where it is illegal. Some countries, such as [[Belgium]] (11.2 per 100 known pregnancies) and the [[Netherlands]] (10.6 per 100), have a low rate of induced abortion, while others like [[Russia]] (62.6 per 100) and [[Vietnam]] (43.7 per 100) have a comparatively high rate. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies.<ref>Henshaw, Stanley K., Singh, Susheela, & Haas, Taylor. (1999).

Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures.  These might include the stigmatization of [[disabled]] persons, preference for children of a specific [[sex]], disapproval of [[single parent|single motherhood]], insufficient economic support for [[family|families]], lack of access to or rejection of contraceptive methods, or efforts toward [[population control]] (such as [[People's Republic of China|China]]'s [[one-child policy]]). These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]]. In many areas, especially in [[developing country|developing nations]] or where abortion is illegal, women sometimes resort to "[[back-alley abortion|back-alley]]" or [[self-induced abortion|self-induced]] procedures.

==Forms of abortion==
===Spontaneous abortion===
{{main|Miscarriage}}

<!--improve me!-->
Spontaneous abortions, generally referred to as miscarriages, occur when an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] is lost due to natural causes before the 20th week of [[fetal development|development]]. A pregnancy that ends earlier than 37 weeks of [[gestation]], if it results in a [[Live birth|live-born]] [[infant]], is known as a "[[premature birth]]". When a fetus dies in the uterus at some point late in gestation, beginning at about 20 weeks, or during [[childbirth|delivery]], it is termed a "[[stillbirth]]". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap.

Most miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy. Between 10% and 50% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman.<ref>"[http://wuphysicians.wustl.edu/dept.asp?pageID=8&ID=35 Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility: Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (Recurrent Miscarriage)]." (n.d.) Retrieved [[2006-01-18]] from Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology web site.</ref> In most cases, they occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant.

The risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 8th week.<ref> -[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2176898.stm Q&A: Miscarriage]. (August 6 , 2002). ''BBC News.'' Retrieved January 10, 2007. <br>- [[Lennart Nilsson]]. (1990) ''A Child is Born.'' </ref> This risk is greater in those with a known history of several spontaneous abortions or an induced abortion, those with systemic diseases, and those over age 35.  Other causes can be infection (of either the woman or fetus), immune response, or serious systemic disease. A spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental [[Physical trauma|trauma]]; intentional trauma to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion or [[feticide]].

===Induced abortion===
A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in many ways. The manner selected depends chiefly upon the [[gestational age]] of the [[fetus]], in addition to the legality, regional availability, and doctor-patient preference for specific procedures. 

====Surgical abortion====
[[Image:Abortionmethods.png|thumb|380px|right|[[Gestational age]] may determine which abortion methods are practiced.]]
In the first twelve weeks, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or vacuum abortion is the most common method.<ref>Healthwise. [http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion]. (2004). ''WebMD.'' Retrieved [[2006-08-19]].</ref>   ''[[Manual vacuum aspiration]]'', or MVA abortion, consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]] by suction using a manual [[syringe]], while the ''[[Electric vacuum aspiration]]'' or EVA abortion method uses an electric [[pump]]. These techniques are comparable, differing in the mechanism used to apply suction, how early in pregnancy they can be used, and whether cervical dilation is necessary. MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and [[menstrual extraction]], can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation.  Surgical techniques are sometimes referred to as ''STOP'': 'Suction (or surgical) Termination Of Pregnancy'. From the fifteenth week until approximately the twenty-sixth week, a [[dilation and evacuation]] (D & E) is used. D & E consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the [[uterus]] and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.

''[[Dilation and curettage]]'' (D & C) is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion.  ''[[Curettage]]'' refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called Sharp Curettage, only when MVA is unavailable.<ref>World Health Organization. (2003). [http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors]. Retrieved [[2006-08-19]].</ref>  Sharp curettage only accounted for 2.4% of abortion procedures in the US in 2002.<ref name="cdc2002" /> The term "D and C", or sometimes ''suction curette'', is used as a euphemism for the first trimester abortion procedure, whichever the method used. 

Other techniques must be used to induce abortion in the third [[trimester]]. Premature delivery can be induced with [[prostaglandin]]; this can be coupled with injecting the [[amniotic sac|amniotic fluid]] with caustic solutions containing [[saline (medicine)|saline]] or [[urea]]. Very late abortions can be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (intact D & X) (also called [[Intrauterine cranial decompression]]), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation, and is sometimes termed "[[partial-birth abortion]]."  A [[hysterotomy abortion]], similar to a [[caesarian section]] but resulting in a terminated fetus, can also be used at late stages of pregnancy. It can be performed vaginally, with an incision just above the [[cervix]], in the late mid-trimester.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

From the 20th to 23rd week of gestation, an [[medical injection|injection]] to stop the fetal heart can be used as the first phase of the surgical abortion procedure.<ref>-Vause S, Sands J, Johnston TA, Russell S, Rimmer S.

====Medical abortion====
{{main|Medical abortion}}

Effective in the first trimester of pregnancy, medical (sometimes called ''chemical abortion''), or non-surgical abortions comprise 10% of all abortions in the [[United States]] and Europe. Combined regimens include [[methotrexate]] or [[mifepristone]], followed by a [[prostaglandin]] (either [[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]: misoprostol is used in the U.S.; gemeprost is used in the UK and Sweden.) When used within 49 days gestation, approximately 92% of women undergoing medical abortion with a combined regimen experience completed it without surgical intervention.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Spitz, I.M. et al|title=Early pregnancy termination with mifepristone and misoprostol in the United States|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|year=1998|volume=338|issue=18|id=PMID 9562577}}</ref>  Misoprostol can be used alone, but has a lower efficacy rate than combined regimens.  In cases of failure of medical abortion, vacuum or manual aspiration is used to complete the abortion surgically.

Assessing the risks of induced abortion depends on a number of factors. First, there are relative health risks of induced abortion and pregnancy, which are both affected by wide variation in the quality of health services in different [[Society|societies]] and among different [[socio-economic]] groups, a lack of uniform [[definition]]s of terms, and difficulties in patient follow-up and after-care. The degree of risk is also dependent upon the skill and experience of the practitioner; maternal age, health, and [[Parity (medicine)|parity]];<ref name="bartley" /> [[gestational age]];<ref name="bartley" /><ref name="pauli" /> pre-existing conditions; methods and instruments used; [[medication]]s used; the skill and experience of those assisting the practitioner; and the quality of recovery and follow-up care.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the number of deaths directly due to legal abortion between the years of 1991 and 1993 was 5, compared to 3 deaths following spontaneous miscarriage and 8 deaths caused by [[ectopic pregnancy]] during the same time frame.<ref>Department of Health. (1998). ''[http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/wmd/wmd-hm.htm Why Mothers Die: Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom 1994<U+2013>1996].'' London: The Stationery Office. Retrieved [[2006-01-11]].</ref> In the [[United States]], during the year 1999, there were 4 deaths due to legal abortion, 10 due to [[miscarriage]], and 525 due to pregnancy-related reasons.<ref>Elam-Evans, Laurie.

Some practitioners advocate using minimal [[anaesthesia]] so the patient can alert them to possible complications. Others recommend [[general anaesthesia]], to prevent patient movement, which might cause a perforation. General anaesthesia carries its own risks, including death, which is why public health officials recommend against its routine use.

[[Dilation]] of the [[cervix]] carries the risk of cervical tears or perforations, including small tears that might not be apparent and might cause [[cervical incompetence]] in future pregnancies. Most practitioners recommend using the smallest possible dilators, and using [[osmotic]] rather than [[Machine|mechanical]] dilators after the first [[trimester]]. 

Instruments that are placed within the uterus can, on rare occasions, cause [[perforation]]<ref name="pauli" /> or [[laceration]] of the uterus, and damage structures surrounding the uterus. Laceration or perforation of the uterus or cervix can, again on rare occasions, lead to more serious complications.

Incomplete emptying of the uterus can cause [[hemorrhage]] and infection. Use of [[Medical_ultrasonography|ultrasound]] verification of the location and duration of the pregnancy prior to abortion, with immediate follow-up of patients reporting continuing pregnancy symptoms after the procedure, will virtually eliminate this risk. The sooner a complication is noted and properly treated, the lower the risk of permanent injury or death. 

In rare cases, abortion will be unsuccessful and pregnancy will continue. An unsuccessful abortion can result in delivery of a live [[neonate]], or infant. This, termed a failed abortion, is very rare and can only occur late in pregnancy. Some doctors have voiced concerns about the ethical and legal ramifications of letting the neonate die. As a result, recent investigations have been launched in the [[United Kingdom]] by the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) and the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]], in order to determine how widespread the problem is and what an ethical response in the treatment of the infant might be.<ref>Rogers, Lois.

[[#unsafe abortion|Unsafe abortion]] methods (e.g. use of certain drugs, herbs, or insertion of non-surgical objects into the [[uterus]]) are potentially dangerous, carrying a significantly elevated risk for permanent injury or death, as compared to abortions done by [[physician]]s.

===Suggested effects===
There is controversy over a number of proposed risks and effects of abortion. Evidence, whether in support of or against such claims, might be influenced by the political and religious beliefs of the parties behind it.

====Breast cancer====
{{main|Abortion-breast cancer hypothesis|Breast cancer}}

The abortion-breast cancer (ABC) hypothesis (also referred to by supporters as the ABC link) posits a [[causality|causal relationship]] between induced abortion and an increased risk of developing [[breast cancer]].  In early [[pregnancy]] the level of [[estrogen]]s increases, leading to [[breast]] [[cellular differentiation|growth]] in preparation for [[lactation]]. The abortion-breast cancer hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted with an abortion &ndash; before full differentiation in the third [[trimester]] &ndash; then more relatively vulnerable undifferentiated cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer.

==Social issues==

A number of complex issues exist in the debate over abortion. These, like the suggested effects upon health listed above, are a focus of research and a fixture of discussion among members on all sides of the controversy.

===Effect upon crime rate===
{{Main|Legalized abortion and crime effect}}

A controversial theory attempts to draw a [[correlation]] between the United States' unprecedented nationwide decline of the overall [[crime rate]] during the 1990s and the decriminalization of abortion 20 years prior.

The suggestion was brought to widespread attention by a 1999 [[academic paper]], ''[[The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime]]'', authored by the [[economist]]s [[Steven Levitt|Steven D. Levitt]] and John Donohue. They attributed the drop in crime to a reduction in individuals said to have a higher statistical probability of committing crimes: unwanted children, especially those born to mothers who are [[African-American]], [[poverty|impoverished]], [[teenage pregnancy|adolescent]], [[education|uneducated]], and [[single parent|single]]. The change coincided with what would have been the adolescence, or peak years of potential criminality, of those who had not been born as a result of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and similar cases. Donohue and Levitt's study also noted that states which legalized abortion before the rest of the nation experienced the lowering crime rate pattern earlier, and those with higher abortion rates had more pronounced reductions.<ref>Donohue, John J. and Levitt, Steven D. (2001). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=174508 The impact of legalized abortion on crime].''Quarterly Journal of Economics'' Retrieved [[2006-02-11]]. </ref>  

Fellow economists Christopher Foote and Christopher Goetz criticized the [[methodology]] in the Donohue-Levitt study, noting a lack of accommodation for statewide yearly variations such as [[cocaine]] use, and recalculating based on incidence of crime [[per capita]]; they found no [[statistically significant]] results.<ref>Foote, Christopher L. and Goetz, Christopher F.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion and infanticide}}

The advent of both [[Medical_ultrasonography|sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] has allowed parents to determine [[sex]] before [[childbirth|birth]]. This has led to the occurrence of [[sex-selective abortion and infanticide|sex-selective abortion]] or the targeted termination of a [[fetus]] based upon its sex.

It is suggested that sex-selective abortion might be partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the [[birth rate]]s of male and female children in some places. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in [[Mainland China]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], and [[India]].<ref>Banister, Judith.

Where and when access to safe abortion has been barred, due to explicit sanctions or general unavailability, women seeking to terminate their pregnancies have sometimes resorted to unsafe methods.

"[[Back-alley abortion]]" is a [[slang]] term for any abortion not practiced under generally accepted standards of [[sanitation]] and [[professional|professionalism]]. The [[World Health Organization]] defines an unsafe abortion as being, "a procedure...carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or both."<ref name="whounsafe" /> This can include a person without medical training, a professional health provider operating in sub-standard conditions, or the woman herself. 

Unsafe abortion remains a [[public health]] concern today due to the higher incidence and severity of its associated complications, such as incomplete abortion, [[sepsis]], [[hemorrhage]], and damage to internal organs. WHO estimates that 19 million unsafe abortions occur around the world annually and that 68,000 of these result in the woman's death.<ref name="whounsafe" /> Complications of unsafe abortion are said to account, globally, for approximately 13% of all [[maternal death|maternal mortalities]], with regional estimates including 12% in Asia, 25% in [[Latin America]], and 13% in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref>Salter, C., Johnson, H.B., and Hengen, N.

{{main|Abortion debate|Pro-choice|Pro-life}}
Over the course of the [[history of abortion]], induced abortion has been the source of considerable [[debate]], [[controversy]], and [[activism]]. An [[opinion|individual's position]] on the complex [[ethical]], [[moral]], [[philosophical]], [[Biology|biological]], and [[legal]] issues is often related to his or her [[value system]]. Opinions of abortion may be best described as being a combination of beliefs on its morality, and beliefs on the responsibility, ethical scope, and proper extent of [[government]]al [[authority|authorities]] in [[public policy]].  [[religion|Religious ethics]] also has an influence upon both personal opinion and the greater debate over abortion (see [[religion and abortion]]).

Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by [[advocacy|advocacy groups]] belonging to one of two camps. In the [[United States]], most often those in favor of legal prohibition of abortion describe themselves as [[pro-life]] while those against legal restrictions on abortion describe themselves as [[pro-choice]].  Both are used to indicate the central principles in arguments for and against abortion:  "Is the fetus a human being with a fundamental right to ''life''?" for pro-life advocates, and, for those who are pro-choice, "Does a woman have the right to ''choose'' whether or not to have an abortion?"

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of [[laws]] permitting or restricting abortion. Arguments on morality and legality tend to collide and combine, complicating the issue at hand.

Debate also focuses on whether the [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman should have to notify and/or have the [[consent]] of others in distinct cases: a [[minor (law)|minor]], her parents; a [[marriage|legally-married]] or [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife, her husband; or a pregnant woman, the biological father.  In a 2003 [[Gallup]] poll in the [[United States]], 72% of respondents were in favor of spousal notification, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor.<ref>The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.

===Public opinion===
{{Main|Societal attitudes towards abortion}}

A number of [[opinion poll]]s around the world have explored [[public opinion]] regarding the issue of abortion. Results have varied from poll to poll, country to country, and region to region, while varying with regard to different aspects of the issue.

A May 2005 survey examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 [[Europe|European]] countries, asking polltakers whether they agreed with the statement, "If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". The highest level of approval was 81% in the [[Czech Republic]] and the highest level of disapproval was 48% in [[Poland]].<ref>TNS Sofres. (May 2005).

In [[North America]], a December 2001 poll surveyed [[Abortion in Canada#Opinion polls|Canadian opinion on abortion]], asking [[Canada|Canadians]] in what circumstances they believe abortion should be permitted; 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should be legal in no circumstances. A similar poll in January 2006 surveyed people in the [[United States]] about [[Abortion in the United States#Public Opinion|U.S. opinion on abortion]]; 33% said that abortion should be "permitted only in cases such as rape, incest or to save the woman's life", 27% said that abortion should be "permitted in all cases", 15% that it should be "permitted, but subject to greater restrictions than it is now", 17% said that it should "only be permitted to save the woman's life", and 5% said that it should "never" be permitted.<ref>''[http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm The Polling Report].''

Before the scientific discovery that human development begins at fertilization, [[English common law]] allowed abortions to be performed before "[[quickening]]", the earliest perception of fetal movement by a woman during pregnancy, until both pre- and post-quickening abortions were criminalized by ''Lord Ellenborough's Act'' in 1803.<ref>[http://members.aol.com/abtrbng/lea.htm Lord Ellenborough<U+2019>s Act]." (1998). ''The Abortion Law Homepage.'' Retrieved February 20, 2007.</ref> In 1861, the [[British Parliament]] passed the ''[[Offences Against The Person Act 1861|Offences Against the Person Act]]'', which continued to outlaw abortion and served as a model for similar prohibitions in some other nations. <ref>United Nations Population Division. (2002). [http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion Abortion Policies: A Global Review]. Retrieved February 22, 2007.</ref> The [[Soviet Union]], with legislation in 1920, and [[Iceland]], with legislation in 1935, were two of the first countries to generally allow abortion. The second half of the 20th century saw the liberalization of abortion laws in other countries. The ''[[Abortion Act 1967]]'' allowed abortion for limited reasons in the [[United Kingdom]]. In the 1973 case, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] struck down state laws banning abortion, ruling that such laws violated an implied [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States Constitution]].  The [[Supreme Court of Canada]], similarly, in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'', discarded its criminal code regarding abortion in 1988, after ruling that such restrictions violated the security of person guaranteed to women under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.  [[Canada]] later struck down provincial regulations of abortion in the case of ''[[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)]].'' By contrast, [[Abortion in Ireland|abortion in Ireland]] was affected by the addition of an [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|amendment]] to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[Constitution of Ireland|Constitution]] in 1983 by popular [[referendum]], recognizing "the right to life of the unborn".

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural sensibilities continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to [[liberty]], and the right to [[security of person]] are major issues of [[human rights]] that are sometimes used as justification for the existence or absence of laws controlling abortion. Many countries in which abortion is legal require that certain criteria be met in order for an abortion to be obtained, often, but not always, using a [[trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality:

* In the United States, some states impose a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter requests an abortion.
* In the United Kingdom, as in some other countries, two doctors must first certify that an abortion is medically or socially necessary before it can be performed.
Other countries, in which abortion is normally illegal, will allow one to be performed in the case of [[rape]], [[incest]], or danger to the pregnant woman's life or health. A few nations ban abortion entirely: [[Abortion in Chile|Chile]], [[El Salvador]], [[Malta]], and [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], although in 2006 the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] began the free distribution of [[emergency contraception]].<ref>Ross, Jen.

Retrieved 2006-12-07. </ref> In [[Bangladesh]], abortion is illegal, but the government has long supported a network of "menstrual regulation clinics", where [[menstrual extraction]] ([[manual vacuum aspiration]]) can be performed as menstrual hygiene.<ref>{{cite web|title=Surgical Abortion: History and Overview|publisher=National Abortion Federation|accessdate=2006-09-04|url=http://www.prochoice.org/education/resources/surg_history_overview.html}}</ref>
