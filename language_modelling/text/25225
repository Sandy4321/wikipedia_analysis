'''M-63''' is a [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the US state of [[Michigan]] that runs from [[M-139 (Michigan highway)|M-139]] at [[Scottdale, Michigan|Scottdale]] through the cities of [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]] and [[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]] to [[Interstate 196|Interstate 196]]/[[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US Highway 31]] (I-196/US&nbsp;31) at exit&nbsp;7 just outside [[Hagar Shores, Michigan|Hagar Shores]]. The trunkline runs through residential areas south of St. Joseph and through the central business districts of the [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin cities]]. Further north, M-63 runs along the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline.

All of M-63's routing was part of [[U.S. Route 33|US&nbsp;33]] before that highway's truncation south of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] in 1986. A previous designation of M-63 was used farther north in [[Lake County, Michigan|Lake]] and [[Osceola County, Michigan|Osceola]] counties from 1919 until 1961. Since the current designation was created, the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) has worked on reconfiguring parts of the roadway in the early part of the 21st century. The bridge M-63 uses to cross the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] has been identified as an historic structure using a rare design. The bridge itself dates back to the late 1940s.

==Route description==
M-63 begins at the intersection of Niles, Scottdale and Miners roads southwest of St. Joseph in [[Royalton Township, Michigan|Royalton Township]]. M-139 runs on Niles Road northwest from [[Berrien Springs, Michigan|Berrien Springs]] to this point and on Scottdale Road north of the intersection. M-63 follows Miners Road west and then Niles Road northwest of the junction, parallel to the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]] through residential areas on the outskirts of the twin cities. The highway meets [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate 94]] (I-94) at the latter's exit&nbsp;27 and continues through [[St. Joseph Township, Michigan|St. Joseph Township]] to the city of St. Joseph. In the city, after Washington Avenue, Niles Road becomes Niles Avenue and turns north.<ref name=MDOT09/><ref name=google/> As part of its maintenance duties, the MDOT tracks traffic volumes on the state highways in a metric called [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a calculation of the average traffic level for any day of a year. The roadway segment along Niles Avenue north of the Napier Avenue intersection in 2009 had the highest traffic levels along all of M-63 at 22,263&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name="TMIS">{{cite web |url=http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=2008 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref>

At Main Street, Niles Avenue ends, and M-63 joins [[Interstate 94 Business (St. Joseph, Michigan)|Business Loop I-94]] (BL I-94) on Main Street into and through the downtown business district. The two highways continue together [[concurrency (road)|running concurrently]] to Ship and Port streets. These two streets form a [[one-way pair]] running east to carry BL&nbsp;I-94 to and from a separate bridge over the St. Joseph River. M-63 continues along Main Street across the river into [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]] where it follows the [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline along a short [[expressway]] segment. The trunkline exits Benton Harbor near the headquarters of the [[Whirlpool Corporation]]. North of town, the highway provides access to many lakeshore properties north of Benton Harbor at it continues northeasterly along the shoreline to the community of [[Lake Michigan Beach, Michigan|Lake Michigan Beach]]. When the highway meets Hagar Shore Road, M-63 turns east along that roadway to an interchange with [[Interstate 196|I-196]]/US&nbsp;31. The shoreline roadway continues northeast as [[A-2 (Michigan county highway)|A-2]] ([[Blue Star Highway]]) while M-63 terminates at an interchange with I-196/US&nbsp;31.<ref name=MDOT09/><ref name=google/> This northernmost segment of the highway had the lowest AADT measurement in 2009 when calculated by MDOT at 2,855&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name=TMIS/>

Various highways in the United States are listed as a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] (NHS), a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS/> M-63 has been listed as a part of the NHS from its southern terminus to the northern junction with BL&nbsp;I-94 in St. Joseph.<ref name=NHS-BHSJMI/> As the closest state highway to Lake Michigan in the area, M-63 from the southern junction with BL&nbsp;I-94 to its northern terminus has been used as a part of the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]], a tourist route that circles Lake Michigan.<ref name=MDOT09/>

==History==
===Previous designation===
M-63 originally ran from [[Peacock, Michigan|Peacock]] in [[Lake County, Michigan|Lake County]] west through [[Luther, Michigan|Luther]] to [[M-13 (Michigan highway)|M-13]] (later [[U.S. Route 131|US&nbsp;131]]) in [[Osceola County, Michigan|Osceola County]] on July 1, 1919.<ref name="MSHD19LP"/> This highway was extended in 1930 along US&nbsp;131 to [[Tustin, Michigan|Tustin]] and then to a terminus with [[M-66 (Michigan highway)|M-66]] in [[Marion, Michigan|Marion]]. At the same time, [[M-37 (Michigan highway)|M-37]] was extended north from [[Baldwin, Michigan|Baldwin]] to meet M-63 east of Peacock.<ref name="MSHD30-01"/><ref name="MSHD30-07"/> This eastern extension was truncated in 1932 when it was redesignated as part of M-61.<ref name="MSHD32-07"/><ref name="MSHD32-10"/> A short connector roadway, [[M-179 (Michigan highway)|M-179]], was designated in 1935 between M-63 and US&nbsp;131, forming a small triangle of highways.<ref name="MSHD35-09"/> The western end was shortened in 1939 so that M-63 ended at M-37 instead of continuing west to Peacock.<ref name="MSHD39-04"/><ref name="MSHD39-12"/> The M-179 designation was decommissioned in 1959 or 1960, removing that short highway from the state trunkline highway system. <ref name="MSHD60"/> M-63 was decommissioned in 1961 when the roadway was transferred back to local control. <ref name="MSHD61"/>

===Current designation===
The current designation of M-63 was created in 1986. Before the designation, US&nbsp;33 ran north into Michigan south of [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]]. From there it followed US&nbsp;31 north to [[Scottville, Michigan|Scottville]] and ran alone to St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. When US&nbsp;33 was truncated back to Niles, M-63 was commissioned in its place along the route it now follows.<ref name="MDOT86"/><ref name="MDOT87"/>

The expressway portion of M-63 is a relic of a now revised plan of a freeway corridor through the St. Joseph <U+2013> Benton Harbor area.  The highway was significantly reconfigured in 2000<U+2013>2002,<ref name="MDOT WP"/><ref name="aiken2002-06"/> with the overpass over the industrial access road to Whirlpool's warehouse in Benton Harbor and a rail line removed and rebuilt in late 2000 through early 2001,<ref name="aiken2000-11"/><ref name="aiken2001-01"/> and the only grade-separated interchange at Klock Road demolished and downgraded to an [[at-grade intersection]] in 2002.<ref name="aiken2002-07"/> Today, there are only two overpasses over smaller roads existing on this stretch of expressway.<ref name="googleX"/>

===Historic bridge===
The St. Joseph River Bridge is eligible to be listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The span is a [[bascule bridge|Scherzer rolling-lift bascule]], a type of moveable bridge. The bridge was built as part of a 1940s plan to relocate US&nbsp;31 through St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. Those plans were delayed by [[World War II]]. The bridge was completed in late 1948 using the rare design prepared by a firm from Chicago that specialized in bascule bridges. The state paid a total of $1.3&nbsp;million for what was called "the largest bridge ever built under the auspices of the State Highway Department".<ref name=sjrb>{{cite web |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154_11188-26353--,00.html |title=M-63 / St. Joseph River |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |work=Historic Bridge Listing |date= May 9, 2002 |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}</ref>
