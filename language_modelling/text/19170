The '''Itcha Range''' is a small isolated [[mountain range]] in the [[British Columbia Interior|West-Central Interior]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada. It is located {{nowrap|{{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} northeast of [[Anahim Lake, British Columbia|Anahim Lake]] on the [[Chilcotin Plateau]]. With a maximum elevation of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2375|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}, it is the lowest of three linear mountain ranges extending east from the [[Coast Mountains]]. Two mountains are named in the Itcha Range; [[Mount Downton]] and [[Itcha Mountain]]. A large [[provincial park]] surrounds the Itcha Range and other features in its vicinity. This area has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west. 

In contrast to most mountain ranges in British Columbia, the Itcha Range represents an inactive [[shield volcano]]. This highly dissected volcanic edifice consists of a variety of rock types, including [[basanite]], [[hawaiite]], [[trachyte]], [[rhyolite]], [[phonolite]] and [[alkali]] [[olivine]] [[basalt]]. They were deposited by different [[types of volcanic eruptions]] characterized by [[effusive eruption|passive lava flows]] and [[explosive eruption|explosivity]]. Two stages of eruptive activity have been identified at the volcano along with three sub-phases that are limited only to the first stage of development.

The Itcha Range is part of an east-west trending volcanic zone called the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]]. This consists of large shield volcanoes, small [[cinder cone]]s, [[lava dome]]s and lava flows that become progressively younger from west to east. The main body of the Itcha Range is between 3.8&nbsp;and 3.0&nbsp;million years old and thus over two million years ago it passed the most active shield stage of life. A long period of dormancy lasting for almost a million years followed, which was interrupted by the post-shield stage of volcanism 2.2&nbsp;to 0.8&nbsp;million years ago. More recent volcanic activity in and around the Itcha Range might have occurred in the last 340,000&nbsp;years to produce cinder cones. If volcanic eruptions were to resume at the Itcha Range, relief efforts would be quickly organized. Teams such as the [[Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan]] (IVENP) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada.

==Geography==
===Location and terrain===
The Itcha Range is situated on the northern Chilcotin Plateau, a subdivision of the [[Fraser Plateau]] which in turn is one of the main subdivisions of the large [[Interior Plateau]].<ref name="DKQ">{{cite paper|last=Shearer|first=J. T.|title=Summary Technical Report on the Clisbako Property|year=2011|page=15}}</ref><ref name="AAG">{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=Stuart S.|title=Landforms of British Columbia: A Physiographic Outline|pages=67, 69, 70, 118|year=1976|publisher=British Columbia Department of Mines and Petroleum Resources}}</ref> It is bordered on the west by the [[Ilgachuz Range]], another mountain range on the Chilcotin Plateau.<ref name="DKQ"/><ref name="FG"/> The Itcha Range is located within one of British Columbia's many territorial divisions known as the [[Range 3 Coast Land District]].<ref>{{BCGNIS|41278|Range 3 Coast Land District|accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>

Stream erosion has played a significant role in dissecting the mountain range, and many of its peaks are dotted with [[glacier]]s.<ref name="AAG"/> This dissection has resulted in a variety of landforms, such as [[valley]]s, [[crag and tail|crags]] and domes. Small graveled [[creek]]s flow from alpine mountains out onto the regional prairies where there are pale blue rock-bottomed lakes, including the so-named Itcha Lake.<ref name="HHJ">{{cite book|last=Hobson|first=Richmond P.|title=Grass Beyond the Mountains|page=207|year=2004|publisher=National Library of Canada Cataloging in Publication|isbn=0-7710-4170-5}}</ref> Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely Corkscrew Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek.<ref name="FG"/> Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by stream erosion and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved.<ref name="AAG"/> Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.<ref name="HHJ"/>

===Climate===
The climate of the Itcha Range is influenced by the presence of the [[Coast Mountains]] to the west, which disrupt the flow of the [[Westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and causes them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the Coast Mountains before reaching the Interior Plateau, casting a [[rain shadow]] over the Itcha Range.<ref name="AAK">{{cite book|last=Benke|first=Arthur C.|coauthors=Cushing, Colbert E.|title=Rivers of North America|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|page=703|year=2005|isbn=0-12-088253-1}}</ref><ref name="QQJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/itcha_ilgachuz/|title=Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park|publisher=[[BC Parks]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> In contrast to the Coast Mountains, the Interior Plateau experiences a precipitation peak in the summer months, reflecting the influence of summer convective storms, and most of winter precipitation falls as snow. The mean annual precipitation for the area ranges from about {{nowrap|{{Convert|40|to|80|cm|in|abbr=on}}}} while the mean annual temperature is approximately {{nowrap|{{convert|3|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}}}, with a summer mean of {{nowrap|{{convert|12.5|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}}} and a winter mean of {{nowrap|{{convert|-8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}}}.<ref name="AAK"/>

==Geology==
===Tectonic setting===
A number of mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the origin of [[volcanism]] in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, including [[rift]] propagation and melting of [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] associated with [[lithosphere|lithospheric]] fracturing due to flexuring of the [[crust (geology)|crust]] along the northern edge of the [[subduction|subducting]] [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].<ref name="FG"/> However, insignificant evidence exists to support these hypotheses.<ref name="FG"/><ref name="QJ"/> The most common and best mechanism used to explain Anahim Belt volcanic activity is a stationary [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. This is supported by a well-defined progression in age of volcanism from west to east along the belt that compares well with the age trend of the [[Yellowstone hotspot]] track. The [[North American Plate]] moves westward over the hotspot at a rate of between {{nowrap|{{Convert|20|and|30|mm|in|abbr=on}}}} per year. [[Nazko Cone]], a [[volcanic cone]] east of the Itcha Range, is centured near the [[Anahim hotspot]].<ref name="QQW">{{cite journal||title=Body-wave tomography of western Canada|last=Mercier|first=J. P.|coauthors=Bostock, M. G.; Cassidy, J. F.; Dueker, K.; Gaherty, J. B.; Garnero, E. J.; Revenaugh, J.; Zandt, G.|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2009|page=9, 11, 12|issn=0040-1951}}</ref>

[[File:Anahim Volcanic Belt-en.svg|thumb|left|350px|alt=Map showing the location of an east-west trending zone of related volcanoes extending from the British Columbia Coast to the interior.|The extent of the [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]], including the [[Rainbow Range (Chilcotin Plateau)|Rainbow]], [[Ilgachuz Range|Ilgachuz]] and Itcha ranges.]]
The Anahim hotspot is underlain by a [[low-velocity zone|low-velocity]] anomaly that extends at least {{nowrap|{{Convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} into the mantle north of the Juan de Fuca Plate. Coupled with the well documented temporal progression of surface volcanism, this has led to the conclusion that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a [[mantle plume]] over slab edge flow. However, the low-velocity anomaly may extend deeper southward beneath the subducted Juan de Fuca [[slab (geology)|slab]]. A small high-velocity anomaly east of Nazko Cone marks the eastern extent of the Anahim hotspot track.<ref name="QQW"/>

===Structure===
The Itcha Range is the smallest shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered.<ref name="FG"/> Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic [[stratigraphic unit|units]] rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small [[alkaline]] shields found in [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] along the [[East African Rift]]. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. [[Glacial striae]] on polished surfaces of some of the oldest volcanic rocks in the eastern part of the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the [[stratigraphy]] indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.<ref name="FG"/>

With a maximum elevation of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2375|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}, the Itcha Range is the lowest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. Its highest point is Mount Downton, which is situated in the middle of the shield. Just to the northeast is Itcha Mountain, the second highest peak with an elevation of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2290|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}. These peaks are situated on top of the shield, which has a [[topographic prominence]] of about {{nowrap|{{Convert|690|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}.<ref name="FG"/>

The Itcha Range has a broad, gently sloping structure typical of shield volcanoes. It is mainly composed of {{nowrap|{{Convert|70|to|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick [[felsic]] lava flows that were erupted from a central vent. These are overlain by {{nowrap|{{Convert|1|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick [[mafic]] alkaline lava flows and at least 30&nbsp;small cinder cones. Hawaiite is the dominant rock type, but alkaline olivine basalt and [[spinel]] [[lherzolite]]-bearing basanite is also present in the Itcha Range. They merge laterally with lavas of the much older [[Chilcotin Group]], which surrounds the Anahim Volcanic Belt. However, the exact nature of the relationship between the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Chilcotin Group is unknown.<ref name="GL"/>

Exposed in the middle of the mountain range is an assemblage of deformed [[andesite]] to [[dacite]] lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments. These [[basement (geology)|basement]] rocks were created during the late [[Mesozoic]] [[era]], long before the Itcha Range formed. They are similar to rocks found in the Hazelton Group, situated north of the Itcha Range, and the Ootsa Lake Group of the [[Intermontane Belt]].<ref name="FG"/>

===Volcanic history===
Two stages of volcanic activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, referred to as the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8&nbsp;and 3.0&nbsp;million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte [[magma]]s to erupt during the shield-building stage suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, [[cupola]]-type [[magma chamber]]s.<ref name="FG"/>

[[File:Itcha Range geology.png|thumb|right|400px|alt=|[[Geologic map]] of the Itcha Range showing stages of development]]
A 900,000&nbsp;year long period of quiescence followed after the felsic shield-building stage, during which time erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence was followed by a mafic capping stage between 2.2&nbsp;and 0.8&nbsp;million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000&nbsp;years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a [[clinopyroxene]], olivine and [[oxide]] assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows continuously decreased in volume and contained less [[silica]] content. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of [[partial melting]] with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.<ref name="FG"/>

The main body of the shield erupted over an area of about {{nowrap|{{Convert|300|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}}}. Volcanic activity associated with the Itcha Range extended {{nowrap|{{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} south to the [[Satah Mountain]] area where lavas erupted along a north-northwest south-southeast fault system and covered an additional area of {{nowrap|{{Convert|250|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}}}.<ref name="FG"/> Although the [[Satah Mountain volcanic field]] is not part of the Itcha Range, it is linked to the range by a volcanic ridge.<ref name="QJ">{{cite book|last=Charland|first=Anne|last2=Francis|first2=Don|pages=150, 238|title=Stratigraphy, Geochemistry and Petrogenesis of the Itcha Volcanic Complex, Central British Columbia|year=1994|publisher=[[McGill University]]|isbn=0-612-00084-2}}</ref> In contrast to the Itcha Range, the Satah Mountain field has probably been active as recently as 7,200&nbsp;years ago.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=320130|title=Satah Mountain|accessdate=2014-07-30}}</ref>

====Felsic shield-building stage====
The felsic shield-building stage began with the eruption of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, [[quartz]]-trachyte and rhyolite lava.<ref name="GL">{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Charles A.|coauthors=Kienle, J<U+00FC>rgen|pages=134, 135|title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada|year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], [[England]]|isbn=0-521-43811-X}}</ref><ref name="FG">{{cite journal|last=Charland|first=Anne|last2=Francis|first2=Don|last3=Ludden|first3=John|title=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|chapter=Stratigraphy and geochemistry of the Itcha Volcanic Complex, central British Columbia|publisher=[[NRC Research Press]]|volume=30|pages=132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 143|year=1992|issn=0008-4077|accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref> Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, [[sulfide]]-bearing rhyolitic [[tuff]]s and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at the summit of the volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A hydrothermally altered aphyric trachyte [[dike (geology)|dike]], which forms a narrow [[ridge]] linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been the source for these eruptions.<ref name="FG"/>

After the basal trachytes were erupted, the explosive phase produced alkali-[[feldspar]] [[porphyritic]] trachytes, which erupted as pyroclastic deposits with minor, small lava flows and domes. The explosive eruptions produced [[pumice]] flows, bedded tuffs, [[debris flow]]s, reworked polymict debris flows and lava flows less than {{nowrap|{{Convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick. The porphyritic trachytes erupted at the summit of the shield and flowed towards the northeast and east. Because the porphyritic pyroclastic deposits are buried by younger volcanic rocks and glacial drift deposits, the maximum thickness of them is unknown.<ref name="FG"/>

The felsic shield-building stage ended with the post-explosive phase. This phase of activity created small [[volcanic plug]]s, lava flows, minor [[pyroclastic flow]]s, channelized debris flows and a few glassy dikes at the summit of the shield volcano. These consist of alkali-feldspar porphyritic quartz-trachyte and trachyte. Alkali-feldspar quartz-trachyte plugs formed in rhyolites and trachytes of the pre-explosive phase, as well as pyroclastic deposits and feldspar trachyte lava flows of the explosive phase. Later activity produced trachyte and phonolite plugs and lava flows. This volcanism occurred mainly at the shield's summit and on its western flank. Massive lava flows from this volcanic activity have a thickness of about {{nowrap|{{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} while three successive lava flows at the summit have a combined thickness of more than {{nowrap|{{Convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}. Lava from the western flank flowed over basement rocks and trachytes of the pre-explosive phase. In contrast, lava from the summit flowed over [[pyroclastic rock]]s and lava flows of the explosive phase. Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain were formed during this eruptive period. The final volcanic event of the post-explosive phase produced {{nowrap|{{Convert|7|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick trachyte lava flows on the western flank.<ref name="FG"/>

====Mafic capping stage====
During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted mainly from small [[parasitic cone]]s, [[tuff ring]]s and [[fissure vent|fissures]] in the eastern half of the shield.<ref name="FG"/> Eruptions occurred [[subglacial eruption|subglacially]], subaqueously and/or [[subaerial eruption|subaerially]] as shown by a wide range in the degree of [[vesicular texture|vesicularity]], freshness and [[volcanic glass|glass]] content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as [[p<U+0101>hoehoe]] and [[<U+02BB>a<U+02BB><U+0101>]], but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly at the southern end of the Itcha Range but also in its interior.<ref name="FG"/>

[[File:Itcha Range .jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The Itcha Range as seen from the south]]
Volcanism of the mafic capping stage began with the eruption of aphyric hawaiite lava flows. These were [[extrusion|extruded]] from dikes and dissected cinder cones in the central and southeastern parts of the Itcha Range. Alkali olivine basalts were erupted contemporaneously from younger better preserved cinder cones and form lava flows reaching {{nowrap|{{Convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick. Once the alkali olivine basalt flows cooled, they formed well-developed [[columnar joints]]. Feldspar-[[phyric]], highly vesiculated hawaiites and [[benmoreite]]s were later erupted from several vents on the summit of Itcha Mountain.<ref name="FG"/>

In the northwestern and northeastern parts of the shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically [[subordinate]]. These represent the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a cinder cone in the middle of the shield could be much younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000&nbsp;to 7,100&nbsp;years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously with the late feldspar hawaiites.<ref name="FG"/>

===Parasitic cones===
Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield were formed mainly during the [[Early Pleistocene]] mafic capping stage between 2.2&nbsp;and 0.8&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name="FG"/> These satellitic vents are monogenetic in nature, meaning each cone was only active for a single eruption sequence before becoming [[extinct volcano|extinct]].<ref name="FG"/><ref name="AHJ">{{cite book|last1=P<U+00E9>rez-L<U+00F3>pez|first1=R.|last2=Legrand|first2=D.|last3=Gardu<U+00F1>o-Monroy|first3=V.

==Human history==
===Naming===
The Itcha Range has had at least two forms of names throughout its history. It was originally named the ''Itcha Mountains'' as identified in the 1930 BC Gazetteer.<ref name="QQQ">{{cite bcgnis|id=2406|name=Itcha Range|accessdate=2014-07-13}}</ref> This form of name remained official until March 13, 1947 when it was changed to its current form, ''Itcha Range'', as part of an official government policy.<ref name="QQQ"/><ref name="AAG"/> Larger mountain ranges throughout British Columbia, such as the Coast Mountains, retained their gazetted names whereas smaller ones, especially ranges of larger groupings, were subjected to renaming.<ref name="AAG"/> In more casual speech, the Itcha Range is referred to as ''the Itchas''.<ref name="HHJ"/> The name ''Itcha'' is [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] in origin, coming from the local Tsilhqot'in people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsilhqotin.ca/PDFs/98DeclarationSovereignty.pdf|title=General Assembly of the Chilcotin Nation: A Declaration of Sovereignty|year=1998|accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref>

Mount Downton was named by D. M. MacKay, a member of the British Columbia Land Surveyors (BCLS) who conducted topographical surveys in the area.<ref name="QQW">{{cite bcgnis|id=14813|name=Mount Downton|accessdate=2014-07-16}}</ref> He named it after Geoffrey M. Downton, another BCLS member who is credited for first noting the hydroelectric potential inherent in the elevation differential between the [[Bridge River]] and [[Seton Lake]] on opposing sides of [[Mission Ridge (British Columbia)|Mission Ridge]] above [[Shalalth]] in December 1912.<ref name="QQW"/><ref>{{cite book|last=V.|first=G. P.|coauthor=Akrigg, Helen B.|title=British Columbia Place Names|page=67|year=1997|publisher=[[University of British Columbia Press]]|isbn=0-7748-0636-2}}</ref> This name for the mountain was adopted on February 7, 1947.<ref name="QQW"/> The name ''Itcha Mountain'' was adopted on March 4, 1954 for the range's second highest peak.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|id=2404|name=Itcha Mountain|accessdate=2014-07-16}}</ref><ref name="FG"/>

===Protection and monitoring===
[[File:RainbowIlgachuzItcha.jpg|thumb|right|The three Anahim [[shield volcano]]es. Left to right are the [[Rainbow Range (Chilcotin Plateau)|Rainbow Range]], the [[Ilgachuz Range]] and the Itcha Range.]]
The mountain range is protected in [[Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park]]. Founded in 1995 as a Class A provincial park, this extremely remote wilderness park covers an area of {{nowrap|{{Convert|111977|ha|acre|abbr=on}}}}. Lying within its boundaries are [[alpine plant|alpine]] [[grassland]]s, [[wetland]]s and wildlife habitat, including the largest herd of [[woodland caribou]] in southern British Columbia. Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park is named after the Itcha and Ilgachuz ranges, the later of which is also in the park.<ref name="QQJ"/>

Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not [[prediction of volcanic activity|monitored]] closely enough by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] to ascertain how active its magma system is. The [[Canadian National Seismograph Network]] has been established to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, but it is too far away to provide a good indication of what is happening under the range. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the Itcha Range becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting.<ref>{{cite paper|last=Hickson|first=Catherine|work=Monitoring volcanoes|title=Volcanoes of Canada|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> If the Itcha Range were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the [[Canada <U+2013> United States border]] or any eruption that will have effects in Canada.<ref>{{cite paper|last=Hickson|first=Catherine|work=Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP)|title=Volcanoes of Canada|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|year=2008|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>

==Volcanic hazards==
===Effects===
Because of the remote location of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely in the form of basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casadevall|first=Thomas J.|page=50|title=Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety: Proceedings of the First International Symposium on Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety|year=1994|publisher=DIANE Publishing|location=[[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]|isbn=0-788-11650-9}}</ref> The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an [[eruption column]] is produced.<ref>{{cite paper|last=Kelman|first=Melanie|title=Catalogue of Canadian volcanoes|work=Nazko Cone|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|year=2008|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref> [[Volcanic ash]] reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neal|first1=Christina A.|last2=Casadevall|first2=Thomas J.|last3=Miller|first3=Thomas P.|last4=Hendley II|first4=James W.|last5=Stauffer|first5=Peter H.|title=Volcanic Ash<U+2013>Danger to Aircraft in the North Pacific|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2004-10-14|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs030-97/|accessdate=2012-11-26}}</ref>
