'''Gyles Daubeney Brandreth''' (born [[March 8]] [[1948]] at a [[British Army|British Forces]] Hospital in [[Germany]]) is a celebrity, author and former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Career==
After having moved to London with his parents aged three, Brandreth was educated at the [[Lyc<U+00E9>e Fran<U+00E7>ais Charles de Gaulle]], [[Bedales School]] and [[New College, Oxford]]. He rose to the Presidency of the [[Oxford Union]] in [[1970]], also editing the University magazine, ''[[Isis (magazine)|Isis]]''. He went on to become a publisher before turning TV presenter, appearing on ''[[Countdown (game show)|Countdown]]'' and ''[[TV-am]]''. He has also presented programmes on London's [[LBC]] radio at various times since [[1973]]. He was renowned for his seemingly endless collection of [[sweater|jumper]]s, though many of the more outrageous examples were sold in a charity auction in 1993 and he has since displayed somewhat more restraint in his dress sense.

In the [[1980s]] Brandreth wrote scripts for ''Dear Ladies'', the television programme featuring [[Hinge and Bracket]]. Brandreth is also the creator of a stage show called ''Zipp!'' which enjoyed success at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and had a short run in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. He is in great demand as an [[after-dinner speaker]], and he holds the world record for the longest continuous after-dinner speech, at eighteen hours, as a charity stunt.

He served as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, representing the [[City of Chester (constituency)|City of Chester]], from [[1992]] to [[1997]]. He also served as a [[whip (politics)|whip]] in [[John Major]]'s government.  He published a book of his diaries from his time as a whip, ''Breaking the Code''.  After his parliamentary career, he broadcast some of his reminiscences on [[BBC]] radio as ''Brandreth on Office'' and ''The Brandreth Rules'' in 2001, 2003 and 2005. He has stated an opposition to the UK's [[honours]] system, and said he will never accept one himself.

In September [[2004]], Brandreth's book on the marriage of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]] was published. In July [[2005]], he published another royal book named ''[[Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a love affair]]'' which is about the three-decades love affair between the newly-married [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall]]. He had previously written an authorised biography of [[John Gielgud]], the actor, and many joke, comedy and children's books. One of his books, ''All Wrong on the Night'', is a compilation of anecdotes about theatrical performances going wrong due to missed cues, faulty props or mangled dialogue. The book's title parodies a phrase often heard when a play is in rehearsal prior to its opening performance: anyone who misses a cue or commits any other error during rehearsal typically assures his colleagues that it will be "all right on the night" (of the opening).

From 2003 to 2005 Brandreth hosted the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[Whispers (radio series)|Whispers]]''. In [[August 2005]], he appeared in a production of [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at the Edinburgh Festival. In 2006, Brandreth appeared in the BBC Radio 4 comedy programme ''[[Living with the Enemy]]'' which he co-wrote with comedian [[Nick Revell]], in which they appear as a former Conservative government minister and a former comedian. He appeared on the television series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look]]'' in the same year as being a guest on [[Numberwang]]. In 2007, he guest-starred in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' audio play ''[[I.D. (Doctor Who audio)|I.D.]]''

He is also a former European [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] champion{{Fact|date=February 2007}} and President of the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]], having organised the first UK National [[Scrabble]] Championship in 1972.

==Personal life==
Brandreth has been married to Michele Brown since [[8 June]] [[1973]]. They met at Oxford University, where she was at [[St Anne's College]], on a dormitory corridor with three other women - [[Edwina Currie]], [[Mary Archer, Baroness Archer of Weston-super-Mare|Mary Archer]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]] [Doubtful as Ann Widdecombe went to Lady Margaret Hall]. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The couple have three children, and are also the founders of the [[Teddy Bear]] museum in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].
