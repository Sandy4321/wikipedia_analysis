[[File:Periodic table.svg|thumb|right|300px|Standard form of the periodic table. The colors represent different series of elements explained below.]]

A '''periodic table''' is a tabular display of the [[chemical element]]s, organized on the basis of their [[atomic number]]s, [[electron configuration]]s, and recurring [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number (number of protons). The standard form of table comprises an 18 <U+00D7> 7 grid or main body of elements, positioned above a smaller double row of elements. The table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks: the [[s-block]] to the left, the [[p-block]] to the right, the [[d-block]] in the middle, and the [[f-block]] below that. The rows of the table are called [[Periodic table period|periods]]; the columns of the s-, d-, and p-blocks are called [[Periodic table group|groups]], with some of these having trivial names such as the [[halogens]] or the [[noble gases]]. Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates [[periodic trends| recurring trends]], any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet to be discovered or synthesized, elements. As a result, a periodic table<U+2014>whether in the standard form or some other variant<U+2014>provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely use in chemistry and other sciences.

Although precursors exist, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table. He developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the then-known elements. Mendeleev also predicted some properties of [[Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted elements|then-unknown elements]] that would be expected to fill gaps in this table. Most of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discovered. Mendeleev's periodic table has since been expanded and refined with [[element discovery|the discovery or synthesis of further new elements]] and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behavior. 

All elements from atomic numbers 1 ([[hydrogen]]) to 118 ([[ununoctium]]) have been discovered or synthesized. Of these, all up to and including [[californium]]<!-- see discussion at [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Elements/Archive_12#Natural_occurrence]] if confounded --> exist naturally; the rest have only been synthesised in laboratories. Production of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued, with the question of how the periodic table may need to be [[Extended periodic table|modified]] to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debate. Numerous synthetic [[radionuclide]]s of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.

== Layout ==
{{for|a larger version|Periodic table (large version)}}
{{periodic table}}
All versions of the periodic table include only chemical elements, not [[mixture]]s, [[chemical compound|compounds]], or [[subatomic particle]]s.<ref group="n">Some tables include an [[neutronium|element zero]] (i.e. a substance composed purely of neutrons), although this is uncommon. See, for example. Philip Stewart's [[Chemical Galaxy]].</ref> Each chemical element has a unique atomic number representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of [[neutron]]s among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as [[isotope]]s. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons and most have six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.<ref name="Greenwood">Greenwood, pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref>

In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number (the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an atom). A new row ([[Period (periodic table)|''period'']]) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns ([[Group (periodic table)|''groups'']]) are determined by the [[electron configuration]] of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. [[oxygen]] and [[selenium]] are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.<ref>Gray, p. 6</ref>

As of 2012, the periodic table contains 118 confirmed chemical elements. Of these elements, 114 have been officially recognized and named by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). A total of 98 of these occur naturally, of which 84 are [[primordial nuclide|primordial]]. The other 16 elements only occur in [[decay chain]]s of primordial elements.<ref name="emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7}}</ref> All elements from [[einsteinium]] to [[copernicium]], as well as flerovium and livermorium, while not occurring naturally in the universe, have been duly synthesized and officially recognized by the IUPAC.

== Grouping methods ==

=== Groups ===
{{Main|Group (periodic table)}}

A ''group'' or ''family'' is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. In some groups, the elements have very similar properties and exhibit a clear trend in properties down the group.<ref>{{cite book |last=Messler|first=R. W.|title=The essence of materials for engineers|year=2010|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|location=Sudbury, MA|isbn=0763778338|page=32}}</ref> Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).<ref name="IUPAC">{{cite book |title=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: Recommendations 1990|last=Leigh |first=G. J. |year=1990 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0-632-02494-1}}</ref> Previously, they were known by [[roman numerals]]. In America, the roman numerals were followed by either an "A" if the group was in the [[s-block|s-]] or [[p-block]], or a "B" if the group was in the [[d-block]]. The roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g. the [[group 4 element]]s were group IVB, and the [[group 14 elements|carbon group]] was group IVA). In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that "A" was used if the group was before [[group 10 elements|group 10]], and "B" was used for groups including and after group 10. In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII. In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E.|year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

Some of these groups have been given [[Collective names of groups of like elements|trivial (unsystematic) names]], as seen in the table to the right, although some are rarely used. Groups 3<U+2013>10 have no trivial names and are referred to simply by their group numbers or by the name of the first member of their group (such as 'the scandium group' for [[Group 3 element|Group 3]]), since they display fewer similarities and/or vertical trends.<ref name="IUPAC" />

Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their [[valence shell]], which is able to explain their similar properties.<ref>Scerri 2007, p. 24</ref> Elements in the same group show patterns in [[atomic radius]], [[ionization energy]], and [[electronegativity]]. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because it is easier to remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top to bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus.<ref name="For Dummies">Moore, p. 111</ref> There are exceptions to these trends, however, an example of which is that in [[group 11 element|group 11]], the electronegativity increases farther down the group.<ref name="Greenwood30"/>

=== Periods ===
{{Main|Period (periodic table)}}

A ''period'' is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s form two substantial horizontal series of elements.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stoker|first=Stephen H.|title=General, organic, and biological chemistry|year=2007|page=68|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-618-73063-6|oclc=52445586}}</ref>

Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, [[electron affinity]], and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mascetta |first=Joseph |title=Chemistry The Easy Way |year=2003|publisher=Hauppauge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7641-1978-1 |oclc=52047235|edition=4th |page=50}}</ref> This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases in the same manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus.<ref name="For Dummies"/> Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kotz |first1=John |last2=Treichel |first2=Paul|last3=Townsend |first3=John |title=Chemistry and Chemical Reactivity, Volume 2|edition=7th |year=2009|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont |isbn=978-0-495-38712-1 |oclc=220756597 |page=324}}</ref>

=== Blocks ===
{{Main|Block (periodic table)}}

[[File:Periodic Table 2.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|A diagram of the periodic table, highlighting the different blocks]]

Because of the importance of the outermost electron shell, the different regions of the periodic table are sometimes referred to as ''blocks'', named according to the subshell in which the "last" electron resides.<ref name="Gray12"/> The [[s-block]] comprises the first two groups (alkali metals and alkaline earth metals) as well as hydrogen and helium. The [[p-block]] comprises the last six groups which are groups 13 to 18 in IUPAC (3A&nbsp;to 8A in American) and contains, among other elements, all of the [[metalloid]]s. The d-block comprises groups 3 to 12 in IUPAC (or&nbsp;3B to 2B in American group numbering) and contains all of the transition metals. The f-block, usually offset below the rest of the periodic table, comprises the lanthanides and actinides.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Chris |title=d- and f-block chemistry |year=2002 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-22476-1|oclc=300468713 |page=2}}</ref>

=== Other conventions and variations ===

In presentations of the periodic table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below the main body of the table,<ref>Gray, p. 11</ref> with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either [[actinium]] or [[lawrencium]], respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between [[barium]] and [[hafnium]], and [[radium]] and [[rutherfordium]], respectively. This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used [[periodic table (wide)|wide-formatted periodic table]] inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).

== Periodic trends ==
{{Main|Periodic trends}}

=== Electron configuration ===
{{Main|Electronic configuration}}
[[File:Klechkovski rule.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Approximate order in which shells and subshells are arranged by increasing energy according to the [[Madelung rule]].]]
The electron configuration or organisation of electrons orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy a series of [[electron shell]]s (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists of one or more [[Electron_shell#Subshells|subshells]] (named s, p, d, f and g). As [[atomic number]] increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the [[Madelung rule]] or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram to the right. The electron configuration for [[neon]], for example, is 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup>. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell<U+2014>two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by [[hydrogen]] and the [[alkali metals]].<ref name=Myers>{{cite book |last=Myers|first=R.|title=The basics of chemistry|year=2003|pages=61<U+2013>67|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313316643}}</ref><ref name=chang2>{{cite book |last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|edition=7|isbn=0-07-112072-6|pages=289<U+2013>310; 340<U+2013>42}}</ref>

[[File:Periodic trends.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Periodic table trends. Arrows point at increase.]]

Since the properties of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, the properties of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagram on the left. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which [[Johann Wolfgang D<U+00F6>bereiner|were noticed well before]] the [[Niels Bohr|underlying theory was developed]], that led to the establishment of the periodic law (the properties of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.<ref name=Myers/><ref name=chang2/>

=== Atomic radii ===
{{main|Atomic radius}}
[[File:Empirical atomic radius trends.png|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Atomic number plotted against atomic radius<ref group="n">The noble gases, astatine, francium, and all elements heavier than [[americium]] were left out as there is no data for them.</ref>]]
Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each period of the table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group.  The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period.  These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].<ref name="Greenwood27">Greenwood, p. 27</ref>

The electrons in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from [[cerium]] (''Z''&nbsp;= 58) to lutetium (''Z''&nbsp;= 71), are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii which are smaller than would be expected and which are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them.<ref name="Jolly_contract">

}}</ref> Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as [[zirconium]], and [[tantalum]] has an atomic radius similar to [[niobium]], and so forth. This is known as the [[lanthanide contraction]]. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to [[platinum]] (''Z''&nbsp;= 78), after which it is masked by a [[relativistic effect]] known as the [[inert pair effect]].<ref name="Greenwood28">Greenwood, p. 28</ref> The [[d-block contraction]], which is a similar effect between the [[d-block]] and [[p-block]], is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.<ref name="Jolly_contract"/>

=== Ionization energy ===

[[File:Ionization energies.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Ionization energy. Each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the noble gases.]]

{{main|Ionization energy}}

The first ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove an electron from an atom, and the second ionization energy is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from an atom. Future ionization energies follow this same pattern. Higher ionization energies tend to be larger than lower ionization energies. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and to the right of the periodic table.<ref name="Greenwood28"/>

Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when passing noble gas configurations.  For example, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s electrons from a magnesium atom) are 738 and 1450&nbsp;kJ/mol. The third ionization energy is a much larger (7730&nbsp;kJ/mol) and corresponds to stripping off a 2p electron from the very stable [[neon]]-like configuration of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row energies.<ref name="Greenwood28"/>

=== Electronegativity ===
{{main|Electronegativity}}

[[Image:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Graph showing increasing electronegativity with growing number of selected groups]]

Electronegativity is the tendency of an [[atom]] to attract [[electron]]s.<ref name="definition">{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}</ref> An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its [[atomic number]] and the distance between the [[valence electrons]] and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by [[Linus Pauling]] in 1932.<ref name="paulingJACS">{{cite journal |author= Pauling, L. |authorlink=Linus Pauling |year= 1932 |journal= [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] |volume= 54
 |issue= 9 |pages= 3570<U+2013>3582 |title= The Nature of the Chemical Bond. IV. The Energy of Single Bonds and the Relative Electronegativity of Atoms |doi= 10.1021/ja01348a011}}</ref> In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements,<ref group="n">While fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements under the [[Pauling scale]], [[neon]] is the most electronegative element under other scales, such as the [[Allen scale]].</ref> while [[caesium]]<!-- not francium; please don't change unless you supply a citation for published experimental results --> is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.<ref name="Greenwood30">Greenwood, p. 30</ref>

There are some exceptions to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than [[aluminium]] and [[silicon]] respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity.<ref name="Greenwood30"/> The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to [[thallium]] and [[bismuth]], appears to be an artifact of data selection (and data availability)<U+2014>methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Allred |first=A. L. |year=1960 |title=Electronegativity values from thermochemical data |journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry |volume=17 |issue=3<U+2013>4 |pages=215<U+2013>221 |publisher=Northwestern University |doi=10.1016/0022-1902(61)80142-5 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022190261801425 |accessdate=11 June 2012 }}</ref>

=== Electron affinity ===
{{main|Electron affinity}}
[[File:Electron affinity of the elements.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Periodic trend for electron affinity.<ref>Huheey, Keiter & Keiter, p. 42</ref> Each period beings at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the halogens.]]

The electron affinity of an atom is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although electron affinity varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, [[nonmetals]] have more positive electron affinity values than [[metal]]s. [[Chlorine]] most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.<ref name=chang>Chang, pp. 307<U+2013>309</ref>

Electron affinity generally increases across a period. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and is therefore more stable.<ref name=chang/>

A trend of decreasing electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital farther away from the nucleus. As such this electron would less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, this is due to the poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.<ref>Huheey, Keiter & Keiter, pp. 42, 880<U+2013>81</ref>

=== Metallic character ===
The lower the values of ionization energy, electronegativity and electron affinity the more [[metal]]lic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yoder |first=C. H.|last2=Suydam|second= F. H.|last3=Snavely|third=F. A. |year=1975 |title=Chemistry |page=58 |edition=2nd |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |isbn=0-15-506465-7}}</ref> Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and [[relativistic effects]],<ref>Huheey, Keiter & Keiter, pp. 880<U+2013>85</ref> tends to increase going down a group. Thus, the most metallic elements (such as [[caesium]] and [[francium]]) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements ([[oxygen]], [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]]) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped [[dividing line between metals and nonmetals]] found on some periodic tables, and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as [[metalloid]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sacks|first=O|title=Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a chemical boyhood|year=2009|publisher=Alfred A.

{{Main|History of the periodic table}}

=== First systemization attempts ===

[[File:Discovery8.png|300px|thumb|The [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the elements]] mapped to significant periodic table development dates (pre-, per- and post-)]]
In 1789, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] published a list of 33 [[chemical element]]s, grouping them into [[gas]]es, [[metal]]s, [[nonmetal]]s, and [[Earth (chemistry)|earths]];<ref>{{cite book |title=From elements to atoms: a history of chemical composition |last=Siegfried |first=Robert |year=2002 |page=92 |publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data |isbn=0-87169-924-9 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}</ref> Chemists spent the following century searching for a more precise classification scheme. In 1829, [[Johann Wolfgang D<U+00F6>bereiner]] observed that many of the elements could be grouped into triads based on their chemical properties. [[Lithium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]], for example, were grouped together in a triad as soft, [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals. D<U+00F6>bereiner also observed that, when arranged by atomic weight, the second member of each triad was roughly the average of the first and the third;<ref name="Ball100">Ball, p. 100</ref> this became known as the [[D<U+00F6>bereiner's triads|Law of Triads]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Horvitz |first=Leslie |title=Eureka!: Scientific Breakthroughs That Changed The World |year=2002 |publisher=John Wiley |location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23341-1 |oclc=50766822 |page=43}}</ref> German chemist [[Leopold Gmelin]] worked with this system, and by 1843 he had identified ten triads, three groups of four, and one group of five. [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]] published work in 1857 describing relationships between various groups of metals. Although various chemists were able to identify relationships between small groups of elements, they had yet to build one scheme that encompassed them all.<ref name="Ball100"/>

In 1858, German chemist [[Friedrich August Kekul<U+00E9> von Stradonitz|August Kekul<U+00E9>]] observed that [[carbon]] often has four other atoms bonded to it. [[Methane]], for example, has one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. This concept eventually became known as [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]]; different elements bond with different numbers of atoms.<ref>{{cite book |last=van Spronsen|first=J. W.|title=The periodic system of chemical elements|year=1969|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=444-40776-6|page=19}}</ref>

In 1862, [[Alexandre-Emile B<U+00E9>guyer de Chancourtois]], a French geologist, published an early form of periodic table, which he called the telluric helix or screw. He was the first person to notice the periodicity of the elements. With the elements arranged in a spiral on a cylinder by order of increasing atomic weight, de Chancourtois showed that elements with similar properties seemed to occur at regular intervals. His chart included some ions and compounds in addition to elements. His paper also used geological rather than chemical terms and did not include a diagram; as a result, it received little attention until the work of [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].<ref>[http://www.annales.org/archives/x/chancourtois.html Annales des Mines history page].</ref>

In 1864, [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], a German chemist, published a table with 44 elements arranged by valency. The table showed that elements with similar properties often shared the same valency.<ref>Venable, pp. 85<U+2013>86; 97</ref> Concurrently, [[William Odling]] (an English chemist) published an arrangement of 57 elements, ordered on the basis of their atomic weights. With some irregularities and gaps, he noticed what appeared to be a periodicity of atomic weights amongst the elements and that this accorded with 'their usually received groupings.' <ref>{{cite journal |last=Odling |first=W.|title=On the proportional numbers of the elements|journal=Quarterly Journal of Science|year=2002 |volume=1|pages=642<U+2013>648 (643)}}</ref> Odling alluded to the idea of a periodic law but did not pursue it.<ref name=Scerri2011>{{cite book |last=Scerri|first=Eric R.|title=The periodic table: A very short introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199582495}}</ref> He subsequently proposed (in 1870) a valence-based classification of the elements.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kaji |first=M. |editor1-first=D.

English chemist [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]] produced a series of papers in 1864 and 1865 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar physical and chemical properties recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the [[octave]]s of music.<ref>{{cite journal |title = On Relations Among the Equivalents |author = Newlands, John A.

In 1867, [[Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs|Gustavus Hinrichs]], a Danish born academic chemist based in America, published a spiral periodic system based on atomic spectra and weights, and chemical similarities.

=== Mendeleev's table ===
[[File:Medeleeff by repin.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|Dmitri Mendeleev]]
[[File:Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table.png|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table; note that his arrangement presents the periods vertically, and the groups horizontally.]]

Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic tables in 1869 and 1870, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mendelejew |first=Dimitri |year=1869 |title=<U+00DC>ber die Beziehungen der Eigenschaften zu den Atomgewichten der Elemente |journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Chemie |pages=405<U+2013>406 |language=German}}</ref> Mendeleev's table was his first published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864.<ref>Venable, pp. 96<U+2013>97; 100<U+2013>102</ref> They both constructed their tables by listing the elements in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of the elements began to repeat.<ref>Ball, pp. 100<U+2013>102</ref> 

The recognition and acceptance afforded Mendeleev's table came from two decisions he made. The first was to leave gaps in the table when it seemed that the corresponding element had not yet been discovered.<ref>{{cite book |author=Pullman, Bernard |title=The Atom in the History of Human Thought |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=227 |isbn=0-19-515040-6|others=Translated by Axel Reisinger}}</ref> Mendeleev was not the first chemist to do so, but he was the first to be recognized as using the trends in his periodic table to predict the properties of those [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|missing elements]], such as [[gallium]] and germanium.<ref>Ball, p. 105</ref> The second decision was to occasionally ignore the order suggested by the atomic weights and switch adjacent elements, such as [[tellurium]] and [[iodine]], to better classify them into chemical families. With the development of theories of atomic structure, it became apparent that Mendeleev had unintentionally listed the elements in order of increasing atomic number or nuclear charge.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Periodic Kingdom |author=Atkins, P. W. |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc. |year=1995 |page=87|isbn=0-465-07265-8}}</ref>

The significance of atomic numbers to the organization of the periodic table was not appreciated until the existence and properties of protons and neutrons became understood. Mendeleev's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements, information determinable to fair precision in his time. Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to (as noted) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known. Substitution of atomic numbers, once understood, gave a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements, still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Nucl.

[[File:ShortPT10b.png|thumb|left|300px|Short form of periodic table, as originally published by Mendeleev in 1871, updated with all elements discovered to 2012.]]
In 1871, Mendeleev published an updated form of periodic table (shown at left), as well as giving detailed predictions for the elements he had earlier noted were missing, but should exist.<ref>Scerri 2007, p. 112</ref> These gaps were subsequently filled as chemists discovered additional naturally occurring elements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kaji |first=Masanori |year=2002 |title=D.I.

The popular<ref>Gray, p.&nbsp; 12</ref> periodic table layout, also known as the common or standard form (as shown at various other points in this article), is attributable to Horace Groves Deming. In 1923, Deming, an American chemist, published short ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=456 Mendeleev style]) and medium ([http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook/35_pt/pt_database.php?PT_id=360 18-column]) form periodic tables.<ref>{{cite book |last=Deming|first=Horace G|title=General chemistry: An elementary survey|year=1923 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |location=New York |pages =160, 165}}</ref> Merck and Company prepared a handout form of Deming's 18-column medium table, in 1928, which was widely circulated in American schools. By the 1930s Deming's table was appearing in handbooks and encyclopaedias of chemistry. It was also distributed for many years by the Sargent-Welch Scientific Company.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abraham|first1=M|last2=Coshow|first2=D|last3=Fix|first3=W|title=Periodicity:A source book module, version 1.0|publisher=Chemsource, Inc.|location=New York|page=3|url=http://dwb4.unl.edu/chem_source_pdf/PERD.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Emsley|first=J|title=Mendeleyev's dream table|journal=New Scientist|date=7 March 1985|pages=32<U+2013>36(36)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fluck|first=E|year=1988|title=New notations in the period table|journal=Pure & Applied Chemistry|volume=60|issue= 3|pages=431<U+2013>436 (432)|doi=10.1351/pac198860030431}}</ref>

With the development of modern [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] theories of [[electron]] configurations within atoms, it became apparent that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a [[electron shell|quantum shell]] of electrons. Larger atoms have more electron sub-shells, so later tables have required progressively longer periods.<ref>Ball, p. 111</ref>

[[File:Glenn Seaborg 1964.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Glenn T. Seaborg]] who, in 1945, suggested a new periodic table showing the actinides as belonging to a second f-block series]]

In 1945, [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Glenn Seaborg]], an American scientist, made the suggestion that the [[actinides|actinide elements]], like the [[lanthanides]] were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin has career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently went on to win the 1951 Nobel prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing actinide elements.<ref>Scerri 2007, pp. 270<U+2012>71</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Masterton|first1=William L. |last2=Hurley|first2=Cecile N.|last3=Neth|first3=Edward J.|title=Chemistry: Principles and reactions|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|edition=7th|isbn=1111427100|page=173}}</ref>

Although minute quantities of some [[transuranic elements]] occur naturally,<ref name="emsley"/> they were all first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, the first of these being [[neptunium]], synthesized in 1939.<ref>Ball, p. 123</ref> Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and [[radioactivity|decay]] quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been [[element naming controversy|controversies]] concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights.

There are many periodic tables with layouts other than that of the common or standard form. Within 100 years of the appearance of Mendeleev's table in 1869 it has been estimated that around 700 different periodic table versions were published.<ref name=Scerri20>Scerri 2007, p. 20</ref> As well as numerous rectangular variations, other periodic table formats have included, for example,<ref group="n">See [http://www.meta-synthesis.com/webbook//35_pt/pt_database.php ''The Internet database of periodic tables''] for depictions of these kinds of variants.</ref> circular, cubic, cylindrical, edificial (building-like), helical, [http://cultureofchemistry.fieldofscience.com/2009/03/weird-words-of-science-lemniscate.html lemniscate], octagonal prismatic, pyramidal, separated, spherical, spiral, and triangular forms.

== Open questions and controversies ==

=== Elements with unknown chemical properties ===
Although all elements up to ununoctium have been discovered, only elements up to [[hassium]] (element 108), along with [[copernicium]] (element 112), have known chemical properties. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though it is currently placed in the [[carbon group]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements|last=Sch<U+00E4>ndel|first=Matthias|year=2003|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|isbn=1-4020-1250-0|page=277|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.<ref>Scerri 2011, pp. 142<U+2013>143</ref>

=== Further periodic table extensions ===
{{main|Extended periodic table}}
It is unclear whether new elements will continue the pattern of the current periodic table as [[Period 8 element|period 8]], or require further adaptations or adjustments. [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] expected the eighth period, which includes a two-element s-block for elements [[ununennium|119]] and [[unbinilium|120]], a new [[g-block]] for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3963006|last=Frazier|first=K.|title=Superheavy Elements|journal=Science News|volume=113|issue=15|pages=236<U+2013>238|year=1978|jstor=3963006}}</ref> More recently, physicists such as [[Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>]] have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the [[Madelung rule]], which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykk<U+00F6>|first1=Pekka|authorlink=Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z <U+2264> 172, based on Dirac<U+2013>Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161<U+2013>168|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P}}</ref>

;Bohr model
The [[Bohr model]] exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, as any element with an atomic number greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than ''c'', the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref> Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is inaccurate when applied to such an element.

;Relativistic Dirac equation
The [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] Dirac equation has problems for elements with more than 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the [[Klein paradox]].<ref>

=== Placement of hydrogen and helium ===
Hydrogen and [[helium]] are often placed in different places than their electron configurations would indicate; hydrogen is usually placed above lithium, in accordance with its electron configuration, but is sometimes placed above [[fluorine]],<ref name="hydrogen" /> or even carbon,<ref name="hydrogen">{{cite journal |last=Cronyn |first=Marshall W. |title=The Proper Place for Hydrogen in the Periodic Table |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=8 |year=2003 |month=August |pages=947<U+2013>951|bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..947C |doi = 10.1021/ed080p947 }}</ref> as it also behaves somewhat similarly to them. Hydrogen is also sometimes placed in its own group, as it does not behave similarly enough to any element to be placed in a group with another.<ref>Gray, p. 14</ref> Helium is almost always placed above [[neon]], as they are very similar chemically, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium on account of having a comparable electron shell configuration (helium: 1s<sup>2</sup>; beryllium: [He] 2s<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="Gray12">Gray, p. 12</ref>

=== Groups included in the transition metals ===
The definition of a [[transition metal]], as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=T06456|title=transition element}}</ref> By this definition all of the elements in groups 3<U+2013>11 are transition metals. The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.

Some chemists treat the categories "[[d-block]] elements" and "transition metals" interchangeably, thereby including groups 3<U+2013>12 among the transition metals. In this instance the group 12 elements are treated as a special case of transition metal in which the d electrons are not ordinarily involved in chemical bonding. The recent discovery that mercury can use its d electrons in the formation of [[mercury(IV) fluoride]] (HgF<sub>4</sub>) has prompted some commentators to suggest that mercury can be regarded as a transition metal.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Xuefang Wang |coauthors=Lester Andrews; Sebastian Riedel; and Martin Kaupp |title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF<sub>4</sub>. |journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |year=2007 |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=8371<U+2013>8375 |doi=10.1002/anie.200703710 |pmid=17899620}}</ref> Other commentators, such as Jensen,<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |title=Is Mercury Now a Transition Element? |author=William B. Jensen |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |year=2008 |volume=85 |pages=1182<U+2013>1183 |doi=10.1021/ed085p1182|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85.1182J }}</ref> have argued that the formation of a compound like HgF<sub>4</sub> can occur only under highly abnormal conditions. As such, mercury could not be regarded as a transition metal by any reasonable interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term.<ref name=Jensen/>

Still other chemists further exclude the [[group 3 element]]s from the definition of a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rayner-Canham|first1=G|last2=Overton|first2=T|title=Descriptive inorganic chemistry|publisher=W H Freeman|Publishers|pages=484<U+2013>485|location=New York|edition=4th|isbn=0716789639}}</ref> In this case, only groups 4<U+2013>11 are regarded as transition metals.

=== Period 6 and 7 elements in group 3 ===
Although scandium and yttrium are always the first two [[group 3 element]]s, the identity of the next two elements is not agreed upon; they are either lanthanum and actinium, or lutetium and lawrencium. Although there are some strong physical and chemical arguments supporting the latter arrangement not all authors are convinced.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scerri|first=E|year=2012|title=|Mendeleev's periodic table is finally completed and what to do about group 3?|journal=Chemistry International|volume=34|issue= 4|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2012/3404/ud.html|title=Mendeleev's Periodic Table Is Finally Completed and What To Do about Group 3?}}</ref>

=== Optimal form ===
The many different forms of periodic table have prompted the question of whether there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many different forms of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements. The ubiquity of the standard or medium-long periodic table is thought to be a result of this layout having a good balance of features in terms of ease of construction and size, and its depiction of atomic order and periodic trends.<ref name=Scerri2011/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Francl |first=Michelle |title=Table manners |journal=Nature Chemistry |year=2009 |volume=1 |month=May |pages=97<U+2013>98|url=http://ericscerri.com/Michelle-Nat%20Chem.pdf}}</ref>
