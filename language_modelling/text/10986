'''Ethel Barrymore''' (August 15, 1879 <U+2013> June 18, 1959) was an American actress and a member of the [[Barrymore family]] of actors.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', June 24, 1959.</ref>

==Early life==
Ethel Barrymore was born '''Ethel Mae Blythe''' in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], the second child of the actors [[Maurice Barrymore]] (whose real name was Herbert Blythe) and [[Georgiana Drew]]. Named after her father<U+2019>s favorite character<U+2014>Ethel in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]<U+2019>s ''The Newcomes''<U+2014>she was one of the twentieth century<U+2019>s most elegant, beautiful and gifted actresses. 

She was the sister of actors [[John Barrymore]] and [[Lionel Barrymore]], the aunt of actor [[John Drew Barrymore]], and the great-aunt of actress [[Drew Barrymore]]. She was also the niece of Broadway matin<U+00E9>e idol [[John Drew Jr]] and early [[Vitagraph]] movie star [[Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]].

She spent her childhood in Philadelphia, and attended [[Roman Catholic]] schools there.

==Career==
Ethel Barrymore was a highly regarded [[theater|stage]] actress in [[New York City]] and a major [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performer. Many today consider her to be the greatest actress of her generation. 

Her first appearance in Broadway was in 1895, in a play called ''The Imprudent Young Couple'' which starred her uncle [[John Drew, Jr.]] and [[Maude Adams]]. She appeared with Drew and Adams again in 1896 in ''Rosemary''. 

In 1897 Ethel went with [[William Gillette]] to London to play Miss Kittridge in Gillette's ''Secret Service''. The play, Gillette<U+2019>s greatest work, was a huge success, but Ethel remained pretty much beneath everyone's radar scopes until one night when the leading actress, [[Odette Taylor]], became ill and went home, still dressed in her costume.  Ethel was standing in the wings in her nurse<U+2019>s costume when the theater manager told her she would have to replace Taylor, dressed as she was.  Ethel protested that she didn<U+2019>t know Ms. Taylor<U+2019>s part, but she went out in her nurse<U+2019>s uniform and carried the show.  It was a splendid performance, and she was noticed.  

She was about to return to the States with Gillette's troupe when [[Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] offered her the role of Annette in ''The Bells''. A full London tour was on and, before it was over, Ethel created, on New Years Day 1898, Euphrosine in ''Peter the Great'' at the Lyceum, the play having been written by Irving's son, Laurence. Men everywhere were smitten with Ethel, most notably young [[Winston Churchill]], who asked her to marry him. Not wishing to be a politician's wife, she refused. Winston, several years later, married Clementine Hozier, a ravishing beauty who looked very much like Ethel, but Winston and Ethel remained friends until the end of her life. Their <U+201C>romance<U+201D> was their own little secret until his son let the cat out of the bag 63 years after it happened.<ref>Frohman, Daniel, & Isaac F. Marcosson, <U+201C>The Life of Charles Frohman,<U+201D> ''Cosmopolitan'', Volume 61, 1916, p. 370.</ref>

After her big season in London, Ethel returned to America. [[Charles Frohman]] cast her first in ''Catherine'' and then as Stella de Grex in ''His Excellency the Governor''.  After that, Frohman finally gave Ethel the role that would make her a star: Madame Trentoni in ''Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines'', which opened at the Garrick Theatre on February 4, 1901. When the tour concluded in Boston in June, she had out-drawn two of the most prominent actresses of her day, Mrs. Patrick Campbell and Minnie Maddern Fiske.

Following her triumph in ''Captain Jinks'', Ethel gave sterling performances in many top-rate productions, and it was in ''Sunday'' that she uttered what would be her most famous line, "That's all there is, there isn't any more."<ref>Peters, Margot, ''The House of Barrymore'' (Simon & Schuster, 1991), pp. 95, 97; Barrymore, Ethel, ''Memories, An Autobiography'' (Harper, 1955), p. 148.</ref>

Ethel portrayed Nora in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] (1905), and [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (1922).

She was also a strong supporter of the [[Actors' Equity Association]] and had a high-profile role in the 1919 strike. In 1926, she scored one of her greatest successes as the sophisticated spouse of a philandering husband in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s comedy, ''[[The Constant Wife]]''. She starred in ''Rasputin and the Empress'' (1932), with John and Lionel Barrymore, playing the Czarina married to Czar Nicholas.  In July 1934, she starred in the play ''Laura Garnett'', by [[Leslie Stokes|Leslie]] and [[Sewell Stokes]], at [[Dobbs Ferry]], New York State.

After she became a stage star, she would often dismiss adoring audiences who kept demanding curtain calls by saying "That's all there is - there isn't any more!" This became a popular catch phrase in the 1920s and 1930s. Many references to it can be found in the media of the period, including the [[Laurel and Hardy]] 1933 film ''Sons of the Desert'', and [[Arthur Train]]'s 1930 Wall Street Crash novel ''Paper Profits''.

Barrymore was a baseball and boxing fan. Her admiration for boxing ended when she witnessed as a spectator the brutality of the July 4, 1919, [[Jess Willard|Dempsey/Willard]] fight in which [[Jack Dempsey|Dempsey]] broke Willard's jaw and knocked out several of his teeth. Ethel vowed never to attend another boxing match though she would later watch boxing on television.

She appeared in her first motion picture, ''The Nightingale'', in 1914. Members of her family were already in pictures; uncle Sidney and Lionel had entered films in 1911 and John made his first feature in 1913. She made 15 silent pictures between 1914 and 1919 most of them for the old [[Metro Pictures|Metro]] studio. Most of these pictures were made on the East Coast, as her Broadway career and children came first. All of her silent films are lost with the exception of ''The Awakening of Helena Ritchie'' (1916) which survives incomplete at the [[Library of Congress]] and ''The Call of Her People''(1917) held at George Eastman House, Rochester.<ref>Catalog of Holdings, The American Film Institute Collection and the United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress, published by The American Film Institute c. 1978; for '''The Awakening of Helena Ritchie'''(1916)</ref><ref>[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/C/CallOfHerPeople1917.html ''The Call of Her People'' at '''silentera.com''']</ref>  In the 1940s, she moved to [[Hollywood, California]]. The only two films that featured all three siblings<U+2014>Ethel, John and Lionel<U+2014>were ''National Red Cross Pageant'' (1917) and ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'' (1932). The former film is now [[lost films|lost]].

She won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in the 1944 film ''[[None but the Lonely Heart (film)|None but the Lonely Heart]]'' opposite [[Cary Grant]], but made plain that she was not overly impressed by it. On March 22, 2007, her Oscar was offered for sale on [[eBay]]. 

She appeared in ''[[The Spiral Staircase]]'' (1946) directed by [[Robert Siodmak]], ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947) directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and ''[[Portrait of Jennie]]'' (1948), among others. Her last film appearance was in ''Johnny Trouble'' (1957). She also made a number of television appearances in the 1950s, including one memorable encounter with comedian [[Jimmy Durante]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[All Star Revue]]'' on December 1, 1951 (preserved on a [[kinescope]]).

In 1949, Barrymore appeared in the Academy Award winning film ''Pinky'' for which she was awarded an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

==Private life==
[[File:Ethel Barrymore.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Ethel Barrymore by [[Carl Van Vechten]] (December 12, 1937)]][[File:Ethel Barrymore family 1914.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ethel Barrymore, husband Russell Griswold Colt and their three children, circa 1914.]][[Winston Churchill]] was among the closest of many of Barrymore's dear friends. Some have claimed Churchill proposed to her in 1900; however, Barrymore mentions no such thing in her autobiography, ''Memories.'' She had, at the age of 19, while on tour in England, been rumored to be engaged to the [[William Montagu, 9th Duke of Manchester|Duke of Manchester]], actor [[Gerald Du Maurier]], writer [[Richard Harding Davis]] and the aforementioned Churchill.<ref>''Great Stars of the American Stage'' by Daniel Blum c.1952 Profile #56</ref>  

Ethel Barrymore married [[Russell Griswold Colt]] (1882<U+2013>1959), grandnephew of American arms maker [[Samuel Colt]] (1814<U+2013>1862), on March 14, 1909. The couple had been introduced, according to Barrymore's autobiography, when Colt had strolled by the table where she was having lunch with her uncle, actor John (Jack) Drew, in Sherry's Restaurant in New York.<ref>''Memories: An Autobiography by Ethel Barrymore.'' (Harper and Brothers, 1955, page 162.)</ref> A ''New York Times'' article of 1911, when Barrymore first took preliminary divorce measures against Colt, states that Colt had been introduced to Barrymore by her brother John Barrymore while Colt was still a student at Yale.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E4D71431E233A2575BC0A9619C946096D6CF New York Times; Saturday July 8, 1911: "ETHEL BARRYMORE TO SUE FOR DIVORCE;Papers in Suit Against Russell G. Colt on Way from Los Angeles by Messenger"](full article is in PDF click "View Full Article")</ref>  The couple had three children: actress/singer Ethel Barrymore Colt (1912<U+2013>1977), who appeared on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]''; Samuel Colt (1909<U+2013>1986); and John Drew Colt (1913<U+2013>1975). 

Barrymore's marriage to Colt was a precarious one from the start, with Barrymore filing divorce papers as early in the marriage as 1911, much to Colt's surprise. At least one source claims that Colt abused her and also that he fathered a child with another woman while married to Barrymore. They divorced in 1923 and, quite surprisingly, she did not seek alimony from Colt, which was her right. 

Ethel Barrymore never remarried. She had platonic relationships with other men, most notably actors [[Henry Daniell]] and [[Louis Calhern]].

==Death==
Ethel Barrymore died of cardiovascular disease in 1959, at her home in [[Hollywood, California]], after having lived for many years with a heart condition. She was two months shy of her 80th birthday. She was entombed at [[Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles|Calvary Cemetery]]. The [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]] in [[New York City]] is named after her.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0815.html</ref>
