'''Princess Antonia of Luxembourg''' (Antoinette Roberte Sophie Wilhelmine; 7 October 1899 <U+2013> 31 July 1954)<ref name="Luxemburg Genealogy">[http://pages.prodigy.net/ptheroff/gotha/luxemburg.html Luxemburg Genealogy]. Paul Theroff.  Retrieved on 2 July 2006.</ref> was a member of the [[Luxembourg]]ish [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]] and the wife of the [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Prince Rupprecht]], the last [[Crown Prince]] of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. Through her marriage, she was considered by some [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] as the [[Jacobite consorts|rightful Queen Consort]] of [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and [[France]] from 1921 to 1954.

==Family==
Born at [[Hohenburg Castle]],<ref name="Luxemburg Genealogy" /> in [[Upper Bavaria]], Antonia was the fourth daughter of [[Guillaume IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], who reigned between 1905 and 1912, and [[Marie Anne of Portugal|Marie Anne]], a princess of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[House of Braganza]].  Her maternal grandparents were [[Miguel of Portugal]] and [[Adelaide of L<U+00F6>wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg]].

She was the younger sister of two successive Grand Duchesses: [[Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de]] and [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Charlotte]].  In the family she was called "Toni".

==Marriage and children==
Antonia became the second wife of [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria]].  The two were engaged on 26 August 1918.<ref>Thewes (2003), p.74</ref>  At the time, Rupprecht was ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' in the Imperial German army, and had successfully commanded the [[German Sixth Army]] at the [[Battle of Lorraine]].  This led to criticism of the close ties between the Luxembourgian [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg|Grand Ducal Family]] and the royalty of the [[German Empire]] at a time when [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I|Luxembourg was occupied by Germany]].  This added to the pressure already on Grand Duchess Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, who was forced to abdicate on 10 January 1919.<ref>Thewes (2003), p.86</ref>  Despite the abdication of her elder sister, and the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in favour of a [[republic]], the two were married on 7 April 1921 at Hohenburg Castle.

As opponents of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]], Antonia and Rupprecht were forced into exile in [[Italy]] in 1939.  From here, they moved to [[Hungary]].  When Germany occupied Hungary in October 1944, Antonia and her children were captured, while Rupprecht, still in Italy, evaded arrest.  They were imprisoned at [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]].  In early April 1945, they were moved to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Although liberated that same month, the imprisonment greatly impaired Antonia's health, and she died nine years later, at [[Lenzerheide]], [[Switzerland]].<ref name="Luxemburg Genealogy" />

Antonia and Rupprecht had the following children:
* Prince Heinrich Franz Wilhelm of Bavaria (1922<U+2013>1958). Married Anne Marie de Lustrac (1927<U+2013>1999). No issue.
* [[Princess Irmingard of Bavaria|Princess Irmingard Marie Josefa of Bavaria]] (1923<U+2013>2010). Married her cousin [[Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (1913<U+2013>2008)|Prince Ludwig of Bavaria]] (1913<U+2013>2008) and has issue.
* Princess Editha Marie Gabrielle Anna of Bavaria (born 1924). Married first Tito Tommaso Maria Brunetti (1905<U+2013>1954) and second Prof. Gustav Christian Schimert (1910<U+2013>1990). Has issue by both.
* Princess Hilda Hildegard Marie Gabriele of Bavaria (1926<U+2013>2002). Married Juan Bradstock Edgar Lockett de Loayza (1912<U+2013>1987) and has issue.
* Princess Gabriele Adelgunde Marie Theresia Antonia of Bavaria (born 1927). Married Carl, Duke of [[Cro<U+00FF>]], Lord of D<U+00FC>lmen, and has issue.
* Princess Sophie Marie Therese of Bavaria (born 1935). Married Jean-Engelbert, Prince and Duke of [[Arenberg]] and has issue.
