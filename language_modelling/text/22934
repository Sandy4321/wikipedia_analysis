'''James II''' ([[14 October]] [[1633]] &ndash; [[16 September]] [[1701]])<ref>An assertion found in many sources that James II died [[6 September]] [[1701]] ([[17 September]] [[1701]] [[New Style]]) may result from a miscalculation done by an author of anonymous "An Exact Account of the Sickness and Death of the Late King James II, as also of the Proceedings at St. Germains thereupon, 1701, in a letter from an English gentleman in France to his friend in London" (Somers Tracts, ed. 1809<U+2013>1815, XI, pp. 339<U+2013>342). The account reads: "And on Friday the 17th instant, about three in the afternoon, the king died, the day he always fasted in memory of our blessed Saviour's passion, the day he ever desired to die on, and the ninth hour, according to the Jewish account, when our Saviour was crucified." As [[17 September]] [[1701]] [[New Style]] falls on a Saturday and the author insists that James died on Friday, "the day he ever desired to die on", an inevitable conclusion is that the author miscalculated the date which later made it to various reference works. See "English Historical Documents 1660<U+2013>1714", ed. by Andrew Browning (London and New York: Routledge, 2001), 136<U+2013>138.</ref> was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], [[List of monarchs of Scotland|King of Scots]],<ref name=james7>In Scotland, he was called '''James VII,''' as there were six previous kings of that nation named James.</ref> and [[King of Ireland]] from [[6 February]] [[1685]] to 11 December 1688.  He was the last [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] monarch to reign over the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].  Many of his subjects distrusted his religious policies and autocratic tendencies, leading a group of them to depose him in the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.  He was replaced not by his Roman Catholic son, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]], but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[William III of England|William III]], who became joint rulers in 1689.  James made one serious attempt to recover his crowns, when he landed in Ireland in 1689.  After his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in the summer of 1690, James returned to [[France]], living out the rest of his life under the protection of his cousin and ally, [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]].  

James is best known for his belief in [[absolute monarchy]] and his attempts to create [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]] for his subjects.  Both of these went against the wishes of the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and of most of his subjects.   Parliament, opposed to the growth of absolutism that was occurring in other European countries, as well as to the loss of legal supremacy for the [[Church of England]], saw their opposition as a way to preserve traditional English liberties.  This tension made James's three-year reign a struggle for supremacy between the Parliament and the crown, resulting in his ouster, the passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights]], and the [[Act of Settlement 1701|Hanoverian succession]].

==Birth and early life==
[[Image:Charles I and James II.png|235px|left|thumb|The future James II with his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]]]James, the second surviving son of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France]], was born at [[St. James's Palace]] on [[14 October]] [[1633]].<ref>Miller, 1</ref>  Later that same year, James was baptized by [[William Laud]], the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=callow31>Callow, 31</ref>  James was educated by tutors, along with his brother, the future [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and the two sons of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George]] and Francis Villiers.<ref>Callow, 34</ref>  At the age of three, James was appointed [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]; the position was initially honorary, but would become a substantive office after the Restoration, when James was an adult.<ref>Miller, 10; Callow, 101</ref>

===Civil War===
James was invested with the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1642,<ref>Callow, 36</ref> and created [[Duke of York]] in 1644.<ref name=callow31/>  As the King's disputes with the [[English Parliament]] grew into the [[English Civil War]] James stayed in [[Oxford]], a Royalist stronghold.<ref>Callow, 42; Miller, 3</ref>  When the city surrendered after the [[siege of Oxford]] in 1646, Parliamentary leaders ordered the Duke of York to be confined in [[St. James's Palace]].<ref>Callow, 45</ref>  In 1648, he escaped from the Palace and from there he went to [[The Hague]] in disguise.<ref>Callow, 48<U+2013>50</ref>  When Charles I was executed by the rebels in 1649, monarchists proclaimed James's older brother, [[Charles II of England|Charles]], as King Charles II.<ref name=royle517>Royle, 517</ref>  Charles II was recognized by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the [[Parliament of Ireland]], and was crowned [[King of Scots]] at [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]], in Scotland in 1651.  Although he was proclaimed King at [[Jersey]], Charles was unable to secure the [[crown of England]], and consequently fled to [[France]] and exile.<ref name=royle517/>

===Exile in France===
[[Image:Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne-Bouillon.jpg|right|thumb|Turenne, James's commander in France]]Like his brother, James sought refuge in France, serving in the French army under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] against the [[Fronde]], and later against their Spanish allies.<ref name=miller16>Miller, 16<U+2013>17</ref> In the French army, James had his first true experience of battle where, according to one observer, he "ventures himself and chargeth gallantly where anything is to be done".<ref name=miller16/>  In 1656, when his brother, Charles, entered into an alliance with [[Spain]]&mdash;an enemy of France&mdash;James was expelled from France and forced to leave Turenne's army.  James quarrelled with his brother over the diplomatic choice of Spain over France.  Exiled and poor, there was little that either Charles or James could do about the larger diplomatic situation, and James ultimately travelled to [[Bruges]] and (along with his younger brother, [[Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester|Henry]]) joined the Spanish army under [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond<U+00E9>|Louis, Prince of Cond<U+00E9>]], fighting against his former French comrades at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]].<ref>Miller, 19<U+2013>25</ref>  During his term of service in the Spanish army, James became friendly with two Irish Catholic brothers in the Royalist entourage, [[Archbishop Peter Talbot|Peter]] and [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Richard Talbot]], and began to be somewhat estranged from his brother's Anglican advisers.<ref>Miller, 22<U+2013>23</ref>  In 1659, the French and Spanish [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|made peace]].  James, doubtful of his brother's chances of regaining the throne, considered taking a Spanish offer to be an admiral in their navy.<ref>Miller, 24</ref>  Ultimately, he declined and by the next year the situation in England had sufficiently changed, and Charles II was crowned in London.<ref>Miller, 25</ref>

==Restoration==
===Marriage===
[[Image:James II and Anne Hyde.png|250px|thumb|James and Anne Hyde in the 1660s, by Sir [[Peter Lely]]]]After [[Oliver Cromwell|Oliver Cromwell's]] death in 1658 and the subsequent collapse of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] in 1660, Charles II was restored to the English throne.  Although James was the [[heir-presumptive]], it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children.<ref>Callow, 89</ref>  Upon his brother's restoration, James was created [[Duke of Albany]] in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York.  Upon his return to England, James produced an immediate controversy by announcing his engagement to [[Anne Hyde]], the daughter of Charles's chief minister, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]].<ref>Callow, 90</ref>  In 1659, while attempting to seduce her, James promised he would marry Anne.<ref>Miller, 44</ref>  Anne became pregnant in 1660, but following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] and James's return to power, no one at the royal court expected a prince to marry a commoner, no matter what he had pledged beforehand.<ref name=miller44>Miller, 44<U+2013>45</ref>  Although nearly everyone, including Anne's father, urged the two not to marry, they did so.<ref name=miller44/>  The couple was married secretly, then went through an official marriage ceremony on [[3 September]] [[1660]], in [[London]].  Their first child, Charles, was born less than two months later, but died in infancy, as did five further sons and daughters.<ref name=miller44/>  Only two daughters survived: [[Mary II of England|Mary]] (born [[30 April]] [[1662]]) and [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]] (born [[6 February]] [[1665]]).<ref>Waller, 49<U+2013>50</ref>  [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote that James was fond of his children and his role as a father, writing that he played with them "like an ordinary father," a contrast to the distant parenting common to royals at the time.<ref>Miller, 46</ref>  James's wife was devoted to him and influenced many of his decisions.<ref>Miller, 45<U+2013>46</ref>  Even so, he kept a variety of mistresses, including [[Arabella Churchill (royal mistress)|Arabella Churchill]] and [[Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester|Catherine Sedley]], and was reputed to be "the most unguarded ogler of his time."<ref>Miller, 46.  [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded in his diary that James "did eye my wife mightily." Ibid.  James's taste in women was often maligned, with [[Gilbert Burnet]] famously remarking that James's mistresses must have been "given him by his priests as a penance."  Miller, 59.</ref>  Anne Hyde died in 1671.

===Military and political offices===
After the Restoration, James was confirmed as [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]], an office that carried with it the subsidiary appointments of Governor of [[Portsmouth]] and [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]].<ref>Callow, 101</ref>  James commanded the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665&ndash;1667) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672&ndash;1674). Following the [[raid on the Medway]] in 1667, James oversaw the survey and re-fortification of the southern coast.<ref>Callow, 104</ref>  The office of Lord High Admiral, combined with his revenue from [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|post office]] and wine tariffs (granted him by Charles upon his restoration) gave James a sufficient salary to keep a sizeable court household.<ref>Miller, 42</ref> 

Following its capture by the English in 1664, the Dutch territory of [[New Netherland]] was named New York in James's honour. After the founding, the duke gave the colony to proprieters, George Carteret and John Lord Berkeley.  [[Fort Orange]], 240 kilometres (150 miles) north on the [[Hudson River]], was renamed [[Albany, New York|Albany]] after James's Scottish title.<ref name=miller44/>  In 1683, he became the governor of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], but did not take an active role in its governance.<ref name=miller44/>  James also headed the [[Royal African Company]], which participated in the [[slave trade]].<ref>Miller, 43<U+2013>44</ref>

===Conversion to Catholicism===
[[Image:Mary of modena lg.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mary of Modena]], James's second wife]]James's time in France had exposed him to Catholicism and he and his wife, Anne, became drawn to that faith.<ref>Miller, 58<U+2013>59; Callow, 144<U+2013>145.  Callow writes that Anne "made the greatest single impact upon his thinking" and that she converted shortly after the Restoration, "almost certainly before her husband."  Ibid., 144.</ref>  James took [[Eucharist|Communion]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in about 1668 or 1669, although his conversion was kept secret for some time and he continued to attend Anglican services until 1676.<ref>Callow, 143<U+2013>144; Waller, 135</ref>  In spite of his conversion, James continued to associate primarily with Anglicans, including [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]] and [[George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth|George Legge]], as well as [[Huguenot|French Protestants]], such as [[Louis de Duras, 2nd Earl of Feversham|Louis de Duras]], the Earl of Feversham.<ref>Callow, 149</ref>

Growing fears of Catholic influence at court led Parliament to introduce a new [[Test Act]] in 1673.<ref name=miller69>Miller, 69<U+2013>71</ref> Under this Act, all civil and military officials were required to take an oath (in which they were required not only to disavow the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], but also denounce certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church as "superstitious and idolatrous") and to receive communion under the auspices of the [[Church of England]].<ref>Kenyon, 385</ref> James refused to perform both actions, instead choosing to relinquish the post of Lord High Admiral.  His conversion to Catholicism was thereby made public.<ref name=miller69/>

Charles II opposed the conversion, ordering that James's daughters, Mary and Anne, be raised as Protestants.<ref>Waller, 92</ref>  Nevertheless, in 1673, he allowed James to marry the Catholic [[Mary of Modena]], a fifteen-year-old Italian princess.<ref>Waller, 16<U+2013>17</ref>  Many of the English, distrustful of Catholicism, regarded the new Duchess of York as an agent of the [[Pope Clement X|Pope]].<ref>Waller, 30<U+2013>31</ref>

===Exclusion Crisis===
In 1677, James reluctantly consented to his daughter Mary's marriage to the Protestant Prince of Orange, [[William III of England|William III]] (who was also James's nephew,) acquiescing after Charles and William had agreed upon the marriage.<ref>Miller, 84; Waller, 94<U+2013>97.  According to Miller, James's reaction to the agreement was "The King shall be obeyed."  Miller, 84.</ref>  Despite the Protestant marriage, fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]], to produce any children.  A defrocked Anglican clergyman, [[Titus Oates]], spoke of a "[[Popish Plot]]" to kill Charles and put the Duke of York on the throne.<ref>Miller, 87</ref>  The fabricated plot caused a wave of anti-Catholic hysteria to sweep across the nation.  

[[Image:James Scott.jpg|right|thumb|The [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]] was involved in plots against James.]]In England, the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]], a former government minister and now a leading opponent of Catholicism, attempted to have James excluded from the line of succession.<ref>Miller, 99<U+2013>105</ref>  Some members of Parliament even proposed that the crown go to Charles's illegitimate son, [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth]].<ref>Harris, 74</ref>  In 1679, with the [[Exclusion Bill]] in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved  Parliament.<ref>Miller, 93<U+2013>95</ref>  Two further [[List of Parliaments of England|Parliaments]] were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason.<ref>Miller, 103<U+2013>104</ref>  The Exclusion Crisis contributed to the development of the English two-party system: the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] were those who supported the Bill, while the [[Tory|Tories]] were those who opposed it.  Ultimately, the succession was not altered, but James was convinced to withdraw from all policy-making bodies and to accept a lesser role in his brother's government.<ref>Miller, 90</ref> 

On the orders of the King, James left England for [[Brussels]].<ref>Miller, 87<U+2013>91</ref>  In 1680, he was appointed Lord High Commissioner of Scotland and took up his residence at the [[Holyrood Palace|Palace of Holyroodhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]]  to suppress an uprising and oversee royal government there.<ref>Miller, 95</ref>  James returned to England for a time when Charles was stricken ill and appeared to be near death.<ref>Miller, 98<U+2013>99</ref>  The hysteria of the accusations eventually faded, but James's relations with many in Parliament, including the [[Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds|Earl of Danby]], a former ally, were forever strained and a solid segment of Parliament was turned against him.<ref>Miller, 89; Callow, 180<U+2013>183</ref>

===Return to favour===
In 1683, a plot was uncovered to assassinate Charles and James and spark a [[republicanism|republican]] revolution to re-establish a government of the [[Commonwealth of England|Cromwellian style]].<ref name=miller115>Miller, 115<U+2013>116</ref>  This conspiracy, known as the [[Rye House Plot]], backfired upon its conspirators and provoked a wave of sympathy for the King and James.<ref>Miller, 116; Waller, 142<U+2013>143</ref>  Several notable [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], including the [[Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and the King's illegitimate son, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], were implicated.<ref name=miller115/>  Monmouth initially confessed to complicity in the plot, implicating fellow-plotters, but later recanted.<ref name=miller115/>  Essex committed suicide and Monmouth and several others were obliged to flee into continental exile.<ref>Miller, 116<U+2013>117</ref>  Charles reacted to the plot by increasing repression of Whigs and dissenters.<ref name=miller115/>  Taking advantage of James's rebounding popularity, Charles invited him back onto the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|privy council]] in 1684.<ref>Miller, 117</ref>  While some in Parliament remained wary of the possibility of a Catholic king, the threat of excluding James from the throne had passed.

==Reign==
===Ascension to the throne===
[[Image:James II statue 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of James II in [[Trafalgar Square]], London]]Charles died in 1685 after converting to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed.<ref>Miller, 118<U+2013>119</ref>  Having no legitimate children, Charles was succeeded by his brother James, who reigned in England and Ireland as James II, and in Scotland as James VII.  There was no initial opposition to James's succession, and there were widespread reports of public rejoicing at the orderly succession.<ref name=miller120>Miller, 120<U+2013>121</ref>  James wanted to proceed quickly to the coronation, and was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on [[23 April]] [[1685]].<ref>Harris, 45.  The English coronation only crowned James King of England and Ireland; James was never crowned in Scotland, but was proclaimed King there around the same time.</ref>  The new [[List of Parliaments of England#Parliaments of James II|Parliament]] that assembled in May 1685 was initially favourable to James, and the new King sent word that even most of the former exclusionists would be forgiven if they acquiesced to his rule.<ref name=miller120/>  Most of Charles's officers continued in office, the exceptions being the promotion of James's brothers-in-law, the Earls of [[Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] and [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Rochester]], and the demotion of [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Halifax]].<ref>Miller, 121</ref>  Parliament granted James a generous life income, including all of the proceeds of [[tonnage and poundage]] and the [[customs]] duties.<ref>Harris, 44<U+2013>45</ref>  James worked harder as king than his brother had, but was less willing to compromise when his advisers disagreed.<ref>Miller, 123</ref>

===Two rebellions===
Soon after becoming king, James faced a [[Monmouth Rebellion|rebellion]] in southern England led by his nephew, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], and another rebellion in Scotland led by [[Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll|Archibald Campbell]], the [[Earl of Argyll]].<ref>Miller, 140<U+2013>143; Harris, 73<U+2013>86</ref>  Argyll and Monmouth both began their expeditions from the Netherlands, where James's nephew, William III, had neglected to detain them or put a stop to their recruitment efforts.<ref>Miller, 139<U+2013>140</ref>  Argyll sailed to Scotland and, on arriving there, raised recruits mainly from amongst his own clan, the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]].<ref name=harris75>Harris, 75<U+2013>76</ref>  The rebellion was quickly crushed, and Argyll himself was captured at [[Inchinnan]] on [[18 June]] [[1685]].<ref name=harris75/>  Having arrived with fewer than 300 men and unable to convince many more to flock to his standard, Argyll never posed a credible threat to James.<ref>Harris, 76</ref>  He was executed 
on [[30 June]] in [[Edinburgh]].

Argyll's rebellion was coordinated with Monmouth's, but the latter was more dangerous to James.  Monmouth proclaimed himself King at [[Lyme Regis]] on [[11 June]].<ref>Harris, 82<U+2013>85</ref>  He attempted to raise recruits but was unable to gather enough rebels to defeat even James's small standing army.<ref name=miller141>Miller, 141</ref>  Monmouth attacked the King's forces at night, in an attempt at surprise, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]].<ref name=miller141/>  The King's forces, led by Feversham and Churchill, quickly dispersed the ill-prepared rebels.<ref name=miller141/>  Monmouth himself was captured and executed at the [[Tower of London]] on [[15 July]].<ref>Harris, 88</ref>  The King's judges&mdash;most notably, [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|George Jeffreys]]&mdash;condemned many of the rebels to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] and [[Indentured servant#The Caribbean|indentured servitude]] in the [[West Indies]] in a series of trials that came to be known as the [[Bloody Assizes]].<ref>Miller, 141<U+2013>142</ref>  Some 250 of the rebels were executed.<ref>Harris, 88</ref>  While both rebellions were defeated easily enough, the effect on James was to harden his resolve against his enemies and to increase his suspicion of the Dutch.<ref>Miller, 142</ref>

===Absolutism and religious liberty===
To protect himself from further rebellions, James sought safety in an enlarged [[standing army]].<ref name=miller142>Miller, 142<U+2013>143</ref>  This alarmed his subjects, not only because of the trouble soldiers caused in the towns, but because it was against the English tradition to keep a professional army in peacetime.<ref>Harris, 95<U+2013>100</ref>  Even more alarming to Parliament was James's use of his [[Royal Prerogative|dispensing power]] to allow Roman Catholics to command several regiments without having to take the oath mandated by the Test Act.<ref name=miller142/>  When even the previously supportive Parliament objected to these measures, James ordered Parliament [[Parliamentary session|prorogued]] in November 1685, never to meet again in his reign.<ref>Miller, 146<U+2013>147</ref>

Religious tension grew from 1686.  James allowed Roman Catholics to occupy the highest offices of the Kingdoms, and received at his court the [[papal nuncio]], [[Ferdinando d'Adda]], the first representative from Rome to London since the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].<ref name=miller142/> James's [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] confessor, [[Edward Petre]], was a particular object of Protestant ire.<ref>Harris, 195<U+2013>196</ref>  When the King's Secretary of State, the [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland|Earl of Sunderland]], began replacing office-holders at court with Catholic favourites, James began to lose the confidence of many of his Anglican supporters.<ref name=miller150>Miller, 150<U+2013>152</ref>  Sunderland's purge of office-holders even extended to the King's Anglican brothers-in-law and their supporters.<ref name=miller150/>

In 1687, James issued the [[Declaration of Indulgence]], also known as the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, in which he used his  [[Royal Prerogative|suspending power]] to negate the effect of laws punishing Roman Catholics and Protestant [[English Dissenters|dissenters]].<ref>Kenyon, 389<U+2013>391</ref>   James ordered the Declaration read from the pulpits of every Anglican church, further alienating the Anglican bishops against the Catholic head of their church.<ref name=harris216>Harris, 216<U+2013>224</ref>  While the Declaration elicited some thanks from Catholics and dissenters, it left the Established Church, the traditional ally of the monarchy, in the difficult position of being forced to erode its own privileges.<ref name=harris216/>  The King provoked further opposition by attempting to reduce the Anglican monopoly on education.<ref name=harris224>Harris, 224<U+2013>229</ref>   At the [[University of Oxford]], James offended Anglicans by allowing Catholics to hold important positions in [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] and [[University College, Oxford|University College]], two of Oxford's largest colleges.  He also attempted to force the Protestant Fellows of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] to elect [[Anthony Farmer]], a man of generally ill repute who was believed to be secretly Catholic,<ref name=farmer>Farmer's exact religious affiliation is unclear.  Macaulay, at 190, says Farmer "pretended to turn Papist."  Prall, at 148, calls him a "Catholic sympathizer."  Miller, at 170, says "although he had not declared himself a Catholic, it was believed he was no longer an Anglican."  Ashley, at 89, does not refer to Farmer by name, but only as the King's Catholic nominee.  All sources agree that Farmer's bad reputation as a "person of scandalous character" was as much a deterrent to his nomination as his uncertain religious loyalties.  See, e.g., Prall, 148.</ref> as their president when the Protestant incumbent died, a violation of the Fellows' right to elect a candidate of their own choosing.<ref name=harris224/>

[[Image:William III of England.jpg|thumb|left|James's nephew, [[William III of England|William]], was invited to "save the Protestant religion".]]In April 1688, James re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, subsequently ordering Anglican clergymen to read it in their churches.<ref>Harris, 258<U+2013>259</ref>  When the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Sancroft]] and six other bishops (known as the [[Seven Bishops]]) submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King's religious policies, they were arrested and tried for [[seditious libel]].<ref>Harris, 260<U+2013>262; Prall, 312</ref>  Public alarm increased when Queen Mary gave birth to a Catholic son and heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]] on [[10 June]] of that year.<ref>Miller 186<U+2013>187; Harris, 269<U+2013>272</ref>  When James's only possible successors were his two Protestant daughters, moderate Anglicans could see his pro-Catholic policies as a temporary aberration; the Prince's birth opened the possibility of a permanent Catholic dynasty, and led such men to reconsider their patience.<ref name=harris271>Harris, 271<U+2013>272; Ashley, 110<U+2013>111</ref>  Threatened by a Catholic dynasty, several influential Protestants claimed the child was "suppositious".  They had already entered into negotiations with William, Prince of Orange, when it became known the Queen was pregnant, and the birth of James's son reinforced their convictions.<ref>Waller, 43<U+2013>46; Miller, 186<U+2013>187</ref>

[[Image:John Churchill in his thirties.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|John Churchill]] had been a member of James's household for many years, but defected to William of Orange in 1688.]]On [[30 June]] [[1688]], a group of Protestant nobles, later known as the [[Immortal Seven]], invited the Prince of Orange to come to [[England]] with an army.<ref>Ashley, 201<U+2013>202</ref>  By September, it had become clear that William sought to invade.<ref name=miller190>Miller, 190<U+2013>196</ref> Believing that his own army would be adequate, James refused the assistance of Louis XIV, fearing that the English would oppose French intervention.<ref name=miller190/>  When William arrived on [[5 November]] [[1688]], many Protestant officers, including Churchill, defected and joined William, as did James's own daughter, Princess [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]].<ref>Waller, 236<U+2013>239</ref>  James lost his nerve, and declined to attack the invading army, despite his own numerical superiority.<ref>Miller, 201<U+2013>203</ref>   On [[11 December]], James attempted to flee to [[France]], first throwing the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] into the [[River Thames]].<ref name=miller205>Miller, 205<U+2013>209</ref>   He was captured in [[Kent]]; he was released and afterwards placed under Dutch protective guard.  Having no desire to make James a martyr, the Prince of Orange let him escape on [[23 December]].<ref name=miller205/>  James was received by his cousin and ally, Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a pension.

William convened a [[Convention Parliament]] to decide how to handle James's flight.  While the Parliament refused to depose him, they declared that James, having fled to France and dropped the Great Seal into the Thames, had effectively [[abdication|abdicated]] the throne, and that the throne had thereby become vacant.<ref>Miller, 209.  Harris, 320<U+2013>328, analyses the legal nature of the abdication; James did not agree that he had abdicated.</ref>  To fill this vacancy, James's daughter Mary was declared Queen; she was to rule jointly with her husband William, who would be King.  The [[Parliament of Scotland]] followed suit on [[11 April]] [[1689]].<ref>Harris, 402<U+2013>407</ref>  The Parliament passed a [[Bill of Rights]] that charged James II with abusing his power; amongst other things, it criticised the suspension of the Test Acts, the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for merely petitioning the crown, the establishment of a standing army and the imposition of cruel punishments.<ref>Ashley, 206<U+2013>209; Harris, 329<U+2013>348</ref>  The Bill also stipulated that no Catholic would henceforth be permitted to ascend to the English throne, nor could any English monarch marry a Catholic.<ref>Harris, 349<U+2013>350</ref>

==Later years==
===War in Ireland===
With the assistance of French troops, James landed in Ireland in March 1689.<ref>Miller, 222<U+2013>224</ref>  The [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] did not follow the example of the English Parliament; it declared that James remained King and passed a massive [[bill of attainder]] against those who had rebelled against him.<ref>Miller, 226<U+2013>227</ref>  At James's urging, the Irish Parliament passed an Act for Liberty of Conscience that granted religious freedom to all Catholics and Protestants in Ireland.<ref>Harris, 440</ref>  James worked to build an army in Ireland, but was ultimately defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] on [[1 July]] [[1690]] when William arrived, personally leading an army to defeat James and reassert English control.<ref name=harris446>Harris, 446<U+2013>449</ref>  James fled to France once more, departing from [[Kinsale]], never to return to any of his former kingdoms.<ref name=harris446/>

===Return to exile===
[[Image:Ch<U+00E2>teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye01.jpg|thumb|The [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], James's home during his final exile]]In France, James was allowed to live in the royal ch<U+00E2>teau of [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].<ref>Miller, 235</ref>  The Queen and some of his supporters fled with him, including the [[John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort|Earl of Melfort]]; most, but not all, were Catholic.<ref>Miller, 235<U+2013>236</ref>  Some supporters in England attempted to restore James to the throne by assassinating William III in 1696, but the plot failed and the backlash made James's cause less popular.<ref>Miller, 238; Waller, 350</ref>  Louis XIV's offer to have James elected [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|King of Poland]] in the same year was rejected, for James feared that acceptance of the Polish crown might (in the minds of the English people) render him incapable of being King of England.  After Louis concluded peace with William in 1697, he ceased to offer much in the way of assistance to James.<ref>Miller, 239</ref>

During his last years, James lived as an austere [[penitent]].<ref>Miller, 234<U+2013>236</ref>  He died of a [[brain hemorrhage]] on [[16 September]] [[1701]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].<ref name=miller240>Miller, 240</ref> His body was laid to rest in a coffin at the Chapel of Saint Edmund in the Church of the English Benedictines in the Rue St. Jacques, Paris.<ref name=miller240/>  In 1734, the [[Archbishop of Paris]] heard evidence to support James's canonization, but nothing came of it.<ref name=miller240/>  During the [[French Revolution]], James's tomb was raided and his remains scattered.<ref>Miller, 240; Waller, 401; MacLeod, 349.  MacLeod and Waller say all of James's remains were lost.  [http://jacobite.ca/gazetteer/France/SaintGermain.htm McFerran] says parts of his bowel sent to the parish church of St. Germain-en-Laye were rediscovered in 1824 and are the only known remains left.  The ''English Illustrated Magazine'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=I4oX7koMPh8C&pg=PA592&lpg=PA592&dq=parish+church+%22saint+germain+en+laye%22&source=web&ots=40cIBlBhmE&sig=h8QKaqjxgMhi2sp2UtW5qEYpwxE article] on St. Germain from September 1901 concurs.</ref>

==Succession==
[[Image:Pretend3.jpeg|thumb|left|140px|[[James Francis Edward Stuart|James's son]] was known as "James III and VIII" to his supporters, and "The Old Pretender" to his enemies.]]James's younger daughter [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]] succeeded to the throne when William III died in 1702.  The [[Act of Settlement 1701]] provided that, if the line of succession established in the Bill of Rights were to be extinguished, then the crown would go to a German cousin, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], and to her Protestant heirs.<ref name=harris493>Harris, 493</ref>  Thus, when Anne died in 1714 (fewer than two months after the death of Sophia), the crown was inherited by [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], Sophia's son, the Elector of Hanover and Anne's second cousin.<ref name=harris493/>

James's son [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis Edward]] was recognised as King at his father's death by Louis XIV of France and James's remaining supporters (later known as [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]]s) as "James III and VIII."<ref>MacLeod, 349</ref>   He led a [[Jacobite Rising#The 'Fifteen'|rising]] in Scotland in 1715 shortly after George I's accession, but was defeated.<ref>MacLeod 361<U+2013>363</ref>  Jacobites [[Jacobite Rising#The 'Forty-Five'|rose again]] in 1745 led by [[Charles Edward Stuart]], James II's grandson, and were again defeated.<ref>MacLeod, 365<U+2013>371</ref>  Since then, no serious attempt to restore the Stuart heir has been made.  Charles's claims passed to his younger brother [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], the [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>MacLeod, 371<U+2013>372</ref>  Henry was the last of James II's legitimate descendants, and no relative has publicly acknowledged the [[Jacobite succession|Jacobite claim]] since then.<ref>MacLeod, 373<U+2013>374</ref>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

==Historiography==
[[Image:Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay - Project Gutenberg eText 13103.jpg|right|thumb|140px|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay]] wrote in the [[Whiggish historiography|Whiggish]] tradition.]]
Historical analysis of James II has gone through considerable change since he was overthrown.  Initially, [[Whiggish historiography|Whiggish]] historians, led by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Lord Macaulay]], cast James as a cruel absolutist and his reign as "tyranny which approached to insanity."<ref>Macaulay, 239</ref>  Subsequent scholars, such as [[G. M. Trevelyan]] and David Ogg, while more balanced than Macaulay, continued Macaulay's tradition into the twentieth century, characterizing James as a tyrant, his attempts at religious tolerance as a fraud, and his reign as an aberration in the course of British history.<ref>See Prall, vii-xv, for a more detailed historiography.</ref>  In 1892, [[A. W. Ward]] wrote for the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] that James was "obviously a political and religious bigot", although never devoid of "a vein of patriotic sentiment"; "his conversion to the church of Rome made the emancipation of his fellow-catholics in the first instance, and the recovery of England for catholicism in the second, the governing objects of his policy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ia310903.us.archive.org/0/items/dictionaryofnati29stepuoft/dictionaryofnati29stepuoft.pdf|title=James II of England|accessdate=2007-10-17|author=Sidney Lee, editor|year = 1892|work = Dictionary of National Biography|publisher = MacMillan & Co.|pages = 197}}</ref>

[[Image:HilaireBelloc.jpeg|140px|thumb|left|[[Hilaire Belloc|Belloc]] was a notable apologist for James II.]]
[[Hilaire Belloc]] broke with this tradition in 1928.  Belloc cast James as an honorable man and a true advocate for freedom of conscience, and his enemies as "men in the small clique of great fortunes ... which destroyed the ancient monarchy of the English."<ref>Belloc, vii</ref>  Belloc's thesis failed to alter the course of historical opinion at the time, but by the 1960s and 1970s, the works of Maurice Ashley and Stuart Prall began to reconsider James's motives in granting religious toleration, while still taking note of James's autocratic rule.<ref>See Ashley, 196<U+2013>198; Prall, 291<U+2013>293</ref>  These modern authors moved away from the school of thought that preached inevitability of the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the continuous march of progress and democracy.  "[H]istory is," Ashley wrote, "after all, the story of human beings and individuals, as well as of the classes and the masses."<ref name=ashley9>Ashley, 9</ref>  He cast James II and William III as "men of ideals as well as human weaknesses."<ref name=ashley9/>  John Miller, writing in 2000, accepted the claims of James's absolutism, but argued that "his main concern was to secure religious liberty and civil equality for Catholics.  Any 'absolutist' methods ... were essentially means to that end."<ref>Miller, ix</ref>  In 2004, W. A. Speck wrote in the new [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] that "James was genuinely committed to religious toleration, but also sought to increase the power of the crown."<ref name=speck>W. A. Speck, "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14593 James II and VII (1633<U+2013>1701)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept. 2004; online edn, May 2006, accessed [[15 October]] [[2007]].  Speck elaborated that James "wished that all his subjects could be as convinced as he was that the Catholic church was the one true church. He was also convinced that the established church was maintained artificially by penal laws which proscribed nonconformity. If these were removed, and conversions to Catholicism were encouraged, then many would take place <U+2026> James underestimated the appeal of protestantism in general and the Church of England in particular. His was the zeal and even bigotry of a narrow-minded convert...."</ref>  He added that, unlike the government of the Netherlands, "James was too autocratic to combine freedom of conscience with popular government. He resisted any check on the monarch's power. That is why his heart was not in the concessions he had to make in 1688. He would rather live in exile with his principles intact than continue to reign as a limited monarch."<ref name=speck/>
Tim Harris's conclusions from his 2006 book summarize the crossroads of modern scholarship on James II:{{quote|The jury will doubtless remain out on James for a long time<U+2026>Was he an egotistical bigot<U+2026>a tyrant who rode roughshod over the will of the vast majority of his subjects (at least in England and Scotland)<U+2026>simply na<U+00EF>ve, or even perhaps plain stupid, unable to appreciate the realities of political power<U+2026>Or was he a well-intentioned and even enlightened ruler<U+2014>an enlightened despot well ahead of his time, perhaps<U+2014>who was merely trying to do what he thought was best for his subjects?<ref>Harris, 478<U+2013>479</ref>}}

===Styles===
The official style of James II was "James the Second, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[List of Monarchs of Scotland|Scotland]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]], etc." (The [[English claims to the French throne|claim to France]] was only nominal, and was asserted by every English King from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled.)

[[Image:James2coin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Half-Crown coin of James II, 1686]]James was created "[[Duke of Normandy]]" by King Louis XIV of France, [[December 31]] [[1660]]. This was a few months after the restoration of his brother [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to the English and Irish thrones (Charles II had been crowned King of Scotland in 1651), and probably was done as a political gesture of support for James - since his brother also would have claimed the title "Duke of Normandy."

===Arms===
His [[heraldry|arms]] as King were: ''Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for [[Coat of arms of England|England]]); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]])''.
