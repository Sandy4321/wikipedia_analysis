==College career==
Born in [[Beaumont, Texas]], Davis stayed in his hometown to play basketball for Lamar. He stands 6'8" and weighed 218&nbsp;pounds at his prime while playing the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position.<ref name=DRAFTREV>{{Cite web| title = B.B.

In [[1978<U+2013>79 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|1978<U+2013>79]], Davis' [[sophomore]] year, he had the best personal season of his career.<ref name=RETIRE/> He averaged 20.2 points and 10.8 rebounds per game while amassing 651 points and 344 rebounds. These figures still rank in Lamar's top ten and top five single season efforts, respectively.<ref name=RETIRE/> Behind the record of 23<U+2013>9 (9<U+2013>1), the Cardinals earned their first-ever berth into the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]].<ref name=RETIRE/> Ranked as the #10 seed in the Midwest Region, they defeated nationally-ranked and #7 seed [[Detroit Titans men's basketball|Detroit]], 95<U+2013>87, to advance to the second round. They then lost by 31 points to the eventual national champion [[1978<U+2013>79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State Spartans]] who were led by [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson]].

As a [[junior (education)|junior]] in [[1979<U+2013>80 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|1979<U+2013>80]], Davis averaged 16.5 points and 8.6 rebounds per game.<ref name=DRAFTREV/> Despite the dip in his statistics, he did record a career-high 2.5 blocks per game, and his 75 blocked shots set a still-standing single season school record.<ref name=RETIRE/> Lamar finished atop the Southland Conference yet again with a 22<U+2013>11 (8<U+2013>2) record, and for the second consecutive season earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament. As the #10 seed, they edged #7 [[Weber State Wildcats men's basketball|Weber State]], 87<U+2013>86, in the first round. Their second round opponent was the #2 seed and fourth-ranked team in the nation, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]].<ref name=RETIRE/> Lamar produced one of the biggest upsets of that year's tournament by defeating them, 81<U+2013>77, and advancing to their first-ever Sweet 16.<ref name=RETIRE/> The #6 seed [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson Tigers]] knocked the Cardinals out the next game, however, 74<U+2013>66, thus ending their season.

In his final [[1980<U+2013>81 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|season]], Davis' overall numbers were the lowest of his career.<ref name=DRAFTREV/> He still averaged 15.4 points and 8.1 rebounds per game for the year, but he appeared in just 20 games (seven fewer than his previous career-low).<ref name=DRAFTREV/> Despite this, Davis earned his third First Team All-Conference selection (he received Second Team honors as a junior) and he led the Cardinals to both the regular season and conference tournament championships, the latter being the first in school history.<ref name=ENCY/> Lamar finished 25<U+2013>5 (8<U+2013>2) and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament for a third straight year.<ref name=RETIRE/><ref name=ENCY/>

During Davis' four-year college career, he compiled career totals of 2,084 points and 1,122 rebounds in 119 games played.<ref>{{Cite web|title =Lamar University Cardinals Individual Career Records|publisher = Lamar University |year= 2008|url =http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lama/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/Career_Records.pdf |accessdate = August 22, 2011}}</ref> He is in an [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds|exclusive club]] of [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's basketball players to reach both milestones in a career.

The [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Sacramento Kings|Kansas City Kings]] selected him in the fourth round (82nd overall) in the [[1981 NBA Draft]], although Davis never played in the league.<ref>{{Cite web| title = 1981 NBA Draft| work = basketball-reference.com| publisher = Sports Reference LLC| year= 2011| url = http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1981.html| accessdate = August 22, 2011}}</ref>
