'''Anabolic steroids''' officially known as '''anabolic-androgenic steroids''' ('''AAS'''),  are drugs which mimic the effects of the [[androgen|male steroids]] [[testosterone]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]].  They increase [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] within cells, which results in the buildup of [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] ([[anabolism]]), especially in [[muscle]]s. Anabolic steroids also have [[androgen]]ic and [[virilization|virilizing]] properties, including the development and maintenance of [[Masculinity|masculine]] characteristics such as the growth of the [[vocal fold|vocal cords]] and body hair. The word ''anabolic'' comes from the Greek ''anabolein'', "to build up", and the word ''androgenic'' from the Greek ''andros'', "man" + ''genein'', "to produce".

Anabolic steroids were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in medicine to stimulate bone growth and appetite, induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. The [[American College of Sports Medicine]] acknowledges that AAS, in the presence of adequate diet, can contribute to increases in body weight, often as lean mass increases, and that the gains in muscular strength achieved through high-intensity exercise and proper diet can be additionally increased by the use of AAS in some individuals.<ref>Michael Powers, "Performance-Enhancing Drugs" in Joel Houglum, in Gary L. Harrelson, Deidre Leaver-Dunn, "Principles of Pharmacology for Athletic Trainers", SLACK Incorporated, 2005, ISBN 1-55642-594-5, p. 330</ref>

Some health risks can be produced by long-term use or excessive doses of anabolic steroids. These effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[low-density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[high-density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]], and dangerous changes in the structure of the [[left ventricle]] of the heart. 

[[Ergogenic aid|Ergogenic]] uses for anabolic steroids in sports and [[bodybuilding]] is controversial, because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain an advantage conventionally considered "cheating." Their use is referred to as [[Doping in sport|doping]] and banned by all major sporting bodies. For many years the AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in [[IOC]]-accredited laboratories.<ref name=hk515>Hartgens and Kuipers (2004), p. 515</ref><ref name=Kicman/> In countries where AAS are [[controlled substances]], there is often a [[black market]] in which smuggled or even [[counterfeit drugs]] are sold to users.

The use of [[gonadal]] [[steroid]]s pre-dates their identification and isolation. Medical use of [[testicle]] extract began in the late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhn CM |title=Anabolic steroids |journal=Recent Prog.

In the 1930s it was already known that the [[testes]] contained a more powerful [[androgen]] than [[androstenone]], and three groups of scientists, funded by competing [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the Netherlands, Nazi Germany and Switzerland, raced to isolate it.<ref name = "PMID7817189">{{cite journal

=== Development of synthetic AAS ===
[[Image:Metandienone.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of the synthetic steroid [[Methandrostenolone]] (Dianabol). 17<U+03B1>-methylation (upper right corner) enhances oral [[bioavailability]].]]

The development of muscle-building properties of testosterone was pursued in the 1940s, in the Soviet Union and in [[Eastern Bloc]] countries such as East Germany, where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and other [[amateur sports|amateur]] [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifters]]. In response to the success of Russian weightlifters, the U.S. Olympic Team physician Dr. [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] worked with synthetic chemists to develop an anabolic steroid with reduced [[Anabolic steroid#Anabolic and androgenic effects|androgenic]] effects.<ref name="pedsreview">{{cite journal |author=Calfee R, Fadale P |title=Popular ergogenic drugs and supplements in young athletes |journal=Pediatrics |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=e577<U+2013>89 |year=2006 |pmid=16510635 |doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1429}}</ref> Ziegler's work resulted in the production of [[methandrostenolone]], which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol. The new steroid was approved for use in the U.S. by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1958. It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly. The drug's [[off-label]] users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters. Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes, he soon discovered that those who abused Dianabol suffered from enlarged prostates and atrophied testes.<ref>Justin Peters [http://www.slate.com/id/2113752/ The Man Behind the Juice], ''Slate'' Friday, Feb. 18, 2005, Accessed 29 April 2008</ref> AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the IOC in 1976, and a decade later the committee introduced 'out-of-competition' doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition.<ref name=hk515/>

Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS: [[alkylation]] at 17-alpha position with [[methyl]] or [[ethyl]] group created orally active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver, [[esterification]] of testosterone and [[nortestosterone]] at the 17-beta position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months, and finally alterations of the ring structure were applied for both oral and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic to androgenic effect ratios.<ref>Hartgens and Kuipers (2004), p. 516</ref>

== Pharmacology ==
=== Routes of administration ===
[[Image:Depo-testosterone 200 mg ml.jpg|thumb|upright|A vial of injectable testosterone cypionate]]
There are three common forms in which anabolic steroids are administered: oral pills, injectable steroids, and skin patches. Oral administration is the most convenient. Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed, but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites, and only about 1/6 is available in active form. In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth, testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the 17 position, e.g. [[methyltestosterone]] and [[fluoxymesterone]]. This modification reduces the liver's ability to break down these compounds before they reach the systemic circulation.

Testosterone can be administered [[Route of administration#Parenteral by injection or infusion|parenterally]], but it has more prolonged absorption time and greater activity in [[propionate]], [[enanthate]], [[undecanoate]] or [[cypionate]] [[ester]] form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection.<ref name=Chr/> Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. [[Transdermal patch]]es (adhesive patches placed on the skin) may also be used to deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream. Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering anabolic steroids for non-medical purposes.<ref name="Cohen2007"/>

The traditional routes of administration do not have differential effects on the efficacy of the drug. Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of anabolic steroids are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as [[first-pass effect|first-pass metabolism]]. However, the orally available forms of AAS may cause [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] in high doses.<ref name=Kicman>{{cite journal |author=Kicman AT, Gower DB |title=Anabolic steroids in sport: biochemical, clinical and analytical perspectives |journal=Annals of clinical biochemistry |volume=40 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=321<U+2013>56 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12880534 |doi=10.1258/000456303766476977 |url=http://acb.rsmjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12880534}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal

As the name suggests, anabolic-androgenic steroids have two different, but overlapping, types of effects: ''anabolic'', meaning that they promote [[anabolism]] (cell growth), and ''[[androgen]]ic'' (or ''[[virilization|virilizing]]''), meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics.

Some examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] from [[amino acid]]s, increased appetite, increased bone remodeling and growth, and stimulation of [[bone marrow]], which increases the production of [[red blood cell]]s. Through a number of [[Anabolic steroid#Mechanism of action|mechanisms]] anabolic steroids stimulate the formation of muscles cells and hence cause an increase in the size of [[skeletal muscles]] leading to increased strength.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[androgenic]] effects of AAS are numerous. Processes affected include pubertal growth, [[sebaceous gland]] oil production, and sexuality (especially in fetal development). Some examples of virilizing effects are [[clitoral hypertrophy|growth of the clitoris]] in females and the [[penis]] in male children (the adult penis does not grow even when exposed to high doses of androgens), increased growth of androgen-sensitive hair ([[pubic hair|pubic]], beard, chest, and limb hair), increased [[vocal cord]] size, deepening the voice, increased [[libido]], suppression of [[endogenous|natural]] [[sex hormone]]s, and impaired [[spermatogenesis|production of sperm]].<ref>{{cite journal

The androgenic:anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to a anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g. treating [[hypogonadism]] in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia, osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery or prolonged immobilization. Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all anabolic steroids have significant androgenic effects.<ref name=Chr>George P. Chrousos, The gonadal hormones and inhibitors, in Bertram G. Katzung (Ed.), Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, McGraw-Hill Professional, 2006, ISBN 0-07-145153-6, p. 674<U+2013>676</ref>

A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic:anabolic ratio, dating back to the 1950s, uses the relative weights of ventral [[prostate]] (VP) and [[levator ani]] muscle (LA) of male [[Laboratory rat|rats]]. The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect, while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect. Two or more batches of rats are [[castrated]] and given no treatment and respectively some AAS of interest. The ''LA/VP ratio'' for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA/VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline: (LA<sub>c,t</sub><U+2013>LA<sub>c</sub>)/(VP<sub>c,t</sub><U+2013>VP<sub>c</sub>). The LA/VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone (typically 0.3<U+2013>0.4), but it's normalized for presentation purposes, and used as basis of comparison for other AAS, which have their androgenic:anabolic ratios scaled accordingly (as shown in the table above).<ref>L.G. Hershberger, E.G. Shipley, R.K. Meyer, Myotropic activity of 19-nortestosterone and other steroids determined by modified levator ani muscle method, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 83 (1953), 175-180</ref><ref name=pmid9593936/> In the early 2000s this procedure was standardized and generalized throughout [[OECD]] in what is now known as the [[Hershberger assay]].

==== Body composition and strength improvements ====
A review spanning more than three decades of experimental studies in men found that body weight may increase by 2<U+2013>5&nbsp;kg as a result of short term (<10 weeks) AAS use, which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass. Animal studies also found that fat mass was reduced, but most studies in humans failed to elucidate significant fat mass decrements. The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose dependent. Both [[muscle hypertrophy]] and the formation of new [[muscle fibers]] have been observed. The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use, although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out.<ref name=hk519-527>Hartgens and Kuipers (2004), p. 519-527</ref>

The upper region of the body (thorax, neck, shoulders and upper arm) seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of androgen receptors in the upper body. The largest difference in muscle fibre size between AAS users and non-users was observed in type I muscle fibres of the [[vastus lateralis]] and the [[trapezius muscle]] as a result of long-term AAS self-administration. After drug withdrawal the effects fade away slowly, but may persist for more than 6<U+2013>12 weeks after cessation of AAS use.<ref name=hk519-527/>

The same review observed strength improvements in the range of 5-20% of baseline strength, largely depending on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed was the [[bench press]].<ref name=hk528>Hartgens and Kuipers (2004), p. 528</ref> For almost two decades it was assumed that AAS only exerted significant effects in experienced strength athletes, particularly based on the studies of Hervey and coworkers.<ref name="pmid61389">{{cite journal |author=Hervey GR, Hutchinson I, Knibbs AV, ''et al.'' |title="Anabolic" effects of methandienone in men undergoing athletic training |journal=[[The Lancet|Lancet]] |volume=2 |issue=7988 |pages=699<U+2013>702 |year=1976 |month=October |pmid=61389 |doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(76)90001-5|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(76)90001-5}}</ref><ref name="pmid7018798">{{cite journal |author=Hervey GR, Knibbs AV, Burkinshaw L, ''et al.'' |title=Effects of methandienone on the performance and body composition of men undergoing athletic training |journal=Clin.

A number of severe side effects can occur if adolescents use anabolic steroids. For example, the steroids may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones (premature [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal fusion]] through increased levels of estrogen [[metabolite]]s), resulting in [[stunted growth]]. Other effects include, but are not limited to, accelerated [[bone age|bone maturation]], increased frequency and duration of erections, and premature sexual development.

===== Addiction potential =====
In an animal study male rats developed a [[conditioned place preference]] to testosterone injections into the [[nucleus accumbens]], an effect blocked by [[dopamine antagonist]]s, which suggests that androgen reinforcement is mediated by the brain. Moreover, testosterone appears to act through the mesolimbic dopamine system, a common substrate for drugs of abuse. Nonetheless, androgen reinforcement is not comparable to that of cocaine, nicotine or heroin. Instead, testosterone resembles other mild reinforcers, such as caffeine, or benzodiazepines. The potential for androgen addiction remains to be determined.<ref name="pmid15488545">{{cite journal |author=Wood RI |title=Reinforcing aspects of androgens |journal=Physiol.

Anabolic steroids have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. These sports include [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[shot put]] and other [[track and field]], [[cycling]], [[baseball]], [[wrestling]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[boxing]], [[football]], and [[cricket]]. Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of most sports. Anabolic steroid use occurs among adolescents, especially by those participating in competitive sports. It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high-school students in the U.S. may be as high as 2.7%.<ref>{{cite journal

== Legal and sport restrictions ==
The use of anabolic steroids is banned by all major sporting bodies, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[National Hockey League]], [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], [[International Cricket Council|ICC]], [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]], [[FIFA]], [[FINA]], [[UEFA]], the [[European Athletic Association]], and the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]].  Anabolic steroids are [[controlled substance]]s in many countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands (NL), the United Kingdom 
(UK) and the United States (U.S.), while in other countries, such as Mexico and Thailand, they are readily available [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

=== Legal status ===
The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country: some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many<!--most--> countries they are not illegal. In the U.S., anabolic steroids are currently listed as Schedule III [[controlled substances]] under the [[Controlled Substances Act]], which makes the first offense simple possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison, and the unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute anabolic steroids punishable as a first offense by up to five years in prison (to be increased to ten years, effective on or about April 13, 2009).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/844.htm|title=Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref> In Canada, anabolic steroids and their derivatives are part of the Controlled drugs and substances act and are [[Schedule IV (Canada)|Schedule IV]] substances, meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription; however, possession is not punishable, a consequence reserved for schedule I, II or III substances. Those guilty of buying or selling anabolic steroids in Canada can be imprisoned for up to 18 months. Import and export also carry similar penalties.<ref>{{citeweb |url= http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowFullDoc/cs/C-38.8//20070425/en?command=home&caller=SI&fragment=anabolic&search_type=all&day=25&month=4&year=2007&search_domain=cs&showall=L&statuteyear=all&lengthannual=50&length=50

==== United States ====
The history of the U.S. legislation on anabolic steroids goes back to the late 1980s, when the [[U.S. Congress]] considered placing anabolic steroids under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] victory at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]]. During deliberations, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as well as the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) all opposed listing anabolic steroids as controlled substances, citing the fact that use of these hormones does not lead to the physical or psychological dependence required for such scheduling under the Controlled Substance Act. Nevertheless, anabolic steroids were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990.<ref name="congress">{{USBill|101|HR|4658}}</ref> The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of anabolic steroids and human growth hormone. By the early 1990s, after anabolic steroids were scheduled in the U.S., several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the U.S., including Ciba, Searle, Syntex and others. In the Controlled Substances Act, anabolic steroids are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than [[estrogen]]s, [[progestin]]s, and [[corticosteroid]]s) that promote muscle growth. The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added [[prohormone]]s to the list of [[controlled substance]]s, with effect from January 20, 2005.<ref name="usdoj">{{cite web | url=http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/cngrtest/ct031604.html | title=News from DEA, Congressional Testimony, 03/16/04 | accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>

===== Movement for decriminalization =====
After the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990 listed anabolic steroids as [[Schedule III (US)|Schedule III]] controlled substances in the U.S., a small movement has arisen that is highly critical of current laws concerning anabolic steroids. On June 21, 2005, ''[[Real Sports]]'' aired a segment discussing the legality and prohibition of anabolic steroids in America.<ref name="RealSports">{{cite web

When pressed for scientific evidence by correspondent [[Armen Keteyian]] that anabolic steroids are as "highly fatal" as is often claimed, Wadler admitted there was no evidence. Bryant Gumbel concluded the "hoopla" concerning the dangers of anabolic steroids in the media was "all smoke and no fire".<ref name="RealSports"/> The show also featured John Romano, a pro-steroid activist who writes "The Romano Factor", a pro-steroid column for bodybuilding magazine ''[[Muscular Development]]''.



==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, anabolic steroids are classified as class C drugs for their illegal abuse potential, which puts them in the same class as [[benzodiazepines]]. Anabolic steroids are in Schedule 4, which is divided in 2 parts; Part 1 contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part 2 contains the anabolic and androgenic steroids. There are no special controls on Schedule 4 drugs.

In the late 2000s the worldwide trade in illicit AAS increased significantly, and authorities announced record captures on three continents. In 2006 Finnish authorities announced a record seizure of 11.8 million AAS tablets. A year later the DEA seized 11.4 million units of AAS in the largest U.S seizure ever. In first three months of 2008, Australian customs reported a record 300 seizures of AAS shipments.<ref name=kanayama08>{{cite journal |author=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: a looming public health concern? |journal=Drug Alcohol Depend |volume=98 |issue=1-2 |pages=1<U+2013>12 |year=2008 |month=November |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0376-8716(08)00191-9 |pmc=2646607}}</ref>

In the U.S., Canada and Europe, illicit steroids are sometimes purchased just like any other illegal drug, through dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources. Illegal anabolic steroids are sometimes sold at gyms, competitions, and through the mail, but may also be obtained through pharmacists, veterinarians, and physicians.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.gdcada.org/statistics/steroids.htm |title=Steroids |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=GDCADA }}</ref> In addition, a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as anabolic steroids, particularly via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies. Individuals also produce fake steroids and attempt to sell them over the Internet, causing a wide variety of health concerns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} In the U.S., black market importation continues from Mexico, Thailand, and other countries where steroids are more easily available as they are legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/reports/DEA/a0719/app2.htm |title=The Drug Enforcement Administration's International Operations (Redacted) |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Office of the Inspector General |publisher=USDOJ }}</ref>
