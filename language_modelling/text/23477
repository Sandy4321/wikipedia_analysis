'''Joanna''' ({{lang-el|<U+1F38><U+03C9><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B1> <U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+1F74> <U+03A7><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B6><U+1FB6>}}) is a woman mentioned in the gospels who was healed by [[Jesus]] and later supported him and his disciples in their travels. She was the wife of Chuza, who managed the household of [[Herod Antipas]], the king of [[Galilee]].<ref name=Zondervan>J. D. Douglas, Merrill C. Tenney, ''Zondervan Illustrated Bible Dictionary'' (2011), p. 742. ISBN 0310229839.</ref> Her name means "[[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]] has been gracious."<ref name=Zondervan/> In the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions, she is a saint. She is considered a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] who later became an apostle.<ref>{{bibleverse|Romans||16:7|NKJV}}</ref> In the [[Bible]], she is one of the women recorded in the [[Gospel of Luke]] as accompanying Jesus and the twelve: "[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]]... and Joanna the wife of [[Herod Antipas|Herod's]] steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources".<ref>{{bibleverse|Luke||8:2-3}}</ref>
She was also one of the women who discovered the empty tomb of Jesus on the first Easter morning. 

==Joanna is one of Luke's witnesses==
There are 13 separate references to Herod in the Gospel of Luke, only four of which can also be found in the other gospels. This means that there are nine references to Herod in the Gospel of Luke for which Luke had to have a source independent of another gospel. Hastings (1958) suggests that Joanna could easily have informed Jesus and Luke of the splendid style in which Antipas and his court officials lived. Joanna may have been one of the eyewitnesses available to Luke as a source for his Herodian material.<ref>Hastings, Adrian, Prophet and witness in Jerusalem: a study of the teaching of St. Luke, (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1958), 38.</ref>

Joanna is among a group of women who are the first resurrection witnesses, along with Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and other women (Luke 24:10). These women went to the apostles who thought their testimony about the risen Lord was nonsense, though Peter and some others decided to look at the tomb for themselves.<ref>Luke 24:12, 24</ref> Joanna is therefore to be included in the "ones with them" that Jesus calls "witnesses" (martyrs) (Luke 24:48). She is also one of the apostles mentioned in Acts 1:2-3 that Jesus chose. These apostles complied with Jesus' charge to remain in [[Jerusalem]] until they received the Holy Spirit. Acts 1:8 repeats Luke 24:48 by calling this group "my witnesses (martyrs)". 

Acts 24:10 and 8:3 of Luke's section of the bible gives the list of these apostles as the eleven,<ref>cf. Acts 2:32; 3;15</ref> the women, and Mary, mother of Jesus, with his brothers.<ref>Acts 5:32</ref> When the time came to choose a replacement for Judas the same criterion of witness from the beginning is used (Acts 1:21-22).

===Identification with Junia ===
Both Richard J. Bauckham and Ben Witherington III conclude that the disciple Joanna is the same woman as the Christian [[Junia]] mentioned by Paul in his ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' (Romans 16:7). Paul says that Junia was famous among the apostles and that she was in the Lord before him which must be prior to 34 CE. She is likely therefore, given the evidence presented above, to have been a witness of everything from the time of the baptism of John.<ref>Acts 1:22</ref>

===Joanna granddaughter of Theophilus===
An ossuary has been discovered bearing the inscription, "Johanna, granddaughter of Theophilus, the High Priest."<ref>D. Barag and D. Flusser, ''The Ossuary of Yehohanah Granddaughter of the High Priest Theophilus'', ''Israel Exploration Journal'', 36 (1986), 39-44.</ref> She may have been the Joanna mentioned in the Bible.

==Christian traditions==

===Greek Orthodox===
'''Saint Joanna the Myrrhbearer''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] <U+0391><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+0399><U+03C9><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B1> <U+03B7> <U+039C><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>) is commemorated among the eight women who carried myrrh in the [[New Testament]] in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on the "Sunday of the [[Myrrhbearers]]", which is two Sundays after [[Easter|Pascha]] (Orthodox Easter). From this commemoration, in the revised [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] she is commemorated as one of Myrrhbearers on August 3 together with [[Mary Mother of James|Mary, the Mother of James the less and Jude]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]].<ref>Philip H. Pfatteicher New Book of Festivals and Commemorations. Page 376. 2008.</ref>

== Joanna in fiction ==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2012}}
Joanna was a secondary character in [[Margaret George]]<U+2019>s 2002 [[novel]] ''Mary, Called Magdalene''. In the novel, Joanna, cast from [[Herod Antipas|Herod]]<U+2019>s household by Chuza for being [[Spiritual possession|possessed]], is healed by Jesus in [[Capernaum]]. She then joins the other disciples. She is the second woman, after Mary, and becomes her friend.

Joanna is the main character in Mary Rourke's 2006 novel ''Two Women of Galilee''. In Rourke's telling, Joanna is the daughter of a family that had become [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and ceased to practice [[Judaism]] as they obtained a privileged position in the court of Herod. Mary is Joanna's long-lost cousin from a branch of the family that was still observant. When they meet they become close friends. Joanna meets Jesus through her friendship with Mary and he heals her of tuberculosis. The story centers on the friendship of Joanna and Mary, retelling events from the Gospel from the women's point of view.
