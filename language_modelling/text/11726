'''HMS ''Warrior''''' was a [[Duke of Edinburgh class cruiser|''Duke of Edinburgh''-class]] [[armoured cruiser]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1900s. She was stationed in the [[Mediterranean]] when the [[World War I|First World War]] began. The ship participated in the [[pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|pursuit]] of the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}} and [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Breslau}} in August 1914. ''Warrior'' was transferred to the [[Grand Fleet]] in December 1914 and remained there for the rest of her career. She sank after taking heavy damage during the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916.

==Description==
[[File:Warrior class cruiser diagrams Brasseys 1912.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Right elevation and plan view from Brassey's Naval Annual; the shaded areas show her armouring]]
''Warrior'' displaced {{convert|13550|LT|MT|lk=on}} as built and {{convert|14500|LT|MT}} fully loaded, with a length of {{convert|505|ft|4|in|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|73|ft|6|in|m|1}} and a draft of {{convert|27|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by four-cylinder [[Compound engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple-expansion steam engine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|23650|ihp|lk=on}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|23.3|kn|lk=on}}.<ref name=r4>Roberts, p. 34</ref>

Her main armament consisted of six [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX - X|BL {{convert|9.2|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mark X guns]] in single Mk V turrets distributed in two centerline turrets (one each fore and one aft) and four turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels. Her secondary armament of four [[BL 7.5 inch Mk II - V naval gun|BL {{convert|7.5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} Mark II or Mark V guns]] in single Mk II turrets was carried amidships, between the wing 9.2-inch guns. Twenty-six Vickers QF [[Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers|3-pounders]] were fitted, ten on turret roofs and eight each on the forward and aft superstructures. The last four ships of the {{sclass|Duke of Edinburgh|cruiser|0}} cruisers had a secondary armament of turreted 7.5-inch guns rather than the {{convert|6|in|0|adj=on}} guns in open barbettes of the first two ships; these latter four were sometimes referred to as the ''Warrior'' class.<ref>Roberts, pp. 34, 36</ref> Because of the extra topweight of the turrets in comparison to their half-sisters their stability was reduced which made them very good seaboats and steady gun platforms.<ref name=r4/>

==Service==
''Warrior'' was ordered as part of the 1903<U+2013>04 naval construction programme as the first of four armoured cruisers. She was [[Keel|laid down]] on 5 November 1903 at [[Pembroke Dockyard]], launched on 25 November 1905 and completed on 12 December 1906.<ref>Chesneau and Kolesnik, p. 72</ref> On completion, ''Warrior'' was assigned to the [[5th Cruiser Squadron]] in the [[Channel Fleet]] until 1909, when she was transferred to the [[2nd Cruiser Squadron]]. In 1913 the ship was transferred to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[British Mediterranean Fleet|Mediterranean Fleet]]. She was involved in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser ''Goeben'' and light cruiser ''Breslau'' at the outbreak of World War I, but was ordered not to engage them.<ref name="Conways II p13">Gardiner and Gray, p. 13</ref> ''Warrior'' participated in the Allied [[Battle of Antivari|sweep]] which led to the sinking of the Austro-Hungarian [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Zenta}} in August 1914.<ref>Chatterton, p. 19</ref> A few days later she was ordered to [[Suez]] to defend the [[Suez Canal]] against any Turkish attack and remained there until 6 November when she was ordered to [[Gibraltar]] to join a squadron of French and British ship to search for German warships still at sea off the African coast. This was cancelled on 19 November after the location of the German [[East Asia Squadron]] was revealed by survivors of the [[Battle of Coronel]].<ref>Corbett, I, p. 371, 406<U+2013>07</ref>

''Warrior'' joined the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and was assigned to the 1st [[Cruiser Squadron]] under [[Rear-Admiral]] Sir [[Robert Keith Arbuthnot]].<ref>Corbett, II, p. 418</ref> At the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May 1916, the 1st Cruiser Squadron was in front of the Grand Fleet, on the right side. At 5:47 p.m.<ref group=Note>The times used in this article are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> the squadron flagship, {{HMS|Defence|1907|6}}, and ''Warrior'' spotted the German [[II Scouting Group]] and opened fire. Their shells felt short and the two ships turned to port in pursuit, cutting in front of the battlecruiser {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}, which was forced to turn away to avoid a collision. Shortly afterwards they spotted the disabled German light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden}} and closed to engage. When the two ships reached a range of {{convert|5500|yd}} from ''Wiesbaden'' they were spotted in turn at 6:05 by the German battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger}} and four battleships who were less than {{convert|8000|yd}} away. The fire from the German ships was heavy and ''Defence'' blew up at 6:20.<ref name=m7>Marder, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref> ''Warrior'' was hit by at least fifteen {{convert|28|cm|adj=on}} and six {{convert|15|cm|adj=on|1}} shells,<ref name="campbell p181-2">Campbell, pp. 181<U+2013>82</ref>, but was saved when the German ships switched their fire to the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} when its steering jammed and caused the ship to make two complete circles within sight of much of the [[High Seas Fleet]].<ref name=m7/>

The German shells caused large fires to break out and heavy flooding although her engines continued running for long enough to allow her to withdraw to the west.<ref name="Campbell p152-3">Campbell 1998, pp. 152<U+2013>53</ref> She was taken in tow by the [[seaplane tender]] [[HMS Engadine (1911)|HMS ''Engadine'']] who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 08:25 a.m. on 1 June<ref name="Campbell p319">Campbell, p. 319</ref> when her upper deck was only 4&nbsp;feet (1.2&nbsp;m) above the water,<ref>Fawcett and Hooper, p. 93</ref> and subsequently [[Shipwreck|foundered]].<ref name="Conways II p13"/>
