'''William "Bill" Howard White''' (born [[June 16]], [[1954]]) is the current [[mayor]] of the [[city]] of [[Houston, Texas]] ([[January 2]], [[2004]]&ndash;present).

==Education and career==
Born in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] as the son of school teachers, White attended [[Harvard University]] on [[American Legion]] scholarships and graduated [[magna cum laude]] with a degree in economics. He then attended [[University of Texas School of Law|The University of Texas School of Law]], where he was elected editor-in-chief of its law review and graduated with highest honors.

White began his career as a [[lawyer]] at [[Susman Godfrey, LLP]], a leading Houston law firm, from 1979 to 1993, where he practiced business litigation and anti-trust law, and eventually became partner. He served as [[U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy]] under [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] from 1993 to 1995. He organized [[Frontera Resources]], a developer of oil and gas in the Caspian Sea region, and was also the chairman of the [[Texas Democratic Party]], from 1995 to 1998. He was the president and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[WEDGE Group]], an energy, construction and real estate company, from 1997 to 2004.

==Community and business activities==
White has served on the board of directors for the [[North American Electrical Reliability Council]]. He was chairman for both the World Trade Division and the Environmental Advisory Committee, and served on the executive committee, for the [[Greater Houston Partnership]]. He has also served on the board of directors for the [[Houston Quality of Life Coalition]]. 

==Mayoral elections==
In 2003, White, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], ran in Houston's officially nonpartisan mayoral election to succeed Mayor [[Lee Brown]], who was [[term limit|term-limited]]. Running as a moderate with business experience, he appealed to Democrats as well as many Republicans despite having almost no name recognition. He and Republican former Houston City Councilman [[Orlando Sanchez]] defeated Democratic Texas State Representative [[Sylvester Turner]]. In the runoff, White defeated Sanchez with 63 percent of the vote.

In 2005, White was challenged for re-election by minor and perennial candidates and won re-election with 91 percent of the vote (a record landslide since Mayor [[Bob Lanier (politician)|Bob Lanier's]] re-election in 1995), nullifying the need for a runoff.

Americans witnessed Mayor White's hands-on management style when he helped lead Houston's competent, compassionate dealing with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

==Personal==
White is currently married to his second wife, Andrea White, a writer and civic leader. They have three children, and are members of [[Methodism|St. Luke's United Methodist Church]].
