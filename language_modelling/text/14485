The '''1967 Stock''' was a fleet of deep-level tube stock which operated on the [[Victoria line]] between 1 September 1968 and 30 June 2011, and was the original rolling stock provided from the line's opening. A part of the fleet also ran on the Woodford-Hainault section of the [[Central line]], which was fitted with the same ATO system as the Victoria line, from 21 February 1968 to an unknown date in 1984.<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=10}}</ref>

Each train consisted of two four-car units coupled together; trains are equipped for [[automatic train operation]] (ATO). The train operator has control over the doors, and starts the train by simultaneously pressing two buttons in the cab to start the automatic process. The trains were built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs, the first [[London Underground]] trains to be designed in this way. The total order of 316 cars (39.5 trains) was built by [[Metro-Cammell]] and later refurbished at [[Rosyth]].<ref>{{harvnb |Hardy |2002 |p=11}}</ref> Withdrawn cars of 1972 Mk I stock were augmented into the 1967 stock fleet in the 1990s, thus creating a fleet of 43 1967 stock trains. The 1972 Mk I cars were used as the middle parts of trains, as they were not fitted with ATO equipment. The top speed of the former 1967 stock was 70 mph (110kmh).

The trains were maintained at [[Northumberland Park Depot]], the only part of the Victoria line which is not below ground.

==Design==
London Transport had built a batch of 12 prototype motor cars, known as the [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 stock]], to test out a number of new features,<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=86}}</ref> and it was originally intended that these would form the basis for a production run to replace the ageing [[London Underground Standard Stock|Standard Stock]]. However, tube usage was increasing, and with the Standard Stock proving unreliable in these new circumstances, the decision was taken to build the [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 stock]], which was essentially the same as the earlier [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 stock]]. Metropolitan-Cammell, the manufacturers, built both classes on the same production line, without a break.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=91}}</ref>

The 1967 Stock was the first opportunity to build cars which included many of the enhancements tried out in the 1960 Stock. They were designed for the Victoria Line, and each train consisted of eight cars, marshalled as two four-car units. Each unit had a driving motor car at both ends, and two trailer cars between them. The outer ends of the motor cars were fitted with Wedglock automatic couplers, and all cars in a unit were semi-permanently coupled together. It was not expected that units would be uncoupled in service, and the arrangement on previous stock where uncoupling required simultaneous operations to be performed in both cabs was replaced by one where uncoupling could be initiated in the first car and completed afterwards in the second.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=96}}</ref>

Although the Victoria Line was to be equipped for automatic operation, a single controller to allow the trains to be driven manually in the depot or in emergency while in service was provided. This incorporated both traction control and braking. Door controls were provided in the cabs, and a facility to isolate either of the two units from the leading cab was also included. For the first time on tube stock, all control circuits were switched by cam-operated [[Miniature snap-action switch|micro-switches]]. They were used on the traction and brake controller, the disconnecting units, the fault isolating switches, the door controls and other control equipment, and resulted in a significant reduction in the routine electical inspection needing to be carried out.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=97}}</ref>

[[Dynamic braking|Rheostatic braking]] was used on the trains, and required amendments to the standard P.C.M. (Pneumatic Camshaft Motor) controllers, to include the switching in of the rheostats. When the train was to be stopped, rheostatic braking was used first, after which [[Railway air brake|friction brakes]] on the trailer cars were brought into action. If required, friction brakes on the motor cars could also be used. The rheostatic braking fades as the speed drops below {{convert|10|mph|kph}}, and so slow speed braking was always by friction brake. As on the 1960 Stock, traction was supplied by four motors, one on each axle. The motors on each [[bogie]] were wired in series permanently, and the traction controller performed series/parallel switching of the pairs of motors. The handbrake used hydraulic power to apply it, and then remained locked on until hydraulic pressure was used to release it.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=97-98}}</ref>

Window design followed the 1960 Stock, consisting of two large windows between each set of doors, giving a double-glazed appearance. The doors opened into the gap between the inner and outer skins. However, on the doors themselves, the windows were curved, so that the top was much higher than previous designs, allowing passengers to see station signs without stooping. Visibility for the driver was improved by the provision of wrap-around cab windows. Loading times at stations were improved by providing a stand-back beside the doors, so that passengers standing near the doors do not block so much of the exit. Lighting was by [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tube]], with two lights in each car fed from the battery through an invertor, so that they remain lit if the motor alternator shuts down.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=98-99}}</ref> Two types of motor alternator were used. Some were manufactured by [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]], and generated 230V AC at 850 Hz, which was stepped down to 115V for the lighting and 58V for the battery charger. The alternative was manufactured by [[English Electric]], and generated 60V at 850 Hz, which was stepped up for the lighting.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=103}}</ref>

===Delivery===
When first opened, the Victoria Line terminated at [[London Victoria station|Victoria station]], and an order for 61 four-car units was placed with Metropolitan-Cammell. They were fitted with [[Automatic train operation]] (ATO) equipment, which had been developed on the Woodford to Hainault section of the Central Line, using modified 1960 Stock trains. At first, trains were delivered to Ruislip Depot on the Piccadilly Line. Following initial preparation for service, they were then transferred to Hainault Depot, where they ran as single units, so that the ATO equipment could be thoroughly tested. Once passed, they were taken to Leytonstone, from where [[London Underground battery-electric locomotives|battery locomotives]] were used to haul them over [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]] tracks to Northumberland Park Depot. After September 1968, when the first part of the Victoria Line opened, trains were transferred from Ruislip to Northumberland Park directly, via a connecting link between the Piccadilly Line and the Victoria Line at Finsbury Park. Several four-car units were briefly transferred to operate the Woodford-Hainault service over the years, when the 1960 Stock units needed modification or overhaul.<ref name=bruce106>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=106}}</ref>

The extension of the Victoria Line to [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] required additional trains, and a further 18 four-car units were built. These were identical to the original units, and the numbering scheme followed on from where the first batch ended. Increasing traffic levels on the Victoria Line eventually required more trains, which posed a problem, since no other stock could operate on the line, because of the need for it to operate automatically.<ref name=bruce106/> The [[London Underground 1972 Stock|1972 Mk I Stock]] was similar, although it was built to run as seven-car trains, with a four-car unit much like the 1967 stock, and a three-car unit consisting of a driving motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car, which was a motor car with no cab for the driver. Instead it was fitted with a shunting control cabinet at the inner end. The main differences between the 1972 and the 1967 stock was that the latter was designed for two-man operation, having door controls for the guard at the trailing end of the driving motor cars, and that it was reversible, as it had been ordered for the Northern Line, where the Kennington Loop can result in either end of the train facing the north end of the line.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=109}}</ref> 

However, most of the equipment was compatible with the 1967 stock, and so some of the 1972 stock was modified to work on the Victoria Line. Two seven-car trains would be split up, and the uncoupling non-driving motors would be discarded, providing three four-car units. From an eight-car train, the outer motor cars would be removed, and used to replace the inner motor cars of an eight-car train of 1967 stock, releasing two motor cars fitted with ATO equipment, which would then be fitted to the outer ends of the 1972 stock.<ref name=bruce106/>

===Automatic operation===
The system of automatic train operation developed for the Victoria Line, and hence the 1967 Stock, used two types of coded signals, which were fed into the running rails, and pickup up by two independent sets of coils on the train. The first was the safety signalling system, which used a continuous signal encoded at 125 Hz. This was used to pass codes at 420, 270 or 180 pulses per minute (ppm) to the control circuits. Failure to receive any of these codes resulted in the emergency brake operating. 180 ppm allowed the train to operate at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} but did not allow power to be applied if it had previously been shut off. 270 ppm allowed the train to operate up to the same speed, but power could also be re-applied if it had previously been shut off. Finally, 420 ppm allowed the train to run at the speeds set by the driving command system, which was the second of the two coded message systems.<ref name=bruce107>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=107}}</ref>

The driving command system used short sections of the running rails, {{convert|10|ft|m}} long, which were called 'spots', and carried signals coded at between 1 kHz and 20 kHz. Running speeds were coded so that 100 Hz represented {{convert|1|mph|kph}}, so a 3.5 kHz spot indicated that the train should be travelling at {{convert|35|mph|kph}} and a 2 kHz spot that it should be travelling at {{convert|20|mph|kph}}. In addition, a 15 kHz spot indicated that the traction motors should be shut down, but the train allowed to coast, while a 20 kHz spot indicated that the train should stop, as the next signal was at danger. When a train passed a speed control spot on the approach to a station, the brakes were applied at different rates, depending on whether the train was travelling faster or slower than the specified speed. Once the speed was below {{convert|4|mph|kph}}, the brakes were released slightly, to ensure a smooth stop, and the resting position would be within {{convert|5|ft|m}} of the desired stop point.<ref name=bruce107/>

Braking spots were provided at {{convert|5|mph|kph|adj=on}} increments, from the expected maximum speed downwards, but if the train had been stopped at a signal by a 20 kHz spot, for instance, the actual speed on approaching the station would be much slower, and the outer spots would be ignored. Speed control was by an electronic governor and a frequency generator mounted on one of the traction motors, with an overriding mechanical governor, connected to one of the axles on the trailer cars.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |p=110}}</ref> All trains were fitted with a fail-safe trip valve connected to the emergency brakes, and the mechanical governor operated this device if the speed exceeded {{convert|25|mph|kph}} when the 420 code was not being received, if the speed exceeded {{convert|50|mph|kph}} under any circumstances, or if the speed exceeded {{convert|11.5|mph|kph}} when the train was being operated in 'slow manual' mode. The trains could be driven manually at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph|kph}} if safety codes were still being received, or at {{convert|10|mph|kph}} if no codes were being received, either because of a failure or because the train was in the depot, where the tracks were not coded.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1968 |pp=110, 112}}</ref>

==Preservation==
[[File:1967 Tube Stock at Holborn.jpg|thumb|right|The 1967 tube stock at Holborn, during a [[rail tour]].]]
A refurbished motor car in which [[Queen Elizabeth II]] travelled during the official opening of the line in 1969, number 3052, is preserved in a non-working condition in the [[London Transport Museum]]'s Acton collection. It was withdrawn from service in October 2010.<ref name="3052_acton">{{cite web|url=http://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2010/11/08/londons-transport-museum-gains-a-royal-train/|title=London<U+2019>s Transport Museum gains a "Royal Train"|date=8 November 2010|publisher=IanVisits|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> An unrefurbished driving motor, number 3016, was preserved at the [[Walthamstow Pump House Museum]] until the end of the site's lease in 2011, and was scrapped on site.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Announcer system==
In 2000<U+2013>2001 the trains were retrofitted with an automated voice announcer system, featuring the voice of [[Emma Clarke]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Phillips |first= Rhodri |title= What Emma, outspoken 'Voice of the Underground', really thinks of Tube travellers |work =[[Daily Mail]] |location =London |date= 24 November 2007 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-496165/What-Emma-outspoken-Voice-Underground--really-thinks-Tube-travellers.html}}</ref> Some of the announcements had to be changed due to the arrival of the Eurostar at St Pancras and the London Overground.

==Replacement==
The 1967 Stock has been replaced by [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]], built by [[Bombardier Transportation]] as part of the Victoria Line modernisation programme. The first prototype of the 2009 Stock was completed in 2007, and production trains were delivered from 2009 onwards. The first one entered service on 21 July 2009.

In January 2010, the first eight cars of 1967 Stock were moved to [[C F Booth]] of [[Rotherham]] to be scrapped.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.rotherhamadvertiser.co.uk/news/85279/booth-wins-underground-trains-scrap-contract.aspx |title=Booth wins Underground trains scrap contract |work= Rotherham Advertiser |date=8 February 2010}}</ref> They had been used as a test train for several years. 

After 28 May 2011 at 00:33, 1967 Stock trains were no longer able to run to stations north of Seven Sisters, because of the commissioning of a new, incompatible signalling system (and decommissioning of the old one) between Seven Sisters and Walthamstow Central. The last 1967 stock train from Walthamstow Central was formed of units 3075 and 3078, running as set number 246.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The last-ever 1967 Stock train in passenger service on the remainder of the Victoria Line (Brixton to Seven Sisters) ran on 30 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://londonist.com/2011/06/last-day-of-service-for-old-victoria-line-trains.php |title=Last Day Of Service For Old Victoria Line Trains |last=Nicholas |first=Dean |date=30 June 2011 |publisher=Londonist (blog) |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>
The last service departed Seven Sisters at 1829, formed of cars 3159+4159+4059+3059 and 3179+4179+4079+3079, running as set number 247. After having reached Brixton, the train returned to Seven Sisters for the last time, arriving at approx 1950. Due to delays caused by other factors, it ran around 20 minutes late on its last run.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
