The '''National Hockey League''' ('''NHL''') ({{lang-fr|Ligue nationale de hockey - LNH}}) is a professional [[ice hockey]] league composed of 30 teams located throughout North America. It is the premier professional ice hockey league in the world,<ref name ="premier">{{cite web |title=National Hockey League |first=James |last=Marsh |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0005623 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-06-11}}</ref> and one of the North American [[Major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada|major professional sports leagues]].

The league was formed in 1917 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] from a predecessor organization, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), founded in 1909. It started with four teams and, through a series of expansions, contractions, and relocations, the league is now composed of 30 teams, 24 of which are based in the United States and six in Canada. After a [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|labour<!--This article uses Canadian English spelling--> dispute]] that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004<U+2013>05 season, the league has staged a successful comeback, including revenue and profit growth.

{{Main|History of the National Hockey League}}
After a series of disputes in the Canadian [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) between [[Eddie Livingstone]], owner of the [[Toronto Blueshirts]], and other owners, the owners of the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Montreal Wanderers]], [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Senators]], and [[Quebec Bulldogs]] met at the [[Windsor Hotel]] in Montreal to talk about the NHA's future.<ref name="mcfarlane_15_16"><nowiki>[McFarlane]</nowiki>, pp.15<U+2013>16</ref> Their discussions eventually led to the creation of the National Hockey League on November 22, 1917. Three former NHA franchises, the Canadiens, Wanderers and Senators were founding members of the NHL, along with Toronto under new management. Because of the dispute, the Toronto franchise was given temporarily to the Toronto Arena Co. to operate, and is often referred to as the Arenas, although they operated without a nickname until 1918.<ref name="mcfarlane_15_16" /><ref>Toronto Arena Hockey Club was founded in October 1918. <nowiki>see [Holzman]</nowiki></ref>

[[Image:Montreal Canadiens hockey team, October 1942.jpg|thumb|240px|left||Montreal Canadiens in 1942]]

Even though the league struggled to stay in business during its first decade, the NHL's teams were very successful on the ice; only once, in 1925, did a team from any other league win the [[Stanley Cup]], and by 1926 the NHL was the only league competing for the Cup.<ref name="mcfarlane_5"><nowiki>[McFarlane]</nowiki>, pp.5</ref> The NHL then started a process of expansion: the [[Boston Bruins]] (the first U.S.-based NHL franchise) and [[Montreal Maroons]] entered the league in 1924<U+2013>25; the [[New York Americans]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] entered in the 1925<U+2013>26 season; and the [[New York Rangers]], [[Chicago Blackhawks|Chicago Black Hawks]] (now spelled Blackhawks), and [[Detroit Red Wings|Detroit Cougars]] (now known as the Red Wings) entered in the 1926<U+2013>27 season, raising the number of teams in the NHL to ten. The [[Great Depression]] and the onset of World War II, took a toll on the league, and by 1942 the NHL was reduced to six teams. These six teams (the Montreal Canadiens, [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers) are collectively known as the [[Original Six]], and for the next quarter-century were the only teams in the National Hockey League. During this time the Norris family had influence over four of the teams as Detroit and Chicago were operated by members of the family, and Boston and New York had mortgages to the family. The media would nickname the league the "Norris House League."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070137/index.htm |date=1959-02-02 |title=Black Hawks On The Wing |first=Robert H. |last=Boyle |accessdate=2008-04-25}}</ref>

On January 18, 1958, a milestone in the NHL's history occurred, as the first [[black Canadian]] person ever to play in the NHL stepped onto the ice for the Boston Bruins, Fredericton, New Brunswick-born left wing [[Willie O'Ree]]. He would play in 45 games for the Bruins, in the 1957-58 and 1960-61 seasons, scoring six goals and ten assists in his NHL career.

By the mid 1960s, the desire for a network television contract in the U.S., and concerns that the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]] was planning to declare itself a major league and challenge for the Stanley Cup, spurred the NHL to undertake its first [[1967 NHL Expansion|expansion]] since the 1920s. Six new teams were added to the NHL roster in [[1967<U+2013>68 NHL season|1967]], and were placed in their own newly-created division. Two teams each were added in California, Pennsylvania, and the Mississippi River valley. The teams were the [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[California Golden Seals|Oakland Seals]] (later [[Cleveland Barons (NHL)|Cleveland Barons]], then merged with Minnesota), [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[Philadelphia Flyers]], [[Minnesota North Stars]] ([[Dallas Stars]] since 1993), and [[St. Louis Blues (hockey)|St. Louis Blues]]. Three years later, the NHL added the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]].

In [[1972<U+2013>73 WHA season|1972]], the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) was formed, the first potential rival to the NHL in decades. Although it was at first publicly dismissed as a threat by the NHL owners, the NHL decided to rush its own expansion plans in 1972 by adding the [[New York Islanders]] and [[Atlanta Flames]] (which became the [[Calgary Flames]] in 1980) to forestall WHA franchises in newly constructed arenas in those markets, followed by the addition of the [[Kansas City Scouts]] (which became the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] in 1976 before becoming the [[New Jersey Devils]] in 1982) and [[Washington Capitals]] two years later.<ref name="mcfarlane_116_117_119"><nowiki>[McFarlane]</nowiki>, pp.116<U+2013>117,119</ref> The two leagues fought for the rights of players and fans until the WHA folded in [[1978<U+2013>79 WHA season|1979]] as part of an agreement whereby four of the remaining six WHA teams would enter the NHL as expansion teams: the [[Hartford Whalers]] (the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] since 1997), [[Qu<U+00E9>bec Nordiques]] (the [[Colorado Avalanche]] since 1995), [[Edmonton Oilers]], and [[Winnipeg Jets]] (the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] since 1996).<ref name="mcfarlane_166_167"><nowiki>[McFarlane]</nowiki>, pp.166<U+2013>167</ref>

With the expansion in 1974, the NHL was aligned into 2 conferences. These conferences, the Clarence Campbell (representing the west) and the Prince of Wales (representing the east) each had 2 divisions. The Campbell's divisions were the Lester Patrick and Conn Smythe; while the Wales' divisions were the Jack Adams and James Norris (The Norris and Patrick divisions switched conferences for the 1981-82 season). This changed in 1993 when the NHL was realigned into geographical conferences (East & West), divided into two divisions<U+2014>three divisions since 1998-99. The Eastern Conference currently consists of the Atlantic, Southeast, and Northeast while the Western is made up of the Central, Northwest, and Pacific. Reasons for realignment include further expansion into the U.S. and efforts to expand the NHL's breadth of audience.

After a period of stability in the 1980s, the NHL further expanded with nine new franchises in ten years. The [[San Jose Sharks]] entered in 1991; a season later the [[Ottawa Senators]] would return to the NHL along with the addition of the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. In 1993, the league added two additional teams, the [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] and the [[Florida Panthers]]. Next came the [[Nashville Predators]] in 1998, the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] in 1999, and then the [[Minnesota Wild]] and the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] in 2000, bringing the total to 30 teams.

{{NHLHistory}}
There have been three league-wide work stoppages in NHL history, all happening between 1992 and 2005.

The first was a [[1992 NHL players' strike|strike]] by the [[National Hockey League Players Association]] in April [[1991<U+2013>92 NHL season|1992]] which lasted for 10 days, but the strike was settled quickly and all affected games were rescheduled.<ref name="labour_history">{{cite web |title=We've been here before |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/flashback.html |author=CBC Sports |publisher=cbc.ca |date=2004<U+2013>01<U+2013>29 |accessdate =2006-06-09}}</ref> A [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL lockout|lockout]] at the start of the [[1994<U+2013>95 NHL season|1994<U+2013>95 season]] forced the league to reduce the schedule from 84 games to just 48, with the teams playing only intra-conference games during the reduced season.<ref name="labour_history" /> The resulting [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] was set for renegotiation in 1998 and extended to September 15, 2004.<ref name="2004_lockout">{{cite journal |title=The hockey lockout of 2004<U+2013>05 |last=audohar |first=Paul D. |journal=Monthly Labor Review |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/12/art3full.pdf |month=December | year=2005|format=PDF}}</ref>

With no new agreement in hand when the existing contract expired on September 15, 2004, league commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced a [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|lockout]] of the players union and cessation of operations by the NHL head office.<ref name="2004_lockout" /> The lockout shut down the league for 310 days, the longest in sports history; the NHL was the first professional sports league to lose an entire season.<ref name="2004_lockout" /> The league vowed to install what it dubbed "cost certainty" for its teams, but the [[NHL Players Association]] countered that the move was little more than a [[euphemism]] for a [[salary cap]], which the union initially said it would not accept. A new collective bargaining agreement was ratified in July 2005 with a term of six years with an option of extending the [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] for an additional year at the end of the term, allowing the NHL to resume as of the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]].<ref name="2004_lockout" />

On October 6, 2005, the first post-lockout NHL season took to the ice with 15 games, and consequently all 30 teams. Of those 15 games, 11 were in front of sell-out crowds.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHL returns with packed arenas, single-date attendance record |url=http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/10/237032.html |publisher=NHL.com |author=NHL.com |date=2005<U+2013>10<U+2013>06 |accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> The NHL received record attendance in the 2005<U+2013>06 season. 20,854,169 fans, an average of 16,955 per game, was a 1.2% increase over the previous mark held in the 2001<U+2013>02 season.<ref name="season_review">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/hockey_features/season_review.html |title=A season to remember |publisher=CBC.ca |first=John |last=Molinaro |date=2006<U+2013>04<U+2013>20 |accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> Also, the [[Montreal Canadiens]], [[Calgary Flames]], [[Colorado Avalanche]], [[Minnesota Wild]], and the [[Vancouver Canucks]] sold out all of their home games;<ref name="season_review" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Canucks abuse fan trust |first=Bob |last=Mackin |date=2006<U+2013>04<U+2013>18 |accessdate=2006-07-03 |publisher=Slam Sports |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Vancouver/2006/04/18/1538866-sun.html}}</ref> all six Canadian teams played to 98% capacity or better at every home game.<ref name="season_review" /> 24 of the 30 clubs finished even or ahead of their 2003<U+2013>04 mark.

{{Main|Ice hockey}}
Each National Hockey League regulation game is an ice hockey game played between two teams and is 60 minutes long. The game is composed of three 20-minute periods with an intermission of either 15<U+00BD> or 17 minutes (if nationally televised) between periods.<ref name="intermission">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule90.html |title=Time of match |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-12-02 |year=2006}}</ref> Television timeouts are taken at the first stoppage of play after 6, 10, and 14 minutes of elapsed time unless there is a [[Powerplay|power play]] or the first stoppage is the result of a goal. In these cases, the timeout will occur at the first stoppage after the penalty expires or the next stoppage after the goal, respectively. A new rule was introduced for the 2007-08 season that if the first stoppage of play is an [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]], the TV timeout does not occur. This is to prevent players from getting a break despite not being allowed to change. At the end of the 60-minute regulation time, the team with the most goals wins the game. If a game is tied after regulation time, [[Overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] ensues. During the regular season, overtime is a five-minute, four-player on four-player [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] period, in which the first team to score a goal wins the game. Until the [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], if no team was able to score in the five-minute overtime, the game ended in a tie.

Beginning in the 2005<U+2013>06 season, if the game is still tied at the end of overtime, the game enters a [[Overtime (ice hockey)#North American shootout|shootout]]. Three players for each team in turn take a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]]. The team with the most goals during the three-round shootout wins the game. If the game is still tied after the three shootout rounds, the shootout continues but becomes sudden death. Whichever team ultimately wins the shootout is awarded a goal in the game score and thus awarded two points in the standings. The losing team in overtime or shootout is awarded only one.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/rules/a/shootout_debate_2.htm |title=How the NHL Shootout Works |accessdate=2008-08-04 |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Jamie |work=About.com |publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> Shootout goals and saves are not tracked in hockey statistics; shootout statistics are tracked separately.

Shootouts do not occur during the playoffs. In the playoffs, sudden-death 20-minute five-on-five periods are played until one team scores. While a game could theoretically continue forever, only four games have reached five overtime periods, two have reached six, and none have gone beyond six.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oh, what a night ... and morning.

{{Main|Hockey rink}}
National Hockey League games are played on an oblong [[hockey rink]], similar to a rectangle with rounded corners, and surrounded by a wall. It measures 25.91 by 60.92 metres (85 by 200 ft) in the NHL,<ref name="rink">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule02.html |title=Dimensions of Rink |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-06-08 |year=2005}}</ref> while international standards call for a rink measuring 29<U+2013>30 metres by 60<U+2013>61 metres (95.14<U+2013>98.43 ft by 196.85<U+2013>200.13 ft). The [[Hockey rink#Lines|center line]] divides the ice in half,<ref name="lines">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule05.html |title=Division of ice surface |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-06-08 |year=2005}}</ref> and is used to judge icing violations. There are two [[Hockey rink#Lines|blue lines]] that divide the rink roughly into thirds, which divide the ice into two attacking and one neutral [[Hockey rink#Zones|zone]].<ref name="lines" /> Near the end of both ends of the rink, there is a thin red ''goal line'' spanning the width of the ice, which is used to judge [[Goal (hockey)|goal]]s and icing calls.

Starting in the 2005<U+2013>2006 season, after testing in the [[American Hockey League]], a trapezoidal area behind each goal net has been introduced.<ref name="crease">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule04.html |title=Goal crease |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-06-08 |year=2005}}</ref> The goaltender can only play the puck within that area or in front of the goal line; if the goaltender plays the puck behind the goal line and not in the trapezoidal area, a 2 minute minor penalty for delay of game is assessed by the referees.<ref name="crease_penalty">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/rulebook/rule31.html |title=Goalkeeper's Penalties |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-06-26 |year=2005}}</ref>

== Rules ==

: ''Main articles: [[National Hockey League rules]]''
While the National Hockey League follows the general rules of [[ice hockey]], it differs slightly from those used in international games organized by the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) such as the [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympics]]. Infractions of the rules can lead to either the stoppage of play in the case of [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]] and [[Icing (ice hockey)|icing]] calls, or a penalty call for more serious infractions.

During the [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|2004<U+2013>05 lockout]], the league changed some of the rules regarding being [[Offside (ice hockey)|offside]]. First, the league removed the "offside pass" or "two-line pass" rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's [[Hockey rink#Zones|defending zone]] was completed on the offensive side of the [[Hockey rink#Lines|center line]], unless the puck crossed the line before the player.<ref name="newoffside">{{cite web |title=Relaunching the Game |author=CBC sports |publisher=CBC.com |date=2005<U+2013>07<U+2013>22 |accessdate=2006-06-10 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/rule_changes.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the league reinstated the "tag-up offside" which allows an attacking player a chance to get back onside by returning to the neutral zone.<ref name="newoffside" /> The changes to the offside rule were one of several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring,<ref name="newoffside" /> which had been in decline since the expansion years of the mid-nineties.

Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how [[Icing (ice hockey)|icings]] are called. In the NHL, a [[Official (ice hockey)#Linesman|linesman]] stops play due to icing if a defending player (other than the goaltender) touches the puck before an attacking player is able to,<ref name="icing" /> in contrast to the IIHF rules where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line. As a result of the rule changes following the 2004<U+2013>05 lockout, when a team is guilty of icing the puck they are not allowed to make a line change before the following [[faceoff]].<ref name="icing">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/rules/rule65.html |title=Icing the puck |author=National Hockey League |publisher=NHL.com |accessdate=2006-06-08 |year=2005}}</ref>

The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules.

The NHL and the [[NHL Players' Association|NHLPA]] created a stringent anti-doping policy in the new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|CBA]] of September 2005. The policy provides for a 20-game penalty for a first positive test, 60 games for a second positive test, and a third offence resulting in a permanent ban.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050928/NHL_doping_050928?s_name=&no_ads= |title=NHL unveils new drug testing policy |date=2005<U+2013>09<U+2013>28 |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Scott |last=Laurie |publisher=CTV}}</ref>

{{NHL Labelled Map|float=right}}
The National Hockey League originated in 1917 with four teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, [[List of defunct NHL teams|reductions, and relocations]] currently consists of 30 teams, 24 of which are based in the United States and six in Canada. The [[Montreal Canadiens]] are the most successful franchise with 24 [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup championships]] (23 as an NHL team, 1 as an NHA team); in the four major [[Major professional sports league#North American leagues|North American professional sports leagues]] the [[Montreal Canadiens]] are only surpassed in the number of championships by the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]], who have two more. The next most successful franchise is the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] with 13 Stanley Cup championships, but they have not won one since 1967. The [[Detroit Red Wings]], with 11 Stanley Cup championships, is the most successful American franchise. The longest streak of winning the Stanley Cup in consecutive years is five, held by the Montreal Canadiens from 1955<U+2013>56 to 1959<U+2013>60; the [[New York Islanders]] (1980<U+2013>1983) and the Montreal Canadiens (1976<U+2013>1979) have four-year championship streaks.<ref name="list_stanley_cup">{{cite web |title=Stanley Cup Winners |url=http://proicehockey.about.com/od/stanleycupbunker/a/stanley_cuplist.htm |first=Jamie |last=Fitzpatrick |publisher=about.com |accessdate=2006-06-26 |year=2006}}</ref> The 1977 edition of the Montreal Canadiens, the second of four straight Stanley Cup champions, was named by [[ESPN]] as the second greatest sports team of all-time.<ref name="greatest team">{{cite web |title=The 10 greatest teams |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/greatteams.html |author=ESPN |publisher=ESPN.com |date=1999<U+2013>12<U+2013>31 |accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref>

Of all the major leagues in North America, the NHL is the only league to field teams that play in two countries' capital cities, [[Ottawa]] and [[Washington, DC]].

The current league organization divides the teams into two conferences. Each conference has three divisions, and each division has five teams. The current organization has roots in the [[1998<U+2013>99 NHL season|1998<U+2013>99 season]] where a league realignment added two divisions to bring the total number of divisions to six; the current team alignment began with the [[2000<U+2013>01 NHL season|2000<U+2013>2001 season]] when the Minnesota Wild and the Columbus Blue Jackets joined the league as expansion teams.

The Detroit Red Wings and the Columbus Blue Jackets have the distinction of being the only teams in the Western Conference that are located in the eastern time zone.  This results in significantly increased travel time for both teams.

== Season structure ==
[[Image:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Stanley Cup]], on display at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], is awarded to the league champion.]]
{{See also|List of NHL seasons|Season structure of the NHL}}
The National Hockey League season is divided into an exhibition season (September), a [[regular season]] (from the first week in October through early to mid April) and a postseason (the [[Stanley Cup playoffs]]). During the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. The Stanley Cup playoffs, which goes from April to the beginning of June, is an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the [[Stanley Cup]] champion. Beginning in 2007, the NHL regular season has begun in Europe while teams not involved complete their exhibition schedule. The 2008&ndash;2009 season began with the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] facing off against the [[Ottawa Senators]] in Stockholm, Sweden and the [[New York Rangers]] taking on the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in Prague, Czech Republic.

In the regular season, each team plays 82 games; 41 games at home and 41 on the road.  Each team plays 24 games in its [[Division (sport)|division]] (6 against each divisional opponent), and 40 games against non-divisional intra-conference opponents.  That is, 4 games against each team in its conference, but not in its own division.  Each team plays every team in the other conference at least once (one game each against 12 teams and two games against the remaining 3 teams).  Prior to the 2008-2009 season, teams played 32 games within their division (8 games against each team in the division) and 10 inter-conference games (1 game against each team in two of the three divisions in the opposite conference).<ref>{{cite web |title=NHL ramps up rivalries |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/indepth/cba/features/schedule_changes.html |author=CBC Sports Online |publisher=CBC.com |date=2005<U+2013>07<U+2013>27 |accessdate=2006-06-06}}</ref> The two divisions from the opposite conference which each team plays against were rotated every year, much like [[interleague play]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. As with the current system, each team played 4 games against the other 10 teams in its conference, but not in its own division.

Points are awarded for each game, where two points are awarded for a win, one point for losing in [[Overtime (hockey)|overtime]] or a shootout, and zero points for a loss in regulation. Among major professional sports leagues, the NHL is the only one to award a team points for losing in overtime.

At the end of the regular season, the team that finishes with the most points in each division is crowned the division champion. The league's overall leader is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]]. The three division champions along with the five other teams in each conference with the next highest number of points, for a total of 8 teams in each conference, qualify for the [[playoff]]s. The division winners are seeded one through three (even if a non-division winner has a higher point total), and the next five teams with the best records in the conference are seeded four through eight.<ref name="nhl_playoff_format">{{cite web |publisher=NHL.com |title=Playoff formats |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-06-06 |url=http://www.nhl.com/hockeyu/history/cup/formats.html}}</ref> The [[Season structure of the NHL|Stanley Cup playoffs]] is an elimination [[tournament]], where two teams battle to win a [[Playoff format#Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven]] series in order to advance to the next round. The first round of the playoffs, or conference quarterfinals, consists of the first seed playing the eighth seed, the second playing the seventh, third playing the sixth, and the fourth playing the fifth.<ref name="nhl_playoff_format" /> In the second round, or conference semifinals, the NHL re-seeds the teams, with the top remaining conference seed playing against the lowest remaining seed, and the other two remaining conference teams pairing off. In the third round, the conference finals, the two remaining teams in each conference play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals.

In each round the higher-ranked team is said to be the team with the [[Home team|home-ice advantage]]. Four of the seven games are played at this team's home venue <U+2014> the first and second, and, when necessary, the fifth and seventh games <U+2014> with the other games played at the lower-ranked team's home venue. In the Stanley Cup Finals, the team with the most points during the regular season is given home-ice advantage, regardless of where each team ranks in their own conference.

{{Main|National Hockey League awards}}
The National Hockey League presents a number of trophies each year. The most prestigious team award is the [[Stanley Cup]], which is awarded to the league champion at the end of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The team that has the most points in the regular season is awarded the [[Presidents' Trophy]]. There are also numerous trophies that are awarded to players based on their statistics during the regular season; they include, among others, the [[Art Ross Trophy]] for the league scoring champion (goals and assists), the [[Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy]] for the goal-scoring leader, and the [[William M. Jennings Trophy]] for the goalkeeper(s) for the team with the fewest goals against them. For the 2008<U+2013>09 season these statistics-based trophies will be awarded to [[Evgeni Malkin]] of the Pittsburgh Penguins, [[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the Washington Capitals, and, dually, [[Tim Thomas (Ice Hockey)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Emmanuel Fernandez|Manny Fernandez]] of the Boston Bruins respectively.

The other player trophies are voted on by the [[Professional Hockey Writers' Association]] or the team general managers.<ref name="awards">{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=301911 |title=NHL announces 2006<U+2013>07 trophy finalists |publisher=NHL.com |date=2007<U+2013>05<U+2013>01 |accessdate=2007-06-19}}</ref> The most prestigious individual award is the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] which is awarded annually to the [[Most Valuable Player]]; the voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association to judge the player who is the most valuable to his team during the regular season. The [[Vezina Trophy]] is awarded annually to the person deemed the best goalkeeper as voted on by the general managers of the teams in the NHL. The [[James Norris Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top defenceman, the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] is awarded annually to the top rookie, and the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] is awarded to the player deemed to combine the highest degree of skill and sportsmanship; all three of these awards are voted on by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association.

In addition to the regular season awards, the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] is awarded annually to the most valuable player during the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs. Furthermore, the top coach in the league wins the [[Jack Adams Award]] as selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association. The National Hockey League publishes the names of the top three vote getters for all awards, and then names the award winner during the NHL Awards Ceremony.<ref name="awards" />

One interesting aspect for the trophies in the NHL is that the same trophy is reused every year for each of its awards. The [[Stanley Cup]], much like its [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] [[Grey Cup|counterpart]], is unique in this aspect, as opposed to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]], [[Larry O'Brien Trophy]], and [[World Series Trophy|Commissioner's Trophy]], who have new ones made every year for that year's champion. Despite only one trophy being used, the names of the teams winning and the players are engraved every year on the Stanley Cup. The same can also be said for the other trophies reissued every year.

Players, coaches, officials, and team builders who have had notable careers are eligible to be voted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]. Players cannot enter until three years have passed since their last professional game, the shortest such time period of any major sport. One unique consequence has been Hall of Fame members (specifically, [[Gordie Howe]], [[Guy Lafleur]], and [[Mario Lemieux]]) coming out of retirement to play once more.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roy on deck for 2006, 'mayhem' in 2007 |publisher=tsn.ca |url=http://www.tsn.ca/classic/news_story.asp?ID=142315&hubName= |author=Canadian Press |date=2005<U+2013>11<U+2013>7 |accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref> In the past, however, if a player was deemed significant enough, the pending period would be waived; only ten individuals have been honoured in this manner.<ref name="waiver">{{cite web |title=Wayne Gretzky signs five-year contract as head coach |url=http://www.phoenixcoyotes.com/news/story_details.php?ID=5063 |publisher=phoenixcoyotes.com |author= phoenixcoyotes.com |date=2006<U+2013>05<U+2013>31 |accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> In 1999, [[Wayne Gretzky]] became the last player to have the three-year restriction waived,<ref name="waiver" /> and after Gretzky's induction, the NHL declared that he would be the last to have the waiting period omitted.

The reigning [[Hart Trophy]] winner (given to the league's most valuable player) is [[Alexander Ovechkin]].

The top five point scoring forwards in the [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09 season]] were [[Evgeni Malkin]], Alexander Ovechkin, [[Sidney Crosby]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]] and [[Zach Parise]]. The top goal scorer was Alexander Ovechkin with 56, followed by [[Jeff Carter]] (46) and Zach Parise (45). The top four scoring defencemen were [[Mike Green (ice hockey)|Mike Green]], [[Andrei Markov (ice hockey)|Andrei Markov]], [[Nicklas Lidstr<U+00F6>m|Nicklas Lidstrom]], and [[Scott Niedermayer]].  The top goaltenders (by wins) were [[Miikka Kiprusoff]] (45), [[Evgeni Nabokov]] (41), [[Cam Ward]] (39), [[Henrik Lundqvist]] (38), [[Niklas Backstrom]] (37).

==Origin of players==
In addition to Canadian and American born and trained players, who have historically composed a large majority of NHL rosters, the NHL also draws players from an expanding pool of other nations where organized and professional hockey is played. Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]] of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]], restrictions on the movement of hockey players from this region have lessened and there has been a large influx of European players into the NHL.  Many of the league's top players today come from these European countries, including: [[Alexander Ovechkin]], [[Ilya Kovalchuk]], [[Pavel Datsyuk]], and [[Evgeni Malkin]].<ref name="Europe">{{cite web |title=New world order: as the Olympics have shown, the influx of players from across the Atlantic brought changes to the NHL game |publisher=The Sporting News |date=2002<U+2013>02<U+2013>25 |accessdate=2006-06-11 |first=Larry |last=Wigge |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_8_226/ai_83450464}}</ref> European players were drafted and signed by NHL teams in an effort to bring in more "skilled offensive players".<ref name="europe2">{{cite web |title=Canadians left behind as NHL goes for firepower |publisher=Canadian Press |date=199<U+2013>06<U+2013>27 |accessdate=2006-06-11 |first=Bill |last=Beacon |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/HockeyNHLDraft99/jun27_can.html}}</ref> Although recently there has been a decline in European players as more American players enter the league.<ref name="More Americans?">{{cite web |title=NHL landscape changes |publisher=IIHF |date=2008<U+2013>05<U+2013>10 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |first=ANDREW |last=PODNIEKS |url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/browse/2/article/nhl-landscape-changes.html?tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=187&cHash=5abfb28b5e/}}</ref>  The addition of European players changed the style of play in the NHL and European style hockey has been integrated in to the NHL game.<ref name="Europe" /> Conversely Canadian coaches and the Canadian style of play have been embraced by many European countries.

==Television and radio==
===Canada===
In Canada, National Hockey League games are aired nationally by the [[CBC Television|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) and [[NHL on TSN|The Sports Network]] (TSN). Regional games are broadcast by a number of networks including [[Rogers Sportsnet]] (RSN). French language games are broadcast by the [[R<U+00E9>seau des sports]] (RDS) and [[R<U+00E9>seau Info-Sports]] (RIS), but no longer on [[La Soir<U+00E9>e du hockey|Radio-Canada]] (the French-language counterpart of the CBC), a change which has caused controversy in French Canada. The program ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', usually aired on Saturday nights on CBC, is a long-standing Canadian tradition dating to 1952,<ref name="hnic1">{{cite web |author=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC.ca |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hnic/seasoninfo.html |title=HNIC in 2005<U+2013>06 |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref><ref name="hnic2">{{cite web |author=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC.ca |title=Hockey Night in Canada: A history of excellence |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/hnic/histrad.html |year=2005 |accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> and even prior to that on radio since the 1920s.

===United States===
In the United States NHL games are aired nationally by [[The NHL on Versus|Versus]] (previously the "Outdoor Life Network" and "OLN"), and by [[NHL on NBC|NBC]].<ref name="nysun">{{cite web |first=Evan |last=Weiner |publisher=nysun.com |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34542 |title= Don't Believe the Gripe: The NHL Is Back |date=2006<U+2013>06<U+2013>16 |accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref> NBC replaced the previous over-the-air network, [[The NHL on ABC|ABC]], and has a revenue-sharing agreement with the NHL. Versus replaced [[ESPN National Hockey Night|ESPN]] as the cable network; [[Comcast]], which owns Versus, offered a two-year $120 million agreement, while ESPN offered a revenue sharing agreement.<ref name="nysun" />

[[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] had about 20 million fewer subscribers than ESPN when the NHL started on Versus, but Comcast switched Versus from a digital tier to basic cable to make NHL games available to more cable subscribers.<ref name="nysun" /> For Versus the NHL coverage was a good addition as Versus' [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]] grew by about 275% when it showed an NHL game.

The [[2007 Stanley Cup Finals]] were the lowest rated in the United States in history. As a whole, the television ratings on NBC were down 20% from the 2006 series<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2897126 ESPN - Ratings for Stanley Cup finals down 20 percent - NHL]</ref>, with Game 3's coverage on NBC garnering a mere 1.1 rating<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2894490 ESPN - Game 3 equals NBC's lowest rating ever for prime-time program - NHL]</ref> (approximately 1,205,600 households), making it the lowest rated prime-time broadcast in the network's history. However, coverage in Canada on CBC pulled in 2,608,000, 2,378,000, and 2,553,000 (for Games 1, 2, and 3 respectively), slightly higher than their numbers for the first three games in 2006. Comparatively, in 1994, when the New York Rangers were involved, Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals posted a rating of 6.9.<ref>{{cite web |title=NHL ratings toppling like dominoes |first=Tom |last=Reed |url=http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/hockey/14828592.htm |publisher=Akron Beacon Journal |accessdate=2006-06-15 |date=2006<U+2013>06<U+2013>05}}</ref>

Although 2007 saw low Stanley Cup Finals ratings, the 2008 series between Detroit and Pittsburgh drew one of the highest Stanley Cup ratings ever with strong 4.4 as the high overnight rating.

[[XM Satellite Radio]] is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL, as of July 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[XM Satellite Radio]] |date=2007-06-28 |title=XM to Become Exclusive Satellite Radio Carrier of NHL |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=1466 |accessdate=2007-06-28}}</ref> Between September 2005 and June 2007, the NHL's broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout. XM used to broadcast more than 80% of NHL games, including all the play-offs and finals. Starting with the 2007<U+2013>08 season, XM broadcasts every game.

===Outside of North America===
Outside of North America, NHL games are broadcast across Europe on [[ESPN America]] which takes feeds from Versus, FSN, TSN and CBC (including Hockey Night in Canada), and MSG. Games can also be seen in the UK on [[Five (channel)|Five]], on [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] in Australia, on [[SKY Sport (Italy)|SKY Sport]] in Italy and on [[Viasat Sport]] in Russia.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}

== Popularity ==
The NHL is considered one of the four major professional sports leagues in the North America, along with [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], and the [[National Basketball Association]]. Hockey has the smallest total fan base of the four leagues, the smallest revenue from television, and the least sponsorship.<ref name="affluent">[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0408/feature_sports.shtml Champions of the Turnstiles]</ref> However the league is very prominent in Canada, where hockey is the most popular of these four major sports. While the NHL does not hold one of the largest fan bases in North America, it does hold one of the most affluent fan bases.<ref name="affluent"/> Studies by the [[Sports Marketing Group]] conducted from 1998 to 2004 show that the NHL's fan base is much more affluent than that of the [[PGA Tour]].<ref>http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910221&slug=1267313</ref>

The NHL estimates that fully half of its fan base roots for teams in outside markets. Beginning in 2008, under the direction of [[Chief Operating Officer]] [[John Collins (football)|John Collins]], the NHL began a shift toward using digital technology to market to fans to capitalize on this. As a result, in 2009 the NHL drew a record number of sponsors and television viewers.<ref name=JohnCollins/>
