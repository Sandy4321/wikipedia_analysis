The '''History of [[Gaza]]''' spans 4,000 years during which it was ruled and populated by various dynasties, empires, and peoples.<ref name="Filfil"/> Originally a [[Canaan]]ite settlement, it fell under the control of the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]]s for roughly 350 years before being conquered by the [[Philistines]], who made it one of the principal cities of their [[pentapolis]] in the 12th century BCE. Gaza fell under the domain of the [[Assyrian empire]] in 730 BCE, and subsequently, that of the Persian [[Sassanid Dynasty]]. [[Alexander the Great]] besieged the city for five months before finally capturing it in 332 BCE. Most of the inhabitants were killed during the assault, and the city, which became a center for [[Hellenic|Hellenistic]] learning and philosophy, was resettled by nearby [[Bedouin]] [[Arab]]s. The city was again besieged by the [[Hasmonean]]s in 96 BCE.

After its incorporation into the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BCE, Gaza was rebuilt under the command of [[Pompey Magnus]], and granted to [[Herod the Great]] thirty years later. Throughout the Roman period, Gaza maintained its prosperity, receiving grants from several different emperors. A 500-member senate governed the city, and a diverse array of Philistines, [[Greeks]], Romans, Canaanites, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Jew]]s, [[Egyptians]], [[Persian people|Persian]]s and Arabs populated the city. Conversion to [[Christianity]] in the city was spearheaded and completed under [[Porphyry of Gaza|Saint Porphyrius]], who destroyed its eight [[pagan]] temples between 396 and 420 CE. 

Gaza was the first city in [[Palestine]] to be conquered by the Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in 635 CE. The arrival of the [[Muslim]] rulers brought drastic changes, as its churches were transformed into [[mosques]], the population swiftly adopted [[Islam]] as their religion, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the official language. Under the Arab Muslims, the city went through periods of prosperity and decline. The [[Crusades|Crusader]]s wrested control of Gaza from the [[Fatimid]]s in 1100, and ruled until 1187, when the city was conquered by [[Saladin]] and the [[Ayyubid]]s. Gaza was in [[Mamluk]] hands by the late 13th century, and became the capital of a province that stretched from the [[Sinai Peninsula]] to [[Caesarea]]. By the time of its incorporation into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century, it was but a small village.

The Ottomans charged the Ridwan family with governance over the city in the early 16th century. In 1660, under Husayn Pasha, Gaza went through another "golden age" and was proclaimed the capital of Palestine. From the early 1800s, Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt and [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] conquered it in 1832. His brief rule ended in 1840, after the Ottomans defeated his forces outside the city. In 1917, the forces of the [[Triple Entente]] captured the city after a [[Third Battle of Gaza|third battle]] against the Ottoman forces there.

The 20th century began in Gaza with two destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. The city also expanded in the first half of this century under the rule of the [[British Mandate in Palestine]], and as part of the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan]], Gaza was assigned to the Arab state. As a result of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], it was held and administered by [[Egypt]], until the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] when it was occupied by [[Israel]]. Gaza was a center of political resistance in the [[First Intifada]], and under the [[Oslo Accords]] of 1993, it was assigned to be under the direct control of the newly-established [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In 2007, [[Hamas]] emerged as the victor in Palestinian factional fighting with [[Fatah]] in the city and in the wider [[Gaza Strip]] and has since been the sole governing authority there. Israel has [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockaded]] the Strip ever since and  launched an [[2008<U+2013>2009 Israel<U+2013>Gaza conflict|assault]] in 2008-2009, which it characterized as a response to [[Qassam rocket]] attacks. The bombardment and ground assault left over 1,300 people dead in the territory, and destroyed over 4,000 buildings.

==Bronze Age==
Settlement in the region of Gaza dates back to 3300-3000 BCE at Tell as-Sakan, a site located south of the present-day city, which began as an [[Ancient Egyptian]] fortress built in [[Canaan]]ite territory. Tell as-Sakan prospered as Canaanite cities began to trade agricultural goods with the Egyptians. However, when Egypt<U+2019>s economic interests shifted to the [[cedar]] trade with [[Lebanon]], Gaza's role was reduced to that of a port for ships carrying goods and it declined economically. The site was virtually abandoned and remained so throughout the [[Early Bronze Age II]].<ref name="Filfil">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=2564&ed=157&edid=157|title=The Other Face of Gaza: The Gaza Continuum|first=Rania|last=Filfil|first2=Barbara|last2=Louton|work=This Week in Palestine|publisher=This Week in Palestine|date=September 2008}}</ref>

Gaza enjoyed demographic and economic growth again when the local Canaanite population began to resettle Tell as-Sakan around 2500, but in 2250, the area experienced a total collapse of civilization and all of the cities in the Gaza region were abandoned by the 23rd century BCE. In its place emerged semi-nomadic cultures with pastoral camps made up of rustic family dwellings which continued to exist throughout the [[Early Bronze Age IV]]. An urban center known as [[Tell al-Ajjul]] began to arise inland along the Wadi Ghazza riverbed. During the [[Middle Bronze Age]], Tell as-Sakan was the southernmost locality in Palestine, serving as a fort, and by 1650 BCE, while Egypt was occupied by the Canaanite [[Hyksos]], a second city developed on the ruins of the first Tell as-Sakan. This city was destroyed about a century later, when the Hyksos were routed from Egypt. Egypt settled Gaza once again and Tell al-Ajjul rose for the third time in the 15th century BCE. The city finally ceased to exist in the 14th century, at the end of the Bronze Age.<ref name="Filfil"/>

==Ancient period==

A city which would become present-day Gaza began to develop on the site of Tell al-Ajjul. This city served as Egypt<U+2019>s administrative capital in [[Canaan]], and was the residence of the Egyptian governor of the region. A caravan point of strategic importance from the earliest times, it was constantly involved in the wars between Egypt and [[Levant|Syria]] and the [[Mesopotamia]]n powers, and appeared frequently in Egyptian and Assyrian records. Under [[Tuthmosis III]], it is mentioned on the Syrian-Egyptian caravan route and in the [[Amarna letters]] as "Azzati". Gaza was in Egyptian hands for 350 years, until it was conquered by the [[Philistine]]s, a sea-faring people with cultural links to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], in the 12th century BCE. It then became a part of the [[pentapolis]]; a league of the Philistines' five most important city-states.<ref name="STF-J">{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/123discuss.html |title=Gaza - (Gaza, al -'Azzah) |date=2000-12-19 |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

[[Alexander the Great]] besieged Gaza<U+2014>the last city to resist his conquest on his path to Egypt<U+2014>for five months, finally capturing it 332 BCE.<ref name="STF-J"/> Led by a eunuch named Batis and defended by [[Arab]] mercenaries, Gaza withstood the siege for two months, until it was overcome by storm. The defenders, mostly local elements, fought to the death and the women and children were taken as captives. The city was resettled by neighboring [[Bedouin]]s,<ref>Bury, John Bagnell.''The Cambridge Ancient History''. [[Cambridge University Press]], p. 147.</ref> who were sympathetic to Alexander's rule. He then organized the city into a ''[[polis]]'' or "[[city-state]]" and [[Greek culture]] took root in Gaza which gained a reputation as a flourishing center of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] learning and philosophy.<ref name="Ring and Salkin">Ring and Salkin, 1994, p.287.</ref><ref name="Doughty">{{cite web |url=http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=1958&ed=133&edid=133 |title=Gaza: Contested Crossroads |accessdate=2009-01-30 |last=Doughty |first=Dick |date=November 2006 |publisher=This Week in Palestine}}</ref> Belonging at first to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic kingdom]], it passed after 200 BCE to the [[Seleucid]]s.<ref name="STF-J"/> 

In the 1st century BCE and the first half of the 1st century CE, it was the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port of the [[Nabateans]], whose caravans arrived there from [[Petra]] or from [[Elat]]h on the [[Red Sea]]. In 96 BCE, the [[Hasmonean]] king [[Alexander Jannaeus]] besieged the city for a year. The inhabitants, who had hoped for help from the Nabatean king [[Aretas II]], were killed and their city destroyed by Jannaeus when Aretas did not come to their aid.<ref name="STF-J"/><ref>(Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 360), (Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 364), (Josephus, Antiq. XIII, 357; War I,87)</ref>

==Roman and Byzantine rule==
Gaza was rebuilt by consul [[Aulus Gabinius]] after it was incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] in 63 BCE, under the command of [[Pompey Magnus]].<ref name="STF-J"/> Roman rule brought six centuries of relative peace and prosperity to the city<U+2014>which became a busy port and locus of trade between the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin"/> In the [[New Testament]], it is mentioned as being on the caravan route to [[History of Roman Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>Acts 8:26</ref> Granted to [[Herod the Great]] by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Augustus]] in 30 CE, Gaza formed a separate unit within his kingdom, and Cosgabar, the governor of [[Idumea]], was in charge of the city's affairs. On the division of Herod's kingdom, it was placed under the proconsul of Syria.<ref name="STF-J"/> After Herod's death in 4 BCE, Augustus annexed to the Province of Syria. In 66, Gaza was burned down by the Jews in their rebellion against the Romans, however, it remained an important city, even more so after the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Titus]] the following year.<ref name="Dowling1">Dowling, 1913, p.33.</ref> Titus passed through Gaza on his march toward to Jerusalem, and again in his return. The establishment of the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]] restored trade links with [[Petra]] and [[Aqaba|Aila]].<ref name="Meyer4">Meyer, 1907, p.58.</ref>

Throughout the Roman period, Gaza was a prosperous city and received grants and attention from several emperors.<ref name="STF-J"/> A 500-member senate governed Gaza, and a diverse variety of Philistines, Greeks, Romans, Canaanites, [[Phoenicia]]ns, Jews, Egyptians, Persians and Bedouin populated the city. Gaza's mint stamped out coins adorned with the busts of gods and emperors.<ref name="Doughty"/> During his visit in 130 BCE,<ref name="mah"/> Emperor Hadrian, who favored Gaza,<ref name="Meyer4"/> personally inaugurated wrestling, boxing and oratorical competitions in Gaza's new stadium, which soon became known from [[Alexandria]] to [[Damascus]]. The city was adorned with many pagan temples<U+2014>the main cult being that of [[Dagon#Marnas|Marnas]]. Other temples were dedicated to [[Zeus]], [[Helios]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Apollo]], [[Athene]] and the local deity Tyche.<ref name="STF-J"/> 

===Advent of Christianity===
[[Christianity]] began to spread throughout Gaza around 250 CE initiated by [[Philip the Arab]], first in the port of Maiuma, but later into the city. The religion faced obstacles as it spread through the inland population because pagan worship was strong. In 299, an unverified number of local Christians who assembled in Gaza to hear the Scriptures read were seized and mutilated by the Romans.<ref name="Meyer60">Meyer, 1907, p.60.</ref> Also, its Christians were harshly repressed during the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in 303. The first bishop of Gaza was Philemon, believed to have been one of the 72 disciples, but the first cleric was Saint Silvanus who, during the persecution by [[Maximian|Maximinianus]] in 310, was arrested along with about 30 other Christians, and condemned to death.<ref name="STF-J"/> 

The official recognition of Christianity by [[Constantine I]] did not increase sympathy of the religion in Gaza. Although Gaza was represented by Bishop Asclepas in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the vast majority of its inhabitants continued to worship the native gods.<ref name="Meyer60"/> As the Roman Empire was crumbling at this time, Gaza remained unaffected.<ref name="Ring and Salkin"/> At this time, the inhabitants of Maiuma converted to Christianity ''en masse''. [[Constantine II]] decided to separate it from pagan Gaza in 331, giving Maiuma its own [[episcopal see]].<ref name="Meyer60"/> [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] reversed the process during his reign in the latter half of the 4th century. Although Maiuma had its own bishop, clergy, and diocesan territory, it shared its magistrates and administration with Gaza.<ref>Bitton-Ashkelony and Kofsky, 2004, p.45.</ref> Upon Julian's death, Maiuma's independence was restored and the rivalry between it and Gaza intensified.<ref name="Meyer60"/> 

During most of the 4th century, the Christian community was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members were not allowed to hold political office.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.63.</ref> However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under [[Porphyry of Gaza|Saint Porphyrius]] between 396 and 420.<ref name="STF-J"/> In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphryrius to undertake more measures.<ref name="Meyer">Meyer, 1907, pp.63-64.</ref> As a result of his persuasion, Empress [[Aelia Eudocia]] commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406.<ref name="Pringle">Pringle, 1993, p.208</ref> Persecution against Christian did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously.<ref name="Meyer"/> Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy of rhetoric, including 6th century scholar [[Procopius of Gaza]].<ref name="STF-J"/> The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.<ref name="Pringle"/> 

Depicted in the mosaic [[Map of Madaba]] of 600, Gaza was the most important political and commercial center on the southern coast of [[Palestine]].<ref name="STF-J2"/> Its northern municipal border was marked by Wadi al-Hesi, just before Ashkelon, and its southern boundary is unknown, but Gaza's jurisdiction did not reach [[Rafah|Raphia]]. The towns of [[Beit Lahiya|Bethelea]], [[Jabalia|Asalea]], [[Gerar]]it and [[Kissufim]] were included in Gaza's territories.<ref>Bitton-Ashkelony and Kofsky, 2004, pp.43-46.</ref> Its large representation, approximately half of which is preserved, cannot be easily explained, mainly because only small tentative excavations have been made there and because Byzantine Gaza is covered by the still inhabited Old City.<ref name="STF-J2">{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/123discuss.html |title=Excerpt in Gaza (1992), pages 75-76)- (Gaza, al -'Azzah) |accessdate=2009-01-19 |last=Donner |first=Herbert |date=[[2000-12-19]] |publisher=Studium Biblicum Franciscanum - Jerusalem |accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

==Arab Caliphate==
===Rashidun rule===
There were already converts to [[Islam]] among the city's [[Greek language|Greek-speaking]] Christian population before Gaza's capitulation to the [[Muslim]]s. At the near end of the Byzantine era, Gaza had become the home of an increasingly influential group of Arab traders from [[Mecca]], including [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], who later became the second [[caliph|ruler]] of the [[Islamic Caliphate]]. [[Muhammad]] visited the city more than once before being a prophet of [[Islam]].<ref name="Doughty"/>

In 634, Gaza was quickly besieged and captured by the [[Rashidun army]] under general [['Amr ibn al-'As]], with assistance from [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], following the [[Battle of Ajnadayn]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in central Palestine.<ref name="Ring and Salkin"/><ref>[[al-Biladhuri]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.xix. Al-Biladhuri lists the cities captured by Amr ibn al-'As as Ghazzah (Gaza), Sebastiya ([[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], [[Nabulus]], Amwas ([[Imwas]]), Kaisariyya ([[Caesarea]]), [[Yibna]], [[Lod|Ludd]] (Lydda), Rafh ([[Rafah]]), [[Bayt Jibrin]], and Yaffa ([[Jaffa]]).</ref> During the siege, the city's Jewish community fought alongside the Byzantine garrison.<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Stillman |title=The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book |publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America |location=Philadelphia |year=1979 |isbn=1590454936  |page=24}}</ref> The easy victory of al-'As is attributed to a combination of Arab strategy, Byzantine weakness, and the influence of Gaza<U+2019>s Arab residents.<ref name="Doughty"/> Gaza was the first city of Palestine to be conquered by the Muslims and the only one to be captured during the reign of the caliph [[Abu Bakr]].<ref name="Abu-Lughod">Dumper and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.155.</ref> Believed to be the site where Muhammad's great grandfather [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf]]<U+2014>who also lived as a merchant in Gaza<U+2014>was buried, the city was not destroyed by the victorious [[Rashidun army|Arab army]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin2">Ring and Salkin, 1994, p.289.</ref> 

The arrival of the Muslim Arabs brought drastic changes to Gaza; its churches were transformed into mosques, including the Cathedral of John the Baptist (previously the Temple of Marnas) which became the [[Great Mosque of Gaza]]. The population swiftly adopted Islam as their religion, and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the official language of the city.<ref name="Ring and Salkin2"/> The Christian population was reduced to an insignificant minority and the [[Samaritan]] residents deposited their property with their high priest and fled the city east upon the Muslim conquest.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.71.</ref> Gaza was placed under the administration of [[Jund Filastin]] ("District of Palestine") during Rashidun rule, and continued to be a part of the district under the successive caliphates of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s.<ref>[[al-Muqaddasi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.39.</ref>

===Arab dynasties===
In 672, an earthquake struck Gaza<U+2014>now under the Umayyad dynasty, but there are no details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were [[jizya|taxed]], though their worship and trade continued, as noted in the writings of the bishop [[Willibald|Saint Willibald]], who visited the city in 723.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.76.</ref> The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine and the arrival of the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law.<ref name="mah"/> In 767, [[Al-Shafi'i|Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]] was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent ''[[fiqh]]s'' (schools of law) of [[Sunni Islam]], named [[Shafi'i]] after him.<ref name="Gil">Gil, 1992, p.292.</ref> 

In 796, the city was laid waste during a civil war by the Arab tribes of the area.<ref name="Dowling2">Dowling, 1913, p.37.</ref> Gaza apparently recovered by the 9th century according to [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[al-Istakhri]] who wrote that merchants grew rich there "for this place was a great market for the people of the [[Hejaz]]."<ref>[[al-Istakhri]] and [[Ibn Hauqal]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442.</ref> A Christian writer, writing in 867, described it as "rich in all things".<ref name="Meyer4"/> Gaza's port, however, occasionally succumbed to neglect under Arab rule and an overall decline in commerce followed because of infighting among Palestine's rulers and Bedouin bandits who disrupted overland trade routes towards the city.<ref name="Ring and Salkin2"/> 

From 868 to 905 the [[Tulunid]]s ruled Gaza,<ref name="Filfil"/> and around 909, the influence of the [[Fatimid]]s from Egypt started to grow, leading to a slow decline of the city. The [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] was introduced to the area, arriving from [[India]] in 943.<ref name="mah"/> In 977, the Fatimids established an agreement with the [[Seljuk Turks]], whereby the Fatimids would control Gaza and the land south of it, including [[Egypt]].<ref>Gil, 1992, p.349.</ref> By the 985 CE, while under Fatimid rule, the Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] described Gaza as "a large town lying on the highroad to Egypt on the border of the desert. There is here a [[Great Mosque of Gaza|beautiful mosque]], also to be seen is the monument for the Khalif Umar."<ref>[[al-Muqaddasi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442.</ref> The [[Arabic language]] poet, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Ghazzi was born in the city in 1049.<ref name="Meyer4">Meyer, 1907, p.78.</ref>

==Crusader and Ayyubid rule==
[[Image:Gold Market, Gaza City.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Gold Market]] in Gaza dates from the Mamluk period]]

The Crusaders wrested control of Gaza from the Fatimids in 1100. According to the chronicler [[William of Tyre]], the Crusaders found it uninhabited and in ruins. Unable to totally refortify the hilltop on which Gaza was built, due to a lack of resources, King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]] built a small castle there in 1149. The possession of Gaza completed the military encirclement of the Fatimid-held city of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] to the north. After the castle's construction, Baldwin granted it and the surrounding region to the [[Knights Templar]].<ref name="Pringle"/> He also had the Great Mosque converted into the Cathedral of Saint John.<ref name="mah"/><ref name="Pringle"/> 

In 1154, the Arab traveler [[al-Idrisi]] wrote Gaza "is today very populous and in the hands of the Crusaders."<ref>[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442.</ref> William of Tyre confirms that in 1170, a civilian population was persuaded to occupy the area outside the castle and establish feeble fortifications and gates surrounding the community.<ref name="Pringle"/> That same year, King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] withdrew Gaza's Templars to assist him against an Egypt-based [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] force led by [[Saladin]] at nearby [[Deir al-Balah|Darum]]. However, Saladin evaded the Crusader force and assaulted Gaza instead, destroying the town built outside the castle's walls and killing its inhabitants after they were refused refuge in the castle, managed by [[Miles of Plancy]] at the time. Seven years later, the Templars prepared for another defense of Gaza against Saladin, but this time his forces fell on Ascalon. In 1187, following Ascalon's capitulation, the Templars surrendered Gaza in return for the release of their master [[Gerard of Ridefort]]. Saladin then ordered the destruction of the city's fortifications in 1191. A year later, after recapturing it, [[Richard the Lionheart]] apparently refortified the city, but the walls were dismantled as a result of the [[Treaty of Ramla]] agreed upon months later in 1193.<ref name="Pringle"/> 

According to geographer [[Abu al-Fida]], Gaza was a medium-sized city, possessing gardens and a seashore in the early 13th century.<ref>[[Abu al-Fida]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442.</ref> In 1222-23, it is recorded that Sanjar al-Jawali Abu Said was the ''mukkadam'' ("ruler") of Syria, inspector of the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] and [[Ibrahimi Mosque]], and the governor of Gaza, Jerusalem, and [[Hebron]]. He highly favored Gaza and turned it into a flourishing town, having built a horse-race course, a ''[[madrasa]]'' ("college"), a ''[[khan]]'' ("caravansary"), a ''maristan'' ("hospital"), and a castle for the city.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.83.</ref> The Ayyubids constructed the [[Shuja'iyya]] neighborhood<U+2014>the first extension of Gaza beyond the Old City.<ref>Haldimann and Humbert, 2007, p.195.</ref>

==Mamluk rule==
The Ayyubid period of rule virtually ended in 1260, after the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]]s under [[Hulagu Khan]] completely destroyed Gaza<U+2014>his southernmost point of conquest. Hulagu left his army in Gaza after being recalled due to the death of the Mongol emperor, and so the Mamluk general [[Baibars]] drove the Mongols out of the city and again defeated them at [[Baysan]] in the [[Galilee]]. He was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt on his way back from the battlefield after the assassination of [[Qutuz|Sultan Qutuz]]. Baibars passed through Gaza six times during his expeditions against the remnants of the Crusader states and the Mongols from 1263 to 1269.<ref name="Meyer2">Meyer, 1907, pp.85-86.</ref> The domination of the Mamluks started in 1277,<ref name="Ring and Salkin2"/> with Gaza being a mere village in the territory of [[Ramla]]. In 1279, Sultan [[Qalawun]] encamped in Gaza for fifty days while on a march against the Mongols.<ref name="Meyer2"/>

In 1293, his son [[al-Nasir Muhammad]] instituted Gaza as the capital of the province that bore its name, ''Mamlakat Ghazzah'' ("the Governorship of Gaza").<ref name="Meyer2"/> This province covered the coastal plain from [[Rafah]] in the south to just north of [[Caesarea]], extending in the east to the western slopes of [[Samaria]] and the [[Hebron Hills]]; its major towns were [[Qaqun]], [[Lod|Ludd]], and Ramla.<ref name="Sharon">Sharon, 1997, pp.XII-XIII.</ref> In 1294, an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks.<ref name="Ring and Salkin2"/> That same year Gaza was the center of a conspiracy against the [[List of rulers of Egypt|Sultan of Egypt]], which was detected and crushed before being carried out.<ref name="Meyer2"/>

The [[Syria]]n geographer [[al-Dimashqi]] described the city in 1300 as "so rich in trees it looks like a cloth of brocade spread out upon the land."<ref name="Doughty"/> He accounted to Gaza the cities and towns of Ascalon, Jaffa, Caesarea, [[Arsuf]], [[Deir al-Balah]], [[al-Arish]] (in the northern center of the [[Sinai Peninsula]]), Bayt Jibrin, [[Karatiyya]], Hebron and Jerusalem<U+2014>all of which had their own governors.<ref name="Meyer3"/> Gaza was one of the places returned to the allegiance of the exiled al-Nasir Muhammad; in 1310, he defeated the sultan [[Baibars II]] at Gaza, causing the latter to surrender his throne to him. Baibars was imprisoned in the city.<ref name="Meyer3">Meyer, 1907, p.87.</ref> 

In 1348, the [[Bubonic Plague]] spread to the city, killing the majority of its inhabitants, and in 1352, Gaza suffered from a destructive flood<U+2014>which was rare in that arid part of Palestine.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3">Ring and Salkin, 1994, p.290.</ref> However, in 1355, the [[Berber]] traveler [[Ibn Batutta]] visited the city and noted that it was "large and populous, and has many mosques. But there were no walls round it. There was here of old a fine Jami' Mosque (the Great Mosque), but the one present[ly] used was built by Amir Jawli."<ref>[[Ibn Batutta]] quoted in le Strange, 1890, p.442.</ref> Amir 'Alam Jawli was the Mamluk governor of Gaza from 1288 to 1319.<ref>Pringle, 1993, p.209.</ref> 

In the early 1380s, the governor of Gaza, Akboga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against the sultan [[Barquq]]. He was detected and exiled to [[Kerak]], and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, it fell into the hands of Ilboga Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. The city was taken without violence, as ibn Bakish met Nasiri at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The unseated Barquq regained his throne in 1388, and retook Gaza the next year.<ref>Meyers, 1907, pp.90-91.</ref> The Mamluks contributed a great deal to Gazan architecture by building mosques, Islamic schools, hospitals, caravansaries, and public baths, including [[Hamam as-Samarra]].<ref name="Filfil"/> In 1401, a swarm of locusts destroyed Gaza's crops.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> A battle between the rival Mamluk [[emir|ruler]]s Akberdy and Kansowah Khamsieh occurred in Gaza; Khamsieh had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful final stand.<ref>Meyers, 1907, p.97.</ref>

==Ottoman era==
===Early Ottoman rule and the Ridwan dynasty===
In 1516, Gaza<U+2014>by now a small town with an inactive port, ruined buildings and reduced trade<U+2014>was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> The Ottoman army quickly and efficiently crushed a small-scale uprising,<ref>Ze'evi, 1996, p.2.</ref> and the local population generally welcomed them as fellow [[Sunni Muslim]]s.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> 
Shortly after Palestine's quick submission to the Ottomans, it was divided into six districts, including the [[Liwa of Gaza|Sanjak of Gaza]] (District of Gaza) which stretched from [[Jaffa]] in the north to [[Bayt Jibrin]] in the west and Rafah in the south. The ''[[sanjak]]'' was a part of the larger [[Ottoman Syria|Wilayat Dimashq]] or the "Province of Syria".<ref>Doumani, 1995, p.35.</ref>

The first governor of Sanjak Gaza was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former [[jannissary]] who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a [[vizier]] and trusted aide of [[Suleyman I|Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent]].<ref>Ze'evi, 1996, p.52.</ref> He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by [[Selim II|Sultan Selim II]]. Mustafa died a short while later and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of [[Yemen]], became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming governor of [[Ethiopia]], [[Basra]], and [[Diyarbakir]] in that order, he successfully led a Ottoman contingent against [[Safavid Persia]] in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of [[Anatolia]] where he died in 1585.<ref name="Ze'evi">Ze'evi, 1996, p.40.</ref>

Although no explanation is provided in the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their [[Qasr al-Basha|castle]]. Ridwan Pasha's son Ahmad succeeded him and governed Gaza for thirty years, sometimes incorporating the ''sanjaks'' of [[Sanjak Nablus|Nablus]] and Jerusalem. He became Governor of Wilayat Dimashq in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in [[Istanbul]] and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control and knowledge of the Bedouin.<ref name="Ze'evi"/> He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel [[Fakhr ad-Din]] in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in [[Lebanon]], but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children. He led the Ridwans successfully militarily, however, he burdened the dynasty with heavy debt.<ref name="Ze'evi2">Ze'evi, 1996, p.41.</ref>

[[Image:Gaza (1881-1884) (A).jpg|thumb|right|Muslims studying the [[Qur'an]] with Gaza in the background, painting by [[Harry Fenn]]]]

'Arab Hasan's son Husayn Pasha was governor of Nablus and Jerusalem, and inherited the impoverished governorship of Gaza when his father died. He borrowed a large sum from the [[France|French]] in order to meet the heavy taxes imposed on the city by Hassan Aga, governor the Wilayat [[Sidon]]<U+2014>the province that Gaza belonged to.<ref name="Meyer">Meyer, 1907, p.98.</ref> Husayn's period in office was peaceful and prosperous for the city, and he gained a good reputation for he considerably reduced the strife between the nearby Bedouins and the settled population. He appointed his son Ibrahim to be governor of the Gaza and Jerusalem districts, but when the latter was killed during an expedition against the [[Druze]] in [[Mount Lebanon]] in 1660, Husayn resumed control of Gaza.<ref name="Ze'evi2"/> That year, Gaza was designated the capital of Palestine, indicating the city's rapid recovery. The Great Mosque was restored, and six other mosques constructed, while [[Turkish bath]]s and market stalls proliferated.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> Anonymous petitions sent to Istanbul complaining about Husayn's failure to protect the ''Hajj'' caravan and alleged pro-Christian tendencies,<ref name="Meyer"/> however, served as an excuse for the Ottoman government to depose him. He was soon imprisoned in [[Damascus]] and his assets confiscated by provincial authorities. He was later sent to Istanbul and died in prison there in 1663.<ref name="Ze'evi2"/> 

Husayn's brother Musa then governed Gaza into the early 1670s, implementing an anti-French and anti-Christian regime to appease the Ottoman government.<ref name="Meyer"/> Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office.<ref name="Ze'evi2"/>

In 1723, the Ottomans appointed Salih Pasha Tuqan of the [[Nablus]]-based Tuqan family to govern Gaza and two other ''sanjaks'' until his death in 1742.<ref>Doumani, 1995, p.38.</ref> In the 1750s, a local Bedouin tribes disposed of the plunder from a [[Mecca]]n caravan, consisting of 13,000 camel-loads of goods, into Gaza's markets, boosting the city's wealth. The attack on the caravan was a reprisal to the Ottomans who had recently replaced the governor of Damascus. In 1763, Gaza staged a revolt against the Turks.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.100</ref> Then, in November 1770, [[Ali Bey al-Kabir]], the rebellious Mamluk sultan of Egypt, sent troops to Gaza to aid [[Dhaher al-Omar]] in the [[Galilee]], helping him check the power of the Ottomans in the [[Levant]].<ref>Sabbagh, 2008, p.40.</ref> Gaza was briefly occupied by the [[French Army]] under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who referred to it as "the outpost of Africa, the door to Asia", in 1799.<ref>Meyer, 1907, p.101.</ref> Most of its inhabitants fled as a result. His forces easily razed the remains of the city walls (which had not been rebuilt since their destruction by Saladin), but abandoned the city after their failed [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] that same year. The duration of French influence in Gaza was too short to have a palpable effect.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/>

===Egyptian rule and Ottoman revival===
[[Image:Gaza painting - David Roberts.jpg|thumb|right|Painting of Gaza by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1839]]

Gaza was culturally dominated by neighboring Egypt from the early 1800s; [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832.<ref name="mah"/> Strangely, in 1833, Muhammad Ali instructed his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] not to purchase Gaza's cotton harvest (cotton production was Ali's main source of wealth and Egypt's production was low that year), instead allowing its residents to dispose of it how they wished.<ref>Doumani, 1995, p.102.</ref> 

American scholar [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] visited Gaza in 1838, describing it as a "thickly populated" town larger than Jerusalem, with its Old City lying upon a hilltop, while its suburbs laid on the nearby plain.<ref name="Robinson1">Robinson, 1841, p.37.</ref> He further stated that its soil was rich and supported groves of "delicious and abundant" apricots and mulberries. Although  Gaza's port was by then inactive, it benefited from trade and commerce because of its position on the caravan route between Egypt and Syria, as well as from the production of soap and cotton for trade with the Bedouin.<ref name="Robinson2">Robinson, 1841, p.39.</ref> The governor of Gaza at the time was Sheikh Sa'id.<ref name="Robinson1"/> Robinson noted that virtually all of Gaza's vestiges of ancient history and antiquity had disappeared due to constant conflict and occupation.<ref>Robinson, 1841, p.38.</ref> 

The Bubonic Plague struck again in 1839 and the city stagnated, as it lacked political and economic stability. In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began to recover from the plague.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> The [[Church of Saint Porphyrius]] was renovated in 1856,<ref name="Abu-Lughod">Dumper an Abu-Lughod, 2007, p.155.</ref> and in 1874, [[French people|French]] orientalist [[Charles Clermont-Ganneau]] visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.<ref name="Abu-Lughod"/>

==Twentieth century==
===British Mandate period===
[[Image:Gaza after WWI.jpg|thumb|right|Gaza after surrender to British forces, 1918]]

[[File:Great Mosque Gaza Facade.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Mosque of Gaza]] was heavily damaged during [[World War I]]]]

Although the first municipal council of Gaza was formed in 1893 under the chairmanship of Ali Khalil Shawa, modern mayorship began in 1906 with his son [[Said al-Shawa]], who was appointed mayor by Ottoman authorities.<ref>[http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ar&u=http://www.mogaza.org/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DGaza%2BMunicipality%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3DE5j%26pwst%3D1 Mayors of Gaza] Gaza Municipality.</ref> Like other regions and cities in Palestine at the time, Gaza was economically and politically dominated by a number of powerful clans, particularly the Shawa, Husseini, and Sourani families.<ref>Feldman, 2008, p.21.</ref> Two destructive earthquakes occurred in 1903 and 1914.<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> 

When [[World War I]] erupted in 1917, British forces were defeated by the Ottomans in the [[First Battle of Gaza|first]] and [[second Battle of Gaza]]. General [[Edmund Allenby]], leading the [[Allied Forces]], finally conquered Gaza in a [[Third Battle of Gaza|third battle]].<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> After the war, the [[League of Nations]] granted quasi-colonial authority over former Ottoman territories to [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]; Gaza was included in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merip.org/palestine-israel_primer/brit-mandate-pal-isr-prime.html|title=Palestine, Israel and the Arab-Israeli Conflict A Primer|accessdate=2009-01-19|publisher=Middle East Research Information Project}}</ref> 

The Jewish Quarter of Gaza was destroyed in the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and most of Gaza's fifty Jewish families fled the city. In the 1930s and 1940s, Gaza underwent major expansion, with new neighborhoods, such as [[Rimal]] and [[Zeitoun, Gaza|Zeitoun]] being built along the coast, and the southern and eastern plains. Areas damaged in the riots also went through reconstruction. Most of the funding for these developments were from international organizations and missionary groups.<ref name="Abu-Lughod"/>

===Egyptian and Israeli occupation===
In the 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan]], Gaza was assigned to the Arab state and during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], [[Egypt]] sent its [[Egyptian Army|forces]] to prevent Palestine's partition. They were unsuccessful in capturing intended territories, but held Gaza and the surrounding area, administering the city after the war. Gaza's growing population was augmented by an influx of [[Palestinian refugee|refugee]]s fleeing nearby cities, towns and villages that were captured by Israel. The Israelis occupied the [[Gaza Strip]] for four months during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name="Feldman"/> 

Upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces, Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] issued several reforms in Gaza, including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services, provision of housing and the establishment of local security forces. As in Egypt, political activity in Gaza was severely curtailed, but the government-sponsored Arab National Union was established in 1959, which gave the city's citizens a greater voice in national politics. When the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was founded in 1964, Nasser formally, but not practically, proclaimed that it would hold authority over Gaza, and a year later, conscription was instituted for the [[Palestinian Liberation Army]].<ref name="Feldman">Feldman, 2008, pp.8-9.</ref> 

Gaza was occupied by Israel in the 1967 [[Six Day War]] after the defeat of a coalition of Arab armies. Under Israeli occupation, existing structures of administration in Gaza would be maintained and administrative tasks would continue to be executed by Palestinian civil servants. Although this policy of "government but not administration" was declared, the Israeli military frequently interfered in the city's administration in order to control local resistance. In the immediate aftermath of the 1967 War, the military governor of Gaza threatened to dismiss the municipal council and cut off utility services if the local leadership was unable to force the residents of the city to turn in their weapons. This action was deemed excessive and was revoked by the Israeli military governor of the Gaza Strip, however. Organized armed struggle against Israel peaked between 1969 and 1971, but was largely crushed by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) under the command of [[Ariel Sharon]].<ref>Feldman, 2008, pp.226-227.</ref> 

In 1971, the Israeli government attempted to disperse the high concentration of Palestinian refugees in [[al-Shati camp]] and developed new housing schemes that resulted in the establishment of the northern [[Sheikh Radwan]] district. The [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement.<ref>Karmi and Cotran, 1999, p.33.</ref> In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, [[Rashad al-Shawa]], for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza.<ref>Feldman, 2008, p.228.</ref> Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the [[First Intifada]] in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising,<ref name="Ring and Salkin3"/> and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/roy10042006.html |title=The Economy of Gaza |accessdate=2009-01-19 |last=Roy |first=Sara |publisher=Counter Punch}}</ref>

==Palestinian control==
{{see also|Israel-Gaza conflict}}
In September 1993, leaders of Israel and the PLO signed the [[Oslo Accords]] calling for Palestinian administration of the Gaza Strip and the [[West Bank]] town of [[Jericho]], which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA) to administer and police the city.<ref name="Ring and Salkin"/> Led by [[Yasser Arafat]], the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly-established [[Palestinian National Council]] held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.<ref name="Abu-Lughod"/>

[[Image:Day 18 of War on Gaza.PNG|thumb|right|Palestinians in a Gaza neighborhood during the [[2008-2009 Israel-Gaza Conflict]] (Source: [[Al Jazeera English]])]]

In 2005 the Israeli cabinet withdrew its military and [[Israeli settlements|settlements]] from the Gaza Strip including the [[Philadelphi Route]], a narrow strip adjacent to the border with Egypt, as part of its [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|unilateral disengagement plan]]. Since the Palestinian organization [[Hamas]] won a surprise victory in the [[Palestinian elections of 2006]], it has been engaged in a violent power struggle with rival Palestinian organization [[Fatah]]. In 2007, Hamas  overthrew Fatah forces in the Gaza Strip and Hamas members were dismissed from the PNA government in the West Bank in response. Currently, Hamas has ''de facto'' control of the city and Strip.<ref name="BBC07">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6754499.stm |title=Abbas sacks Hamas-led government |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=[[2007-07-15]] |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=MMVIII}}</ref> Israel bombarded Gaza and nearby cities in the Gaza Strip in an air and ground assault codenamed "[[Operation Summer Rains]]" with the aim to end continued [[Qassam rocket]] attacks launched by Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]], and to secure the release of an [[Gilad Shalit|Israeli soldier]] captured by Palestinian militants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7274929.stm |title=Israeli Gaza operation 'not over' |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=[[2008-03-03]] |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=MMVIII}}</ref>

A human rights coalition charged March 6, 2008 that the humanitarian situation in Gaza had reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/05/israel.gaza.crisis.ap/index.html |title=Human rights coalition: Gaza at worst since 1967 |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=[[2008-03-06]] |work=[[CNN]] |publisher=}}</ref> On December 27-28, 2008 Israel commenced air strikes against Gaza, codenamed "[[Operation Cast Lead]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7811386.stm |title=Gaza conflict: Who is a civilian? |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=[[2009-01-05]] |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=MMIX}}</ref> Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military excursions and the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]]. By January 3, 2009, Israeli tanks and infantry were invading Gaza with air and naval support. Thirteen Israelis, including ten soldiers were killed, while, according to Palestinian sources, a total of more than 1,300 Palestinians were killed and 5,500 injured. In addition 4,000 buildings were destroyed and 20,000 damaged throughout the Gaza Strip.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7835981.stm |title=Rocket salvo tests Gaza ceasefire |accessdate=2009-01-19 |date=[[2009-01-16]] |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=MMIX}}</ref>
