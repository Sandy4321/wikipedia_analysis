'''''Last of the Summer Wine''''' is a British sitcom written by [[Roy Clarke]] that was broadcast on [[BBC One]]. ''Last of the Summer Wine'' premiered as an episode of ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' on 4 January 1973 and the first series of episodes followed on 12 November 1973. From 1983 to 2010, [[Alan J. W. Bell]] produced and directed all episodes of the show.  The BBC confirmed on 2 June 2010 that ''Last of the Summer Wine'' had been cancelled and the 31st series would be its last.<ref name="Independent 2010-06-02">{{cite news | first= | last= | title=BBC calls time on Last Of The Summer Wine | date=2010-06-02 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/bbc-calls-time-on-last-of-the-summer-wine-1989629.html | work =The Independent | publisher = | accessdate = 2010-06-02 }}</ref> Subsequently, the final episode aired on 29 August 2010.<ref name="How Not to Cry at Weddings">{{cite web | title=Last of the Summer Wine, Series 31, How Not to Cry at Weddings | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tmhyf| work =BBC One Programmes| publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2010-08-29 | language = }}</ref> Repeats of the show are broadcast in the UK on [[G.O.L.D.]] and it is also seen in more than twenty-five countries,<ref name="Summer Wine Story">{{cite web | title=The Summer Wine Story | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/story.htm| work =Summer Wine Online| publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-07 | language = }}</ref> including various [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations in the United States and in Canada on [[VisionTV]].

''Last of the Summer Wine'' was set and filmed in and around [[Holmfirth]], [[West Yorkshire]], England and centred around a trio of old men whose line-up changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as the scruffy and child-like Compo, [[Peter Sallis]] as deep-thinking, meek Norman Clegg and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as authoritarian and snobbish Blamire. When Bates dropped out through illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky [[veteran|war veteran]], Foggy ([[Brian Wilde]]), the eccentric [[inventor]], Seymour ([[Michael Aldridge]]), and former police officer Truly ([[Frank Thornton]]). The men never seem to grow up and develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their youthful stunts. The cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters, each contributing their own subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio. 

After the death of Owen in 1999, Compo was replaced at various times by his real-life son, [[Tom Owen (actor)|Tom Owen]], as equally unkempt Tom, [[Keith Clifford]] as Billy Hardcastle, a man who fancied himself a descendant of [[Robin Hood]], and [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] as the childish Alvin. Due to the age of the main cast, a new trio was formed during the 30th series featuring somewhat younger actors, and this format was used for the final two instalments of the show. This group consisted of [[Russ Abbot]] as a former [[milkman]] who fancied himself a [[Espionage|secret agent]], Hobbo, [[Burt Kwouk]] as the electrical repairman, Entwistle, and Murphy as Alvin. Sallis and Thornton, both past members of the trio, continued in supporting roles alongside the new actors.

Although some feel the show's quality declined over the years,<ref name="Huddersfield Daily Examiner 2003-09-23">{{cite news | first=Ed | last=Reed | title=Axe Summer Wine says shock magazine survey | date=2003-09-23 | url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/travel-news/last-of-summer-wine/2003/09/23/axe-summer-wine-says-shock-magazine-survey-86081-13440231/| work =[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]] | accessdate = 2007-12-04 }}</ref> ''Last of the Summer Wine'' continued to receive large audiences for the BBC<ref name = "Digital Spy 2007-07-17"/> and was praised for its positive portrayal of older people<ref name="The Insider Spring 2007">{{cite news | title=Series Profile: Last of the Summer Wine | pages = 8<U+2013>9 |date=May 2007 | url =http://www.will.uiuc.edu/tv/britcoms/bbcfiles/insider/insidermay07.doc | work =The Insider | publisher = BBC Sales | accessdate = 2007-12-04 | format = DOC}}</ref> and [[Family-friendliness|family-friendly]] humour.<ref name="The Insider Spring 2007" /> Many members of the [[British Royal Family]] enjoyed the show.<ref name = "Huddersfield Daily Examiner 2001-12-15"/> The programme was nominated for numerous awards and won the [[National Television Awards|National Television Award]] for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999.<ref name="NTA winner" /> There were many [[Christmas in the media|holiday specials]], two television films and a documentary film about the series.

==Production==
[[Image:Roy Clarke.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Roy Clarke]] created and wrote every episode of ''Last of the Summer Wine''.]]

===History and development===
In 1972, [[Duncan Wood]], at that time the head of BBC Comedy, watched a drama on television called ''The Misfit''. Impressed by writer [[Roy Clarke]]'s ability to inject comedy into the drama, Wood offered Clarke the opportunity to write a sitcom.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /> Clarke nearly turned the job down as he felt that the BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" />

Clarke chose the original title, ''The Last of the Summer Wine'', to convey the idea that the characters are not in the autumn of their lives but the summer, even though it may be "the last of the summer". BBC producers hated this at first and insisted that it remain a temporary [[working title]], while the cast worried that viewers would forget the name of the show.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /> The working title was changed later to ''The Library Mob'', a reference to one of the trio's regular haunts early in the show. Clarke switched back to his original preference shortly before production began,<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /> a title that was shortened to ''Last of the Summer Wine'' after the pilot show.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;16</ref>

''The Last of the Summer Wine'' premiered as an episode of BBC's ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' on 4 January 1973. The pilot, "Of Funerals and Fish", received enough positive response that a full series was commissioned to be broadcast before the end of the year.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16<U+2013>17">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;16<U+2013>17</ref> Although the initial series did not do well in the ratings, the BBC ordered a second series in 1975.<ref name="Bright and Ross 17<U+2013>19">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;17<U+2013>19</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Holmfirth Sid's Cafe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sid's Caf<U+00E9> in Holmfirth, a regular filming location. The caf<U+00E9> has become a tourist destination on the strength of the series, and features a model of Compo outside for photographic purposes.]]
[[Barry Took]], who had produced a series of ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about [[working men's club]]s, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small [[West Yorkshire]] town of [[Holmfirth]] and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show.<ref name="Bright">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;13<U+2013>14</ref> Took's idea was passed to [[James Gilbert (producer)|James Gilbert]] and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who was at that time filming ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]''. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of ''Last of the Summer Wine''.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /><ref name="Bright"/><ref name="Summer Wine Online">{{cite web |url=http://www.summer-wine.com/story.htm#Why%20was%20it%20Filmed%20in%20Holmfirth?%20Its%20all%20Thanks%20to%20Barry%20Took!|title= The Summer Wine Story: Why was it filmed in Holmfirth?|publisher=Summer Wine Appreciation Society | work = Summer Wine Online|accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref>

Though the exterior shots were always filmed on location in Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed in front of a live studio audience at [[BBC Television Centre]] in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, ''Last of the Summer Wine'' became the first comedy series to do away with the live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth.<ref name="Bright and Ross 117">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;117</ref> The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose laughter was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of [[laugh track|canned laughter]].<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /><ref name="Bright and Ross 117" />

The show used actual businesses and homes in and around Holmfirth, including Sid's Caf<U+00E9> and Nora Batty's house, a real Holmfirth residence owned by Sonia Whitehead.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /> Although this has helped the Holmfirth economy and made it a [[tourist destination]], tensions have occasionally surfaced between Holmfirth residents and the crew. One such incident, regarding compensation to local residents, prompted producer [[Alan J. W. Bell]] to consider not filming in Holmfirth any more. The situation escalated to the point that Bell filmed a scene in which Nora Batty put her house up for sale.<ref name="The Huddersfield Daily Examiner 2005-08-16">{{cite news | first=Neil | last=Atkinson | title=Is it the Last of Summer Wine? | date=2005-08-16 | url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/travel-news/last-of-summer-wine/2005/08/16/is-it-the-last-of-summer-wine-86081-15863732/ | work =The Huddersfield Daily Examiner | accessdate = 2007-12-04 | language = }}</ref>

In May 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that [[Frank Thornton]] and [[Peter Sallis]] would no longer appear in outdoor scenes of future series because of the cost of insuring actors over the age of 80. For the final two series of the show, Thornton and Sallis, both in their late eighties, only filmed scenes indoors while younger actors film the outdoor scenes.<ref name="The Times 2008-05-10">{{cite news | first=Adam | last=Sherwin | title=Last of the Summer Wine antics 'dangerous' for elderly actors | date=2008-05-10 | url =http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3905028.ece| work =The Times | accessdate = 2008-05-30 | language =| location=London}}</ref>

===Crew===
Every episode of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' was written by [[Roy Clarke]]. The ''[[Comedy Playhouse]]'' pilot and all episodes of the first series were produced and directed by James Gilbert. [[Bernard Thompson (director)|Bernard Thompson]] produced and directed the second series of episodes in 1975.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16<U+2013>17" /> In 1976, [[Sydney Lotterby]] took over as producer and director.

W. Bell took over as producer and director. Bell, in an effort to get each scene exactly right, was known for his use of more film and more takes than his predecessors<ref name="30 Years LOTSW"/> and for using wider angles that feature more of the local Holmfirth landscape.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" />

In 1983, Lotterby returned to the show at the insistence of [[Brian Wilde]], who preferred Lotterby's use of tight shots focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell's wide-angle scenes. Lotterby produced and directed one additional series before departing again the same year.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" /> Bell then returned to the show beginning with the 1983 Christmas special and produced and directed all episodes of the show to the end of the 31st series.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24" />

In 2008, Bell announced that he had quit as producer of ''Last of the Summer Wine''. Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, "I have now decided I will not do it again. I have had enough of the BBC<U+2019>s attitude." The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special.<ref name="Bell Quits">{{cite news | first=Neil | last=Atkinson | title=Last of Summer Wine boss quits in axe row | date=2008-12-24 | url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2008/12/24/last-of-summer-wine-boss-quits-in-axe-row-86081-22542521/ | work =The Huddersfield Daily Examiner | accessdate = 2009-01-12 }}</ref> However, on 26 June 2009, the BBC announced that it had recommissioned the show for a 31st series with Bell continuing as producer and director.<ref name="BBC Press Office - 26 June" />

Composer and conductor [[Ronnie Hazlehurst]], who had also produced themes for such series as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Yes Minister]]'', created the theme for the show. The BBC initially disliked Hazlehurst's theme, feeling it was not proper for a comedy programme to have such mellow music. He was asked to play the music faster for more comedic effect but eventually his original slower version was accepted.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" />

The theme, an instrumental work, featured lyrics three times. The 1981 Christmas special, "Whoops", had two verses of lyrics written by Roy Clarke that were performed over the closing credits. The 1983 film, "Getting Sam Home", used those two verses, with an additional two and played them over the opening credits. Another altered version was sung during Compo's funeral in the 2000 episode "Just a Small Funeral". Bill Owen also wrote a different version of the lyrics but this version was never used during an episode of the show.<ref name="SUMMER WINE MUSIC AND LYRICS">{{cite news | title=Summer Wine Music and Lyrics | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/lyrics.htm| work =Summer Wine Online | publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-27 | language = }}</ref>

===Cancellation===
Despite numerous cast and production changes over the years, ''Last of the Summer Wine'' continued to be popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumors circulated as early as the 1980s that the BBC wanted to cancel the show and replace it with a new programme aimed at a younger demographic. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.<ref name="Huddersfield Daily Examiner 11-03-2005">{{cite news | first=Tony | last=Pogson | title=Summer Wine still gladdens the heart | date=2005-03-11 | url =http://www.examiner.co.uk/travel-news/last-of-summer-wine/2005/03/11/summer-wine-still-gladdens-the-heart-86081-15284680/ | work =The Huddersfield Daily Examiner | accessdate = 2007-12-04 | language = }}</ref>
 
In December 2008, Alan J. W. Bell stated in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the BBC had not yet commissioned a new series and that bosses at the network told him one would not be produced. Bell criticised this decision, stating that "millions still enjoy the series and the actors love being involved" and that it would be a terrible blow to the shops and businesses in Holmfirth who have come to depend on tourist revenue. The BBC denied these claims, saying that a decision had not yet been reached whether to commission another series or not.<ref name="Daily Telegraph 10-12-08"/> 

It was confirmed on 26 June 2009 that a 31st series of 6 episodes had been commissioned for transmission in 2010.<ref name="BBC Press Office - 26 June">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/26/wine.shtml|title= BBC - Press Office - Last Of The Summer Wine recommissioned for BBC One|accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> However, on 2 June 2010, the BBC announced that it would not renew ''Last of the Summer Wine'' after its thirty-first series aired during the summer of 2010.<ref name="Independent 2010-06-02" /> The final episode of the show, "How Not to Cry at Weddings", subsequently aired on 29 August 2010.<ref name="How Not to Cry at Weddings" />

==Characters and casting==
{{Main|List of Last of the Summer Wine characters}}
[[Image:Lotsw.jpg|thumbnail|left|The most famous of the ''Last of the Summer Wine'' trios: From left to right: [[Peter Sallis]] as Norman Clegg, [[Brian Wilde]] as "Foggy" Dewhurst and [[Bill Owen (actor)|Bill Owen]] as "Compo" Simmonite.]]
Initially, the only certain cast member for the show was [[Peter Sallis]]. Clarke had already collaborated on a few scripts with him and the character of Norman Clegg was created especially for Sallis, who liked the character and agreed to play him.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;14</ref> He was soon joined by an actor he had previously worked with, comedy actor [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Cyril Blamire.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;15</ref>

{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=right |quote="The joy of Bill Owen's Compo is not what he does with the words but where he takes the character beyond what's in the script. He did this in a physical manner. It was only when I saw Bill on screen that I realized what a wonderful physical clown he was."|source=[[Roy Clarke]] on Bill Owen and Compo<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;40</ref>}}
[[James Gilbert (producer)|James Gilbert]] had seen film actor Bill Owen playing northern characters in the [[Royal Court Theatre]] and proposed to cast him as Compo Simmonite. Clarke, who initially saw Owen as an archetypal [[cockney]] who could not play as solid a northern character as Compo was meant to be, only recognised Owen's potential after going to London for a [[read-through]] with him.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16<U+2013>17" />

On-screen chemistry with existing players determined the later changes to the cast. [[Brian Wilde]], [[Michael Aldridge]] and [[Frank Thornton]] each brought a sense of completion to the trio after the departure of the preceding third man.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;61<U+2013>67</ref> [[Tom Owen (actor)|Tom Owen]] provided a direct link between his father and himself after the death of Bill Owen.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" /><ref name="Bright and Ross 36">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;36</ref> [[Keith Clifford]] was added following three popular guest appearances on the show.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;139<U+2013>140</ref> [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] was chosen as Nora Batty's neighbour because of his work on ''[[George and Mildred]]'', where he played the [[wikt:henpecked|hen-pecked]] husband to a strong-willed woman.<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" />

In 2008, the BBC announced that [[Russ Abbot]] would join the cast as a relatively more youthful actor in series 30. Abbot was cast to allow Sallis and Thornton to reduce their role on the show to only indoor scenes.<ref name="The Times 2008-05-10" /> Abbot portrayed Luther "Hobbo" Hobdyke, who formed a new trio with Entwistle and Alvin.<ref name="I Was A Hitman for Primrose Dairies ep">{{cite episode|title=I Was A Hitman for Primrose Dairies|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

The original cast of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' also included a handful of characters with whom the trio regularly interacted. [[Kathy Staff]] was chosen to play Compo's neighbour, Nora Batty. Gilbert was initially sceptical about casting Staff but changed his mind after she padded herself to look bigger and read from a scene between her character and Owen's.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;74<U+2013>75</ref> This group was rounded out by characters at two locations frequented by the trio: [[John Comer]] and [[Jane Freeman (actress)|Jane Freeman]] as Sid<ref>Bright and Ross (2000) p.&nbsp;94</ref> and Ivy,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;77</ref> the quarrelling husband-and-wife owners of the local caf<U+00E9>; and [[Blake Butler]] and [[Rosemary Martin]] as Mr. Wainwright<ref name="Bright and Ross 102">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;102</ref> and Mrs. Partridge,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;89</ref> the librarians having a not-so-secret affair.

Supporting cast members were added throughout the run of the show. The only addition with no professional acting experience was the Holmfirth resident Gordon Wharmby, who performed so well during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan J. W. Bell cast him in one episode. Pegden became a regular character after a positive audience reception.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;99<U+2013>101</ref>

When Alan J. W. Bell took over as producer, the plots of ''Last of the Summer Wine'' moved away from the original dialogue-packed scenes in the pub and the library; guest actors were brought in to interact with the trio in new situations. Although many of these guest appearances would last for only one episode,<ref name="Bright and Ross 30">Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;30</ref><ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;145</ref> some led to a permanent role on the show, as in the cases of Gordon Wharmby,<ref name="Car and Garter ep">{{cite episode|title=Car and Garter|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

==Scenario==
''Last of the Summer Wine'' focused on a trio of older men and their youthful antics. The original trio consisted of Compo Simmonite, Norman Clegg and Cyril Blamire. Blamire left in 1976, when Michael Bates fell ill shortly before filming of the third series, requiring Clarke to hastily rewrite the series with a new third man. The third member of the trio would be recast four times over the next three decades: Foggy Dewhurst in 1976,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;19</ref> Seymour Utterthwaite in 1986,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;26</ref> Foggy again in 1990,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;29</ref> and Truly Truelove in 1997.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;31<U+2013>32</ref> After Compo died in 2000, Compo's son, Tom Simmonite, filled the gap for the rest of that series,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000) p.&nbsp;36</ref> and Billy Hardcastle joined the cast as the third lead character in 2001.<ref name="Getting Barry's Goat ep">{{cite episode|title=Getting Barry's Goat|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J. W. Bell (director)|network=BBC One|airdate=2001-04-01|seriesno=22|number=1}}</ref> The trio became a quartet between 2003 and 2006 when Alvin Smedley moved in next-door to Nora Batty,<ref name="The Lair of the Cat Creature ep">{{cite episode|title=The Lair of the Cat Creature|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

The trio explored the world around them, experiencing a second childhood with no wives, jobs or responsibilities. They passed the time by speculating about their fellow townspeople and testing inventions.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>13</ref> Regular subplots in the first decade of the show included: Sid and Ivy bickering over the management of the caf<U+00E9>,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;94<U+2013>96</ref> Mr Wainwright and Mrs Partridge having a secret love affair that everyone knows about,<ref name="Bright and Ross 102" /> Wally trying to get away from Nora's watchful eye,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;96<U+2013>99</ref> Foggy's exaggerated war stories,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;58<U+2013>65</ref> and Compo's schemes to win the affections of Nora Batty.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp&nbsp;76<U+2013>77</ref>

The number of subplots on the show grew as more cast members were added. Regular subplots since the 1980s included: Howard and Marina trying to have an affair without Howard's wife finding out (a variation of the Wainwright-Partridge subplot of the 1970s),<ref name="Bright and Ross 102" /> the older women meeting for tea and discussing their theories about men and life,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;81<U+2013>83</ref> Auntie Wainwright trying to sell unwanted merchandise to unsuspecting customers,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;85<U+2013>87</ref> Smiler trying to find a woman,<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;110<U+2013>111</ref> Barry trying to better himself (at the insistence of Glenda),<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;104<U+2013>108</ref> and Tom trying to stay one step ahead of the [[Repossession|repo man]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Miraculous Curing of Old Goff Helliwell|series=Last of the Summer Wine|credits=Roy Clarke (writer) & Alan J.

''Last of the Summer Wine'' is the [[List of longest running U.K. television series|longest-running comedy programme in Britain]], and the longest running situation comedy in the world. Each series has between six and twelve episodes; most were thirty minutes in length, with some specials running longer. There were 295 entries and 31 series between 1973 and 2010, counting the pilot, all episodes of the series, specials, and two films.

===Specials===
In 1978, the BBC commissioned a ''Last of the Summer Wine'' [[Christmas in the media|Christmas special]] instead of a new series. Titled "Small Tune on a Penny Wassail", it was broadcast on 26 December 1978. Other Christmas programmes followed in 1979 and 1981. The 1981 special, "Whoops", gained 17&nbsp;million viewers and was beaten only by ''[[Coronation Street]]'' for the number one spot. Christmas shows were produced infrequently thereafter and sometimes were the only new episodes in years without an order for a new series.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;20<U+2013>22</ref> This happened often during the 1980s when Roy Clarke's commitment to ''[[Open All Hours]]'' prevented the production of a full series every year.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;23<U+2013>24</ref> The specials often included well-known guest stars such as John Cleese<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;139</ref> and June Whitfield.<ref name="Potts in Pole Position ep" />

The first New Year special, "The Man who Nearly Knew Pavarotti", was commissioned in 1994. The hour-long show was broadcast on 1 January 1995 and featured [[Norman Wisdom]] as a piano player who had lost the confidence to play.<ref name="Bright and Ross 30" /> A second New Year programme was produced and broadcast in 2000 to celebrate the [[millennium|new millennium]]. It featured the second guest appearance by [[Keith Clifford]] and a guest appearance by [[Dora Bryan]]. Titled "Last Post and Pigeon", the show ran for sixty minutes and dealt with the trio's [[pilgrimage]] to visit World War II graves in France. Part of this special was shot on location in France.<ref name="Bright and Ross 35<U+2013>36">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;35<U+2013>36</ref> A third New Year show, titled "I Was a Hitman for Primrose Dairies", aired on 31 December 2008<ref name="Daily Telegraph 10-12-08">{{cite news | first=Sarah | last=Knapton| title=Last of The Summer Wine to be cancelled after 35 years, producer claims | date=2008-12-10 | url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3815671/Last-of-The-Summer-Wine-to-be-cancelled-after-35-years-producer-claims.html | work =The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = 2008-12-22 | language = }}</ref> and introduced Hobbo and the new trio he formed with Entwistle and Alvin.<ref name="I Was A Hitman for Primrose Dairies ep" />

===Films===
In 1983, Bill Owen suggested to returning producer Alan J. W. Bell that Roy Clarke's novelisation of the show (see [[#Other media|below]]) should be made into a feature length special. Other [[British sitcom]]s such as ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' and ''[[Dad's Army]]'' had previously produced films made for the cinema, but the BBC were initially sceptical as they had never before commissioned a film based on a comedy programme for original broadcast on television. They nevertheless commissioned a ninety minute film named "Getting Sam Home", which was broadcast on 27 December 1983, and started a trend which would continue with other British sitcoms, including ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24"/>

After the success of "Getting Sam Home", a second film was made in 1986. Titled "Uncle of the Bride", the film featured the introduction of Michael Aldridge as Seymour, the new third man of the trio. The plot centred around the marriage of Seymour's niece, Glenda ([[Sarah Thomas (actress)|Sarah Thomas]]), to Barry ([[Mike Grady (actor)|Mike Grady]]). Also making her first appearance in the film was [[Thora Hird]] as Seymour's sister and Glenda's mother, Edie, as well as re-introducing Gordon Wharmby as Edie's husband Wesley, previously seen in a popular one-off appearance. The second film proved a success and all four new characters (five including Wesley) were carried over to the show beginning with the ninth series in 1986.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;30<U+2013>31</ref>

===Documentaries===
A documentary film was commissioned to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ''Last of the Summer Wine''. Produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell, it featured interviews with the majority of cast and crew members, outtakes from the show, and a behind-the-scenes look at production. Segments with [[Duncan Wood]] and [[Barry Took]] explained the origins of the show and how it came to be filmed in Holmfirth. The documentary was broadcast on 30 March 1997.<ref name="Bright and Ross 16<U+2013>17" />

An updated version of the documentary was commissioned for the 30th anniversary of the series. Broadcast on 13 April 2003, this version featured an expanded interview with [[Brian Wilde]] and new interviews with [[Brian Murphy (actor)|Brian Murphy]] and [[Burt Kwouk]].<ref name="30 Years LOTSW" />

===DVD releases===
In September 2002, Universal Playback (licensed by the BBC) began releasing boxed sets of episodes on DVD for [[DVD region code|region two]]. Each set contains two consecutive full series of episodes.<ref>{{cite news | first=June | last=Toy | title=Summer Wine DVD - Fan's Review | publisher= Summer Wine Appreciation Society | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/bbc/dvd.htm | work =Summer Wine Online | accessdate = 2008-05-22 }}</ref> Three "best of" collections as well as four sets devoted to individual series have been released for [[DVD region code|region one]].

==Other adaptations==
===Spin-off===
{{Main|First of the Summer Wine}}

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] show, ''First of the Summer Wine'', premiered on BBC One in 1988. The new programme was written by [[Roy Clarke]] and used different actors to follow the activities of the principal characters from ''Last of the Summer Wine'' in the months leading up to World War II. Unlike its mother show, ''First of the Summer Wine'' was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere.<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE">{{cite news | title=First of the Summer Wine - Special Article | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/index.htm | work =Summer Wine Online| publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | language = }}</ref> New supporting characters were added to those from ''Last of the Summer Wine''. [[Peter Sallis]] and [[Jonathan Linsley]] were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.<ref name="Bright and Ross 160" />

The spin-off show could not build on its early success<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /> and was cancelled after two series of thirteen episodes in 1989.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;28<U+2013>29</ref> Although the BBC has never rerun the show, it has been broadcast on [[G.O.L.D.]]<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - SPECIAL ARTICLE" /> and internationally.<ref name="FIRST OF THE SUMMER WINE - UNCOVERED!">{{cite news |title=First of the Summer Wine - Uncovered! | url =http://www.summer-wine.com/fosw/ozfan.htm | work =Summer Wine Online| publisher = Summer Wine Appreciation Society | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | language = }}</ref>

===Stage adaptations===
A live production of ''Last of the Summer Wine'', known informally as the "summer season", was produced in [[Bournemouth]] in 1984. While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg, Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24<U+2013>25" /> The show focused on the men's interaction with Clegg's new neighbour, Howard ([[Kenneth Waller]]), and his wife, Pearl, played by a local actress. The first act built up to the appearance of Marina ([[Jean Fergusson]]), who was in correspondence with Howard. At the end of the first act, Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot.<ref name="Bright and Ross 25<U+2013>26">Bright and Ross (2000), pp.&nbsp;25<U+2013>26</ref> Howard and Marina's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television show. In the first series, the librarian, Mr. Wainwright, was having a love affair with his married assistant, Mrs. Partridge. Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret, especially from Mrs. Partridge's husband, the trio of old men were well aware of the affair.<ref name="Bright and Ross 102" /> The summer season reversed the roles: Howard became the married partner, and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife.<ref name="Bright and Ross 24<U+2013>25" />

The summer season proved to be a success and frequently played to packed houses. In 1985, the show was once again produced, first as a two-week tour of Britain, and then as another summer season in Bournemouth. Fergusson returned for the second summer season, once again playing Marina. [[Robert Fyfe]] replaced Waller in the role of Howard, and [[Juliette Kaplan]] took the role of Pearl for this season. Although the new characters were not originally intended to be carried over to the television programme, Roy Clarke included them in four of the following six episodes of the 1985 series. All three characters remained until the end of the sitcom.<ref name="Bright and Ross 25<U+2013>26" />

An amended version of the show toured across Britain in 1987. Sallis was reluctant to appear in the new production, and his role in the show was rewritten and played by [[Derek Fowlds]]. Because Owen was the only member of the television show's trio to appear in the production, it was retitled ''Compo Plays Cupid''. Once again, the summer season was a success.<ref>Bright and Ross (2000), p.&nbsp;27</ref>

A new stage adaptation of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel ''The Moonbather'', the play was first performed by the [[Scunthorpe]] Little Theatre Club from 7 October to 11 October 2003.<ref name="Moonbather play">{{cite web |url=http://www.littletheatreclub.com/code/moonbather2003.htm|title= Moonbather 2003 |publisher=Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club |accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref> Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as they attempted to get to the bottom of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in [[Eastbourne]] by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.<ref name="Eastbourne Theatres">{{cite web |url=http://www.eastbournetheatres.co.uk/What's_On/show.asp?showID=1704|title= Last of the Summer Wine <U+2013> The Moonbather |publisher=Eastbourne Theatres |accessdate=2010-04-14}}</ref>

In 2010, it was announced that long-time supporting cast members [[Ken Kitson]] and [[Louis Emerick]] would spin their characters off into their own stage adaptation, titled ''An Arresting Night''. Kitson and Emerick, who appeared together on ''Last of the Summer Wine'' as [[constable|Police Constables]] Cooper and Walsh from 2003 to 2010, reprised their roles in an [[Improvisational theatre|improvised stage play]]. While some elements of the series will be used, the majority of the play was improvised, with Kitson and Emerick each deriving their cues of what to do from the audience.

A 2003 survey by ''[[Radio Times]]'' found that ''Last of the Summer Wine'' was the programme readers most wanted to see cancelled.
