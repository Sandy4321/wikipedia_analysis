'''Bristol''' ({{IPAEng|<U+02C8>br<U+026A>st<U+0259>l}}) is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], [[unitary authority]] and [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] in [[South West England|South West]] [[England]], <span style="white-space:nowrap">105&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(169&nbsp;km)</span> west of [[London]].

With an approximate population of 410,800, and [[urban area]] of 550,200, it is England's sixth, and the [[United Kingdom]]'s ninth most populous city, one of England's [[English Core Cities Group|core cities]] and the most populous city in South West England. It received a royal charter in 1155 and was granted county status in 1373. For half a millennium it was the second or third largest English city, until the rapid rise of [[Liverpool]] and [[Birmingham]] in the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the later part of the [[18th century]]. It borders on the [[Unitary authority|unitary districts]] of [[Bath and North East Somerset]] (BANES), [[North Somerset]] and [[South Gloucestershire]], between the cities of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Newport]], and has a short coastline on the estuary of the [[River Severn]], which flows into the [[Bristol Channel]].

Bristol is one of the centres of culture, employment and education in the region.  From its earliest days, its prosperity has been linked to that of the [[Port of Bristol]], the commercial [[port]], which was in the city centre but has now moved to the Bristol Channel coast at [[Avonmouth]] and [[Portbury]]. In more recent years the economy has been built on the [[aerospace]] industry, and the city centre docks have been regenerated as a centre of heritage and culture.  

==Boundaries==
There are a number of different ways in which Bristol's boundaries are defined, depending on whether the boundaries attempt to define the city, the built-up area, or the wider "[[Greater Bristol]]". The narrowest definition of the city is the [[Bristol City Council|city council]] boundary; although this definition does include a large portion of the [[Severn Estuary]], west as far as the islands of [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].<ref>[https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1312817302&type=-1&title=Bristol%3b+City+of+UA+(local+authorities%3a+district+%2f+unitary) NOMIS (www.nomisweb.co.uk) area boundary for the Bristol unitary authority]</ref> A slightly less narrow definition is used by the [[Office for National Statistics]]; this includes built-up areas which adjoin Bristol but are not within the city council boundary, such as [[Whitchurch, Bristol|Whitchurch]] village, [[Filton]], [[Patchway]], [[Bradley Stoke]], and excludes non-built-up areas within the city council boundary.<ref>[https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/keystats/sqmap.aspx?kv=1371537983&type=-1&title=Bristol+Urban+Area+-+Bristol+(urban+area+subdivisions) NOMIS (www.nomisweb.co.uk) area boundary for the Bristol urban area] (definition used by the Office for National Statistics)</ref>   The ONS has also defined an area which it calls the "Bristol Urban Area" which includes [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Mangotsfield]], [[Stoke Gifford]], [[Winterbourne, Gloucestershire|Winterbourne]], [[Frampton Cotterell]], [[Almondsbury]] and [[Easton-in-Gordano]]. <ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&Pos=2&ColRank=1&Rank=224 KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas] (a page at the Office for National Statistics website, accessed on 16 July 2007)</ref> The term "Greater Bristol" (used for example by the Government Office of the South West <ref>Atkins, 2005. "[http://www.gbsts.com/ Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study]."</ref> is most usually used to refer to the area covered by the city and its three neighbouring local authorities.

==History==
{{main|History of Bristol}}
There is evidence of settlement in the Bristol area from the [[palaeolithic]] era, with 60,000-year-old archaeological finds at [[Shirehampton]] and [[St Annes, Bristol|St Annes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Local-History-Heritage/archaeology/palaeolithic-in-bristol.en |title=The Palaeolithic in Bristol | publisher=Bristol City Council | date= [[24 April]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-05-06 }},</ref> 
There are [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]s near the city, at [[Leigh Woods]] and [[Clifton Down]] on the side of the [[Avon Gorge]], and on [[Kingsweston Hill]], near [[Henbury]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Local-History-Heritage/archaeology/bristol-in-the-iron-age.en |title=Bristol in the Iron Age |accessdate=2007-03-10 |publisher=Bristol City Council }}</ref>. 
During the [[Roman Britain|Roman era]] there was a settlement, ''Abona'', at what is now [[Sea Mills, Bristol|Sea Mills]], connected to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] by [[Roman road]], and another settlement at what is now [[Inns Court]]. There were also isolated Roman villas and small Roman settlements throughout the area.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Bristol City Council | url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Local-History-Heritage/archaeology/bristol-in-the-roman-period.en | title=Bristol in the Roman Period |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>

The town of ''Brycgstow'' ([[Old English language|Old English]], "the place at the bridge"<ref>{{cite book |last=Little |first=Bryan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The City and County of Bristol |year=1967 |publisher=S. R. Publishers |location=Wakefield |isbn=0854095128 }}</ref>)
was in existence by the beginning of the [[11th century]], and under [[Normans|Norman]] rule acquired one of the strongest [[Bristol Castle|castles]] in southern England.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Bristol Past | url=http://www.building-history.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Bristol/castle.htm | title=The Impregnable City |accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> 
The [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] in the [[Bristol city centre|city centre]] has evolved into [[Bristol Harbour]], and since the [[12th century]] the harbour has been an important port, handling much of England's trade with [[Ireland]]. In 1247 a new bridge was built, which was replaced by the current [[Bristol Bridge]] in the 1760s,<ref>{{cite web | title=Bristol Bridge | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=378988 | accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> 
and the town was extended to incorporate neighbouring suburbs, becoming in 1373 a [[county corporate|county]] in its own right.<ref name=rayfield>{{cite book |last=Rayfield |first=Jack |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Somerset & Avon |year=1985 |publisher=Cadogan |location=London |isbn=0947754091 }}</ref> During this period Bristol also became a centre of shipbuilding and manufacturing. Bristol was the starting point for many important voyages, notably [[John Cabot]]'s 1497 voyage of exploration to North America.
[[Image:bristol.cathedral.west.front.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The west front of Bristol Cathedral]]
By the [[14th century]] Bristol was England's third-largest town (after London and [[York]]), with perhaps 15&ndash;20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the [[Black Death]] of 1348&ndash;49.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/LocalHistory/LocalHistoryTable1.htm |title=Largest towns in England in 1334 |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=Love my town }},</ref> 
The Plague inflicted a prolonged pause in the growth of Bristol's population, with numbers remaining at 10&ndash;12,000 through most of the [[15th century|15th]] and [[16th century|16th centuries]]. The [[Diocese of Bristol]] was founded in 1542,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weldgen.tripod.com/bristol-history/ |title=Pictorial Record of Bristol's History |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=History of Bristol Companies }}</ref> 
with the former [[Abbey]] of St Augustine becoming [[Bristol Cathedral]]. Traditionally this is equivalent to the town being granted [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]]. During the [[English Civil War|1640s Civil War]] the city was occupied by Royalist military, after they overran [[Royal Fort]] the last Parliamentarian stronghold in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title= Bristol | work=Fortified Places | url=http://www.fortified-places.com/bristol.html | accessdate=2007-03-24}}</ref>
[[Image:bristol.harbour.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bristol Bridge]] seen across the Harbour]]

Renewed growth came with the [[17th century]] rise of England's American colonies and the rapid [[18th century]] expansion of England's part in the [[Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic trade]] in Africans taken for [[slavery]] in the [[Americas]].  Bristol, along with [[Liverpool]], became a centre for the slave trade although few slaves were brought to Britain. During the height of the slave trade, from 1700 to 1807, more than 2,000 slaving ships were fitted out at Bristol, carrying a (conservatively) estimated half a million people from [[Africa]] to the Americas and slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/pdf/pressoffice/press_release_13_12_05.pdf |title=Lottery Fund rejects Bristol application in support of a major exhibition to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format=PDF |work=British Empire & Commonwealth Museum }},</ref>  
Still standing in Bristol is the Seven Stars pub, where [[abolitionist]] [[Thomas Clarkson]] collected information regarding the slave trade.
[[Image:Bristol 1873.png|400px|thumb|An 1873 engraving showing sights in and around Bristol]]
Fishermen who left Bristol were long part of the migratory fishery to the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and began settling that island permanently in larger numbers around this time. Bristol's strong nautical ties meant that maritime safety was an important issue in the city, In the 19th century [[Samuel Plimsoll]], "the sailor's friend", campaigned to make the seas safer. He was shocked by the overloaded cargoes and successfully fought for a compulsory [[Waterline|load line]] on ships.

Competition from Liverpool from c. 1760, the disruption of maritime commerce through war with [[France]] (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the North and Midlands. The passage up the heavily tidal Avon Gorge, which had made the port highly secure during the Middle Ages, had become a liability which the construction of a new "[[Floating Harbour]]" (designed by [[William Jessop]]) in 1804&ndash;9 failed to overcome. Nevertheless, Bristol's population (66,000 in 1801) quintupled during the 19th century, supported by new industries and growing commerce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/GBH_match_page.jsp?ons=Bristol |title=A vision of Bristol UA/City |accessdate=2007-01-29 |work=A Vision of Britain}}</ref> 
It was particularly associated with the Victorian engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who designed the [[Great Western Railway]] between Bristol and London, two pioneering Bristol-built steamships, the [[SS Great Britain]] and [[SS Great Western]], and the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]].  [[John Wesley]] founded the very first [[Methodist]] Chapel, called the [[New Room, Bristol|New Room]], in Bristol in 1739. [[Bristol Riots|Riots]] occurred in 1793 and 1831, the first beginning as a protest at renewal of an act levying tolls on Bristol Bridge, and the latter after the rejection of the second [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]].

Bristol's city centre suffered severe damage from bombing during the [[Bristol Blitz]] of [[World War II]]. The original central shopping area, near the bridge and castle, is now a park containing two bombed out churches and some tiny fragments of the castle. A third bombed church nearby, [[St Nicholas, Bristol|St Nicholas]], has been restored and has been made into a museum which houses a [[triptych]] by [[William Hogarth]], painted for the high altar of [[St Mary Redcliffe]] in 1756. The museum also contains statues moved from [[Arno's Court Triumphal Arch]], of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] and [[King Edward III]] taken from Lawfords' Gate of the city walls when they were demolished around 1760 and 13th century figures from Bristol's Newgate representing Robert, the builder of [[Bristol Castle]], and [[Geoffrey de Montbray|Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances]], builder of the fortified walls of the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Four figures on Arno's Gateway | work=Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project | url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BL/BR137.htm | accessdate=2007-03-19}}</ref>

The rebuilding of [[Bristol city centre]] was characterised by large, cheap [[tower block]]s, [[brutalist architecture]] and expansion of roads.  Since the 1980s another trend has emerged with the closure of some main roads, the restoration of the Georgian period [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]] and [[Portland Square, Bristol|Portland Square]], the demolition and rebuilding of the Broadmead shopping centre (at 2007 in progress) and the demolition of the city centre's tallest post-war blocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4608986.stm |title=Demolition of city tower begins |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=BBC News | date= [[13 January]] [[2006]]}}</ref>
 
The removal of the docks to [[Avonmouth]], <span style="white-space:nowrap">7&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(11&nbsp;km)</span> downstream from the city centre has also allowed redevelopment of the old central dock area (the "[[Floating Harbour]]") in recent decades, although at one time the continued existence of the docks was in jeopardy as it was viewed as a derelict industrial site rather than an asset. However the holding, in 1996,  of the first [[International Festival of the Sea, 1996|International Festival of the Sea]] in and around the docks, affirmed the dockside area in its new leisure role as a key feature of the city.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Jeremy McNeill |coauthors=Ben Wookey |title=Bristol's Harbourside: A Guide to the City Docks |year=1997 |publisher=Hotwell Press |location=Bristol |isbn=0-9530270-0-7 }}</ref>

As well as Bristol's nautical connections, the city's economy is reliant on the [[aerospace]] industry, the media, information technology and financial services sectors and tourism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Business/economic-sectors-bristol.en |title=Bristol Economy Key Sectors |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=Bristol City Council }}.</ref> In 2004 Bristol's [[GDP]] was <U+00A3>9.439 billion [[Pound Sterling|GBP]], and the combined GDP of Gloucestershire, Wiltshire and North Somerset was <U+00A3>44.098 billion.  The GDP per head was <U+00A3>23,962 (US$47,738, <U+20AC>35,124) making the city more affluent than the UK as a whole, at 40% above the national average. This makes it the third-highest per-capita GDP of any English city, after [[London]] and [[Nottingham]], and the fifth highest GDP per capita of any city in the United Kingdom, behind [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Belfast]] and [[Nottingham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/regional_snapshot_2006/SubregionalGVA.xls |title= Sub-regional: Gross value added1 (GVA) at current basic price}}.</ref> In December 2005, Bristol's [[unemployment]] rate was 5.2%, compared to 3.6% for the south west and 4.8% for the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/download/asset/?asset_id=5676034 |title= Bristol labour market |accessdate=2007-03-10 |author=Nomis |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=2005 |month= |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Bristol City Council |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}.</ref>

While Bristol's economy is no longer reliant upon its port, the city is the largest importer of cars to the UK. Since the port was leased in 1991, <U+00A3>330 million has been invested and the annual tonnage throughput has increased from 4 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.business-matters.biz/default.asp?p=6 |title=Key Facts & Figures |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=BANES Economic Development Unit }}.</ref> The financial services sector employs 40,000 in the city, and the hi-tech sector is important, with 400 micro-electronics and silicon design companies, as well as the [[Hewlett-Packard]] national research laboratories. Bristol is the UK's seventh most popular destination for foreign tourists, and the city receives nine million visitors each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Leisure-Culture/Tourism-Travel/bristol-today-an-overview-of-the-city.en |title=Bristol Today - an overview of the city |accessdate=2007-03-10 |format= |work=Bristol City Council }}.</ref>

In the 20th century, Bristol's manufacturing activities expanded to include aircraft production at [[Filton]], by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]], and aero-engine manufacture by [[Bristol Aero Engines]] (later [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]]) at [[Patchway]]. The aeroplane company became famous for the [[World War I]] [[Bristol F.2 Fighter|Bristol Fighter]], and [[World War II|Second World War]] [[Blenheim]] and [[Beaufighter]] aircraft. In the 1950s it became one of the country's major manufacturers of civil aircraft, with the [[Bristol Freighter]] and [[Bristol Britannia|Britannia]] and the huge [[Bristol Brabazon|Brabazon]] airliner. The [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] diversified into car manufacturing in the 1940s, producing hand-built [[luxury car]]s at their factory in [[Filton]], under the name [[Bristol Cars]], which became independent from the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1960.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.boc.net/history.html | work= Bristol Owners Club | title= A brief history of the Bristol Marque | accessdate= 2007-08-29}} </ref>

In the 1960s Filton played a key role in the Anglo-French ''[[Concorde]]'' supersonic airliner project. Concorde components were manufactured in British and French factories and shipped to the two final assembly plants, in [[Toulouse]] and Filton.  The French manufactured the centre fuselage and centre wing and the British the nose, rear fuselage, fin and wingtips, while the [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Olympus 593]] engine's manufacture was split between [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] (Filton) and [[SNECMA]] ([[Paris]]). The British Concorde prototype made its maiden flight from Filton to [[RAF Fairford]] on [[9 April]] [[1969]], five weeks after the French test flight. In 2003 [[British Airways]] and [[Air France]] decided to cease flying the aircraft and to retire them to locations (mostly museums) around the world. On [[26 November]] [[2003]] Concorde 216 made the final Concorde flight, returning to Filton airfield to be kept there permanently as the centrepiece of a projected air museum. This museum will include the existing Bristol Aero Collection, which includes a [[Bristol Britannia]] aircraft.

The aerospace industry remains a major segment of the local economy{{Fact|date=March 2007}}.  The major aerospace companies in Bristol now are [[BAE Systems]], [[Airbus]] and Rolls-Royce, all based at Filton, and aerospace engineering is a prominent research area at nearby UWE.  Another important [[aviation]] company in the city is [[Cameron Balloons]], the a manufacturer of [[hot air balloon]]s. Each August the city is host to the [[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]], one of Europe's largest hot air balloon events.

[[Image:Bristol Old Vic (750px).jpg|thumb|left|The Coopers Hall, entrance to the Bristol Old Vic Theatre Royal complex]]
The city is famous for its music and film industries, and was a finalist for the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2002/dcms194_2002.htm |title=Six Cities Make Short List For European Capital Of Culture 2008 | publisher= Department for Culture, Media and Sport | date= October 2002 |accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>

The city's principal theatre company, the [[Bristol Old Vic]], was founded in 1946 as an offshoot of the [[Old Vic]] company in London. Its premises on [[King Street, Bristol|King Street]] consist of the 1766 Theatre Royal (400 seats), a modern studio theatre called the New Vic (150 seats), and foyer and bar areas in the adjacent [[Coopers' Hall]] (built 1743). The Theatre Royal is a grade I [[listed building]] and the oldest continuously-operating theatre in England. The [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]], which had originated in King street is now a separate company. The [[Bristol Hippodrome]] is a larger theatre (1981 seats) which hosts national touring productions, while the 2000-seat [[Colston Hall]], named after [[Edward Colston]], is the city's main concert venue. Other theatres include the [[Tobacco Factory]], [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital|QEH]] and Redgrave Theatre (at [[Clifton College]]). Bristol is home to many live music venues, including Fiddlers, [[The Victoria Rooms|Victoria Rooms]], St George's and a range of pubs from the jazz orientated [[The Old Duke]] to rock at the Fleece and Firkin and indie bands at the Louisiana.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bristol Music | work=Jezza's Guide | url=http://www.hotwells.freeserve.co.uk/brismusic.html | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

Since the late 1970s, the city has been home to a crop of bands combining punk, funk, dub and political consciousness, the most celebrated being [[The Pop Group]]. Ten years later, Bristol was the birthplace of a type of English [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] music called [[trip hop]] or the "Bristol Sound", from artists such as [[Tricky]], [[Portishead]], [[Smith & Mighty]] and [[Massive Attack]]. It is also a stronghold of [[drum & bass]] with notable artists such as the [[Mercury Prize]] winning [[Roni Size]]/[[Reprazent]] as well as the pioneering [[DJ Krust]] and [[More Rockers]]. This music is part of the wider Bristol urban culture scene which received international media attention in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Blagging and Boasting | work=Metroactive Music | url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/06.18.98/bristol-9824.html | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

[[Image:Bristol pw from ms.jpg|thumb|[[Bristol Industrial Museum]].]]
The [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]] houses a collection of [[natural history]], [[archaeology]], local glassware, Chinese ceramics and art. The [[Bristol Harbour Railway and Industrial Museum|Bristol Industrial Museum]], featuring preserved dock machinery, closed in October 2006 for complete renovation and plans to reopen in 2009 as the Museum of Bristol.<!-- Remove reference with broken link <ref>{{cite web | title=The <U+00A3>10 million industrial revolution | work=This is Bristol | url=http://www.thisisbristol.com/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144913&command=displayContent&sourceNode=200267&home=yes&more_nodeId1=144916&contentPK=15004277 | accessdate=2006-08-19}}</ref>  --> 
The City Museum also runs three preserved historic houses: the [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Tudor Red Lodge]], the [[Georgian House, Bristol|Georgian House]], and [[Blaise Castle]] House. The [[Watershed Media Centre]] and [[Arnolfini gallery]], both in disused dockside warehouses, exhibit contemporary art, photography and cinema, while the city's oldest gallery is at the [[Royal West of England Academy]] in Clifton.

Stop frame animation films and commercials produced by [[Aardman Animations]] and television series focusing on the natural world have also brought fame and artistic credit to the city.  The city is home to the regional headquarters of [[BBC West]], and the [[BBC Natural History Unit]]. Locations in and around Bristol often feature in the BBC's natural history programmes, including the children's television programme ''[[Animal Magic]]'', filmed at [[Bristol Zoo]].
[[Image:llandoger.trow.overall.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Llandoger Trow]], an ancient public house in the heart of Bristol]]

In literature Bristol is noted as the birth place of the 18th century poet [[Thomas Chatterton]], and the poets [[Robert Southey]], who was born in Wine Street, Bristol in 1774, and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] married the Bristol Fricker sisters; and [[William Wordsworth]] spent time in the city where [[Joseph Cottle]] first published [[Lyrical Ballads]] in 1798.

The 18th and 19th century portrait painter Sir [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]] and 19th century architect [[Francis Greenway]], designer of many of [[Sydney]]'s first buildings, came from the city, and more recently the [[graffiti]] artist [[Banksy]]. Some famous comedians are locals, including [[Justin Lee Collins]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]], and writer/comedian [[Stephen Merchant]].

[[Bristol University]] graduates include the satirist [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]] of ''[[Spaced]]'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and [[Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]] of ''[[Little Britain]]'' fame. Hollywood actor [[Cary Grant]] was born in the city, [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Jane Lapotaire]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Helen Baxendale]], [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] and [[Gene Wilder]] are amongst the many actors who learnt their craft at the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]], opened by [[Sir Laurence Olivier]] in 1946 and [[Hugo Weaving]] ([[Agent Smith]], ''[[The Matrix]]'') studied at [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] School.

===Sport & leisure===
[[Image:Gloscricketground.jpg|thumb|The County Ground, [[Ashley Down]]]]
The city has two [[The Football League|League]] [[Football (soccer)|football]] clubs: [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]], as well as a [[Football teams in Bristol|number of non-league]] clubs, most notably [[Bristol Manor Farm F.C.|Bristol Manor Farm]]  The city is also home to [[Bristol Rugby]] [[rugby union]] club, a [[First-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] side, [[Gloucestershire C.C.C.]] and a [[Rugby League Conference]] side, the [[Bristol Sonics]]. The city also stages an annual [[Bristol Half Marathon|half marathon]], and in 2001 played host to the [[2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships|World Half Marathon Championships]].

In summer the grounds of [[Ashton Court]] to the west of the city play host to the [[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]], a major event for [[Hot air balloon|hot-air ballooning]] in the UK. The Fiesta draws a substantial crowd even for the early morning lift that typically begins at about 6.30 am. Events and a fairground entertain the crowds during the day. A second mass ascent is then made in the early evening, again taking advantage of lower wind speeds. Ashton Court also plays host to the [[Ashton Court festival]] each summer, an outdoors music festival which used to be known as the Bristol Community Festival.

Speedway racing was staged, with breaks, at the Knowle Stadium from 1928 to 1960 when it was closed and the site redeveloped. The sport briefly returned to the City in the 1970s when the Bulldogs raced at [[Eastville Stadium]]. The Bulldogs of 1949 whitewashed Glasgow (White City) Tigers 70 - 14.

===Media===
[[Image:Bristol International Balloon Fiesta.JPG|thumb|[[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]]]]
Bristol has a daily morning [[newspaper]], the ''[[Western Daily Press]]''; an evening paper, the [[Bristol Evening Post|''Evening Post'']]; a weekly free newspaper, the ''[[Bristol Observer]]''; and a Bristol edition of the free [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|''Metro'']] newspaper. The local weekly listings magazine, ''[[Venue (magazine)|Venue]]'', covers the city's music, theatre and arts scenes. All of these papers are owned by the [[Daily Mail and General Trust|Northcliffe Group]]. The city has several local radio stations, including [[BBC Radio Bristol]], [[Bristol's GWR FM|GWR FM]] (previously known as Radio West), [[Brunel Classic Gold|Classic Gold 1260]], [[Kiss 101]], [[Star 107.2]], BCfm (a community radio station launched March 2007), [[Original 106]] (starting summer 2007)<ref>{{cite web | title=Original 106fm Bristol | work=Original 106fm | url=http://www.original106.fm/ | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref> 
and The Hub (a student radio station).

===Dialect===

A distinctive dialect of [[English language|English]] is spoken by some Bristol inhabitants, known colloquially as ''Bristolian''. Bristol is the only large English city with a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], in which the ''r'' in words like ''car'' is pronounced. The unusual feature of this dialect, unique to Bristol, is the ''Bristol L'' (or ''terminal L''), in which an ''L'' sound is appended to words that end in an 'a' or 'o'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stoke |first=Harry |authorlink= |coauthors=Vinny Green |title=A Dictionary of Bristle |year=2003 |publisher=Broadcast Books |location=Bristol |isbn=1874092656 }}</ref> 
Thus "area" becomes "areal", etc.  This is how the city's name evolved from Brycgstow to have a final 'L' sound: Bristol. Further Bristolian linguistic features are the addition of a superfluous "to" in questions relating to direction or orientation, or using "to" instead of "at"; and using male [[pronouns]] "he", "him" instead of "it".  For example, "Where's that?" would be phrased as "Where's he to?", a feature exported to [[Newfoundland English]].<ref>{{cite web | title=An Introduction to Newfoundland Vernacular English | work=Language Variation in Canada | url=http://www.unh.edu/linguistics/courses/790CS/final.papers/NF.English.paper.htm | accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

Stanley Ellis, a long-term dialect researcher, found that many of the dialect words in the Filton area were linked to work in the aerospace industry.  He described this as "a cranky, crazy, crab-apple tree of language and with the sharpest, juiciest flavour that I've heard for a long time".<ref>Simon Elmes, "Talking for Britain", p.39</ref>

==Politics and government==
{{main|Politics of Bristol}}
[[Image:bristol1-l.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Mary Redcliffe]] church and the [[Floating Harbour]], Bristol]]
Bristol City Council consists of 70 councillors representing 35 wards. They are elected in thirds with two councillors per ward, each serving a four-year term. Wards never have both councillors up for election at the same time, so effectively two-thirds of the wards are up each election.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Council-Democracy/Democracy-Elections/future-elections.en |title= Wards up for future elections|accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Bristol City Council }}</ref> 
The Council has long been dominated by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but recently the [[Liberal Democrats]] have grown strong in the city and as the largest party took minority control of the Council at the [[2005]] election. They are no longer in control following Labour and the Conservatives vetoing the Liberal Democrats' preferred candidate, Steve Comer, in 2007. As a result, Labour rule the council under a minority administration with Conservative backing, and the council leader is Helen Holland. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6682343.stm |title=Council leader battle resolved |date= [[27 May]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-05-32 |format= |work=BBC News}}</ref> 
The Lord Mayor is Labour Councillor Royston Griffey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144936&command=displayContent&sourceNode=144919&contentPK=17333042&moduleName=InternalSearch&formname=sidebarsearch

Bristol's constituencies in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] cross the borders with neighbouring authorities, and the city is divided into Bristol [[Bristol West (UK Parliament constituency)|West]], [[Bristol East (UK Parliament constituency)|East]], [[Bristol South (UK Parliament constituency)|South]] and [[Bristol North West (UK Parliament constituency)|North-west]] and [[Kingswood (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingswood]]. [[Northavon (UK Parliament constituency)|Northavon]] also covers some of the suburbs, but none of the administrative county. At the next General Election, the boundaries will be changed to coincide with the county boundary. Kingswood will no longer cover any of the county, and a new [[Filton and Bradley Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Filton and Bradley Stoke]] constituency will include the suburbs in South Gloucestershire. There are four [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and one Liberal Democrat [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/Council-Democracy/Elected-Representatives/bristols-members-of-parliament-and-mep-listings.en |title=Bristol's Members of Parliament and Members of the European Parliament |accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Bristol City Council | date= 2005 }}</ref>

Bristol has a tradition of local political activism, and has been home to many important political figures. [[Tony Benn]], a veteran left-wing politician, was Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Bristol South East (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South East]] from 1950 to 1983. [[Edmund Burke]], MP for the [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol constituency]] for six years from 1774, famously insisted that he was a Member of Parliament first, rather than a representative of his constituents' interests. In 1963, there was a boycott of the city's buses after the Bristol Omnibus Co. refused to employ black drivers and conductors. The boycott is known to have influenced the creation of the UK's [[Race Relations Act 1965|Race Relations Act]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/race/story/0,,1638788,00.html |title=In praise of... the Race Relations Acts |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author=Alan Rusbridger |authorlink=Alan Rusbridger |coauthors= |date=[[10 November]] [[2005]] |publisher=The Guardian |pages= |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 
The women's rights campaigner [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]] (1867<U+2013>1954) was born in Bristol. The city was the scene of the first of the 1980s riots or uprisings. In St. Paul's, a number of largely African-Caribbean people rose up against racism, police harassment and mounting disatifisfaction with their social and economic circumstances before similar disturbances followed across the UK. Local support of [[fair trade]] issues was recognised in 2005 when Bristol was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/content/press-releases/2005/03/Press-Release-10584KB-05.en |title=Bristol is a Fairtrade City |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[4 March]] [[2005]] |year= |month= |format= |work=Press Release |publisher=Bristol City Council |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Bristol is unusual in having been a city with county status since medieval times. The county was expanded to include suburbs such as [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] in 1835, and it was named a [[county borough]] in 1889, when the term was first introduced.<ref name=rayfield/> However, on [[1 April]] [[1974]], it became a local government district of the short-lived county of [[Avon county|Avon]]. On [[1 April]] [[1996]], it once again regained its independence and county status, when the county of Avon was abolished and Bristol became a [[Unitary Authority]].

==Demographics==

This makes the city England's sixth most populous city, and ninth most populous metropolitan area.<ref name="ANameSoThatWeDontHaveToUseIbidForTheNextRef"/> 
At 3,599 people per [[square kilometre]] it has the seventh-highest population density of any English district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9395&More=Y |title=ONS 2005 Mid-Year Estimates | date= [[10 October]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Office of National Statistics }}</ref>

In the 2001 census 91.83% of the population described themselves as white, 2.85% as South Asian, 2.32% as black, 2.08% as mixed race, 0.56% as Chinese and 0.34% other. National averages were 90.92%, 4.58%, 2.3%, 1.31%, 0.45% and 0.44% for the same groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=10122&image.x=28&image.y=20 |title=Key Statistics 06: Ethnic group |accessdate=2007-05-12 | date=[[12 February]] [[2002]] |format= |work=Office for National Statistics, 2001 }}</ref>

==Physical geography==
[[Image:Bristol, Avon Gorge from Clifton Down.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Avon Gorge]], home to several unique plant species.]]

Bristol is in a [[limestone]] area, which runs from the [[Mendip Hills]] to the south and the [[Cotswolds]] to the north east.<ref>{{cite web | title= Cotswold Hills Geopark | url= http://www.cotswoldhillsgeopark.org/ | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>
The rivers [[River Avon, Bristol|Avon]] and [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]] cut through this limestone to the underlying clays, creating Bristol's characteristic hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through [[flood plain]]s and areas which were marshy before the growth of the city. To the west the Avon has cut through the limestone to form the [[Avon Gorge]], partly aided by glacial meltwater after the last [[ice age]]. The gorge aided in the protection of Bristol Harbour, and has been quarried for stone to build the city. The land surrounding the gorge has been protected from development, as [[The Downs (Bristol)|The Downs]] and [[Leigh Woods]]. The gorge and [[estuary]] of the Avon form the county's boundary with North Somerset, and the river flows into the [[Bristol Channel]] at [[Avonmouth]] at the mouth of the [[River Severn]]. There is another gorge in the city, in the [[Blaise Castle]] estate to the north.

Situated in the south of the country, Bristol is one of the warmest cities in the UK, with a mean annual temperature of 10.2-12&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[celsius|C]] (50-54<U+00B0>F).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif |title=Average annual temperature |accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Met Office | date= 2000 }}</ref> 
It is also amongst the sunniest, with 1541-1885 hours sunshine per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/ss/17.gif |title=Average annual sunshine |accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Met Office |date= 2000 }}</ref> 
The city is partially sheltered by [[Exmoor]] and the [[Mendip Hills]], but exposed from the [[Bristol Channel]], and annual rainfall is similar to the national average, at 741-1,060&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] (29.2&ndash;41.7&nbsp;in).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.com/climate/uk/averages/19712000/rr/17.gif |title=Average annual rainfall |accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Met Office |date= 2000 }}</ref>

==Education, science and technology==
{{main|Education in Bristol}}
[[Image:Wills Memorial Building from road during day.jpg|thumb|The University of Bristol's [[Wills Memorial Building]] - a familiar landmark at the top of Park Street]]
Bristol is home to two major institutions of higher education: the [[University of Bristol]], a "[[redbrick]]" chartered in 1909, and the [[University of the West of England]], formerly Bristol Polytechnic, which gained university status in 1992. The city also has two dedicated [[further education]] institutions, [[City of Bristol College]] and [[Filton College]], and two [[Theology|theological]] colleges, [[Trinity College, Bristol]] & [[Wesley College, Bristol]].  The city has 129 infant, junior and primary schools,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-lea.org.uk/schools/contacts/school_list_primary.html |title=List of primary schools in Bristol |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format= |work=Bristol LEA }}</ref> 
17 secondary schools,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-lea.org.uk/schools/contacts/school_list_secondary.html |title=List of secondary schools in Bristol |accessdate=2006-04-13 |format= |work=Bristol LEA }}</ref> 
and three city learning centres. There are also independent schools in the city, including [[Clifton College]], [[Colston's School]], [[Clifton High School]], [[Badminton School]], [[Bristol Cathedral School]], [[Bristol Grammar School]], [[Redland High School]], [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]] (an all-boys school) and [[Red Maids' School]], the oldest girls' school in England, founded in 1634 by John Whitson.

In 2005 the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] recognised Bristol's ties to science and technology by naming it one of three "science cities", and promising funding for further development of science in the city,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/university/vc/science-city.html |title=Vice-Chancellor's speeches and articles |accessdate=2007-05-06 |format= |work=University of Bristol | date= [[11 November]] [[2005]] }}</ref> 
with a <U+00A3>300 million "Science Park" planned at [[Emerson's Green]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4925556.stm |title=City science park partner named |accessdate=2007-05-06 |format= |work=BBC News Online | date= [[20 April]] [[2006]] }}</ref>  
As well as research at the two universities and [[Southmead Hospital]], science education is important in the city, with [[At-Bristol]], [[Bristol Zoo]], [[Bristol Festival of Nature]] and the [[Create Centre]] being prominent local institutions involved in science communication.  The city has a history of scientific achievement, including Sir [[Humphry Davy]], the 19th century scientist who worked in [[Hotwells]] and discovered [[laughing gas]]. [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]] has given the world two [[Nobel Prize]] winning physicists: [[Paul Dirac]] for crucial contributions to [[quantum mechanics]] in 1933, and [[Cecil Frank Powell]], for a photographic method of studying nuclear processes and associated discoveries in 1950. The city was birth place of [[Colin Pillinger]], planetary scientist behind the [[Beagle 2]] [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] lander project, and is home to [[Adam Hart-Davis]], presenter of various science related television programmes, the famed graffati artist [[Banksy]], and the psychologists [[Susan Blackmore]] and [[Richard Gregory]].

==Transport==
{{main|Transport in Bristol}}
[[Image:Bristol airport overview.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bristol International Airport]], Lulsgate]]

There are two principal [[railway station]]s in Bristol. [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] is located to the north of the city and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]] located in the centre. There are scheduled coach links to most major UK cities. The city is connected by road on an east-west axis from [[London]] to [[Wales]] by the [[M4 motorway]], and on a north-southwest axis from [[Birmingham]] to [[Exeter, England|Exeter]] by the [[M5 motorway]]. Also within the county is the [[M49 motorway]], a shortcut between the M5 in the south and M4 [[Severn Bridge|Severn Crossing]] in the west. The [[M32 motorway]] is a spur from the M4 to the city centre. The city is also served by its own airport, [[Bristol International Airport|Bristol International]] (BRS), at [[Lulsgate Plateau|Lulsgate]], which has seen substantial investments in its runway, terminal and other facilities since 2001.

Public transport in the city consists largely of its bus network, provided by [[First Group]]. Buses in the city have been widely criticised for being unreliable and expensive, and in 2005 First was fined for delays and safety violations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2006-01-17b.684.2 |title=Oral Answers to Questions <U+2014> Transport |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author=Kerry McCarthy, ''et al'' |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[17 January]] [[2006]] |year= |month= |format= |work=British House of Commons|House of Commons |publisher=Hansard |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4716023.stm |title=Bus firm must reduce city fleet |accessdate=2007-05-06 |format= |work=BBC News Online | date= [[25 July]] [[2005]] }}</ref>  
Use of private cars in Bristol is high, and the city suffers from congestion, which costs an estimated <U+00A3>350 million per year.<ref name=ltp06.1>{{cite web |url=http://www.greaterbristoltransportplan.org/ltp_pdf/maindoc/ltp-main-section-1.pdf |title=Joint Local Transport Plan Chapter 1 |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2006 |month= |format=PDF |work= |publisher=B&NES, Bristol City, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire councils |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 
Bristol is a [[motorcycle]] friendly city. The city recognises that motorcycle use eases congestion and encourages this allow motorcycles to use most of the city's bus lanes, as well as providing secure free parking.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Transport-Streets/Roads-highways-and-pavements/motorcycles/motorcycles.en | work= Bristol City Council | title= Motorcycles | accessdate= 2007-09-24}}</ref>
Since 2000 the city council has included a [[light rail]] system in its [[Local Transport Plan]], but has so far been unable to fund the project. The city was offered [[European Union]] funding for the system, but the [[Department for Transport]] did not provide the required additional funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/282/DC/sus_2.pdf |title=Memorandum on Government Discrimination against Innovative Low-cost Light Rail in favour of Urban Diesel Buses | date= March 2006 | accessdate=2007-05-06 |format=PDF |work=Sustraco / H.M. Treasury }}</ref> 
As well as support for public transport, there are several road building schemes supported by the local council, including re-routing and improving the [[A4174 road|South Bristol Ring Road]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gbsts.com/ |title=Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study Chapter 6 |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author=Atkins |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= 2005 |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> 
There are also three [[park and ride]] sites serving the city, supported by the local council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/content/Transport-Streets/Public-Transport/park-and-ride.en |title=Park and Ride |accessdate=2007-05-08 |publisher=Bristol City Council}}</ref> 
The central part of the city has water-based transport, operated as the [[Bristol Ferry Boat]], which provides both leisure and commuter services on the harbour.

Bristol was never well served by suburban railways, though the [[Severn Beach Line]] to Avonmouth and [[Severn Beach]] survived the [[Beeching Axe]] and is still in operation. The [[Portishead Railway]] was closed to passengers under the Beeching Axe, but was relaid in 2000-2002 as far as the [[Royal Portbury Dock]] with a [[Strategic Rail Authority]] rail-freight grant. Plans to relay a further three miles of track to [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]], a largely [[dormitory town]] with only one connecting road, have been discussed but there is insufficient funding to rebuild stations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2005-01-24.134.0&m=841 |title=Bristol-Portishead Rail Link |accessdate=2007-05-12 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=[[24 January]] [[2005]] |work=House of Commons Debate |publisher=Hansard |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Despite being hilly, Bristol is one of the prominent cycling cities of England, and is home to the national cycle campaigning group [[Sustrans]]. It has a number of urban cycle routes, as well as links to [[National Cycle Network]] routes to Bath and London, to Gloucester and Wales, and to the south-western peninsula of England. Cycling has grown rapidly in the city, with a 21% increase in journeys between 2001 and 2005.<ref name=ltp06.1/>

==Twin cities==
[[Image:040424 026 avonmouth.jpg|thumb|The Avon Estuary]]
Bristol was amongst the first cities to adopt the idea of [[town twinning]]. In 1947 it was twinned with [[Bordeaux]] and [[Hanover]], the first post-war twinning of British and German cities. It is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol-city.gov.uk/ccm/navigation/leisure-and-culture/tourism-and-travel/town-twinning/ |title=Town twinning |accessdate=2007-05-12 |format= |work=Bristol City Council }}</ref>
