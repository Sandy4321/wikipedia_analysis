'''Charles Pearce''' (born 1943) is a [[calligrapher]]. His work may be found in collections around the globe, including members of the [[British Royal Family]]. He is recognized  for the strength and beauty of his [[letterforms]] and his calligraphy manuals are recommended to their students by calligraphy teachers around the world.

Born Charles Rothwell Pearce in Aston, [[Birmingham, England]] the eldest son of Charles Kenneth Rothwell Pearce, an English and Drama teacher, later Headmaster, and Winifred Helen Mary Pearce (n<U+00E9>e Evans), a concert pianist. He has two brothers, Robert and Julian, and a sister, Barbara. 

In 1966, he married Linda Margaret (n<U+00E9>e Cook), and lived for three years in Palmers Green, London, before moving to Hertford in 1969 and then to Ware, Hertfordshire. They have three sons Charles Mark Rothwell (b. 1967), Aaron Xavier (b. 1972) and Daniel Alexander (b. 1977). Pearce and his wife were divorced in 1979.

==Education==

He studied at [[Tettenhall College]] (Wolverhampton, England), and the Leek School of Arts and Crafts (Leek, Staffordshire, England). At the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] (London, England), he studied with Dorothy Mahoney, William Gardner and Ann Camp. At the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] (London, England), he studied under [[Donald Jackson (calligrapher)|Donald Jackson]] and Sidney Bendall, graduating with a National Diploma in Design at Special Level in Writing and Illuminating and Lettering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blackandwhiteconference.com/pages/charlespearce.html | title=Black and White Conference | accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Professional years==

After graduation Pearce went to work for [[Decca Record Company]] in their studio in Lambeth, England designing record sleeves and promotional literature, and then on to a small advertising agency in the West End of London. He left there to become an assistant to both Donald Jackson and Sidney Bendall. He worked with Bendall for some four years designing and cutting letters in stone and wood, but remained with  Jackson for almost fifteen years. 

In 1971 he was made a Fellow of the [[Society of Scribes & Illuminators]]. Pearce and Jackson continued to work together until late in 1979. They worked on many commissions which came into Jackson's studio. One of the many commissions carried out included a huge family tree which measured 8&nbsp;ft by 4&nbsp;ft, and was a large board covered with a cow hide which had been prepared as for vellum. A large amount of his time during this period was involved in the design and signage for Cranks Health Foods until they were taken over by Guinness. 

In 1980 Pearce moved to [[New York City]] to live and work. Much of the work he undertook while living in New York was for two major clients, Pentalic Corporation and RKO Century Warner Theaters.

Pearce moved to Cleveland in 1991 and worked in the design studios of [[American Greetings]] for almost ten years during which time he trained in the use of computer technology in the world of greeting card design. He finally left to go back to working freelance and was granted a contract by AG for 16 months to give him the opportunity to work his way back into that market.

==Freelance work==

Pearce began to use brushes on canvas rather than pens and paper which gave him the opportunity to work considerably larger than previously. He has developed a technique which involves the throwing of paint onto raw canvas, to create the start of his paintings. He then stretches the canvas onto frames/stretchers which he has designed specially to take the force of stretching the canvas, which doesn't involve any cross-bracing. His largest single canvas to date measures 5&nbsp;ft by 9&nbsp;ft. 

It was on a visit back to [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]], where he had taught a workshop back in 1988, that he was suddenly struck by the idea that he no longer needed to live in Cleveland and could, in fact, do something which he had wanted to do for much of his life which was to live in the country. In late 2000 he bought 12 acres just outside Eureka Springs and began work on designing and constructing a studio in which he could also live. The studio was completed in 2003. Pearce's home and studio is called Whiskey Spring Studio.<ref name="Eureka Springs Artists">{{cite web | url=http://www.eurekaspringsartists.com/artistdetail.php?id=51 | accessdate=December 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Teaching==

Pearce has gained worldwide recognition and has taught widely on three continents. His workshops around North America are very well-attended and he teaches a variety of subjects involved in the calligraphic arts. He is always willing to travel and fairly recently completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand in which he taught nine workshops and gave five lectures in seven weeks. His most recent workshops saw him teaching two three-weekend workshops, one in Chicago and one in Montreal, Canada, on the history and execution of Roman Monumental Capitals. His one regret is that in the thirty-odd years since he left his native Britain, he has never been invited back to teach.
