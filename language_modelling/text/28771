==Ferdinand Lindheimer==
[[Ferdinand Lindheimer|Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer]] (1801<U+2013>1879) was known as the father of Texas [[Botany]]. Born in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], Lindheimer emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1834 to escape persecution resulting from his political activities. After military participation in Texas, Lindheimer moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to partner in botanical research with [[George Engelmann]] and [[Asa Gray]]. His research brought him in touch with [[John O. Meusebach]], after which Lindheimer moved back to Texas where he spent the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ferdinand Lindheimer|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fli04|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>

==Saltbox house==
Lindheimer built his [[Timber-framed|timber-framed]] house in 1852, in the [[Saltbox|saltbox]] style, with the roof at the back of his house sloping lower than the roof at the front of the house.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Cyril M|title=Dictionary of Architecture and Construction|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071452373|page=845}}</ref> Stucco covers the fachwerk totally on three sides of Lindheimer's house, but leaves it exposed in the back.

A centralized chimney heats the home. The front of the house has two [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]], paneled doors. In 1853, Lindheimer became the editor of the ''Die Neu Braunfels Zeitung'', and published it out of his home for the next two decades, converting the rear of his house into a print shop. The New Braunfels Conservation Society operates the house as a museum.<ref>{{cite journal|last=German American Historical Society|coauthors=National German-American Alliance; Union of Old German Students in America|journal=German American Annals,|year=1908|volume=6|page=337|publisher=German American Historical Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NRHP Lindheimer House|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/common/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2070000744&site_name=Lindheimer+House&class=2001|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>
