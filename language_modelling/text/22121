The '''Grand Central''' shuttle platforms date from the [[History of the IRT subway before 1918|original IRT subway]], opened in 1904. The station was an express stop with two island platforms between the local and express tracks.

The present configuration of the shuttle has three tracks coming into the station; the old southbound express track was removed. There is no connection between the northbound local track (track 4) and the other two. [[Island platform]]s are located between both pairs of tracks; the southernmost platform is wide, covering the area where the southbound express track (track 2) had been located. The two platforms connect directly, as tracks 3 and 4 terminate at [[bumper block]]s. The south track (track 1) merges with the southbound local track of the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line|Lexington Avenue Line]]. This merge is used to supply rolling stock to tracks 1 & 3 of the shuttle train (via a manual switch just west of station to track 3), and occasionally during special railfan excursions. The other three original tracks followed similar paths until the Lexington Avenue Line was extended north, turning this part of the line into a shuttle.

The Public Service Commission planned a new platform for the shuttle, and ending close to the Lexington Avenue Line station. The platform was constructed, but it was never used. The wall and roof of the old subway were removed at the curve just south of the old Grand Central station, and trackways were built continuing east under 42nd Street, to bring those two tracks into the new station, which was a narrow island platform between the two tracks. The unused trackways of the proposed shuttle platform were covered with wooden flooring, and the width of the station was finished up as a passageway between the Lexington Avenue Line and Shuttle stations.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/GrandCentral.widewest.jpg ''"We are in the northern trackway of the unused shuttle station, looking west toward the open shuttle station, which can be seen in the left background. In the left foreground is the last column in the row of heavy columns down the middle of the unfinished station. Beyond, the northern trackway would have run straight into the old uptown local track, which would be in view if we could remove the walled enclosure with the double doors. To the left of that, the space between the thinner rows of columns lines up with the old uptown station platform, and the other shuttle track would have run parallel to the left of that into the former uptown express track."'']</ref> The wooden flooring in the unused station platform was replaced by concrete in 1946. The space of the proposed platform is now used as a walkway that continues to the Lexington Avenue Line station.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM0yuH_T2eA YouTube]. YouTube. Retrieved on 2013-07-26.</ref>

The former downtown express track between this station and Times Square <U+2013> 42nd Street was removed in 1975.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/grandcentral.html</ref>

The platforms are actually wheelchair accessible as the mezzanine elevators are on the same level, but due to the platforms at [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]] being inaccessible, this shuttle itself is not accessible.

This section of the complex is frequently used for movie shooting when it is closed. Notable scenes include a famous scene in the 1971 film ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', an episode of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', an episode of ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', and an episode of ''[[30 Rock]]'' (filling in for [[47th<U+2013>50th Streets <U+2013> Rockefeller Center (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Rockefeller Center Station]]).

'''Grand Central'''  (formerly '''42nd Street <U+2013> Grand Central''') on the Flushing Line has a single [[island platform]] and two tracks.

There is a large round ceiling, making the platform similar to some stations in the [[London Underground]], [[Paris Metro]] and systems in [[Eastern Europe]] (it is also similar to the [[Roosevelt Island (IND 63rd Street Line)|Roosevelt Island]], [[168th Street (IRT Broadway <U+2013> Seventh Avenue Line)|168th Street (IRT platforms)]], and [[181st Street (IRT Broadway <U+2013> Seventh Avenue Line)|181st Street]] stations in other parts of Manhattan). Along the platform are stairs and escalators to other lines and to a [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] and passageways under the [[Grand Central Terminal]] concourse. Exits and entrances are located at the center, west and east ends of the platform. There is an [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] elevator toward the west end. A newsstand/snack shop is located on the platform towards the east end.

There was a plan to connect the Flushing line to the 42nd Street shuttle, just west of the Grand Central station. Some ramp work was built just for this purpose.<ref name="columbia.edu">http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/GrandCentral.ps.gif</ref> The connecting walkways from the 42nd Street Shuttle to the Flushing Line platform are the ramps.<ref name="columbia.edu"/> Also there are two remaining sections of the old trolley loop at Grand Central that remain intact and are accessible to MTA personnel via the southbound track approximately 200 feet outside of this station.<ref>[http://www.nycsubway.org/lines/flushing.html ''Remnants of the Manhattan loop still exist, but are not accessible by passengers, since these remnants are occupied by machinery. The Manhattan loop is just west of the current Grand Central Station stop on the Flushing line.'']</ref> The third is between the tracks and is a pump room.

'''Grand Central <U+2013> 42nd Street''' is an express [[metro station|station]] on the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]]. It was also known as the '''Diagonal Station''' at time of construction, being oriented 45<U+00B0> from the street grid. It has two [[island platform]]s, four tracks, and includes a crossover and a crossunder. The columns and beams here are massive, in order to support part of [[Grand Central Terminal]] and the office towers next to it.

On one wall, there is a stylized steam locomotive mosaic. The northbound platform's side wall includes tile depicting a big passageway; the first room, as seen from the platform, has doors to a second room which appears to be a mechanical room. There is a correctly oriented compass rose inlaid on the floor of the mezzanine.

The southbound local track south of the station merges into the original downtown local track from the [[42nd Street Shuttle|IRT 42nd Street Shuttle]]. The track was part of the [[History of the IRT subway before 1918|original four-track IRT subway]]. This track is now used for moving trains to and from the shuttle and for launching [[railfan]] trips from the shuttle tracks. This was the only track that is preserved.

Just south of the station, the tracks split, with two on each side of the 1870 [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] [[Murray Hill Tunnel]] which is now used for automobile traffic on Park Avenue.

The Grand Central complex is home to the master tower which controls the entire Lexington Avenue Line, located south of the Lexington Avenue Line platforms.

The uptown tracks are about ten feet below the original grade at the point where they turn off. The old uptown express and local trackways that used to lead to the 42nd Street Shuttle are visible from the uptown local track. As the alignment of the original trackways curves into the old Grand Central station on the 42nd Street Shuttle, it passes through the rebuilt area for the proposed Grand Central station shuttle platform. From the public passageway, none of the original support columns and roof are visible, since they were removed in exactly this area to open the way for the unused shuttle station. The unused ramps leading from the 42nd Street Shuttle are still in place, just south of this station.

The [[New York City Transit Authority]] had a scheme in the early 1950s to make a lower level to the station, also of four tracks. It would tap into the express tracks beyond the station and be used as an intermediate terminal stop for certain services. There is room between the station and the [[IRT Flushing Line|Flushing Line]] for such a new level.

[[File:Grand Central subway 1918.jpg|thumb|1918 plan]]
An east-west passageway connects the mezzanine, above the Flushing Line and Lexington Avenue Line platforms, to the [[42nd Street Shuttle]] and has numerous exits into [[Grand Central Terminal]], to the street level at and directly into several buildings along 42nd Street, including: the [[Chrysler Building]] through a passage immediately to the left of the customer service booth on the station's mezzanine, 125 Park Avenue, 110 East 42nd Street through a passage downtown of the main mezzanine through their own fare control, 122 East 42nd Street through its own turnstiles directly accessing the escalators to the [[IRT Flushing Line]] platform (east of the mezzanine), and numerous others by walking through exits uptown and to the west into [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Jeremiah|title=Grand Central-42nd Street|url=http://subwaynut.com/ct/gct_456/|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> An exit outside of the planned [[One Vanderbilt]] is proposed.<ref>http://secondavenuesagas.com/2014/09/09/one-vanderbilt-renderings-before-and-after/</ref>

The station has undergone various recent renovations, but some of the passages still require repair or renovation. At the same time, a project was ongoing to air cool the station in conjunction with [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s project to cool Grand Central Terminal. However, {{as of|2006|lc=yes}}, only the Lexington Avenue Line station is air-cooled.

Original plans for [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] (at that time the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]]) had it extending north and east from its current northern terminal at [[33rd Street (PATH station)|33rd Street]]/[[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|6th Avenue]] to Grand Central. Space was left for the platforms and line, but it was never built.<ref>[http://www.hudsoncity.net/tubesenglish/galleryframeset.html Diagram of proposed H&M platforms]</ref>

Except for the 42nd Street Shuttle (which is inaccessible at its other station at [[Times Square (IRT 42nd Street Shuttle)|Times Square]]), the whole station is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|handicapped accessible]], as is the connection to [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://web.mta.info/accessibility/stations.htm| title=MTA Guide to Accessible Transit| work=MTA.info| accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref>
