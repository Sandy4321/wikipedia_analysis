The '''Paute Dam''', also known as the '''Daniel Palacios Dam''' and the '''Amaluza Dam''', is the largest [[hydroelectric]] plant in [[Ecuador]]. It is located on the [[Paute River]], 125 km from [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]. After the privatization of power generation that began in 1996 under the government of [[Sixto Dur<U+00E1>n Ball<U+00E9>n]], the dam passed into the hands of the company [[Hidropaute SA]] and then returned to state ownership during the government of Rafael Correa when Hidropaute became part of the Ecuador Electricity Corporation (''Corporaci<U+00F3>n El<U+00E9>ctrica del Ecuador'', CELEC).

Paute was constructed between 1976 and 1983 on the Paute River and designed on the premise that it would be erected upstream of the [[Mazar Dam]].

In late 2009, low water levels at the dam were the primary cause of an [[2009 Ecuador electricity crisis|electricity crisis in Ecuador]].
