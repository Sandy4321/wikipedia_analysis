A '''film still''' (sometimes called a '''publicity still''' or a '''production still''') is a [[photograph]] taken on or off the set of a [[Film|movie]] or [[television program]] during [[Film production|production]]. These photographs are also taken in formal studio settings and venues of opportunity such as film stars' homes, film debut events, and commercial settings. The photos were taken by [[movie stills photographer|studio photographers]] for [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] purposes. Such stills consisted of posed portraits, used for public display or free fan handouts, which are sometimes autographed. They can also consist of posed or candid images taken on the set during production, and may include stars, crew members or directors at work.

The main purpose of such publicity stills is to help studios advertise and promote their new films and stars. Studios therefore send those photos along with press kits and free passes to as many movie-related publications as possible so as to gain free publicity. Such photos were then used by newspapers and magazines, for example, to write stories about the stars or the films themselves. Hence, the studio gains free publicity for its films, while the publication gains free stories for its readers.

== Types of stills ==
Shots can be taken as part of the filming or separately posed. During the course of filming, the still photographer shutters on-stage scenes.  These photographs  are called production stills.  Another type of still generated during filming is the off-stage shot. The photographer makes these while actors are between takes, in costume, perhaps smoking a cigarette or drinking a coke or a cup of coffee.  Separately posed stills include a wide variety of shots.  Many of these have self-explanatory designations: seasonal gag shots, leg art, fashion stills, commercial tie-ups, poster art, clinch shots (special posing for print advertising)  candids (done normally with one source lighting<U+2014>think snapshot) and in-costume studies (most economically done off-stage in a sound stage corner or more formally in a studio setting). By far the most popular of these many kinds of film stills  are those portraying glamour, menace or gag interpretations. 

Other separately posed images include <U+201C>set<U+201D> stills, make-up stills and wardrobe stills.  These stills are used for matching from scene to scene, or for recreating a scene later for a re-take.  All details of the set, the costume and the cast make-up have to be exact, and these stills serve as a useful resource to get that accomplished. Background <U+201C>plates<U+201D> or <U+201C>stereos<U+201D>, another type of still, enable the studio to create location scenes without leaving the premises, thus reducing the ultimate cost of production. <ref>[http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/authorship.html Still Photography in the Motion Picture Industry] Ned Scott, 1943 (See scanned article on page)</ref>

Movie still photography is considered a separate branch of movie making, that of marketing: "a photographer usually works on set but is not directly involved in the making of a film. His role is to publicize, through his pictures, film and actors on magazines, newspapers and other media."<ref>Ferrari, Angelo. ''PROCEEDINGS 4th International Congress on <U+201C>Science and Technology for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage in the Mediterranean Basin<U+201D> VOL. I'', (2009) p. 355</ref> 
Film producer and cinematographer Brian Dzyak explains that the group of people who work on a film are referred to as the "company" or "unit." Among the professionals who are assigned to the unit, one is a "unit still photographer," whose job is to take still photos that the studios will later use for marketing. They may take photos during rehearsals or while standing next to the cameraman during filming of [[take]]s.<ref>Dzyak, Brian. ''What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood'', Random House (2008) p. 303-304</ref> For glamour publicity stills, given out to the public and press to promote a particular star, "special shoots" are made in separate studios, containing controlled lighting, backgrounds, clothing and furnishings.<ref>Jones, Chris. ''The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook'' Continuum International Publishing Group (2006) p. 345</ref>

Although the still photographer shares a number of skills and functions with the cinematographer, their work is essentially very different. The cinematographer is concerned with filming short scenes that will later be edited into an entire movie. The still photographer is primarily concerned with capturing dramatic photos that will draw attention when used on posters, DVD covers, and advertising.<ref>Editors of Photopreneur. ''99 Ways TO Make Money From Your Photos'', New Media Entertainment, Ltd. (2009) p. 294</ref> Studios would therefore assign a still photographer to a production, and in some cases as many as five still photographers worked on the same film. 

Some stars, including [[Rita Hayworth]], chose which photographer they wanted, in her case, Robert Coburn. Other notable still photographers were [[George Hurrell]] and [[Clarence Bull]], known for being [[Greta Garbo]]'s chosen photographer.<ref name=Pepper>Pepper, Terence, and Kobal, John. ''The Man Who Shot Garbo'', Simon and Schuster (1989)</ref><ref> ''Heritage Vintage Movie Photography & Stills Auction #7003'', Heritage Auctions (2009)</ref> [[Katharine Hepburn]] recalls her feelings when he also photographed her:

{{quote|Clarence Bull was one of the greats <U+2014> I was thrilled when I went to MGM to know that he was going to photograph me. I was terrified <U+2014> Was I interesting enough? <br>He had done Garbo for years <U+2014> The pictures were extraordinary. Her head <U+2014> his lighting <U+2014> they combined into something unique.<ref name=Pepper/>}}

The major and minor film studios have always used still photos of stars, typically in a posed portrait, to send to the media to create "a buzz" for both their stars and any new films they were appearing in. Studios "sent out tens of thousands of scene stills and portraits to newspapers, magazines, and fans each year. Such photographs were rarely marked with the photographer's name or with a credit line."<ref name=Museum>''Hollywood glamour, 1924-1956'', Elvehjem Museum of Art, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison (1987)</ref> 

Accordingly, the studio publicity departments used the stills "to sell a product," namely, a "particular film or an individual actor or actress." The distinction is relevant: "While the scene stills and on-the-set candid shots would be used to sell the movie, the portraits could be used to introduce a would-be star to an international audience. . . . The portrait photographer's function was to create and sell the image created by a publicity department around the life and look of a real person." The photos portrayed a star "without a role to hide behind. . . [and the photographer] had to recognize the image which would serve as the essence of a lengthy publicity campaign, capturing it in a fraction of a second." The glamour close-up would become "Hollywood's principal contribution to still portraiture."<ref name=Museum/>

Beyond basic publicity purposes, film stills were given to the actors themselves to send, signed or unsigned, to their fans and fan clubs. At various special events, stars might bring along a stack of these studio photos to sign in the presence of admirers, much like book signings by authors today.

In addition, directors and casting directors involved with placing appropriate actors in the film roles still rely on film stills to help them recall the detailed looks of actors. This is similar to the way magazine or TV advertisers rely on stills taken of professional models. Typically, a film still included a separate profile sheet describing the physical details of the actor along with a brief bio. The directors would then collect their best choices and schedule interviews and auditions.<ref>Kobal, John. ''Movie-star portraits of the forties: 163 glamor photos'', Dover Publ., 1977</ref>

==Artistic significance==
Maxine Ducey, film archive director, has summarized the significance and contributions of the early film stills to the film industry:
{{quote|The curtain has long been rung down on the golden age of Hollywood portraiture, but the portraits made by the Hollywood glamour photographers remain on stage. The photographs are a testimony to the photographers' skill and agility, as well as to their aesthetic sensibilities. Studying these portraits, we can never forget the talent of the photographers. We have proof of their consummate ability to capture in a single image the essence of a star, and to communicate that information to a film viewer, magazine reader or studio executive. Hollywood portrait photographers were not seen as artists or creators, yet one has only to examine their legacy to be convinced of the enduring quality of their vision as well as their craft.<ref name=Museum/>}}

As explained by film production manager Eve Light Honthaner,<ref>Ms. Honthaner has held production management positions at Orion Pictures and Dream works and taught at USC School of Cinematic Arts. She is also the founder of the Los Angeles-based organization Film Industry Network. See [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393414/otherworks IMDB Eve Light Honthaner Other works] and  [http://www.writersstore.com/authors/eve-light-honthaner Eve Light Honthaner]</ref> publicity photos taken to promote a film actor or other celebrity were not usually copyrighted and were intended to remain free for publications to use wherever possible:
:"Publicity photos (star headshots) have traditionally not been copyrighted. Since they are disseminated to the public, they are generally considered public domain, and therefore clearance by the studio that produced them is not necessary...."<ref name=Honathaner>Honathaner, Eve Light. ''The Complete Film Production Handbook'', Focal Press, (2001) p. 211</ref>

Honathaner distinguishes "Publicity Photos (star headshots)" from "Production Stills (photos taken on the set of the film or TV show during the shooting)", noting that production stills "must be cleared with the studio".<ref name=Honathaner/> Creative Clearance offers the same text as Honathaner, but adds that newer publicity stills may contain a copyright.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.creativeclearance.com/guidelines.html#B |title=Photography Clearance |author= Creative Clearance |work=Clearance Guidelines for Producers |accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, media lawyer Nancy Wolff,<ref>Ms. Wolff represents many media companies and has lectured widely on copyright issues [http://cdas.com/attorneys/nancy_wolff/ Website of Law firm of CDAS] She is the author of ''The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook'' [http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Photographers-Legal-Handbook/dp/1581154771]</ref> wrote with respect to the "photo archive of entertainment industry publicity pictures, historic still images widely distributed by the studios to advertise and promote their then new releases":
<blockquote>It has been assumed that these images are most likely in the public domain or owned by studios that freely distributed the images without any expectation of compensation. Archives will lend these images for a fee to publishers and producers of documentaries for 'editorial' uses, in keeping with the original intent to publicize the movie or promote the actor. Seeing these images in print years later, some photographers, or their heirs, attempt to assert rights that most believed to be extinguished or abandoned.<ref name="Wolff2007">{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Nancy E.|title=The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMlIIp34sD0C|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=29 May 2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-58115-477-1|page=55}}</ref></blockquote>
As a result, she indicates:
<blockquote>There is a vast body of photographs, including but not limited to publicity stills, that have no notice as to who may have created them.... Without knowing where the photos came from, or what long lost parent may appear and claim the 'orphaned work,' licensing the work becomes risky business. For publishers, museums, and other archives that are risk-averse, this leads to a large body of works that will never be published.<ref name="Wolff2007">{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Nancy E.|title=The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMlIIp34sD0C|accessdate=19 December 2011|date=29 May 2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-58115-477-1|page=57}}</ref></blockquote>

Film historian Gerald Mast<ref>Dr. Mast was an author, film historian and chairman of the English department at the University of Chicago [http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/obituaries/gerald-mast-48-dies-wrote-histories-of-film.html NYTimes obituary for Gerald Mast]</ref> explains how the new 1989 copyright revisions only protected publicity works that complied with all earlier requirements in addition to filing a copyright registration within 5 years of first publication:
<blockquote>According to the old copyright act, such production stills were not automatically copyrighted as part of the film and required separate copyrights as photographic stills. The new copyright act similarly excludes the production still from automatic copyright but gives the film's copyright owner a five-year period in which to copyright the stills. Most studios have never bothered to copyright these stills because they were happy to see them pass into the public domain, to be used by as many people in as many publications as possible."<ref name=Mast>Mast, Gerald. "Film Study and the Copyright Law", from ''Cinema Journal'', Winter 2007, pp. 120-127</ref></blockquote>

In a federal appeals case brought by Warner Bros. Entertainment, decided on July 5, 2011, the court recognized that the "publicity material images for the films [that] were distributed directly to the general public through newspapers and magazines" were public domain because they were not separately registered for copyright and their dissemination constituted general publication. It quoted from [[David Nimmer|''Nimmer on Copyright'']], the primary copyright treatise, which explains that, while films were generally registered for copyright protection, "much less care was typically exercised during production and in the publicity office" with photographs taken of the actors on set being "sent off to newspapers before the film<U+2019>s release, in order to generate a buzz about its opening."<ref>[http://www.law.com/jsp/decision.jsp?id=1202499867260 Warner Bros.

===Fair use===
Kristin Thompson, committee chair of the [http://www.cmstudies.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=122#c1 Society for Cinema and Media Studies] writes in the conclusion of a 1993 conference with cinema scholars and editors, that they "expressed the opinion that it is not necessary for authors to request permission to reproduce frame enlargements. . . [and] some trade presses that publish educational and scholarly film books also take the position that permission is not necessary for reproducing frame enlargements and publicity photographs."<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, Kristin. [http://www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/docs/fairusefilmstills.pdf] "Report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Society For Cinema
Studies, "Fair Usage Publication of Film Stills"  "Society for Cinema and Media Studies", 1993 conference</ref>

Thompson also notes that even if such images are not already public domain, they could be considered "fair use" under its guidelines:
:"Most frame enlargements are reproduced in books that clearly fall into the first provision's categories of "teaching," "criticism," "scholarship," or "research," and hence there seems little doubt that such illustrations would qualify as fair use by this criterion. Since most university presses are nonprofit institutions, illustrations in their books and journals would be more likely to fall into the fair-use category than would publications by more commercial presses."<ref name=Thompson/>

In addition, the burden of proof of copyright for such publicity images would fall on the studios producing them, states Thompson:
:"If such a photograph has been circulated for publication at some point and reproduced without a copyright notice accompanying it, it should then fall within the public domain. Throughout the history of the cinema, many publicity photos have appeared in newspapers and magazines without such notices. If a scholar or educator were to publish a publicity photo, the burden of proof would then fall on the studio or distributor to prove that the still had never been published without the copyright notice.<ref name=Thompson/>
