'''River Song''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Alex Kingston]] in the long-running [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|science-fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[Executive producer]] [[Russell T Davies]] describes her as "one of the most important characters we've seen in the series." <ref>"River Song is one of the most important characters we've seen in the series... someone who is vital to his life" - Russell T Davies, ''Doctor Who Confidential'', Series 4, Episode 9</ref>

== Character history ==
River Song is an archaeologist who states that she has travelled with [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his relative future (her relative past).<ref>"Here's a woman who travels with the Doctor, therefore she knows him" - director Euros Lyn to Alex Kingston, ''Doctor Who Confidential'', Series 4, Episode 9)</ref><ref>"You took me to Derillium, to see the Singing Towers. Oh, what a night that was." - River Song, "Forest of the Dead"</ref> She is referred to in ''Doctor Who Confidential'' as a "[[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]-to-come",<ref>"The future is already written for both the Doctor and his adventurous companion-to-come" - Narration: ''Doctor Who Confidential'', Series 4, Episode 9</ref> and although the Doctor first meets her on The Library planet in "[[Silence in the Library]]", she states that she has met him on several prior occasions in her relative timeline, but in a time yet to come for the Doctor, referring to specific events and places including the "crash of the ''Byzantium''," "picnic at Asgard" and "the Singing Towers."<ref>"Crash of the Byzantium, have we done that yet? .... Picnic at Asgard. Have we done Asgard yet?" - River Song, "Silence in the Library"</ref><ref>"It's ok, it's not over for you. You'll see me again. You've got all of that to come. You and me, time and space, you watch us run." - River Song, "Forest of the Dead"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2008/06/11/dr-who-forest-of-the-dead-review/ |title=Dr Who Forest of the Dead Review |publisher=Slice of SciFi |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Fickett |first=Travis |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/885/885301p1.html |title=IGN: Forest of the Dead Review |publisher=Tv.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref>

It is suggested that at some point they share an intimate relationship of some sort, and River Song reveals that she knows the Doctor's [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#"Doctor who?"|real name]], which she whispers in his ear, thus gaining his trust.<ref>"One day I'm going to be someone you'll trust.. completely. " - River Song, "Forest of the Dead"</ref><ref>"River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear. There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could." - the Doctor, to River Song, "Forest of the Dead"</ref> River appears to be familiar with the [[TARDIS]],<ref>"The squareness gun ended up in the Tardis" ... "it's the same squareness gun, it's Captain Jack's older one, pilfered from the Tardis locker by River Song" - Steven Moffat, ''Doctor Who Confidential'', Series 4, Episode 9)</ref> and apparently has first-hand knowledge of the Doctor's future encounters with alien races.<ref>"I've seen whole armies turn and run away and he'd just swagger off back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers" - River Song, "Silence in the Library"</ref><ref>"It's a tempting thing isn't it? I mean, there it is, there's you future, there's what's going to happen to you... There's a handy guide to how to win against the... the other monsters, you know? Of course you'd want to have a little look" - Steven Moffat, referring to River Song's diary, ''Doctor Who Confidential'', Series 4, Episode 9</ref>

She possesses a [[sonic screwdriver]], which she claims a future Doctor gave her. This is cited as evidence of his trust in her, and the Doctor considers it highly surprising she should have it <U+2013> claiming he would never give anyone else his sonic screwdriver. River Song dies while using her brain as a memory buffer for The Library's data core, thus saving the Doctor, [[Donna Noble]], and the 4,023 people trapped in the data core in "[[Forest of the Dead]]", although in the last minutes of the show, the Doctor searches the sonic screwdriver he left her and finds a communications device similar to the ones used in the Lux Industries' suits, and is able to store a digital impression of her personality (thus "saving" her) onto the "hard drive" in the planet's core.

In a clip from "[[The Time of Angels]]" shown on BBC America during the show "Doctor Who: The Ultimate Guide", River Song is shown piloting the TARDIS in company of the Doctor and Amy Pond. She knows how to land it without the "whirring" sound.

== Production  and casting == 
For the role of River Song, whom [[executive producer]] [[Russell T Davies]] described as "sort of the Doctor's wife", the production sought to cast [[Kate Winslet]]. One of Winslet's first acting roles was in the [[BBC One|BBC1]] teen drama ''[[Dark Season]]'', written by Davies. The role of River Song eventually went to [[Alex Kingston]], about whom Davies said, "I bloody love her!"<ref>Davies, Russell T; Benjamin Cook (2008-09-17). "The Next Doctor". The Times. Retrieved 2008-09-17.</ref>

About her role on the series, Kingston said "We just clicked. I've done guest roles on other shows, but rarely have I felt such a warm bond.".<ref name="radiotimes1">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/alex-kingston-on-doctor-who/ |title=Alex Kingston on Doctor Who - Radio Times, 31 May 2008 |publisher=Radio Times |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> About the ''Doctor Who'' dialogue, she says "I'd work with a medical consultant on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', who'd explain what we were saying, so I'd say it with a purpose and a truth. On ''[[Doctor Who]]'', I've no idea what some of my lines mean!"<ref name="radiotimes2">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/alex-kingston-guest-stars/ |title=Alex Kingston guest-stars - Radio Times, 31 May 2008 |publisher=Radio Times |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref>

About working with Kingston, [[Catherine Tate]] said, "I'm a huge ''ER'' fan. When you hold people in awe, it's almost a disappointment when they come in and they're utterly normal. But Alex isn't disappointing at all. She's such a lovely person." [[David Tennant]] was quoted as saying "Alex is terrific. When she's telling you stories about hanging out with [[George Clooney]], you know she's pretty cool."<ref name="radiotimes2"/>
