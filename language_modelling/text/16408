'''AVAir Flight 3378''' was a scheduled flight from [[Raleigh-Durham Airport]] to [[Richmond International Airport]] which crashed after takeoff from Raleigh-Durham airport late in the night. All 12 people on board were killed in the accident.

== Accident sequence ==

The weather at the time of the accident included a low ceiling and low visibility.<ref>[http://www.airsafe.com/events/airlines/american.htm Plane Crashes Since 1970 For American Airlines]</ref>

AVAir Flight 3378 took off from [[Raleigh-Durham Airport]] at 21:25 local time and climbed to a height of 300 feet. Shortly after, the last transmission from the aircraft to the [[air traffic control]] was heard. The aircraft maintained an appropriate climb [[speed]] but at an excessive rate of turn, 40 to 45 degrees; a standard turn rate would have been 22 degrees. Due to the turn, the plane started to descend. The aircraft then struck the water in a [[reservoir]] 100 feet from the [[shoreline]], at a point 5100 feet west of [[runway]] 23R. The wreckage then continued onto land and into a forest. Some post-crash fires also were seen at the crash site, but were quickly extinguished.<ref name="ASN">{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19880219-1 |title=ASN Aircraft Accident Swearingen Metroliner III N622AV |publisher=aviation-safety.net |accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="AirDisaster.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR88-10.pdf |title=Airdisaster.com PDF AVAir Flight 3378|publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>

This accident was rated as unsurvivable by the NTSB due to extreme destruction of the aircraft.<ref name=AirDisaster.com/>

== Investigation ==

The NTSB published its report into the disaster on 13 December 1988. They found that the preliminary cause of the accident was the failure of the [[flight crew]] to maintain a proper [[flight path]] because of the improper instrument scanning by the first officer and the flight crew's response to a perceived fault in the [[stall warning]] system. Contributing features were the lack of company response to difficulties in the first officer's piloting and the lack of FAA surveillance of AVAir.<ref name=ASN/><ref name=AirDisaster.com/>

In 1993, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) filed a [[petition]] against the findings of the investigation and asked it to be reconsidered. The NTSB accepted the petition in part. The causes of the crash were changed to: "The probable cause of this accident was the failure of flight crew to maintain a proper flightpath. Contributing factors were the ineffective management and supervision of flight crew training and operations and inappropriate FAA surveillance of AVAir."<ref name=ASN/><ref name=AirDisaster.com/>
