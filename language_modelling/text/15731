'''K. Subrahmanyam''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:<U+0B95><U+0BCD><U+0BB0><U+0BBF><U+0BB7><U+0BCD><U+0BA3><U+0B9A><U+0BCD><U+0BB5><U+0BBE><U+0BAE><U+0BC0> <U+0B9A><U+0BC1><U+0BAA><U+0BCD><U+0BB0><U+0B95><U+0BCD><U+0BAE><U+0BA9><U+0BCD><U+0BAF><U+0BC1><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>, born 1929) is a prominent international [[strategic]] affairs analyst, [[journalist]] and former [[India]]n [[civil servant]]. He is the founding director of the New Delhi-based [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]]. Considered a proponent of ''[[Realpolitik]]'' Subrahmanyam is most often referred to as the doyen of [[India]]'s strategic affairs community,<ref>http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2515/stories/20080801251503300.htm</ref><ref name="autoref1">http://mod.nic.in/samachar/dec01-05/index.htm</ref> and, more contentiously, as the premier ideological champion of [[India]]'s [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[Nuclear deterrent|deterrent]].<ref>http://www.india-seminar.com/2007/569/569_bharat_karnad.htm</ref><ref>http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1618/16180210.htm</ref>

==Biography==

Subrahmanyam (born January 1929) grew up in [[Tiruchirapalli]] and [[Madras]]. Enrolling at [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]] he received an [[M.Sc.]] in [[Chemistry]] from [[Madras University]] and, after standing first in the  [[Civil Services Examination]], was appointed to the [[Indian Administrative Service]] in [[1951]]<ref>http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/AuthorSelect.asp?Author=K+Subrahmanyam</ref>. After service in the [[Tamil Nadu]] cadre and in the Defence Ministry, he was appointed a [[Rockefeller]] Fellow in Strategic Studies at the [[London School of Economics]] in [[1966]]. On returning to India he was appointed Director of the newly created [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses]] (IDSA) in New Delhi, a position he held until [[1975]]. He then went on to a number of senior [[Government of India|Indian government]] positions - including Chairman of [[India]]'s [[National Security Council (India)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] in [[New Delhi]]<ref>http://www.india-defence.com/reports-1611</ref>, Home Secretary for [[Tamil Nadu]] and Union Secretary for Defence Production in the Ministry of Defence<ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RAuT896J0HcC</ref> - before returning as Director of [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|IDSA]] in [[1980]]<ref>http://www.globalzero.org/en/who/k-subrahmanyam</ref>. He returned to [[England]] as a Visiting Professor and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] Fellow at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[Cambridge]] in [[1987]]<ref>http://www.indiaclub.com/Shop/AuthorSelect.asp?Author=K+Subrahmanyam</ref>. Between [[1974]] and [[1986]], Subrahmanyam also served on a number of [[United Nations]] and other multilateral study groups on issues such as [[Indian Ocean]] affairs, disarmament and [[nuclear deterrence]]; and also at various [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] conferences as a senior member. <ref> http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol2/v2_n1.php </ref>

Subrahmanyam is the author or co-author of fourteen books, including The Liberation War (1972) with Mohammed Ayoob about the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], [[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear]] Myths and Realities (1980), India and the [[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear]] Challenge (1986), The Second Cold War (1983)<ref>http://openlibrary.org/a/OL2663219A/K.-Subrahmanyam</ref> and Superpower Rivalry in the Indian Ocean (1989) with Selig S Harrison<ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=RAuT896J0HcC</ref>. 

He declined the [[Government of India|Indian government]] honour of a [[Padma Bhushan]] in [[1999]], stating that bureaucrats and journalists should not accept government awards.<ref> http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2714615.cms </ref>

Incidentally, Subrahmanyam was on board an [[Indian Airlines]] flight (IC 421) on 24 August [[1984]] when the plane was hijacked to [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]] and onward to [[Dubai]] where all passengers were released without incident. Interestingly, the arrested hijackers later claimed in court that it was Subrahmanyam who "planned the entire hijacking to examine [[Nuclear energy|nuclear]] installations in Pakistan."<ref>http://www.expressindia.com/news/ie/daily/20000109/ian09035.html</ref>

[[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|IDSA]] instituted an annual 'K Subrahmanyam Award' for contributions to Strategic Affairs in [[2007]].<ref>http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=711080649&cat=&n_date=20071108</ref>

Speaking on the 40th anniversary of [[Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|IDSA]]'s founding, on November 11, [[2005]], Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] singled out Subrahmanyam for his achievements. "Subrahmanyam's incisive writings continue to stimulate and contribute to the thinking of strategic analysis and policy makers in this vital area of national concern," he said. "We look forward to many more years of active contribution from this doyen of the strategic community in [[India]]."<ref name="autoref1" /><ref>http://news.indiainfo.com/2005/11/11/1111subhramanyam-award.html</ref>

A [[festschrift]] in honour of Subrahmanyam, with essays by [[India|Indian]] and [[United States|American]] policy experts, academics and journalists, was published in [[2004]] to mark his 75th birthday.<ref>http://www.financialexpress.com/news/vajpayee-opposed-nuclear-option-in-79/97729/</ref>

[[India Today]] magazine featured him in its annual 'High & Mighty' list in [[2006]]<ref>http://www.indiatoday.com/itoday/20060320/powerpeople10.html</ref>

He is the father of noted historian [[Sanjay Subrahmanyam]].

==Role in Indian Nuclear and Security Policy==

====Indian Nuclear Doctrine====
Subrahmanyam was appointed the Convenor of [[India]]'s first National Security Council Advisory Board (NSCAB), established by the [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]] government in [[1998]].<ref>http://www.asian-affairs.com/India/subrahmanyam.html</ref> The board drafted India's Draft [[Nuclear weapon|Nuclear]] Doctrine, which governs all policy aspects with regard to usage and deployment of India's [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] arsenal.<ref>http://www.pugwash.org/reports/nw/nw7.htm</ref> Its most significant aspect was the declared  [[No first use|''No First Use'']] policy, and the consequent directive that India's [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] weapons would largely be oriented around a [[second strike]] capability. Subrahmanyam had been an old proponent of India adopting a [[No first use|No First Use]] posture, even arguing for it right after the [[Pokhran-II|Shakti tests]] in 1998.<ref>http://www.fas.org/news/india/1998/05/980528-et.htm</ref> The [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] doctrine was adopted by the  [[Government of India|Indian government]] soon after.<ref>http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a794958278~db=all</ref>

===Kargil Review Committee and controversy===
Subrahmanyam was appointed Chairman of the [[Kargil War|Kargil]] Review Committee in [[1999]], an inquiry commission set up by the  [[Government of India|Indian government]] to analyze perceived [[India|Indian]] intelligence failures with the [[Kargil War]]. The committee's final report (also referred to as the 'Subrahmanyam Report'<ref> http://news.indiamart.com/news-analysis/kargil-subrahmanyam--6975.html</ref>) led to a large-scale restructuring of [[List of Indian Intelligence agencies|Indian Intelligence]].<ref>http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20000320/ied20064.html</ref> It, however, came in for heavy criticism in the [[India|Indian]] media for its perceived avoidance of assigning specific responsibility for failures over detecting the [[Kargil War|Kargil]] intrusions.<ref> http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XnzRttnqExUC Pg 56-60 Dixit, JN, "India-Pakistan in War & Peace", Routledge, 2002 </ref> The Committee was also embroiled in controversy for indicting [[Brigadier]] Surinder Singh of the [[Indian Army]] for his failure to report [[Pakistan Army|enemy]] intrusions in time, and for his subsequent conduct. Many press reports questioned or contradicted this finding and claimed that Singh had in fact issued early warnings that were ignored by senior [[Indian Army|Army]] commanders and, ultimately, higher [[Government of India|government]] functionaries.<ref>http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1813/18130410.htm </ref><ref> http://www.hindu.com/2001/07/01/stories/05011344.htm </ref><ref> http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/feb/16kargil.htm </ref>

In a departure from the norm the final report was published and made publicly available<ref> http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1722/17220240.htm </ref>. Some chapters and all annexures, however, were deemed to contain [[Classified information|classified information]] by the  [[Government of India|government]] and not released. Subrahmanyam later wrote that the annexures contained information on the development of [[India]]'s [[India and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]] and the roles played by  [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Ministers]] [[Rajiv Gandhi]], [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] and [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh|V P Singh]].<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041229/edit.htm#6</ref><ref>http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791915926~db=all</ref>

====Task Force on Strategic Developments====
In November [[2005]], [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] appointed Subrahmanyam to head a special  [[Government of India|government]] task force to study 'Global Strategic Developments' over the next decade.<ref>http://www.hindu.com/2005/11/05/stories/2005110502491300.htm</ref> The Task Force examined various aspects of global trends in strategic affairs and submitted its report to the  [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] in [[2006]]. <ref> http://www.asianage.com/presentation/columnisthome/inder-malhotra/china-a-long-view.aspx </ref><ref>http://news.indiainfo.com/2006/09/19/1909india-us-unique.html</ref> The report has not yet been released in the [[Public domain|public domain]].

==Influence on National Security and Defence Policy==

Subrahmanyam's pioneering policy work is generally accepted to have left a lasting, even if sometimes controversial, impression on [[India]]n strategic thinking and [[foreign policy]]. Its substance is still being debated, even as it is recognized to be firmly located in the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] and [[realpolitik]] traditions.<ref>http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/engaging-security-the-legacy-of-k-subrahmanyam/</ref><ref>http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/11inter.htm</ref> Many of his positions, especially on [[India]]'s [[Nuclear Weapon|nuclear]] choices, have often led to Subrahmanyam being dubbed a policy 'hawk' and 'hardliner'<ref>http://www.southasianmedia.net/Magazine/Journal/nuclearflashpoint.htm</ref>. 

====Indian Nuclear Program====
Subrahmanyam is mostly identified as the premier ideological champion of [[India]]'s [[Nuclear energy|nuclear]] program <ref>http://www.bu.edu/globalbeat/pubs/ib15.html</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sOTZqI5zREoC Cohen, Stephen P, The Idea of Pakistan, Brookings Institution Press, 2002 ISBN 0815715013, 9780815715016</ref><ref>http://www.ciaonet.org/casestudy/ber01/ber01.pdf</ref>and its exercising of the [[Nuclear weapon|weapons]] option - which began with [[India]]'s first 'peaceful' [[Smiling Buddha]] [[Nuclear explosion|nuclear]] test in [[1974]] and culminated with the [[1998]] '[[Pokhran-II|Shakti']] series of weapons tests, both in [[Pokhran|Pokhran, Rajasthan]].<ref>http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/india/nuke/index.html</ref><ref>http://www.littlemag.com/vox/nandy.html</ref> His polemics, articulated over five decades, on [[India]]'s development as a [[Nuclear energy|nuclear]] nation, with civilian and weapons capabilities, have proven both influential and contentious with supporters and detractors alike - of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] development and [[nuclear disarmament]]. <ref> http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1621/16211020.htm </ref> His strong views and trenchant criticism of the inherent inequalities of the global [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] regimes are widely known and referenced, as well as being heavily commented on.<ref> http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UDA9dUryS8EC Pg 285-286 Perkovich, George, "India's nuclear bomb: the impact on global proliferation", University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0520232100 </ref><ref>http://www.brookings.edu/articles/1998/1123india_cohen.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2008_06/Subrahmanyam</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=sOTZqI5zREoC Pg 180-181 Cohen, Stephen.P, Emerging Power India, Brookings Institution Press, 2002</ref>

The so-called 'Subrahmanyam Formula' was widely used, especially in the mid-60's and throughout the 70's, to support [[India]]'s entry into the [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] club, despite the country's non-violent [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] origins and [[Foreign relations of India|foreign policy]] roots in [[Nehruvian]] pacifism.<ref>http://www.asiaticsociety.org.bd/journals/Dec_2008/contents/Rashiduzzaman.htm#_edn2</ref>. This ingenious and apparently paradoxical stand has been adversely commented upon by many. <ref> http://www.bdsdf.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=26083&st=30 </ref><ref>https://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/56/India_Defense_Budget.pdf?sequence=1</ref>

In [[1979]], as Chairman of [[India]]'s [[National Security Council (India)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] Subrahmanyam authored a [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Cabinet]] note arguing for the resumption of India's [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] program, which had been shut down in [[1977]] by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Morarji Desai]]. The note was discussed and shot down in a [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Cabinet]] meeting by [[Morarji Desai]] and, ironically, '''[[Atal Behari Vajpayee]]''', then India's [[External Affairs Minister]]. <ref>http://www.financialexpress.com/news/vajpayee-opposed-nuclear-option-in-79/97729/</ref> [[Atal Behari Vajpayee|Vajpayee]] would go on to immediately authorize the [[Pokhran-II|'Shakti']] series of [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] weapons tests on assuming office as [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] in [[March]] [[1998]].<ref>http://books.google.co.in/books?id=UDA9dUryS8EC Pg 408-419 Perkovich, George, India's Nuclear Bomb: The Impact on Global Proliferation, University of California Press, 2002, ISBN 0520232100, 9780520232105</ref>

====1971 Indo-Pak War====
{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1971}}
Subrahmanyam's was also an influential voice that argued for [[India]]'s intervention in solving the serious [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|crisis]] in [[East Pakistan]] in early [[1971]]. His views, controversial at the time - being condemned even by then [[Indian Army|Army]] Chief [[Sam Manekshaw]] - swiftly gained ground and led to [[India]]'s examination of various [[military]] options. These culminated in India's [[December]] [[1971]] [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war with Pakistan]].<ref> Page 63-65, Ganguly, Sumit, "Conflict unending: India-Pakistan tensions since 1947", Columbia University Press, 2002, ISBN 0231123698 </ref>

Quite a bit his commentary on the [[Cold War]] politics that shadowed the entire [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]], and related prescriptions for [[India]]n policy, found its way into subsequent [[India]]n military doctrine.<ref>http://www.cprindia.org/papersupload/1215247694-Sidhu_Nuclear.pdf</ref>

====Indo-US Nuclear Deal====
{{main|Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement}}
In line with his ''[[Realpolitik]]'', Subrahmanyam -- once a well-known critic of the [[United States|US]] for its earlier [[Cold War]]-influenced foreign policy<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/18/world/in-clinton-india-sees-a-bridegroom.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all</ref><ref>http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/27c/519.html</ref><ref>http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/DA23Df02.html</ref><ref>http://www.fas.org/news/pakistan/1998/04/wwwhap10.html</ref>, even being dubbed a 'leftist' and 'Soviet sympathizer' on occasion <ref>http://in.rediff.com/news/2005/oct/11inter.htm</ref> -- has now been a leading advocate of the Indo-US [[Nuclear energy|Nuclear]] accord on civilian [[Nuclear energy|nuclear]] co-operation signed by [[President of the United States| President]] [[George W Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]] in [[2007]].<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/world/asia/10india.html</ref><ref>http://www.aerospaceindia.org/Journals/Monsoon%202005/Indo-US%20Relations%20in%20a%20Changing%20World.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/oct/13ndeal.htm</ref><ref>http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=6997</ref><ref>http://www.samachaar.in/Politics/Stalling_nuclear_deal_will_be_a_historical_mistake_23244/</ref> He might have also played some formal role in helping the deal along, as press reports indicated.<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/FullcoverageStoryPage.aspx?sectionName=NLetter&id=5ce0985d-ff2a-40fd-8fa6-7087f96aa057Nucleardealimbroglio_Special&Headline=Whose+interests+is+the+Left+protecting%3f</ref> He has often stated that there is now tremendous convergence of strategic interest between the two countries,<ref>http://pugwashindia.org/article_detail.asp?aid=61</ref> and that [[India]] should make use of a great opportunity to work with the [[US]]. Many [[India]]n and [[United States|American]] commentators have criticized this stand, and also the accord itself.<ref>http://www.hindu.com/2002/05/27/stories/2002052700031000.htm</ref>

====Criticism of government policy====
Subrahmanyam has long argued for revamping [[India]]'s national security decision-making apparatus, and has also been vociferous in his criticism of several [[Government of India|governments']] efforts at tinkering with the system.<ref>http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20001208/ina08035.html</ref><ref>http://indiaabroad.com/news/2005/jan/18spec1.htm</ref><ref>http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/oct/28karg.htm</ref> He has been particularly critical of successive [[Government of India|Indian governments']] lackadaisical approach to long-term strategic planning, and their similar attitudes to the creation of specialized positions and resources.<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060224/edit.htm</ref><ref>http://www.shashitharoor.com/books/reasons/reason-chapter.htm</ref>. One noted target of such criticism was his [[civil service]] batch mate [[Brijesh Mishra|Brajesh Mishra]], who served as both [[National Security Advisor (India)|National Security Advisor]] - when that post was created -  and Principal Secretary to [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Atal Behari Vajpayee]] from [[1998]] to [[2004]] <ref> http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/20001103/ina03038.html </ref>. Subrahmanyam repeatedly called for bifurcating both key posts, in commentary sometimes so strong that it even appeared to precipitate a public spat between the two.<ref>http://svaradarajan.blogspot.com/2004/05/brajesh-mishras-successor-as-nsa-cant.html</ref> This bifurcation of posts was finally done by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Manmohan Singh]], in consultation with Subrahmanyam <ref>http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/63652/</ref>, upon assuming office in [[2004]]. 

The establishment of a National Defence University by the [[Government of India|government]] is also something he has long demanded.<ref>http://mod.nic.in/pressreleases/content.asp?id=192</ref> Despite several recommendations, including those from a government committee Subrahmanyam himself chaired, this is yet to be set up.<ref>http://pmindia.nic.in/speech/content.asp?id=209</ref>

===Journalism===
Subrahmanyam is also well known as a frequent commentator and columnist in several [[India|Indian]] and international newspapers.<ref>Page xxiv, Chellaney, Brahma, "Securing India's future in the new millennium", Orient Blackswan, 1999 </ref><ref>http://in.reuters.com/article/specialEvents2/idINIndia-36769020081128</ref> After retiring from government service in the late 80's, he served as consulting editor and policy expert with various [[India|Indian]] publications. These include The Tribune, [[The Economic Times]] and [[The Times of India]].<ref>http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/8386.php</ref> Interestingly, Subrahmanyam was on the editorial board of [[The Times of India]] when [[India]] conducted the [[Pokhran-II|'Shakti']] [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] tests in [[1998]] and the largely [[centrist]] paper famously withheld his comments, temporarily, while it condemned the [[Nuclear weapon|weapons]] tests.<ref>http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080511/edit.htm#1</ref>
