'''Ethel Waters''' ([[October 31]], [[1896]] &ndash; [[September 1]], [[1977]]) was an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[blues]] vocalist and actress.  She was the second African American to ever be nominated for an [[Academy Award]].

Waters frequently performed [[jazz]], [[big band]], [[gospel]], and [[popular music]], on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage and in concerts. Her best-known recording was her version of the [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]] "[[His Eye is on the Sparrow]]".

==Early life==
Waters was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], to a thirteen-year-old mother who had been [[rape]]d. She was raised in a violent, impoverished [[Philadelphia]] [[ward (politics)|ward]]. Even though she was eventually adopted by her grandmother, she never lived in the same place for more than 15 months. She said of her difficult childhood, "I never was a child. I never was coddled, or liked, or understood by my family." Despite this unpromising start, Waters demonstrated early the love of language that so distinguishes her work. Moreover, according to her biographer [[Rosetta Reitz]], Waters' birth in the North and her peripatetic life exposed her to many cultures. She was a really well performer. For the rest of her life, this lent to her interpretation of southern blues a unique sensibility that pulled in eclectic influences from across American music.

Waters married at the age of 13, but soon left her abusive husband. She caught a break in 1917 when she sang in an amateur contest and was offered professional work in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. She later recalled that she earned the rich sum of ten dollars a week, but her managers cheated her out of the tips her admirers threw on the stage.

==Career==

She was very talented and had many achievements. Despite her early success, Waters fell on hard times and joined up with a carnival which traveled in freight cars to [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She enjoyed her time with the carnival, and recalled, "The roustabouts and the concessionaires were the kind of people I'd grown up with, rough, tough, full of larceny towards strangers, but sentimental, and loyal to their friends and co-workers." She did not last long with them, though, and soon headed south to [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. There, she worked in the same club with [[Bessie Smith]]. Smith demanded that she not compete in singing the blues opposite her, and Waters conceded to the older woman and instead sang ballads and popular songs and danced. Though perhaps best known for her blues singing today, Waters was to go on to star in musicals, plays and TV and return to the blues only periodically.

She fell in love with a drug addict in this early period, but their stormy relationship ended with [[World War I]]. She moved to [[Harlem]] and became part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] around 1919. 

Waters obtained her first job around at [[Edmond's Cellar]], a club that had a black patronage. She specialized in popular ballads, and became an actress in a [[blackface]] comedy called ''[[Hello 1919]]''.  Her biographer Rosetta Reitz points out that by the time Waters returned to Harlem in 1921, women blues singers were among the most powerful entertainers in the country, and that year Ethel became the fifth black woman to make a record. She later joined [[Black Swan Records]], where [[Fletcher Henderson]] was her accompanist. Waters later commented that Henderson tended to perform in a more classical style than she would prefer, often lacking "the damn-it-to-hell bass". According to Waters, she influenced Henderson to practice in a "real jazz" style. She first recorded for [[Columbia Records]] in [[1925]]; this recording was given a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in [[1998]]. Soon after, Waters started working with [[Pearl Wright]], and together they toured in the South. In 1924 Waters played at the [[Plantation Club]] on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]. She also toured with the [[Black Swan Dance Masters]]. With [[Earl Dancer]], she joined what was called the "white time" [[Keith Circuit]]. They received rave reviews in Chicago, and earned the unheard of salary of $1250 in 1928. In 1929, [[Harry Akst]] helped Pearl and Ethel compose a version of "[[Am I Blue?]]", her signature tune.

During the 1920s, Waters performed and/or was recorded with the ensembles of [[Will Marion Cook]] and [[Lovie Austin]]. As her career continued, she evolved toward being a [[blues]] and [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] singer performing with artists such as [[Duke Ellington]].

In 1933, Waters made a satirical all-black film entitled ''[[Rufus Jones for President]]''.  She went on to star at the Cotton Club, where, according to her autobiography, she "sang "[[Stormy Weather]]" from the depths of the private hell in which I was being crushed and suffocated."  She took a role in the Broadway musical revue ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' in 1933, where she was the first black woman in an otherwise white show. She had three gigs at this point; in addition to the show, she starred in a national radio program and continued to work in nightclubs. She was the highest paid performer on Broadway, but she was starting to age. [[MGM]] hired [[Lena Horne]] as the ingenue in the all-Black musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky]]'', and Waters starred as Petunia ([[1942 in film|1942]]), repeating her stage role of 1940. The film, directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], was a success, but Waters, offended by the adulation accorded Horne and feeling her age, went into something of a decline.

She began to work with [[Fletcher Henderson]] again in the late 1940s.  She was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in [[1949]] for the film ''[[Pinky (1949 film)|Pinky]]''. In [[1950]], she won the New York Drama Critics Award for her performance opposite [[Julie Harris]] in the play ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]''. Waters and Harris repeated their roles in the [[1952 in film|1952]] film version of ''[[Member of the Wedding]]''.

In [[1950]], Waters starred in the [[television series]] ''[[Beulah (series)|Beulah]]'' but quit after complaining that the scripts were portraying African-Americans as "degrading".  Despite these successes, her brilliant career was fading. She lost tens of thousands in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] hounded her. Her health suffered, and Waters worked only sporadically in following years.

Said her biographer Rosetta Reitz, Waters was a natural. Her "songs are enriching, nourishing. You will want to play them over and over again, idling in their warmth and swing. Though many of them are more than 50 years old, the music and the feeling are still there."

Waters died in [[1977]] at the age of 80 from  heart disease. She had been staying in a [[Chatsworth, California]] home of a young couple caring for her, and died at their home.
