[[Colonel-in-Chief]] [[Knight|Sir]] '''Nils Olav''' is a [[King Penguin]] living in [[Edinburgh Zoo]], [[Scotland]]. He is the [[mascot]] and Colonel-in-Chief of the Norwegian [[Hans Majestet Kongens Garde|King's Guard]].  Nils was visited by the Norwegian King's Guard on the 15 August 2008 and awarded a [[knighthood]].  The honour was approved by the king of Norway, [[King Harald V]].  During the ceremony a crowd of several hundred people joined the 130 guardsmen at the zoo to hear a citation from King Harald the Fifth of Norway read out, which described Nils as a penguin "in every way qualified to receive the honour and dignity of knighthood".<ref> {{cite web|title=Military penguin becomes a 'Sir'|publisher=BBC News Website|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7562773.stm|accessdate=2008-08-14}} </ref>

When the Norwegian King's Guard visited [[Edinburgh Military Tattoo]] of 1961 for a Drill Display,<ref>[http://www.edinburgh-tattoo.co.uk/programme/program_1961.html The Edinburgh Military Tattoo Programme 1961]</ref> a lieutenant called Nils Egelien became interested in Edinburgh Zoo's penguin colony. When the Guards once again returned to [[Edinburgh]] in 1972, he arranged for the unit to adopt a penguin. This penguin was named Nils Olav in honour of ''Nils'' Egelien, and [[King of Norway|King]] [[Olav V of Norway|''Olav'' V]] of Norway.

Nils Olav was given the [[Rank (military)|rank]] of [[Lance Corporal|visekorporal]] (lance corporal) and has been promoted each time the King's Guard has returned to the Tattoo. In 1982 he was made [[corporal]], and promoted to [[sergeant]] in 1987. Nils Olav died shortly after his promotion to sergeant, and his place of honour was taken by Nils Olav II, his two-year-old near-double. He was promoted in 1993 to the rank of [[regimental sergeant major]]. On August 18, 2005, he was promoted to Colonel-in-Chief<ref> [http://www.norway.org.uk/edinburgh/events/nopromotion.htm Website of the Norwegian Consulate in Edinburgh.]</ref> and on 15 August 2008 he was awarded a knighthood. He is the first penguin to receive such an honour in the [[Norwegian Army|Norwegian]] [[army]].<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/16/2337646.htm</ref> At the same time a four foot high [[bronze]] [[statue]] of Nils Olav was presented to [[Edinburgh Zoo]]. The statue's inscription recognises the King's Guard and the Military Tattoo. A statue also stands at the Royal Norwegian Guard compound at [[Huseby leir|Huseby]], [[Oslo]].

Norway presented the zoo with its first king penguin in 1913, the year of its opening.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7562773.stm</ref>

In Norway he is consistently referred to only as the ''[[mascot]]'' of the King's Guard {{Fact|date=August 2008}}, although both the plaque on his statue, and the website of the Norwegian Government's Consulate in Edinburgh, refer to his promotion to Colonel-in-Chief.
