'''Inchoate offences in English law''' are offences that cover illegal acts which have yet to be committed, primarily attempts to commit crimes, incitement to commit crimes, and conspiracy to commit crimes. Attempts, governed by the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]], are defined as situations where an individual who intends to commit an offence does an act which is "more than merely preparatory" in the offence's commission. Traditionally this definition has caused problems, with no firm rule on what constitutes a "more than merely preparatory" act, but broad judicial statements give some guidance. Incitement, on the other hand, is an offence under the [[common law]], and covers situations where an individual encourages another person to engage in activities which will result in a criminal act taking place, and intends for this act to occur. As a criminal activity, incitement has a particularly broad remit, covering "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity".<ref name=her793/>

Conspiracy is both a statutory and common law offence. In its statutory form, under the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], it consists of any agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence. Common law conspiracy, on the other hand, covers "conspiracy to defraud" and "conspiracy to corrupt public morals", although the latter has no substantive case law and is not seen as an offence that individuals are likely to be prosecuted for. All three inchoate offences require a ''[[mens rea]]'' of intent, and upon conviction, the defendant is sentenced as if they had succeeded in committing the attempted, incited or conspired crime in question.

==Definition==
Inchoate means "just begun" or "undeveloped", and is used in [[English criminal law]] to refer to situations where, although a substantial offence has not been committed, the defendant has taken steps to commit it, or encouraged others to do so.<ref>Herring (2008) p.771</ref> These situations are generally divided into three categories; attempts, where the defendant has taken steps "towards carrying out a complete crime", incitement, where the defendant has encouraged others to commit a crime, and conspiracy, where the defendant has agreed with others to commit a crime. In each case, the defendant "has not himself performed the ''[[actus reus]]'' but is sufficiently close to doing so, or persuading others to do so, for the law to find it appropriate to punish him".<ref>Herring (2008) p.772</ref>

==Offences==

===Attempt===
Attempts are governed by the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]], which states that "if, with intent to commit an offence to which [the act applies], a person does an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence, he is guilty of attempting to commit the offence".<ref>Criminal Attempts Act 1981 S.1(1)</ref> The first element is intent, or ''[[mens rea]]''. In ''[[R v Pearman]]'',<ref>(1984) 80 Cr App R 259 (CA)</ref> the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act is the same as the definition in the common law.<ref>Herring (2008) p.773</ref> The common law gives intention "its normal meaning: purpose or aim", with judges advised not to, in the majority of cases, attempt to complicate the definition.<ref>Herring (2008) p.139</ref> Conditional intent - where somebody has an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances - has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime. In ''[[Attorney-General's Reference (Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979)]]'', the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal "anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully".<ref name=her778>Herring (2008) p.778</ref> 

Section 1(1) also provides that the ''[[actus reus]]'' must be "more than merely preparatory". In practise, academic Jonathan Herring notes that "there is no hard and fast rule about when an act may be more than merely preparatory", although there are several cases which give broad guidance.<ref name=her778/> In ''[[R v Geddes]]'',<ref>[1996] Crim LR 894</ref> a man entered the toilets in a school in Brighton with a large knife, some rope and a roll of masking tape; it was alleged that he was intending to kidnap a pupil. The Court of Appeal confirmed that this was not enough for a conviction.<ref>Herring (2008) pp.779-80</ref> However, certain general rules have been laid down; if the defendant has committed the last act before completing his offence, it constitutes an attempt, as in ''[[R v Jones]]''.<ref>[1990] 1 WLR 1057 (CA)</ref> This is not, however, necessary in all situations, as in ''[[R v Gullefer]]''.<ref>[1990] 3 All ER 882 (CA)</ref> The ''actus reus'' of the full offence is also taken into account; in ''[[R v Toothill]]'',<ref>[1998] Crim LR 876 (CA)</ref> the defendant was charged with attempted burglary after trespassing into the victim's garden and knocking on their door. He was found guilty, because he had entered the property - the ''actus reus'' for burglary - and his actions were thus more than merely preparatory.<ref>Herring (2008) p.781</ref>

Certain things cannot be attempted. These include conspiracy, under Section 1(4) of the 1981 Act, assisting a criminal, under Section (4)1 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], aiding in the commission of an offence, or most summary offences, with the logic being that they are too minor for attempts to justify a criminal conviction.<ref>Herring (2008) p.782</ref> Some exceptions are also made for "impossible attempts", which are divided into legal impossibility, impossibility through ineptitude and physical impossibility. Cases of legal impossibility occur when the defendant attempts to do something which he believes to be illegal, which is in fact not; this does not constitute a crime. Impossibility through ineptitude is where the defendant attempts to commit a crime with inadequate means, in which case he can be found guilty. Physical impossibility covers situations where not only is the action inadequate, but impossible; Herring gives the example of "D [trying] to kill V who he thinks is asleep, but is in fact dead".<ref>Herring (2008) p.783</ref> Such actions are governed by Section 1(2) and 1(3) of the 1981 Act, which provides that they do constitute a crime if the actions, were the facts of the case to be as the defendant believed them to be, would have led to a valid attempt; as Herring states, "if the defendant believes he is dealing in illegal drugs he can be convicted of an attempted drug-dealing offence, even if in fact what he is selling is chalk".<ref>Herring (2008) p.784</ref>

If someone is found guilty of an attempt, they are sentenced under Section 4(1) of the 1981 Act. This provides that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will be punished with the same period in prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.<ref>Clarkson, Keating & Cunningham (2007) p.475</ref>

===Incitement===
The Court of Appeal considers incitement to consist of a situation in which a defendant "incites another to do or cause to be done an act or acts which, if done, will involve the commission of the offence or offences by the other; and he intends or believes that the other, if he acts as incited, shall or will do so with the fault required for the offence or offences". Unlike attempts, incitement is a common law offence.<ref>Herring (2008) p.788</ref>

Incitement has a particularly broad ''actus reus''; it has been interpreted to include "a suggestion, proposal, request, exhortation, gesture, argument, persuasion, inducement, goading or the arousal of cupidity".<ref name=her793/> While it must include an act of incitement, this can be both express and implied. In ''[[Invicta Plastics Ltd v Clare]]'',<ref>[1976] RTR 251 (DC)</ref> a company sold a device to detect [[Radar gun|radar traps]] used by the police; using such a device is illegal. While the company made clear that the device should not be used illegally, since its only possible purpose was illegal, they were found guilty. The case also confirmed that there is no need for the incitement to be aimed at a specific person - addressing it to the world at large still constitutes incitement.<ref name=her793>Herring (2008) p.793</ref> For an offence to be committed, the incited act must be criminal in nature, and an offence not only for the person doing the incitement but the person incited. Some exceptions are made; under Section 5(7) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], incitement to conspire is not an offence, and incitement to an attempt and incitement to aid in an offence are similarly not specifically given as criminal acts.<ref>Herring (2008) p.794</ref>

In terms of ''mens rea'', the defendant must have intended the incited offence to be committed, and also be aware of the likely consequences. Herring gives the example of D encouraging A to stab B in the arm. If B is stabbed and injured, D is guilty of incitement to wound, but the same is true if B is (unknown to D) a haemophiliac, and dies as a result of the injury.<ref>Herring (2008) p.794</ref> It has been suggested that intent should not be necessary; if the defendant knew that if his advice was followed, an offence would be committed, he should be found guilty, as "foresight of virtual certainty can amount to intention".<ref>Herring (2008) p.795</ref> Where a crime is impossible, incitement cannot be committed; the courts do distinguish two situations - where the crime is not possible at the time of the actions, but was at the time of the incitement, where it is possible to commit the crime but the methods are inadequate. In both of these cases, the defendant is guilty of incitement.<ref>Herring (2008) p.796</ref>

===Conspiracy===
Statutory conspiracy consists of an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under Section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act.<ref>Herring (2008) p.798</ref> For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements; an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where the parties to the agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the ''actus reus'' is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged.<ref>Herring (2008) p.799</ref> There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under Section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.<ref>Herring (2008) p.800</ref>

There is no need, under ''[[Churchill v Walton]]'',<ref>[1967] 2 AC 224</ref> to show that the conspirators knew that their proposed course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.<ref>Herring (2008) p.801</ref>

Common law conspiracies, on the other hand, fall into two categories; "conspiracy to defraud" and "conspiracy to corrupt public morals". The standard definition of a conspiracy to defraud was provided by [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Lord Dilhorne]] in ''[[Scott v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'',<ref>[1975] AC 910</ref> when he said that {{quote|it is clearly the law that an agreement by two or more by dishonesty to deprive a person of something which is his or to which he is or would be entitled and an agreemtn by two or more by dishonesty to injure some proprietary right of his, suffices to constitute the offence of conspiracy to defraud.<ref>Herring (2008) p.809</ref>}} Conspiracy to defraud therefore contains two key elements; that the conspiracy involved dishonesty, and that if the conspiracy was undertaken, the victim's property rights would be harmed. This does not require the defendants' actions to directly result in the fraud; in ''[[R v Hollinshead]]'',<ref>[1985] AC 975</ref> the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that producing devices designed to alter electricity meter readings constituted conspiracy to defraud, even though the actual fraud would be carried out by members of the public rather than the conspirators. In two situations, it will not even be necessary for the actions to directly lead to any kind of financial loss for the victim; these are when the conspirators plan to deceive a person holding public office into acting counter to their duties, and when the conspirators know that their actions put the victim's property at risk, even if the risk never materialises.<ref>Herring (2008) p.811</ref> Conspiracy to "corrupt public morals" has no definitive case law; it is unknown whether or not it is a substantive offence, and Herring sees it as unlikely that conspirators will be prosecuted for this offence.<ref>Herring (2008) p.812</ref>

==Theory==
The law related to criminal attempts is regularly discussed and debated, particularly in regards to its justification. As a general principle of the law, criminal liability is normally only imposed upon "a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm", and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy, it can be argued that there is no harm caused; attempted burglary, for example, does not lead to anything being stolen.<ref>Clarkson, Keating & Cunningham (2007) p.472</ref> There are two counterarguments to this. The first is that when a crime is attempted, there is a harm, namely a threat to security. Individuals have the right to security, both of themselves and their property, and an attempt to commit a crime infringes on this right. The second is that, regardless of the harm principle, criminal liability for attempts can be justified in [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] terms. A person who tries to commit a crime has shown themselves to be dangerous, and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others.<ref>Clarkson, Keating & Cunningham (2007) p.473</ref>

For conspiracy, the standard justification is the "group-danger" rationale, which states that since the objective of the criminal law is to protect harm to the community, and the community is at more risk from a group of people with harmful intentions than an individual with those same intentions, conspiracies themselves must be made a crime.<ref>Herring (2008) p.835</ref> The criminalisation of incitement is justified with the argument that incitement constitutes an attempt at conspiracy; the inciter's objective is to persuade others to engage in criminal acts, with his knowledge and cooperation, and as such is "more dangerous than a direct attempt, because it may give rise to that cooperation among criminals which is a special hazard".<ref>Clarkson, Keating & Cunningham (2007) p.535</ref>
