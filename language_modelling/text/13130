'''Customer relationship management''' ('''CRM''') is a model for managing a company<U+2019>s interactions with current and future [[customers]]. It provides a 360 degree view of customer data. It involves using technology to organize, automate, and synchronize [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[customer service]], and [[technical support]].<ref>[[Robert Shaw (Marketing)|Shaw, Robert]], Computer Aided Marketing & Selling (1991) Butterworth Heinemann ISBN 978-0-7506-1707-9</ref>

==Types/variations==

===Sales force automation===
[[Sales force automation]] (SFA) uses software to streamline the sales process. The core of SFA is a [[contact management system]] for tracking and recording every stage in the sales process for each prospective client, from initial contact to final disposition. Many SFA applications also include insights into opportunities, territories, sales forecasts and workflow automation.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Marketing===
CRM systems for marketing track and measure campaigns over multiple channels, such as email, search, social media, telephone and direct mail. These systems track clicks, responses, leads, deals.

===Customer service and support===
CRMs can be used to create, assign and manage requests made by customers, such as [[call center]] software which help direct customers to agents.<ref name=sap1>SAP Insider (15 November 2007) [http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/e044e180-8375-2a10-a2b2-b5709ea68ccb Still Struggling to Reduce Call Center Costs Without Losing Customers?]</ref> CRM software can also be used to identify and reward loyal customers.

===Appointments===
Appointment CRMs automatically provide suitable appointment times to customers via e-mail or the web, which are then synchronized with the representative or agent's calendar.{{citation needed|date= April 2012}}

===Analytics===
Sales analytics monitor client actions and preferences and augment sales forecasts and help measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. The simplest form involves tracking mouse clicks, but can also include [[predictive analytics]] which use <U+201C>buy signals<U+201D> to see which prospects are likely to transact {{citation needed|date= April 2012}}

===Small business===
For [[small business]]es a CRM may simply consist of a contact manager system which integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts.{{citation needed|date= April 2012}}

===Social media===
Some CRMs coordinate with [[social media]] sites like [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Facebook]] and [[Google Plus]] to track and communicate with customers who share opinions and experiences about their company, products and services.<ref name=dest2>DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Who-Owns-the-Social-Customer-54028.aspx Who Owns the Social Customer?]</ref>

===Non-profit and membership-based===
Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fund-raising, demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communications with individuals.

==Adoption Issues==

In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $1 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to ''CSO Insights'', less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.<ref name=dickie>Jim Dickie, ''CSO Insights'' (2006) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Reality-Check/Demystifying-CRM-Adoption-Rates-42496.aspx Demystifying CRM Adoption Rates]</ref> Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.<ref>Joachim, David. "CRM tools improve access, usability." (cover story). ''B to B'' 87, no. 3 (March 11, 2002): 1</ref>

In a 2007 survey from the [[UK]], four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. 43 percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing system.<ref name=sims>David Sims, TMC.net (2007) [http://blog.tmcnet.com/telecom-crm/2007/11/30/crm-adoption-biggest-problem-in-83-percent-of-cases-wigan-gets-crm-tre.asp CRM Adoption <U+2018>Biggest Problem<U+2019> in 83 Percent of Cases]</ref>

==Market Leaders==
The CRM market grew by 12.5 percent in 2008, from revenue of $8.13 billion in 2007 to $9.15 billion in 2008.<ref>DestinationCRM.com (2009) [http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/CRM-News/Daily-News/CRM-Market-Grows-for-Fifth-Straight-Year-55275.aspx CRM Market Grows for Fifth Straight Year]</ref> The following table lists the top vendors in 2006<U+2013>2008 (figures in millions of US dollars) published in [[Gartner]] studies.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=715308|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Customer Relationship Management Market Grew 23 Percent in 2007|accessdate=2008-08-15|date=2008-09-12 |publisher=Gartner, Inc }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1074615|title=Gartner Says Worldwide CRM Market Grew 12.5 Percent in 2008|accessdate=2009-10-27|date=2009-06-15 |publisher=Gartner, Inc }}</ref>

==Trends==
Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools ([[cloud computing]]) and [[software as a service]] (SaaS)). [[Salesforce.com]] was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.<ref>[http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/A-history-of-cloud-computing|title=A history of cloud computing] ''Computer Weekly'': March 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/193463/put_cloud_crm_to_work.html|title=Put Cloud CRM to Work] ''PC World'': April, 2010</ref> Traditional providers have recently moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] purchased [[RightNow]] in October 2011<ref>[http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/oracle-buys-cloud-based-customer-service-company-rightnow-for-1-5-billion/|title=Oracle Buys Cloud-based Customer Service Company RightNow For $1.5 Billion] ''Techcrunch'': October 24, 2011</ref> and [[SAP AG|SAP]] acquired [[SuccessFactors]] in December 2011.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-07/sap-challenges-oracle-with-3-4-billion-successfactors-purchase.html|title=SAP Challenges Oracle With $3.4 Billion SuccessFactors Purchase] ''Bloomberg Businessweek'': December 07, 2011</ref>

The era of the "social customer"<ref>{{cite book | year = 2009 | last = Greenberg | first = Paul | title = CRM at the Speed of Light | publisher = McGraw Hill | edition = 4th | page = 7}}</ref> refers to the use of social media ([[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], customer reviews in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc.) by customers. CRM philosophy and strategy has shifted to encompass social networks and user communities.

Another related development is [[vendor relationship management]], or VRM which provide tools and services for customers to independently manage their relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's [[Berkman Center for Internet & Society]] and [[Identity Commons]]' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of ''CRM'' Magazine.<ref>[http://www.destinationcrm.com/Issue/1776-May-2010.htm Destinationcrm.com] ''CRM Magazine'': May, 2010</ref>

In 2001 Doug Laney developed the concept and coined the term '[[Extended Relationship Management]]' ([[XRM]]).<ref>[http://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/02/ad1074-The-Great-Enterprise-Balancing-Act-Extended-Relationship-Management-XRM.pdf] ''The Great Enterprise Balancing Act: Extended Relationship Management (XRM)'', Doug Laney, META Group publication, December 10, 2001</ref> Laney defines XRM as extending CRM disciplines to secondary allies such as government, press, and industry consortia.

CRM futurist Dennison DeGregor describes a shift from 'push CRM' toward a 'customer transparency' (CT) model, due to the increased proliferation of channels, devices, and social media.<ref>{{cite book | year = 2011 | title = Customer-Transparent Enterprise: Beyond 20th Century CRM | first = Dennison | last = DeGregor | publisher = Motivational Press | isbn = 1-935723-23-5}}</ref>
