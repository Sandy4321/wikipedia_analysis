'''Hagia Sophia''', (the Church of) '''Holy Wisdom''', now known as the '''Ayasofya Museum''', is a former [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[church]] converted to a [[mosque]] in 1453 by the Turks, and converted into a [[museum]] in 1935. It is located in the [[Turkey|Turkish]] city of [[Istanbul]]. It is universally acknowledged as one of the greatest buildings of the world. Its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] at the [[fall of Constantinople]] is considered one of the great tragedies of [[Christianity]] by the [[Greek Orthodox]] faithful.

The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] name  {{Polytonic|<U+1F09><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03A3><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}, a contraction of {{Polytonic|''<U+039D><U+03B1><U+03CC><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+1F09><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+1FE6> <U+0398><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+1FE6> <U+03A3><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C2>''}}, meaning "Church of the [[Holy Wisdom|Holy Wisdom of God]]". It is also known as '''{{lang|la|Sancta Sophia}}''' in [[Latin]] and '''{{lang|tr|Ayasofya}}''' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Although it is sometimes called "Saint Sophia" in English, it is not named for a saint called Sophia - the Greek word ''sofia'' means "wisdom."

==Description==
Hagia Sophia is covered by a central [[dome]] with a diameter of 31 meters (102 feet) and 56 meters high, slightly smaller than the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]'s. The dome seems rendered weightless by the unbroken arcade of arched windows under it, which help flood the colorful interior with light. 

The dome is carried on [[pendentive]]s <U+2014> four concave triangular sections of masonry which solve the problem of setting the circular base of a dome on a rectangular base. At Hagia Sophia the weight of the dome passes through the pendentives to four massive piers at the corners. Between them the dome seems to float upon four great arches.

At the western (entrance) and eastern (liturgical) ends, the arched openings are extended by half domes carried on smaller semidomed [[exedra]]s. Thus a hierarchy of dome-headed elements builds up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the main dome, a sequence unexampled in antiquity. 
All interior surfaces are sheathed with polychrome marbles, green and white with purple [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and gold mosaics, encrusted upon the brick. On the exterior, simple stuccoed walls reveal the clarity of massed vaults and domes.

==Construction==
[[image:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of the original architecture of Hagia Sophia]]
Nothing remains of the first church that was built on the same site during the [[4th century]]. Following the destruction of the first church, a second was built by [[Constantius II]], the son of [[Constantine I]], but was burned down during the [[Nika riots]] of [[532]]. The building was rebuilt under the personal supervision of Emperor [[Justinian I]] and rededicated on [[December 27]], [[537]].   

Justinian chose [[Isidore of Miletus]] and [[Anthemius of Tralles]], a physicist and a mathematician, as architects; Anthemius, however, died within the first year. The construction is described in [[Procopius]]' ''On Buildings'' (De Aedificiis). The Byzantine poet [[Paulus the Silentiary]] composed an extant poetic ''[[ekphrasis]]'', probably for the rededication of [[563]], which followed the collapse of the main dome.   

Hagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of [[Byzantine architecture]]. Of great artistic value was its decorated interior with [[mosaics]] and [[marble]] pillars and coverings. The temple itself was so richly and artistically decorated that Justinian proclaimed "[[Solomon]], I have surpassed thee!" (''<U+039D><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03AC> <U+03C3><U+03B5> <U+03A3><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03CE><U+03BD>''). Justinian himself had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time, and it was to remain the largest cathedral for 1,000 years up until the completion of the [[Seville Cathedral|cathedral in Seville]].   

[[Image:Hagia-Sofia-Int-01s.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Interior of the Hagia Sophia, June 1994]] 
Justinian's basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of late [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the first masterpiece of Byzantine architecture. Its influence, both architecturally and liturgically, was widespread and enduring in the [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], and [[Muslim]] worlds alike. Under Justinian's orders, eight Corinthian columns were disassembled from [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]] and shipped to Constantinople for the construction of Hagia Sophia.<ref>[http://www.stoneworld.com/CDA/Archives/950726e9ee5f7010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ Baalbek keeps its secrets]</ref>

The dome of the Hagia Sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians and architects because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned the dome.  The dome is supported by [[pendentive]]s which had never been used before the building of this structure.  The pendentive enables the round dome to transition gracefully into the square shape of the piers below. The pendentives not only achieve a pleasing aesthetic quality, but they also restrain the lateral forces of the dome and allow the weight of the dome to flow downward.  

Although this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches, the actual construction of the walls of the Hagia Sophia weakened the overall structure.  The bricklayers used more mortar than brick, which, of course, constitutes a weak wall.  The structure would have been more stable if the builders at least let the mortar dry before they began the next layer, however, they did not do this.  When the dome was placed atop the building, the weight of the dome caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath.  When Isidorus the Younger rebuilt the original dome, he had to first build up the interior of the walls so that they were vertical in order to support the weight of the new dome.  Another probable change in the design of the dome when it was rebuilt was the actual height of the dome.  Isidorus the Younger raised the height of the dome by approximately twenty feet so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and the weight of the dome would flow more easily down the walls.  

A second interesting fact about the original structure of the dome was how the architects were able to place forty windows around the base of the dome.  The Hagia Sophia is famous for the mystical quality of light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the [[nave]], which gives the dome the appearance of hovering above the nave.  This design is possible because the dome is shaped like a scalloped shell or the inside of an umbrella with ribs that extend from the top of the dome down to the base.  These ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows, down the pendentives, and ultimately to the foundation. 

The anomalies in the design of the Hagia Sophia show how this structure is one of the most advanced and ambitious monuments of late antiquity.

==History==
Hagia Sophia was the seat of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople]] and a principal setting for Byzantine imperial ceremonies. 

The structure has been severely damaged several times by [[earthquakes]]. The dome collapsed after an earthquake in [[558]]; its replacement fell in [[563]]. There were additional partial collapses in [[989]] after which an [[Armenian people|Armenian]] architect named [[Tiridates|Trdat]] was commissioned to repair the damage. During the [[Latin Empire|Latin Occupation]] ([[1204]]-[[1261]]) the church became a [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral. After the Turks invaded Constantinople, Hagia Sophia was converted to a [[mosque]] in [[1453]]. In [[1935]], under the orders of [[Turkey|Turkish]] president [[Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]], Hagia Sophia was turned into the Ayasofya Museum.

For almost 500 years the principal mosque of Istanbul, Ayasofya served as model for many of the Ottoman mosques such as the [[Shehzade Mosque]], the [[Suleiman Mosque]], and the [[R<U+00FC>stem Pasha Mosque]]. 

Because [[Islam]] considers the depiction of the human form to be blasphemous, many mosaics were destroyed and others were covered with plaster. The Ottoman Sultans, however, periodically removed the plaster to service and maintain the mosaics, before replastering. Many restorations and repairs were done by Ottoman architects. The most famous and extensive work was done by [[Mimar Sinan]] in the 16th century, which included the addition of structural supports to the exterior of the building, the replacement of the old minarets with the minarets that stand today, and the addition of Islamic pulpits and art.

The 19th century restoration of the Fossati brothers, which included the addition of a pulpit ([[minbar]]) and the four medallions on the walls of the nave bearing the names of Muhammad and the first caliphs, destroyed many of the original mosaics.

==20th Century restoration==
[[Image:Aya Sophia Under Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The interior of the dome undergoing restoration.]]
Restoration work in the 20th century was begun in 1932 by the American Byzantine Institute, during which most of the figures were uncovered. 

Due to its long history as both a church and a mosque, a particular challenge arises in the restoration process. The Christian [[iconography|iconographic]] mosaics are being gradually uncovered.  However, in order to do so, important, historic Islamic art would have to be destroyed. Restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both Christian and Islamic cultures. In particular, much controversy rests upon whether the Islamic [[calligraphy]] on the dome of the cathedral should be removed, in order to permit the underlying [[Pantocrator]] mosaic of Christ as Master of the World, to be exhibited (assuming the mosaic still exists).

==Restoration controversies==
{{Unreferenced}}
Work has reportedly been purposely slow on the Hagia Sophia due to its important position and symbolism within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] of the Greek Orthodox Church has claimed that the Turkish Government has denied offers to provide monetary assistance for the further restoration of Hagia Sophia in order to downplay its importance. Some Orthodox and Catholic Christians have gone so far as to demand the return of Hagia Sophia to the Orthodox Christian religion as a condition of Turkey's entry into the [[European Union]].

In 2002 Reuters reported that many mosaics and icons stored in the basement of the cathedral had been damaged by moisture; this has caused some to question whether the Turkish authorities were capable of preserving the monument. It was further pointed out in 2005 that the scaffolding beneath the dome of the cathedral had been placed there since 1995 without restoration of the dome being completed, again giving rise to questions whether such restoration work was genuine.
