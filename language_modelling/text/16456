'''Colorado State Highway 257''' is a 18.478<!--isn't this level of precision a bit much?-->-mile long highway in [[Colorado]]'s [[Front Range]]. It is located entirely in [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]]. Its western end is at [[Colorado State Highway 60|SH 60]] and its eastern end is at [[Colorado State Highway 14|SH 14]].

==Route description==

The route begins at [[Colorado State Highway 60|SH 60]] in the western part of [[Milliken, Colorado|Milliken]], a town in central [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]]. It then heads northward, crosses the [[Big Thompson River]], a tributary of the [[South Platte River]] then enters [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]].

At Greeley, SH 257 has two [[interchange (road)|interchanges]]<!--each, or total?--> with [[U.S. Route 34 in Colorado|US 34]]<ref name="dotint">{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.state.co.us/app_dtd_dataaccess/Highways/index.cfm?fuseaction=Interchange&route=257&begRefPt=0&endRefPt=500&Printable=true|title=Interchange Information for Highway 257|author=Colorado Department of Transportation|accessdate=040-05-2010}}</ref> and [[U.S. Route 34 Business (Greeley, Colorado)|US 34 Business]]. Because the intersection is so close to the terminus of Business Route 34, the two interchanges are just 0.3 miles apart.<ref name="cdotinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/north-i-25-eis/documents/brt_cr_cb_tech_memos/sh_257_deis_brt_10-10-07.pdf|title=US 34 and SH 257 BRT Station DEIS Evaluation|author=Colorado Department of Transportation|accessdate=04-05-2010}}</ref> Both are [[diamond interchange]]s, but at US 34 there are only entrance ramps from the east side.<ref name="cdotinfo"/>

[[Image:DSCN9679 lakewindsor e.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The snow-capped peaks of the [[Front Range]].  Also visible is a bike path near SH 257 in Windsor.]]
It then heads northward, and begins to curve northwest<ref name="USmap">{{cite map |publisher= National Geographic|title=The United States|date= October 2006|accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> over the [[Cache la Poudre River]] and into [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]]. It intersects [[Colorado State Highway 392]] and abruptly turns west, beginning a concurrency at Main Street; about a mile later SH 257 abruptly turns back northward at 7th Street, ending the concurrency. It then heads all the way north to [[Colorado State Highway 14]], where it terminates. No towns exist on the route from Windsor to SH 14.

==History==
The route was established in 1939 with several differences. The route went north to [[Windsor, Colorado|Windsor]] from [[Milliken, Colorado|Milliken]], then turning west to SH 185. SH 185 was then deleted and replaced with [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate 25]], and SH 257 was readjusted so that it went north to SH 14. The route was paved by 1954. A spur south of [[Johnstown, Colorado|Johnstown]] was eliminated a year later. The interchanges at [[U.S. Route 34 in Colorado|US 34]] and [[U.S. Route 34 Business (Greeley, Colorado)|BR 34]] were built in 1998.<ref name="mesalek">{{cite web|url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/r234-266.html#257|title=Colorado Routes 234-266|author=Salek, Matthew E.|date=01-30-10|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

In November 2009, a new traffic signal was installed at the intersection with Garden Drive in Windsor. The construction cost about $350,000.<ref name="cdot">{{cite web|url=http://www.coloradodot.info/projects/arraprojectfiles/sh257windsor|title=State Highway 257 at Garden Drive in Windsor - CDOT|author=Colorado Department of Transportation|accessdate=04-05-2010}}</ref>

==Future==

Because of congestion around the US 34 and BR 34 interchanges, a [[bus rapid transit]] system has been planned to be built in Greeley.<ref name="cdotinfo"/>

==Major intersections==
The entire route is located in [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]], [[Colorado]].
