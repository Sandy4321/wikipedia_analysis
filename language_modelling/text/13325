'''Camille Maurane''' (born ''Camille Moreau'' [[November 29]], [[1911]]) is a [[France|French]] [[baritone]] singer. His father was a music teacher and he started singing as a child in the Ma<U+00EE>trise Saint-Evode in [[Rouen]].

He studied in the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]] in the class of [[Claire Croiza]] ([[1936]]-[[1939]]). He began his professional career as a singer in [[1940]] at the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique]] in [[Paris]]. His voice is typical of the [[baryton-martin]] range (between [[baritone]] and [[tenor]]). He is famous for his interpretations of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s Pell<U+00E9>as (he recorded 3 versions of [[Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande (opera)|Pell<U+00E9>as et M<U+00E9>lisande]]). He is also regarded as one of the best interpreters of m<U+00E9>lodies fran<U+00E7>aises and of [[Faur<U+00E9>]]'s ''Requiem''. He was one of the first to record [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]]'s [[baroque]] music.

A dedicated teacher, he taught at the Paris Conservatory until [[1981]].
