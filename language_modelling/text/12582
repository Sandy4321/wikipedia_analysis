'''''Frankenstein, MD''''' is a 2014 American [[Gothic horror]] comedy webseries with [[transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] elements. Produced in partnership between Pemberley Digital and [[PBS Digital Studios]], the show is a modern adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]], replacing the eponymous character with Victoria Frankenstein, a medical student near graduation. The show, which represents PBS Digital's first foray into scripted content, was created by Bernie Su and premiered on YouTube on August 19, 2014. It has been generally well received by critics, with its season finale occurring on October 31, 2014.

==Synopsis==
''Frankenstein, MD'' is presented as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with cutting-edge medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves as an adviser to Frankenstein, usually acting as a foil and reminding her of the impracticality or perceived impossibility of her experiments and theories.

Partway through the series, the show's unseen camera operator and editor, Robert Walton, dies from a fall while adventuring in Alaska, where his body is left partially preserved in the snow. Frankenstein becomes distraught and attempts to revive Walton's corpse with DeLacey's help in secret using the medical technologies she had expounded upon earlier in the show. The attempt is successful, but the revived creature is [[photophobia|startled by light]] and escapes the lab, running into the woods. Later, as Frankenstein and Lavenza are trying to locate the creature from her father's basement, Clerval is killed mysteriously while camping. The creature confronts Frankenstein and asks her to make him a friend. She grows morally opposed to the idea of recreating her experiment and agrees to run off to Costa Rica with Lavenza after he confesses his love to her. The creature returns to her makeshift lab and kills Lavenza in anger after he tries to stop it from hurting Frankenstein.

==Production==
''Frankenstein, MD'' was announced in May 2014, in a partnership between [[PBS Digital Studios]], the online arm of the American [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), and [[Pemberley Digital]] whose previous webseries included ''[[The Lizzie Bennet Diaries]]'' (an adaptation of [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'') and ''[[Emma Approved]]'' (based on Austen's ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'').<ref name="next up wsj">{{cite news|last1=Shields|first1=Mike|title=Next Up From PBS: Dr Victoria Frankenstein For YouTube Crowd|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/05/05/next-up-from-pbs-dr-victoria-frankenstein-for-youtube-crowd/|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 5, 2014}}</ref> The show is a [[Transmedia storytelling|transmedia]] adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]] that reimagines the story's male protagonist [[Victor Frankenstein]] as a female student of medicine named Victoria Frankenstein.<ref name="dd announcement">{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Aja|title='Lizzie Bennet' creators join PBS for modern genderbent 'Frankenstein'|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/pemberley-digital-pbs-frankenstein-modern-genderswap-series/|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=May 7, 2014}}</ref> The show is PBS Digital's first scripted program,<ref name="next up wsj" /> though it also includes educational elements.<ref name=newcomer>{{cite news|last1=Votta|first1=Rae|title='Frankenstein, M.D.' to star newcomer Anna Lore|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/frankenstein-md-anna-lore/|accessdate=September 5, 2014|work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=July 23, 2014}}</ref>

According to its writers, ''Frankenstein, MD''{{'}}s narrative fills a two-year gap left by Shelley's source text between Victor Frankenstein's time at medical school and his reappearance as a [[mad scientist]]. The original Frankenstein is driven to insanity by his ostracization and ''Frankenstein, MD'' attempted to recontextualize this concept by gender-swapping its lead.<ref name=backstage>{{cite news|last1=Strassberg|first1=Rebecca|title=Pemberley Digital<U+2019>s <U+2018>Frankenstein, M.D.<U+2019> Revives the Classic Monster|url=http://www.backstage.com/interview/pemberley-digitals-frankenstein-md-revives-classic-monster/|accessdate=November 13, 2014|work=[[Back Stage|Backstage]]|date=September 15, 2014}}</ref> Victoria Frankenstein is a medical student and later doctor grappling with institutional sexism in what the creators called the "sort of a male-dominated profession"<ref name=backstage /> of medicine.<ref name="dd announcement" />

==Reception==
Reviewing the first three episodes of the show for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Myles McNutt felt that the fact that the show was a coproduction of PBS and Pemberley Digital was "the most exciting part" but that it was also the element "that takes the most time to negotiate in the series<U+2019> first three episodes, as the writers and the audience alike adjust to the distinct goals of the science fiction vlog webseries."<ref name=avclub1>{{cite news|last1=McNutt|first1=Myles|title=''Frankenstein M.D.''|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/frankenstein-md-208296|accessdate=September 2, 2014|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=August 19, 2014}}</ref> McNutt declared the first three episodes "a solid start" and rated them B+, B, and A-, respectively.<ref name=avclub1 />  Nicole Vranjican wrote in ''[[The New York Observer]]'' that the show "has a definite juvenile feel and is likely best suited for scientifically curious Jr. High students" and that its message "that being smart is cool...sets a standard for television that more TV shows should get behind".<ref name=nyo /> After viewing the first six episodes, Atiya Abbas noted in ''Vox Magazine'' that "[t]he series is light-hearted compared to the dark subject of the novel".<ref name=missourian /> On ''Hypable'', Marama Whyte called the show "highly comedic" and noted its high production value and Anna Lore's "standout performance" as positive aspects.<ref name=hypable>{{cite news|last1=Whyte|first1=Marama|title=<U+2018>Frankenstein M.D.<U+2019> to premiere August 19, cast announced|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/07/23/frankenstein-md-cast-synopsis-announced/|accessdate=November 13, 2014|work=Hypable|date=July 23, 2014}}</ref>
