<!--NB<U+2014>THE DATES IN THIS ARTICLE ARE NON-AUTOFORMATTED-->'''Greater Manchester''' is a [[metropolitan county]] in [[North West England|North West]] [[England]], with a population of [[List of ceremonial counties of England by population|2.55&nbsp;million]].<ref name=population/> It encompasses one of the largest [[metropolitan area]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] and comprises ten [[metropolitan borough]]s: [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[City of Salford|Salford]] and [[Manchester]]. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]].<ref name=LGFSE16/>

Greater Manchester is landlocked and borders [[Cheshire]] (to the south-west and south), [[Derbyshire]] (to the south-east), [[West Yorkshire]] (to the north-east), [[Lancashire]] (to the north) and [[Merseyside]] (to the west). The [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] is the [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|third most populous conurbation in the UK]], and spans across most of the county's territory. As a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], Greater Manchester has a [[Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester|Lord Lieutenant]] and a [[High Sheriff of Greater Manchester|High Sheriff]].

[[Greater Manchester County Council]] was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively [[unitary authority|unitary authority areas]]; however, the metropolitan county, which is some {{convert|496|sqmi|km2|0|lk=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stockport.gov.uk/content/advicebenefitsemergencies/emergencyservices/gmfire/?a=5441|title=Greater Manchester Fire Service|publisher=stockport.gov.uk|author=Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008.</ref> continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference.<ref name="geographic frame of reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/ons_geography/Gazetteer_v3.pdf|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|title=Gazetteer of the old and new geographies of the United Kingdom|page48|format=PDF|publisher=statistics.gov.uk}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008.<br /><U+2022>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/metropolitan.asp |title=Beginners' Guide to UK Geography: Metropolitan Counties and Districts|author=[[Office for National Statistics]]|publisher=statistics.gov.uk|date=17&nbsp;September 2004}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008.<br /><U+2022>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/boundary-reviews/all-reviews/north-west|title=North West&nbsp;<U+2013> Electoral Commission|publisher=The Electoral Commission}} Retrieved on 7&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> Several county-wide services are co-ordinated through the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]].

==History==
{{Seealso|History of Manchester}}

===Origins===
Although the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974. the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. There is evidence of [[Iron Age]] inhabitation, particularly at [[Mellor, Greater Manchester|Mellor]],<ref name="Mellor hill fort">Nevell and Redhead (2005), p.&nbsp;20.</ref> and [[Celtic people|Celtic activity]] in a settlement named [[Chochion]], believed to have been an area of [[Wigan]] settled by the [[Brigantes]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman Wigan |url=http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/how.html#Roman |author=Adrian Morris |publisher=Wigan Archaeological Society}} Retrieved on 10&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> [[Stretford]] was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the [[Cornovii (Midlands)|Cornovii]] on the southern side of the [[River Mersey]].<ref>Bayliss (1996), p.&nbsp;6.</ref> The remains of 1st-century [[castra|forts]] at [[Castlefield]] in Manchester,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mamucium Roman fort |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=76731 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> and [[Castleshaw Roman fort]] in [[Saddleworth]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Castle Shaw |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=45891 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> are evidence of [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]]. Much of the region was omitted from the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.<ref>Redhead, Norman, in: Hartwell, Hyde and Pevsner (2004), p.&nbsp;18.</ref>
[[Image:Weavers' cottages, Wardle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Former [[weavers' cottage]]s in [[Wardle, Greater Manchester|Wardle]]. The development of Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of [[domestic system|domestic]] cloth production, and  [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]].]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salfordshire]]&nbsp;<U+2013> an ancient division of the county of [[Lancashire]]. Salfordshire encompassed several [[parish]]es and [[Township (England)|townships]], some of which, like [[Rochdale]], were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of [[domestic system|domestic]] [[flannel]] and [[fustian]] cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade.<ref name="FrangopuloPix">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;ix.</ref><ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;24<U+2013>25.</ref><ref name="M&N">McNeil and Nevell (2000), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>3.</ref> The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed the local domestic system, and much of Greater Manchester's heritage is related to [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] and the infrastructure that grew up to support this sector.<ref name="M&N"/> The townships in and around Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned [[urbanisation]] brought on by a boom in textile processing.<ref name="Cotton">Aspin (1981), p.&nbsp;3.</ref> Places such as [[Bury]], [[Oldham]] and [[Bolton]] played a central economic role in the nation, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive [[mill town]]s in the world.<ref>Cowhig (1976), pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>9.</ref> Due to its commercial and socioeconomic success, the need for local government and geo-administrative change in what is now Greater Manchester was proposed as early as the 1910s.<ref name="FrangopuloP226">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;226.</ref>

By the 18th century, traders from Germany had coined the name ''Manchesterthum'', meaning "Greater Manchester", and were using that as a name for the region in and around Manchester.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;268.</ref> However, the English term "Greater Manchester" did not appear until the start of the 20th century. One of its first known recorded uses was in a 1914 report put forward in response to what was considered to have been the successful creation of the [[County of London]] in 1889. The report suggested that a county should be set up to recognise the "Manchester known in commerce", and referred to the areas that formed "a substantial part of South-Lancashire and part of Cheshire, comprising all municipal boroughs and minor authorities within a radius of eight or nine miles of Manchester".<ref name="FrangopuloP226"/><ref>Swarbrick, J., (February 1914), ''Greater Manchester: The Future Municipal Government of Large Cities'', pp.&nbsp;12<U+2013>15.</ref> In his 1915 book ''Cities In Evolution'', innovative [[urban planning|urban planner]] [[Patrick Geddes|Sir Patrick Geddes]] wrote "far more than Lancashire realises, is growing up another Greater London".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;229.</ref>
[[Image:Greater Manchester (ancient).png|thumb|right|Greater Manchester lies at the conjunction of the [[Historic counties of England|ancient county boundaries]] of [[Cheshire]], [[Lancashire]] and the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].]]
[[Conurbation]]s in England tend to build-up at the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]]<ref>{{cite book | title= The reorganisation of British local government: old orthodoxies and a political perspective | author= Dearlove, John | year= 1979 | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= Cambridge | isbn= 0-521-29456-8 }}</ref> and Greater Manchester is no exception. Most of Greater Manchester lay within the ancient county boundaries of [[Lancashire]]; those areas south of the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] were in [[Cheshire]]. The [[Saddleworth]] area and a small part of [[Mossley]] are historically part of [[Yorkshire]] and in the south-east a small part in [[Derbyshire]]. The areas that were incorporated into Greater Manchester in 1974 previously formed parts of the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative counties]] of Cheshire, Lancashire, the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] and of eight independent [[county borough]]s.<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/>

The ''[[Manchester Evening News|Manchester Evening Chronicle]]'' brought to the fore the issue of "regional unity" for the area in April 1935 under the headline "Greater Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the "increasing demands for the exploration of the possibilities of a greater merger of [[public services]] throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities".<ref name="FrangopuloP227">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;227.</ref> The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and [[Salford]]. The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward to the day when "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester."<ref name="FrangopuloP227"/> Proposals were halted by the [[World War II|Second World War]], though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened.<ref name="FrangopuloP228">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;228.</ref> In 1947, [[Lancashire County Council]] proposed a three "[[Riding (division)|riding]]s" system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts.<ref name="FrangopuloP228"/> Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected regional body. In 1951, the [[census in the United Kingdom|census in the UK]] began reporting on South-East Lancashire as a homogonous conurbation.<ref name="FrangopuloP228"/>

===Redcliffe-Maud Report===
{{further|[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]]}}
The [[Local Government Act 1958]] designated the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area. The [[Local Government Commission for England (1958<U+2013>1967)|Local Government Commission for England]] presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county based on the conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The review was abolished in favour of the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report|Royal Commission on Local Government]] before issuing a final report.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;231.</ref>

The Royal Commission's 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering [[Urban district|urban]] and [[rural district]]s separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative [[metropolitan area]].<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;234.</ref> The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included [[Rossendale]]), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including [[Macclesfield]], [[Warrington]], [[Alderley Edge]], [[Northwich]], [[Middlewich]], [[Wilmslow]] and [[Lymm]]), and Derbyshire (the towns of [[New Mills]], [[Whaley Bridge]], [[Glossop]] and [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a minority report suggested that [[Buxton]] be included).<ref name="Redcliffe"/> The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside.<ref name="Redcliffe"/> The report noted "The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;233.</ref> Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] intended to define the "South-East Lancashire conurbation" noted that "Greater Manchester it is not [...] One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns, [...] all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance".<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;264.</ref> The term ''Selnec'' (or ''SELNEC'') was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as "the most convenient term available", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.<ref name="Redcliffe">Redcliffe-Maud ''et al'' (June 1969), pp.&nbsp;219<U+2013>235.</ref>
Following the [[Transport Act 1968]], in 1969 the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive]] (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and [[Saddleworth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It excluded Wigan, which was in both the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selnec.org.uk/selnec.htm|publisher=selnec.org.uk|author=The SELNEC Preservation Society|title=The Formation of the SELNEC PTE}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;July 2008.</ref>

Redcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled Government in February 1970.<ref name="Redcliffe2"> Redcliffe-Maud and Wood (1975), pp.&nbsp;46<U+2013>7, 56, 157.</ref>  Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Warrington, Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their [[county council]]s had enough revenue to remain competitive ([[Cheshire County Council]] would have ceased to exist).<ref name="Redcliffe2"/> Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]]. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed "Botchdale" by local MP [[Michael Fidler]])<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|date=6 July&nbsp; 1972|column_start=763|column_end=834}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lancashire saved from 'Botchdale'|work=[[The Times]]|date=7&nbsp;July 1972}}</ref> but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] from Oldham.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philosophy on councils has yet to emerge|work=[[The Times]]|date=8&nbsp;July 1972}}</ref>  During the passage of the bill, the towns of [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]], Wilmslow, [[Poynton]] and [[Hale, Halton|Hale]] successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county.<ref name= "Redcliffe2"/>

===After 1974===

The [[Local Government Act 1972]] reformed [[local government in England]] by creating a system of two-tier [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]] and [[Districts of England|district]]s throughout the country.<ref name=lga1972>HMSO. [[Local Government Act 1972]]. 1972 c.70</ref>  The act formally established Greater Manchester on 1&nbsp;April 1974, although [[Greater Manchester County Council]] had been running since [[United Kingdom local elections, 1973|elections in 1973]].<ref name="1973 Elections">{{Cite web|url=http://ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/collection.htm?uri=hist-5319-1|title=British Local Election Database, 1889-2003|publisher=AHDS&nbsp;<U+2013> Arts and Humanities data service|date=28&nbsp;June 2006}} retrieved on 5&nbsp;March 2008.</ref> The leading article in ''[[The Times]]'' on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the "new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively".<ref>{{cite news|title=All change in local affairs|work=[[The Times]]|date=1&nbsp;April 1974}}</ref> Frangopulo noted that with the creation of the Greater Manchester "was the official unifying of a region which, through history and tradition, had forged for itself over many centuries bonds [...] between the communities of town and village, each of which was the embodiment of the character of this region".<ref name="FrangopuloPxii">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;xii.</ref>

By January 1974, a joint working party representing Greater Manchester had drawn up its county ''Structure Plan'', ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out strategic and long-term objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;246.</ref> The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by way of improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in the county's country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure and recreational facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and journey to work patterns.<ref>Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;246<U+2013>255.</ref> The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]]) was a converted former railway station in Manchester City Centre used for cultural events.<ref>Parkinson-Bailey (2000), pp.&nbsp;214<U+2013>5.</ref>

Unlike most other modern counties (including [[Merseyside]] and [[Tyne and Wear]]), Greater Manchester was never adopted as a [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] by the [[Royal Mail]].

Greater Manchester is a landlocked county spanning [[List of ceremonial counties of England by area|492.7&nbsp;square miles (1,276&nbsp;km<U+00B2>)]]. The [[Pennines]] rise along the eastern side of the county, through parts of [[Oldham]], [[Rochdale]] and [[Tameside]]. The [[West Pennine Moors]], as well as a number of coalfields (mainly sandstones and shales) lie in the west of the county. The rivers [[River Mersey|Mersey]] and [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] run through the county boundaries, both of which rise in the Pennines. Other rivers run through the county, including the [[River Beal|Beal]], the [[River Douglas|Douglas]] and the [[River Irk|Irk]]. [[Black Chew Head]] is the [[List of English counties by highest point|highest point]] of Greater Manchester, rising {{convert|542|m|ft|0}} above sea-level, within the parish of [[Saddleworth]].<ref>Dawson (1992), Chapter 6: The County Tops.</ref> [[Chat Moss]] at {{convert|10.6|sqmi|km2|0}} comprises the largest area of prime farmland in Greater Manchester and contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/living/planning/naturalenvironment/landscape/chatmoss.htm|title=Chat Moss|author=Salford City Council|publisher=salford.gov.uk|date=2007}} Retrieved on 13&nbsp;November 2007.<br/><U+2022>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/farm/environment/land-use/pdf/alcleaflet.pdf|title=Agricultural Land Classification|format=PDF|date=July 2003|publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]}} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;July 2008.</ref>

The [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] is an area of land defined by the [[Office for National Statistics]] consisting of the large conurbation surrounding and including the City of Manchester. Its territory spans much, but not all of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. It excludes settlements such as [[Wigan]] and [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]] from the Greater Manchester county boundaries (Wigan itself forming the [[Wigan Urban Area]]), but includes some settlements which are outside of the county boundaries, such as [[Wilmslow]] and [[Alderley Edge]] in [[Cheshire]], and [[Whitworth, Lancashire|Whitworth]] in [[Lancashire]]. Although neither the Greater Manchester county, nor the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]] have been granted [[city status in the United Kingdom]], [[European Union]] literature suggests that the conurbation surrounding Manchester constitutes a homogonous urban [[city region]].<ref> [http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/localgovernment/strongprosperous State of the English Cities: Volume 1] Produced for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, (2006).

===Climate===

Greater Manchester experiences a temperate [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], like most of the [[British Isles]], with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The county's average annual rainfall is {{convert|806.6|mm|in|2}}<ref name="Greater Manchester weather">{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/manchester_airport.html|title=Manchester Airport 1971<U+2013>2000 weather averages |publisher=[[Met Office]]|year=2001}} Retrieved on 15&nbsp;July 2007.</ref> compared to the UK average of {{convert|1125.0|mm|in|2}},<ref name="UK weather">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html|title=UK 1971<U+2013>2000 averages|publisher=[[Met Office]]|year=2001}} Retrieved on 15&nbsp;July 2007.</ref> and its mean rain days are 140.4 per annum,<ref name="Greater Manchester weather"/> compared to the UK average of 154.4.<ref name="UK weather"/> The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom.<ref name="Climate01">{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html |author=Met Office |title=Annual UK weather averages |publisher=Met Office |date=2007}} Retrieved on 23&nbsp;April 2007.</ref> Greater Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place around the county. Snowfall is not a common sight in the built up areas, due to the [[Urban climate|urban warming]] effect. However, the [[Pennine]] and [[Rossendale Forest]] hills around the eastern and northern edges of the county receive more snow, and roads leading out of the county can be closed due to heavy snowfall,<ref name="Snow">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/147/147321_roads_chaos_as_snow_sweeps_in.html|title=Roads chaos as snow sweeps in Manchester|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|year=2005}} Retrieved on 15&nbsp;July 2007.</ref> notably the [[A62 road]] via [[Standedge]], the [[A57 road|A57]] ([[Snake Pass]]) towards [[Sheffield]],<ref name="Peaks">{{cite web|url=http://www.highpeak.co.uk/hp/h_snakbd.htm|title=Peak District sightseer's guide&nbsp;<U+2013> Snake Pass|publisher=High Peak|year=2002}} Retrieved on 6&nbsp;July 2007.</ref> and the [[M62 motorway|M62]] over [[Saddleworth Moor]].

Greater Manchester is divided into 28&nbsp;[[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] <U+2013> 18&nbsp;[[borough constituencies]] and 10&nbsp;[[county constituencies]]. Most of Greater Manchester is controlled by the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]], and is generally considered a Labour stronghold,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/119/119942_lib_dems_close_in_on_manchester.html |title=Lib Dems close in on Manchester|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=11&nbsp;June 2004}} Retrieved on 26&nbsp;February 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/manchester/feature/2009/4/Labour_party_returns_to_Manchester.html#articleAfterMpu |title=Labour party returns to Manchester|publisher=timeout.com|date=2006}} Retrieved on 26&nbsp;February 2008.</ref> with only four constituencies (since the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]]) belonging to the [[Liberal Democrats]], and one constituency to the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]]. [[Local government in England|Local governance]] in Greater Manchester is currently provided by the councils of ten [[Districts of England|districts]], known as [[metropolitan borough]]s, these are: [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], the [[Manchester|City of Manchester]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], the [[City of Salford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]].

Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester are named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence.<ref name="FrangopuloP138">Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;138.</ref> As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of [[Stockport]], a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], [[Gatley]], and [[Bramhall]].<ref name="FrangopuloP138"/> The names of two of the metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name because, at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a [[county borough]]. These boroughs are [[Tameside]] and [[Trafford]], centred on [[Ashton-under-Lyne]] and [[Stretford]], respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins.<ref name="FrangopuloP138"/>

For the first 12&nbsp;years after the county was created in 1974, the county had a two-tier system of [[local government in England|local government]], and the metropolitan borough councils shared power with the [[Greater Manchester County Council]].<ref name="politics">{{cite journal | title= Greater Manchester: conurbation complexity and local government structure | author= Barlow, Max | journal= Political Geography | volume= 14 | year= 1995 | pages= 379<U+2013>400 | issue= 4| doi= 10.1016/0962-6298(95)95720-I}}</ref> The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal, comprised 106 members drawn from the ten [[metropolitan borough]]s of Greater Manchester.<ref>Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (N.D.), p.&nbsp;65.</ref> However in 1986, along with the five other [[metropolitan county]] councils and the [[Greater London Council]], the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs.<ref name="politics"/> Various [[civil parish]]es exist in certain parts of Greater Manchester.

Although the [[county council]], which was based in what is now Westminster House off [[Piccadilly Gardens]], has been abolished, a number of local government functions take place at the county level. The ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operate through the [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities]] (AGMA), which meets to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to many issues. The AGMA funds some county-wide bodies such as the [[Greater Manchester County Records Office]]. Through the AGMA, the ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operate on many policy issues, including county-wide [[Local Transport Plan]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmltp.co.uk|title=Greater Manchester Local Transport Plan|work= Greater Manchester Local Transport Plan website|publisher=<!--none obvious-->}} Retrieved on 12&nbsp;December 2006.</ref>  Some local services are provided county-wide, administered by statutory [[Local government in England#Joint-boards|joint boards]].

These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed from each of the ten boroughs (except the Waste Disposal Authority, which does not include the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan]]). The ten boroughs jointly own the [[Manchester Airport Group]] which controls [[Manchester Airport]] and three other UK airports. Other services are directly funded and managed by the local councils.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Greater Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> 'up and going'?  |author=Hebbert, Michael|coauthors=Iain Deas |journal=Policy & Politics |volume=28 |year=2000 |pages= 79<U+2013>92 |issue=1 |issn=0305 5736}}</ref>

Greater Manchester is a [[ceremonial county]] with its own [[Lord-Lieutenant]] who is the personal representative of the monarch.
