==History==
[[File:Eretz Nehederet.JPG|thumb|left|Studio of [[Eretz Nehederet]], a political satire program broadcast on Channel 2]]
In 1990, after 13 years of deliberations, the [[Knesset]] passed a law that paved the way for the establishment of commercial television in Israel. The goal was to enhance pluralism and create competition. Channel 2 began broadcasting on November 4, 1993. Three concessionaires were chosen: "[[Keshet (TV)|Keshet]]", "[[Telad]]" and "[[Reshet]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Channel 2 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3024507,00.html |newspaper=Ynetnews |date=26 January 2005 |accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> The concessionaires received a broadcasting contract for one decade and worked out a rotation agreement amongst themselves.<ref name="rashut2">{{cite web |url=http://www.rashut2.org.il/english_regulating_ch2.asp |title=The Establishment of Channel 2 |publisher=The Second Authority for Television and Radio |accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>

In April 2005, the Ministry of Communication announced that two concessionaires would receive broadcasting contracts for the following decade. Of the four competitors (the fourth being "Kan"), Keshet and Reshet were chosen. Telad, which lost the bid, stopped broadcasting on Channel 2 in October 2005. Keshet and Reshet broadcast 3 or 4 days a week, rotating every two years.

In 2011, Channel 2 installed a new digital system to preserve news content that was stored on aging videotapes and manage its archive library.<ref name="masstech" />
