A '''bicycle''', '''bike''', or '''cycle''', is a [[bicycle pedal|pedal-driven]], [[human-powered transport|human-powered vehicle]] with two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other.

First introduced in [[19th century|19th-century Europe]], bicycles now number over one billion worldwide,<ref>DidYouKnow.cd.  [http://www.didyouknow.cd/bicycles.htm There are about a billion bicycles in the world.] Retrieved [[30 July]] [[2006]].</ref> providing the principal means of transportation in many regions, notably [[China]] and [[the Netherlands]].  They are also a popular form of [[recreation]], and have been adapted for use in many other fields of human activity, including children's [[toy]]s, adult [[fitness]], [[military]] and [[police]] applications, [[courier]] services, and cycle [[sports]].

The basic shape and configuration of a typical bicycle's [[Bicycle frame|frame]], [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]], [[Bicycle pedal|pedals]], [[Bicycle saddle|saddle]], and [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] have hardly changed since the first chain-driven model was developed around 1885<ref name="herlihy">{{cite book

, although many important details have so far been improved, especially since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for individuals who pursue a particular type of [[cycling]]. 

The bicycle has affected history considerably, in both the cultural and industrial realms. In its early years, bicycle construction drew on pre-existing technologies; more recently, bicycle technology has, in turn, contributed ideas in both old and newer areas.

==History==
{{main|History of the bicycle}}
[[Image:Draisine1817.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Drais' 1817 design made to measure]]

Several innovators contributed to the history of the bicycle by developing predecessor human-powered vehicles, including the ''[[velocipede]]''. The documented ancestors of today's modern bicycle were known as pushbikes, [[Draisine]]s or [[hobby horse]]s. To use the Draisine, first introduced to the public in Paris by the [[Germany|German]] [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]] in 1818<ref name="CSTM">{{cite web

}}</ref>, the operator sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his/her feet while steering the front wheel.

[[Image:Ordinary bicycle01.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[penny-farthing]]'' or ''ordinary bicycle'' photographed in the [[<U+0160>koda museum]] in the [[Czech Republic]]]]

[[Scotland|Scottish]] [[blacksmith]] [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]] refined this in 1839 by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive to the rear wheel, thus creating the first true "bicycle" in the modern sense. In the 1850s and 1860s, Frenchmen Ernest [[Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a different direction, placing the pedals on an enlarged front wheel. Their creation, which came to be called the "Boneshaker" or "penny-farthing" (more formally an ''[[penny-farthing|ordinary bicycle]]''), featured a heavy [[steel]] frame on which they mounted wooden wheels with [[iron]] tires. The primitive bicycles of this generation were difficult to ride, and the high seat and poor weight distribution made for dangerous falls.

The subsequent ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by adding gearing, reducing the front wheel diameter, and setting the seat further back, with no loss of speed. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Starley's nephew, [[John Kemp Starley|J. K. Starley]], J. H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]]. These models were known as ''dwarf safeties'', or ''safety bicycles'', for their lower seat height and better weight distribution. Starley's 1885 Rover is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle. Soon, the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the double-triangle, ''diamond frame'' of the modern bike.

[[Image:BicyclePlymouth.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle in Plymouth at the start of the 20th century]]

New innovations increased comfort, and ushered in the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. Soon after, the rear [[freewheel]] was developed, enabling the rider to coast without the pedals spinning out of control. This refinement led to the 1898 invention of ''coaster brakes''. [[Derailleur gears]] and hand-operated, [[Bicycle brake systems|cable-pull brakes]] were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders. By the turn of the century, bicycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing were soon extremely popular.

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the wide use of these devices.

==Technical aspects==
===Legal requirements===
{{worldwide}}
[[Image:Bicycle.jpg|frame|Reflectors for night riding are one of many available safety accessories]]
The  1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle is considered a driver.  The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements, sometimes even including licensing, before it can be used on public roads.  In many jurisdictions it is an offence to use a bicycle that is not in roadworthy condition.  In most places when ridden after dark, bicycles must have functioning front and rear [[bicycle lighting|lights]], or "lamps".  As some generator or dynamo-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflectors|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory.  Since a moving bicycle makes very little noise, in many countries bicycles must have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians and other bicyclists.

===Standards===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components, to help make spare parts exchangeable:

* [[ISO 5775]] Bicycle tire and rim designations
* ISO 8090 Cycles &mdash; Terminology (same as BS 6102-4)
* ISO 4210 Cycles &mdash; Safety requirements for bicycles

===Construction and parts===
====Wheels====
{{main|Bicycle wheel}}

====Frame====
{{main|Bicycle frame}}

Nearly all modern [[upright bicycle]]s feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]], consisting of two [[triangle]]s: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Dropout (bicycle part)|dropouts]]. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear dropouts.
[[Image:Bikeinindia.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Bike on the beach in Goa, India]]

Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower standover height at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design purportedly allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress, an action made difficult by a properly-sized diamond frame. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a hybrid form, the ''mixte'' or ''[[step-through frame]]'', which splits the top tube into two small top tubes that bypass the seat tube and connect to the rear dropouts. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger builds.

Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight.  Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. [[Celluloid]] found application in mudguards, and aluminium alloys are increasingly used in components such as handlebars, seat post, and brake levers. In the 1980s [[aluminium]] alloy frames became popular, and their affordability now makes them common.  More expensive [[carbon fiber]] and [[titanium]] frames are now also available, as well as advanced steel alloys.

====Drivetrain====
{{details|bicycle gearing}}
[[Image:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|right|thumb|Shimano XT rear derailleur on a mountain bike]]
The ''drivetrain'' begins with [[bicycle pedal|pedals]] which rotate the [[Crank set|crank arms]], which are held in axis by the [[bottom bracket]]. Attached to one crank arm may be one or more ''chainring''s or sprockets which drive the [[bicycle chain|chain]], which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear [[sprocket]]s ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or freewheel). A [[bicycle gearing|gearing systems]] is used to vary the number of rear wheel revolutions produced by each turn of the pedals.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of ''[[Cadence (cycling)|cadences]]'', a variable [[gear ratio]] is helpful to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain.

When the bicycle chain shifts to a larger rear sprocket, or to a smaller front sprocket (a lower gear) every cycle on the pedal leads to fewer rotations in the freewheel (and hence the rear wheel). This allows the force required to move same distance to be distributed over more pedal cycles, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. The reverse process allows the cyclist to spend fewer pedal cycles to maintain a higher speed, but with more effort per cycle.

[[Road bicycle]]s have ''close set'' multi-step gearing, which allows very fine control of cadence, while [[utility bicycle]]s offer fewer, more widely spaced speeds. [[Mountain bike]]s and many entry-level [[racing bicycle]]s offer an extremely low gear to facilitate climbing slowly on steep hills. [[Fixed-gear bicycle]]s have only one gear combination.

====Steering and seating====
[[Image:Profile-2000-Aerobars.jpg|right|thumb|Conventional dropdown handlebars with added [[Triathlon bars|aerobars]]]]
The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] turn the [[bicycle fork|fork]] and the front wheel via the [[Stem (bike)|stem]], which rotates within the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]].  Three styles of handlebar are common.  ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position.  ''Drop handlebars'' are "dropped", offering the cyclist either an aerodynamic "crouched" position or a more upright posture in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts. Mountain bikes feature a ''straight handlebar'' which can provide better low-speed handling due to the wider nature of the bars.

[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favoured by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids the cyclist sits high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, and the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomy, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for males. 

A [[recumbent bicycle]] has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

====Brakes====
{{main|Bicycle brake systems}}
[[Image:Pedderson-bremse.jpg|thumb|Semi low-profile [[Bicycle brake systems#Rim brakes|cantilever brake]]]]

Modern bicycle ''brakes'' are either ''rim brakes'', in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims, ''internal hub brakes'', in which the friction pads are contained within the wheel hubs, or ''disc brakes''. [[Disc brakes]] are common on off-road bicycles, [[tandem bicycle|tandem]]s and [[recumbent bicycle]]s, but are considered impractical on road bicycles, which rarely encounter conditions where the advantages of discs are significant.  Hub drum brakes do not cope well with extended braking, so rim or disc brakes are favoured in hilly terrain. 

With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via [[Bowden cable]]s or hydraulic lines to the friction pads. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s, and are still common in children's bicycles. 

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes. Brakes are not required for riding on a track because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed-gear]], meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the crank is moving. To slow down one may apply resistance to the pedals. While it is illegal in most jurisdictions to cycle on roads without brakes, a fixed-gear bike without brakes can be slowed by skidding the rear wheel. This involves unweighting the rear wheel and applying a backwards force to the pedals, causing the rear wheel to lock up and slide along the road. Most track bike frames and forks do not have holes for mounting brakes, although with their increasing popularity among some road cyclists, some manufacturers have designed their track frames to enable the fitting of brakes.

====Suspension====
{{main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle in order to protect them from the roughness of the terrain over which they travel. Bicycle suspension are used primarily on [[mountain bicycle]]s, but are also common on [[hybrid bicycle]]s, and can even be found on some [[road bicycle]]s as they can help deal with problematic vibration.

====Accessories and repairs====
Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on [[utility bicycles]] to enhance their usefulness and comfort. [[Mudguard]]s (or ''fenders'') protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain. [[Kick stand]]s keep a bicycle upright when parked. Front-mounted ''baskets'' for carrying goods are often used. [[Bicycle rack#Bicycle mounted bike racks|Rear racks]] and [[pannier]]s or other carriers can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children.
[[Image:Reiserad-beladen.jpg|right|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with head lamp, pump, rear rack, fenders/mud-guards, and numerous saddle-bags.]]

''Toe-clips'' and ''toestraps'' and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help to keep the foot planted firmly in the proper position on the pedals, and enable the cyclist to pull as well as push the pedals. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed and distance. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, [[Bicycle pump|tire pump]], [[Bicycle lock|security lock]], mirror, and bell.<ref name="bicycleuniverse"> {{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info}} </ref>

A [[bicycle helmet]] reduces injury in the event of a collision, and a certified helmet is legally required for some riders in some jurisdictions. Helmets are classified as an accessory<ref name="bicycleuniverse" /> or an item of clothing by others.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm |title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing |accessdate=2006-09-13 |work=About Bicycling |publisher=About.com}} </ref>

Many cyclists carry ''tool kits'', containing at least a tire patch kit (and/or a spare tube), [[tire lever]]s, and hex wrenches. More specialised parts now require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer. Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, are complex, and many prefer to leave [[repair and maintenance|maintenance and repairs]] to professional [[bicycle mechanic]]s. Others maintain their own bicycles, enhancing their enjoyment of the [[hobby]] of cycling.

In some areas it is possible to purchase road-side assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]].

===Performance===
{{main|Bicycle performance}}

In both biological and mechanical terms, the bicycle is extraordinarily efficient. In terms of the amount of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance, investigators have calculated it to be the most efficient self-powered means of transportation.<ref>"Bicycle Technology", S.S. Wilson, [[Scientific American]], March 1973</ref> From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10-15%.<ref>

In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also a most efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human being travelling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around 10-15 mph (16-24 km/h), using only the energy required to walk, is the most energy-efficient means of transport generally available. Air drag, which increases with the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs with increasing speed. A bicycle which places the rider in a seated position, [[supine position]] or, more rarely, [[prone position]], and which may be covered in an aerodynamic fairing to achieve very low air drag, is referred to as a [[recumbent bicycle]] or [[human powered vehicle]].  The rider's body creates the greatest amount of drag on an upright bicycle, compared to just the bicycle itself, at about 75% of the total drag.

===Dynamics===
{{main|Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics}}

A bicycle stays upright by being steered so as to keep its centre of gravity over its wheels. This steering is usually provided by the rider, but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.

A bicycle must lean in order to turn. This lean is induced by a method known as [[countersteering]], which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands or indirectly by leaning the bicycle.

Short-wheelbase or [[tall bike|tall bicycles]], when braking, can generate enough stopping force at the front wheel in order to flip longitudinally. This action, especially if performed on purpose, is known as a [[stoppie]] or front wheelie.

[[Image:BikesInAmsterdam 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|right|thumb|Present day: Bikes are popular in Amsterdam]]

===Economic implications===
Bicycle manufacturing proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[Bearing (mechanical)|ball bearings]], [[washer (mechanical)|washer]]s, and [[sprocket]]s. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early [[automobile]]s and [[aircraft]]. J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then the [[Rover (car)|Rover]] auto maker.  The [[Morris Motor Company]] (in [[Oxford]]) and [[<U+0160>koda Auto|<U+0160>koda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright Brothers]].<ref>

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames. Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by eastern companies. For example, some sixty percent of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as [[China]] and [[India]] become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles. One of the major reasons for the proliferation of Chinese-made bicycles in foreign markets is the lower cost of labour in China.<ref>[[The Economist]], [[15 February]] [[2003]]</ref>

===Female emancipation===

[[Image:Woman with Bicycle 1890s.jpg|thumb|Woman with bicycle, 1890s]]
The diamond-frame safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the [[New Woman]] of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States.  

The bicycle was recognised by nineteenth-century [[feminist]]s and [[suffragist]]s as a "freedom machine" for women.  American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on [[February 2]] [[1896]]: "Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammelled womanhood." In 1895 [[Frances Willard]], the tightly-laced president of the [[Women<U+2019>s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote a book called ''How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle'', in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named "Gladys", for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism.  Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, "I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum." 

The male anger at the freedom symbolised by the New (bicycling) Woman was demonstrated when the male undergraduates of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] chose to show their opposition to the admission of women as full members of the university by hanging a woman in effigy in the main town square -- tellingly, a woman on a bicycle.  This was as late as 1897.<ref>http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/about_history2.shtml</ref>

In the 1890s the [[bicycle craze]] led to a movement for so-called [[rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].

===Social implications===
Sociologists suggest that bicycles enlarged the [[gene pool]] for rural workers, by enabling them to easily reach the next town and increase their ''courting radius''.  In cities, bicycles helped reduce crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses, with all the knock-on effects this brought to society.  Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking, and three to four times as fast.

==Types of bicycle==
{{main|list of bicycle types}}
Bicycles can be categorized in different ways: e.g. by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s,  [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX]] bicycles. Less common types include [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]], and [[folding bicycle|folding models]]. [[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[quadracycle]]s are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" by users.
