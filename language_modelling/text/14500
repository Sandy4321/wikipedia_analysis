'''''The Penelopiad''''' is a [[novella]] by [[Margaret Atwood]]. It was published in 2005 as part of the first set of books in the ''[[Canongate Myth Series]]'' where contemporary authors rewrite ancient [[Mythology|myths]]. In ''The Penelopiad'', [[Penelope]] reminisces on the events during the ''[[Odyssey]]'', life in [[Hades]], [[Odysseus]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and her relationships with her parents. A [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of the twelve maids, whom Odysseus believed were disloyal and whom [[Telemachus]] hanged, interrupt Penelope's narrative to express their view on events. The maids' interludes use a new genre each time, including a [[jump-rope rhyme]], a [[lament]], an [[idyll]], a [[ballad]], a lecture, a court trial and several types of songs.

The novella's central themes include the effects of story-telling perspectives, [[double standard]]s between the sexes and the classes, and the fairness of justice. Atwood had previously used characters and storylines from Greek mythology in fiction such as her novel ''[[The Robber Bride]]'', short story ''The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions'' and poems "Circe: Mud Poems" and "Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing" but used [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' and [[E. V. Rieu]] and [[D. C. H. Rieu]]'s version of the ''Odyssey'' to prepare for this novella.

The book was translated into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers. In the Canadian market, it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in ''[[Maclean's]]'' and number two in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', but did not place on the [[New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]] in the American market. Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood, even amongst her finest work, while others found some aspects, like the chorus of maids, disagreeable.

A theatrical version was co-produced by the Canadian [[National Arts Centre]] and the British [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]. The play was performed at the [[Swan Theatre (Stratford)|Swan Theatre]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and the National Arts Centre in [[Ottawa]] during the summer and fall of 2007 by an all-female cast led by director [[Josette Bushell-Mingo]]. In the winter season 2011/2012, the show will be given its professional Toronto premiere by [[Nightwood Theatre]], with an all-female cast led by director Kelly Thornton and starring [[Megan Follows]] as Penelope.

== Background ==
Publisher Jamie Byng of [[Canongate Books]] solicited author [[Margaret Atwood]] to write a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages as part of an international project called the ''[[Canongate Myth Series]]''. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project.<ref name="Atwood">{{citation | first = Margaret | last = Atwood | author-link = Margaret Atwood | title = The Myths Series and Me | url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6286775.html | accessdate = 2008-03-09 | magazine = [[Publishers Weekly]] | date = 2005-11-28 | volume = 252 | issue = 47 | page = 58 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}.{{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref> From her home in [[Toronto]], the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the [[Ymir|Norse creation myth]] and a Native American story but struggled.<ref name="Tonkin">{{citation | first = Boyd | last = Tonkin | title = Margaret Atwood: A personal odyssey and how she rewrote Homer | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/margaret-atwood-a-personal-odyssey-and-how-she-rewrote-homer-512771.html | accessdate = 2008-03-09 | newspaper = [[The Independent]] | date = 2005-10-28}}.</ref> After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref name="Atwood" /> She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.<ref name="Tonkin" />

== Plot ==
[[File:Penelope-Homer-Odyssey-Project Gutenberg eText.jpg|thumb|''Penelope'' in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]

The novel recaps [[Penelope]]'s life in hindsight from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in [[Sparta]], her marriage to [[Odysseus]], her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: [[Icarius|her father]] became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and [[Periboea|her mother]] was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, even though he was mocked behind his back by [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, [[Ithaca]]. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother [[Anticleia]], nor his nurse [[Eurycleia]], liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, [[Telemachus]], Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but on the issue of the maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.<ref name="Penelopiad">{{citation | last = Atwood | first = Margaret | author-link = Margaret Atwood | date = 2005-10-11 | title = The Penelopiad | series = [[Canongate Myth Series]] | place = Toronto | publisher = Knopf Canada | isbn = 0-676-97425-2 }}.</ref>

During her narrative, Penelope expresses opinions on several people, addresses historical misconceptions, and comments on life in Hades. She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life. Penelope identifies Odysseus' specialty as making people look like fools and wonders why his stories have survived so long, despite being an admitted liar. She dispels the rumour that she slept with [[Amphinomus]] and the rumour that she slept with all the suitors and consequently gave birth to [[Pan (god)|Pan]].<ref name="Penelopiad" /><ref>Though not linguistically related, Pan's name (<U+03A0><U+03AC><U+03BD>) is virtually identical to the ancient Greek word <U+03C0><U+1FB6><U+03BD>, meaning "all"; the apparent equivalence between the two words seems to have inspired the myth that Penelope slept with "all" the suitors, resulting in the god's birth.</ref>

Between chapters in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and dream of being princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder if they would have killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.<ref name="Penelopiad" />

The novella is divided into 29 chapters with introduction, notes, and acknowledgments sections. Structured similarly to a [[Drama#Greek|classical Greek drama]], the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids.<ref name="Morrow">{{citation | first = Martin | last = Morrow | date = 2007-07-09 | title = Desperate housewife | publisher = [[CBC.ca]] | url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/theatre/atwood.html | accessdate = 2008-03-07 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080223233027/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/theatre/atwood.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate = 2008-02-23 }}</ref> Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a [[jump-rope rhyme]] and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a [[lament]], a [[Folk music|folk song]], an [[idyll]], a [[sea shanty]], a [[ballad]], a [[drama]], an anthropology [[lecture]], a [[Trial (law)|court trial]], and a [[love song]].

== Major themes ==

=== Perspectives ===
The novella illustrates the differences perspectives can make. The stories told in the ''Odyssey'' by [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] and [[Menelaus]] to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a [[Scheria]]n court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in ''The Penelopiad'' Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic [[Polyphemus|cyclops]]. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to [[Clytemnestra]] who killed [[Agamemnon]] upon his return from Troy.<ref name="Collins" /><ref name="Passaro">{{citation | first = Vince | last = Passaro | title = Woman, Waiting | magazine = [[O, The Oprah Magazine]] | date = November 2005 | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | page = 184 }}.</ref> In ''The Penelopiad'', Penelope feels compelled to tell her story because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The ''Odyssey'' makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.<ref name="Collins" />

=== Feminism and double standards ===
The book has been called "feminist",<ref name="Hand" /><ref name="Heller" /><ref name=Observer>{{citation | first = Peter | last = Conrad | title = The pull of the Greeks | newspaper = [[The Observer]] | date = 2005-10-23 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/oct/23/classics.jeanettewinterson}}</ref> and more specifically "vintage Atwood-feminist",<ref name="Harris" /> but Atwood disagrees, saying, "I wouldn't even call it feminist. Every time you write something from the point of view of a woman, people say that it's feminist."<ref name="Hiller">{{citation | first = Susanne | last = Hiller | title = A weaver's tale | newspaper = [[National Post]] | date = 2005-10-22 |page = WP4}}.</ref> ''The Penelopiad'''s antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood's previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in ''[[Cat's Eye (novel)|Cat's Eye]]'', and Iris and Laura in ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'', and follows Atwood's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the ''Odyssey'', like Penelope recognising Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope's dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids' lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirises [[Robert Graves]]' theory of a [[goddess worship|matriarchal lunar cult]] in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] society in favor of [[patriarchy]]. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist [[Claude L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss]]' ''Elementary Structures of Kinship'': "Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money."<ref name="Suzuki">{{citation | last = Suzuki | first = Mihoko | date = Spring 2007 | title = Rewriting the Odyssey in the Twenty-First Century: Mary Zimmerman's ''Odyssey'' and Margaret Atwood's ''Penelopiad'' | journal = College Literature | volume = 34 | issue = 2 |pages=263<U+2013>278 |doi=10.1353/lit.2007.0023}}.</ref>

Double standards amongst genders and classes are exposed throughout the novella. Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him. The maids' relations with the suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution. Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy. At the same time, Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though, as Atwood reveals, Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped.<ref name="Suzuki" />

=== Narrative justice ===
Penelope's story is an attempt at narrative justice to [[Retributive justice|retribute]] Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the ''Odyssey'' as the archetypal female.<ref name="Kapuscinski" /><ref name="Collins">{{citation | last = Collins | first = Shannon |date=Fall 2006 | title = Setting the Stories Straight: A Reading of Margaret Atwood's ''The Penelopiad'' | journal = Carson-Newman Studies | volume = XI | issue = 1 |pages=57<U+2013>66 | url = http://library.cn.edu/speccoll/cn_studies/volxx_issy/v11n1_2006.pdf#page=62 | accessdate = 2008-06-05}}.</ref> Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter, a position she held in Ithaca as the head of state and, during Odysseus' absence, as head of the household. The ancient form of justice and punishment, which was swift and simple due to the lack of courts, prisons, and currency, is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens. Penelope's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial,<ref name="Miner" /> as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her.<ref name="Kapuscinski" />

The maids also deliver their version of narrative justice on Odysseus and Telemachus, who ordered and carried out their execution, and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing. The maids do not have the same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to unauthoritative genres, though their persistence eventually leads to more valued cultural forms. Their testimony, contrasted with Penelope's excuses while condemning Helen, demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth. When compared with the historical record, dominated by the stories in the ''Odyssey'', the conclusion, as one academic states, is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by "who has the power to say who is punished, whose ideas count", and that "justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics".<ref name="Kapuscinski" />

Atwood's use of myths follows [[archetypal literary criticism]] and specifically the work of [[Northrop Frye]] and his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]''. According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but are part of an underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In ''The Penelopiad'', Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimisation while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.<ref name="Kapuscinski" />

The edition of the ''Odyssey'' that Atwood read was the [[E. V. Rieu]] and [[D. C. H. Rieu]]'s translation. For research she consulted [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The Greek Myths]]''.<ref>{{citation | last = Atwood | first = Margaret |author-link =Margaret Atwood |date=2005-10-11 | title = The Penelopiad |series= [[Canongate Myth Series]] |place=Toronto |publisher=Knopf Canada |isbn= 0-676-97425-2 |page=197}}.</ref> Graves, an adherent to [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s theory that the ''Odyssey'' was written by a woman, also wrote ''[[The White Goddess]]'' which formed the basis of the Maid's anthropology lecture.<ref name="Larrington">{{citation | first = Carolyne | last = Larrington | title = Happily ever after | url = http://tls.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25363-1928338,00.html | accessdate = 2008-03-09 | newspaper = [[The Times Literary Supplement]] | date = 2005-11-18}}.</ref><ref name="Beard" />

Atwood had previously written using themes and characters from ancient Greek myths. She wrote a short story in ''Ovid Metamorphosed'' called ''The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions'' re-telling a myth with [[Apollo]] and the immortal prophet the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl]] from the perspective of the latter living in the modern age.<ref name="Harris" /> Her 1993 novel ''[[The Robber Bride]]'' roughly parallels the ''Iliad'' but is set in Toronto. In that novel the characters Tony and Zenia share the same animosity and competition as Penelope and Helen in ''The Penelopiad''.<ref name="Suzuki" /> Her poem "Circe: Mud Poems", published in 1976, casts doubt on Penelope's honourable image:
: She's up to something, she's weaving
: histories, they are never right,
: she has to do them over,
: she is weaving her version[...]<ref>{{citation | first = Margaret | last = Atwood | contribution = Circe: Mud Poems | title = Selected Poems, 1965<U+2013>1975 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Books | isbn = 0-395-40422-3 | year = 1976 | page = 201 }}.</ref>

Atwood published "Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing" in her 1996 collection ''Morning in the Burned House'' in which Helen appears in a contemporary setting as an erotic dancer and justifies her exploitation as men fantasize over her:

: You think I'm not a goddess?
: Try me.
: This is a torch song.
: Touch me and you'll burn.<ref>{{citation | first = Margaret | last = Atwood | contribution = Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing | title = Morning in the Burned House | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Books | isbn = 0-395-82521-0 | year = 1996 | pages = 33<U+2013>36 }}.</ref>

== Theatrical adaptation ==
Following a successful dramatic reading directed by [[Phyllida Lloyd]] at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]] on 26 October 2005, Atwood finished a draft theatrical script.<ref name=Taylor>{{citation | first = Craig | last = Taylor | url = http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2007.10--margaret-atwood-novel/ | title = Twelve Angry Maids | newspaper = [[The Walrus]] | date = October 2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-07}}.</ref> The Canadian [[National Arts Centre]] and the British [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] expressed interest and both agreed to co-produce. Funding was raised mostly from nine Canadian women, dubbed the "Penelope Circle", who each donated [[CAD$]]50,000 to the National Arts Centre.<ref>{{citation | first = Mitch | last = Potter | url = http://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/242766 | title = Stage version of Atwood novel gets warm embrace | newspaper = [[The Toronto Star]] | date = 2007-08-03 |place = Stratford-Upon-Avon | accessdate = 2008-03-07}}.</ref><ref>{{citation |year= 2007 | title = The Penelope Circle |place= Ottawa |publisher= National Arts Centre Foundation | url = http://www.nac-cna.ca/en/theatre/the_penelopiad/circle.asp | accessdate = 2008-03-07|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080302090818/http://www.nac-cna.ca/en/theatre/the_penelopiad/circle.asp |archivedate = March 2, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> An all-female cast was selected consisting of seven Canadian and six British actors, with [[Josette Bushell-Mingo]] directing and [[Veronica Tennant]] as the choreographer.<ref name="Morrow" /> For music a trio, consisting of percussions, keyboard, and cello, were positioned above the stage.

Atwood's script gave little stage direction allowing Bushell-Mingo to develop the action. Critics in both countries lauded [[Penny Downie]]'s performance as Penelope, but found the play had too much narration of story rather than dramatisation.<ref name=Marlowe>{{citation | first = Sam | last = Marlowe | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/edinburgh/article2196598.ece | title = The Penelopiad | newspaper = [[The Times]] | date = 2007-08-06 | accessdate = 2008-03-07}}.</ref><ref>{{citation | date = 2007-09-22 | title = An epic tragedy with a whole lot of sparkle | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] |page=A23}}.</ref> Adjustments made between productions resulted in the Canadian performance having emotional depth that was lacking in Bushell-Mingo's direction of the twelve maids.<ref>{{citation | first = Kamal | last = Al-Solaylee | url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070804.wpenelope0804/BNStory/Entertainment/Theatre/ | title = Atwood's baby has come a long way | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = 2007-08-04 |page=R1 | accessdate = 2008-03-07}}.</ref><ref>{{citation | first = Kamal | last = Al-Solaylee | title = A hit, but not a home run | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = 2007-09-24 |page=R1}}.</ref> The play subsequently had runs in Vancouver at the [[Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage]] between October 26 and November 20, 2011,<ref>{{citation | first = Colin | last = Thomas | url = http://www.straight.com/article-516466/vancouver/penelopiad-container-some-interesting-politics | title = The Penelopiad is a container for some interesting politics | newspaper = [[The Georgia Straight]] | date = 2011-10-27 | accessdate = 2011-11-03}}.</ref> and in Toronto, produced by the [[Nightwood Theatre]] and staged at [[Buddies in Bad Times Theatre]] between January 10<U+2013>29, 2012.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.nightwoodtheatre.net/index.php/whats_on/the_penelopiad | title = The Penelopiad | publisher= [[Nightwood Theatre]] | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2011-11-03}}.</ref> The Nightwood Theatre show was directed by Kelly Thornton with choreography by Monica Dottor and starring [[Megan Follows]].
