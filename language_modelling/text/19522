The '''Hadong Ambush''' was an engagement between [[United States]] and [[North Korean]] forces early in the [[Korean War]] on July 27, 1950 in the village of [[Hadong]] in southern [[South Korea]]. The fight ended in a North Korean victory following a successful ambush of US forces.

The [[US Army]]'s 3rd Battalion, [[29th Infantry Regiment]], a newly formed unit consisting mostly of inexperienced raw recruits, was ordered to move to the [[South Korean]] village of Hadong to hold the pass there from advancing forces of the [[North Korean People's Army]]. Unprepared for combat, the American forces walked into an ambush in which most of the battalion's command staff was killed in the pass, leaving lower-ranking soldiers mounting a disorganized struggle against North Korean troops on higher ground and in prepared positions.

For three hours the battalion fought, pinned in a crossfire by North Korean soldiers on higher ground. North Korean forces were able to separate the American unit's elements from one another and kill most of its leadership, further disorganizing them. Following the failed operation, the wounded US commander ordered a withdrawal, which quickly became disorganized, resulting in hundreds of casualties. Destroyed after its first engagement, the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry was disbanded and merged with other units as the North Korean forces advanced through the pass and attacked US positions to the east.

== Background ==
=== Outbreak of war ===
Following the outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the [[Republic of Korea]] (South Korea) by its northern neighbor, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (North Korea), the [[United Nations]] decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea. The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the [[Far East]] had been steadily decreasing since the end of [[World War II]], five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] of the [[Eighth United States Army]], which was headquartered in [[Japan]]. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea.<ref name="Var3">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=3}}</ref>

[[File:US Retreat from Taejon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A city square filled with soldiers and civilians. Smoke is in the sky in the background behind a large building.|US Forces retreat during the [[Battle of Taejon]]]]
The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial "shock" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow follow on forces to arrive.<ref name=Alexander52>{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=52}}</ref> The division was consequently outnumbered and outgunned for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans, making time for the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], and other Eighth Army supporting units to move into position. South Korean forces in the meantime were systematically defeated and forced south along Korea's east coast, with entire divisions being overrun by the North Koreans' superior firepower and equipment.<ref name=Alexander52/> Advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the [[Battle of Osan]] on July 5, during the first battle between American and North Korean forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=15}}</ref> For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith, 24th Infantry Division soldiers were repeatedly defeated and forced south by the North Korean force's superior numbers and equipment.<ref name="Var4">{{harvnb|Varhola|2000|p=4}}</ref><ref name="Alex90">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=90}}</ref> The regiments of the 24th Infantry Division were systematically pushed south in battles around [[Battle of Chochiwon|Chochiwon]], [[Battle of Chonan|Chonan]], and [[Battle of Pyongtaek|Pyongtaek]].<ref name="Var4"/> The 24th Infantry Division made a final stand in the [[Battle of Taejon]], being almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20.<ref name="Alex105">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=105}}</ref> By that time, the Eighth Army's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region, with new UN units arriving every day.<ref name="Fehr103">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=103}}</ref>

=== Replacements arrive ===
On July 20, 400 hastily-assembled US Army recruits arrived in [[Okinawa]] aboard the [[USS Walker (DD-517)|USS ''Walker'']].<ref name="Alex111"/> The recruits were assigned to the [[29th Infantry Regiment]], [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], a command that was preparing other battalions to move into Korea and to relieve the other units of the 24th Infantry Division.<ref name="Catch23">{{harvnb|Catchpole|p=23}}</ref><ref name="Apple214">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=214}}</ref> The new formations, now consisting mostly of recruits who had no combat experience and grouped into two battalions, were immediately sent into Pusan. The headquarters of the regiment remained behind to form a new regiment.<ref name="Alex111">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=111}}</ref> This regiment would originally be in charge of the defense of Okinawa but would later be rushed into Korea.<ref name="Apple214"/> The two battalions landed in Pusan on July 21 and were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, but they retained their designations as the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 29th Infantry Regiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=8}}</ref> Instead of being given time to train and prepare to enter the front lines, the battalions were immediately sent to the regiment's sector at [[Chinju]].<ref name="Fehr103"/><ref>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=198}}</ref> By July 22 the units were on the front lines with new equipment that was not prepared for combat, despite promises from several commanders that they would be given time to do so.<ref name="Apple214"/><ref name="Alex112">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=112}}</ref><ref name="Fehr104">{{harvnb|Fehrenbach|2001|p=104}}</ref>

== Battle ==
American planners believed that the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the [[4th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 4th Infantry Division]], having just received replacements following its victory at Taejon.<ref name="Apple222"/> However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the [[6th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 6th Infantry Division]] under the command of General Pang Ho San.<ref name="Mil197">{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=197}}</ref> The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.<ref name="Apple222">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=222}}</ref>

=== Arrival ===
[[File:Map Hadong-gun.png|thumb|alt=a map of the southern tip of a peninsula with an eastern region marked|Hadong county, South Korea, area of the ambush]]
Immediately after arrival, the commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Regiment, Colonel Ned D. Moore, ordered the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment to move out and seize [[Hadong]], a road junction {{convert|35|mi}} southwest of Chinju, where about 500 North Korean soldiers were reported to be moving.<ref name="Mil197"/><ref name="Alex112"/> Eighth Army had also received reports that the enemy had been fighting South Korean police who were resisting in the village of Hadong, one mile west of the pass.<ref>{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=213}}</ref> The battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harold W. Mott, alerted his troops, and at 0030 on July 26, the battalion departed alone on its mission.<ref name="Alex112"/> It had a strength of 925 men.<ref name="Mil197"/> The battalion was to hold the pass, a southern route into Pusan, from any advancing North Korean forces.<ref name="Catch23"/> Hadong was seen as a significant path into Chinju, despite its lack of defenses.<ref name="Millett403"/>

The North Koreans, in the meantime, advanced to the town of Hadong and captured the city which was lightly defended by a group of South Korean police, as no military was avaliable due to manpower shortages.<ref name="Millett403">{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=403}}</ref> The Koreans, members of the NK 6th Division, set up in roads east of the town and began sending probes and scout parties to the east. The move was part of a larger coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then [[Masan]], in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit.<ref name="Apple222"/> Thinking the UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively scout to Chinju as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=402}}</ref>

Accompanying the 3rd Battalion was South Korean [[Major General]] Chae Byong Duk, South Korea's Army Chief of Staff who had been relieved after the fall of [[Seoul]].<ref name="Mil197"/><ref name="Millett404">{{harvnb|Millett|2000|p=404}}</ref> Having fallen out of favor with the South Korean command, Duk was to be an interpreter and guide for 3rd Battalion on its mission.<ref name="Alex112"/> He had few soldiers of his own, and accompanied the battalion with only a few of his aides.<ref name="Fehr104"/> The battalion was forced to take several detours through Konyang because of impassable roads, and it was delayed in its arrival to Hadong.<ref name="Catch23"/> During this trip, shortly before dawn, the troops encountered a truck of 15 South Korean [[militia]] who claimed they were the remains of a 400-man unit that had been wiped out by North Korean forces in the area.<ref name="Apple215">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=215}}</ref> Mott sent his executive officer back to the command post to ask Moore for further instructions, and Moore ordered them to proceed with the mission. Because the battalion had no radio equipment it was forced to send a runner to relay this information, and he returned by nightfall, forcing the battalion to encamp in the village of Hoengchon, {{convert|3|mi}} west of Hadong, for the night.<ref name="Alex112"/>

=== Ambush ===
At 0845 on July 27 the battalion moved out towards the Hadong pass, arriving within an hour. When it was within {{convert|1000|yd}} of the pass, L Company at the head of the formation spotted a North Korean patrol. The company's heavy weapons were fired at the patrol, forcing it to withdraw but causing no casualties. L Company then rushed the pass and dug in at 0930, waiting for a scheduled [[airstrike]] on the village of Hadong one mile to the west at 0945.<ref name="Alex112"/> Behind L Company was the battalion command group, followed by K and M Companies, with I Company covering the rear.<ref name="Apple216">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=216}}</ref>

The battalion's command group, including Mott, Duk and most of the senior officers, approached the pass as L Company took cover on the left side of the road. As they approached the pass, a company of North Korean soldiers was spotted up the road, part of a scouting party looking to probe further east. L Company was preparing to [[ambush]] the North Koreans when they got closer,<ref name="Alex112"/> but before this could happen, Duk called out to the Koreans demanding they identify themselves.<ref name="Fehr104"/> The North Koreans immediately ducked for cover in the ditches on the side of the road, and L Company opened up on them.<ref name="Millett404"/><ref name="Alex113">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=113}}</ref>

[[File:Hadong 1950.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large village in a mountain pass with roads leading through it|Hadong village, 1950]]
Immediately the American forces were hit with machine gun and mortar fire from the north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in.<ref name="Mil197"/> The first burst of machine gun fire killed Duk and wounded most of the other commanders, including Mott.<ref name="Millett404"/><ref name="Alex113"/> Mott managed to make it to the ditch where American forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion.<ref name="Apple217">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=217}}</ref> North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge.<ref name="Fehr104"/> Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a [[US Air Force]] tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes.<ref name="Catch23"/> During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.<ref name="Alex113"/>

The 3rd Battalion had walked into a preregistered North Korean ambush, and almost its entire command ground was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the North Korean forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with two members of the company killed by [[bayonets]].<ref name="Alex113"/> L Company was separated from the rest of the battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge.<ref name="Apple218">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=218}}</ref> K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so.<ref name="Apple219">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=219}}</ref> However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support.<ref name="Alex113"/> North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them.<ref name="Catch24">{{harvnb|Catchpole|2001|p=24}}</ref> By noon, the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces.<ref name="Fehr104"/>

=== American withdrawal ===
At 1200, Mott was brought to the position of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began moving down the pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a {{convert|20|ft}}-wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat.<ref name="Alex114">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=114}}</ref> Many of the men of L Company, as well as some of the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.<ref name="Apple219"/>

Survivors from 3rd Battalion disengaged from the battle in groups.<ref name="Mil197"/> The largest group of 97 survivors moved {{convert|5|mi}} south to the small port of Noryangjin where a fishing vessel carried them out to a South Korean patrol boat.<ref name="Alex114"/> Other groups of soldiers escaped into the hills while some had to fight their way back to Chinju.<ref name="Catch24"/> Most of the battalion's officers were casualties in the fight, and the scattered and disorganized retreat destroyed the battalion.<ref name="Fehr104"/> Stragglers continued to wander into the 19th Infantry's lines throughout the rest of the day.<ref name="Apple220">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=220}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
More than half of the battalion was lost during its first engagement. Only 354 members of the battalion, including some [[walking wounded]], were able to report for duty the next day. A captured North Korean soldier reported that around 100 men had been captured at Hadong. A later search uncovered 313 American bodies, most along the river and in the rice paddies south of the pass.<ref name="Millett404"/><ref name="Mil197"/><ref name="Alex114"/> Official casualties for the Americans in the battle were 242 [[killed in action|killed]], 135 [[wounded in action|wounded]], 51 [[prisoner of war|captured]], and 67 [[missing in action|missing]], for a total of 495 casualties. However, two of the prisoners died in captivity and all but four of the missing were found dead, leaving the total number killed during the battle at 307.<ref name="Ecker9">{{harvnb|Ecker|2004|p=9}}</ref> Over 30 vehicles and practically all of the crew-served and individual weapons used by 3rd Battalion were lost.<ref name="Apple221">{{harvnb|Appleman|1998|p=221}}</ref> Casualties of North Korean forces could not be estimated by the American units.<ref name="Apple219"/>

The shattered 3rd Battalion traveled back to Chinju to join the 19th Infantry Regiment.<ref name="Alex114"/> There it was disbanded and its remaining men were assigned to the 19th Infantry Regiment, which itself had suffered heavy losses.<ref name="Fehr104"/><ref name="Mil199">{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=199}}</ref> Meanwhile, the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry was sent to Anui to the north, where it was attacked and pushed back repeatedly by the [[4th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 4th Infantry Division]].<ref name="Alex114"/> On July 31, the North Korean 6th Infantry Division struck Chinju, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry, forcing them to withdraw east.<ref name="Alex115">{{harvnb|Alexander|2003|p=115}}</ref> This left the southern entries to Pusan open, but the North Korean 6th Division was unable to exploit it due to its extended supply line.<ref name="Catch24"/> The 6th Division eventually advanced further east, attempting to capture the city of [[Masan]], but newly-reorganized troops of the US Army repulsed them and inflicted heavy casualties on them less than a week later during the [[Battle of the Notch]].<ref name="Apple242">{{harvnb|Alexander|2001|p=242}}</ref>
