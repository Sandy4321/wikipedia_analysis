"'''Greg Pikitis'''" is the seventh episode of the [[Parks and Recreation (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', and the thirteenth overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on October 29, 2009. In the episode, [[Leslie Knope|Leslie]] attempts to catch a suspected teenage vandal in the act of defacing a public statue. Meanwhile, [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] throws a [[Halloween]] party, which turns out to be very boring until [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] livens it up.

The episode was written by series co-founder [[Michael Schur]] and directed by Dean Holland, an editor on the series. "Greg Pikitis" featured a guest performance by stand-up comedian [[Louis C.K.]] as [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Dave Sanderson|Dave Sanderson]], Leslie's police officer boyfriend. It also featured [[Cody Klop]] as Greg Pikitis, a teenager whom Leslie considers her nemesis.

According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], "Greg Pikitis" was seen by 4.96 million viewers, only a slight drop from the previous week despite direct competition from the [[2009 World Series]]. The episode received generally positive reviews.

==Plot==
[[Leslie Knope|Leslie]] ([[Amy Poehler]]) visits the Pawnee high school to confront Greg Pikitis ([[Cody Klop]]), a teenager who she describes as her "arch-nemesis". Leslie warns Greg she knows he vandalizes the town's statue of Mayor Percy every [[Halloween]], but that she will be watching him closely and will catch him this year. Greg casually denies having any such plans. At the Pawnee town hall, [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] ([[Rashida Jones]]) talks excitedly about her upcoming Halloween party. She asks the others not to mention it to [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]), but she is disappointed to learn [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Jerry Gergich|Jerry]] ([[Jim O'Heir]]) has already told him. That night, Leslie watches Greg with the help of her boyfriend, Pawnee police officer [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Dave Sanderson|Dave Sanderson]] ([[Louis C.K.]]), while [[Andy Dwyer|Andy]] ([[Chris Pratt]]), who now has a part-time job with the parks department, guards the statue.

Ann's party is off to a boring start and she soon begins to fear it will be a failure altogether. When Tom and his wife [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Wendy Haverford|Wendy]] ([[Jama Williamson]]) arrive, however, Tom spices up the party by turning the living room into a dance floor. The party is soon a big hit, and Ann thanks Tom profusely. Wendy tells [[Ron Swanson|Ron]] ([[Nick Offerman]]) she knows Ron learned her marriage to Tom was a "[[green card marriage]]" to keep her from being deported to [[Canada]], and thanks him for his discretion. She tells him they will soon be able to divorce without raising any suspicions, unaware that Tom is visibly upset about it.

After watching Greg for hours, Leslie and Dave decide to go to Ann's party. They stop at the parks department to get Leslie's costume, only to find the office has been [[toilet papering|toilet papered]] and vandalized. Leslie immediately suspects Greg, even though they had been watching him all night. Dave reluctantly agrees to bring Greg in for questioning, but Greg insists he is innocent. Andy comes in and questions Greg, pretending to be an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Burt Macklin, but Greg is so mean to him Andy soon starts crying. Greg's mother eventually arrives and takes him away after threatening to report the trio for holding her son without proof of his guilt.

Later, Andy helps Leslie clean the parks office and, after a few beers, they decide to toilet paper Greg's house. Dave arrives in his police car and tells them he had been called to stop them. When an unfamiliar woman comes out of the house, Leslie thinks she has toilet papered the wrong house. However, the woman reveals she is Greg's actual mother, and that Greg hired a "fake mother" off of [[Craigslist]] to get him out of trouble. When she realizes Greg is not home, Leslie believes he is vandalizing the mayor statue. They go to the statue and catch Greg in the process; although Leslie wishes to have him "locked up," Dave points out he is still a minor and may only receive some time in juvenile hall. Later, Leslie wonders how Greg managed to trash the parks department. The episode ends with a flashback showing Greg sneaking into the department disguised as a janitor, hiding in a dumpster until everybody leaves, then vandalizing the office.

Alan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' said the episode was "the version of ''Parks and Recreation'' that I most enjoy: silly, but also intentionally small in scale". He particularly praised Louis CK and some of the smaller jokes in the episode, like the fact that a gay character's "straight guy" Halloween costume is identical to Mark's regular wardrobe.<ref name="Sepinwall" /> Steve Heisler of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said the episode "demonstrated how an episode of P&R can work wonders<U+2014>dial up the conditions that might drive a character insane, as they did to Leslie, and watch them squirm". He also said the episode featured every supporting character well, but that Ann was less funny without a "wacky person to play off of".<ref name="AVClub" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine critic [[James Poniewozik]] said it was a "strong episode that hit office and personal sides of the characters equally well". Poniewozik praised Pratt and Louis C.K. in particular, but also said Leslie was pushed "a little too far into the crazy-obsessive end of the spectrum".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Poniewozik |first=James |author-link=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 30, 2009 |title=Halloween Comedy Watch: Who Wants a Chuckle? |url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2009/10/30/halloween-comedy-watch-who-wants-a-chuckle/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=November 3, 2009}}</ref> Not all reviews were positive.
