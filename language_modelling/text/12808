==Plot==
Beezus finds her younger sister Ramona's high spirits exasperating. She's embarrassed when they have to walk to the library together while Ramona wears her Easter bunny ears and hops like a rabbit. But when Ramona scribbles on every page of her library book, Beezus is really worried that her library card will be taken away.<ref name="Beezus and Ramona">''Beezus and Ramona'', Beverly Cleary, HarperCollins, 2010.</ref>

Another thing that exasperates Beezus is the fact that Ramona clearly has the best imagination. Beezus wants to impress Miss Robbins, her art teacher, and see one of her paintings tacked up in the middle of the room for everyone to enjoy. But when Miss Robbins asks them to paint an imaginary animal, Beezus has a terrible time coming up with an idea -- all she can thing of are ordinary animals like lions and giraffes. Then things go wrong, Ramona disrupts the class, and Beezus finds out she can be creative after all, just in her own unique way.<ref name="Beezus and Ramona">''Beezus and Ramona'', Beverly Cleary, HarperCollins, 2010.</ref>

Ramona even causes trouble for Beezus' friend [[Henry Huggins]], when he brings his dog, Ribsy, over to visit. Beezus is sure if her sister was more like Aunt Beatrice life would be better. After all, her Aunt and Mother always have fun together and get along very well. And Beezus loves her Aunt and is looking forward to having Aunt Beatrice over to celebrate her birthday. But first Ramona gets excited about having her own party and invites fifteen friends over -- without telling anyone -- and Beezus and her Mother really have to work together to get through the day.<ref name="Beezus and Ramona">''Beezus and Ramona'', Beverly Cleary, HarperCollins, 2010.</ref>

In the end Beezus does have her birthday party, with candles and cake and Aunt Beatrice to help celebrate. Then her Mother and Aunt start talking about the trouble they caused for each other when they were young, and Beezus learns something surprising about sisters. They may not always love each other, but once they're grown up, they can turn out to be quite nice after all.<ref name="Beezus and Ramona">''Beezus and Ramona'', Beverly Cleary, HarperCollins, 2010.</ref>

==Series==
Beezus' friend Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy originally appeared in their own series of six books, starting with ''[[Henry Huggins]]'' (1950). Beezus and Ramona were introduced in that book as friends of Henry who also lived on [[Klickitat Street]] in Portland, Oregon. 

In 1955 Cleary wrote <i>Beezus and Ramona</i>, the first in a new series about the Quimby sisters and their loving family.<ref name=Cleary>http://www.beverlycleary.com/books.aspx</ref> As of 2012 there were 8 books in the series. This is the only book written from Beezus' point of view, though she remains an important character throughout the series. 

The rest of the books focus on Ramona and are written from her point of view. She gets a year older in each book until, in the final volume, she celebrates her tenth birthday and is in the 4th grade.<ref name=Cleary>http://www.beverlycleary.com/books.aspx</ref>

==Critical reception==
"Beezus and Ramona act like children who live down the street. C(leary) is a masterful storyteller, who sees the humor in simple, childlike adventure. She is talented at developing a character through dialogue and behavior, and portrays children as they see themselves."<ref>The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Bernice E. Cullinan, Diane Goetz Person, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2001</ref>

"Ramona's complexity was something unusual in children's literature. Seen through the eyes of any other character, she could be a real nuisance. But when Cleary wrote from Ramona's point of view, all of the little girl's actions made perfect sense." Eric McHenry, Columns, UW Alumni Magazine, September 2008.<ref>http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/sept08/cleary.html</ref>
