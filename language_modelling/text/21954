'''Joseph Brown''', [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1918<U+2013>2009) was an [[Australian]] [[artist]] and [[art collector]].

Brown was born in [[Poland]] in 1918 and migrated to Australia in 1933 at the age of fifteen, settling in [[Melbourne]]. He trained initially as an artist but after returning from war service in 1945 became increasingly involved in the fashion industry. Later he became a leading [[art dealer]] and consultant, promoting a wide range of Australian artists, both historical and contemporary. He reclaimed the work of forgotten artists, introduced and mentored many new artists, and was a great advocate for portraiture as an art form. Simultaneously he built up an outstanding private collection of [[Australian art]].

In May 2004 Brown donated the major part of his incomparable collection of Australian art to the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] <U+2014> the most generous single gift of works of art ever made to a public gallery in Australia. Displayed at the Ian Potter Centre for [[Visual arts of Australia|Australian art]], The [[Joseph Brown Collection]] shows a wonderful display of a cross section of Australian art. Included are paintings from all major periods from colonial to [[Heidelberg]], to Aboriginal and twentieth century art. The collection is a tribute to the great generosity of Dr Brown and his exquisite taste in Australian art through many different eras.

When Brown offered his collection to the National Gallery of Victoria the Gallery selected more than 150 works, including paintings, sculptures and works on paper from colonial times to the present day. Dr Brown's extraordinary act of benefaction followed his gifts of over 450 works of art to Australian public galleries, including the National Gallery of Victoria, over the past forty years.

The Joseph Brown Collection at NGV Australia will forever tell the story of the immigrant who became an artist and soldier, a scholar and connoisseur, a successful businessman and an art dealer, a mentor to artists and an art patron; a man who made a huge and enduring difference to the culture of this country.
