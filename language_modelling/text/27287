By education, he is a political scientist from the [[University of Oslo]].{{cn|date=October 2012}} In the 1980s and 1990s he pursued a career in the civil service. In 1988 he was acting subdirector, and was promoted to subdirector, in the [[Ministry of Finance (Norway)|Ministry of Finance]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Statsr<U+00E5>d ble holdt p<U+00E5> Oslo slott 27. mai 1988|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=27 May 1988|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He later became acting head of department before being promoted to director in 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statsr<U+00E5>d ble holdt p<U+00E5> Oslo slott 31. januar 1992|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=31 January 1992|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Another promotion to deputy under-secretary of state in the [[Ministry of Social Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Social Affairs]] followed in 1993,<ref>{{cite news|title=Nytt fra statsr<U+00E5>d|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=30 April 1993|language=Norwegian}}</ref> before he reached the highest-ranking position in the civil service, permanent under-secretary of state, in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stokke departementsr<U+00E5>d i Sosialdepartementet|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=21 June 1996|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In 1999 he left the civil service to become chief executive of the pharmaceutical wholesaler Apokjeden. He cited a wage of {{NOK|700.000}} in the civil service as one of the reasons, deeming is to be too low, and adding that "The public sector is struggling with a leader wage problem. Something must happen here if one wants to keep people".<ref>{{cite news|title=Helsebyr<U+00E5>krat blir sjef for Apokjeden as|last=Strandhagen|first=Sverre|date=25 February 1999|work=Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv|page=19|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He chaired the board of the public real estate company [[Entra Eiendom]] from 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ny statlig eiendomsgigant|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=3 July 2000|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also chaired the [[National Library of Norway]] from 2001,<ref>{{cite news|title=Nasjonalbiblioteket f<U+00E5>r styre|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=11 June 2001|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but stepped down to board member at the end of 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blant Helse-Norges mektigste menn|last=|first=|date=9 April 2003|work=Aftenposten|page=5|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also chaired [[Statistics Norway]] and was a board member of the eyeglass retailer [[Brilleland]].<ref name=boards>{{cite news|title=Helse S<U+00F8>r-sjef trekker seg fra styreverv|last=Hafstad|first=Anne|coauthors=Gedde-Dahl, Siri|date=14 May 2003|work=Aftenposten|page=4|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In December 2001 it was announced that Stokke would be the new chief executive of the new [[Southern Norway Regional Health Authority]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Steinar Stokke blir direkt<U+00F8>r i Helse S<U+00F8>r|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=3 December 2001|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also became chair of five hospitals or [[health trust]]s in the Southern Norway Region; [[Rikshospitalet]], [[Radiumhospitalet]], [[Ringerike Hospital]], [[Buskerud Hospital]] and [[Telemark Hospital]]. In May 2003 he stepped down from the boards of four of the five hospitals (except Rikshospitalet) as well as Statistics Norway, the National Library and Brilleland. The reason was a flawed project where patient diagnoses was to be coded in different ways to be eligible for public funding.<ref name=boards/> In January 2004, the Southern Norway Regional Health Authority board chairman [[Oluf Arntsen]] tried to oust Stokke from the executive chair, following the "coding case" as well as roundhanded pension deals with company executives. Arntsen was supported by deputy chair [[Helen Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>y]] and board member [[Ole Johan Sandvand]], but was voted down by the rest of the board ([[Kaare Norum]], Einfrid Halvorsen, Anne Mo Grimdalen, Terje Keyn, Morten Falkenberg and Svein <U+00D8>verland). Arntsen subsequently had to resign, but in response, the Minister of Health [[Dagfinn H<U+00F8>ybr<U+00E5>ten]] promptly relieved the entire board of their positions.<ref name=oust>{{cite news|title=H<U+00F8>ybr<U+00E5>ten kaster Helse S<U+00F8>r-styret|last=Hafstad|first=Anne|coauthors=Gedde-Dahl, Siri|date=27 January 2004|work=Aftenposten|page=12|language=Norwegian}}</ref> An entirely new board was composed in early February, led by [[Erling Valvik]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Erling Valvik ny styreleder i Helse S<U+00F8>r|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=9 February 2004|language=Norwegian}}</ref> and after less than two weeks, Stokke resigned. He received a year's wage of about {{NOK|1.4 million}} and a one-off pension-in-advance of about {{NOK|1.6 million}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steinar Stokke f<U+00E5>r ett <U+00E5>rs etterl<U+00F8>nn|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=18 February 2004|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Asbj<U+00F8>rn Hofsli konstituert som direkt<U+00F8>r i Helse S<U+00F8>r|agency=Norwegian News Agency|date=18 February 2004|language=Norwegian}}</ref> A new chief executive was not found until December 2004, when [[Bj<U+00F8>rn Erikstein]] took over.<ref>{{cite news|title=Erikstein til Helse S<U+00F8>r|last=Grande|first=Arne|date=9 December 2004|work=Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv|page=31|language=Norwegian}}</ref>
