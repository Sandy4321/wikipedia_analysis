'''Marcus Whitman''' (September 4, 1802 &ndash; November 29, 1847) was an [[United States|American]] physician and [[Oregon missionaries|Oregon missionary]] in the [[Oregon Country]]. Along with his wife [[Narcissa Whitman]] he started a mission in what is now southeastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in 1836, which would later become a stop along the [[Oregon Trail]]. Whitman would later lead the first large party of [[wagon train]]s along the Oregon Trail, establishing it as a viable route for the thousands of emigrants who used the trail in the following decade.

==Early life==
On September 4, 1802 Marcus Whitman was born in [[Rushville, New York|Federal Hollow, New York]] to Beza Whitman and Alice Whitman.<ref name=nps>[http://www.nps.gov/archive/whmi/history/marcbio.htm National Park Service: Biography of Marcus Whitman]</ref> The family's heritage dates to John Whitman who immigrated to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] before 1639 from England.<ref name=nps/> After his father's death, when Whitman was seven years old, he moved to [[Massachusetts]] to live with his uncle.<ref name=nps/> He dreamed of becoming a minister but did not have the money for such a time-consuming curriculum. Instead, apprenticing himself, he studied medicine for two years with an experienced physician and received his degree from [[Fairfield Academy|Fairfield Medical College]].

==Missionary==
In 1834 Whitman applied to the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]].  They initially denied him for health reasons, but he was later accepted as a missionary doctor.  In 1835, he traveled with missionary [[Samuel Parker (missionary)|Samuel Parker]] to present-day northwestern [[Montana]] and northern [[Idaho]], to minister to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] bands of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]] and [[Nez Perc<U+00E9>]] Nations.  During this journey, Whitman treated several [[fur trapper]]s during an outbreak of [[cholera]].  At the end of their stay, he promised the Nez Perc<U+00E9> that he would return with other missionaries and teachers to live with them.

[[Image:Narcissa_Whitman.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Narcissa Whitman]]]]
After his return Whitman attended a speech by Samuel Parker, now representing the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which called for missionaries.  In 1836, Whitman married [[Narcissa Whitman|Narcissa Prentiss]], a teacher of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Narcissa had also been eager to travel west as a missionary, but she had been unable to do so as a single woman.

On May 25, 1836, the couple, and a group of other missionaries including [[Henry H. Spalding|Henry and Eliza Spalding]], joined a caravan of [[fur trader]]s and traveled west. The Fur Company caravan was led by [[Mountain man|mountain men]] [[Milton Sublette]] and [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]].  The fur traders had seven [[covered wagon]]s, each pulled by six [[mule]]s.  An additional cart drawn by two mules carried Milton Sublette, who had lost a leg a year earlier and walked on a "cork" leg made by a friend.  The combined group arrived at the fur-trader's rendezvous on July 6.  

The group established several missions as well as Whitman's own [[Whitman Mission|mission settlement]], Waiilatpu (Why-ee-lat-poo, the 't' is half silent), which means "place of the rye grass" in the [[Cayuse language]]. It was located just west of the northern end of the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]], and 6 miles from the present day city of [[Walla Walla, Washington]]. The settlement was in the territory of both the [[Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perc<U+00E9>]] tribes of Native Americans. Marcus farmed and provided medical care, while Narcissa set up a school for the Native American children. In 1843, Whitman travelled east, and on his return he helped lead the first large group of wagon trains west from [[Fort Hall]], in eastern Idaho. Known as the "Great Emigration", it established the viability of the Oregon Trail for later the homesteaders.

On March 14, 1837, on her twenty-ninth birthday, Narcissa gave birth to the first white American born in Oregon Country. Marcus and Narcissa named their daughter Alice Clarissa after her two grandmothers, and she would be their only natural child. Alice drowned in the [[Walla Walla River]] on June 23, 1839. Unattended for only a few moments, she had gone down to the river bank to fill her cup with water and fell in. Though her body was found shortly after she had fallen in, all attempts to revive her failed.<ref>Allen, Opal Sweazea. Narcissa Whitman: An Historical Biography. Binfords & Mort, 1959</ref>

==Massacres==
The influx of white settlers in the territory brought new diseases to the Indian tribes, including a severe epidemic of [[measles]] in 1847.  The Native American's lack of immunity to new diseases and limited health practices led to a high [[mortality rate]] or massacre, with children dying in striking numbers.  The zealous conversion attempts by the Whitmans, as well as the recovery of many white patients, fostered the belief among the Native Americans that Whitman was causing the death of his Indian patients.  

The Indian tradition of holding medicine men personally responsible for the patient's recovery eventually resulted in violence and another massacre.  In what became known as the [[Whitman Massacre]], Cayuse tribal members [[kill]]ed the Whitmans in their home on November 29, 1847.  Most of the buildings at Waiilatpu were destroyed.  Twelve other white settlers in the community were also killed.  For one month 53 women and children were held captive before negotiations led to them being released.  This event triggered an ongoing conflict between the occupying white settlers and indigenous local people known as the [[Cayuse War]].

According to some contemporaries, the situation was aggravated by ongoing animosity between the [[Protestant]] missionaries and local [[Catholic]] [[priest]]s.  Roman Catholic priest John Baptist Brouillet aided the survivors and helped bury the victims.  However, the Rev. Henry H. Spalding later wrote a pamphlet stating forcefully that the Catholic priests, including Father Brouillet, had incited the massacre. "Spalding's version of the disaster was printed and reprinted, sometimes at taxpayer expense, for the next half-century. It was finally discredited in 1901 by Yale University historian Edward Gaylord Brown. <ref>Edward Gaylord Brown, 'The myth of Marcus Whitman', in the ''American Historical Review'' of January 1901.</ref> <ref>[http://www.sentinel.org/history Online History of the Catholic Sentinel]</ref>
