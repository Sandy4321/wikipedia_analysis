The '''[[Boeing]] F3B''' was a [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[fighter bomber]] that served with the [[United States Navy]] from 1928 into the early 1930s.
{{TOClimit|limit=2}}
==Design and development==
Designed by the company as its '''Model 74''', the plane was an incremental improvement over the [[Boeing F2B|F2B]]. The Navy-designated prototype '''XF3B-1''' still had the tapered wings of the [[Boeing F2B|F2B]] for instance, but was built as a single-float [[seaplane]] using the [[Boeing Model 15|FB-5]] undercarriage. However, the growing use of [[aircraft carrier]]s took away most of the need for floating fighters, and by the time other test results had been taken into account, the production F3B-1 ('''Model 77''') had a larger upper wing that was slightly swept back and a redesigned tail with surfaces made from corrugated aluminum.<ref name="USN">Jones 1977, pp. 60<U+2013>62.</ref> It also eliminated the spreader bar arrangement of the undercarriage and revised the vertical tail shape.<ref name="world">Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 319.</ref>

==Operational history==
It first flew on 3 February 1928, turning in a respectable performance and garnering Boeing a contract for 73 more. F3Bs served as [[fighter-bomber]]s for some four years with the squadrons [[VF-2B]] aboard [[USS Langley (CV-1)|USS Langley]], [[VB-2B]] aboard [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|USS Saratoga]] (later [[VF-6B]]), and [[VB-1B]] on [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS Lexington]],<ref name="eleven"/><ref name="world"/> during which period some were fitted with [[Townend ring]]s and others with streamlined wheel fairings.<ref name="USN"/>The aircraft remained in first-line service to 1932 and were then retained as "hacks" (command and staff transports) for several more years.<ref name="world"/>
