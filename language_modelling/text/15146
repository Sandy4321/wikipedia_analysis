==Biography==
Rynearson was born in [[Three Oaks, Michigan|Three Oaks]], [[Berrien County, Michigan|Berrien County]], [[Michigan]].  He was the son of Isaiah Rynearson and Grace Ann McCarten.  He attended Michigan State Normal College from 1910&ndash;1914 and played for the football, baseball, and basketball teams. He was the captain of the basketball team his junior and his senior year, during which time the team achieved a record of 17-8.<ref name="BBall hist">{{cite web |url=http://www.emueagles.com/custompages/mbball/2009MediaGuide/8-Records.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-23 |title=2009-10 EMU Traditional Men's Basketball Media Guide |page=108 |section=Through the Years}}</ref> Eastern Michigan University records also list Rynearson as the basketball team captain for the 1916-1917 season, in which the team's record was 15-1.<ref name="BBall hist"/>

Rynearson played three years of minor league baseball from 1913 to 1915 for the [[Kalamazoo Kazoos]] in the Southern Michigan League (1913&ndash;1914) and the [[Brantford Red Sox]] in the Canadian League (1915).<ref>{{cite news|title=Elton Rynearson profile|publisher=baseball-reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=rynear001elt|accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>

The 1916 Michigan State Normal College yearbook, The Aurora, lists Rynearson as an assistant coach of the football team, and he assumed head coaching responsibilities in 1917. Over the course of his career, he coached at least one year in every varsity sport at Michigan State Normal, including football, basketball, baseball and track.<ref name=Obit2/> In 28 years as the head football coach, Rynearson compiled a record of 114&ndash;58&ndash;15.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elton J.

Between 1925 and 1927, his teams compiled a record of 22&ndash;1&ndash;0 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 405 to 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern Michigan Yearly Results|publisher=College Football Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/eastern_michigan/yearly_results.php?year=1925|accessdate=2010-04-23}}</ref>  In 17 years as the basketball coach, he compiled a record of 141&ndash;100.  During a four-year stretch from 1917 to 1921, he led the basketball team to a combined record of 48&ndash;9, including a one-loss season in his first year as the coach. He also served as athletic director from 1948 to 1963.

Rynearson continued to live in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]] in his later years.  In November 1966, the National Football Foundation awarded him the Willie Heston Award, given each year to an individual personifying the leadership qualities developed by football.<ref name=Obit/>

Rynearson suffered a heart attack on January 28, 1967, and died one week later at St. Joseph Hospital in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref name=Obit2>{{cite news|title=Former Coach at EMU Dies Wed.|newspaper=The Record-Eagle (Traverse City, MI)|date=1967-02-09}}</ref>  His funeral was held at St. John's Catholic Church in Ypsilanti.<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=E.J.

In September 1969, Eastern Michigan dedicated its new football stadium as [[Rynearson Stadium]].  The [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan football]] program has played its home games at Rynearson Stadium since the 1969 season. In 1976, Rynearson was posthumously named one of the inaugural members of the Eastern Michigan University Athletic Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emueagles.com/custompages/mbball/2009MediaGuide/5-University.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-23 |title=2009-10 EMU Traditional Men's Basketball Media Guide |page=80 |section=E-Club Athletic Hall of Fame}}</ref>

From 1925 through 1927 they outscored opponents 405 points to 31 and registered 19 shutouts.
