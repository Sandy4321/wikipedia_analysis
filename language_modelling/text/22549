The '''Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento''' was a September 5, 1975 effort by [[cultist]] [[Charles Manson|Charles Manson Family]] member [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]] to kill [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]] in [[Sacramento, California|California]] to set an example to those refusing to halt [[environmental pollution]] and its effects on Air, Trees, Water, and Animals ([[ATWA]]). Although Fromme stood a little more than an arms length from Ford that Friday morning and pointed a [[M1911 pistol]] at him while Ford was in [[California State Capitol Museum#Capitol Park|a public park]] surrounding the California State Capitol building, Fromme's gun failed to fire and no one was injured. For her crime, Fromme spent 34 years in prison and was released on August 14, 2009 - 2 years and 8 months after Ford's death. After the assassination attempt, Ford continued his walk in the park to the California state house, where he met with [[Jerry_Brown#Governor_of_California_.281975.E2.80.931983.29|California governor Jerry Brown]]. Ford later received the [[M1911 pistol]] used in the assassination attempt as a gift, and the gun was put on display at the [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].
