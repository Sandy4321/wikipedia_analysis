==History==
Dick Boushey, a [[cherry]] and [[apple]] grower first planted Boushey Vineyard with [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] in 1980--three years before the [[Yakima Valley]] was recognized as an [[American Viticultural Area]]. Boushey Vineyard was located in a cooler region of the Yakima Valley and the grapes grown here soon earned distinction for the unique ''[[terroir]]'' they exhibit that was different from grapes grown in the warmer [[Red Mountain (AVA)|Red Mountain]] to the west and [[Wahluke Slope (AVA)|Wahluke Slope]] to the north. At the request of [[Rhone Ranger]] winemaker [[Doug McCrea]] of [[McCrea Cellars]], Boushey began planted [[Rhone (wine)|Rhone]] [[varietal]]s and was one of the earliest Washington vineyards to grow Syrah.<ref name="Gregutt pg 85-86"/>

===Opposition to the Rattlesnake Hills AVA===
Boushey Vineyard is located among the [[Rattlesnake Hills]] but when part of the Rattlesnake Hills west of his vineyard was proposed as an American Viticultural Area, Dick Boushey was in opposition to the plan.<ref> Shannon Dininny "''[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060222&slug=webrattlesnake22 New wine grape-growing region recognized]"'' Seattle Times. Febuary 22nd, 2006 </ref> Boushey argued that the area did not have distinctive ''terroir'' that would merit an AVA stating ''"I know of no regional style, specific variety or type of wine that is unique to this proposed area. The granting of this proposal would confuse consumers and undermine the existing Yakima Valley Appellation."''<ref>Howard G Goldberg ''"[http://www.decanter.com/news/wine-news/487272/new-ava-for-washington New AVA for Washington]"'' Decanter Magazine.
