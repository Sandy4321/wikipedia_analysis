'''Didier Yves Drogba T<U+00E9>bily''' (born [[March 11]], [[1978]] in [[Abidjan]], [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]]) is a [[football (soccer)|footballer]] from [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]] who currently plays for [[Chelsea FC]] the [[English Premier League]]. He is currently top scorer of the current footballing season in both the [[English Premier League]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Abidjan]] on [[11 March]] [[1978]], Didier Drogba spent his childhood in his hometown [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]] and his adopted , [[France]]. <U+2018>Tito<U+2019>, as he was known to friends and family, first left the country of his birth at the age of five. He headed for [[Brest, France|Brest]] in [[Brittany]], where his uncle, Michel Goba, was a professional footballer. Drogba spent three years there with his uncle, living in [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Angoul<U+00EA>me]] and [[Dunkirk|Dunkerque]], before returning home.

Following a downturn in economic conditions, he returned to live with his uncle in Dunkerque, though he continued to move around France as a youngster. It was at this time that he began to play football. In 1991 his parents also travelled to France, moving to [[Vannes]] and at the age of fifteen Drogba signed for [[Levallois-Perret|Levallois]] F.C. At the time he was living with his cousin, [[Olivier T<U+00E9>bily]], who now plays for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. Drogba rose through the ranks at Levallois, playing for them in [[Ligue 2]] aged 18.

==Career==
===Le Mans and Guingamp===
Drogba signed for [[Le Mans UC72|Le Mans]] in 1998 (aged 19), who at the time were also in Ligue 2. After achieving a professional contract, he had a respectable first season, scoring seven goals. His next two seasons were dogged by injury, though his potential was clearly noted by [[En Avant Guingamp]], who signed him in 2002, taking him up to [[Ligue 1]] (aged 24).
Drogba spent one and a half seasons at Guingamp, scoring in his first game and repaying the manager's ([[Guy Lacombe]]) faith in him. In his only full season with the club, Drogba scored seventeen goals and helped Guingamp finish seventh, a record high for them. This led to him signing for [[Olympique de Marseille]], one of France's biggest clubs.

===Olympique de Marseille===
Marseille initially struggled, with [[Alain Perrin]], who signed Drogba from [[Guingamp]], being soon replaced by Jos<U+00E9> Anigo. However, Drogba was a consistent performer, scoring 19 goals and winning the award for French player of the year. He also collected a [[UEFA Cup]] runner's up medal, Marseille losing to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the final. Again he attracted attention from bigger clubs with a string of good performances (most notably in the [[UEFA]] cup against Newcastle where he scored two goals including a cleverly orchestrated corner). At the end of the season he moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as the club's then record signing for <U+00A3>24 million, before the arrival of [[Andriy Shevchenko]] for around <U+00A3>30 million in the summer of 2006.

===Chelsea===
Signing for Chelsea in July [[2004]], Drogba adapted well to the [[FA Premier League]], scoring in his third game for the club with a thunderous header against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. His season was interrupted when he pulled a stomach muscle against Liverpool, which kept him out of action for over two months. Despite this he enjoyed the second best goals-to-minutes ratio in the Premier League, [[Thierry Henry]] being the only player to better him in this respect. He scored 16 goals in 40 games for Chelsea in his first season, but was criticized for being inconsistent.  

The season proved very successful for Chelsea as they won the Premiership, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years, and the [[Football League Cup|Carling Cup]], with Drogba scoring in extra time in a 3-2 final win against Liverpool at the [[Millennium Stadium]]. He played an important part in his team's run to the semi-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], where he scored a brace against ex-club Marseille's arch-rivals [[Paris Saint-Germain]] and another two goals in both legs of the quarter-final against [[Bayern Munich]].

====2005-06====
Drogba made an impressive start to the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]] season, scoring two goals in a [[FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] win over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. In both goals, Drogba mercilessly exploited the mistakes of young Swiss defender [[Philippe Senderos]]. He also put in man-of-the-match performances in two 4-1 wins, one against Liverpool at [[Anfield]], where he had a part in creating every goal, and another against [[West Ham United]], where he scored the first, provided the second for [[Hern<U+00E1>n Crespo]], and played excellently throughout.

Drogba was accused of cheating during Chelsea's 2-0 win over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], during the 2005-06 season. He appeared to control the ball with his hand, before scoring the second of his two goals. In a post match interview with the [[BBC]], he acknowledged that he had handled the ball and seemingly admitted to cheating, saying, "Sometimes I [[Diving (football)|dive]], sometimes I stand," before immediately retracting his comment: "I don't dive, I play my game."<ref>{{cite news

Chelsea went on to retain the league title with two games to play, becoming only the second team to win back-to-back English Premier League championship titles. Ultimately, Drogba finished the 2005-06 season as the top assist provider in the Premier League, with 11 assists according to Actim Stats.

On [[June 11]] [[2006]], Drogba, who had previously disclosed that he wanted to return to Marseille because he had been demonised by the English media, said that he was ready to extend his contract at Chelsea and looked forward to playing with new team-mates [[Michael Ballack]], [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Salomon Kalou]] and [[Mikel John Obi]]. 

Furthermore, after the departure of fellow striker [[Hern<U+00E1>n Crespo]] and winger [[Damien Duff]], and manager Mourinho's decision to switch to a 4-4-2 formation after fielding a 4-3-3 featuring only one out-and-out forward over the past two seasons, Drogba's position in the coming season looked more stable as the first choice striker alongside [[Andriy Shevchenko]].

====2006-07====
After the departure of [[Damien Duff]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt he had worn for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff, which he also wears for his national team. As of February [[2007]], Drogba is currently having a successful season, having scored 25 goals in all competitions for Chelsea and is also top in the Premier League goal-scoring charts with 17 goals as of February 25, 2007, helping to keep Chelsea in touch with [[Manchester United]]. A diving header on the end of a cross from [[Wayne Bridge]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] opened the floodgates, and was followed by a solo goal against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]], an instinctive effort against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], a twenty yard volley in a 1-0 victory over [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]], and a crucial goal poked in against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Drogba also earned a second-half penalty in Chelsea's first [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] game of the season, a 2-0 home victory over [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]].

His rich vein of form continued in the Champions League, against Bulgarian side [[Levski Sofia]] when he gave Chelsea their first 2006 away win in Europe by scoring his first Chelsea [[hat-trick]], Chelsea<U+2019>s first UEFA Champions League hat-trick, and the first European hat-trick by a Chelsea player since [[Gianluca Vialli]]'s in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] 1997. On October 18 in the 46 minute Drogba received a pass from [[Ashley Cole]] and scored the winning goal against [[FC Barcelona]] in their group match at Stamford Bridge. In the reverse fixture on [[31 October]] [[2006]], Drogba scored a 93rd minute equaliser which started from a [[Michael Essien]] cross directed to [[Chelsea FC]] skipper [[John Terry]] who in turn headed it back to Drogba at the [[Nou Camp]] to earn Chelsea a 2-2 draw against Barcelona.

On [[November 3]] [[2006]] he committed his future to the club by signing a new four year deal. His first goal since signing his new contract was the fourth goal in Chelsea's 4-0 romp over [[Aston Villa]] in the 4th round of the 2006/2007 [[Carling Cup]]. 

On [[December 17]] [[2006]] he extended his goal tally to 16 goals, 10 of which came in the Premier League, by stabbing home Chelsea's winner against [[Newcastle United]] and scoring with a spectacular dipping volley from 35 yards out against [[Everton F.C.]]. He also scored  another crucial goal to ensure Chelsea's progression to the semi-finals of the [[Carling Cup]], again coming on as a match-winning sub against [[Newcastle United]] to "blast home a superb 78th-minute winner".<ref>{{cite news

After a brace against [[Reading F.C.]] on Boxing Day, Drogba reached the 20-goal milestone on [[December 30]], [[2006]], when he scored in Chelsea's 2-2 home draw with Fulham.

In January 2007 Drogba was crowned the Ivorian Player of the Year, beating off opposition from such players as Lille's [[Kader Keita]], Lens' [[Aruna Dindane]], and Arsenal's [[Kolo Toure]]. As of [[February 25]], [[2007]] Drogba's tally has reached 28 for the season in all competitions after netting two goals against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[Football League Cup Final 2007]] on [[February 25]], [[2007]].

===International===
Drogba is a [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire national football team|C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]] international and helped the team qualify for its first ever [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] Finals, held in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Germany in 2006]]. He scored nine goals in eight qualifying games - statistically one of the best records in international football. In February [[2005]] he was voted runner-up to [[Samuel Eto'o]] in the [[African Footballer of the Year]] awards. He has scored 24 times in 34 [[cap (sport)|caps]], as of June 17, 2006.

In February [[2006]], Drogba captained C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire to their second [[African Nations Cup|African Cup of Nations]] final, scoring the only goal in their semi-final match with [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] and putting away the deciding spot-kick in their record-equalling 12-11 penalty shootout quarter-final win over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]]. However, they lost in the final to [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] 4-2 on penalties after a 0-0 draw, with Drogba missing a penalty in the shoot-out.

In the 2006 World Cup, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire was drawn in a "[[group of death]]" with [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. On [[June 10]] [[2006]], Drogba scored the first [[World Cup]] goal of his career and of his country's history in the opening game against Argentina, but his team lost 2-1. At the post-match press conference, Drogba praised his team-mates for a good overall performance (singling out [[Bakari Kone]] and [[Didier Zokora]] in particular), but said that he and his team-mates have to work at cutting out mistakes and becoming better organised. "The difference between big teams like Argentina and small teams like us," Drogba said, "is that the big teams make the small teams pay for their mistakes. When you play opponents like Argentina, when you make little mistakes, you pay." 

C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire were eliminated from the World Cup after their next game, a 1-2 defeat to [[the Netherlands]], but came from 0-2 down to beat Serbia and Montenegro 3-2 in their final group game, with Drogba watching from the sidelines following suspension. Drogba was seen celebrating wildly with his Ivorian teammates in the dugout at the final whistle. He later told German television that he was "immensely proud" of his teammates, and felt that the team had done Africa proud, especially by demonstrating resolve and refusal to accept defeat.

In February 2007, Drogba was appointed as [[UNDP]] [[Goodwill Ambassador]] <ref>http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/january-2007/drogba-goodwill-20070124.en</ref>
