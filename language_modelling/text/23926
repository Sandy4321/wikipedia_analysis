'''Larry Hoover''' (born [[November 30]] [[1950]], [[Jackson, Mississippi]]) was the leader of the Chicago-based [[Gangster Disciples]] gang (also known as the '''Gangster Disciple Nation''' or '''GDN''').

==Early Years==
After moving to Chicago with his family in [[1955]], Hoover joined a gang of 50 older youths called the ''High Supreme Gangsters'' {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. They hung around the corner of 68th and Green Street in the [[Englewood, Chicago|Englewood]] neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago where Hoover lived. Hoover was kicked out of high school on the first day of his sophomore year after being shot in the thigh by a rival gang member in [[1965]].

==The Gangster Disciples and the Folk Nation==
In [[1974]], after the death of David Barksdale, Hoover was appointed the new president of the Black Gangster Disciple Nation. Two years later, Jerome "Shorty" Freeman (who was a candidate for the Nation's presidency) left the BGDN, making the Black Disciples and the Black Gangster Disciples separate organizations.  Even in prison, Hoover seemed to have great influence.  On [[July 22]], [[1978]], an inmate riot at the [[Pontiac Correctional Center]] in Illinois resulted in the death of three corrections officers.  This uprising was rumored to have been ordered by Hoover. 18 inmates were indicted; ten were acquitted after an 11-week trial.  Charges against Hoover and seven others were eventually dropped.

Hoover is also responsible for the creation of the Chicago-based [[Folk Nation]], which was formed in a similar manner to that of the Gangster Nation.  Again, Hoover had great influence while behind bars, as the [[1980s]] was a period of rapid growth for the Folk Nation.  While incarcerated at the [[Vienna Correctional Center]] in Vienna, Illinois, Hoover was observed "walking around in sweaters, neatly pressed trousers, argyle socks and $300 alligator-skin loafers."[http://www.emergency.com/gangprsn.htm]

==Operation Headache==
In [[1995]], the government launched Operation Headache with the goal of hurting the group's leadership and crippling their operations.  Agents from the FBI, CIA, DEA, the Illinois Department of Corrections, and local police were mobilized for five years. On [[August 31]], [[1995]], Hoover was arrested at Vienna by federal agents. Thirty-eight other Gangster Disciples were also arrested. The trials were held in three groups; the trial of Hoover's group began on [[March 19]], [[1997]]. Wiretaps of Hoover's conversations that were obtained in prison via a badge worn by his visitors were presented in court. On [[June 18]], [[1998]], Hoover was sentenced to six life terms, seven terms of 20 years, three four-year terms, and one five-year term under federal mandatory sentencing guidelines, with all sentences
running concurrently and in addition to the 150-200-year sentence he received for his 1973 murder conviction.[http://www.abtassociates.com/reports/D19980404.pdf]

Hoover is currently serving his sentence at the [[ADX Florence|United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX)]] in Florence, Colorado.
