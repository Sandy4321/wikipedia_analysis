'''Cerococcidae''' is a family of [[scale insect]]s commonly known as '''ornate pit scales''' or '''cerococcids'''. There are seventy two species in three genera. Members of this family occur in all regions of the world.<ref name=barc>{{cite web |url=http://www.sel.barc.usda.gov/ScaleKeys/ScaleFamilies/key/Scale%20Families/Media/Html/ScaleFamilies/Families/Cerococcidae/Cerococcidae.html |title=Cerococcidae |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]] |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}</ref>

== Description ==
Adult females produce a protective waxy [[test]] that shields their body. The tests are mostly creamy or varying shades of brown but some species have orange, yellow, red, pink or white. Male tests are smaller and narrower than those of the females and are developed in the second [[instar]]. Species in the genera ''[[Asterococcus (insect)|Asterococcus]]'' and ''[[Solenophora]]'' incorporate the shed skin of the first instar in their test. The second instar females are believed to develop tests in these genera but in ''[[Cerococcus]]'' it is the third instars that do so.<ref name=barc/>

== Life cycle ==
Ornate pit scales have three instar stages in the females and five in the males. In the United States, where a few species of ''Cerococcus'' have been studied, there is a single generation each year and the eggs overwinter inside the female test. They hatch in the spring and emerge through a small hole at the back. These first instars are ambulatory and disperse around the host plant. Second instars appear early in the summer and adults towards the end of summer, with egg-laying taking place in the autumn. Males occur in most species.<ref name=barc/>
