==Architecture==

The tower is constructed in [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] and the rest of the church in [[rubble]] sandstone.  The roofs of the chancel and chapel are in stone slate.  Its plan consists of a west tower, a partly ruined five-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] nave, and a chancel with a north chapel.<ref name=hg/>  The truncated tower has two stages.<ref name=hg/>  In the lower stage is a small west window, and in the upper stage are two-light bell openings.  Only the south wall of the nave remains.  This has a central protruding doorway flanked by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s, and round-arched windows without [[tracery]] or glass.  The chancel has a central south door with a [[cartouche]] above it, on each side of which are two-light round-headed windows.  Both the chapel and the chancel have three-light windows.  On the north wall are a two-light and a three-light window, while on the west wall are two three-light windows.  Inside the chancel is a chancel arch and a two-bay [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]].  There are a number of memorials, the most important of which are to the [[Earl of Strafford|Earls of Strafford]] and other members of the Wentworth family.  Other fittings have been removed.  In the west end of the chancel are steps leading down to the Fitzwilliam [[Burial vault (tomb)|vault]].<ref name=hg/>
