'''John McIntosh''' (born [[November 1]], [[1943]]) is a former [[Australian rules]] footballer who played for [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] in the [[Australian Football League|VFL]] and [[Claremont Football Club|Claremont]] in the [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]]. He is the father of West Coast footballer [[Ashley McIntosh]] and son of Dave McIntosh who played with East Perth. 

McIntosh was a ruckman and played with Claremont from 1962 to 1969, winning their best and fairest award twice. He represented Western Australia 17 times at interstate football and was [[All Australian]] in 1966 and 1969. In the 1966 Hobart Carnival he was awarded the [[Simpson Medal]].

He was lured to Victoria in 1970 to join St Kilda and had a successful debut season in the VFL, finishing equal 5th in the Brownlow Medal count. He improved on that the following season with an equal 2nd placing in the count, missing out on the Brownlow by three votes. In the 1971 Semi Final he injured his knee and couldn't play in the Grand Final against Hawthorn which the Saints lost. Further knee problems in 1972 saw him announce his retirement.
