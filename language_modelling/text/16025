'''Navenby''' ({{pronEng|ne<U+026A>v<U+0259>nbi}}) is a village and [[civil parish]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]. Lying {{convert|8.7|mi|km|0|lk=on}} south of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and {{convert|8.9|mi|km|0}} north-northwest of [[Sleaford]], Navenby has a population of 1,666 and is a [[dormitory village]] for Lincoln. It forms part of the [[North Kesteven]] local government district.

A [[Bronze Age]] cemetery has been discovered in the village, as well as the remains of an [[Iron Age]] settlement. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the [[Roman roads|Roman]] [[Ermine Street]], as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or [[garrison]] in the village. Navenby became a [[market town]] after receiving a [[Royal Charter|charter]] from [[Edward the Confessor]] in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by [[William Rufus]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. When the market fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.<ref name="ermine street"/>

The civil parish of Navenby is [[rural]], covering more than {{convert|2100|acre|sqkm}}. It straddles Ermine Street, a Roman road built between 45 and 75&nbsp;AD, which runs between [[London]] and [[York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A26655573|title=Ermine Street, A Journey through Roman Britain|accessdate=2008-03-30 |author=BBC|year=2007-09-24}}</ref> The [[Viking Way]], a 147-mile (237&nbsp;km) footpath between the [[Humber Bridge]] in North Lincolnshire and [[Oakham]] in [[Rutland]], also cuts through the village. The [[Vikings]] exerted great influence over Lincolnshire in the 9th and 10th centuries, as can be seen in the many local place names ending in ''-by'', such as Navenby. Names ending with ''-by'' meant [[Smallholding|homestead]] or [[village]].

=== Middle Ages ===

Navenby, originally an agricultural village, became a [[market town]] after receiving a [[Royal Charter|charter]] from [[Edward the Confessor]] in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by [[William Rufus]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].<ref name="Lincolnlife"/><ref name="ermine street">{{cite book |title=Bradshaw's Shilling handbook. Bradshaw's Illustrated Tourists |last=Bradshaw|first=George |year=1858 |publisher=Self published |pages=Page 102 }}</ref>

The wide main street, down which farmers once drove their sheep to market, is lasting evidence of its market town status. A market square once stood at the centre, marked by a cross in honour of [[Eleanor of Castile|Queen Eleanor]]. Today, the square has gone and the cross is a ruin.<ref name="towncharter">{{cite book |title=Abbeys, castles and ancient balls of England and Wales, their legendary lore |last=Timbs|first=John |year=1872 |publisher=Frederick Warne and Co |pages=Page 9 }}</ref><ref name="Lincolnlife"> {{cite magazine|url=http://www.lincolnshirelife.co.uk/pdfs/backpdfs/2005september/dyw.pdf|format=PDF| title=Down your way, Clifftop neighbours| accessdate=2008-03-30 |journal=Lincolnshire Life| last=Theobald| first=Judy| year=2005| month=September}}</ref>

Parish records exist for Navenby from 1681, although bishops' transcripts go back to 1562.<ref name="poorlaw"/> The documents show the village hosted several annual fairs each year: a market fair on [[17 October]] at which farm animals were traded; a feast on the Thursday before [[Easter]];<ref name="markettown">{{cite book |title=Curiosities of Great Britain: England and Wales Delineated, Historical |last=Dugdale|first=Thomas |year=1854 |publisher=L.

When the market closed in the early 19th century Navenby lost its status as a market town, and once again became an agricultural village. The ''[[Penny Cyclopaedia]]'' of 1839, published by The [[Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge]], described the village in this way:<ref name="penny">{{cite web| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TX7BmPgLuw8C&pg=PA13&dq=Navenby| title=Penny Cyclopaedia| publisher=Charles Knight| pages=Page 13| accessdate=2008-03-30| last=Knight| first=Charles| authorlink=Charles Knight (publisher)| year=1839}}</ref>

{{Quote|Navenby is in the hundred of Boothby Graffoe, parts of Kesteven, on the road from Grantham to Lincoln, 124&nbsp;miles [200&nbsp;km] from London.

The church is partly of Early English and partly of Decorated English architecture. The windows of the chancel are very fine specimens of Decorated character, particularly the east window, the mullions and tracery of which are remarkably graceful.

There were in 1833 two dame schools, with 18&nbsp;children; two day-schools, with 25&nbsp;children; and one endowed day and Sunday school, with 109&nbsp;children in the week and 166 on Sunday.}}

Many buildings were erected in Navenby during the 19th century, including a small [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] [[Methodist]] chapel in about 1830, which was completely rebuilt in 1840. A [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] Hall was built in 1852, later used as a second base by the Wesleyan Reformers.<ref name="navhist">{{cite book |title=History, gazetteer, and directory, of Lincolnshire, and the city and diocese |last=White|first=William |year=1882 |publisher=Elibron Classics |pages=Page 800 }}</ref>

A Volunteer Fire Brigade was founded in 1844, comprising five men and a manual engine. The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company began supplying gas lighting to the village in 1857, and in 1867 a railway station was built three-quarters of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) west of the village, on the Lincoln-to-[[Grantham]] branch of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].<ref name="Station">{{cite web| url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=13329| title=A vision of Britain through time, Place: Navenby Lincolnshire| accessdate=2008-03-30| author=Great Britain Historical GIS Project| work=A Vision of Britain Through Time}}</ref>

=== Modern history ===

Navenby was an agricultural village at the beginning of the 20th century, but the outbreak of the [[First World War]] brought changes for the community. A small [[airfield]], [[Wellingore]] Heath, was opened on land bordering Navenby in 1917, to provide a base for the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. The flat landscape, with its cliff-top situation, proved an ideal situation for flight operations.<ref name="welly">{{cite web| url=http://www.n-kesteven.gov.uk/section.asp?docId=3152| title=The Heath Walk| work=Leisure and Culture| accessdate=2008-03-30|author=North Kesteven District Council| date=2006-12-06}}</ref>

[[T. E.

That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows.

Wellingore airfield closed after the war ended, but it was re-opened in 1935 and its facilities were expanded during the winter of 1939&ndash;40. By then known as RAF Wellingore, notable officers stationed there include [[Group Captain]] [[Douglas Bader]] and [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]] &ndash; both regular visitors to Navenby.<ref name="welly2">{{cite web|url=http://raf-lincolnshire.info/wellingore/wellingore.htm|title=RAF Wellingore|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Raf Lincolnshire Information Service|month=August|date=2004}}</ref> The base served as a relief landing ground for [[RAF Cranwell]] from April 1944 until its final closure in 1945, after which it was used as a camp for [[prisoners of war]] from [[Germany]] and [[Ukraine]]; the inmates were often made to work on the surrounding farmland.<ref name="welly"/>

Navenby lost many men during the two World Wars. The village war memorial, a rough hewn stone [[Celtic Cross]] mounted on a plinth with a three-stepped base, is in the churchyard of St Peter's. It was manufactured by Messrs G Maile & Son Ltd at a cost of [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]200, and unveiled in April 1921. On it are inscribed the names of the 22&nbsp;casualties from the First World War and the 8 from the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Lincolnshire/Navenby.html|title=Roll of Honour &ndash; Navenby War Memorial|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Roll of Honour website, supported by The Ministry of Defence and The Royal British Legion|date=2002}}</ref><ref name="welly2"/>

Following an initial decline in the population of Navenby at the turn of the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply.<ref name="wnw"/> This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of [[the Great War]] until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_chart_page.jsp;jsessionid=32643FE2653D7F52BA8BB35223302A41?data_theme=T_HOUS&data_cube=N_HOUSE_TOT&u_id=10444305&c_id=10001043&add=Y|title= Navenby AP-CP: Total Houses|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=A Vision of Britain Through Time website}}</ref><ref name="lincs"/> Other [[post-war]] changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now largely a [[dormitory village]] for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.<ref name="lincs"/>

== Governance ==

The [[parish]] of Navenby was originally in the higher division of the ancient [[Boothby Graffoe]] [[wapentake]], in the [[North Kesteven]] division of the county of Lincolnshire. The term ''wapentake'' dates back to the Vikings and was used to describe a collection of local parishes. It originally meant "show your weapon" and the idea behind the term was that all those in favour of a resolution would raise their sword or axe to show agreement.<ref name="dictionary">{{cite book |title=A Topographical Dictionary of England |last=Lewis|first=Samuel |year=1848 |publisher=S.

{{Quote|The Wapentake of Boothby Graffoe is bounded on the north by ''Lawress'' wapentake; on the east by ''Lincoln Liberty'' and ''Langoe'' wapentake; on the south by ''Loveden'' wapentake; and on the west by Nottinghamshire. It is separated into High and Low Divisions. Through this wapentake a Roman road passes from Lincoln to Brough, a village just without the bounds of the county. The High division of the wapentake of Boothby Graffoe contains the villages of Boothby, Coleby, Harmston, Navenby, Skinnard, Swinethorpe, Welbourn and Wellingore. Navenby is formerly a market town. The living is a rectory, rated at <U+00A3>17 10s. 0d., and is in the patronage of the Master and Fellows of Christ Church College, Cambridge.}}

==Geography==

===Topography===

The civil parish of Navenby straddles the old [[Roman roads|Roman]] [[Ermine Street]], known locally as High Dyke.<ref name="NAG" /> The road runs between the neighbouring villages of [[Boothby Graffoe]] and [[Wellingore]] and covers more than {{convert|2100|acre|sqkm}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_theme_page.jsp?u_id=10444305&data_theme=T_POP|title=Navenby through time|accessdate=2008-03-30 |author=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |work=A Vision of Britain Through Time |date=2007}}</ref> The [[Viking Way]], a 147-mile (237&nbsp;km) footpath between the [[Humber Bridge]] in North Lincolnshire and [[Oakham]] in [[Rutland]], also passes through the village.<ref name="horncastlenews">{{cite news|url=http://www.horncastlenews.co.uk/walk-of-the-month/Cliffedge-villages-offer-a-dramatic.1894176.jp|title=Cliff-edge villages offer a dramatic and historic setting|accessdate=2008-03-30|work=Horncastle News |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |date=2006-11-23}}</ref>

Navenby is located at {{coor dms|53|11|31|N|2|26|35|W|city}} and known as a Lincolnshire Cliff Village, as it is situated on a ridge of [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]] called the Lincoln Edge or [[Lincoln Cliff]].

During the [[Ice Age]], most of the region surrounding Navenby was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the [[topography]] and nature of the soils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:6AkqnN-CzZ4J:www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID22.asp+ice+age%2Blincolnshire&hl=en&gl=uk&strip=0|title=Lincolnshire (including North and North East Lincolnshire)|work=England's Geology|accessdate=2008-03-30 |author=Natural England}}</ref> Much of Lincolnshire is low-lying, in some places below sea level, but Navenby's cliff-top position means it is 226&nbsp;ft (69&nbsp;m) above sea level, giving it commanding views over the [[River Witham]] valley.<ref name="benchmark">{{cite web|url=http://www.bench-marks.org.uk/bm1818|title=Flush Bracket 2094: Navenby|accessdate=2008-03-30 |author=Bench Mark Database |date=2005-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Countryside Character|volume=3: Yorkshire and the Humber| year=1998| isbn=0861704975| author=[[Countryside Commission]]| chapter=Northern Lincolnshire Edge with Coversands/Southern Lincolnshire Edge| chapterurl=http://www.countryside.gov.uk/Images/JCA45+47_tcm2-21144.pdf|format=PDF|  accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref>

[[Image:dialhouse.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Grade II listed Dial House, Navenby]][[Image:clintlane.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Clint Lane &ndash; Grade II listed housing]]

Although house prices have traditionally been lower than the national average in Navenby, they have risen quickly in recent years. In 2004, the average house price rose by 8.2% to <U+00A3>163,186, according to the Land Registry, while in 1999 the average was <U+00A3>60,000.<ref name="housing">{{cite web|url=http://www.n-kesteven.gov.uk/section.asp?docId=1912|title=Indices of Deprivation 2004|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Kesteven District Council |date=2004}}</ref>

The district surrounding Navenby &ndash; [[North Kesteven]] &ndash; remains a relatively inexpensive place to purchase property. Consequently, owner occupation is 77% &ndash; which is higher than both the regional and national averages. However, the rising prices of recent years are resulting in housing becoming increasingly "out of reach for those on average incomes".<ref name="housing"/> A 2004 Housing Needs Study, carried out by Fordham Associates for North Kesteven District Council, highlighted the need for 460&nbsp;"affordable homes" to be built each year for the next five years in Navenby and the surrounding villages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-kesteven.gov.uk/lsp/section.asp?catId=828|title=North Kesteven Local Strategic Partnership Housing, Navenby Housing|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Kesteven District Council |date=2007}}</ref>

Houses of specific interest in Navenby include [[Listed building|Grade II listed]] Dial House in North Lane, which has a priest's hidey hole,<ref>{{cite web|url=

Several of Navenby's street names hint at its past. For example, the street now known as Clint Lane was formerly Watery Lane, apparently due to the number of springs that ran along it. The only "watery" part of Clint Lane today is a duck pond. The street includes a mix of 18th-century cottages, Victorian properties, Grade II listed farm buildings and 20th-century homes.<ref name="navrecord">{{cite book |title=The Publications of the Lincoln Record Society |last=Society|first=Lincoln Record |year=1953 |publisher=Lincoln Record Society |pages=Page 59 }}</ref>

Gas Lane, which is next to Clint Lane, was originally called Meg's Lane. It was re-named Gas Lane after The Provincial Gas Light and Coke Company set up a base there in 1857. The firm later became the Navenby and Wellingore Gas Light and Coke Company. Although the business has long since disappeared, the street name still survives.<ref name="megnav">{{cite book |title=The Manuscripts of the Duke of Beauford, K. G.: The Earl of Donoughmore |last=Fitzroy|first=Henry |year=1891 |publisher=Printed for Her Majesty's Stationery Office, by Eyre and Spottiswoode |pages=Page 563 }}</ref>

The street now known as Church Lane was originally Church Street. The road was named for the village church, St Peter's, which is located here, as is a former village school, now a private house. The school was built by subscription in 1816 and carries the inscription "The Benefit Society 1821".<ref name="whitehistory"/>

===Climate===
According to the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen classification]], the [[British Isles]] experience a [[oceanic climate|maritime climate]] characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, Lincolnshire <U+2013> and Navenby <U+2013> are slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to Navenby's inland position, far from the landfall of most [[Atlantic]] depressions, it is one of the driest places to live in the UK, receiving, on average, less than 3&nbsp;ft (600&nbsp;mm) of rain per year.<ref name="avetemp">{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk/section.asp?docId=27136|title=Lincolnshire County Council, Climate and Weather|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=Lincolnshire County Council website|date=2008}}</ref> The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12&nbsp;minutes; the absence of any high ground is probably responsible for the area being one of the sunniest parts of the British Isles.<ref name="climate">{{cite web|url=http://weather.uk.msn.com/local.aspx?wealocations=wc:UKXX1087|title=Local Weather Forecast Lincoln, England|accessdate=2008-02-24 |author=MSN website}}</ref>

==Economy and media==
Navenby was originally an [[agricultural]] village, with most people living off the land or trading goods in the local market. Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture,<ref name="Station"/> but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the [[service industry]] and most commute to work away from Navenby.<ref name="lincs"/> The village does, however, offer some work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, a building society and a residential care home are in the village.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navenby.net/Councils/News.aspx|title=Navenby Parish Council News |accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Navenby.net website |date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulh.nhs.uk/ United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust|title=United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust |accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=NHS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhomeslincolnshire.co.uk/ndclocal.htm|title=Local amenities|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=New Homes website}}</ref>

Nearby Lincoln offers a wider variety of work, with its economy based mainly on [[government|public administration]], [[commerce]], arable [[farming]] and [[tourism]]. Over the past few years, Lincoln has also seen rapid development in its retail sector, in an attempt to compete with the neighbouring cities of [[Nottingham]] and [[Sheffield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=

==Landmarks==

The centre of Navenby village is a designated [[conservation area]]; many of the stone- and brick-built houses date back hundreds of years. More than 20 of the properties, as well as the 1935 red telephone kiosk in High Street, have [[listed building]] status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=456211|title=Images of England IoE Number:  456211|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Images of England}}</ref>

===Mrs Smith's Cottage===
[[Image:mrssmith1.JPG|thumb|Mrs Smith. To her left is her cottage and Navenby Methodist Church, where she was a member.]]

The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap &ndash; installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s &ndash; and an inside toilet. The original outside [[Outhouse|privy]] and washhouse can still be viewed.<ref name="mrssmith"/>

The cottage is named after its last resident, Mrs Hilda Smith, who lived there until 1995, when she was 102 years old. When Mrs Smith died, villagers mounted a campaign to ensure the cottage was kept as "something special" for Navenby.<ref name="mrssmith">{{cite web|url=http://www.oden.co.uk/mrssmith|title=Mrs Smith's Cottage

Today the cottage is run as a museum, having been granted official museum status in March 2000. It is open for much of the year and staffed by volunteers. The old pig sty and storage shed, deemed beyond repair, were demolished and the bricks used to construct a purpose-built visitor centre, used for exhibitions about Navenby and the local area.<ref name="mrssmith"/>

===St Peter's Church===
The Grade I listed Anglican parish church in Navenby is dedicated to [[Saint Peter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=192464|title=Images of England:IoE Number:  192464|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Images of England}}</ref> Despite parish registers existing from 1681, and Bishop's transcripts that go back to 1562, it is difficult to date the building as it has a mishmash of styles, although its origins are probably 13th century.<ref name="Bestchurch">{{cite book |title=England's Thousand Best Churches |last=Jenkins|first=Simon |year=1999 |publisher=Allen Lane |isbn=0713992816 |pages=Page 387 }}</ref>
[[Image:stpeternav.jpg|right|thumb|St Peter's Church today]]

St Peter's is made up of three parts, including a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859&ndash;60 after it fell down. The perpendicular [[clerestory]] is decorated with shields in [[quatrefoil]]s and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated [[chancel]] has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875&ndash;76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.<ref name="peters">{{cite book |title=An American's Guide to English Parish Churches|last=Betjeman|first=John |year=1959 |publisher=Dowell, Obolensky |pages=Page 245 }}</ref>

The [[sedilia]] and [[piscina]] are thought to date back to William de Herleston, who was rector of St Peter's from 1325&ndash;29. He was [[Edward I]]'s chancellor and later became Canon of Llandaff. A founder's tomb, which is in a slightly different style, is probably that of his successor, John de Fenton, who was rector until 1832. The [[Baptismal font|font]] is a lavish [[Victorian era|Victorian]] affair by Charles Kirk Junior, which was shown at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. The [[Pulpit]] is [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] and the [[Rood screen]] by Temple Moore dates from 1910. The Royal Arms are signed "Thomas Hunton of Lincoln. Painter 1710." There is a late 13th-century grave slab, with an inscription in [[Norman language|Norman]] script which says "Pray for Richard de Lue" ([[Louth]]).<ref name="Lincolnlife"/><ref name="Bestchurch"/><ref name="peters"/>

The church also contains an [[Easter]] [[sepulchre]].<ref name="towncharter"/> The carving is recognised as one of the finest in Lincolnshire, if not in the country, and receives a mention in virtually every book written on churches and their architecture.

In 1982, church officials threatened to close St Peter's Church after being refused permission to sell silverware to pay for urgent repairs. The Archdeacon, the Venerable Michael Adie, ruled that such sales were against church policy, and that funds must be raised locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skegnessstandard.co.uk/custompages/CustomPage.aspx?PageID=64678|title=St Peter's In Debt, Pages from the Past|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Skegness Standard |date=1982/2007}}</ref>

Navenby village lies at the eastern end of Navenby parish and is best accessed by road, as the [[A607]] trunk road passes through the heart of the village. Navenby can also be reached from the [[A15 road]], which runs past the end of [[Green Man]] Lane and links Lincoln with Sleaford.

The Grade II listed 18th-century King's Head is probably the oldest pub in the village, while the nearby Lion and Royal dates from 1824 and is Grade II listed as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=192476&mode=quick|title=Images of England, IoE Number:  192476|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Images of England website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=192479|title=Images of England, IoE Number:  192479|accessdate=2008-02-20 |author=Images of England website}}</ref> It is probable the pub was just called "The Lion" when first opened, but added "Royal" to the name in honour of a special visitor.
