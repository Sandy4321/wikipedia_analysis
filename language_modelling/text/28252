The Cumans were nomadic warriors of the [[Eurasia]]n [[steppe]] who exerted an enduring impact on the medieval Balkans. The basic instrument of Cuman political success was military force, which dominated each of the warring Balkan factionst. Groups of the Cumans settled and mingled with the local population in various regions of the Balkans. A Cuman origin for the founders of three successive Bulgarian dynasties ([[Asenids]], [[Terterids]], and [[Shishman dynasty|Shishmanids]]), and the founding Wallachian dynasty ([[Basarabids]]) has been proposed.<ref name="Istv<U+00E1>n V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry 2005"/> But, in the cases of the Basarab and Asenid dynasties, medieval documents refer to them as [[Vlach]] ([[Romania]]n) dynasties<ref>For example: "Bazarab infidelis Olahus noster", "Basarab Olacus et filii eiusden", "Bazarab filium Thocomerius scismaticum olachis nostris". http://www.arcanum.hu/mol/lpext.dll/fejer/152e/153a/1654?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0</ref><ref>Istv<U+00E1>n V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry (2005) ''Cumans and Tatars'', Cambridge University Press, p. 40: "No serious argument can be put forward in support of the Assenids' Bulgarian or Russian origin. Moreover, a Cuman name by itself cannot prove that its bearer was undoubtedly Cuman. Asen's Turkic name must be reconciled with the fact that the sources unanimously testify to his being Vlach."</ref><ref>Stephenson, Paul. ''Byzantium's Balkan Frontier: A Political Study of the Northern Balkans, 900-1204'', Cambridge University Press, 2000</ref> They also played an active role in Byzantium, Hungary, and Serbia, with Cuman immigrants being integrated into each country's elite. 

The Cumans were called ''Folban'' and ''Vallani'' by Germans, ''Kun'' (Qoun) by the Hungarians, and ''Polovtsy'' by the Russians - all meaning "blond". It is difficult to know which group past historians were referring to when they used the name Kipchak, as they could refer to the Cumans only, the Kipchaks only, or to both together. The two nations joined and lived together (and possibly exchanged weaponry, culture and fused languages). This confederation and their living together may have made it difficult at times for historians to write exclusively about either nation.

==Etymology==
A variety of sources from different countries (such as Germany, Hungary and Russia) explain that the different names for the Cumans may all refer to the meaning 'blond', 'sallow' and 'yellow', in reference to the color of the Kumans' hair. The Russian word 'Polovtsy' (<U+041F><U+00F3><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0446><U+044B>) means "blond", since the old Russian word "polovo" means "straw". "Kuman" means "pale yellow" in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]].

O. Suleymenov said their name referred to "men of the field, steppe" from the Russian word ''pole'' (open ground, field), not to be confused with ''polyane'' (cf. Greek ''polis'' - city). O. Suleymenov suggested that ''polovtsy'' came from a word for "blue-eyed," since the [[Serbo-Croatian]] word ''plav'' means "blue"<ref>{{cite book |title=ESSE English-Serbian Serbian-English Dictionary and Grammar |last=Ignjati<U+0107> |first=Zdravko |year=2005 |publisher=Institute for Foreign Languages |location=Belgrade, Serbia |isbn=867147122-5 |page=1033}}</ref>

The Cumans originally lived east of the Yellow River, in China,<ref>Istv<U+00E1>n V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry (2005) "Cumans and Tatars", Cambridge University Press</ref>. The Cumans entered the grassland of Eastern Europe in the 11th century, from where they continued to assault the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and [[Ancient Rus|Rus]] - they became arch enemies.

The vast territory of this Cuman-Kipchak realm, consisting of loosely connected tribal units who were the military dominating force, was never politically united by a strong central power. [[Cumania]] was neither a state nor an empire, but different groups under independent rulers, or khans, who acted on their own initiative, meddling in the political life of the surrounding states: the Russian principalities, Bulgaria, Byzantium and the Wallachian states in the [[Balkans]], [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (see [[Kipchaks in Georgia]]-but here we do not know if it was just Kipchaks, just Cumans, or Kipchaks and Cumans, discussed earlier) in the [[Caucasus]], and [[Khwarezm]], having reached as far as to create a powerful caste of warriors, the [[Mamluks]].

The Cumans first encountered the Rus in 1055; this resulted in a peace agreement. In 1061, the Cumans invaded and devastated the Rus Pereiaslav principality<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com">http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\C\U\Cumans.htm</ref>

In 1068, at the Alta River the Cumans defeated the armies of the three sons of Yaroslav the Wise<U+2014>Iziaslav Yaroslavych, Sviatoslav II Yaroslavych, and Vsevolod Yaroslavych. After the Cuman victory, they  repeatedly invaded Ukraine, devastating the land, and took captives who became either slaves or were sold at slave markets in the south. the Most vulnerable regions were the principalities of Pereiasla, Novhorod-Siverskyi and Chernihiv<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/>

In the Balkans, we find the Cumans in contact with all of the statal entities of that time, fighting with the Kingdom of Hungary, allied with the [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]], and involved into the politics of the fresh Vlach statal entities. A notable Cuman leader in Europe, Thocomer, apparently a Cuman warlord (because he is also known as [[Tihomir]] he might have been a Bulgarian noble, of mixed Cuman heritage, instead), was possibly the first one to unite the Romanian (Vlach) states from the west and the east of the [[Olt River]]. Tihomir's son [[Basarab]] ("Father king" in the [[Cuman language]]) is considered the first ruler of the united and independent kingdom of [[Wallachia]]. This interpretation corresponds with the general view of the situation of the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|Romanian]] lands in the 11th century, with the natives living in collections of village communities united in various small confederacies, with powerful chiefs competing to create small kingdoms. Some of these Romanian chiefs paid tribute to the various militarily dominant nomadic tribes that surrounded them.

[[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] defeated the Cumans after they attacked the Kingdom of Hungary in 1089.

In 1091 the [[Pechenegs]], a [[semi-nomadic]] Turkic people of the prairies of southwestern [[Eurasia]], were decisively defeated as an independent force at the [[Battle of Levounion]] by the combined forces of a [[Byzantine]] army under Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] and a Cuman army under Togortok and Bunaq. Attacked again in 1094 by the Cumans, many Pechenegs were again slain. The remnants of the Pechenegs fled to Hungary, as the Cumans themselves would do a few decades later: fearing the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]], in 1229, they asked asylum from [[B<U+00E9>la IV of Hungary]].

In alliance with the [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]]<ref>The meaning of the term "Vlach" in this case was the subject of fierce dispute in the late 19th and 20th centuries (see also [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria#Disputed origins|Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]).</ref><ref>As mention in the [[Robert de Clari]] Chronicle</ref> during the [[Vlach-Bulgar Rebellion]] by brothers Asen and Peter of [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], the Cumans are believed to have played a significant role in the rebellion's final victory over Byzantium and the restoration of Bulgaria's independence (1185).<ref name="name1">In his History of the Byzantine Empire, isbn13: 9780299809256, 1935, Russian historian A. A. Vasiliev concluded in this matter <U+201C>The liberating movement of the second half of the 12th century  in the Balkans was originated and vigorously prosecuted by the Wallachians, ancestors of the Romanians of today; it was joined by the Bulgarians, and to some extent by the Cumans from beyond the Danube <U+201C></ref> The Cumans were allies with Bulgaria's emperor [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]], who was also descended from the Cumans, in the [[Bulgarian-Latin Wars]].

Although the Cumans initially had managed to defeat the Great Prince [[Vladimir Monomakh]] of Kievan Rus in the 12th century (at the [[Battle of the Stugna River]]) later they were defeated by the combined forces of Russian principalities led by Monomakh and forced out of the Rus borders to Caucasus. Many Cumans at that time resettled into Georgia where they achieved prominent positions and helped Georgians to stop the advance of [[Seljuk Dynasty|Seljuk Turks]]. After the death of warlike Monomakh in 1125 Cumans returned to the steppe along the Rus borders.

Like most other peoples of medieval [[Eastern Europe]], they put up resistance against the relentlessly advancing [[Mongols]], led by Jebe and Subutai. The Mongols crossed the Caucasus mountains in pursuit of Muhammad II, the shah of [[Khwarazm]], and met and defeated the Cumans in Subcaucasia in 1220. The Cuman khans Danylo Kobiakovych and Yurii Konchakovych died in battle, while the other Cumans, commanded by Koten, managed to get aid from the Rus<U+2019> princes<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/>
As the Mongols were approaching Russia, Khan Koten fled to the court of his son-in-law, Prince Mstislav the Bold of Galich. He warned Mstislav: "Today the Mongols have taken our land and tomorrow they will take yours". However, the Cumans were ignored for almost a year as the Rus had suffered from Cuman raids for decades. But when news reached Kiev that the Mongols were marching along the Dniester River, the Rus responded. Mstislav gathered an alliance of the Kievan Rus' princes including Mstislav III of Kiev and Prince Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal, who promised support, together with Khan Koten's Cumans. The Rus princes then began mustering their armies and going towards the rendezvous point. The army of the allience of the Rus and Cumans numbered around 80000. The battle took place near Kalka River ([[Battle of Kalka River]]). Due to confusion from mistakes from the Rus and Cumans, the battle was lost - the Cumans and Rus were defeated (1223). The Cumans were finally crushed in 1238.
During the second Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in 1237 the Cumans were defeated again. Most of them surrendered to the Mongols, while the others followed Koten to Hungary and Bulgaria, where they became part of the local population; they were integrated into the elite and became nobles and rulers. 
Although the Cumans were defeated by the Mongols, the cultural heritage of the Cumans that remained in the Rus steppe (those who did not move to Hungary and Bulgaria) was transferred on to the Mongols. The Mongol elite adopted a lot of the traits, customs and language of from the Cumans and Kipchaks; the Cumans, Kipchaks and Mongols finally became assimilated through intermarriage and became the Golden Horde. The Cumans, together with the Turko-Mongols, adopted Islam, in the second half of the 13th and the first half of the 14th century.<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/>

Previously, in 1229, they had asked for asylum from King B<U+00E9>la IV of Hungary, who in 1238 finally offered refuge to the remainder of the Cuman people under their leader [[Kuthen]] (Hungarians spelled his name K<U+00F6>t<U+00F6>ny). Kuthen in turn vowed to convert his 40,000 families to Christianity. King B<U+00E9>la hoped to use the new subjects as auxiliary troops against the Mongols, who were already threatening Hungary. The king assigned various parts of central Hungary to the Cuman tribes. A tense situation erupted when Mongol troops burst into Hungary. The Hungarians, frustrated by their own helplessness, took revenge on the Cumans, whom they accused of being Mongol spies. After a bloody fight the Hungarians killed Kuthen and his bodygards, and the remaining Cumans fled to the Balkans. After the Mongol invasion B<U+00E9>la IV of Hungary recalled the Cumans to Hungary to populate settlements devastated by war. The nomads subsequently settled throughout the [[Great Hungarian Plain]]. Throughout the following centuries the Cumans in Hungary were granted various rights, the extent of which depended on the prevailing political situation. Some of these rights survived until the end of the 19th century, although the Cumans had long since assimilated with Hungarians.

The pontic [[Cumania]] (Latin term for Deshti-Kipchak, not the Cumania in modern day Romania and Moldova), ceased to exist in the middle of the 13th century, when the Great Mongol Invasion of Europe occurred. In 1223, [[Genghis Khan]] defeated the Cumans and their Russian allies at the [[Battle of Kalka River]] (in modern Ukraine), and the final blow came in 1241, when the Cuman confederacy ceased to exist as a political entity, with the remaining Cuman tribes being dispersed, either becoming subjects and mixing with their Tatar-Mongol conquerors as part of what was to be known as the Nogai Horde, or fleeing to the west, to the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

Cumans had served as mercenaries in the armies of the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the end of the 11th century and were one of the most important elements of the Byzantine army until the mid-14th century. They served as horse-archers and those in the central army were collectively called ''Skythicon''. In 1241, the Byzantines settled 10,000 Cumans in [[Thrace]] and [[Anatolia]] where they became [[hellenized]]. A Greek-speaking Cuman even became [[Domestikos#Grand Domestic|''Megas Domestikos'']] (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) under the Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]].<ref>"Byzantine Armies AD 1118-1461", p.23, Ian Heath, 1995 [[Osprey Publishing]], ISBN 978 1 855532 347 6</ref> 

The Cumans who remained scattered in the prairie of what is now southwest Russia joined the [[Golden Horde]] khanate and their descendants became assimilated with local [[Tatar]] populations.

The Cumans who remained east and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] established a county named Cumania, in an area consisting parts of [[Moldavia]] and [[Walachia]]. The Hungarian kings claimed supremacy on the territory of Cumania, among the nine titles of the Hungarian kings of the [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d dynasty|<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]] and [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasties were  ''rex Cumaniae''.

The Cuman influence in Wallachia and Moldavia was very strong, according to some historians who claim that the earliest Wallachian rulers bore Cuman names (Tihomir and Bassarab). This hypothesis is though disputed. In lack of convincing archaeological evidence of a Cuman civilisation, it appears the Cumans were just a minority within the local population, but they made up part of the ruling elite in Wallachia. As in the case of Bulgaria, they were assimilated by the majority, the present-day Romanians.

[[Basarab I]], son of the Wallachian prince [[Tihomir of Wallachia]] obtained independence from Hungary at the beginning of the 14th century. The name Basarab is considered by some authors as being of Cuman origin, and meaning "Father King".

It is generally believed by Bulgarian historians that the Bulgarian media<U+0435>val dynasties [[Asen dynasty|Asen]], [[Shishman dynasty|Shishman]] and [[Terter]] were Cumanian.

The Caucasian mummies found in China a while ago could have been Cumans, as it is stated that the Cumans originally came from eastern China before migrating to Europe.<ref name="Istv<U+00E1>n V<U+00E1>s<U+00E1>ry 2005"/>

==Codex Cumanicus==
The [[Codex Cumanicus]] was a linguistic manual of the Middle Ages, designed to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Cumans. It is currently housed in the Library of St. Mark, in Venice (Cod. Mar. Lat. DXLIX). Some parts from the The Codex [[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]] is shown below:

In English, the text is:
''Our Father which art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have done us evil. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. Amen.''

In Modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the text is:

[[File:Radzivill Chronicle Cumans.jpg|thumb|Cuman representation in the [[Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142> Chronicle]]]]
Robert de Clari described Cumans as nomadic warriors, who did not use houses, or farm, but rather lived in tents, and ate milk, cheese and meat. The horses had a sack for feeding attached to the [[bridle]], and in a day and a night they can ride seven [[Mansio|days of walking (Mansio)]], they go on campaign without any baggage, and when they return they take everything they can carry, they wear [[sheepskin]] and were armed with composite bows and arrows. They pray to the first animal they see in the morning.<ref>As mentioned in [[Robert de Clari]]'s chronicle.</ref><ref>Ovidiu Pecican Troia Venetia Roma</ref> The Cumans, like the Bulgars, were also known to drink blood from their horse (they would cut a vein) when they ran out of water and were far from an available source. Another interesting feature of the Cumans was their elaborate masks which they used in battle - they were shaped like and worn over the face. A typical feature were mustaches.

The main activity of the Cumans was animal husbandry. They raised horses, sheep, goats, camels, and cattle. In summer they moved north with their herds; in winter, south. Some of the Cumans led a semi settled life and took part in trading and farming. They mainly sold and exported animals, mostly horses, and animal products. The Cumans also played the role of middlemen in the trade between Byzantium and the East, which passed through the Cuman-controlled ports of Surozh, Oziv, and Saksyn. Several land routes between Europe and the Near East ran through Cuman territories: the Zaloznyi route, the Solianyi route, and the Varangian route. Cuman towns<U+2014>Sharukan, Suhrov, and Balin<U+2014>appeared in the Donets River Basin; they were inhabited, however, by other peoples besides the Cumans. Stone figures called Stone babas, which are found throughout southern Ukraine, were closely connected with the Cuman religious cult of shamanism. The Cumans tolerated all religions and Islam and Christianity spread quickly among them. As they were close to the Kyivan Rus<U+2019> principalities, the Cuman khans and impoertant families began to Slavicize their names, for example, Yaroslav Tomzakovych, Hlib Tyriievych, Yurii Konchakovych, and Danylo Kobiakovych. Ukrainian princely families were often connected by marriage with Cuman khans; this lessened wars and conflicts. Sometimes the princes and khans waged joint campaigns; for example, in 1221 they attacked the trading town of Sudak on the Black Sea, which was held by the Seljuk Turks and which interfered with Rus<U+2019>-Cuman trade.<ref name="encyclopediaofukraine.com"/>

A genetic study was done on Cuman burials within Hungary and it was determined that they had substantially more western Eaurasian mitochondrial DNA lineages.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=16596944}}</ref>

==Religion==
{{Main|Christianization of Kievan Rus'}}
The main religion was [[Tengriism]] centered around [[Tengri]] and [[Umay]]. The Kuman people were baptised in 1227 by R<U+00F3>bert [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] in a mass baptism in [[Moldavia]] on the orders of Bortz Khan, who swore allegiance to King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>Horv<U+00E1>th (1989), p. 48.</ref>

In the 13th century, the Western Cumans adopted [[Roman Catholicism]] (in Hungary they all later became [[Calvinist]]) and the [[Gagauzes]] [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], while the Eastern Cumans converted to [[Islam]]. The Catholic [[Diocese of Cumania]] founded in [[Milcov]] in 1227 and including what is now [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], retained its title until 1523.  It was a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]] in Hungary.

[[File:<U+041A><U+0443><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+0442><U+0443><U+0430> <U+0443> <U+0425><U+0430><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0443>.jpg|thumb|200px|Cuman sculpture in Kharkiv, Ukraine.]]
While the Cumans were gradually absorbed into eastern European populations, their trace can still be found in placenames as widespread as the city of [[Kumanovo]] in the Northeastern part of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]; a Slavic village named Kumanichevo in the Kostur (Kastoria) district of Greece, which was changed to ''Lithia'' after Greece obtained this territory in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, [[Com<U+0103>ne<U+015F>ti]] in [[Romania]], a village of [[Kumane]] in [[Serbia]], [[Comana, Constan<U+0163>a|Comana]] in [[Dobrogea]] (also [[Romania]]) and the small village of Kumanite in Bulgaria.

As the Mongols pushed westwards and devastated their state, most of the Cumans fled to the Bulgarian Empire as they were major military allies. The Bulgarian Tsar Ivan-Asen II (who was descended from Cumans) settled them in the southern parts of the country, bordering the Latin Empire and the Thessallonikan Despotate. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Those territories are in present-day Turkish Europe and the Republic of Macedonia. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
The Cumans also settled in Hungary and had their own self-government there in a territory that bore their name, [[Kuns<U+00E1>g]], that survived until the 19th century. There, the name of the Cumans (''Kun'') is still preserved in county names such as [[B<U+00E1>cs-Kiskun]] and [[J<U+00E1>sz-Nagykun-Szolnok]] and town names such as [[Kiskunhalas]] and [[Kunszentmikl<U+00F3>s]].

The Cumans were organized into four tribes in Hungary: Kolbasz/Olas in upper Cumania around Karcag, and the other three in lower Cumania.

Unfortunately, the Cuman language disappeared from Hungary in the 17th or 18th century (1770?), possibly following the Turkish occupation. Their 19th century biographer, Gy<U+00E1>rf<U+00E1>s Istv<U+00E1>n, in 1870 was of the opinion that they originally spoke Hungarian, together with the [[Iazyges]] population. Despite this mistake, he has the best overview on the subject concerning details of material used.

In addition, toponyms of [[Cuman language]] origin can be found in some Romanian counties of [[Vaslui County|Vaslui]] and [[Gala<U+0163>i County|Gala<U+0163>i]], including the names of both counties.

When some of the Cumans moved to Hungary, they brought with them their dogs - the [[Komondor]] dogs, which has become one of the national dogs of Hungary.

In the countries where the Cumans were assimilated, family surnames derived from the words for "Cuman" (such as ''coman'' or ''kun'', "kuman") are not uncommon. Traces of the Cumans are the Bulgarian surnames Kunev or Kumanov (feminine Kuneva, Kumanova), its Macedonian variants Kunevski, Kumanovski (feminine Kumanovska), and the widespread Hungarian surname Kun. The names "Coman" in Romania and its derivatives however do not appear to have any connection to the medieval Cumans, as it was unrecorded until very recent times and the places with the highest frequency of such names has not produced any archaeological evidence of Cuman settlement.<ref name="Spinei">Spinei, Victor. The Cuman Bishopric - Genesis and Evolution. in The Other Europe: Avars, Bulgars, Khazars and Cumans. Edited by Florin Curta and Roman Kovalev. Brill Publishing. 2008. p. 64</ref>

The Cumans appear in Rus culture in ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'' and are the Rus' military enemies in [[Alexander Borodin]]'s [[opera]] ''[[Prince Igor]],'' which features a set of "[[Polovtsian Dances]]".

The name Cuman is still the name of several villages in different parts of [[Turkey]], such as Kumanlar, including the Black Sea region.
