'''Arthur William Radford''' (27 February 27 1896 <U+2013> 17 August 1973) was a [[United States Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] and [[naval aviator]]. In his over 40 years of military service, Radford served a variety of roles including [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]], commander of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] and later the second [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

With an interest in ships and aircraft from a young age, Radford saw his first sea duty aboard a battleship during [[World War I]]. In the [[inter-war period]] he earned his pilot wings and rose through the ranks in duties aboard ships and in the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]]. After the U.S. entered [[World War II]], Radford was the architect of the development and expansion of the Navy's naval aviator training programs in the first years of the war. In its final years he commanded [[carrier battle group]]s through several major campaigns of the [[Pacific War]].

Noted as a strong-willed and aggressive leader, Radford was a central figure in the post-war debates on U.S. military policy, and was a staunch proponent of naval aviation. As commander of the Pacific Fleet, Radford defended the Navy's interests in an era of shrinking defense budgets, and was a central figure in the "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]." As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Radford continued to advocate for aggressive foreign policy and a strong [[nuclear deterrent]] in support of the [[New Look (policy)|"New Look" policy]] of President [[Dwight Eisenhower]].

Retiring from the military in 1957, Radford continued to be a military adviser to several prominent politicians until his death in 1973. For his extensive service, Radford was awarded many military honors, and was the namesake of the [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyer]] {{USS|Arthur W. Radford|DD-968}}.

== Early life ==

Arthur William Radford was born on 27 February 1896 in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to John Arthur Radford, a [[Canada|Canadian]]-born [[electrical engineer]], and Agnes Eliza Radford (n<U+00E9>e Knight).<ref name="Muir159">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=159}}</ref> Arthur, the eldest of four children, was described as bright and energetic in his youth. When Arthur was six years old, the family moved to [[Riverside, Illinois]], as his father took a job as managing engineer with [[Commonwealth Edison Company]]. John Radford managed the first [[steam turbine]] engines in the United States, at the [[Fisk Street Generating Station]].<ref name="Muir160">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=160}}</ref>

Radford began his school years at Riverside Public School, where he expressed an interest in the [[United States Navy]] from a young age.<ref name="Muir160"/> He gained an interest in [[aviation]] during a visit to the [[World Fair]] in [[San Fransisco, California]].<ref name="HE108">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=108}}</ref> By [[fourth grade]], he frequently drew detailed cross-section diagrams of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1}}. Performing very well in school, Radford was nonetheless a reserved student. In mid-1910, Radford moved with his family to [[Grinnell, Iowa]], and attended [[Grinnell High School]] for a year and a half, before deciding to apply to the [[United States Naval Academy]]. Radford obtained the local [[United States congressman|congressman]]'s appointment to the academy, and was accepted. After several months of tutoring at an [[Annapolis, Maryland]], he entered the academy in July 1912, at the age of sixteen.<ref name="Muir160"/>

In his first year, Radford had a mediocre academic performance, but applied himself to his studies in his remaining years at the Academy.<ref name="Muir160"/> He participated in summer cruises to Europe in 1913 and 1914 as well as through the [[Panama Canal]] to [[San Fransisco]] in 1916.<ref name=HE108 /> Radford, known as "Raddie" among other students, graduated 59 of 177 in the class of 1916, and was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[U.S. Navy]].<ref name="Muir160"/>

== Military career ==
Radford's first tour of duty was aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26}}.<ref name="Muir160"/> In this post he saw his first duty during [[World War I]].<ref name="Tucker725">{{harvnb|Tucker|2009|p=725}}</ref> He was aboard ''South Carolina'' as it escorted one transatlantic convoy to [[France]] in 1918.<ref name="Stewart242"/> In his second tour, he was an [[aide-de-camp]] to a battleship division commander, and then as a [[flag lieutenant]] for another battleship division commander.<ref name="Muir160"/>

[[File:Uss south carolina bb.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|South Carolina|BB-26}}, on which Radford served his first tour of duty during World War I.]]
In 1920, Radford reported to [[Pensacola, Florida]], for [[flight training]],<ref name="Muir160"/> and became a [[Lieutenant (US Navy)|lieutenant]] soon thereafter. Between the 1920s and 1930s, Radford alternated between sea duty with several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]].<ref name="Muir160"/> It was during this time that Radford served under then-[[Rear Admiral]] [[William Moffett]], and where his frequent interaction with politicians gave him the political acumen that would be useful later in his career. While he did not attend [[Naval War College]] as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind frankly, even to superiors.<ref name="HE109">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=109}}</ref>

Radford was a [[Lieutenant Commander(US Navy)|lieutenant commander]] by 1927,<ref name="Stewart242"/> and served with fighter squadron units aboard {{USS|Colorado|BB-45}}, {{USS|Pennsylvania|BB-38}}, and {{USS|Wright|AV-1}}.<ref name="Tucker725"/> In 1936, Radford was promoted to [[Commander (US Navy)|commander]]<ref name="Stewart242">{{harvnb|Stewart|2009|p=242}}</ref> and took charge of aircraft squadron [[VF-1B]] aboard {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3}}. By 1939, he was given command of [[Naval Air Station Seattle]] in [[Seattle, Washington]].<ref name="Tucker725"/> In May 1940, Radford was appointed as [[executive officer]] of the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5}}, a post he served for one year.<ref name="Muir160"/>

In July 1941, he was appointed commander of the Naval Air Station in [[Trinidad]], [[British West Indies]]. Radford did not enjoy this latest assignment, protesting his appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined from sea duty as [[World War II]] loomed.<ref name="Muir160"/> Radford only remained in this station for three months, however, because of a large organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators, and because of the vast difference in performance of combat aircraft over training aircraft at the time, pilots needed more time in combat aircraft to become proficient in them. [[Artemus L. Gates]], [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (AIR)|Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air]], visited Radford and was so impressed with him that he ordered rear admiral [[John H. Towers]] to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.<ref name="Muir161">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=161}}</ref>

=== World War II ===

==== Aviation Training Division ====
Radford took command of the Aviation Training Division in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 1 December 1941, seven days before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that brought the United States into World War II.<ref name="Muir161"/> He was appointed as Director of Aviation Training for both the Office of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] and the [[Bureau of Navigation]],<ref name="HE110">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=110}}</ref> in order to facilitate training coordination in a more centralized way for all naval aviators. With the U.S. mobilizing for war, Radford's office worked "dawn to dusk" six days a week in an effort to build up the necessary training infrastructure as quickly as possible. For several months, this around-the-clock work took up all of his time, and Radford later noted walking to work was his only form of exercise for several months. During this time, he impressed colleagues with a direct and no-nonsense approach to work, while still maintaining a demeanor that made him easy to work for.<ref name="Muir161"/> He was promoted to [[captain (naval)|captain]] soon after.<ref name="Stewart242"/>

Throughout 1942, the administrative infrastructure for aviation training was set up and refined, and Radford oversaw the massive growth of the training division, establishing separate sections for administration, Physical Training Service Schools, training devices and sections to train various aviators in flight, aircraft operation, radio operation, and gunnery. The section also organized technical training and established training literature. Radford also oversaw the establishment of four field commands for pilot training: Air Primary Training Command oversaw all pre-flight schools and [[US Navy Reserve|Naval reserve]] aviation bases in the country. Air Intermediate Training Command administered [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] and [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]] where flight training was conducted. Air Operational Training Command oversaw all education of pilots between pilot training and their first flying assignments. Air Technical Training Command trained enlisted men for support jobs in aviation such as maintenance, engineering, aerography, and parachute operations. Radford sought to integrate his own efficient leadership style into the organization of these schools.<ref name="Muir162">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=162}}</ref>

Radford was also noted for thinking progressively and innovatively to establish the most effective and efficient training programs. He sought to integrate [[sports conditioning]] programs into naval aviator training, bringing in athletic directors from [[Ohio State University]], [[Harvard University]] and [[Penn State University]] under [[american football]] player and naval aviator [[Tom Hamilton (American football)|Tom Hamilton]] to develop conditioning programs.  He also suggested integrating women into intricate but repetitive tasks, such as running [[flight simulator]]s. When commanders rejected the idea of bringing women into the service, Radford convinced Congressman [[Carl Vinson]], chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee. This effort eventually led to the employment of the "[[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]]", and 23,000 WAVES would assist in aeronautical training in the course of the war. Radford also sought to best use the assets of businessmen and established professionals who had volunteered for military service, establishing the Aviation Indoctrination School and Air Combat Intelligence School at [[Naval Air Station Quonset Point]] for these professionals to become more experienced Naval officers.<ref name="Muir163">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=163}}</ref>

==== Sea duty ====
[[File:Adm Radford Capt Clark on USS Yorktown (CV-10) 1943.jpg|thumb|Radford (right) with Captain [[Joseph J. Clark]] aboard ''Yorktown'', October 1943]]
By early 1943, with Radford's training programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty.<ref name="Muir164"/> In April of that year, he was ordered to report to [[Commander Air Force, Pacific Fleet]] where he was promoted to rear admiral and assigned as a carrier division commander.<ref name="Tucker725"/> This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a [[capital ship]]. Radford then spent May and June 1943 on an inspection party under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific.<ref name="Muir164">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=164}}</ref> Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral [[Frederick C. Sherman]], commander of [[Carrier Division Two]] at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. Radford was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on a carrier, and in June 1943, he was ordered onto the [[light aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Independence|CVL-22}}, there learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.<ref name="Muir164"/>

On 21 July 1943, Radford was given command of [[Carrier Division Eleven]], which consisted of the new [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'' class carrier]]  {{USS|Lexington|CV-16}} as well as the light carriers USS ''Independence'' and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23}}. These carriers remained at Pearl Harbor through August, training and refining their aircraft operations. Radford got his first operational experience on 1 September 1943, covering a foray to [[Baker Island|Baker]] and [[Howland Island]]s as part of Task Force 11 under Rear Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]]. Radford commanded ''Princeton'', {{USS|Belleau Wood|CVL-24}} and four destroyers to act as a covering force for Lee's Marines, who built an airfield on the islands.<ref name="Muir165">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=165}}</ref> This operation successful, [[Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] sent Task Force 15, with ''Lexington'', under Rear Admiral [[Charles A. Pownall]], and Radford and Pownall steamed for [[Tarawa Atoll]] to strike it. The night of 17<U+2013>18 September, the carriers launched six strikes of [[fighter aircraft]], [[dive bomber]]s, and [[torpedo planes]] to work over the Japanese defenses.<ref name="Muir166">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=166}}</ref>

Next, Radford took part in an air attack and cruiser bombardment of [[Wake Island]] on 5<U+2013>6 October 1943. Radford shifted his flag to ''Lexington'' for the operation, which took two days. Though the results of the operations on Japanese positions were not known, Radford and other leaders saw that they were preparing the ships' crews for smooth combat operations, thus readying them for the many major battles to come in the [[Central Pacific Area|Central Pacific]].<ref name="Muir166"/>

==== Major combat operations ====

The first major operations in the Central Pacific began that November. The next operation Radford took part in was [[Operation Galvanic]], campaign into the [[Gilbert Islands]] which with the objective of capturing Tarawa as well as [[Makin (islands)|Makin Island]] and [[Apamama|Apamama Atoll]]. It would be the first time that American carriers would be operating against Japanese land-based air power in force as [[U.S. Army]] troops and [[U.S. Marines]] fought the Japanese on the ground. For this operation, Radford was given command of Task Group 50.2, the Northern Carrier Group, which consisted of {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6}}, ''Belleau Wood'' and {{USS|Monterey|CVL-26}}. Radford did not agree with this strategy, stating until his death the force should have gone on an offensive to strike Japanese air power instead of being tied to the ground forces. Regardless of his objections, the force left Pearl Harbor on its mission on 10 November.<ref name="Muir167">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=167}}</ref>

The invasion began on 20 November, and Radford's force was busy with [[air strike]]s on Japanese ground targets. It also faced frequent attack by Japanese aircraft at night, which increasingly became a threat, as U.S. aircrews were not well prepared or equipped for night combat.<ref name="Muir168"/> It was during this combat that Radford improvised a unit to counter Japanese night raids, and is credited with establoshing routines for nighttime patrols to protect carriers which were adopted fleetwide.<ref name="Stewart243">{{harvnb|Stewart|2009|p=243}}</ref> However, in an attack on the night of 26 November, [[Edward O'Hare]], the group commander of the ''Enterprise'' air group, was shot down and killed. Radford commanded Carrier Division Eleven around Tarawa for several more days, returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 December.<ref name="Muir168">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=168}}</ref>

Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned as Towers' [[chief of staff]], where he assisted in planning upcoming operations, including [[Operation Flintlock (World War II)|Operation Flintlock]], the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Radford had hoped to return to combat duty at the end of this assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as [[Deputy Chief of Naval Operations]]. He assumed this new duty on 1 April under Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain, Sr.]]. Radford returned to primarily administrative duties in this time.<ref name="Muir168"/> His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft wear and tear. After six months in this duty, new Chief of Naval Operations [[Aubrey W. Fitch]] returned Radford to the Pacific theater.<ref name="Muir169">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=169}}</ref>

Radford returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 October 1944, where he was appointed as commander of the First Carrier Task Force in [[Carrier Division Six]]. While flying to his new command, Radford was held over in Kwajalein and then Saipan, missing the [[battle of Leyte Gulf]] which took place in [[The Philippines]] during the layover. Radford flew to [[Ulithi]] where he reported to McCain. For the next two months, Radford remained on "make learn" status, as a passenger aboard {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14}}, part of [[Task Group 38.3]] and again under Sherman's command.<ref name="Muir169"/> During this time, he observed the [[battle of Luzon|strikes on Luzon and the Visayas]], as well as air attacks on Japanese shipping and [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|Typhoon Cobra]].<ref name="Muir170">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=170}}</ref>

{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="To every officer and man in this splendid group well done [.] In the last 45 days you have contributed much toward the victory announced today and I am proud of you."|source=<U+2014>Radford's message to his fleet at the end of World War II.<ref name="Muir171"/>}}
On 29 December 1944, Radford was unexpectedly ordered to take command of Task Group 38.1 after its commander was injured. The next day the fleet sortied from Ulithi and headed for scheduled air strikes on [[Luzon]] and [[Formosa]]. Throughout January 1945, Radford's fleet operated in the [[South China Sea]] striking Japanese targets in [[French Indochina]] and [[Hong Kong]]. In February, the [[U.S. Third Fleet]] was re-designated the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet]], and as a part of this reorganization Radford's force was redesignated Task Group 58.4. Rafdord continued striking Japanese targetsin the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] in March. On 1 April, the force was moved to support the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. Over the course of the next two months, Radford's force continued its use of night raids, which by this point were effective in repelling Japanese attacks on U.S. Navy ships. After two months supporting ground forces on Okinawa, Radford's fleet was detached from that operation.<ref name="Muir171">{{harvnb|Muir|2001|p=171}}</ref>

Returning to the Third Fleet and being re-designated Task Group 38.4, the force began operating of the [[Japanese Home Islands]] in July 1945. They began an intense airstrike campaign against military targets on [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]], striking Japanese airfields, merchant shipping, and ground targets. Radford commanded the force in this duty until [[V-J Day]], the end of the war in the Pacific. Upon receipt of the orders to end hostilities, Radford signaled his ships that he was proud of their accomplishments.<ref name="Muir171"/>

=== Postwar ===
[[File:RadfordTruman.jpg|thumb|250px|Radford and President [[Harry S. Truman]], 1950]]
Radford was promoted to vice admiral in late 1945.<ref name=Tucker725 /> For a time he was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air under [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[James V. Forrestal]].<ref name=HE110 /> In the [[post-war period]] he was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Ernest J. King]] issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford suggested he double the number, a politically unrealistic proposal.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=14}}</ref>

After the end of the war, Radford was a principal opponent in a plan to merge the [[uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]]. A plan existed to split the Army and the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] into separate branches and unite them and the Navy under one [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]-level defense organization. Fearing the loss of their branch's influence, Navy commanders opposed the formation of a separate Air Force and favored a more loose defense organization. Radford was picked by Forrestal to form the Secretary's Committee of Research and Reorganization. Months of discussion resulted in the [[National Security Act of 1947]], a political Navy victory, because it created the [[U.S. Air Force]] while resulting in a coordinated, not unified, [[U.S. Department of Defense]] with limited power and with the Navy maintaining control of its air assets.<ref name=HE110 /> In 1947, Radford was briefly appointed commander of the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Task Fleet]], a move he felt was to distance him from the budget negotiations in Washington, but nonetheless preferred.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=41}}</ref>

In 1948, Radford was appointed by [[President of the U.S.|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] as the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=44}}</ref> Then, in 1949, Truman appointed Radford as the [[High Commissioner of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands|High Commissioner]] of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]]. Debates continued with military leaders about the future of the armed forces as Truman sought to trim the defense budget. Radford was relied on by Navy leaders as an expert who would fiercely defend the Navy's interests from budget restrictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=40}}</ref><ref name=HE110 /> These appointments were opposed, however, by Fleet Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], who feared Radford's hard-line stance on the budget would alienate the other branches.<ref name="HE114">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=114}}</ref> Still, historians contend Radford brought strong leadership to the role.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=47}}</ref> Naval aviation assets grew from 2,467 aircraft to 3,467 during this time, almost all fast-attack carrier aircraft. He also oversaw the implementation of the "Full Air Program" which envisioned 14,500 total aircraft in the naval air force.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=52}}</ref> Radford, along with his predecessor [[John Dale Price]], favored reducing naval ship strength in order to develop stronger naval aviation capabilities.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1990|p=53}}</ref>

== Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet ==
In April 1949, Truman appointed Radford to the position of [[Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet|Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet]]. Radford, a staunch [[anticommunist]], saw the greatest threat to U.S. security to be from Asia, not Europe.<ref name=Tucker725 /> In these years, he traveled extensively throughout the Pacific as well as [[South Asia]] and the [[Far East]]. He became acquainted with political and military leaders in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], The Philippines, [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Peninsular Malaysia|Malaya]], [[Burma]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], Hong Kong, Formosa, and [[Japan]], and gained an in-depth understanding of the sociopolitical issues facing each nation and the region as a whole.<ref name="HE112"/>

=== "Revolt of the Admirals" ===
{{mainarticle|Revolt of the Admirals}}
Despite his new office, Radford was almost immediately recalled to Washington to continue hearings on the future of the U.S. military budget.<ref name="HE111">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=111}}</ref> Radford is considered a key figure in what would later be called the "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" which took place following the cancellation of the [[supercarrier]] {{USS|United States|CVA-58}} during the same month.<ref name=Tucker725 />

In Washington at the behest of committee chairman Carl Vinson, Radford strongly opposed plans by Secretary of Defense [[Louis A. Johnson|Louis Johnson]] and Secretary of the Navy [[Francis P. Matthews]], referring to the Air Force's principal bomber, the [[Convair B-36]], as a "billion dollar blunder." Radford also questioned the Air Force idea that U.S. air power should focus on nuclear weapons as its primary deterrent to war. In this opposition, he famously remarked of [[nuclear war]]; "In my opinion, the American people, if they were well-informed on all factors involved, would consider such a war morally reprehensible."<ref name="HE111"/> While the ''United States'' remained cancelled and the post-war cuts to the Navy were intact, U.S. military doctrine continued to emphasize conventional forces, and funding increased again during the [[Cold War]] era.<ref name="HE112">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=112}}</ref>

=== Korean War ===
[[File:Radford and MacArthur 1950.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Radford (right) and [[Douglas MacArthur]] confer on [[Wake Island]] in 1950. Radford was an admirer of MacArthur and a supporter of his strategies, both before and after the latter's [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|dismissal]].]]
Shortly after the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950, command of the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] was transferred from Radford to [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of the [[United Nations Command Korea]]. As such, Radford exercised no direct responsibility over forces involved in the conflict.<ref name=Tucker726>{{harvnb|Tucker|2009|p=726}}</ref>

Radford was an admirer of MacArthur and a proponent of his "[[Asia First]]" strategy.<ref name=Tucker726 /> He supported [[Operation Chromite]] in October 1950,<ref name=Tucker683>{{harvnb|Tucker|2009|p=683}}</ref> as well as as the [[United Nations]] mission of [[Korean reunification]]. Radford attended the [[Wake Island Conference]] between MacArthur and Truman on 15 October, and later recalled his belief that, should the [[China|Chinese]] intervene in the war, the U.S. could still prevail provided it was able to strike Chinese bases in [[Manchuria]] with air power. When the [[People's Volunteer Army]] did intervene in favor of [[North Korea]] the next month, Radford shared MacArthur's frustration at restrictions placed on the UN force in the war preventing it from striking Chinese soil. Once [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|Truman relieved MacArthur]] in April 1951, Radford reportedly gave the general a "Hero's welcome" in [[Hawaii]] as he was returning to the United States.<ref name=Tucker726 />

As commander of U.S. forces in the Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on his trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an [[exit strategy]] for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases and the use of nuclear weapons.<ref name=Tucker726 /> This view was shared by [[Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] and UNC Commander General [[Mark W. Clark]]. The end of the war came in July 1953, likely due to pressure of domestic problems on the part of the Chinese.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2009|p=670}}</ref> Still, the trip made enough of a good impression on Eisenhower that he sought to nominate Radford to be his [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].<ref name=Tucker726 />

== Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ==
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="I simply must find men who have the breadth of understanding and devotion to the country rather than to a single Service that will bring about better solutions than I get now. ... [strangely] enough the one man who sees this clearly is a Navy man who at one time was an uncompromising exponent of naval power and its superiority over any other kind of strength. That is Radford."|source=<U+2014>Eisenhower on his choice to nominate Radford as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<ref name="HE108"/>}}
Eisenhower nominated Radford to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in mid-1953. Eisenhower was originally cautious about Radford due to his involvement in the [[inter-service rivalry]] and "revolt" in 1949, but Radford's anticommunist views, as well as his knowledge of Asia and his support of Eisenhower's [[New Look (policy)|"New Look" defense policy]], made him an attractive nominee, particularly among [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s, to replace [[Omar Bradley]].<ref name="HE107">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=107}}</ref> During his nomination, Radford indicated a changed outlook from the positions he had taken during the "Revolt of the Admirals."<ref name="HE112"/> As Chairman, Radford was later known to be well-liked by both the President and by Congress.<ref name="HE115">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=115}}</ref>

=== Military budget ===
[[File:Radford and Eisenhower 1952.jpg|thumb|left|Radford meets [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in 1952. It was during this meeting that Radford so impressed the President-elect that he was nominated to be [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] the next year.]]
Radford was integral in formulating and executing the "New Look" policy, reducing spending on conventional military forces to favor a strong [[nuclear deterrent]] and a greater reliance on airpower.<ref name="HE107"/> In this time, he had to overcome resistance from Army leaders who opposed the reduction of their forces, and Radford's decisions, unfettered by inter-service rivalry, impressed Eisenhower.<ref name="HE108"/> In spite of his support of "New Look," Radford at times differed from Eisenhower on funding issues. Eisenhower on several occasions proposed drastic cuts Radford worried would render the U.S. Navy ineffective.<ref name="S243"/> In late 1954, for example, Radford testified before a congressional committee he felt some of Eisenhower's proposed defense cuts would limit the military ability for "[[massive retaliation]]," however instead of publicly disagreeing with the [[Eisenhower administration]] he worked from within and sought the funding to save specific strategic programs.<ref name="HE113">{{harvnb|Hattendorf|Elleman|2010|p=113}}</ref>

In 1956, Radford proposed protecting several military programs from funding reductions by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but the proposal was [[News leak|leaked]] to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] again disagreed on how to reduce force levels amid budget reductions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force reductions directly to Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson]], who along with Eisenhower, agreed to them.<ref name="HE113"/>

=== Foreign military policy ===
While Radford remained Eisenhower's principal adviser for the budget, he and Radford differed on matters of [[foreign policy]].<ref name="HE113"/> Radford advocated the use of nuclear weapons and of a firm military and diplomatic stance against China.<ref name="S243">{{harvnb|Stewart|2009|p=243}}</ref> Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a [[pre-emptive war]] against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. posessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.<ref name="HE113"/>

After France requested U.S. assistance for its [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|beleaguered force at Dien Bein Phu]] in 1954, Radford suggested an aggressive stance toward the [[Viet Minh]], recommending the U.S. threaten them with nuclear weapons as it had with the Chinese in Korea.<ref name=Tucker726 /> He also advocated for U.S. military intervention during the 1955 [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis]] as well as the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], which Eisenhower rejected in favor of diplomatic approaches and threats of force.<ref name="HE113"/>

Following the end of his second term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Radford opted to retire from the Navy in 1957. Following this, he entered the business world. However, Radford was called upon to serve as military [[campaign advisor]] to [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 election]], and again to [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]].<ref name=Tucker726 />

Radford died at 77 on 17 August 1973<ref name=Tucker726 /> at [[Bethesda Naval Medical Center]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. Radford was buried with the full honors accorded to a former four-star admiral, and a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Section 3 of the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].<ref name="Stewart243"/> In 1975, the Navy launched the [[anti-submarine warfare]]-specialized [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class destroyer]] {{USS|Arthur W. Radford|DD-968}}, named in Radford's honor.<ref name="Stewart243"/>
