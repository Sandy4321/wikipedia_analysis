"'''Ice Ice Baby'''" is an [[United States|American]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] song written by [[rapping|rapper]] [[Vanilla Ice|Robert "Vanilla Ice" Van Winkle]] and [[disc jockey|DJ]] Earthquake. The song samples the [[bass guitar|bass]]line of "[[Under Pressure]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[David Bowie]], who did not initially receive songwriting credit or royalties until after it had become a hit. Originally released on Van Winkle's 1989 [[debut album]] ''[[Hooked (Vanilla Ice album)|Hooked]]'' and later on his 1990 national debut ''[[To the Extreme]]'', it is his most famous and popular song. It has appeared in remixed form on ''[[Platinum Underground]]'' and ''[[Vanilla Ice Is Back!]]'' A [[rap rock]] version appears on the album ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'', under the title "Too Cold".

"Ice Ice Baby" was initially released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to Van Winkle's cover of "[[Play That Funky Music]]", but the single was not initially successful. When a disc jockey played "Ice Ice Baby" instead, it began to gain success. "Ice Ice Baby" was the first hip hop single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|charts]]. Topping the [[Austrian Singles Chart|Australia]]n, [[Dutch Top 40|Dutch]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]] charts, the song helped diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream, [[white person|white]] audience.

==Lyrics and music==
[[File:Vanilla Ice.jpg|left|thumb|Vanilla Ice based the song's lyrics upon the [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]] area which he lived in.]]
Robert Van Winkle, better known by his stage name Vanilla Ice, wrote "Ice Ice Baby" at the age of 16, basing its lyrics upon the [[South Florida]] area in which he was raised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/nov/03/popandrock.exhibition |title=''Is this it?'' |accessdate=2009-02-13 |last=Rayner |first=Alex |date=November 3, 2007 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> The lyrics describe a [[drive-by shooting]] and Van Winkle's rhyming skills.<ref name="PerulloFenn">{{cite book |last1=Perullo |first1=Alex |last2=Fenn |first2=John |editor1-first=Berger |editor1-last=Harris M. |editor2-first=Carroll |editor2-last=Michael Thomas |title=Global Pop, Local Language |year=2003 |publisher=Univ.

The song's hook [[sample (music)|sample]]s the [[bass guitar|bass]]line of the 1981 song "[[Under Pressure]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[David Bowie]].<ref name="Hess">{{cite book |last=Hess |first=Mickey |title=Is Hip Hop Dead? |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0275994619 |page=118 |chapter=Vanilla Ice: The Elvis of Rap }}</ref> [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[David Bowie]] did not receive credit or royalties for the sample.<ref name="Westfahl">{{cite book |last1=Westfahl |first1=Gary |title=Science Fiction, Children's Literature, and Popular Culture |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0313308470 |page=100 |chapter=Legends of the Fall: Behind the Music }}</ref> In a 1990 interview, Van Winkle said the two melodies were slightly different because he had added an additional note.

Van Winkle described himself as the first rapper to cross into the [[pop music|pop]] market, and said as a result he "had to take the heat for a lot of people" for his music's use of samples, but that the criticism he earned over the sample allowed for the use of sampling to become acceptable in mainstream hip hop.<ref>{{cite news |first=Alida |last=Hoebee |title=''Vanilla Ice - He's Still Cool'' |url=http://www.samesame.com.au/features/1790/Vanilla-Ice-Hes-Still-Cool.htm |publisher=Inside Out |location=Australia |date=December 24, 2007 |accessdate=13 February 2009 }}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reviewer Mim Udovitch wrote that "[Vanilla Ice] probably would have scored with his hit rap single 'Ice Ice Baby' even if he hadn't been white. There's just something about the way its hook <U+2014> a sample from Queen and David Bowie's 'Under Pressure' <U+2014> grabs you and flings you out onto the dance floor."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318500,00.html |title=Review of ''To the Extreme'' |accessdate=2009-02-13 |last=Udovitch |first=Mim |date=November 2, 1990 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref>
