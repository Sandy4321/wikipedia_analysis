'''Joseph Jeffrey Hazelwood''' (born September 24, 1946) is an American [[sailor]].  He was the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' during its [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|1989 oil spill]]. He was accused of being intoxicated which contributed to the disaster, but was cleared of this charge at his 1990 trial after witnesses testified that he was sober around the time of the accident.  Hazelwood was convicted of a lesser charge, negligent discharge of oil (a misdemeanor), fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of [[community service]]. In 1999, the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill was listed as the 53rd largest spill in history.<ref>[http://www.scu.edu.au/schools/edu/student_pages/1999/tryfell/OIL%20WEB/Largest%20Spills/Table%202.html 1999 list of Largest oil spills].</ref>

In 1964, Hazelwood graduated from [[Huntington High School (New York)|Huntington High School]], where his [[IQ]] was tested at 138.<ref name="outside-online"/> As a youth he was an avid sailor and was a member of the [[Sea Scouts]]. In May 1968, he received a [[bachelor of science]] degree in marine transportation from the [[State University of New York Maritime College]].<ref name="NTSB">NTSB report MAR-90-04. Adopted July 31, 1990.</ref>

==Early career==
Following college, on June 10, 1968 he was hired as a [[Third Mate]] by Humble Oil and Refining Company, which later became Exxon Shipping Company.<ref name="NTSB"/> His first ship was the ''Esso Florence'' based in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]].<ref name="BadTrip"/> Hazelwood climbed the ranks of the [[United States Merchant Marine|merchant marine]] until he obtained a [[Master Mariner|master's license]] at age 31. By age 32, he was the youngest captain working for [[Exxon]] when he took command of ''Exxon Philadelphia'', a California-to-Alaska oil tanker, in 1978. In 1985 he was master of the ''Exxon Chester'' when the asphalt carrier ran into a storm during its New York to South Carolina trip. High winds damaged the ship's mast including radar and radio communications antennas. Though the crew was prepared to abandon ship, Hazelwood rallied them and guided the ship to safety.<ref name="BadTrip"/> In 1987, he became the alternate master of ''Exxon Valdez'' which subsequently received Exxon Fleet safety awards for the year of 1987 and 1988.<ref name="EightiesClub">Manning, Jason.

Hazelwood's driver's license had been suspended or revoked three times by the state of New York for alcohol violations since 1984. At the time of the ''Exxon Valdez'' incident, his New York state driving privileges were suspended as a result of a [[driving under the influence]] arrest on September 13, 1988.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Hulen| title=Captain's record shows 3 alcohol arrests | url=http://www.adn.com/evos/stories/EV57.html | work=The Anchorage Daily News | date=March 28, 1989 | accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> He entered a rehabilitation program in 1985 at South Oaks Hospital in [[Amityville, New York]].

==Exxon Valdez oil spill==

{{main|Exxon Valdez oil spill}}
''Exxon Valdez'' departed the [[Valdez oil terminal|port of]] [[Valdez, Alaska]] at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the [[traffic separation scheme]] (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver and sometime after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his [[stateroom]] at the time of the accident. He left [[Third Mate]] [[Gregory Cousins]] in charge of the navigation bridge and [[Able Seaman (occupation)|Able Seaman]] Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound traffic lane in the TSS at a prearranged point. ''Exxon Valdez'' failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck [[Bligh Reef]] at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 million gallons of oil, 20% of the cargo, into [[Prince William Sound]].<ref>{{cite web  | title=Questions and Answers | url=http://www.evostc.state.ak.us/facts/qanda.cfm | publisher=Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council | date= | accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref> 

During Hazelwood's trial following the accident, Alaska state prosecutors failed to convince the jury that Hazelwood was intoxicated at the time of the grounding. By his own admission, Hazelwood drank "two or three vodkas" between 4:30 and 6:30 that same night, his [[blood alcohol content]] was found to be .061. However, the defense argued that the blood samples were taken nearly ten hours after the incident and were mishandled. Most states, including Alaska, do not allow samples after three hours and a preservative required to halt fermentation was not added to the sample. Fermentation could have added to the amount of alcohol in the sample, making the result invalid. As a result of the accident, in 1991 the [[United States Coast Guard]] suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of [[community service]].<ref name="outside-online"/>

==Post-''Exxon Valdez''==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Time cover-Joseph Hazelwood Exxon Valdez July 24 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine featured Joseph Hazelwood and the ''Exxon Valdez'' in the July 24, 1989 edition.|{{FFDC|1=Time cover-Joseph Hazelwood Exxon Valdez July 24 1989.jpg|log=2009 May 19|date=May 2012}}]] -->

Captain Hazelwood never had his masters' license revoked and it remains valid to this date, but he has been unable to find long-term work as a captain after the spill. His alma mater, [[State University of New York Maritime College|SUNY Maritime College]], hired him in a show of solidarity as a teacher aboard the T/S ''Empire State V'' the year after the incident with the Valdez. In 1997, he was working as a para-legal and maritime consultant with New York City's Chalos & Brown, the firm that represented him in his legal cases. He was residing on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]] in [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], New York in 1997.<ref>[[Time (magazine)|Time]].

Though he was originally sentenced to assist with the clean-up of the oil spill, due to the lengthy appeals process, his community service was conducted in the [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], Alaska, area, beginning in June 1999 picking up trash from local roads then later moving to Bean's Cafe, a local [[soup kitchen]].<ref>People Weekly, July 12, 1999 v52 i1 p62</ref> His community service was conducted over five years with the Anchorage Parks Beautification Program.<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=p18 col 2 (35 col in) | url= | work=The New York Times Magazine | date=June 13, 1999 | accessdate=}}</ref> He paid the $50,000 fine in May 2002.<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=pA19(N) col 1 (1 col in) | url= | work=The New York Times | date=May 17, 2002 | accessdate=}}</ref>

In 2009, Hazelwood offered a "heartfelt apology" to the people of Alaska, but suggested he had been wrongly blamed for the disaster: "The true story is out there for anybody who wants to look at the facts, but that's not the sexy story and that's not the easy story," he said. Hazelwood said he felt Alaskans always gave him a fair shake. The apology appears in an interview in the book ''The Spill: Personal Stories from the Exxon Valdez Disaster'' by Sharon Bushell.<ref>Bushell, Sharon. 2009.

Immediately following the ''Exxon Valdez'' incident, Hazelwood was ridiculed by talk shows and late night television. For example, according to one of [[Late Night with David Letterman|David Letterman's Top Ten lists]] one of his excuses was, "I was just trying to scrape some ice off the reef for my margarita."<ref name="outside-online"/> He was featured in syndicated comic strips like ''[[The Far Side]]'' strip, which showed him as a clumsy person who spilled in various stages of his life; as a baby (his cup), teenager (pen ink in his shirt pocket), and others. The six-picture single-panel strip ends with Hazelwood driving into a water tower.<ref>[[Gary Larson|Larson, Gary]]. The Complete Far Side: 1980-1994. October 2003. ISBN 0-7407-2113-5.</ref>  

The 1995 film ''[[Waterworld]]'' anointed Hazelwood the [[patron saint]] of the movie's villain "The Deacon", leader of the "Smokers", a band of scavenging raiders. They displayed his portrait prominently aboard their flagship, the ''Exxon Valdez''.<ref name="outside-online"/> In 2001, the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'' satirized Hazelwood in the episode, "[[The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz]]." The episode had [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] as the captain of an intergalactic oil tanker who was, in an absurd parallel, not drunk enough (because robots in Futurama require alcohol to function properly) and crashed the ship into a [[penguin]] [[animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] on [[Pluto]], spilling the whole load of Dark-matter-oil.

The ''[[American Dad]]'' episode "[[You Debt Your Life]]" revealed that Roger the alien got Joseph Hazelwood drunk, which led to the oil spill happening.

In the Australian comedy television series ''[[Newstopia]]'', Captain Hazelwood maintains that his BAC was not a big deal, and that at the time he was "sober enough to drive a car, in Mexico."
