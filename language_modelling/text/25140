'''Michael Stanley Dukakis''' ({{IPAc-en|d|<U+0289>|<U+02C8>|k|<U+0251><U+02D0>|k|<U+0268>|s}}; born November 3, 1933) served as the [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|65th and 67th]] [[Governor of Massachusetts]] from 1975<U+2013>1979 and from 1983<U+2013>1991, and was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States presidential election, 1988|presidential nominee in 1988]].  He was born to [[Greeks|Greek]] [[immigration|immigrant]]s  in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], also the birthplace of [[John F.

===First governorship (1975<U+2013>1979)===
{{Main|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1974}}
[[File:Governor Dukakis speaks at the 1976 Democratic National Convention (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Governor Michael Dukakis at the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] in New York City.]]
After winning four terms to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] between 1962 and 1970 and winning the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 1970<ref>[http://www.hri.org/hri/dukakis.html]</ref>), Dukakis was elected governor in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican [[Francis Sargent]] during a period of fiscal crisis. Dukakis won in part by promising to be a 'reformer' and pledging not to increase the state's sales tax to balance the state budget. He would later reverse his position after taking office. He also had pledged to dismantle the powerful [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Metropolitan District Commission]] (MDC), a bureaucratic enclave that served as home to hundreds of political patronage employees. The MDC managed Massachusetts' parks, reservoirs, and waterways, as well as the highways and roads abutting those waterways. In addition to its own police force, the MDC had its own maritime patrol force, and an enormous budget from the state, for which it provided minimal accounting. Dukakis' efforts to dismantle MDC failed in the legislature, where MDC had many powerful supporters. The MDC would later withhold its critical backing of Dukakis in the 1978 gubernatorial primary.

Governor Dukakis was an amiable host to President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] during their visits to Boston in 1976 to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States. He gained some notice as the only person in the state government who went to work during the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of 1978]], during which, he went to local TV studios in a sweater to announce emergency bulletins. Dukakis is also remembered for his 1977 [[exoneration]] of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]], two Italian anarchists whose trial sparked protests around the world, and who were electrocuted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 50 years earlier in 1927.

During his first term in office, Dukakis [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentences of 21 first-degree murderers and those of 23 second-degree murderers. Due to controversy engendered by some of these individuals having re-offended, Dukakis curtailed the practice later, issuing no commutations in his last three years as governor.<ref>{{Cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=If you thought Duke<U+2019>s commutations were bad, be warned: Patrick<U+2019>s could be so much worse |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=160964 |work=[[Boston Herald]] |publisher= |date=2006-10-06 |accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}</ref>

However, this performance did not prove enough to offset a backlash against the state's high sales and property tax rates, which turned out to be the predominant issue in the 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Dukakis, despite being the incumbent Democratic governor, was refused renomination by his own party. The [[Massachusetts Democratic Party|state Democratic Party]] chose to support Director of the [[Massachusetts Port Authority]] [[Edward J. King]] in the [[primary election|primary]], partly because King rode the wave against high property taxes, but more significantly because state Democratic Party leaders lost confidence in Dukakis' ability to govern effectively. King also enjoyed the support of the power brokers at the MDC, who were unhappy with Dukakis' attempts to dismantle the powerful bureaucracy. King also had support from state police and public employee unions. Dukakis suffered a scathing defeat in the primary, it was "a public death", according to his wife Kitty.

===Second governorship (1983<U+2013>1991)===
{{Main|Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1982}}
Four years later, having made peace with the state Democratic Party, MDC, the state police and public employee unions, Dukakis defeated King in a 're-match' in the 1982 Democratic primary.  He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, [[John Winthrop Sears]] in the November election. Future United States Senator and 2004 Democratic Presidential nominee [[John Kerry]] was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts|lieutenant governor]] on the same ballot with Dukakis, and served in the Dukakis administration from 1983<U+2013>85.

Dukakis served as governor during which time he presided over a high-tech boom and a period of prosperity in Massachusetts and simultaneously getting the reputation for being a 'technocrat'.  The National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective governor in 1986. Residents of the city of [[Boston]] and its surrounding areas remember him for the improvements he made to Boston's [[public transport|mass transit]] system, especially major renovations to the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|city's trains and buses]]. He was known as the only governor who rode the [[Rapid transit|subway]] to work every day.

In 1988, Dukakis and [[Rosabeth Moss Kanter]], his economic adviser in the 1988 presidential elections, wrote a book entitled ''Creating the future: the Massachusetts comeback and its promise for America'', an examination of the [[Massachusetts Miracle]].<ref>Butterfield, Fox (May 1, 1988).[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/01/books/what-you-see-is-what-you-get.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm "What you see is what you get"].

==1988 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1988|Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1988}}
Using the phenomenon termed the "[[Massachusetts Miracle]]" to promote his campaign, Dukakis sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for [[President of the United States]] in the [[1988 United States presidential election]], prevailing over a primary field that included [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Dick Gephardt]], [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], [[Gary Hart]], [[Joe Biden]] and [[Al Gore]], among others. Touching on his immigrant roots, Dukakis used [[Neil Diamond]]'s ode to immigrants, "[[America (Neil Diamond song)|America]]", as the theme song for his campaign. Famed composer [[John Williams]] wrote "Fanfare for Michael Dukakis" in 1988 at the request of Dukakis's father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson. The piece was premiered under the baton of Dickson (then the Associate Conductor of the Boston Pops) at that year's [[1988 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, with 2,877 out of 4,105 delegates. Dukakis chose [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Lloyd Bentsen]] of [[Texas]] to be his [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential]] running mate.

Dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was often referred to as "[[Zorba the Greek|Zorba the Clerk]]". Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with George Bush, but in the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and spent quite a bit of the day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold. During the campaign, Dukakis's mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to ''The New York Times'', "persistent suggestions" that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past.<ref>"[http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:ju3meXmTpjsJ:query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fsec%3Dhealth%26res%3D940DEFDA1F3BF937A3575BC0A96E948260+%22Look,+I%27m+not+going+to+pick+on+an+invalid.%22+attempted&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=2 Dukakis Releases Medical Details To Stop Rumors on Mental Health]", ''The New York Times'', August 4, 1988.</ref>

Dukakis' general election campaign was subject to several criticism and gaffes on issues such as capital punishment, the pledge of allegiance in schools, and most famously: the tank incident. During the campaign, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]], the Republican nominee criticized him for his traditionally liberal positions on many issues, calling him "a card-carrying member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]." Dukakis' support for a prison [[furlough]] program was a major election subject. During his first term as Governor, he had vetoed a bill that would have stopped furloughs for first-degree murderers.<ref>Oshinsky, David. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DA133AF933A15753C1A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=3 <U+201C>What Became of the Democrats<U+201D>], New York Times (1991-10-20): "In 1976 the state legislature passed a bill that would have ended the furloughs of first-degree murderers. Governor Dukakis, as the Edsalls point out, vetoed it. A strong advocate of prisoners' rights, he contended that the bill would 'cut the heart out of efforts at inmate rehabilitation.'"</ref>  During his second term, that program resulted in the release of convicted murderer [[Willie Horton|William "Willie" Horton]],<ref>''Crime, Risk and Insecurity" ed. Tim Hope and Richard Sparks, p. 266</ref> who committed a rape and assault in [[Maryland]] after being furloughed. [[George H. W. Bush]] mentioned Horton by name in a speech in June 1988, and a conservative [[political action committee]] affiliated with the Bush campaign, the National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled "Weekend Passes", which used a [[mug shot]] image of Horton, although the Bush campaign refused to repudiate it. That [[advertising campaign|ad campaign]] was followed by a separate Bush campaign ad, "[[Revolving Door (television advertisement)|Revolving Door]]", criticizing Dukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton. The legislature canceled the program during Dukakis's last term.

The issue of capital punishment came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees. Because she knew the [[Willie Horton]] issue would be brought up, Dukakis's campaign manager, [[Susan Estrich]], had prepared with Michael Dukakis an answer highlighting the candidate's empathy for victims of crime, noting the beating of his father in a robbery and the death of his brother in a hit-and-run car accident. However, when [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]], the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, "Governor, if [[Kitty Dukakis]] [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?" Dukakis replied, "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life", and explained his stance. After the debate.<ref>"[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/9/27/103737.shtml The Debates]" Susan Estrich, September 2004</ref> Many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the passion one would expect of a person discussing a loved one's rape and death. Many<U+2013> including Dukakis himself<U+2013> believe this in part, cost him the election, as his poll numbers dropped from 49% to 42% nationally that night. Other commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue and forced the candidate to make a difficult choice.

[[File:Michael Dukakis in tank.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This publicity image of Michael Dukakis was taken to combat criticisms that he would be soft on issues of defense, but it backfired and seriously damaged his presidential campaign when many found it silly and unsubtle.]]
Dukakis was criticized during the campaign for a perceived softness on defense issues, particularly the controversial "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" program, which he promised to weaken. In response to this, Dukakis orchestrated what would become the key image of his campaign, although it turned out quite differently from what he intended. On September 13, 1988 Dukakis visited the [[General Dynamics]] Land Systems plant in [[Sterling Heights, Michigan]] to take part in a [[photo op]] in an [[M1 Abrams]] tank. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], had been photographed in a similar situation in 1986, riding in a [[Challenger 1 tank|Challenger]] tank while wearing a scarf.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/features/tank.shtml BBC - Radio4 - Today/The Fate of Tanks<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Compared with Dukakis' results, Thatcher's picture was very successful and helped her reelection prospects.<ref>[http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0309/lm10.html 100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life - The Digital Journalist<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> Footage of Dukakis was used in television ads by the Bush campaign, as evidence that Dukakis would not make a good [[commander-in-chief]], and "Dukakis in the tank" remains shorthand for backfired [[public relations]] outings.<ref>[http://www.apoliticus.com/tag/george-bush/]</ref> Although he had served in the [[United States Army]], Dukakis was widely mocked by his opponents for what they characterized as martial posturing and a silly image.

The Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost the election in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] landslide to George H.W. Bush, carrying only 10 states and the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Dukakis himself blames his defeat on the time he spent doing gubernatorial work in Massachusetts during the few weeks following the Democratic Convention. Many believed he should have been campaigning across the country. During this time, his 17-point lead in opinion polls completely disappeared, as his lack of visibility allowed Bush to define the issues of the campaign.

Despite Dukakis's loss, his performance was a marked improvement over the previous two Democratic efforts. Dukakis made some strong showings in states that had voted for Republicans [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. He also scored victories in states like [[Rhode Island]], [[Hawaii]], and Dukakis's home state of Massachusetts; [[Walter Mondale]] had lost all three, and since then, all three states have remained in the Democratic column for each subsequent presidential election. He swept [[Iowa]], winning by 10 points, an impressive feat in a state that had voted Republican in the last five presidential elections. He won 43% of the vote in [[Kansas]], a surprising showing in the home state of 1936 Republican presidential nominee [[Alf Landon]] and future Republican nominee [[Bob Dole]]. In another surprising showing, he received 47% of the vote in [[South Dakota]]; in [[Montana]], Dukakis won close 46% of the vote in a state that had voted over 60% Republican four years earlier. Dukakis's relative strength in farm states was no doubt due to the serious economic difficulties these states were facing in the 1980s, and it was the strongest showing in the Midwest for a Democrat since 1976.

[[File:ElectoralCollege1988.svg|thumb|left|Presidential electoral votes by state.]]
Although Dukakis cut into the Republican hold in the Midwest, he failed to dent the emerging GOP stronghold in the South that had been forming since 1964 with a temporary reprieve with [[Jimmy Carter]]. He lost most of the South in a landslide, with Bush's totals reaching around 60% in most states. He was able to hold Bush to 55% in Texas, though this was most likely due to [[Lloyd Bentsen]]'s presence on the ticket. He also carried most of the southern-central parishes of [[Louisiana]], despite losing the state. He held onto the border state of [[West Virginia]], and he captured 48% of the vote in [[Missouri]]. He also carried 41% in [[Oklahoma]], a bigger share than any Democrat since Jimmy Carter.

Dukakis won 41,809,476 votes in the popular vote. He also received 40% or more in the following states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont. Overall, the 1988 election showed a marked improvement in the popular vote for the Democrats. While he lost the popular vote, Dukakis's margin of loss (7.8%) was narrower than Jimmy Carter's in 1980 (9.7%) or Walter Mondale's in 1984 (18.2%). However, Dukakis was and is still regarded as a failed candidate, as he had enjoyed large summer leads and his drop in the polls can be attributed to his failed campaigning more than anything else.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 2008, he reflected on his defeat during an interview with [[Katie Couric]], in which he said he "owe[d] the American people an apology" because "if I had beaten the [[George H. W. Bush|old man]], we never would have heard of [[George W. Bush|the kid]], and we wouldn't be in this mess."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4386669n | work=CBS News | title=Dukakis Defends Obama Campaign}}</ref>

==Post-presidential election==
Dukakis' final two years as governor were marked by increased criticism of his policies and significant tax increases to cover the economic effects of the U.S. economy's "soft landing" at the end of the 1980s and the recession of 1990. He did not run for a fourth term in 1990; [[Boston University]] President [[John Silber]] won the Democratic nomination, but lost the general election to Republican [[William Weld]].

After the end of his term, he served on the [[board of directors]] for [[Amtrak]], and became a professor of [[political science]] at [[Northeastern University]], a visiting professor of political science at [[Loyola Marymount University]], and visiting professor in the Department of Public Policy at the School of Public Affairs at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Along with a number of other notable [[Greek Americans]], he is a founding member of [[The Next Generation Initiative]]: a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs. In November 2008, Northeastern named its new Center for Urban and Regional Policy after Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty.

Dukakis has developed a strong passion for [[grassroots]] campaigning and the appointment of precinct captains to coordinate local campaigning activities, two strategies he feels are essential for the Democratic Party to compete effectively in both local and national elections. In 2006, he and his wife worked to help Democratic candidate [[Deval Patrick]] in his successful effort to become governor of Massachusetts. He has also been an advocate for effective public transportation and high speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack of space at airports; and for extended learning time initiative in public schools.<ref>"[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/school-day-expanded-2015970-children-massachusetts Make the school day a full day]", ''[[The Orange County Register]]'', April 11, 2008.</ref><ref>"[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/]"</ref>

In August, 2009, the 75-year old Dukakis was mentioned as one of two leading candidates as a possible interim successor to [[Ted Kennedy]] in the U.S. Senate after his passing.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/08/21/who_should_fill_kennedys_seat/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Who should fill Kennedy's seat? | first=Scot | last=Lehigh | date=August 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8269945.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kennedy successor to be appointed | date=September 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> Gov.
