The '''Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge''' is the only international [[wildlife refuge]] in [[North America]].<ref name=MRRS>{{cite web|last=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]|url=http://www.fws.gov/Midwest/DetroitRiver/|date=2010|title=Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  It was established in 2001 and is managed jointly by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] and the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]].  The refuge is located along the western coast of [[Lake Erie]] and much of the southern portion of the [[Detroit River]].  It currently occupies 7.88 mi<U+00B2> (20.42 km<U+00B2>) of scattered property but has drawn boundaries for further expansion.<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|url=http://www.epa.gov/med/grosseile_site/indicators/refuge.html|date=2009|title=Detroit River-Western Lake Erie Basin Indicator Project|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge consists primarily of [[Wetland|coastal wetlands]], several [[List of islands in the Detroit River|islands in the Detroit River]], and waterfront parks.

==History==
Much of the land surrounding the Detroit River is urbanized and, in some places, heavily industrialized.  This has resulted in excessive [[water pollution]] from the unregulated dumping of chemicals and industrial waste for many decades.  Much of the garbage and sewage from Detroit's rapid industrialization found its way into the river.  Much of the Detroit River and its shoreline were heavily polluted and unsafe for recreational use.  Large quantities of this pollution collected around the mouth of the Detroit River at [[Lake Erie]].  The pollutants were so high after the spring thaw that thousands of migrating birds were killed by oil slicks and contaminated water every year.  Oxygen levels in the river were depleted to the point where fish were unable to inhabit its waters.  Because much of this pollution drained into and affected Lake Erie, portions of the lake itself were considered <U+201C>dead<U+201D> and unable to support aquatic life.  Swimming in the water or consuming any of its remaining fish were considered health risks.<ref name=hartig>{{cite web | first = John |last = Hartig |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/hunting/columns/story?columnist=swan_james&page=g_col_swan_det_river |date = 17 Jul 2007|title=The Detroit River's amazing comeback |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name=swan>{{cite web | first = James |last = Swan |url = http://www.glu.org/news/2009/03/return-of-the-detroit-river%E2%80%99s-charismatic-megafauna/ |date = 19 Mar 2009|title=Return of the Detroit River<U+2019>s Charismatic Megafauna |accessdate=June 16, 2009}}</ref>

In 1961, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was founded by congressional order thanks in part to Michigan politician [[John Lesinski, Jr.]], who was [[Michigan's 16th congressional district]] representative from 1951<U+2013>1965.  The refuse paved the way for tighter restrictions on industries and allocated much needed government funding to clean up the river.  However, there was little support from Detroit businesses toward cleaning up the river, because it would negatively affect Detroit's industrialism and economy.  In 1970, the entire [[fishing industry]] in the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], the [[Detroit River]], and [[Lake Erie]] had to be temporarily closed due to toxic levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] found in the water.  This caused the fishing industry and all those related to lose substantial amounts of money.  This, in turn, spurred a massive conservation effort aimed at cleaning up the Detroit River.<ref name=hartig/>  For years before, conservation efforts were halted by the enormous multi-million dollar cost of removing pollutants from the river.  In addition to that, industries, which had significant political influence, detested the regulations necessary to lessen the amount of pollutants in the river.<ref name=swan/>  The Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was very small though and only occupied the area surrounding [[Grassy Island]], and the refuge's existence could not prevent Grassy Island from becoming highly contaminated from toxic soil dredged from the nearby [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]].<ref name=GRAS>{{cite web| last=Millsap| first=Stephanie| url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/grassyisland/| date= 23 Jul 2009| title=Grassy Island Disposal Facility| accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  

In 2001, the Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge was absorbed into the much larger Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge, which was largely advocated by veteran Michigan representative [[John Dingell]].<ref name=MNRG>{{cite web|last=Midwest Natural Resources Group|url=http://www.mnrg.gov/accomplishments/detroit-river.htm|date=2005|title=Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  The refuge was officially signed into law as the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act (H.R. 1230) by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 21, 2001.<ref name=DROF>[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (2010). [http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=31521 Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge: Overview]. Retrieved March 17, 2010.</ref><ref name=CBOF/>  The [[Congressional Budget Office]] originally estimated that the creation of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge would cost between $13<U+2013>21 million over the first five years, in which the majority of the money spent would be through land acquisitions.<ref name=CBOF>{{cite web|last=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=3090&type=0|date=12 Sept 2001|title=H.R. 1230 <U+2013> Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  

Millions of dollars so far have been used for land acquisitions and to improve the environment around the river.  The recent cleaning up and restoration of the Detroit River is remarkable, although other problems are still at hand.<ref name=hartig/>  Today, many species of native animals<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>some [[endangered species]]<U+200A><U+2014><U+200A>are returning to the area after being driven out by human development.  The Detroit River is home to a growing number of bird species, such as [[eagle|eagles]] (including reintroduced [[bald eagle|bald eagles]]), [[osprey|ospreys]], and [[Peregrine Falcon|peregrine falcons]].  Fish species in abundance in the area include [[lake whitefish]], [[sturgeon]], [[salmon]], [[perch]], and [[walleye]].  Numerous mammal species also occupy the coastline throughout the refuge.  The area serves as a vital migratory route and resting place for countless species of birds.<ref name=swan/>  Over 30 species of [[waterfowl]], 17 species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]], 31 species of [[wader|shore<U+00AD>birds]], 160 species of [[songbird]]s, and 117 species of fish live along or regularly migrate through the Detroit River.<ref name=MNRG/>

==Current area==
[[File:Mud Island in DRIWR.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mud Island (Michigan)|Mud Island]] in [[Ecorse, Michigan]] is currently the northernmost portion of the refuge.]]
At its inception, the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge included only areas that were part of the former Wyandotte National Wildlife Refuge.  This included only 304 acres (123 ha) surrounding [[Grassy Island]] and [[Mamajuda Island]] just north of [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]] in the Detroit River.  Soon after, [[Mud Island (Michigan)|Mud Island]] just north of Grassy Island was donated to the refuge by the [[National Steel Corporation]].  The refuge continued to expand through land acquisitions to include [[Calf Island (Michigan)|Calf Island]] in 2002.  In 2003, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] stuck a cooperative agreement with [[DTE Energy]] to include portions of their properties into the refuge, including the Lagoona Beach Unit and Brancheau Unit of the [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station]].  This was the refuge's first expansion into [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]] along the coast of Lake Erie.  Other areas in Lake Erie extending as far south as the Michigan<U+2013>Ohio border were eventually included into the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.  Many of these lands were through cooperative management acquisitions, where the property would be included into the refuge but not owned directly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  

In 2004, the refuge grew to include Humbug Marsh, which is located in [[Gibraltar, Michigan|Gibraltar]] and also includes [[Hamburg Island]].  At the same time, the refuge acquired the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] Strong Unit just north of [[Estral Beach, Michigan|Estral Beach]].  In 2005, the refuge acquired joint management over the 243-acre (98 ha) Eagle Island Marsh in [[Monroe, Michigan]].  This land is located at the mouth of the [[River Raisin]] in between the [[Monroe Power Plant]] and [[Sterling State Park]].  This section, which was once very polluted, is owned by [[Automotive Components Holdings]] and is the location of a large [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] factory.  In 2006, the refuge grew to include the 780-acre (315 ha) [[Lake Erie Metropark]] in [[Rockwood, Michigan|Rockwood]].  With the acquisition of the Erie Marsh in 2006, the refuge doubled its size to include the southern wetlands of [[Erie Township, Michigan|Erie Township]] near the Ohio border, including Gard Island in the [[North Maumee Bay Archeological District]].  This was a major milestone for the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/michigan/preserves/art16985.html|date=2010|title=Erie Marsh Preserve|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  The refuge grew from its original 304 acres (123 ha) in 2001 to 5,047 acres (2,042 ha) by 2007.<ref name=EPA/>  The last of these acquisitions was an area referred to as Howard Fix at 65 acres (26 ha).  It is located near the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, but little has been published about this property.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ingels|first=Mike|url=http://www.blogsmonroe.com/expatriate/2007/04/do-not-enter-the-detroit-iwr/|date=Apr 2007|title=Do Not Enter: The Detroit River IWR|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>

The headquarters of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge are located in [[Grosse Ile Township, Michigan|Grosse Ile Township]], which itself is not officially listed as part of the refuge. In Canada, the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge does not have any formal boundaries, and no Canadian portions of the [[Detroit River]] or [[Lake Erie]] are officially included into the current refuge.<ref>{{cite web|last=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]|url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/detroitriver/documents/brochureAug23.pdf|date=2010|title=Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge brochure|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>  All properties and potential future land acquisition sites are within the United States and governed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Proposed expansion==
While the current boundaries of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge encompass only 7.88 mi<U+00B2> (20.42 km<U+00B2>) of property scattered along the west coast of the [[Detroit River]] and [[Lake Erie]], the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] has approved of future land acquisitions by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] totaling 18.75 mi<U+00B2> (48.56 mi<U+00B2>) of land and water.<ref name=EPA/>.  Expanding the territory through land acquisitions is a top priority for the refuge.<ref name=DROF/> The expansion of the refuge is limited due to finances and the fact that most areas within the proposed range are privately owned.  Currently, the majority of land within the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is jointly operated by individual landowners and by the federal government.  The expansion could also include areas of significant permanent populations, such as the island of [[Grosse Ile Township, Michigan|Grosse Ile Township]], the riverfronts of several [[Downriver]] communities, [[Frenchtown Charter Township, Michigan|Frenchtown Charter Township]], and [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]].

The proposed range stretches for 48 miles from the southern border of [[Detroit]] at [[Zug Island]] in the city of [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]] south all the way to the Michigan<U+2013>Ohio border.<ref name=EPA/><ref name=DROF/>  The expansion would not include any areas within the city limits of Detroit.  Potential areas within this realm include [[Zug Island]], [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]], [[Elizabeth Park (Michigan)|Elizabeth Park]], [[Pointe Mouillee State Game Area]], [[Sterling State Park]], and [[Turtle Island (Lake Erie)|Turtle Island]].  Potential Canadian additions to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge include the large [[Fighting Island]], which has already undergone major recovery after serving as a industrial dumping ground for decades, [[Grass Island (Ontario)|Grass Island]], [[Turkey Island]], [[Crystal Island (Ontario)|Crystal Island]], and [[Bois Blanc Island (Ontario)|Bois Blanc Island]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Metropolitan Affairs Coalition|url=http://www.mac-web.org/Publications/assets/ahrconservation.pdf|date=Oct 2001|title=A Conservation Vision for the Lower Detroit River Ecosystem|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>
