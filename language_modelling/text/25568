'''No. 8 (Guards) Commando''' was a [[battalion]]-sized [[British Commandos|commando]] unit of the [[British Army]] that served during the [[Second World War]]. Formed in June 1940 primarily from members of the [[Household Division]], the unit formed part of [[Layforce]] and deployed to the [[Middle East]] where they participated in operations on [[Crete]] and around [[Tobruk]] before being disbanded in late 1941. After this, many of its personnel went on to serve in other [[Special Forces|special forces]] units formed in the theatre, including the [[Special Air Service]].

==History==
===Formation===
Raised in June 1940 by [[Robert Laycock]] it was formed mainly from volunteers in the [[London]] district and included men from the [[Household Cavalry]], [[Foot Guards]], [[Somerset Light Infantry]], [[Royal Engineers]], [[Royal Artillery]] and the [[Royal Marines]].<ref>Saunders 1959, p. 23.</ref><ref>Moreman 2006, p. 12.</ref> In October 1940, as part of a reorganisation of the Commando formations, the unit was amalgamated with [[No. 3 Commando]] into a single special service battalion known as the 4th Special Service Battalion, under Laycock's command.<ref>Durnford-Slater 2002, pp. ix<U+2013>x.</ref><ref>Moreman 2006, p. 15.</ref> As a part of this organisation, the unit<U+2019>s name was changed to 'B' Special Service Company.<ref group="nb">No. 3 Commando formed 'A' Special Service Company in this organisation. Durnford-Slater 2002, p. ix.</ref> 

In January 1941 the special service battalion organisation was disbanded and the commando designation was readopted.<ref>Durnford-Slater 2002, p. x.</ref> As a result No. 8 (Guards) Commando were split from No. 3 Commando and raised back up to battalion strength.

Initially, training was fairly rudimentary and consisted mainly of "forced marches and heavy pressure",<ref>Parker 200, p. 31.</ref> however, more evolved training in operating with assault landing craft were undertaken later on and No. 8 Commando moved up to the small seaside town of Largs, on the coast in [[Ayrshire]], Scotland where they were billeted by the townspeople and remained there for about a month.<ref>Parker 2000, pp. 31<U+2013>32.</ref> The next move was to the town of Lamlash, on the island of Arran. Shortly after arriving there, though, Laycock had to disband an entire troop<U+2014>No. 8 Troop<U+2014>and most of the men were "returned to unit" as he felt that their training had not been up to standard.<ref name=Parker32>Parker 2000, p. 32.</ref> 

Nevertheless the unit continued to train and at this time No. 8 Commando formed an experimental section, known as the Folboat Section, under Lieutenant [[Roger Courtney]], who had convinced Laycock of the usefulness of the two-seat collapsible canoes by carrying out a mock raid on the [[HMS Glengyle|''Glengyle'']].<ref name=Parker32/><ref group="nb">The Folboat Section was later designated the Special Boat Section, a forerunner to the [[Special Boat Service]] that currently exists. Parker 2000, p. 32.</ref>

===Crete and Tobruk===
In February 1941, with an establishment of 38 officers and 502 other ranks, they embarked for the [[Middle East]]. Along with [[No. 7 Commando|No. 7]], [[No. 11 (Scottish) Commando|No. 11 (Scottish)]], [[No. 50 Commando|No. 50]] and [[No. 52 Commando|No. 52 Commandos]] they became part of [[Layforce]] and were redesignated 'B' Battalion of Laycock's [[brigade]]-sized force.<ref>Chappell 1996, pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref><ref>Saunders 1959, p. 52.</ref> They did not take part in the unsuccessful [[Siege of Tobruk#Raid on Bardia|raid on Bardia]], but on 27 May 1941, after a previously unsuccessful landing attempt two days earlier, a detachment  landed on [[Battle of Crete|Crete]] with 'A' Battalion (No. 7 Commando) and 'D' Battalion (Nos. 50 and 52 Commandos) in an effort to stem the tide of the German attack on the island long enough for the garrison to be evacuated.<ref>Saunders 1959, p. 55.</ref><ref>Chappell 1996, p. 16.</ref><ref>Parker 2000, pp. 50<U+2013>52.</ref> 

Throughout a period of five days from 27<U+2013>31 May they fought a series of rearguard actions around [[Sphakia]], before they too were evacuated. By that time, however, there were few vessels left and as a consequence many of the unit's men were left behind and subsequently captured.<ref>Saunders 1959, p. 57.</ref> Of the 800 men from Layforce that were sent to Crete, only about 200 escaped.<ref>Chappell 1996, p. 16.</ref>

Following the evacuation from Crete, a detachment from No. 8 (Guards) Commando consisting of five officers and 70 other ranks was sent to [[Tobruk]], which was at the time was under [[Siege of Tobruk|siege]]. In June the Allies launched [[Operation Battleaxe]], an attempt to relieve the garrison. Within this situation it was decided that the commandos in Tobruk could be used to carry out raids against the positions facing them. In the middle of the month the detachment from No. 8 (Guards) Commando began carrying out patrols in an effort to become familiar with the terrain and to practice moving at night. It was then decided that they would carry out a raid on an Italian position that was dominating the forward areas of the Indian [[18th Cavalry]]. The position, which was known as the Twin Pimples, consisted of two small hills that sat close together and from where the Italians were able to observe the Allied lines.<ref name=Saunders59>Saunders 1959, p. 59.</ref> 

It was to be a raid that was typical of what the men had been trained for, but which they had rarely been able to conduct since arriving in the Middle East.<ref name=Saunders59/>  

On the night of 17/18 July the detachment attacked the Italian position. It proved to be highly successful, being well-planned and executed. Using the cover of darkness and a carefully laid deception plan, the commandos managed to sneak up behind the Italians position on the hills, and move thorough the forward defensive pits unchallenged. In the end they advanced to within 30 yards of the headquarters before they were challenged, and when they finally were, the force rushed the Italian defenders with sub machine guns and grenades and quickly overwhelmed them.<ref name=Saunders60>Saunders 1959, p. 60.</ref> They then withdrew from the position just before the Italians could call down an artillery barrage and returned to the garrison holding Tobruk. They suffered five casualties in the raid, one of whom later died of his wounds.<ref name=Saunders60/>

===Disbandment===
Soon afterwards the Tobruk raid No. 8 (Guards) Commando was disbanded.<ref>Chappell 1996, p. 17.</ref> Its parent formation, Layforce, suffering from the losses suffered in the early raids and the evacuation from Crete, and stymied by lack of resources, changing strategic needs and a lack of enthusiasm for their employment by parts of the British high command, became ineffective and was itself disbanded in August.<ref>Parker 2000, p. 53.</ref> Shortly after this, though, upon the insistence of Sir [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Middle East Commando]] was raised from the remnants of Layforce<ref>Parker 2000, p. 54.</ref> and some of No. 8 (Guards) Commando's personnel transferred this unit, while others, including [[David Stirling]], [[Randolph Churchill]] and Roger Courtney went on to become part of other special forces units such as the [[Special Air Service]], the [[Special Boat Section]] or the [[Long Range Desert Group]] .<ref>Shortt and McBride 1981, p. 6 & 9.</ref>
