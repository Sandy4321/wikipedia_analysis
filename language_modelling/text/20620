{{DISPLAYTITLE: C<sub>4</sub> carbon fixation}}
'''C<sub>4</sub> carbon fixation''' is one of three biochemical mechanisms, along with [[C3 carbon fixation|{{c3}}]] and [[Crassulacean acid metabolism|CAM photosynthesis]], used in [[carbon fixation]].  It is named for the 4-carbon molecule present in the first product of carbon fixation in the small subset of plants known as C<sub>4</sub> plants, in contrast to the 3-carbon molecule products in {{c3}} plants.

{{c4}} fixation is an elaboration of the more common {{c3}} carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently. {{c4}} and CAM overcome the tendency of the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in what is called [[photorespiration]]. This is achieved by using a more efficient enzyme to fix {{co2}} in [[mesophyll cell]]s and shuttling this fixed carbon via [[malate]] or asparate to [[bundle-sheath]] cells. In these bundle-sheath cells, RuBisCO is isolated from atmospheric oxygen and saturated with the {{co2}} released by [[decarboxylation]] of the malate or oxaloacetate.  These additional steps, however, require more energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Because of this extra energy requirement, {{c4}} plants are able to more efficiently fix carbon in only certain conditions, with the more common {{c3}} pathway being more efficient in other conditions.

The first experiments indicating that some plants do not use the established
[[C3 carbon fixation]] but produce [[malate]] and [[aspartate]] in the first step were done in the 1950s and early 1960s by [[Hugo P. Kortschak]]<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00014751 | title = A tribute to Hugo P.

R. Slack, in Australia, in 1966, so it is sometimes called the Hatch-Slack pathway.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/103/0660/1030660.pdf|pmid=4292834 |title=Comparative studies on the activity of carboxylases and other enzymes in relation to the new pathway of photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation in tropical grasses |year=1967|volume=103|page=660 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-08|last1=Slack|first1=CR|last2=Hatch|first2=MD|issue=3|pmc=1270465|journal=The Biochemical journal|pages=660<U+2013>5}}</ref>

In [[C3 plants|{{c3}} plants]], the first step in the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis involves the fixation of {{co2}} by the enzyme [[RuBisCO]] into [[3-phosphoglycerate]]. However, due to the dual [[carboxylase]] / [[oxygenase]] activity of [[RuBisCo]], an amount of the substrate is [[redox|oxidized]] rather than [[carboxylation|carboxylated]], resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as [[photorespiration]].
In order to bypass the [[photorespiration]] pathway, {{c4}} plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver {{co2}} to the [[RuBisCO]] enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the [[mesophyll]] cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the [[bundle sheath]] cells as well. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the [[Calvin cycle]], {{co2}} is incorporated into a 4-carbon [[organic acid]], which has the ability to regenerate {{co2}} in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this {{co2}} to generate carbohydrates by the conventional [[C3 pathway|{{c3}} pathway]].

The first step in the pathway is the conversion of [[pyruvate]] to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), by the enzyme [[pyruvate phosphate dikinase|pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase]].  This reaction requires inorganic phosphate and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] plus [[pyruvate]], producing [[phosphoenolpyruvate]], [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]], and inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi).  The next step is the fixation of {{co2}} into [[Oxaloacetic_acid|oxaoloacetate]] by the enzyme [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase|PEP carboxylase]]. Both of these steps occur in the mesophyll cells:
:pyruvate + Pi + ATP <U+2192> PEP + AMP + PPi
:PEP + CO<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> oxaloacetate

PEP carboxylase has a lower [[Michaelis-Menten kinetics|Km]] for {{co2}} <U+2014> and, hence, higher affinity <U+2014> than RuBisCO. Furthermore, O<SUB>2</SUB> is a very poor substrate for this enzyme. Thus, at relatively low concentrations of {{co2}}, most {{co2}} will be fixed by this pathway.

The product is usually converted to [[malate]], a simple [[organic compound]], which is transported to the bundle-sheath cells surrounding a nearby [[vein]].  Here, it is decarboxylated to produce {{CO2}} and [[pyruvate]].  The {{co2}} now enters the [[Calvin cycle]] and the pyruvate is transported back to the [[mesophyll]] cell.

Since every {{co2}} molecule has to be fixed twice, first by 4-carbon organic acid and second by RuBisCO, the {{c4}} pathway uses more energy than the {{c3}} pathway. The {{c3}} pathway requires 18 molecules of ATP for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose, whereas the {{c4}} pathway requires 30 molecules of ATP. This energy debt is more than paid for by avoiding losing more than half of photosynthetic carbon in [[photorespiration]] as occurs in some tropical plants,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} making it an adaptive mechanism for minimizing the loss.

There are several variants of this pathway:
#The 4-carbon acid transported from mesophyll cells may be malate, as above, or [[aspartate]]
#The 3-carbon acid transported back from bundle-sheath cells may be pyruvate, as above, or [[alanine]]
#The enzyme that catalyses decarboxylation in bundle-sheath cells differs. In maize and sugarcane, the enzyme is NADP-malic enzyme; in millet, it is NAD-malic enzyme; and, in ''[[Panicum maximum]]'', it is PEP carboxykinase.

=={{c4}} leaf anatomy==

The {{c4}} plants often possess a characteristic [[leaf]] anatomy. Their vascular bundles are surrounded by two rings of cells, the inner ring, called bundle sheath cells, contain [[starch]]-rich [[chloroplast]]s lacking grana, which differ from those in [[mesophyll]] cells present as the outer ring. Hence, the chloroplasts are called dimorphic. This peculiar anatomy is called ''kranz anatomy'', from the German word for [[wreath]]. The primary function of kranz anatomy is to provide a site in which {{co2}} can be concentrated around RuBisCO, thereby avoiding [[photorespiration]]. In order to maintain a significantly higher {{co2}} concentration in the bundle sheath compared to the mesophyll, the boundary layer of the kranz has a low conductance to {{co2}}, a property that may be enhanced by the presence of [[suberin]].<ref>Laetsch (1971) Photosynthesis and Photorespiration, eds Hatch, Osmond and Slatyer</ref>

Although most {{c4}} plants exhibit kranz anatomy, there are many species that operate a limited {{c4}} cycle without any distinct bundle sheath tissue. ''[[Suaeda aralocaspica]]'', ''[[Bienertia]] cycloptera'' and ''Bienertia sinuspersici'' (all [[Chenopodioideae|chenopods]]) are terrestrial plants that inhabit dry, salty depressions in the deserts of south-east Asia. These plants have been shown to operate single-cell {{c4}} {{co2}}-concentrating mechanisms, which are unique among the known {{c4}} mechanisms.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/aob/mcn158 |title=Germination of Dimorphic Seeds of the Desert Annual Halophyte Suaeda aralocaspica (Chenopodiaceae), a C4 Plant without Kranz Anatomy|year=2008|last1=Wang|first1=L.|last2=Huang|first2=Z.|last3=Baskin|first3=C.

Carboxylation enzymes in the cytosol can, therefore, be kept separate from decarboxylase enzymes and RuBisCO in the chloroplasts, and a diffusive barrier can be established between the chloroplasts (which contain RuBisCO) and the cytosol. This enables a bundle-sheath-type area and a mesophyll-type area to be established within a single cell. Although this does allow a limited {{c3}} cycle to operate, it is relatively inefficient, with the occurrence of much leakage of {{co2}} from around RuBisCO. There is also evidence for the exhibiting of inducible {{c4}} photosynthesis by non-kranz aquatic [[macrophyte]] ''[[Hydrilla verticillata]]'' under warm conditions, although the mechanism by which {{co2}} leakage from around RuBisCO is minimised is currently uncertain.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1104/pp.65.2.331|title=C4 Acid Metabolism and Dark CO2 Fixation in a Submersed Aquatic Macrophyte (Hydrilla verticillata)|year=1980|last1=Holaday|first1=A.

==The evolution and advantages of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway==
{{See|Evolutionary history of plants#Evolution of photosynthetic pathways}}
{{c4}} plants have a competitive advantage over plants possessing the more common [[C3 carbon fixation|C<sub>3</sub> carbon fixation]] pathway under conditions of [[drought]], high [[temperature]]s, and [[nitrogen]] or {{co2}} limitation. When grown in the same environment, at 30<U+00B0>C, {{c3}} grasses lose approximately 833 molecules of water per {{co2}} molecule that is fixed, whereas {{c4}} grasses lose only 277 water molecules per {{co2}} molecule fixed. This increased water use efficiency of {{c4}} grasses means that soil moisture is conserved, allowing them to grow for longer in arid environments.<ref name=sage>{{cite book|last=Sage|first=Rowan|coauthors=Russell Monson|title=C4 Plant Biology|year=1999|pages=228<U+2013>229|chapter=7|isbn=0-12-614440-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H7Wv9ZImW-QC&pg=PA228}}</ref>

Present-day {{C4}} plants are concentrated in the tropics (below latitudes of 45<U+00B0>) where the high air temperature contributes to higher possible levels of oxygenase activity by [[RuBisCO]], which increases rates of photorespiration in {{c3}} plants.

==Plants that use {{c4}} carbon fixation==
About 7600 species of plants use {{c4}} carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants.  All these 7600 species are [[angiosperm]]s. {{c4}} carbon fixation is less common in [[dicot]]s than in [[monocot]]s, with only 4.5% of dicots using the {{c4}} pathway, compared to 40% of monocots. Despite this, only three [[family (biology)|families]] of monocots utilise {{c4}} carbon fixation compared to 15 dicot families. Of the monocot clades containing {{c4}} plants, the  grass ([[Poaceae]]) species use the {{c4}} photosynthetic pathway most. Forty-six percent of grasses <!--or "46% Of grasses": first letter of a sentence is capitalized-->are {{c4}} and together account for 61% of {{c4}} species. These include the food crops [[Zea mays|maize]], [[sugar cane]], [[millet]], and [[sorghum]].<ref name=sage>{{cite book|last=Sage|first=Rowan|coauthors=Russell Monson|title=C4 Plant Biology|year=1999|pages=551<U+2013>580|chapter=16|isbn=0-12-614440-0|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H7Wv9ZImW-QC&pg=PA551}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Zhu, Xin-Guang,Long, Stephen P;Ort, R Donald|title=What is the maximum efficiency with which photosynthesis can convert solar energy into biomass?|year=2008|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=19|pages=153<U+2013>159|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2008.02.004| pmid=18374559| issue=2}}</ref> Of the dicot clades containing {{c4}} species, the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Caryophyllales]] contains the most species.
