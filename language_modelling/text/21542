"'''Electricity'''" is the debut single of the [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[synthpop]] group [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. It is notable for having been recorded numerous times. The earliest versions are live recordings by [[Andy McCluskey]] and [[Paul Humphreys]]' previous group '''The Id'''. The song is one of the OMD's most popular and recognisable songs even though it never became a hit. The three attempts at scoring a hit only achieved the lowly (but significant for the group at the time) #99 in 1979<ref name="OffWebDisc3">{{cite web |url=http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/singles/html/s_5.html |title=Official OMD website discography entry for third issue. |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>. "Electricity" would later appear on OMD's [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (album)|debut album]] and is regularly featured on OMD compilations.

All incarnations of the "Electricity" single were backed by the B-side and fellow debut album track "Almost." This song was inspired by [[The Teardrop Explodes|The Teardrop Explodes']] song "Camera, Camera"<ref name="OffWebDisc1">{{cite web |url=http://www.omd.uk.com/discography/singles/html/s_1.html |title=Official OMD website discography entry for first issue. |accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> and the [[Kraftwerk]] song "Radioactivity." <ref> [http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17624 Electricity Songfacts] </ref>

=="Electricity" and "Almost" versions==

There are many different versions of the two songs that were present on OMD's debut single. After the band left [[Factory Records]], DinDisc attempted twice to score a hit with "Electricity". Consequently, four versions of "Electricity" and three of "Almost" exist.

'''Version I''':  "Electricity" and "Almost" were originally recorded at Cargo Studios, Rochdale and produced by [[Martin Hannett]] under the [[moniker]] Martin Zero, to be released by [[Factory Records]]. 

'''Version II''':  The band felt Hannett had overproduced their songs somewhat, so they recorded new versions at Henry's Studio, Liverpool. These versions were produced by themselves and band manager [[Paul Collister]] under the moniker Chester Valentino.

A compromise was reached for the versions used on the single. This first Factory single contains the band's version of "Electricity" and the Hannett version of "Almost".<ref name="OffWebDisc1"/>

Version II of "Almost" remained unreleased until appearing on the 2001 ''Navigation'' compilation.

'''Version III''':  The album versions of "Electricity" and "Almost" differ from the previous versions, and were used for the third and final release of the single. "Electricity" was remixed from the original Hannett version. It's also the version used on the 1988 ''[[The Best of OMD|Best Of]]'' and the 1998 ''[[The OMD Singles|Singles]]'' collections and is the best known version of the song<ref name="OffWebDisc3"/>. The album version of "Almost" is similarly a remix of Hannett's version. 

'''Version IV''' ("Electricity" only): A fourth mix of "Electricity" was produced by [[Mike Howlett]] and can be found as a bonus track on the re-issue of ''[[Organisation (album)|Organisation]]''. This version can be distinguished by its extended instrumental section in the middle, and is unique to this release.

==Sleeve design==
The sleeve was designed by Factory's designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]]. The band and Saville met in a Rochdale pub and exchanged ideas. Saville told them about a book of avant-garde musical scores which he'd come across. Andy McCluskey said that he sometimes wrote down the tunes he composed in a similar shorthand. This led to the unusual graphics that feature on the sleeve. Saville suggested to use shiny black ink on black paper. Both OMD and [[Tony Wilson]] didn't believe it could be done, but Saville persuaded a printer to do the job. The [[thermographic printing]] was a success, but the place set on fire three times, so eventually only 5000 sleeves were printed.<ref>Taylor, Steve, ''Industrial manoeuvres in the art'', The Face, no. 10, February 1981, pp. 50-53</ref> The reissue sleeves were standard white on black printed sleeves.
