'''D124''' is a state road on [[Dugi Otok]] Island in [[Croatia]] connecting the [[D109 (Croatia)|D109 state road]] to [[Brbinj]] ferry port, from where [[Jadrolinija]] ferries fly to the mainland, docking in [[Zadar]] and the [[D407 (Croatia)|D407 state road]].<ref name="Jadrolinija">{{cite web | url = http://www.jadrolinija.hr/default.aspx?lang=2 | title = Jadrolinija ferry service | date = May 11, 2010}}</ref> The road is {{convert|1.7|km|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="NN-klasifikacija">{{cite news | newspaper = [[Narodne novine]] | language = Croatian | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2010_02_17_410.html | title = Decision on categorization of public roads as state roads, county roads and local roads | date = February 17, 2010}}</ref>

The road, as well as all other state roads in Croatia, is managed and maintained by [[Hrvatske ceste]], a state-owned company.<ref name="NN-PublicRoadsAct">{{cite news | newspaper = [[Narodne novine]] | language = Croatian | url = http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2004_12_180_3130.html | title = Public Roads Act | date = December 14, 2004}}</ref>

== Traffic volume ==

Traffic volume is not counted on the D124 road directly, however [[Hrvatske ceste]], operator of the road reports number of vehicles using Zadar <U+2013> Brbinj ferry line, connecting the D124 road to the [[D407 (Croatia)|D407 state road]].<ref name="HC-promet">{{cite web | publisher = [[Hrvatske ceste]] | url = http://www.hrvatske-ceste.hr/WEB%20-%20Legislativa/brojenje-prometa/CroDig2009.pdf | title = Traffic counting on the roadways of Croatia in 2009 <U+2013> digest | date = May 1, 2010}}</ref> Substantial variations between annual ([[AADT]]) and summer (ASDT) traffic volumes are attributed to the fact that the road connects a number of island resorts to the mainland.
