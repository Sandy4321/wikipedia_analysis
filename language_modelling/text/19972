'''''English Oceans''''' is the tenth [[studio album]] by American [[Southern rock]] band [[Drive-By Truckers]], released on March 4, 2014, by [[ATO Records]]. It was produced by long-time collaborator David Barbe and recorded during two weeks during the late spring of 2013.  Wes Freed once again provided the album's artwork and cover. ''English Oceans'' marks the first time the Drive-By Truckers returned to the studio in four years and is their only record with two songwriters. The cover art for this album is from a painting by Wes Freed based on of a photograph of Abby, Sylvie, and Grace Weissman. The girls' father, Barr Weissman, made the 2009 documentary about the Truckers and the family has remained close with the band. The original painting hangs in the family's living room. 

== Music and lyrics ==
While previous Drive-By Truckers records are largely dominated by guitarist Patterson Hood's songs, fellow guitarist Mike Cooley split song-writing duties with Hood for ''English Oceans''.<ref>Bernstein, Jonathan (December 3, 2013). [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/drive-by-truckers-return-to-simplicity-on-english-oceans-20131203 "Drive-By Truckers Return to Simplicity on ''English Oceans''"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved March 11, 2014.</ref> It also marks the first time that Cooley takes singing duties on a song written by Hood.

According to Chris Conaton of [[PopMatters]], their songs are character studies set to [[Southern rock]] music like on the band's previous albums,<ref name = "PopMatters">{{cite web|last=Conaton|first=Chris|date=March 3, 2014|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/179397-drive-by-truckers-english-oceans/|title=Drive-By Truckers: English Oceans|publisher=[[Popmatters]]|accessdate=March 13, 2014}}</ref> while ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Dave Simpson wrote that ''English Oceans'' is "full of their familiar southern rock: [[soul music|soul]] and [[brass instrument|brass]] occasionally adorn storytelling songs which attempt to right wrongs and champion the worker against [[The Man]]."<ref name="Guardian"/>
