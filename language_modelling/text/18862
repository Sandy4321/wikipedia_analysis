'''Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn Abu'l-Hayja 'Abdallah ibn Hamdan Nasir al-Dawla al-Taghlibi''', more commonly known simply by his ''[[laqab]]'' (honorific epithet) of '''Nasir al-Dawla''' ("Defender of the State"), was the second [[Hamdanid]] ruler of the [[Emirate of Mosul]], encompassing most of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]]. 

As the senior member of the Hamdanid dynasty, he inherited the family power base around [[Mosul]] from his father, and was able to secure it against challenges by his uncles. Hasan became involved in the court intrigues of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s court in [[Baghdad]], and in 942<U+2013>943, with the aid of his younger brother Ali (better known as [[Sayf al-Dawla]]), he was able to establish himself as ''[[amir al-umara]]'' (''de facto'' regent) over the Caliphate. He was driven back to Mosul by Turkish troops, however, and subsequent attempts to challenge the [[Buyids]] who seized control of Baghdad and lower [[Iraq]] ended in repeated failure. His power and prestige declined, and was eclipsed by the feats of his brother Ali, who established his rule over [[Aleppo]] and northern [[Syria]]. In 967, he was deposed and imprisoned by his sons, dying in captivity two years later.

== Life ==
===Origin and family===
Nasir al-Dawla was born al-Hasan ibn Abdallah, the eldest son of [[Abdallah ibn Hamdan|Abdallah Abu'l-Hayja ibn Hamdan]] (died 929), son of Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith, who gave his name to the [[Hamdanid dynasty]].<ref>Canard (1986), pp. 126, 127</ref> The Hamdanids were a branch of the [[Banu Taghlib]], an Arab tribe resident in the area of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia) since pre-Islamic times.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 265<U+2013>266</ref> The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled [[Mosul]] and its region until the late 9th century, when the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in his effort to fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance of the [[Kurds]] living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.<ref name="EI2-H126">Canard (1986), p. 126</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 269</ref> 

Hamdan was defeated in 895 and imprisoned with his relatives, but his son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan]] managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and the Arab and Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strenuous relationship with the central Abbasid government in [[Baghdad]] during the early 10th century.<ref name="EI2-H126"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 268</ref> Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the [[Kharijites]] and the [[Tulunids]], but being disgraced after supporting the failed usurpation of [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz|Ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim was governor of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] (the province around [[Nasibin]]) in 919 and after his death in the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud.<ref name="EI2-H126"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266<U+2013>267</ref> Al-Hasan's father Abdallah served as [[emir]] (governor) of [[Mosul]] in 905/6<U+2013>913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful [[Mu'nis al-Khadim]], he later played a leading role in the short-lived usurpation of [[Al-Qahir]] ([[reign]]ed 932<U+2013>934) against [[Al-Muqtadir]] (r. 908<U+2013>932) in 929, and was killed during its suppression.<ref>Canard (1986), pp. 126<U+2013>127</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 267<U+2013>268</ref> He was the most prominent member of the first generation of the Hamdanid dynasty, and was essentially the founder of the Hamdanid Emirate of Mosul.<ref name="EI2-H127">Canard (1986), p. 127</ref>

===Consolidation of control over the Jazira===
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids]]
During his absence in Baghdad in his final years from 920/921 on, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to al-Hasan.<ref>Kennedy (2004), p. 268</ref><ref name="EI2-994">Bowen (1993), p. 994</ref> After Abdallah's death, however, al-Muqtadir took the opportunity to avenge himself upon the Hamdanids, and appointed an unrelated governor over Mosul, while Abdallah's domains were divided among Abdallah's surviving brothers. Faced with the claims of his uncles, Hasan was left in charge of a small portion, on the left bank of the [[Tigris]].<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-994"/> In 930, after the Caliph's governor died,<ref name="EI2-994"/> Hasan managed to regain control over Mosul, but his uncles, Nasr and [[Sa'id ibn Hamdan|Sa'id]], soon evicted him and confined him to the western parts of the [[Diyar Rabi'a]]. In 934, Hasan again recovered Mosul, but by Sa'id, who resided in Baghdad and had the support of the caliphal government, evicted him again. Hasan fled to [[Armenia]], from where he got rid of his uncle by assassination. Only then did his troops, under his ''[[vizier|wazir]]'' Ibn Muqla, permanently occupy Mosul.<ref name="EI2-H127"/> Finally, after defeating caliphal forces and his rivals among the Taghlib, the [[Banu Habib]], in late 935 the Caliph [[al-Radi]] (r. 934<U+2013>940 was forced to formally recognize him as governor of Mosul and the entire Jazira, in exchange for an annual tribute of 70,000 [[gold dinar]]s and supplies of flour for the two caliphal capitals of Baghdad and [[Samarra]].<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Kennedy268">Kennedy (2004), p. 268</ref> 

Resistance to Hamdanid ruler outside their core province around Mosul remained, however: in [[Diyar Bakr]], the governor of [[Mayyafariqin]], Ali ibn Ja'far, had rebelled against al-Hasan, and in [[Diyar Mudar]], the [[Qays]]i tribes of the region around [[Saruj]] also proved rebellious. Al-Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira by the end of 936, chiefly through the agency of his brother, Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-104">Bianquis (1997), p. 104</ref> In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, went over to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. This unprecedented move may be accounted for by the fact that the tribe may have still been to a large degree Christian, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but it was mainly a move to escape from Hamdanid control and taxation.<ref name="Kennedy268"/> Al-Hasan also attempted to extend his control to [[Sajid]]-ruled [[Azerbaijan]] in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.<ref name="EI2-994"/>

===Struggle for control of the Caliphate===
While he tried to consolidate his rule over Mosul, al-Hasan showed himself conspicuously loyal to the Abbasid regime, and refused to support the revolt of [[Mu'nis al-Khadim]] against [[al-Muqtadir]].<ref name="EI2-994"/> After al-Muqtadir's death in 932, however, the Abbasid government all but collapsed, and in 936 the powerful governor of [[Wasit]], [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], assumed the title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' ("commander of commanders") and with it ''[[de facto]]'' control of the Abbasid government. The Caliph al-Radi was reduced to a figurehead role, while the extensive old civil bureaucracy was drastically reduced both in size and power.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 192<U+2013>195</ref> Ibn Ra'iq's position was anything but secure, however, and soon a convoluted struggle for control of the office, and the Caliphate, broke out among the various local rulers and the Turkish and [[Daylamite]] military chiefs, which ended in 946 with the victory of the [[Buyids]].<ref name="Bonner355-6">Bonner (2010), pp. 355<U+2013>356</ref><ref name="Kennedy195-6">Kennedy (2004), pp. 195<U+2013>196</ref> 

Exploiting the weakness of the caliphal government, in the late 930s, al-Hasan became involved in the intrigues of the Abbasid court, and became one of the many contenders fot the title of ''amir al-umara''.<ref name="EI2-H127"/> At first, al-Hasan tried to exploit the weakness of the Abbasid government to withhold his payment of tribute, but the Turk [[Bajkam]], who had ousted Ibn Ra'iq in 938, quickly forced him to back down.<ref name="EI2-994"/> Al-Hasan then supported Ibn Ra'iq in the latter's quest to regain his lost position. Bajkam tried to evict al-Hasan from his Jaziran domains, but in vain, and was murdered in early 941.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Kennedy195-6"/><ref name="Bonner355">Bonner (2010), p. 355</ref> The Hamdanid's great chance came in early 942, when the Caliph [[al-Muttaqi]] (r. 940<U+2013>944) and his closest aides fled Baghdad to escape the city's fall to the [[Barids]] of [[Basra]] and sought refuge at Mosul. Al-Hasan now made a direct bid for power: he had Ibn Ra'iq assassinated and succeeded him as ''amir al-umara'', receiving the honorific ''[[laqab]]'' of ''Nasir al-Dawla'' ("Defender of the State"). He then escorted the Caliph back to Baghdad, which they entered on 4 June 942. To secure his position further, Nasir al-Dawla married his daughter to the Caliph's son.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Bonner355"/><ref>Bowen (1993), pp. 994<U+2013>995</ref> Along with their cousin, Husayn ibn Sa'id, Nasir al-Dawla's brother Ali was instrumental in the Hamdanid enterprise, taking the field against the Baridis, who still controled the rich province of Basra and were determined to regain Baghdad. After scoring a victory over them, Ali was awarded the ''laqab'' of Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the State"), by which he became famous. This double award marked the first time that a ''laqab'' incorporating the prestigious element ''Dawla'' were granted to anyone other than the ''wazir'', the Caliphate's chief minister.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-104"/><ref name="Kennedy270">Kennedy (2004), p. 270</ref> 

The Hamdanids' success and rule over the Abbasid capital lasted for little more than a year. They lacked funds and were politically isolated, finding little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the [[Samanids]] of [[Transoxiana]] and the [[Ikhshidids]] of [[Egypt]]. Consequently, when in late 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, [[Daylamites]], [[Carmathians]] and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turkish general [[Tuzun]], they were forced to quit Baghdad and return to their base, Mosul.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Kennedy270"/><ref name="EI2-995">Bowen (1993), p. 995</ref> Caliph al-Muttaqi now appointed Tuzun as ''amir al-umara'', but the Turk's overbearing manner induced al-Muttaqi to once again seek refuge in the Hamdanid court. The Hamdanid forces under Sayf al-Dawla took the field against Tuzun's army, but were defeated. The Hamdanids now concluded an agreement with Tuzun which allowed them to keep the Jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern Syria (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for an annual tribute of 3.6 million ''[[dirham]]s''.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Kennedy270"/><ref name="EI2-995"/> 

In the meantime, the Caliph was brought to [[al-Raqqah]] for greater safety, while Husayn ibn Sa'id tried to secure control over northern [[Syria]] and preempt [[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid|al-Ikhshid]] taking control of the region. The attempt failed, as al-Ikhshid himself advanced into Syria, took [[Aleppo]] and marched to Raqqah, where he met the Caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried to persuade al-Muttaqi to come to Egypt under his protection, but the Caliph refused, and al-Ikhsid returned to Egypt. Instead, al-Muttaqi, persuaded by Tuzun's assurances of loyalty and safety, returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, replacing him with [[Al-Mustakfi]] (r. 944<U+2013>946).<ref name="Bonner355-6"/><ref name="EI2-995"/><ref name="Kennedy196">Kennedy (2004), p. 196</ref> At the news of this crime, Nasir al-Dawla again refused payment of tribute, but Tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance.<ref name="EI2-995"/> Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad, but he would find it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over the city he once ruled, and the subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 270<U+2013>271</ref>

===Wars with the Buyids===
In late 945, Tuzun died. His death weakened the Abbasid government's ability to maintain its independence against the rising power of the Buyids, who under Ahmad ibn Buya had already consolidated control over [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman Province|Kerman]], and secured the cooperation of the Barids. Al-Mustakfi's secretary, Ibn Shirzad, tried to confront the Buyids by calling upon Nasir al-Dawla, but Ahmad advanced on Baghdad with his troops, and in January 946 he secured his appointment as ''amir al-umara'' with the honorific [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] ("Strengthener of the State").<ref name="Kennedy196"/><ref name="EI2-995"/><ref>Bonner (2010), p. 356</ref> To secure their position, the Buyids immediately marched against the Hamdanids. Nasir al-Dawla countered by marching down the eastern bank of the [[Tigris]] river and blockading Baghdad. In the end, however, the Buyids [[Battle of Baghdad (946)|defeated]] the Hamdanids in battle and forced Nasir al-Dawla to retire to [[Ukbara]].<ref name="EI2-995"/> From there, Nasir al-Dawla began negotiations with the Buyids, aiming to secure recognition of Hamdanid control over the Jazira, Syria and even Egypt as tributaries of the Caliphate, with the boundary between Buyid and Hamdanid spheres placed at [[Tikrit]]. Negotiations were disrupted by a rebellion among the Hamdanids' Turkish troops, but Mu'izz al-Dawla, who for the moment preferred a stable Hamdanid state to anarchy, helped Nasir al-Dawla suppress it. The peace was agreed on the terms outlined above, and was affirmed by one of Nasir al-Dawla's sons being taken as a hostage to Baghdad.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-995"/>

Conflict between the two rivals was renewed in 948, when Mu'izz al-Dawla again marched against Mosul, but was forced to cut off his campaign to assist his brother [[Rukn al-Dawla]], who was having trouble in [[Persia]]. In exchange, Nasir al-Dawla agreed to recommence the payment of tribute for the Jazira and Syria, as well as to add the names of the three Buyid brothers after that of the Caliph in the [[Friday prayer]].<ref name="EI2-995"/> Another round of warfare erupted in 956<U+2013>958. While the Buyids were preoccupied with the rebellion of their [[Daylamite]] troops under Rezbahan ibn Vindadh-Khursid in southern Iraq, Nasir al-Dawla the opportunity to advance south and capture Baghdad. After the suppression of the Daylamite revolt, however, the Hamdanids were not able to maintain their position in the face of the Buiyd counteroffensive, and abandoned the city.<ref name="EI2-995"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 221, 271</ref> Peace was renewed in exchange for the recommencement of tribute and an additional [[indemnity]], but when Nasir al-Dawla refused to send the second year's payment, the Buyid ruler advanced north. Unable to confront the Buyid army in the field, Nasir al-Dawla abandoned Mosul and fled to [[Mayyafariqin]] and then to his brother Sayf al-Dawla in Aleppo. The Buyids captured osul and [[Nasibin]], but the Hamdanids and their supporters withdrew to their home territory in the mountains of the north, taking with them their treasures as well as all government records and tax registers. As a result, the Buyid army was unable to support itself in the conquered territory, all the more since the predominantly Daylamite troops were resented by the local people, who launched [[guerrilla]] attacks on them.<ref name="EI2-995"/><ref name="Kennedy271">Kennedy (2004), p. 271</ref> Sayf al-Dawla tried to mediate with Mu'izz al-Dawla, but his first approaches were rebuffed. Only when he agreed to assume the burden of paying his brother's tribute for [[Diyar Rabi'a]], did the Buyid ruler agree to peace. This agreement marks the reversal of fortune between the two Hamdanid brothers, and the establishment of the predominance of the family's Syrian branch.<ref name="EI2-995"/><ref name="Kennedy271"/>

In 964, Nasir al-Dawla tried to renegotiate the terms of the arrangement, but also tried to secure Buyid recognition for his eldest son, [[Abu Taghlib|Fadl Allah Abu Taghlib al-Ghadanfar]], as his successor. Mu'izz al-Dawla refused Nasir al-Dawla's demands, and again invaded Hamdanid territory. Once again Mosul and Nasibin were captured, while the Hamdanids fled to the mountain fortresses. As in 958, the Buyids were unable to maintain themselves for long in the Jazira, and soon an agreement was reached which allowed the Hamdanids to return to Mosul. This time, however, Abu Taghlib emerged as the effective leader in his father's place, as Mui'zz al-Dawla concluded a treaty with him and not the aged Nasir al-Dawla.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-995"/><ref name="Kennedy271"/> The end of Nasir al-Dawla's rule came in 967, in the same year that his brother Sayf al-Dawla and his great rival Mu'izz al-Dawla also died. Nasir al-Dawla was reportedly so much affected by his brother's death, that he lost interest in life and became remote and avaricious. In the end, Abu Taghlib, already the ''de facto'' governor of the Jazira, deposed him with the aid of his mother, Fatima bint Ahmad. Nasir al-Dawla tried to counter them by turning to one of his other sons, but he was seized and imprisoned in the fortress of Ardumusht, where he died in 968 or 969.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="EI2-995"/><ref name="Kennedy271"/>
