In 1964, 23-year-old Brodsky was arrested and charged with the crime of "[[Parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]]"<ref>{{cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|title=Gulag Lite|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2010/12/20/101220taco_talk_remnick?printable=true|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=December 20, 2010}}</ref> He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1972 and settled in America with the help of [[W.

Brodsky was awarded the 1987 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for an all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1987|publisher=Nobelprize|date=October 7, 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1987/|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> He was appointed [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|American Poet Laureate]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Poet Laureate Timeline: 1981-1990 | url=http://www.loc.gov/poetry/laureate-1991-2000.html | publisher=Library of Congress | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

==Early years==
Brodsky was born into a Jewish family in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. His father, Aleksandr Brodsky,  was a professional photographer in the Soviet Navy and his mother Maria Volpert Brodsky was a professional interpreter, whose work often helped to support the family. They lived in communal apartments, in poverty, marginalized by their Jewish status.<ref Name="Oxford">Cole, Henri  "Brodsky, Joseph". ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry in English''. Ian Hamilton. Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> In early childhood Brodsky survived the [[Siege of Leningrad]] where he and his parents nearly died of starvation, and later he suffered from various health problems caused by the siege.  Brodsky commented that many of his teachers were anti-Semitic and that he felt like a dissident from an early age. He noted "I began to despise Lenin, even when I was in the first grade, not so much because of his political philosophy or practice [...] but because of his omnipresent images."<ref Name="NYTobit4">[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/arts/joseph-brodsky-exiled-poet-who-won-nobel-dies-at-55.html?pagewanted=4 Obituary pp 4-6] ''[[New York Times]]'' "Joseph Brodsky, Exiled Poet Who Won Nobel, Dies at 55" 29 January 1996.</ref>

At fifteen, Brodsky left school and tried to enter the School of Submariners without success. He went on to work as a milling machine operator.<ref Name="Oxford"/> Later, having decided to become a physician, he worked at the morgue at the [[Kresty]] prison, cutting and sewing bodies.<ref Name="Oxford"/> He subsequently held a variety of jobs in hospitals, in a ship's boiler room, and on geological expeditions. At the same time, Brodsky engaged in a program of self-education. He learned Polish so he could translate the works of Polish poets like [[Czes<U+0142>aw Mi<U+0142>osz]], and English so he could translate [[John Donne]], acquiring a deep interest in classical philosophy, religion, mythology, and English and American poetry.<ref Name="NYTobit4"/>

==Career and family==
[[File:BrodskySimun.jpg||thumb|''Memorial to Brodsky,  in the patio of philological faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University]], by [[Konstantin Simun]]'']]
In 1955, Brodsky began writing his own poetry and producing literary translations, circulating them in secret, some published by the underground journal ''[[Sintaksis]]''.<ref Name="NYTobit4"/>His writings were apolitical. The young Brodsky met the great poet of the Silver age [[Anna Akhmatova]] in 1960.<ref Name="Oxford"/> She encouraged his work, and would go on to become his mentor.<ref name="timeliness"/> By 1958 he was already well known in literary circles for his poems "The Jewish cemetery near Leningrad" and "Pilgrims".<ref Name="Memoir"/> Asked when he first felt called to poetry, he recollected, "In 1959, in [[Yakutsk]], when walking in that terrible city, I went into a bookstore. I snagged a copy of poems by Baratynsky. I had nothing to read. So I read that book and finally understood what I had to do in life. Or got very excited, at least. So in a way, [[Yevgeny Baratynsky|Evgeny Abramovich Baratynsky]] is sort of responsible". His friend Ludmila Shtern recalled working with Brodsky on an irrigation project in his "Geological Period" (working as a geologist's assistant): "We bounced around the Leningrad Province examining kilometers of canals, checking their embankments, which looked terrible. They were falling down, coming apart, had all sorts of strange things growing in them. [...] It was during these trips, however, that I was privileged to hear the poems "The Hills" and "You Will Gallop in the Dark." Brodsky read them aloud to me between two train cars as we were going towards [[Tikhvin]].<ref Name="Memoir">Shtern, Ludmila  (2004)  ''Brodsky: a personal memoir'' Baskerville Publishers p. 63 ISBN 978-1880909706</ref>

In 1962, in Saint Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova introduced Brodsky to the artist Marina Basmanova.<ref name="nevanews.com">Zhdanova, Natalia, [http://www.nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=666&section=13 "Timelessness: Water Frees Time from Time Itself"], ''Neva News'', St Petersburg, Russia, 1 August 2007</ref> From then until his exile in 1972 they were occasional partners and together they had a son, Andrey, registered under her surname.<ref name="nevanews.com"/> A severe disruption in their relations occurred on New Year's Eve at the end of 1963, when Basmanova, whom Brodsky (who had fled to Moscow to avoid arrest) had left in the care of his friend and fellow poet [[Dmitri Bobyshev]], slept with Bobyshev; as soon as Brodsky heard of this, he hurried back to Leningrad and confronted them, breaking off relations with Bobyshev. Basmanova later joined Brodsky in his sentence in Archangelsk, disappearing from time to time to rejoin Bobyshev, but she refused to marry Brodsky or join him when he was exiled from the country.<ref>[[Keith Gessen]], "The Gift: Joseph Brodsky and the Fortunes of Misfortune," ''The New Yorker'', May 23, 2011, pp. 77 ff.; [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2011/05/23/110523crat_atlarge_gessen online] (accessed May 26, 2011).</ref><ref>[http://interviewmg.ru/229/ <U+0418><U+043E><U+0441><U+0438><U+0444> <U+0411><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0411><U+0430><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>. <U+0420><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0432> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0445> <U+0438> <U+0430><U+043A><U+0432><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+043B><U+044F><U+0445>], ''Interview'' magazine: "<U+0412> <U+0447><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0435> <U+044D><U+0442><U+0438><U+0445> <U+0432><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0435><U+0447> <U+0438> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0449><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0432> 1968 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0443> <U+0443> <U+0411><U+0430><U+0441><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+0411><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0438><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0441><U+044B><U+043D> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439>. <U+041F><U+043E><U+044D><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+044F><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F>, <U+0447><U+0442><U+043E> <U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+044C>-<U+0442><U+043E> <U+0443><U+0436> <U+041C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0441><U+043E><U+0433><U+043B><U+0430><U+0441><U+0438><U+0442><U+0441><U+044F> <U+043E><U+0444><U+0438><U+0446><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E> <U+043E><U+0444><U+043E><U+0440><U+043C><U+0438><U+0442><U+044C> <U+043E><U+0442><U+043D><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F>, <U+043D><U+043E> <U+043E><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0431><U+044B><U+043B><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+043A><U+043B><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430>."</ref>

===Denunciation===
In 1963, Brodsky's poetry was denounced by a Leningrad newspaper as "pornographic and anti-Soviet." His papers were confiscated, he was interrogated, twice put in a mental institution<ref Name="NYTobit"/>  and then arrested. He was charged with [[parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]] by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities in a trial in 1964, finding that his series of odd jobs and role as a poet were not a sufficient contribution to society.<ref Name="Oxford"/> <ref>Cissie Dore Hill (trans.)[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3493691.html ''Remembering Joseph Brodsky'']. [[Hoover Institution]]</ref> They called him "a pseudo-poet in velveteen trousers" who failed to fulfill his "constitutional duty to work honestly for the good of the motherland."<ref Name="NYTobit"/> The trial judged asked "Who has recognized you as a poet? Who has enrolled you in the ranks of poets?" <U+2014> "No one," Brodsky replied, "Who enrolled me in the ranks of the human race?"<ref Name="NYTobit4"/> For his "parasitism" Brodsky was sentenced to five years hard labor and served 18 months on a farm in the arctic [[Archangelsk]] region where he chopped wood, hauled manure and crushed rocks, and at night read his anthology of English and American poetry, including Auden and [[Robert Frost]].  Brodsky<U+2019>s mentor, Anna Akhmatova, laughed at the K.G.B.<U+2019>s shortsightedness. <U+201C>What a biography they<U+2019>re fashioning for our red-haired friend!<U+201D> she said. <U+201C>It<U+2019>s as if he<U+2019>d hired them to do it on purpose.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|last=Remnick|first=David|title=Gulag Lite|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2010/12/20/101220taco_talk_remnick|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=December 20, 2010}}</ref> 

His sentence was commuted in 1965 after protests by prominent Soviet and foreign cultural figures, including [[Evgeny Evtushenko]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] as well as Akhmatova <ref Name="Oxford"/> <ref name="timeliness">[http://www.nevanews.com/index.php?id_article=666&section=13 NevaNews.com "Timelessness: Water Frees Time from Time Itself." Natalia Zhdanova. 1 August 2007. Neva News ]. Accessed 2010-10-21</ref> Brodsky became a cause celebre in the West also when a secret transcription of trial minutes was smuggled out of the country, making him a symbol of artistic resistance in a totalitarian society, much like his mentor Akhmatova.

Brodsky returned to Leningrad and continued to write over the next seven years, many of his works being translated into German, French and English and published abroad. ''Verses and Poems'' was published by Inter-Language Literary Associates in Washington in 1965, ''Elegy to [[John Donne]] and Other Poems'' was published in London in 1967 by Longmans Green, and ''A Stop in the Desert'' was issued in 1970 by Chekhov Publishing in New York. Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret  ([[samizdat]]) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel. In 1972, while Brodsky was being considered for exile, the authorities consulted mental health expert  [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], a key proponent of the notorious pseudo-medical diagnosis of "paranoid reformist delusion".<ref name="Brintlinger">{{cite book|last1=Brintlinger|first1=Angela|last2=Vinitsky|first2=Ilya|title=Madness and the mad in Russian culture|year=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802091407|pages=92|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ED3U_XVLwHwC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> This political tool allowed the state to lock up dissenters in psychiatric institutions indefinitely. Without examining him personally, Snezhnevsky diagnosed Brodsky as having [[schizophrenia]], concluding that he was "not valuable person at all and may be let go."<ref name="Brintlinger"/> In 1971, Brodsky was twice invited to emigrate to Israel. When called to the Ministry of the Interior in 1972 and asked why he had not accepted, he stated that he wished to stay in the country. Within 10 days officials broke into his apartment, took his papers, and on 4 June 1972 put him on a plane for Vienna.<ref Name="NYTobit4"/> 

In Austria, he met Carl Proffer and Auden, who would both help in Brodsky's transit to America and prove influential to Brodsky's career. Proffer of the University of Michigan, one of the co-founders of [[Ardis Publishers]], became Brodsky's Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented "I knew I was leaving my country for good, but for where, I had no idea whatsoever. One thing which was quite clear was that I didn't want to go to Israel... I never even believed that they'd allow me to go. I never believed they would put me on a plane, and when they did I didn't know whether the plane would go east or west... I didn't want to be hounded by what was left of the Soviet Security Service in England. So I came to the States."  <ref Name="Haven">Haven (2006) p84</ref> Although the poet was invited back after the fall of the Soviet Union, Brodsky never returned to his country.<ref Name="NYTobit4"/>  <ref>Loseff, Lev (2010) ''Joseph Brodsky: a Literary Life'' Yale University Press (New Haven, CT)</ref>

=== America ===
[[Image:brodskygrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brodsky in [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]]]]
After a short stay in Vienna, Brodsky settled in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], with the help of poet Auden and Proffer and became poet in residence at the [[University of Michigan]] for a year.<ref Name="Haven"/> Brodsky went on to become a Visiting Professor at [[Queens College]] (1973<U+2013>74), [[Smith College]], [[Columbia University]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], later returning to the University of Michigan (1974<U+2013>80). He was the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Andrew Mellon Professor of Literature]] and Five College Professor of Literature at [[Mount Holyoke College]], brought there by poet and historian [[Peter Viereck]].<ref>[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/russian/joseph_brodsky.html Profile] at [[Mount Holyoke College]]</ref> In 1978, Brodsky was awarded an honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]] at [[Yale University]], and on 23 May 1979, he was inducted as a member of the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]. He moved to New York's Greenwich Village in 1980 and In 1981, Brodsky received the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]]'s "genius" award.<ref Name="Oxford"/> He was also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 1986, his collection of essays ''Less Than One'' won the [[National Book Critics Award]] for Criticism and he was given an honorary doctorate of literature from Oxford University.<ref Name="NYTobit"/>

In 1987, he won the [[Nobel Prize]] for Literature, the fifth Russian-born writer to do so. In an interview he was asked: "You are an American citizen who is receiving the Prize for Russian-language poetry. Who are you, an American or a Russian?" He responded: "I am Jewish <U+2013> a Russian poet and an English essayist".<ref>[http://yanko.lib.ru/books/non-fiction/brodsky_work_and_days.htm#_Toc19451734 ''Works and Days''. ''A Jew or a Hellene?''] chapter by [[Simon Markish]]</ref> The Academy stated that they had awarded the prize for his "all-embracing authorship, imbued with clarity of thought and poetic intensity." It also called his writing "rich and intensely vital," characterized by "great breadth in time and space." It was "a big step for me, a small step for mankind," he joked.<ref Name="NYTobit4"/> The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky's poetry as an exile.<ref name="OCEL"/>

[[File:Josef Brodsky.png|thumb|right|195px|Brodsky teaching at University of Michigan, 1972-1973]]
In 1991, Brodsky became [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]] of the United States. The [[Librarian of Congress]] said that Brodsky had "the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America".<ref Name="NYTobit4"/> His inauguration address was printed in ''Poetry Review''. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the [[University of Silesia]] in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour but he could not agree.<ref Name="NYTobit"/> For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a "fortune maker". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel "deathly tired" of it all towards the end.<ref>Stern (2004) p 305</ref> 

In the 1990s, Brodsky invited his son Andrey to visit him in New York for three months, and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Andrey married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrey and Brodsky's grand-children live in Saint Petersburg. In 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna. 

Brodsky died of a heart attack aged 55, in his [[New York City]] apartment on January 28, 1996. He had had open-heart surgery in 1979 and later two bypass operations, remaining in frail health since that time. He was buried in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] section at [[Isola di San Michele]] cemetery in [[Venice]], [[Italy]].<ref Name="NYTobit">[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/29/arts/joseph-brodsky-exiled-poet-who-won-nobel-dies-at-55.html?scp=5&sq=joseph+brodsky&st=nyt Obituary] ''[[New York Times]]'' "Joseph Brodsky, Exiled Poet Who Won Nobel, Dies at 55" 29 January 1996.</ref> In 1997, a plaque was placed on his house in St Petersburg (Leningrad) with his portrait in relief, and the words "In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky".<ref>Stern (2004) p 330</ref> Brodsky's close friend, the Nobel laureate [[Derek Walcott]], memorialized him in his collection ''The Prodigal'' (2004).

Brodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections ''A Part of Speech'' (1977) and  ''To Urania'' (1988) and the essay collection ''Less Than One'' (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play ''Marbles'' (1989) and ''Watermark'', a prose collection (1992).<ref Name="NYTobit"/> Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.

===Themes and forms===
In his introduction to Brodsky's ''Selected Poems'' (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W. H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by "encounters with nature, [...] reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence".<ref Name="Oxford"/> He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing "the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future".<ref Name="LOC"/> Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's " first volume of poetry in English, ''Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)'', shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms." <ref name="OCEL">"Brodsky, Joseph" ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press.</ref> 

''To Urania: Selected Poems 1965<U+2013>1985'' collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home and loss.<ref name="OCEL"/> His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as [[Osip Mandelshtam]], W. H. Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name="OCEL"/>

A recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to positively impact its audience and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the 20th century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]] and the [[World Wars]]. During his term as the Poet Laureate, Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Billington wrote "Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as "language's highest degree of maturity," and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. While poet laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity."<ref Name="LOC"/>

This passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as poet laureate in October, 1991. He says "By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. [...] In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. [...] Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon."<ref Name="LOC"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979 Brodsky reflected" In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some [[Seraphim|seraphical]] creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as "a read", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.

===Influences===
Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|Dr James Billington]], wrote "He was the favored prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [ [[Osip Mandelstam]] ]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots."<ref Name="LOC">[http://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 "Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>[http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf Martin, Eden (2007)  ''Collecting Anna Akhmatova''. ''The Caxtonian''  Vol. 4 April 2007, p.&nbsp;2] Journal of the [[Caxton Club]] Accessed 2010-10-21</ref>  Brodsky was also deeply influenced by the English metaphysical poets from [[John Donne]] to Auden. Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name="LOC"/>

Brodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]] and [[Richard Wilbur]]. Critic and poet [[Henri Cole]] notes that Brodsky's "own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality." <ref Name="Oxford"/>
