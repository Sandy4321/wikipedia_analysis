==Plot==

A political prisoner, Hwang-seok is released after 50 years of solitary confinement.  A day later, a body with stab wounds is recovered from a harbor.  Detective Oh investigates the death and determines the body is that of Yang, a former soldier.  Discovering a diary amongst Yang's possessions, Oh follows a trail of clues to a blind antique dealer, Ji-hye.  It transpires that it was Yang who was responsible for the imprisonment of Hwang-seok, a suspected communist sympathizer in the [[Korean War]].  This makes Hwang-seok the prime suspect for the murder of Yang.  But not all is as it seems, and a series of flashbacks back to the dark days of the Korean War and the infamous [[Geoje POW Camp]] on [[Geojedo|Geoje Island]] leads Oh to Han, a former North Korean soldier living in [[Japan]], and a final, tragic resolution for two il-fated lovers.
