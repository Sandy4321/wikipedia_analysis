The '''1970 Canada hurricane''' was an [[Tropical cyclone naming|unnamed]] [[tropical cyclone]] that brought impact to [[Bermuda]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The fourth hurricane and ninth tropical storm of the [[1970 Atlantic hurricane season|annual hurricane season]], this system developed northeast of the [[Bahamas]] as a [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical depression]] on October&nbsp;12. While tracking northeastward, the system intensified, becoming a subtropical storm on the following day. The subtropical storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone on October&nbsp;16, and strengthened into a hurricane about twelve hours later. The hurricane later bypassed [[Bermuda]], before further intensifying into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale]]. Thereafter, the hurricane accelerated rapidly northeastward, and made landfall on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] of Newfoundland as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane. It transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] early on October&nbsp;17.

The system produced tropical storm force winds on Bermuda, which caused the suspension of schools, transportation, and interrupted businesses, although minimal structural damage occurred. Light rainfall was also reported on the island. Hurricane force winds were observed throughout Newfoundland, which caused damage to structures, though mostly limited to broken windows. Rough seas damaged fishing dories and a fishing ramp on the Atlantic coast of the island. The cost of damage on the [[Burin Peninsula]] was estimated to be in the thousands of dollars, although the specific figure in unknown. Heavy rainfall was also reported in the region, with precipitation in [[Quebec]] reaching nearly {{convert|5|in|mm}}. On the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|French Territory]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], several buildings and houses lost their roof due to strong winds.

On October&nbsp;11, 1970, satellite images indicated that a tropical depression developed north of [[Hispaniola]].<ref name="NOAA">{{cite report|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/099/mwr-099-12-0966.pdf|title=The unnamed Atlantic Tropical Storms Of 1970|author=David B. Spiegler|date=December 1971|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|work=Allied Research Associates|accessdate=May 1, 2013|location=Concord, Massachusetts}}</ref> However, according to post-analysis, a subtropical depression actually formed on October&nbsp;12 at 1200&nbsp;UTC. The depression slowly intensified over the next few days, and became a subtropical storm on October&nbsp;12, thought this was operationally unnoticed by the [[National Hurricane Center]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} By October&nbsp;13, satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with the depression merged with a weak stationary front. As a result, the National Hurricane Center no longer considered it purely tropical and classified the system as a "subtropic storm" on October&nbsp;14.<ref name="NOAA"/> Later that day, the National Hurricane Center began issuing special bulletins for the storm, indicating the possibility of the system acquiring tropical characteristics.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0038-jpg/1970/atlantic/td%2337/public/pub141900z.jpg|title=Special Bulletin|author=[[Robert Simpson (meteorologist)|Robert H. Simpson]]|date=October 14, 1970|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=May 1, 2013|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> 

Early on October&nbsp;16, satellite imagery indicated that the storm was developing a cloud pattern typical of a normal tropical cyclone. In addition, [[Reconnaissance aircraft]] flight data indicated that a warm core was developing.<ref name="NOAA"/> As a result, the system had acquired enough characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000&nbsp;UTC on that day. Later that day, the storm strengthened enough to be upgraded to a hurricane at 1200&nbsp;UTC.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Six hours later, the system passed just west of Bermuda, although winds were well below hurricane force on the island. Spiral cloud bands and an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye feature]] were observed on radars as the hurricane bypassed the island. The warm core persisted into October&nbsp;17, which indicated that the hurricane was fully tropical for at least 30&ndash;36&nbsp;hours.<ref name="NOAA"/> Early on October&nbsp;17, the National Hurricane Center discontinued bulletins on the system, while it was located about {{convert|150|mi|km}} northeast of Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0038-jpg/1970/atlantic/td%2337/public/pub170230z.jpg|title=Bulletin|author=[[Neil Frank|Neil L. Frank]]|date=October 17, 1970|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |work=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=May 1, 2013|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> 

At 0600&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;17, the system intensified into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the Saffir<U+2013>Simpson hurricane wind scale. Six hours later, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of {{convert|974|mbar|inHg|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Although a radio bulletin by the [[NSS Annapolis|Naval Communications Station Washington, D.C. Transmitter]] (NSS) at 1200&nbsp;UTC noted that it had hurricane characteristics, the National Hurricane Center did not [[Tropical cyclone naming|name]] the storm. By 1800&nbsp;UTC, a [[cold front]] began impacting the [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] of the hurricane,<ref name="NOAA"/> which caused the storm to weaken back to a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} and began losing its tropical characteristics.<ref name="NOAA"/> At approximately 2330&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;17, the hurricane made landfall on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h). Only 30&nbsp;minutes later, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant extratropical cyclone curved abruptly northward and later re-emerged into the Atlantic, before dissipating on October&nbsp;20.<ref name="EC"/>

==Impact==
Late on October&nbsp;16, the storm passed close to Bermuda as a minimal Category&nbsp;1 hurricane, causing strong winds on the island. Maximum sustained winds of 48&nbsp;mph (77&nbsp;km/h) and gusts up to 58&nbsp;mph (93&nbsp;km/h) were recorded. At an elevated location, an anemometer reported sustained winds as high as 100&nbsp;mph (155&nbsp;km/h). Strong winds caused the suspension of school, transportation, and disruption to businesses across Bermuda. A riot started by the recurrence of vandalism and arson plagued the island for two weeks leading up to the storm. However, merchants and police were forced to ease their anti-riot efforts to board up their windows.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dkwyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b7MFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4890,4170705&hl=en|title=Winds Lash Bermudians|agency=[[United Press International]]|date=October 16, 1970|newspaper=[[The Beaver County Times]]|page=37|accessdate=September 3, 2011|location=Hamilton, Bermuda}}</ref> In addition to high winds, the storm also produced light rainfall on the island of Bermuda, which peaked at {{convert|1.68|in|mm}}.{{Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima}}

Shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, the hurricane moved across the extreme southeastern portion of Newfoundland at Category&nbsp;1 intensity. As a result, high winds were reported across the region; wind speeds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) occurred on the Burin Peninsula. Wind damage occurred throughout the island, although mostly limited to broken windows, trees being uprooted, and fences knocked over.  In addition, a house under construction blew over in [[Marystown]]; another house was abandoned in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] for the fear of the roof blowing off. Hydro poles also caught fire in [[Burin, Newfoundland and Labrador|Burin]] and Grand Banks. Rough seas caused by the storm sunk or damage several fishing dories in Grand Bank and three fishing premises were washed away in [[Lamaline]]. In addition, a fishing ramp was washed out to sea in Lourdes Cove. Damage in the Burin Peninsula alone totaled to thousands of dollars, although the exact figure is unknown.<ref name="EC">{{cite report|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=59D88E49-1|title=1970-NN-2|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=September 3, 2011|publisher=[[Environment Canada]]|work=[[Canadian Hurricane Centre]]|location=Gatineau, Quebec}}</ref>  

Heavy rainfall also occurred across much of the [[Atlantic Canada]] region, especially in areas well west of the path of the storm. The highest amount of precipitation from the storm was reported in Quebec, where rainfall peaked at {{convert|4.9|in|mm}} in the extreme eastern part of the province. Rainfall occurred further north into [[Labrador]], with precipitation of at least {{convert|1|in|mm}} being reported as far north as [[Groswater Bay]]. Further south in the provinces of [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[New Brunswick]], rainfall amounts did not exceed {{convert|4|in|mm}}. No flooding was reported in Atlantic Canada. On the offshore French Territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, severe wind damage was also reported on [[Saint-Pierre, Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint-Pierre]]. Several homes and a church lost its roof.<ref name="EC"/>
