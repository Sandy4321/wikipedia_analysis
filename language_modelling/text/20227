==Reception==
Entertainment Weekly gave the book a "C" grade.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20334740,00.html |title=BOOK REVIEW: The Swan Thieves (2010) |author=Karen Valby |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] date=06 Jan 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref>  The Washington Post said, "Kostova's new book, set partly in Washington, tells a rather simple story, and its characters, although they sometimes insist otherwise, don't change radically over time. (All are painters, and they're not much different, in interest or in outlook, from one another.)"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011103336.html |title=Book World reviews Elizabeth Kostova's 'The Swan Thieves' |author=Donna Rifkind |date=12 Jan 2010 |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref>
