'''Sarah Joy Andrews''' (born 16 December 1981) is a retired female cricketer who played for [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]] from 2006 to early 2010.

After playing in the Second XI in 2000&ndash;01, Andrews made her debut for New South Wales in the 2001&ndash;02 [[Women's National Cricket League]] (WNCL). In her debut season, she was dropped multiple times and not given much of a workload with the ball. She took five wickets and was omitted for the first half of the next season before ending with six wickets despite never bowling a full quota of overs. At the end of the summer, she was selected for the Australian Under-23 team.

In 2003&ndash;04, Andrews played a full season for the first time and took seven wickets. In the second final against Victoria, she bowled a full quota of overs for the first time, in her 21st match. On an Under-23 tour of Sri Lanka, she made her [[first-class cricket|first-class debut]] against the hosts' senior team, taking four wickets. Andrews had a poor 2004&ndash;05 WNCL, taking only five wickets, and the started the following season poorly, taking only three wickets in the first six matches. She took career-best figures of 5/16 and followed it with 3/45 the next day, both against Victoria. She then took 3/32 in the first final against Queensland and ended with five for the finals series as New South Wales won the first of five consecutive titles.

Andrews ended with 16 wickets for the tournament and was rewarded with selection for the national team, making her [[Test cricket|Test]] and [[One Day International]] (ODI) debut at the end of the season against [[India national women's cricket team|India]]. She took 2/48 on her Test debut and 3/21 in her first ODI. After taking ten wickets in her first six ODIs, Andrews took 15 wickets in New South Wales' 2006&ndash;07 WNCL win. She struggled during a quadrangular series on the spin-friendly pitches of India and was used only sporadically, taking three wickets in four matches, but returned to form in the home [[Rose Bowl series|Rose Bowl]] series against New Zealand, taking nine wickets in five matches. In 2007&ndash;08, Andrews was in and out of the Australian team and played in six ODIs, taking seven wickets. She was then dropped for the home series against India at the start of the 2008&ndash;09 season and was responded by taking 13 wickets in the WNCL to earn a recall. Andrews made sporadic appearances in the Rose Bowl series ahead of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup|2009 World Cup]], in which she played in four of Australia's seven matches, taking five wickets as Australia came fourth. She was selected for the [[2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20|2009 World Twenty20]] in England, and played in all of Australia's four matches, taking two wickets. In the subsequent bilateral series hosted by England, Andrews took her career best figures of 4/50 and ended with eight ODI wickets.

Andrews took 14 wickets in the 2009&ndash;10 WNCL as New South Wales won again, and in the following Rose Bowl series, she bowed out of competitive cricket with ten wickets in seven ODIs as Australia swept the series.

== Early career ==

In January 2000, Andrews played for New South Wales in Under-19 interstate championships. She took 11 wickets at 6.00, with a best of 4/13 in the qualifying match against Victoria. New South Wales won all of their seven matches, defeating Victoria in the final. New South Wales' batting was rarely challenged by their outclassed opposition, so Andrews was only required to bat three times in the lower-order, scoring 15 runs at 7.50. She also took six catches.<ref name=o/>

In 2000&ndash;01, Andrews played in three Second XI fixtures for New South Wales. She scored a total of 19 runs in three brief innings that all ended in not outs, and took two wickets at 38.50 and an economy rate of 3.34.<ref name=o>{{cite web| title=Player Oracle SJ Andrews |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=44359&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Meckiff&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

== Domestic debut ==

Andrews made her senior debut for [[New South Wales Breakers|New South Wales]] in the 2001&ndash;02 [[Women's National Cricket League]], playing in seven matches, all of which ended in victory.

She took 0/10 from five overs in her debut against [[South Australian Scorpions|South Australia]], before taking her maiden wickets in the second match of the double-header, claiming 2/7 from three overs. She took only one wicket in the next two matches against Queensland and was dropped for the double-header against Western Australia, before being recalled for the last two round-robin matches against Victoria. She did not bowl in the first, and took 1/17 from six overs in the next. The two teams met again in the finals series, and Andrews was dropped for the first match, before being recalled and taking 1/16 from four overs in the next match as New South Wales won their sixth title in a row with a 2&ndash;0 triumph.<ref name=o/> Andrews ended her first season with five wickets at 16.80 and an economy rate of 3.00.<ref name=o/>

She averaged less than six overs a match.<ref name=o/> At the end of the summer, she played for the Australian Under-23 team against England; she took a total of 0/47 from 19 overs in a two-innings match and scored 21 in Australia's only innings.<ref name=o/>

In 2003&ndash;04, Andrews played her first full season in the WNCL, taking to the field in all 11 of New South Wales' matches. She took only five wickets in the first five matches, including figures of 2/30 from seven overs in a tie against Victoria. She then went wicketless in the last three fixtures of the round-robin stage. In the first final against defending champions Victoria, she took 0/18 from five overs in a six-wicket defeat. She was retained for the second final despite the four consecutive wicketless matches, and took 2/28 from her ten overs to set up a five-wicket win. This was the first time in her 21 WNCL matches that Andrews had bowled a full quota of overs.<ref name=o/> In the deciding final, she was taken out of the attack after being hit for 17 runs in three overs; New South Wales ended up winning by three wickets to regain the WNCL title.

Andrews was selected for the Australia Youth team to play New Zealand A at the end of the season. She took three wickets at 35.00 at an economy rate of 3.00, and hit 54 in a six-wicket defeat in the fourth and final match of the series.<ref name=o/> Before the 2004&ndash;05 season started, Andrews toured [[Sri Lanka]] in September  as part of the Australian Under-23s to play against the hosts' national team. Australia won three of the four one-dayers, the other was washed-out. Andrews took six wickets at 13.00, including 3/44 in the second match, and scored 10 not out and 31 not out in her only innings. The tour ended with a first-class match against the Sri Lankan team. Andrews took 3/24 and 1/11 in a 144-run win. She also made seven and a duck on her first-class debut.<ref name=o/>

She then took 1/10 from six overs but Victoria reached their target with five wickets in hand to square the series. Andrews took 0/11 from six overs to help restrict Victoria to 6/159, but she made only one before being run out as the defending champions fell 50 runs short and ceded their title. Andrews ended the season with 23 runs at 23.00.<ref name=o/>

The 2005&ndash;06 season started poorly for Andrews. She went wicketless in the first three matches, and took only three wickets in the first six matches. Her form turned around in the last two round-robin matches against Victoria. In the first match, having made ten with the bat, she took 5/16, her career best bowling performance, as New South Wales won by 48 runs. The next day, she took 3/45, helping to set up a five-wicket victory.<ref name=o/> New South Wales faced Queensland in the finals.

She had opener [[Monica Sumra]] caught by [[Karen Rolton]] in her second over, and then trapped the other opener [[Karu Jain]] for 21 to leave the Indians at 2/41. In the following over, without further addition to the score, Andrews took her maiden Test catch to dismiss leading Indian batsman and captain [[Mithali Raj]] from the bowling of Fitzpatrick. The Indians eventually collapsed to be all out for 93. Australia enforced the [[follow on]] and Andrews took 0/19 from 17 overs and caught [[Sunetra Paranjpe]] in the second innings as the tourists lost by an innings.<ref name=o/><ref name=t2006/> After missing the first ODI, she made her debut in the second match, coming in at No. 11 and scoring four not out from seven balls in Australia's 173 all out.<ref name=o/><ref name=odi>{{cite web |url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/53631.html?class=9;template=results;type=batting;view=innings |title=Statistics / Statsguru / SJ Andrews / Women's One-Day Internationals |accessdate=2010-04-20 |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> She then took 3/21 from six overs to help secure a 12-run win.

Having broken into international cricket, Andrews started the 2006&ndash;07 WNCL season strongly, taking 3/18 to set up a three-wicket win over Victoria in the opening matches of the season. In the fourth match of the tournament, against Queensland, she made a tail-wagging 16 and took 3/27 from her ten overs, but was not able to defend New South Wales' meagre 9/162 as they lost by six wickets.

After the end of the Australian season, Andrews was selected for the ODI team for a four-nations tournament in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in round-robin phase. On dusty, slow and turning pitches conducive to spin, Andrews was overlooked for the first two matches before playing in four remaining qualifying matches.

In July 2007, Australia hosted New Zealand in a Rose Bowl series in the middle of the southern hemisphere winter by staging the matches in the tropical northern city of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Andrews had another expensive spell in the one-off T20 international, conceding 37 from her four overs while her colleagues averaged 4.37 runs per over.

Andrews was retained for Australia's international engagements against England and New Zealand at the end of the season.

In the solitary T20 match, she scored 10 not out as Australia managed only 9/80 and took 0/15 from four overs in a four-wicket defeat. It was the first time in four T20 internationals that she had conceded less than 6.50 runs per over.<ref name=o/> Andrews played in four of the five ODI matches, taking 3/45 from nine overs in the final match to help set up an eight-wicket win. She ended the series with six wickets at 19.83 and a relatively high economy rate of 4.57 and also scored eight runs at 4.00.<ref name=o/>

== Omission and recall for the 2009 World Cup and World Twenty20 ==
[[Image:Sarah Andrews catch 3.jpg|thumb|Andrews about to take a catch at training.]]
Andrews was dropped from the Australia team for the home series against India before the start of the 2008&ndash;09 WNCL season. She responded by taking 12 wickets in the first six matches of the WNCL season, including a haul of 3/23 in an eight-wicket win over Western Australia and 3/43 in a losing cause against South Australia. In these six matches, she conceded 3.10 runs per over.<ref name=o/> She was unable to maintain this form throughout the season, going wicketless in the final two round-robin matches against Victoria, which New South Wales won to earn hosting rights for the final. Andrews then took 1/11 from seven overs as New South Wales won by six wickets to take a fourth consecutive WNCL title.<ref name=o/> She ended with 13 wickets at 18.53 and an economy rate of 3.23 and made a duck in her only innings.<ref name=o/>

Andrews was also effective in New South Wales's two T20 matches, taking four wickets at 5.75 at and economy rate of 3.28.<ref name=o/>

Andrews' strong WNCL performances earned her a recall into the Australian team ahead of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] to be held in [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. Before the World Cup, the Australians headed to New Zealand for the Rose Bowl series. Andrews was called into the playing XI for the second match, but was ineffective taking 1/52 from ten overs. She was dropped before being recalled for the fourth match, taking 1/17 from four overs in a victory; the final ODI was washed out.<ref name=o/>

In two warm-up matches ahead of the World Cup, Andrews had promising results although she bowled only briefly. She took 1/7 from three overs against England and then took 2/12 from four overs against Sri Lanka, as the hosts won both matches.<ref name=o/>

Despite these results, Andrews was left out of the first two group matches against New Zealand and [[South Africa national women's cricket team|South Africa]]; Australia lost the first and won the latter and needed to win the last group match against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] to ensure progression to the next round. Andrews took 1/34 from eight overs as Australia took a 47-run win. However, she was substantially more expensive than her colleagues&mdash;the run rate in the remaining 42 overs was 3.14&mdash;and was dropped for the first Super Six match against India, which Australia lost by 18 runs.<ref name=o/>  She was recalled and took 1/20 from 7.1 overs against [[Pakistan national women's cricket team|Pakistan]] in a 107-run win. By this time, Australia's two losses had already made it impossible to make the final. Andrews took 3/35 from 8.3 overs in the final super Six match against England, which Australia won by eight wickets, and they met India in the third-place playoff. Andrews batted for the only time in the tournament and was unbeaten on zero as Australia were out for 142. She took 0/23 from five overs as the hosts lost by three wickets.<ref name=o/> Andrews ended the World Cup with five wickets at 22.40 and an economy rate of 3.90.<ref name=o/>
[[Image:Sarah Andrews batting.jpg|thumb|Andrews playing a cut shot at training.]]
Andrews was selected for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three-match series in tropical [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] at the beginning of June before the World Cup, and Andrews showed good form taking five wickets at 11.40 at an economy rate of only 5.70, with a best of 3/13 from three overs in the final match, helping Australia seal the series 2&ndash;1.<ref name=o/> However, she could not maintain the form. She took 0/31 from three overs in the team's only warm-up on English soil, against the hosts, and was retained for all the matches, despite taking only two wickets at 43.50 and taking an economy rate of 7.56. Andrews took 0/25 from three overs in a nine-wicket loss to New Zealand, but was retained for the match against the Wester Indies, taking 2/19 from four overs in a eight-wicket win. She was again attacked in the group match against South Africa, taking 0/19 from two overs in a 24-run win that qualified Australia for the semi-finals. Andrews was retained and was again ineffective, taking 0/24 from 2.3 overs as the hosts won by eight wickets to reach the final, which they won. She did not bat in any of the matches in Australia or England.<ref name=o/>
