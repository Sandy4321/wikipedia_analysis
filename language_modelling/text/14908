{{2012<U+2013>13 Big Ten men's basketball standings}}
The '''2012<U+2013>13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team''' (sometimes '''Team 96''') represented the [[University of Michigan]] during the [[2012<U+2013>13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. For the 46th consecutive year,<ref name="Michigan Facilities: Crisler Center"/> the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball]] team played its home games in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], at the [[Crisler Center]].<ref name="Michigan Facilities: Crisler Center">{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/facilities/crisler-center.html|title=Michigan Facilities: Crisler Center|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> This season marked the team's 96th consecutive year as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The team was led by sixth-year [[head coach]] [[John Beilein]]. As the defending [[2011<U+2013>12 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season]] regular season co-champions, the Wolverines finished fourth in the conference in [[2012<U+2013>13 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|2012<U+2013>13]] and as National Runner-up in the [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The team achieved a 31<U+2013>8 record, the most wins by the program in 20 seasons.

Following the [[2011<U+2013>12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2011-12 season]], the team lost graduating senior captains [[Zack Novak]] and [[Stu Douglass]], who moved on to professional basketball careers in Europe. The incoming class of [[Mitch McGary]], [[Glenn Robinson III]] and [[Nik Stauskas]] was ranked among the best classes in the nation by the media. With its new lineup, the team matched the greatest starts in school history. Starting the season with 11 consecutive wins matched the best start since the last Michigan national champions, the [[1988<U+2013>89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1988<U+2013>89 team]]. At 16<U+2013>0, Michigan matched its best start since the last repeat Big Ten Regular season championship, the [[1985<U+2013>86 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1985<U+2013>86 team]], tying a school record. Reaching 19<U+2013>1 set a record for the best start in school history.  The team also reached the number one position in the [[AP Poll]] for the first time since the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] [[1992<U+2013>93 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1992<U+2013>93 team]]. The team entered February with a 20<U+2013>1 record (7<U+2013>1 Big Ten), but with an injury to eventual B1G All-Defensive selection Jordan Morgan and a stretch of games against its strongest conference opponents, Michigan lost three out of four games. The team closed the season with a 5<U+2013>5 run to finish tied for fourth in the conference and won one game in the [[2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] before being eliminated.

The team was led by 2013 [[List of U.S. men's college basketball national player of the year awards|national player of the year]], [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Ten Player of the Year]] and [[2013 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|2013 Consensus All-American]] [[Trey Burke]] and three additional All-Conference honorees. [[Tim Hardaway, Jr.]] was named to the 2012<U+2013>13 All-Big Ten first team by the coaches and to the second team by the media; Robinson was named an honorable mention All-Big Ten by the media, and Morgan was an All-Big Ten Defensive team selection. Stauskas and McGary earned multiple Big Ten Freshman of the Week recognitions during the season. Burke was the second National Player of the Year and eighth first-team consensus All-American in Michigan basketball history.

Michigan entered the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as the youngest team in the field. The team made its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the [[1993<U+2013>94 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|1993<U+2013>94]] team did so. The Wolverines appeared in the national championship game for the first time since 1989 <U+2013> appearances in 1992 and 1993 were vacated due to a [[University of Michigan basketball scandal|scandal]]. Following the season, at the [[2013 NBA Draft]], Burke and Hardaway were selected ninth and twenty-fourth, respectfully, becoming the first pair of first-round NBA draft choices from Michigan since the [[1994 NBA Draft]].

==Slogans, nicknames and emblems==

===WE ON===
The acronym "WE ON" was the slogan for the whole team for the 2012<U+2013>13 season. The team and coaching staff selected it at the beginning of the season as another way for Michigan to say [[Bo Schembechler|Bo Schembechler's]] famous quote, "the Team, the Team, the Team." The acronym "WE ON" stands for "When Everyone Operates N'sync."<ref name="Michigan">{{cite web|title=Michigan Basketball Game Day Information |author=University of Michigan Athletics|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2012-13/release/release_20130129aaa.pdf|accessdate=2013-09-24|date=2013-01-28|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]}}</ref> Michigan assistant coach [[Bacari Alexander]] even tweeted that the acronym summarizes this team-focussed mindset.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bacari34/status/271952919270658048|title=Status <U+200F>@bacari34 |author=Alexander, Bacari|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=2012-11-30|date=2012-11-23}}</ref> According to [[David Brandon]],  assistant coach LaVall Jordan and director of basketball operations Travis Conlan guided the team to develop the slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/brandon/spec-rel/021113aaa.html|title=Brandon's Blog: WEON More Than an Acronym|accessdate=2013-02-11|date=2013-02-11|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=MGoBlue.com}}</ref>

[[Adidas]] warm up shirts were created and were first worn on November 21, 2012, before Michigan's [[NIT Season Tip-Off]] game against the Pittsburgh Panthers.

Michigan State went on to win the game by 23 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaab-the-dagger/michigan-state-students-don-off-t-shirts-mock-034627204--ncaab.html|title=Michigan State students don 'You Off' T-shirts to mock Michigan<U+2019>s motto|accessdate=2013-02-15|date=2013-02-12|publisher=[[Yahoo! Sports]]|author=Eisenberg, Jeff}}</ref>

'''"WE"''' <U+2013> WE is also an acronym for "Wolverine Excellence", which is chiefly used by the team. Wolverine Excellence calls for players and managers to focus on its five core values: integrity, unity, passion, diligence and appreciation.<ref name="Michigan" />

'''"ON"''' <U+2013> ON represented each player's individual commitment to season-long improvement. There was a "U-M Fuse Box" (mock-University of Michigan set of switches) in the Men's Basketball locker room in Crisler Center. Each player had selected one word on which to focus during the season and before every practice and game, each player flipped their switch "on." This represented each player's commitment to improvement every day.<ref name="Michigan" /><ref name="Rothstein" />

===Fresh Five===
Prior to the season, the five freshman were dubbed the "Fresh Five", a moniker hearkening remembrance of the incoming freshman class of 1991, known as the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]], that led Michigan to back-to-back Championship games while starting the majority of games. However, the nickname and its expectations were downplayed most of the season by the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121011/COL38/310110265/Jeff-Seidel-Wolverines-try-to-deal-with-high-expectations|title=Jeff Seidel: Michigan basketball tries to deal with high expectations|accessdate=2013-20-26|date=2012-10-11|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|author=Seidel, Jeff}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2012/10/story.php?id=8482#.UkEp6izqOl8|title=Hoops Preview: Meet Basketball's Fresh Five|accessdate=2013-20-26|date=2012-10-23|work=[[Michigan Today]]|author=Stapleton, Joe}}</ref> Nonetheless, during the final two weeks of the regular season ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a feature story on the team that reinvigorated the nickname while noting that the current five were the supporting cast rather than the stars of the team like the original five.<ref name=AFFPMITTP/>
