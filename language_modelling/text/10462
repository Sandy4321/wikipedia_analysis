Developed in the 17th century during [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal rule]] in [[Bengal]], when Old Dhaka was the provincial capital and a centre of the flourishing [[muslin]] industry, the neighborhood was originally named ''Bagh-e-[[Badshah]]i'' ([[Persian language|Farsi]]: ''Garden of the Master Kings''), but later came to be called by the shortened name ''[[Shah]]'' (Farsi:<U+0634><U+0627><U+0647>, king) ''[[Persian Gardens|Bagh]]'' (Farsi: <U+0628><U+0627><U+063A>, garden).<ref>{{cite web

Shahbag is home to the nation's leading educational and public institutions, including the [[University of Dhaka]], the oldest and largest public university in Bangladesh, and the [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology]], the largest public university for technological studies in the country.  Shahbag hosts many [[street market]]s and [[bazaars]], and since the emergence of Bangladesh as an [[History of Bangladesh|independent country]] in 1971, the Shahbag area has become a venue for celebrating major [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|festivals]], such as the [[Bengali New Year]] and [[Basant|Basanta Utsab]].

Shahbag's numerous ponds, palaces and gardens have inspired the work of writers, singers, and poets.  The ''Thana'' area, with Dhaka University at its centre, has seen the debut of some of the major political movements in the nation's history, including the [[All India Muslim Education Conference]] in 1905, which in turn spawned the [[All India Muslim League]] and led, in 1947, to both the [[partition of India]] and the creation of [[Pakistan]]; the [[Language Movement]] in 1952, which led to the recognition of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as an official language of Pakistan; and the [[Six point movement]] in 1966, which led to the nation's independence.  It was here, on [[March 7]], [[1971]], that [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] delivered a historic speech calling for the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan, and here too, later that year, that the [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani Army]] surrendered in the [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]]. The area has since become a staging ground for protests by students and other groups.<ref>{{cite news |first= Mubin S.|last=Khan |title=Eight days that shook the campus |url=http://www.weeklyholiday.net/020802/last.html |work=Weekly Holiday, Bangladesh|date= August 2, 2002|accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=DU students on rampage: Student injured in road accident|url=http://independent-bangladesh.com/news/may/10/10052006mt.htm |work=The Independent, Bangladesh |date=May 10, 2006|accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Environmentalists for steps to limit green house gas, global warming|url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/nov/12/met.html |work=The New Age, Bangladesh |publisher= |date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref>

Although urban settlements in the Dhaka area date back to the [[7th century]] [[Common Era|CE]],<ref>Jatindramohan Rai quotes ''Rajtarangini'' by Kalhan in ''Dhakar Itihas'', 1913</ref> the earliest evidence of [[urbanization|urban construction]] in the ''Shahbag'' area is to be found at monuments constructed after 1610, when the Mughals turned Dhaka into a provincial capital and established the gardens of Shahbag.  Among these monuments are: the ''Dhaka Gate'', located near the [[Bangla Academy]] in Shahbag, and erected by [[Mir Jumla]], the Mughal [[subadar]] of Bengal from 1660 to 1663;<ref>{{cite news

However, with the decline of Mughal power in Bengal, the Shahbag gardens&mdash;''the Gardens of the Kings''&mdash;fell into neglect. In 1704, when the provincial capital was moved to [[Murshidabad]], they became the property of the Naib Nazims&mdash;the Deputy-Governors of the sub-province of [[East Bengal]]&mdash;and the representatives of the Nawabs of [[Murshidabad]].  Although British power was established in Dacca in 1757, the upkeep of Shahbag gardens was resumed only in the early [[19th century]] under the patronage of an [[East India Company]] judge, Griffith Cook,<ref>{{cite book

Upon his death, in 1868, the estate passed to his grandson [[Khwaja Ahsanullah|Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah]]. In the early 20th century, Ahsanullah's son, [[Khwaja Salimullah|Sir Nawab Khwaja Salimullah]], was able to reclaim some of the lost splendour of the gardens by dividing them into two smaller gardens&mdash;the present-day ''Shahbag'' and ''Paribag'' (or, "garden of fairies")&mdash;the latter named after Paribanu, one of Ahsanullah's daughters.<ref name="paribag">{{cite web

With the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal]] in 1905, and with [[Dhaka|Dacca]] becoming the capital of the new province of [[East Bengal]], European-style houses were rapidly built in the area, especially along the newly-constructed Fuller Road (named after Sir Bampfylde Fuller, the first [[Lieutenant Governor]] of East Bengal).  Around this time, the first zoo in the Dhaka area was also opened in Shahbag.<ref>{{cite web

==Historic Mansions==
{{seealso|Dhaka Nawab Family}}
[[Image:Water-tower-shahbagh1904.jpg|thumb|Water tower in Shahbagh gardens, 1904]]
Also located in Shahbag are several mansions built by [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] in the 19th century.  These mansions not only figured prominently in the history of Dhaka, but also gained mention in the histories of both [[Bengal]] and [[British India]].

A well-known Nawab family mansion is the '''Ishrat Manzil'''.  Originally, a dance-hall for the performances of ''Baijees'', or dancing women, (including, among the famous ones, Piyari Bai, Heera Bai, Wamu Bai and Abedi Bai), the mansion became the venue for the [[All India Muslim Education Conference|All-India Muslim Education Society Conference]] in [[1906]], which was attended by 4,000 participants.  In [[1912]], Society convened here again under the leadership of [[Khwaja Salimullah|Nawab Salimullah]], and met with [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]], the [[Viceroy of India]]. The ''Ishrat Manzil'' was subsequently rebuilt as Hotel Shahbag (designed by British architects Edward Hicks and Ronald McConnel), the first major international hotel in Dhaka. In 1965, the building was acquired by the Institute of Post-graduate Medicine and Research (IPGMR), and later, in 1998, by the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU).<ref name="shahbag">{{cite web

[[Image:Shahbagh-garden1904.jpg|thumb|The Jalsaghar in early 20th century]]

Another Nawab mansion is the '''Jalsaghar'''.  Built as a skating rink and a ballroom for the Nawabs, it was later converted into an eatery and meeting place for students and faculty of Dhaka University and renamed ''Modhur Canteen''.  In the late 1960s, ''Modhur Canteen'' became a focal point for planning student protests against the West Pakistan regime.  Flanked on one side by the Arts Faculty of Dhaka University and on the other by the [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka|IBA]] (Institute of Business Administration), the ''Modhur Canteen'' remains a powerful political symbol.<ref name="shahbag">{{cite web

'''Nishat Manjil''' was built as the princely stable and clubhouse for the Nawabs, and served as a venue of receptions for the statesmen of the day, including [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] (Viceroy of India),  [[Thomas Gibson-Carmichael, 1st Baron Carmichael|Lord Carmichael]] ([[Governor of Bengal]]), Sir Steuart Bayley (Lt. Governor of Bengal), Sir [[Charles Elliott]] (Lt. Governor of Bengal), and John Woodburn (Lt. Governor of Bengal). 

The Nawab's '''Paribag House''' was built by Khwaja Salimullah in the memory of his sister, Pari Banu.  Later, with the downturn in the family's fortunes, his son, Nawab Khwaja Habibullah, lived here for many years. The ''hammam'' (bath) and the ''hawakhana'' (green house) were regarded as marvels of design in early 20th century.<ref name="paribag">{{cite web

Shahbag was at the centre of the cultural and political activities associated with the [[Language movement]] of 1952, which resulted in the founding here of the [[Bangla Academy]], a national academy for promoting the [[Bengali language]].   The first formal art school in Dhaka<U+2014>the [[Art Institute Dhaka|Dhaka Art College]] (now Institute of Fine Arts)<U+2014>was founded in Shahbag by [[Zainul Abedin]] in 1948.  Later, [[Mazharul Islam]], the pioneer of modern architecture in Bangladesh, designed the Art College as one of his early projects.  In the 1970s, [[Jiraz Art Gallery]] opened as the first commercial art wing in the Shahbag area.  Other cultural landmarks in the area include
the [[Bangladesh National Museum]],<ref>{{cite web

The Shahbag area has a rich religious history.  In the late 1920s, [[Sri Anandamoyi Ma]], the noted [[Hindu]] ascetic, also known as the ''Mother of Shahbag'', built her [[ashram]] near [[Ramna Kali Mandir]], or the Temple of [[Kali]], at Ramna.  Her presence in Dhaka owed directly to Shahbag, for her husband, Ramani Mohan Chakrabarti, had accepted the position of caretaker of Shahbag gardens a few years earlier.  In 1971 the Temple of Kali was destroyed by the Pakistani Army in the Liberation War of Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite news

Since 1875, the Shahbag gardens have hosted a famous [[fair]] celebrating the [[New Year's Day|Gregorian New Year]] and containing exhibits of agricultural and industrial items, as well as those of animals and birds.  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the gardens were the private property of the Nawab of Dhaka, and, although a portion of the gardens had been donated to Dhaka University in 1918, ordinary citizens could enter the main gardens only during the fair.  In 1921, at the request of the Nawab's daughter, Paribanu, the organisers of the fair set aside one day during which only women were admitted to the fair, a tradition that has continued down to the present.  Today, the fair features dance recitals by girls, ''[[Jatra (Bangladesh)|Jatra]]'' (a native form of folk theater), ''putul naach'' (puppet shows), magic shows and [[Bioscope show]]s.<ref name="shahbag">{{cite web

The ''[[Basant|Basanta Utsab]]'' (Festival of Spring) takes place every [[February 14]] <U+2014> the first day of spring, according to the reformed [[Bengali calendar#The Revised Bengali Calendar|Bangladeshi Calendar]].
