'''Batgirl''' is the name of several [[fictional characters]] appearing in [[comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]], depicted as female counterparts to the superhero [[Batman]]. Although the character [[Bette Kane|Betty Kane]] was introduced into publication in 1961 by [[Bill Finger]] and [[Sheldon Moldoff]] as '''Bat-Girl''', she is replaced by [[Barbara Gordon]] in 1967, who later came to be identified as the first Batgirl. Her creation came about as a joint project between DC Comics editor [[Julius Schwartz]] and the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series. In order to boost ratings for the third season of ''Batman'', the producers requested a new female character be introduced into publication that could be adapted into the television series. At Schwartz's direction, Barbara Gordon debuted in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359 titled, "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!" (1967) by writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artist [[Carmine Infantino]]. Depicted as the daughter of [[Gotham City]] police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], her civilian identity is given a doctorate in library science and she is employed as head of Gotham City Public Library, as well as later being elected to the [[United States Congress]]. As Batgirl, the character operates primarily in Gotham City, allying herself with Batman and the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] [[Dick Grayson]], as well as other prominent heroes in the [[DC Universe]].

While the introduction of Batgirl into the ''Batman'' television series failed to save it from cancellation, her comic book counterpart gained popularity and makes regular appearances in ''Detective Comics'', ''[[Batman Family]]'' and several other books produced by DC until 1988. That year, she appears in [[Barbara Kesel]]'s ''Batgirl Special'' #1, in which she retires from crime-fighting. She subsequently appears in [[Alan Moore]]'s graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' where, in her civilian identity, she is shot through the spinal cord by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and left [[paraplegia|paraplegic]]. Although she is recreated as the computer expert and information broker Oracle by editor [[Kim Yale]] and writer [[John Ostrander]] the following year, her paralysis sparked debate about the [[portrayal of women in comics]], particularly violence depicted toward female characters. Despite her paralysis in mainstream continuity, [[alternative versions of Barbara Gordon]] in her Batgirl persona have continued to appear in non-canon storylines produced by DC, typically under the company's imprint labels, [[Elseworlds]] and [[All Star DC Comics]].

In the 1999 crossover ''[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]'', the character [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], known as [[Huntress (comics)|Huntress]], briefly assumes the role of Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman for violating his stringent codes. Within the same storyline, writer [[Kelley Puckett]] and artist [[Damion Scott (comics)|Damion Scott]] introduce the character [[Cassandra Cain]], who takes the mantle of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. Written as the daughter of assassins [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]] and [[Lady Shiva]], she is trained from early childhood to read human body language instead of developing verbal and written communication skills as part of her father's conditioning to mold her into the world's deadliest assassin. However, after committing her first murder, she vows to never again use her martial arts prowess to kill. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series as well as one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was canceled in 2006, at which point during the company-wide event [[One Year Later]], she is established as a villain and head of the [[League of Assassins]]. After receiving harsh feedback from readership, she is later restored to her original conception. However, the character [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]], originally known as Spoiler and later Robin, succeeds her as Batgirl after Cassandra Cain abandons the role. 

Stephanie Brown became the featured character of the ''Batgirl'' series written by [[Bryan Q. Miller]] from 2009 to 2011. DC subsequently relaunched all their monthly publications during [[The New 52]] event. In the revised continuity, Barbara Gordon recovers from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and stars in the relaunched ''Batgirl'' series written by [[Gail Simone]] as the title character. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has been adapted into various media relating to the [[Batman franchise media|Batman franchise]], including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. This factored into the decision to return her to the comic book role, as [[Dan DiDio]], Co-Publisher of DC Comics, expressed that she is the best known version of the character. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in both ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'s'' "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" and [[IGN]]'s "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes".<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer's Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 20| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref><ref name="Top 100 Comic Book Heroes">{{citation | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17 | title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref>

''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity.

The first ''Batgirl'' monthly comic was published in 2000, with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Raised by assassin [[David Cain (comics)|David Cain]], Cassandra Cain was not taught spoken language, but instead was taught to "read" physical movement. Subsequently, Cain's only form of communication was body language.<ref name="Nature or Nurture?">{{cite web | last=Richards | first=Dave | title=Nature or Nurture?

This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her abilities to read and write.

When DC Comics continuity skipped forward [[One Year Later|one year]] after the events of the limited series ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Cassandra Cain is revived as leader of the [[League of Assassins]], having abandoned her previous characterization as an [[altruist]].

===The New 52: ''Batgirl'', ''Birds of Prey'' and other appearances (2011-present)===
In September, 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new ''Batgirl'' series<U+2014>one of [[The New 52]] titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to an earlier age and stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting back to issue #1, "our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach<U+2014>not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters."<ref name="New 52">{{citation|author=Michael Doran|title=DC Releases New "The New 52" Info & Answers to Retailers|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/dcnu-the-new-52-retailer-info-110701.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=2011-07-01|accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> Wayne also stated that "''The Killing Joke'' still happened and she was Oracle.

===Alternative versions===
{{Main|Alternative versions of Barbara Gordon}}

Various alterations of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as ''[[Elseworlds]]'' and ''[[All Star DC Comics]]'' have also featured alternate versions of the character. The ''Elseworlds'' imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes "as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow."<ref>{{citation|author=M.

In 2005, DC Comics launched its ''All Star'' imprint<U+2014>an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to ''Elseworlds'', ''All Star'' is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership.

==Cultural impact==
While Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain have both been the subject of academic analysis regarding the [[portrayal of women in comics]], commentary on Barbara Gordon's Batgirl has focused on her character's connection to the [[Women's liberation movement]], doctoral degree and career as a librarian, while analysis of Cassandra Cain's Batgirl has focused on the character's double minority status as a woman and a [[person of color]].

===Feminist interpretations===
{{quote box|quote=In the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the feminist revolution, Schwartz's leading ladies included a reporter (Iris West in The Flash), a lawyer (Jean Loring in The Atom), and even the head of an aircraft company (Carol Ferris in Green Lantern). Shiera Hall was merely a secretary at the Midway City Museum, but as Hawkgirl she was a police officer on her native planet Thanagar and an equal partner to her husband Hawkman (Carter Hall) in their superheroic exploits. Then there was Zatanna, bravely traversing the dimensions in her search for her missing father (as chronicled in the recent DC trade paperback Zatanna's Quest). Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian, but her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her "civilian identity" and ran for Congress.)|source=<U+2014>[[Peter Sanderson]], [[IGN]], 2005<ref name="Sanderson 2007">{{citation|author=[[Peter Sanderson]] | title = Comics in Context #67: Catch As Cats Can | year = 2007 | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595646p7.html |publisher=IGN|date=2005-01-07| accessdate = 2007-11-22}}</ref>|width=350px}}

===Representation for library and information science===
In ''The Image and Role of the Librarian'' (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that Batgirl's portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career.

The Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, depicted as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable as one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists, and as a result, are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, "Cassandra's racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent."<ref name="curves"/> The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayls of women, and Asian women in particular.<ref name="curves"/> The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8704 | title=Adam Beechen Forms A Dynamic Duo With 'Robin' | last=Singh | first=Arune | work=Comic Book Resources | date=October 24, 2006 | accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref> When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer."<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=8802 | title=Reflections: Talking 'Robin' (and Batgirl) with Adam Beechen | last=Taylor | first=Robert | work=Comic Book Resources | date=November 5, 2006 | accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref> Although Cain is eventually restored as a hero, Jeffrey A.

Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of ''Batman'' (1967). Les Daniels, in ''Batman: The Complete History'' (2004) wrote that the goal of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was to "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men."<ref name="Daniels">{{citation |author = [[Les Daniels]] | title = Batman: The Complete History | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 2004 | location = | pages = 113, 115 |isbn = 0-8118-4232-0 }}</ref> According to Craig: "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle&nbsp;... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice."<ref name="Daniels"/> A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television at the time (such as Wonder Woman and the [[The Bionic Woman|Bionic Woman]]), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen.<ref name="Overviews"/> As such, "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use."<ref name="Overviews"/> However, Craig has also stated: "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model&nbsp;... They say its because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that<U+2019>s lovely."<ref>{{citation |author=Ashley McAllister | title = From the Library: Batgirl! | url = http://bitchmagazine.org/post/from-the-library-batgirl |publisher=Bitch Media| date = 2010-08-15|accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref> During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate [[equal pay for women]].<ref name="Girl Culture">{{citation|author=Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh|title=Girl Culture: Studying Girl Culture : A Readers' Guide|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2008|page=170|isbn=978-0-313-33908-0}}</ref>
