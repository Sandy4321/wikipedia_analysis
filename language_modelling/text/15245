{{nihongo|'''Jiraiya'''|<U+81EA><U+6765><U+4E5F>}} is a fictional character in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Naruto]]''.

His name literally means "coming on one's own", which pretty much describes his personality; quietly appearing and disappearing from Konoha at any time. It may also be a reference to his perverse hobbies. 

The names of Jiraiya, [[Tsunade (Naruto)|Tsunade]] and [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]] come from the old story [[Jiraiya|Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari]] (<U+5150><U+96F7><U+4E5F><U+8C6A><U+5091><U+7269><U+8A9E>, "The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya") from Japanese literature. The Jiraiya in this story excelled in summoning a giant toad (the toad itself was sometimes called "Jiraiya") and toad magic. In that story, Jiraiya and Tsunade were a married couple. There, his name is written as "<U+5150><U+96F7><U+4E5F>" meaning "Young Thunder" which in turn comes from the name Garaiya (<U+6211><U+6765><U+4E5F>, "I came") from the [[Chinese literature|Chinese]] story Kaishi (<U+8AE7><U+53F2>).

Jiraiya is a former student of the [[Third Hokage]]. Jiraiya and his former teammates, Orochimaru and Tsunade, are known as the {{nihongo|"Legendary Three Ninja"|<U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+306E><U+4E09><U+5FCD>|Densetsu no Sannin}} or simply the "Sannin", while Jiraiya himself is known as the {{nihongo|"Toad Hermit"|<U+8766><U+87C7><U+4ED9><U+4EBA>|Gama Sennin}}. Later in his life, Jiraiya became the [[Naruto ninja ranks#Jonin|Jonin]] sensei of the future [[Land of Fire#Hokage, Fourth|Fourth Hokage]] and two other, as yet unknown, Genin. Jiraiya's favorite foods are garlic root and fried chicken, with his least favorite being kiwi and gratin. His favorite phrase is "free-spirited".

As a child, Jiraiya developed a close relationship with Orochimaru. When Orochimaru would years later betray Konoha and flee the village, Jiraiya pursued him, trying to convince his friend to come back. Orochimaru refused and attacked Jiraiya, and turned his back to Konoha forever. After asking himself why Orochimaru had defected and eventually determining that he wasn't coming back, Jiraiya too left Konoha so that he could follow Orochimaru's movements, and in time came to follow the organization that Orochimaru joined: [[Akatsuki (Naruto)|Akatsuki]].

Although he was fairly clumsy when he was younger, Jiraiya is a genius [[Naruto ninja ranks#S-Class|S-Class]] ninja who specializes in summoning [[List of Naruto summons#Gama family|toads]] and using ninjutsu. The kanji on Jiraiya's forehead protector (<U+6CB9>, Abura) means "oil", which probably has to do with the use of toad oil for medicine and his flame-oil attack with [[List of Naruto summons#Gamabunta|Gamabunta]]. Jiraiya's abilities are apparently exceptional in the ''Naruto'' universe, as Akatsuki members [[Akatsuki (Naruto)#Itachi Uchiha|Itachi Uchiha]] and [[Akatsuki (Naruto)#Kisame Hoshigaki|Kisame Hoshigaki]] felt that they couldn't defeat Jiraiya without dying themselves.

Jiraiya is a self-proclaimed super-[[pervert]] and a frequent voyeur, going so far as to create the [[List of ninjutsu in Naruto (S-Z)#Transparent Escape Technique|Transparent Escape Technique]] so that he wouldn't get caught spying on naked women (or "data-gathering" as he calls it). He never actually hides his perversion, and even seems proud of it, as seen when he told the Third Hokage about it when he was still a child. Despite this, Jiraiya doesn't like being called {{nihongo|''Ero-sennin''|<U+30A8><U+30ED><U+4ED9><U+4EBA>||''literally'' Perverted hermit or Erotic hermit; Pervy sage in the U.S. dub}} by [[Naruto Uzumaki]] in front of others. He has been caught peeping at least once when he was younger by Tsunade who, in her anger, beat Jiraiya to within an inch of his life, breaking both his arms, six of his ribs, and rupturing a number of organs.

Some time after leaving Konoha, Jiraiya became an author of adult novels, his most popular work being {{nihongo|Make Out Paradise|<U+30A4><U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30A4><U+30C1><U+30E3><U+30D1><U+30E9><U+30C0><U+30A4><U+30B9>|Icha Icha Paradaisu}}. In a filler episode of the anime, Naruto [[Ghostwriter|ghostwrites]] one of Jiraiya's ''Icha Icha'' novels and the book is found to be very popular, meaning that Naruto is capable of writing on the same level as Jiraiya, or that Jiraiya's writing abilities are no better than that of a child. The popularity of the ''Icha Icha'' series seems to have paid off well, as Jiraiya's checkbook reveals that he is fairly wealthy (Naruto exclaims that there are quite a few zeros at the end). Despite his wealth, Jiraiya is not above taking Naruto's money and spending it on sake and women.

== Part I ==
=== Chunin Exam arc ===
During Naruto's chakra training with [[List of Konoha Jonin#Ebisu|Ebisu]] in a bathhouse, Ebisu finds Jiraiya to be spying on women. When Ebisu tries to reprimand Jiraiya, Jiraiya summons a toad to instantly defeat Ebisu. No longer having someone to help him train, Naruto demands that Jiraiya become Ebisu's replacement. Although reluctant at first, Naruto's persistence and his [[List of ninjutsu in Naruto (S-Z)#Sexy Technique|Sexy Technique]] finally persuades Jiraiya to agree.

During their training, Jiraiya discovers that Orochimaru had sealed Naruto's [[Tailed beasts#Nine-Tailed Demon Fox|Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]] chakra, making it difficult for Naruto to perform jutsu. After removing the seal, Jiraiya starts to train Naruto to use the demon fox's power at will by teaching him the [[List of ninjutsu in Naruto (S-Z)#Summoning Technique|Summoning Technique]], the former being required for the latter to be effective. Later, during the invasion of Konoha, Jiraiya joins the fight in repelling the invading forces.

=== Search for Tsunade arc ===
After the death of the Third Hokage, the village elders ask Jiraiya to take up the title of the [[Naruto ninja ranks#Kage|Fifth Hokage]]. Jiraiya declines, and instead promises to search for Tsunade, who he thinks would do a better job as Hokage. Jiraiya brings Naruto with him, needing the help but also wanting to protect Naruto from Akatsuki who want the demon fox sealed within him. As they search for Tsunade, Jiraiya teaches Naruto the [[List of ninjutsu in Naruto (S-Z)#Spiraling Sphere|Spiraling Sphere]], which Naruto is able to learn very rapidly via a number of shortcuts.

Once they eventually find Tsunade, Jiraiya tries to convince her to assume the role of Hokage. Not fond of the offer or Jiraiya's persistence, Tsunade drugs Jiraiya, making it difficult for him to move and use chakra. During Tsunade's later fight with Orochimaru, Jiraiya finds his drugged state to be very debilitating in assisting Tsunade, as it halves the potency of his techniques several times over. After finally forcing Orochimaru to flee, largely due to Tsunade's efforts, Tsunade accepts the position of Hokage.

=== Sasuke Retrieval arc ===
After Naruto's failed attempt to stop [[Sasuke Uchiha]] from abandoning Konoha, Jiraiya tries to convince Naruto to forget about Sasuke, remembering his own experiences with Orochimaru and not wanting Naruto to go through the same thing. Naruto retorts that he'd be happier wasting his time if it means that Sasuke might come back to konoha. Touched, Jiraiya offers to take Naruto away for three years of training so that he can get stronger. Naruto accepts, and Jiraiya says that they'll set out when Naruto is ready.

== Anime filler arcs ==
During the course of the filler arcs, Jiraiya gathers information on Akatsuki, occasionally offering assistance with missions. The filler arcs also shed some light on Jiraiya's early years, showing that he often bickered with Orochimaru and Tsunade as children, and that he was responsible for turning the tide of a war in Konoha's favor, which also resulted in the annihilation of a rival village. Eventually, once deciding that Naruto is ready, Jiraiya leaves with Naruto to begin their training.

== Part II ==
Over the course of the timeskip, Jiraiya teaches Naruto how to more readily access the demon fox's chakra. In doing so, Jiraiya is for a second time in his life brought to the brink of death, with Naruto in his four-tailed demon fox form being too much for Jiraiya to handle. Upon returning Naruto to Konoha, Jiraiya disappears so that he can research Akatsuki's whereabouts and motives.
