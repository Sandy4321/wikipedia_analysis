Since the 1950s, Armenians from the Middle Eastern nations of [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Armenians in Iran|Iran]] and [[Armenians in Lebanon|Lebanon]] have migrated to America as a result of instability in those countries, and since the late 1980s, immigrants from [[Soviet Armenia]] could be found as well. Since the independence of [[Armenia]] from the Soviet Union in 1991 and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|following war]] with neighboring [[Azerbaijan]], additional Armenians fled to the US.

The Armenian American community is the most politically influential community of the [[Armenian diaspora]].<ref name="Von Voss"/> Organizations such as [[Armenian National Committee of America]] and [[Armenian Assembly of America]] advocate for the [[recognition of the Armenian Genocide]] by the US government and support stronger [[Armenia<U+2013>United States relations]].  The [[Armenian General Benevolent Union|Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU)]] is known for its financial support and promotion of Armenian cultural and [[List of Armenian schools in the United States|Armenian language schools]]. The [[Armenian language]] (both the [[Eastern Armenian|Eastern]] and mainly the [[Western Armenian|Western]] dialects) is spoken in the US, especially in California, where most recent Armenian immigrants and established Armenian communities have settled. The majority of Armenians are followers of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the oldest national church in the world, and Armenian Americans are no exception. 

The 2011 [[American Community Survey]] estimated that 483,366 Americans held full or partial Armenian ancestry.<ref name="American Community Survey">{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://ia601608.us.archive.org/26/items/2011AmericanCommunitySurveyAncestry/2011Acs.pdf|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref> Various organizations and media criticize these numbers as an underestimate, proposing 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenian Americans instead. The highest concentration of Americans of Armenian descent is in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], where 166,498 people have identified themselves as Armenian to the [[United States 2000 Census|2000 Census]], comprising over 40% of the 385,488 people who identified Armenian origins in the US at the time. [[Glendale, California]], a suburb of Los Angeles, is widely thought to be the center of Armenian American life.

==History==

===Early history ===
The first Armenians came to [[North America]] in the early 17th century. The first recorded Armenian in North America was Martin the Armenian, an [[Iran]]ian tobacco grower who settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1618.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=33}}<ref name="Papazian"/> In 1653 and 1654, two Armenians from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] were invited to [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] to raise [[Bombyx mori|silk worms]].{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=33}}<ref name="Papazian"/> A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but most came as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=33}} The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in 1830s from [[Cilicia]] and [[Western Armenia]]. [[Khachig Oskanian]], a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1834 to pursue higher education.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=33}} He later worked for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and became the [[New York Press Club]] president.<ref name="encyclopedia of ny"/> Many Armenians followed him and came to the US for education.<ref name="Armenian Printing">{{cite news|last=Matiossian|first=Vartan|title=Teotig: The First Historian of Armenian Printing|url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2012/08/31/teotig/|newspaper=[[The Armenian Weekly]]|accessdate=26 November 2012|date=31 August 2012}}</ref>

A number of Armenians were known to have served in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Three Armenian doctors&mdash;Simeon Minasian, Garabed Galstian, and Baronig Matevosian&mdash;worked at military hospitals in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name="Nersisyan">{{cite journal|last=Nersisyan|first=Mkrtich|title=<U+0554><U+0561><U+0572><U+0561><U+0584><U+0561><U+056F><U+0561><U+0576> <U+057A><U+0561><U+057F><U+0565><U+0580><U+0561><U+0566><U+0574><U+0568> <U+0531><U+0574><U+0565><U+0580><U+056B><U+056F><U+0561><U+0575><U+0578><U+0582><U+0574> <U+0570><U+0561><U+0575> <U+057A><U+0561><U+0580><U+0562><U+0565><U+0580><U+0561><U+056F><U+0561><U+0576> <U+0574><U+0561><U+0574><U+0578><U+0582><U+056C><U+056B> <U+056C><U+0578><U+0582><U+057D><U+0561><U+0562><U+0561><U+0576><U+0578><U+0582><U+0569><U+0575><U+0561><U+0574><U+0562>|journal=''[[Patma-Banasirakan Handes]]''|year=1961|volume=<U+2116> 2 (13)|pages=47<U+2013>66|trans_title=The American Civil War as Elucidated in the Armenian Periodical Press|publisher=[[Armenian National Academy of Sciences]]|language=Armenian}}</ref> The only Armenian known to have participated in hostilities was [[Khachadour Paul Garabedian]], who enlisted in the [[Union Navy]]. A naturalized citizen from [[Rodosto]], Garabedian served aboard the blockade ships ''[[USS Geranium (1863)|USS Geranium]]'' and ''[[USS Grand Gulf (1863)|USS Grand Gulf]]'' as a Third Assistant Engineer (and was later made an officer) from 1864 until his [[honorable discharge]] from the Navy in August 1865.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boltz|first=Martha M.|title=The Civil War's only Armenian soldier to be honored|url=http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/civil-war/2011/sep/20/civil-wars-only-armenian-soldier-be-honored/|publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]''|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=20 September 2011}}</ref> 

In 1854, there were 20 Armenians in the United States, and by the 1870s their number reached 70.{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=59}} In the late 1870s, small Armenian communities existed in [[New York City]]; [[Providence, Rhode Island]]; and [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. By the late 1880s, the number of Armenians in the US reached 1,500. Many of them were young male students of the American Evangelical Missions spread throughout the Ottoman Empire. About 40% came from the [[Vilayet of Mamuret-ul-Aziz|Province of Kharpert]].{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=33}} Before 1899, immigrants were not classified by ethnicity, but rather by country of birth, obscuring the ethnic origins of many Armenians.{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=63}} After 1869, however, Armenians from the eastern regions of the Ottoman Empire were registered as "Armenian" in American records. The number of Armenians that migrated to the US from 1820 to 1898 is estimated to be around 4,000.{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=34}}

===First wave of immigration and the Interwar period===
Armenians began to arrive in the US in higher numbers than before in the late nineteenth century, most notably after the [[Hamidian Massacres]] of 1894<U+2013>1896, and before, during and after the [[Armenian Genocide]].{{sfn|Hovannisian|1997|p=390}} Before this mass migration to the US, the number of Armenians in the country was from 1,500 to 3,000, and mostly consisted of laborers.{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=71}}{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=13}}{{sfn|Avakian|1977|p=40}}

Over 12,000 Armenians from the Ottoman Empire came to the US throughout the 1890s.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=9}} With the exception of [[Fresno, California]], which had land suitable for farming, the earliest Armenian immigrants mostly settled in the northeastern industrial centers: New York City, Providence, Worcester, and [[Boston]].{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=13}} Armenian emigrants from the [[Russian Empire]] were only a minority in emigration from Armenian lands across the Atlantic (about 2,500 came in 1898<U+2013>1914), because Armenians were treated relatively better in Russia than in the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=10}} Once in America, some Armenians organized [[political parties]] to serve various causes in America and in the homeland.<ref name="Armenian Printing"/> Turkish Armenian migration rose gradually in the first decade of the 20th century, as a result of the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908, the [[Adana Massacre|Adana Massacre of 1909]], and the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912<U+2013>1913.{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=35}} Before the start of the [[World War I]], there were already 60,000 Armenians in the US.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=10}} As more Armenians fell victim to the genocide and more Armenians were deported, the Armenian American community grew gradually.

According to the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], 54,057 Armenians entered the US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed countries of origin were [[Turkey]] (46,474), [[Russia]] (3,034), [[Canada]] (1,577), [[Great Britain]] (914) and [[Egypt]] (894). During this era, immigrants were asked to indicate which state that they were going to settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were [[New York]] (17,391), [[Massachusetts]] (14,192), [[Rhode Island]] (4,923), [[Illinois]] (3,313), [[California]] (2,564), [[New Jersey]] (2,115), [[Pennsylvania]] (2,002), [[Michigan]] (1,371).{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=67}} The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City, [[Fresno]], Worcester, Boston, Philadelphia, [[Chicago]], [[Jersey City]], [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], and [[Cleveland]].{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=73}}

According to estimates, about 77,980 Armenians lived in the US in 1919.{{sfn|Malcom|1919|p=67}} An unprecedented number of Armenians entered the country in 1920,{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=10}} but the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US.<ref name="Papazian"/> Most of the post-World War I immigrants were women and children, in contrast to the prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=10}} Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as ''campanilismo'', Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. It almost disappeared after [[World War II]].{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=184-185}}

[[Anti-Armenianism]] discrimination was widespread, and many Armenians struggled against overt discrimination and housing restrictions. The Armenians living in central California were often referred to by natives as "Fresno Indians" and "lower class Jews."{{sfn|Mirak|1983|p=399}} This first wave of immigration lasted until the mid-1920s, when the new immigration quotas were passed. This wave of immigrants established Armenian communities and organizations in the US, most notably the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. In the 1920s, Armenians began to move from rural regions to cities.

===Second wave of immigration===
[[File:Armenian dancers in downtown Manhattan, 1976.jpg|thumb|250px|Armenian American dancers in New York City in July 1976 during the [[United States Bicentennial]]]]

A new wave of Armenian immigrants came in the late 1940s, including [[Soviet Armenia]]n prisoners of war who were able to make their way westward after being freed from [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Nazi camps]]. The [[Displaced Persons Act of 1948]] allowed people displaced during the World War II to immigrate to the US.<ref name="Powell"/> From 1944 to 1952, 4,739 Armenians migrated to the US,{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=34}} many with the help of [[George Mardikian]]'s American National Committee to Aid Homeless Armenians (ANCHA).{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=37}}

However, the true second wave of immigration did not begin until the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] abolished national origins quotas. After the passage of that act, Armenians from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkish Armenians|Turkey]], [[Lebanese Armenians|Lebanon]], [[Iranian Armenians|Iran]] and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating en masse to the US in the 1970s and 1980s, fleeing political instability in their host countries.{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=37}} In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The [[Istanbul riots]] in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life. 

The Armenians of USSR, on the other hand, were mostly survivors of the [[Armenian Genocide]] that never fully integrated into Soviet life after their repatriation in the 1940s. The large-scale emigration of Soviet Armenians, mainly to Western countries, began in 1956. About 30,000 Soviet Armenians entered the country from 1960 to 1984, and another 60,000 came throughout the late 1980s, during the [[Perestroika]] era.<ref name="Powell"/> The total number of Soviet Armenian emigrants from 1956 to 1989, over 80% of them to the US, is estimated at 77,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=M<U+00FC>nz|first=Rainer|title=Diasporas and ethnic migrants: German, Israel and post-Soviet successor states in comparative perspective|year=2003|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|isbn=978-0-7146-5232-0|page=160}}</ref>

The 15-year-long [[Lebanese Civil War]] that started in 1975 and the [[Iranian revolution of 1979]] greatly contributed to the influx of Middle Eastern Armenians to the US.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=11}} The Armenian communities in these Middle Eastern countries were well established and integrated, but not assimilated, into local populations. Armenians in Lebanon and Iran are represented in the parliaments as ethnic minorities. Many lived in luxury in their former countries, and more easily handled multilingualism, while retaining aspects of traditional Armenian culture.<ref name="Papazian"/> This wave of newcomers revitalized the Armenian American community, especially in the Los Angeles area,{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=8-9}} where most second-wave Armenian immigrants settled.{{sfn|Samkian|2007|p=101}} In 1970 about 65,000 Armenians resided in Southern California, and two decades later, in 1989, the number of Armenian Americans was estimated at 200,000.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=80}} Although the [[1980 US Census]] put the number of Armenians living in Los Angeles at 52,400, of which 71.9% were foreign born: 14.7% in Iran, 14.3% in the USSR, 11.5% in Lebanon, 9.7% in Turkey, 11.7% in other Middle Eastern countries (Egypt, [[Iraq]], [[Palestine]], etc.), and the rest in other parts of the world.{{sfn|Bakalian|1993|p=16}}

===Contemporary period ===
Immediately before and continuing into the time of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], waves of Armenians from the [[Republic of Armenia]] and other former Soviet republics arrived for political reasons and economic opportunities, settling in older established Armenian communities across the country.<ref name="Papazian"/> The [[1988 Spitak earthquake]] and the [[dark and cold years|energy crisis in Armenia]] during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] caused an estimated number of 700,000 Armenians to leave the country, most of whom ended up in Russia, still others in the US, and some in Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=M<U+00FC>nz|first=Rainer|title=Diasporas and ethnic migrants: German, Israel and post-Soviet successor states in comparative perspective|year=2003|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|isbn=978-0-7146-5232-0|page=161}}</ref> Annually, on average 2,000 people from Armenia migrated to the US since 1994, not including ethnic Armenians from Middle Eastern countries.<ref name="Powell">{{cite book|last=Powell|first=John|title=Encyclopedia of North American immigration|year=2005|publisher=Facts On File|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4381-1012-7|pages=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> According to the 2000 US Census, there were 65,280 Armenian-born people in the US: 57,482 in California, 1,981 in New York and 1,155 in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Region and Country or Area of Birth of the Foreign-Born Population: 2000|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=22 December 2012|url=http://archive.is/mX1a}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Region and Country or Area of Birth of the Foreign-Born Population: 2000 by state|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=22 December 2012|url=http://archive.is/mUMY}}</ref> According to the 2011 [[American Community Survey]], there were 85,150 Armenian-born people in the US, about 20,000 more than in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign-born population excluding population born at sea 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=22 December 2012|url=http://archive.is/dZM9}}</ref> According to the [[Embassy of the United States, Yerevan|US embassy in Yerevan]], about 21,000 citizens of the Republic of Armenia have moved to the US for permanent residency in the period from 1995 to 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gevorgyan|first=Siranuysh|title=Playing the Odds: End to US <U+2018>Green Card<U+2019> Lottery comes as disappointment for thousands of hopefuls in Armenia|url=http://www.armenianow.com/society/46921/armenia_united_states_green_card_diversity_lottery_end|accessdate=17 June 2013|date=14 June 2013|agency=[[ArmeniaNow]]}}</ref> Meanwhile, Armenian immigration from the Middle East continues, contributing to California's distinction of having by far the highest Armenian American population of any state.<ref name="Bedevian"/>

Up to three different 24-hour Armenian language television and radio channels are available. There are various social activities to attend for the Armenian community every day. Therefore, individuals exist who are not acculturated at all to the dominant American culture, as well as those who have chosen to separate from the Armenian community and acculturate completely, and many who are in the middle of acculturation spectrum.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kazandjian|first=Seta|title=The Effects of Bilingualism and Acculturation on Neuropsychological Test Performance: A Study with Armenian Americans|year=2006|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-542-84512-3|pages=27<U+2013>28}}</ref>}}

After the Soviets took over the power in Armenia in 1920, the Armenian American community was divided into two camps: one supporting Soviet Armenia (mostly members of the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hunchak]] and [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party|Ramgavar]] parties), another one against it (mostly made up of [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|ARF]] members). During the [[Century of Progress|1933 World's Fair]], [[Leon Tourian]], the primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, refused to give a speech, because the [[Flag of Armenia|Armenian tricolor]] of the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|1918-1920 Republic]] was hang behind him, while [[Etchmiadzin]], the seat of the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]], was in Armenia that was then part of the Soviet Union and used a different flag. This upset the Dashnak members present in the ceremony.

The three major Armenian political parties of late 19th century and early 20th century <U+2014> Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchak), [[Armenakan Party]] (later [[Ramgavar]]), were present in America not too long after their foundation.{{sfn|Ayvazyan|2003|p=42}} They established their own newspapers: ''[[Hairenik]]'' and ''[[Asbarez]]'' by [[Dashnaks]] and ''[[Baikar]]'' by Ramgavar's.

The efforts also include reaffirmation of a genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915.<ref name="Cameron, Fraser pp.91">Cameron, Fraser ''United States foreign policy after the Cold War'' The Armenian-American'lobby, Routledge 2002 p.91</ref>

According to Shawn Dorman, the author of ''Inside a U.S. embassy'', the main goal of Armenian lobby is the "persuasion of US Congress to favor Armenian interests, especially to [[Recognition of the Armenian Genocide|recognize]] the Armenian Genocide." He then claims that "it had significant role in the United States providing financial support to Armenia. From 1992 to 2010 the US provided nearly $2 billion, the highest per capita amount for a post-Soviet state."<ref>{{cite book|last=Dorman|first=Shawn|title=Inside a U.S. embassy: diplomacy at work|publisher=Foreign Service Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-9649488-4-6|year=2011|page=10}}</ref> Fund for Armenian Relief is a humanitarian organization providing long-term programs focusing on human development. [[Armenia Fund]] raises millions of dollars every year for infrastructural development in Armenia and [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. 

In 1992, Dr. [[Dickran Kouymjian]] of the [[California State University, Fresno]] stated in his essay:
{{cquote|All have refocused their efforts toward Armenia, providing financial and professional skill. The identification of Armenians with those in Erevan and Karabagh has been greatly facilitated by Armenia's membership in the United Nations and the regular reporting of its problems in the American press.. Diasporan history has been transformed by the Republic: nowhere is this more strongly felt than in America. The unifying force of the Genocide has been superseded by that of the Republic, while religious freedom in Armenia has revitalized the church in America and given it a mission. As the largest and most prosperous community in the world, as inheritors of a Protestant American work ethic, coupled with American self-righteousness, Armenian Americans feel they have a special role in the survival and success of the new state. They take pride in their support of Etchmiadzin, in the massive humanitarian aid given since the 1988 earthquake, in Armenians in high government positions, and particularly in the establishment of the American University of Armenia, the first major experiment in American higher education in the former Soviet Union. As English quickly becomes the second language of the new republic, Armenians in America feel closer to the homeland, suffering Armenia's tragedies and rejoicing in its successes. The Karabagh crisis, economic chaos, lack of basic amenities, and the threat of war fill all diasporan Armenians with an anxiety unknown before, because they know that their efforts may determine Armenia's fate.<ref name="Kouymjian"/>}}

===Armenian Genocide===
{{see also|Recognition of the Armenian Genocide|United States resolution on Armenian Genocide|Armenian Genocide Museum of America}}

The official recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the US federal government is seen one of the most vital steps in international and full recognition of the 1915<U+2013>1923 events. Many Armenians think that the US has the ability to force Turkey to recognize the past and pay Armenians and Armenia their reparations, that includes (for some) the return of the so-called [[Wilsonian Armenia]] to the Republic of Armenia. 

Several official US documents describe the events as "genocide" (1975,<ref name="Portraits of hope">{{cite book|last=Von Voss|first=Huberta|title=Portraits of hope: Armenians in the contemporary world|publisher=Bergahn Books|year=2007|page=36|isbn=978-1-84545-257-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. House of Representatives Joint Resolution 148|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.157/current_category.7/affirmation_detail.html|publisher=[[Armenian National Institute]]|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=9 April 1975}}</ref> 1984,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. House of Representatives Joint Resolution 247|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.158/current_category.7/affirmation_detail.html|publisher=[[Armenian National Institute]]|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=12 September 1984}}</ref> 1996<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 3540|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.159/current_category.7/affirmation_detail.html|publisher=[[Armenian National Institute]]|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=11 June 1996}}</ref>); President [[Ronald Reagan]] also described the events as "genocide" in his speech on April 22, 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armenian-genocide.org/Affirmation.63/current_category.4/affirmation_detail.html|title=Ronald Reagan, Proclamation, 22 April 1981|publisher=Armenian-genocide.org|date=22 April 1981|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> On March 4, 2010, the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs recognized the massacres of 1915 as "genocide."<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. House panel approves Armenia genocide resolution|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-03/05/c_13197636.htm|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=5 March 2010|newspaper=[[Xinhua]]}}</ref> Also, 43 of the 50 US states have made individual proclamations recognizing the events of 1915 to 1923 as genocide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial governments|url=http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/provincial_governments.php|publisher=Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute|accessdate=13 January 2013}}</ref> 

Armenian Americans gather in multiple towns and cities every year on April 24 for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The largest of such gatherings occurs in the Los Angeles area.

;Literature
Armenian American literature constitutes a diverse body of literature that incorporates American writers of Armenian ancestry. Encompassing a cross section of literary genres and forms, Armenian American writers often incorporate some common themes (e.g., the Armenian Genocide) while maintaining very personal literary styles. The New York-based ''[[Ararat Quarterly]]'', published since 1959, has been a major venue for Armenian American writing. ''Ararat'' is published in English by the [[AGBU]] and also includes works by Armenian writers around the world in translation. First-generation Armenian American writers include William Saroyan, [[Leon Surmelian]], [[A. I. Bezzerides]], [[Michael Arlen]],   [[Marjorie Housepian Dobkin]] and others. Second generation Armenian American writers include [[Peter Balakian]], [[Nancy Kricorian]], [[Carol Edgarian]], [[Michael J.
