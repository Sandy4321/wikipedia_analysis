'''Temple Israel''' is a [[Reform Judaism (North America)|Reform Jewish]] congregation located at 2004 East 22nd Place in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].<ref name=Homepage/> Founded in 1914, the [[synagogue]] affiliated with the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] in 1915, and constructed its first building on South Cheyenne Street in 1919. Early [[rabbi]]s included Jacob Menkes, Charles Latz, Samuel Kaplan, Jacob Krohngold, and Benjamin Kelsen.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p297/><ref name=Pilchik1943p322/>

In 1932, Temple Israel constructed a new building on South Cheyenne. Rabbis there included Hyman Iola, Abraham Shusterman, Randall Falk, and Morton C. Fierman. In 1955 the congregation moved to its current home, a building on East 22nd Place designed by [[Percival Goodman]]. Long-serving rabbis in this building were Norbert Rosenthal (1951<U+2013>1976) and Charles Sherman (1976<U+2013> ).<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p297/>

Membership rose from 170 families in 1943<ref name=Pilchik1943p322/> to 525 in 1979,<ref name=Wall1979/> but has since fallen to 425.<ref name=Homepage/> {{As of|2010}}, Temple Israel is the only [[Reform Judaism (North America)|Reform Jewish]] [[synagogue]] in Tulsa.<ref name=Homepage/> The senior rabbi is Charles Sherman, the rabbi is Anna Beroll and the [[hazzan|cantor]] is Kari Siegel-Eglash.<ref name=Staff/>

==Early history, South Cheyenne building==
Temple Israel was founded in December 1914, and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now [[Union for Reform Judaism]]) in 1915.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p297>[[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;297.</ref><ref name=Pilchik1943p322>[[#refPilchik1943|Pilchik (1943)]], p.&nbsp;322.</ref>  Its first religious leader was Abraham Feldman, who was, at the time, studying at the Reform [[Hebrew Union College]] in Cincinnati. He served until 1915. In 1917, the members hired Jacob B. Menkes as their first [[rabbi]]. He served until 1919, the year the congregation occupied its first permanent building (until then services had been held in a series of temporary premises).<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p297/>

Located at 1306 South Cheyenne and Fourteenth Streets,<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p297/> this historic building was, according to some sources, the oldest synagogue building in Oklahoma.<ref>See [[#refLoren2009|Loren (2009)]]. Note, however, that other claimants for "oldest synagogue building in Oklahoma" include [http://www.americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/TempleEmeth.html Temple Emeth] in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]] (1912), [http://www.pluralism.org/research/profiles/display.php?profile=75020 B'nai Emunah] in Tulsa (1916), and [http://www.emanuelokc.org/history.htm Emanuel Synagogue] in [[Oklahoma City]] (1917).</ref> The building was eventually abandoned and fell into disuse, occupied only by the homeless seeking shelter, and was severely damaged by a fire on January 27, 2009, in which the roof and floors collapsed.<ref name=Loren2009>[[#refLoren2009|Loren (2009)]].</ref><ref name=Stanley2009>[[#refStanley2009|Stanley (2009)]].</ref> In 2009, real estate developer Kevin Stephens stated that he planned to move forward with plans to save the facade of the building and develop the synagogue into a center for sustainability, community, and non-profit space.<ref name=Nicks2009>[[#refNicks2009|Nicks (2009)]], p.&nbsp;14.</ref><ref name=Easterling2009>[[#refEasterling2009|Easterling (2009)]].</ref>

The year the synagogue moved to South Cheyenne, Charles B. Latz succeeded Menkes as rabbi. That same year a synagogue sisterhood was formed, followed the next year by a brotherhood.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298>[[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;298.</ref> During the early 1920s the Tulsa [[All Souls Unitarian Church  (Tulsa, Oklahoma)|All Souls Unitarian Church]] (founded 1921) met for a time in Temple Israel's building.<ref name=JoyceHarris2007p213>[[#refJoyceHarris2007|Joyce & Harris (2007)]], p.&nbsp;213.</ref>

Latz served until 1924. He was followed by Samuel S. Kaplan, who served from 1924 to 1927, the Jacob P. Krohngold, who joined in 1927. 1929 saw three rabbis at Temple Israel; Krohngold, who left that year, Benjamin Kelsen, who came and left that year, and Hyman Iola.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/>

==South Rockford building==
During Iola's tenure, in 1932, Temple Israel moved to another building, at 16th and 1602 South Rockford, in what is now the [[Swan Lake (Tulsa)|Swan Lake]] [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]].<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/><ref name=TulsaPreservation>[[#refTulsaPreservation|Representative Sample of Properties, Swan Lake Historic District, Tulsa Preservation Commission website]].</ref> That same year the congregation formed a choir. Iola was succeeded in 1935 by Abraham Shusterman, who served until 1941. While Shusterman was rabbi, Temple Israel starting having [[Bar Mitzvah]] ceremonies, and added [[Torah]] readings to the Friday night services.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/>

Shusterman was replaced in 1941 by Ely E. Pilchik.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/> Pilchik had been born in [[Baranovichi|Baranowicz, Poland]], and had immigrated to the United States in 1920. He was a graduate of Hebrew Union College, but "was more traditional than the typical Reform rabbi".<ref name=Helmreich1999p257>[[#refHelmreich1999|Helmreich (1999)]], p.&nbsp;257.</ref> By 1943, the congregation had around 170 member families.<ref name=Pilchik1943p322/> Pilchik served until 1947, moving to Newark, New Jersey's Temple B'nai Jeshurun.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p215>[[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;215.</ref>

Randall M. Falk also joined as rabbi in 1945. His tenure was only one year, until 1946, and he focused on Temple Israel's religious school. In 1947 Morton C. Fierman joined as rabbi, succeeding Pilchik, and served until 1951.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/>

Fierman was succeed in 1951 by Norbert L. Rosenthal, who concentrated on "a variety of holiday celebrations and educational programs".<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/> In 1972, he allowed [[Oral Roberts]] to address the congregation at the bar mitzvah of a member.<ref name=PatelHartman2009>[[#refPatelHartman2009|Patel & Hartman (2009)]].</ref> Rosenthal served until 1976,<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/> becoming rabbi emeritus. In 1981, he assisted in the establishing of [[Temple Shalom of Northwest Arkansas]], and served thereafter as its first rabbi, visiting every other week to conduct Friday services.<ref name=GrayLeMaster1994p370>[[#refGrayLeMaster1994|Gray LeMaster (1994)]], p.&nbsp;370.</ref>

During Rosenthal's tenure, in 1955, the congregation moved to its present home at 2004 East 22nd Place,<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/><ref name=Homepage/> just south of the [[Utica Square]] Shopping Center.<ref name=About>[[#refAbout|About Us, Temple Israel website]].</ref>The South Rockford building was sold to Christ the King Catholic Church, which remodeled it so that it could be used as a [[fellowship hall]]. In 1975 it was renamed Fletcher Hall, after the former [[parish]] priest, and in 1991 it was removed to make way for a playground for students at [[Marquette Catholic School]].<ref name=TulsaPreservation/>

==East 22nd Place building==
Designed by prolific synagogue architect [[Percival Goodman]], the East 22nd Place synagogue's front is dominated by massive twin pillars displaying the [[Ten Commandments]],<ref name=Wall1979>[[#refWall1979|Wall (1979)]], p.&nbsp;8.</ref> which represent the biblical [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|Pillar of Fire]] and the [[Pillar of Cloud (theophany)|Pillar of Cloud]].<ref name=Kampfpp189-190>[[#refKampf1966|Kampf (1966)]], pp.&nbsp;189<U+2013>190.</ref> Goodman hired the sculptor [[Seymour Lipton]] to produce three works of ceremonial art for the sanctuary's ''[[bimah]]'', "a ''[[ner tamid]]'', a monumental seven-branch ''[[menorah]]'', and an abstracted, vine motif that is placed along the top of the [[Torah Ark]]."<ref name=Kampfpp189-190/><ref name=Gilbert2004>[[#refGilbert2004|Gilbert (2004)]].</ref>

Charles P. Sherman joined as rabbi in 1976. Sherman focused on education, and created programs for mixed Jewish/non-Jewish couples and [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]]. He was a strong supporter of the Oklahoma Chapter of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, and garnered support for it from the Southwest Council of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now Union for Reform Judaism).<ref name=Joyce1998p309>[[#refJoyce1998|Joyce (1998)]], p.&nbsp;309.</ref> He also "advocated social justice and religious action, as well as fuller participation in the Reform movement and community at large."<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/> In 1979, he presided over the bar mitzvah of future wrestler [[Bill Goldberg]].<ref name=Farhi1999>[[#refFarhi1999|Farhi (1999)]].</ref> That year membership was 525 families,<ref name=Wall1979/> but by 1995 that had fallen to under 500.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p298/>

{{As of|2010}}, Temple Israel is the only Reform synagogue in Tulsa, and has a membership of 425 families.<ref name=Homepage>[[#refHomepage|Temple Israel website]].</ref> The senior rabbi is Charles Sherman, the rabbi is Anna Beroll and the [[hazzan|cantor]] is Kari Siegel-Eglash.<ref name=Staff>[[#refStaff|Professional Staff, Temple Israel website]].</ref>
