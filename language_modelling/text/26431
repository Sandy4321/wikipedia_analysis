The Byrds' recording of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on April 2, 1968, some three years prior to any commercial release of the song by Dylan.<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="williams"/><ref name="list"/>  It was the lead single from The Byrds' 1968 [[country rock]] album, ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', and reached number 74 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Bllboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number 45 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="chart">{{cite web|title=The Byrds Billboard Singles|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifqxqw5ldfe~T51|accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref><ref name="chart2">{{cite book|author=Brown, Tony|page=130|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-71197-670-8}}</ref> Along with the then current line-up of The Byrds, the song also features musical contributions from session musician [[Lloyd Green]] on [[pedal steel guitar]].<ref name="fricke"/> Although it is not as famous as their cover version of "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", The Byrds' recording of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" is often considered by critics to be the band's best Dylan cover.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=You Ain't Goin' Nowhere - The Byrds' version review|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:kcfyxz80ldte|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref>

The song was selected as a suitable [[Cover version|cover]] by The Byrds after their [[record label]], [[Columbia Records]], sent them some [[demo (music)|demo]]s from Dylan's Woodstock sessions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John|year=2008|title=Hot Burritos: The True Story of The Flying Burrito Brothers|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-90600-216-9}}</ref>  Included among these demos were the songs "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" and "Nothing Was Delivered", both of which were recorded by The Byrds in March 1968, during the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] [[Studio recording|recording sessions]] for ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo''.<ref name="hjort"/><ref name="fricke"/>  Despite the change in musical style that the [[Country music|country]]-influenced ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' album represented for The Byrds, the inclusion of two Dylan covers on the album forged a link with their previous [[folk rock]] incarnation, when Dylan's material had been a mainstay of their repertoire.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|pages=269<U+2013>270|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>
 
The Byrds' recording of the song caused a minor controversy between the band and its author. Dylan's original demo of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" contained the lyric "Pick up your money, pack up your tent", which was mistakenly altered in The Byrds' version, by [[guitarist]] and singer [[Roger McGuinn]], to "Pack up your money, pick up your tent".<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|year=1997|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1997 CD liner notes)}}</ref> Dylan expressed mock-annoyance at this lyric change in his 1971 recording of the song, singing "Pack up your money, put up your tent McGuinn/You ain't goin' nowhere."<ref name="fricke"/> McGuinn replied in 1989 on a new recording of the song included on the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'' album, adding the word "Dylan" after the same "Pack up your money, pick up your tent" lyric.<ref name="byrdwatcher">{{cite web|title=Sweetheart of the Rodeo|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpsotr.html|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> McGuinn and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 recording of the song, which also featured The Byrds' former [[bassist|bass player]] [[Chris Hillman]], was released as a single and peaked at number six on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1989,<ref name="byrdwatcher"/> as well as number eleven on the Canadian country music charts published by ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]''.<ref name="rpm">{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.6409&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=grl62sl2b4d3lq956d4ncqj3d1|title=RPM Country Tracks for July 31, 1989|work=RPM|accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref> In spite of the involvement of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the single release was credited to McGuinn and Hillman alone.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2008|page=190, 273|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref>

After its appearance on ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'', the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds' [[Rock concert|live concert]] repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973.<ref name="timeless2">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|pages=591<U+2013>615|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The Byrds also chose to re-record "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" in 1971 with [[Earl Scruggs]], as part of the ''Earl Scruggs, His Family and Friends'' television special, and this version was included on the program's accompanying soundtrack album.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|page=335|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref> The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, [[David Crosby]], and Chris Hillman in January 1989.<ref name="timeless2"/>  McGuinn continues to perform the song in his solo concerts and consequently it appears on his 2007 album, ''Live from Spain''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Live from Spain product information|publisher=[[Sundazed Records|Sundazed]]|url=http://www.sundazed.com/product_info.php?products_id=886|accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref>

In addition to its appearance on the ''Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' album, The Byrds' original recording of "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" also appears on several of the band's [[Compilation album|compilations]], including ''[[The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II]]'', ''[[History of The Byrds]]'', ''[[The Byrds Play Dylan]]'', ''[[The Original Singles: 1967<U+2013>1969, Volume 2]]'', ''[[The Byrds (box set)|The Byrds]]'', and ''[[There Is a Season]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/>  Live performances of the song are included on the expanded edition of The Byrds' ''[[Untitled (The Byrds album)|(Untitled)]]'' album and on ''[[Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/>
