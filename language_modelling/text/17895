"'''Causing a Commotion'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].  It was released as the second single from the soundtrack album ''[[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|Who's That Girl]]'' on August 25, 1987 by [[Sire Records]]. Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the 1991 UK compilation EP ''[[The Holiday Collection (EP)|The Holiday Collection]]''. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Stephen Bray]], the song was inspired by Madonna's relationship with then husband [[Sean Penn]], and his abusive and violent nature. Containing a dance-oriented, up-[[tempo (music)|tempo]] [[groove (music)|groove]], the song begins with the [[chorus effect|chorus]] and is accompanied by a four-note descending [[bassline]] and [[staccato]] chords in the verse.

Since its release, the song has received mixed reviews by critics. It became a top-ten hit in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' U.S. dance chart. Madonna performed the song on the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] <U+2013> which was transmitted via satellite to the [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards]] <U+2013> and the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours.

==Background==
The song was written and produced by Madonna and long-term co-writer [[Stephen Bray]] for the ''[[Who's That Girl (film)|Who's That Girl]]'' film [[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. It was inspired by her then husband [[Sean Penn]] and their often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2000|p=211}}</ref> That translated as the inspiration behind the song. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song,
<blockquote>
"I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence sould have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it."<ref name="rsint">{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Senegal|date=1987-09-10|title=Madonna: She's That Girl|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|volume=1019|issue=32|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>
</blockquote>
In the United States, "Causing a Commotion" was released in August 1987.  In the United Kingdom, the song was released just before the commencement of Madonna's 1987 [[Who's That Girl Tour]] in October. In 1991, the Silver Screen Single Mix of the song was included on Madonna's ''[[The Holiday Collection (EP)|The Holiday Collection]]'' [[Extended play|EP]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=90}}</ref>

===Critical response===
The song received generally mixed reviews.

==Live performances==
Madonna performed "Causing a Commotion" on the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] of 1987 and the  [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990. In the Who's That Girl World Tour, "Causing a Commotion" was the sixth song of the setlist. Collaborating with Marlene Stewart on the clothes for the tour, Madonna expanded on the idea of bringing her video characters to life and to display a gangster theme for the song. She wore a golden [[Lam<U+00E9> (fabric)|lam<U+00E9>]] jacket and performed the song while accompanied by two dancers, each holding a gun.<Ref>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=66}}</ref> Performances of the song on this tour can be found on the ''[[Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan]]'' video, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987,<ref>{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=[[Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan]]|medium=VHS|publisher=Warner-Pioneer Japan|date=1987}}</ref> and on the ''[[Ciao, Italia! <U+2013> Live from Italy]]'' video, filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Phares|first=Heather|title=allmusic ((( Ciao Italia: Live in Italy (Video) > Overview )))|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:anfuxqt5ldse|work=''Allmusic''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-18}}</ref> The latter performance was transmitted via satellite to the [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/performers.jhtml|title=MTV Video Music Awards <nowiki>|</nowiki> Performers|work=''[[MTV]]''|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref>

On the Blond Ambition World Tour, the song was performed as the third song of the setlist. The outfit she wore for the performance was described by Carol Clerk, author of ''Madonnastyle'',  as the "perfect visual combination of masculine and feminine".<ref name="clerk">{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=84}}</ref> It consisted of a double-breasted suit with a tight jacket, which was cut in slits, allowing her conical bra to point through. She also wore her characteristic monocle chain. Madonna wore heavy makeup with thick, blackened eyebrows and heavy application of dark liner.<ref name="clerk"/> As she finished the performance of "[[Open Your Heart (Madonna song)|Open Your Heart]]", Madonna opened the jacket and started to simulate sexual intercourse with one of her dancers while playing the dominant role. It was followed by an exhibitionistic dance routine with a chair as a prop and Madonna singing the song. The performance ended with Madonna wrestling with her female backup singers.<ref name="clerk"/> Two different performances  were released on video: the ''[[Blond Ambition <U+2013> Japan Tour 90]]'', taped in [[Yokohama]], Japan, on April 27, 1990,<ref name="yokohama">{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=[[Blond Ambition <U+2013> Japan Tour 90]]|medium=VHS|publisher=Warner-Pioneer Japan|date=1990}}</ref> and the ''[[Live! <U+2013> Blond Ambition World Tour 90]]'', taped in [[Nice]], France, on August 5, 1990.<ref>{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=[[Live! <U+2013> Blond Ambition World Tour 90]]|medium=Laserdisc|publisher=Pioneer Artists|date=1990}}</ref>
