'''Keith William "Bluey" Truscott''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] [[Medal bar|& Bar]] (17 May 1916 <U+2013> 28 March 1943) was a [[World War II]] [[Air ace|ace]] [[fighter pilot]] and [[Australian rules football]]er with the [[Melbourne Football Club]]. He was the second highest Australian World War II ace credited with 20 confirmed victories and .5 unconfirmed victories.<ref name="Dennis" >Dennis et al (2008), p. 535.</ref>

==Early life and sporting career==
[[File:Melbourne high school cricket.jpg|thumb|left|The Melbourne High School cricket team. Miller is standing at right. Truscott is seated with shield.]]
Truscott was born in [[Prahran, Victoria]], on 17 May 1916, to William Truscott and Maude Truscott (n<U+00E9>e Powell). He attended [[Melbourne High School]], where he captained the First XI for the school in cricket. While there, he mentored the young [[Keith Miller]], who entered the First XI at the age of 14 and went on to be regarded as Australia's finest [[all rounder|all round]] cricketer. After completing his schooling Truscott worked as a school teacher and clerk.<ref name="Dennis" />

Truscott played 44 games (and kicked 31 goals) of [[Australian Football League|VFL]] football as a [[Football (Australian rules) positions#Half-forward flank|half-forward flanker]] from 1937<U+2013>1940, playing in Melbourne's 1939 and 1940 premiership victories.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==War service==
Truscott joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in July 1940, a move that attracted much publicity. He almost failed pilot training; among other problems it was ascertained that he had a poor ability to judge heights. In the words of the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'': "[Truscott] never fully came to terms with landing and persistently levelled out about 20&nbsp;ft (6&nbsp;m) too high."<sup><ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160503b.htm Truscott, Keith William (Bluey) (1916<U+2013>1943) Biographical Entry <U+2013> Australian Dictionary of Biography Online<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.adb.online.anu.edu.au</ref></sup> Nevertheless, Truscott completed flight training in [[Canada]] and joined [[No. 452 Squadron RAAF]], flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] in [[England]] on 5 May 1941.<ref name="Dennis" /> He destroyed at least 16 ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' aircraft, was twice awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and was made a flight commander.<ref name="Dennis" />

Truscott was later made acting [[squadron leader]] and in 1942, Truscott was posted back to Australia where he joined [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF|76 Squadron]], flying [[P-40|Kittyhawks]].<ref name="Dennis" /> By this stage Truscott was, along with [[Clive Caldwell]], one of the most famous RAAF pilots.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Truscott's squadron was posted to [[Milne Bay]], [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]] and played a significant role in the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] where he was [[mentioned in dispatches]] for his actions.<ref name="Dennis" /> 76 Squadron was later transferred to [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], for a time, and then [[Exmouth, Western Australia|Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia]]. Truscott was killed in an accident in Exmouth Gulf on 28 March 1943.<ref name="Dennis1">Dennis et al (2008), p. 536.</ref> His Kittyhawk hit the sea at high speed, after he made a mock diving attack against a low-flying [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]]. The surface of the sea was unusually smooth that day, and it is believed that Truscott misjudged its proximity. His body was recovered and he was buried at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref name="Dennis1" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/78315971 |title=Truscott's funeral |date=5 April 1943 |newspaper=The Daily News (Perth, WA: 1882&ndash;1950) }}</ref>

==Memorials==
Truscott's life and service was honoured in a number of ways. The RAAF later named a base on the northern coast of the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley region]] as [[Mungalalu Truscott Airbase|Truscott Airfield]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/airfields/australia/truscott/index.html |title=Truscott Airfield |publisher=Pacific Wrecks |accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref> The Melbourne Football Club's award for the [[Best and Fairest]] player was also named in his honour: the [[Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Medal|"Bluey" Truscott Memorial Trophy]].

At Melbourne High School, a scholarship is awarded in his name to a student displaying all-round achievement in academic, sporting and extra-curricular activities. For reasons unknown it was discontinued, apparently in 1948. In 1994, an Old Boy, Dr John Miller AO, winner of the 1946/47 Bluey Truscott Scholarship, Principal Ray Willis and the MHSOBA re-established the Bluey Truscott Scholarship. Dr John Miller provided the Bluey Truscott bronze plaque (hanging in the school foyer) and the "John Miller Distinguished Achievement Medal" to be awarded to all subsequent MHSOBA Bluey Truscott winners.

Truscott Street in [[North Ryde]], Truscott Avenue in Matraville, Sydney, and Truscott Street in [[Campbell, Australian Capital Territory]], are also named in his honour.
