== The Ship ==
The Japanese minesweeper '''''W-10''''', sometimes also referred to as '''''No. 10''''',<ref>{{cite web|last=Wikipedia contributers|title=No.7-class minesweeper (1938)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No.7-class_minesweeper_(1938)|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> was a [[minesweeper]] for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (sometimes abbreviated IJN).  It was laid down on 21 December 1937 at [[IHI Corporation|Ishikawajima Shipbuilding]], now known as the IHI Corporation.  It was launched just under a year later, on 22 September 1938. On 15 January 1939, ''W-10'' was attached to the [[Sasebo Naval District]], after being registered with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]].  On 1 June 1941 ''W-10'' was assigned to the [[3rd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet]], on MineSweepDiv 21, along with the [[minesweeper]]s W-7, W-8, W-9, W-11, and W-12.  On 27 November of the same year, ''W-10'' departed from [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]], and arrived at the [[Mako Guard District]] in [[Formosa]], a major base for the Imperial Japanese Navy.  On 7 December 1941, the [[Philippines Campaign (1941-42)|Japanese invasion of the Philippines]] began, starting with the [[Japanese invasion of Batan Island|invasion of Batan Island]], a fairly small island off the coast of the [[Philippines]].  On 10 December, an invasion force is sent towards [[Vigan]] and [[Japanese invasion of Aparri|Aparri]].  Despite poor weather, the forces still managed to land several troops on the islands.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Louis|title=The Fall of the Philippines|year=1953|publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army|location=Washington, D.C.|lccn=53063678|pages=102<U+2013>104|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/5-2/5-2_Contents.htm}}</ref>  While participating in the invasion of Vigan, ''W-10'' was attacked by Captain Samuel H. Marrett of the [[34th Pursuit Squadron]].  Marrett, in a [[Seversky P-35|P-35]], took multiple [[strafing]] runs against ''W-10'', until the ship blew up.  The explosion was so powerful it tore the wing off of Marrett's P-35, causing him to crash in to the sea.  Marrett also managed to do damage to [[Japanese transport Oigawa Maru|''Oigawa Maru'']] and ''[[Takao Maru]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/W-10_t.htm |title=IJN Minesweeper W-10: Tabular Record of Movement |last1=Hackett |first1=Bob |last2=Cundall |first2=Peter |year=2012 |website=combinedfleet.com |publisher= |accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref>
