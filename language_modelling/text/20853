'''Skorpa prisoner of war camp''' was a camp built by the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] to hold German [[Prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]] during the 1940 [[Norwegian Campaign]] of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Skorpa was the main PoW camp in Northern Norway and held around 500 civilian and military prisoners when it was shut down at the end of the Norwegian Campaign.

==Background==
With the outbreak of war between [[Norway]] and [[Nazi Germany]] following the German [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invasion of Norway]] increasing numbers of German prisoners fell into Norwegian hands in the fighting that followed. While many of these were soon liberated by the advancing German forces,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuav.net/fallschirm.html |title=The Fallschirmj<U+00E4>ger Battle at Dombaas  |accessdate=22 January 2009 |author=Bj<U+00F8>rn Jervaas |date= |work=Norway during world war 2 |publisher=}}</ref> the situation for those captured in [[Northern Norway]] was different. The Germans fighting [[Battles of Narvik|at Narvik]] were on the defensive against superior Norwegian and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces and any prisoners taken were sent behind Allied lines, outside the reach of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. Most of the Germans captured in Northern Norway were over time transferred to the small and isolated island of [[Skorpa, Troms|Skorpa]] in [[Kv<U+00E6>nangen]], [[Troms]] county.<ref name="Sandberg144">{{cite book |title=Vi ville sl<U+00E5>ss |last=Sandberg |first=Rei |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1945 |publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]] |location=Oslo |isbn= |page=144 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Access to the island was by boat.<ref>{{cite book |title=P<U+00E5> feil side |last=Fj<U+00F8>rtoft |first=Kjell |authorlink=Kjell Fj<U+00F8>rtoft |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]] |location=Oslo |isbn= |page=344 |pages= |url=http://www.nb.no/utlevering/nb/c173f5a6a42c7634d429ba3d9d223edd#&struct=DIV350 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==Construction==
When the first prisoners were sent to the camp they had to live in [[tent]]s designed for 16 occupants each. By May the construction of wooden barracks had begun, with the prisoners providing the labour force under the guidance of civilian Norwegian craftsmen. Around 100 prisoners were at any time taking part in construction work, much of this outside the [[barbed wire]]. The construction was overseen by a [[Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] of the Norwegian Army [[Military engineer|engineers]]. The barracks were meant to provide proper accommodation for the prisoners in the next winter.<ref name="Sandberg144"/>

==Camp population==
All Germans captured in Northern Norway were supposed to be gathered at Skorpa, the main Norwegian PoW camp in the region.<ref name="Sandberg144"/> Amongst the inmates at the camp were military personnel belonging to all services of the German ''Wehrmacht''; the ''[[Heer (1935<U+2013>1945)|Heer]]'', the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]''. In addition to the military prisoners there were also civilians from [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[merchant vessel]]s sunk or captured off the Northern Norwegian coast.<ref name="Sandberg144"/> In all some 500 Germans were imprisoned at Skorpa.<ref name="Fj<U+00F8>rtoft15">Fj<U+00F8>rtoft 1991: 15</ref><ref>Sandberg 1945: 138</ref> Because of the lack of an internment camp for civilian Germans the sailors were placed as an interim measure in the same camp as the military captives.<ref>Sandberg 1945: 152-153</ref> The senior German prisoner held at the camp was ''[[Frigate Captain|Fregattenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' [[Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs]], who had been captured after his destroyer was sunk during the naval battles off [[Narvik]].<ref>Sandberg 1945: 148</ref> Prisoners kept arriving at the camp until early June 1940; Germans that had been captured at the front-line near Narvik, shot-down pilots, and prisoners taken by the remaining pockets of Norwegian resistance on the coast of southern [[Helgeland]] and smuggled past German lines to Skorpa.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fiender og mennesker: krig over S<U+00F8>r-Helgeland |last=Skogheim |first=Dag |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |publisher=Br<U+00F8>nn<U+00F8>ysund bokhandel |location=Br<U+00F8>nn<U+00F8>yund |isbn=82-90963-00-9 |page= |pages=35<U+2013>43 |url=http://www.nb.no/utlevering/nb/7c991e7becb4bfce09735fabfdb04e4e#&struct=DIVP35 |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Norges krig |volume=1 |last=Steen |first=Sverre (ed.)|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1947 |publisher=[[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]] |location=Oslo |isbn=82-90963-00-9 |page=409 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref> 

The prisoners were guarded by 80 Norwegian soldiers, 45 of whom belonged to the [[Varanger Battalion]] from eastern [[Finnmark]] while the remaining 35 were troops that had escaped the collapse of the fighting in the southern parts of Norway and made their way to Northern Norway by way of [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]].<ref>Sandberg 1945: 136-140</ref> During the camp's existence two prisoners died. One merchant navy sailor was killed by a stray [[warning shot]] during a disturbance in the camp, and a pilot was shot when he approached the camp fence and failed to heed orders from a guard to stop. The pilot was buried with full [[Military funeral|military honours]] in the presence of 30 prisoners and a 14-strong Norwegian military honour guard.<ref>Sandberg 1945: 151, 162-164</ref>

==Dissolution==
On 5 June 1940, Captain [[Rei Sandberg]], the commander of Skorpa prisoner of war camp from early May 1940, received a call from the district military command asking how many airmen were held at the camp. At that time the number was 40, however later that day another 51 prisoners arrived at the camp, 19 of whom were airmen. Thus, when the order came in the late evening to transfer the 40 airmen to [[Harstad]] for interrogation at the British headquarters in Norway there were 59 Luftwaffe personnel at Skorpa. District Command concluded that it was best to send the requested 40 prisoners, rather than to send all 59. The 40 sent from Skorpa were the highest ranking of the 59, including all the pilots. None of these prisoners ever reached Harstad, instead being embarked on Allied ships and taken to the [[United Kingdom]] as the Allies [[Operation Alphabet|evacuated Northern Norway]] only days later.<ref>Sandberg 1945: 159-161</ref><ref>Skogheim 1990: 43</ref> Shortly after the departure of the Luftwaffe prisoners orders came through for the southern Norwegian soldiers guarding the camp to be transferred for front service against the Germans. Before any of the soldiers could leave Skorpa, however, word reached the camp at 0130hrs on 8 June of the forthcoming capitulation of the Norwegian mainland.<ref name="Fj<U+00F8>rtoft15"/><ref name="Fj<U+00F8>rtoft15">Fj<U+00F8>rtoft 1991: 15</ref><ref>Sandberg 1945: 166</ref> Many of the Norwegian guards left Skorpa prisoner of war camp on 10 June 1940, being sent to [[Altag<U+00E5>rd]] army camp in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] on two fishing boats. The German prisoners were told of the capitulation, released and transported from the camp under the leadership of Schulze-Hinrichs in the late evening of 12 June.<ref name="Fj<U+00F8>rtoft15"/><ref>Sandberg 1945: 172-174</ref> The last guards, belonging to the Varanger Battalion, left the camp on 15 June, with the commander and administrative officers departing on 19 June.<ref>Sandberg 1945: 179</ref>

==Aftermath==
Following the release of the German prisoners from the camp many of the Norwegian guards made their way over the mountains to Sweden to escape the German [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation of Norway]].<ref>Sandberg 1945: 181-182</ref> Captain Sandberg was arrested in late June 1940, accused of mistreating the prisoners while in charge of Skorpa,<ref>{{cite book |title=Meldungen aus Norwegen 1940-1945: die geheimen Lageberichte des Befehlshabers der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD in Norwegen, Part 1 |last=Dahm |first=Volker |authorlink= |coauthors=Stein Ugelvik Larsen (ed.) |year=2008 |publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag |location= |isbn=3486558919 |page=118<U+2013>119 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q_E--eQApUUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=skorpa&f=false |accessdate= |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name="Sandberg202208">Sandberg 1945: 202-208</ref> but released in August 1940.<ref name="Sandberg202208"/>
