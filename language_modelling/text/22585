'''John Uhler "Jack" Lemmon III''' (February 8, 1925 <U+2013> June 27, 2001) was an American [[actor]].  He starred in more than 60 films including ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (for which he won the 1955 Best Supporting Actor Academy Award), ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'', ''[[The Great Race]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'', ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (for which he won the 1973 Best Actor Academy Award), ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|The Out-of-Towners]]'', ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', ''[[Missing (film)|Missing]]'', ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'', ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' and ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]''.

==Early life==
Lemmon was born in an [[elevator]] at [[Newton-Wellesley Hospital]] in [[Waban, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]], a suburb of [[Boston]].  His mother was later quoted as saying "We didn't care that much about him and it was cheaper to push him out on the way up."{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} He was the only child of Mildred Burgess LaRue ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Noel) and John Uhler Lemmon, Jr., who was the president of a [[doughnut]] company.<ref>Lemmon stated (on Inside the Actors Studio) that he had an Ulster-Scots heritage.[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/lemmon.htm Family tree]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/18/Jack-Lemmon.html |title=Jack Lemmon Biography (1925-2001) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> Lemmon attended John Ward Elementary School in Newton and [[The Rivers School]] in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Massachusetts]]. He later revealed that he knew he wanted to be an actor from the age of eight. Lemmon attended [[Phillips Academy]] (Class of 1943) and [[Harvard University]] (Class of 1947) where he lived in [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]] and was an active member of several Drama Clubs - becoming president of the [[Hasty Pudding Club]] - as well as a member of the Delphic Club for Gentleman, a [[final club]] at Harvard. After Harvard, Lemmon joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]], receiving [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] training and serving as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]. On being discharged, he took up acting professionally, working on radio, television and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. He studied acting under [[Uta Hagen]]. He also became enamored of the [[piano]] and learned to play it on his own. He could also play the harmonica and the [[double bass]].

==Career==
Lemmon's film debut was a [[bit part]] as a plasterer/painter in the 1949 film ''The Lady Takes a Sailor'' but he was not noticed until his official debut opposite [[Judy Holliday]] in the 1954 [[comedy]] ''[[It Should Happen to You]]''. Lemmon worked with many legendary leading ladies, among them [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Betty Grable]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Doris Day]], [[Kim Novak]], [[Judy Holliday]], [[Rita Hayworth]], [[June Allyson]], [[Virna Lisi]], [[Ann Margret]], [[Sophia Loren]] and many, many more. He was also close friends with [[Tony Curtis]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Kevin Spacey]]. He made two films with Curtis, three films with Kovacs, and eleven with Matthau.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Early in Lemmon's career, Lemmon met [[Ernie Kovacs]]  during the filming of ''[[Operation Mad Ball]]'' <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050805/ IMDB entry for ''Operation Mad Ball'']</ref> and co-starred with the comedian in this film.  Lemmon and Kovacs became close friends and appeared together in two subsequent films - ''[[Bell, Book, and Candle]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051406/ IMDB entry ''Bell, Book, and Candle'']</ref> and ''[[It Happened to Jane]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052933/ IMDB entry for ''It Happened to Jane'']</ref> In 1977 [[PBS]] broadcast a compilation series of Kovacs' television work, and Lemmon served as the [[narrator]] of the [[Television program|series]].  Lemmon discussed his friendship with Kovacs in the documentary, ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083898/ IMDB entry for ''Ernie Kovacs: Television's Original Genius'']</ref>

He became a favorite actor of [[Film director|director]] [[Billy Wilder]], starring in his films ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'', ''[[The Apartment]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'', ''[[Avanti!]]'', ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''.  Wilder felt Lemmon had a natural tendency toward overacting that had to be tempered; the Wilder biography ''Nobody's Perfect'' quotes the director as saying, "Lemmon, I would describe him as a ham, a fine ham, and with ham you have to trim a little fat". The biography also quotes Jack Lemmon as saying, "I am particularly susceptible to the parts I play... If my character was having a nervous breakdown, I started to have one".

He also had a longtime working relationship with director [[Blake Edwards]], starring in ''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962), ''[[The Great Race]]'' (1965) and ''[[That's Life!]]'' (1986).

Lemmon recorded an album in 1958 while filming ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Twelve jazz tracks were created for Lemmon and another twelve were added. Lemmon played the piano and recorded his own versions of Monroe's trademark songs, ''I Wanna Be Loved By You'' and ''I'm Through With Love'', for the album which was released in 1959 as ''A Twist of Lemmon/Some Like It Hot''.

Lemmon was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor Oscar]] in 1956 for ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955) and the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] for ''[[Save the Tiger]]'' (1973), becoming the first actor to achieve this double.  He was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his role in the controversial film ''[[Missing (film)|Missing]]'' in 1982 and for his role in ''Some Like it Hot''. In 1988, the [[American Film Institute]] gave him its [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]].

''[[Days of Wine and Roses (film)|Days of Wine and Roses]]'' (1962) was one of his favorite roles. He portrayed Joe Clay, a young, fun-loving alcoholic businessman. In that film, Lemmon delivered the line, "My name is Joe Clay ... I'm an alcoholic." Three and a half decades later, he admitted on the television program, ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', that he was not acting when he delivered that line, that he really was a recovering alcoholic at the end of his life.

Lemmon's production company JML produced ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' in 1967.  [[Paul Newman]] was grateful to Lemmon for his support and offered him the role later made famous by [[Robert Redford]] in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' but Lemmon turned it down.  He did not like riding horses and he also felt he'd already played too many aspects of the Sundance Kid's character before.<ref>''A slice of Lemmon for extra character'', Bob Flynn, Panorama, p. 7, Canberra Times, August 15, 1998</ref>

Lemmon often appeared in films partnered with [[Walter Matthau]]. Among their pairings was 1968's ''[[The Odd Couple (film)|The Odd Couple]]'', as [[Felix Ungar]] (Lemmon) and [[Oscar Madison]] (Matthau). They also starred together in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (for which Matthau won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), ''[[The Front Page]]'' and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]''. In 1971, Lemmon directed Matthau in the comedy ''[[Kotch]]''. It was the only movie that Lemmon ever directed and Matthau was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his performance.

Additionally, Lemmon and Matthau had small parts in [[Oliver Stone]]'s 1991 film, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (the only film in which both appeared without sharing screen time). In 1993, the duo teamed up again to star in ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]''. The film was a surprise hit, earning the two actors a new generation of young fans.  During the rest of the decade, they would go on to star together in ''[[Out to Sea]]'', ''[[Grumpier Old Men]]'' and the widely panned ''[[The Odd Couple II]]''.

A rare death scene for Lemmon came in ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', for which he was awarded [[Prix d'interpr<U+00E9>tation masculine|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In [[1982 in film|1982]], he won another Cannes award for his performance in ''[[Missing (film)|Missing]]'' (which received the [[Palme d'Or]]). His characters died in very few films other than that one, 1989's ''[[Dad]]'' and 1999's ''[[Tuesdays With Morrie]]''.

At the [[55th Golden Globe Awards|1998 Golden Globe Awards]], he was nominated for "Best Actor in a Made for TV Movie" for his role in ''[[12 Angry Men (1997 film)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' losing to [[Ving Rhames]].  After accepting the award, Rhames asked Lemmon to come on stage and, in a move that stunned the audience, gave his award to him. (The [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]], which presents the Golden Globes, decided to have a second award made and sent to Rhames.).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

He received the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] in 1988.

==Personal life==
[[Kevin Spacey]] recalled that Lemmon is remembered as always making time for other people. When already regarded as a legend, he met the teenage Spacey backstage after a theater performance and spoke to him about pursuing an acting career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=Drnz1mbpui4 |title=Charlie Rose - Kevin Spacey / Jamaica Kincaid |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref> Spacey would later work with Lemmon in ''[[Dad (film)|Dad]]'' (1989), the critically acclaimed film ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' (1992) and on stage in a revival of ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''. Lemmon's performance also inspired [[Gil Gunderson]], a character on [[The Simpsons]] that is modeled on Lemmon's.

Lemmon was married twice. His son [[Chris Lemmon]] (b. 1954), was his first child by his first wife, actress [[Cynthia Stone]] (b. February 26, 1926, [[Peoria, Illinois]]). His second wife was the actress [[Felicia Farr]], with whom he had a daughter, Courtney, born in 1966, and another daughter, Kim Lemmon.

==Death==
Jack Lemmon died of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and [[metastasis|metastatic cancer]] of the [[urinary bladder|bladder]] on June 27, 2001.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Aljean Harmetz]] |coauthors= |title=Jack Lemmon, Dark and Comic Actor, Dies at 76 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/29/movies/jack-lemmon-dark-and-comic-actor-dies-at-76.html |quote=Jack Lemmon, the brash young American Everyman who evolved into the screen's grumpiest old Everyman during a movie career that lasted a half century, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 76 and lived in Beverly Hills. The cause was complications from cancer, said a spokesman, Warren Cowan.   |work=[[New York Times]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=2010-08-22 }}</ref> He had been fighting the disease, very privately, for two years before his death. He was interred at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], California where he is buried near his friend and co-star, [[Walter Matthau]], who died almost exactly one year before Lemmon.  In typical Jack Lemmon wit, his gravestone simply reads 'Jack Lemmon <U+2014> in'. After Matthau's death in 2000, Lemmon appeared with friends and relatives of the actor on a ''[[Larry King Live]]'' show in tribute. A year later, many of the same people appeared on the show again to pay tribute to Lemmon.

==Personal quotes==
{{Copy section to Wikiquote}}
*I won't quit until I get run over by a truck, a producer or a critic.
*Failure seldom stops you. What stops you is the fear of failure.
*If you think it's hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.
*It's hard enough to write a good drama, it's much harder to write a good comedy, and it's hardest of all to write a drama with comedy. Which is what life is.
*Nobody deserves this much money - certainly not an actor.
*Stay humble. Always answer your phone - no matter who else is in the car.
*[on Marilyn Monroe] Difficult? Yes. But she was a wonderful comedienne and she had a charisma like no one before or since.
*[on [[Judy Holliday]]] She was intelligent and not at all like the dumb blonds she so often depicted. She didn't give a damn where the camera was placed, how she was made to look, or about being a star. She just played the scene<U+2014>acted with, not at. She was also one of the nicest people I ever met.
*[on Billy Wilder] I've had directors who were marvelous at breaking scenes down and handling people. But when you would string all the pearls together, they wouldn't make a beautiful necklace. But Billy is the kind of picture-maker who can make a beautiful string of pearls. He makes the kind of movies that are classics and last forever.
*[on Walter Matthau] Walter is a helluva actor. The best I've ever worked with.
