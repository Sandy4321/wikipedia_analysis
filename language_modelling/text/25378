In the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] travels to a farm owned by Seth and Munchie, two aged hippies who were friends with [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Homer's mother]].

The episode was written by [[Donick Cary]] and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]], with a couple of scenes being directed by [[Matthew Nastuk]]. Kirkland, who was going through a divorce during the episode's production, assigned Nastuk, his assistant director, to take over direction in his stead. However, after Nastuk had directed a scene, Kikrland felt better and returned to direct the rest of the episode. The episode features the revalation of Homer's middle name, "Jay", which is a tribute to characters from ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'' who got their middle initial from [[Jay Ward]].

The episode features comic actors [[Martin Mull]] as Seth and [[George Carlin]] as Munchie. Carlin was suggested by ''Simpsons'' writer [[Ron Hauge]], who "really wanted to meet him," although he did not attend the recording session with Carlin and Mull. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 8.4 million viewers. Following the tenth season's home release on August 7, 2007, "D'oh-in in the Wind" received mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==

[[Mr. Burns]] plans on eating a jar of [[pickled cucumber|pickle]]s for lunch, but is unable to open the jar. Nobody else in the plant is able to open it, either. As a result, Mr. Burns decides he needs tougher employees, so he directs [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in an advertisement to promote the plant. When Homer sees what a good job he did in the commercial, even though no one read the script, he plans on becoming an actor. As he fills out his [[Screen Actors Guild]] form, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] points out that he has not filled in his middle name, having just put the initial "J". Homer admits that he does not know his middle name. He consults [[Abraham Simpson|Grandpa]] about it, who does not remember its origin ("he was in it for the spanking"), but suggests where it might be. They drive to a farm run by two middle-aged hippies, Seth and Munchie, who were friends of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Homer's mother]] back when she had been a hippie. They point out a mural she painted (based on an incident at [[Woodstock]] where a very young Homer ran around naked in the mud), which reveals Homer's middle name: "Jay". Homer sees how care-free his life would be if he were a hippie, and thus decides to become one.

Homer dons a filthy old poncho left behind by Mona and carries around a frisbee (which has "Homer Jay" enscribed on it) as part of his hippie guise. He visits the farm where he joins Seth and Munchie in their game of hackie-sack. The fun soon ends when Seth and Munchie have to go back to work, as they operate the most popular organic juice company in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] out of their barn. Because of this, Homer believes that they are not hippies and so convinces them to join him on an "old-time freak-out". After their little luck freaking out ordinary people, they return to the barn, only to find that it is flooded with Seth and Munchie's juice and broken bottles &mdash; revealed to be caused by Homer's frisbee ending up inside the "juicillator" machine, jamming it and thus ruining Seth and Munchie's shipment. In fury, they remind Homer that he is not, never was and at the rate he is going, never will be a hippie.

At night, Homer plans on making it up to Seth and Munchie by taking the crops from their garden and making the juice with them, which he then distributes to every store in town. However, due to a shortage of juicing crops, he also finds and uses some of their "[[Peyote|personal vegetables]]". As a consequence, anyone who [[Hallucinogen|drinks the juice has crazy hallucinations]]. [[Clancy Wiggum|Chief Wiggum]] catches on, and soon the police surround the farm. Homer comes out front to defend Seth and Munchie and hippie honor by reminding the police of the morals taught by the 1960s, planting a flower in each of their guns as he does so. However, Wiggum discharges his gun, lodging the flower from it in Homer's forehead. At the hospital, [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]] says he cannot remove the flower, as he claims he is not a gardener.

Originally, Kirkland was supposed to be the sole director for the episode, however, at the time, he was going through a divorce that he "did not see coming." Because of this, Kirkland assigned his assistant director, Matthew Nastuk, to direct the episode in his stead. However, after having directed a scene, Nastuk claimed that he was "terrified" and wanted Kirkland to continue the direction. Kirkland returned to direct the episode, feeling better after getting over the divorce. Despite the circumstances, Kirkland stated that he "loved" working on the episode, and could relate to the story since he had grown up in a "sort of hippie commune school" in the late 60's and early 70's. Kirkland based a lot of the scenery designs in the episode on the state [[Vermont]] where, according to him, a lot of "ex-hippies" live.<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2007).

The two hippies, Seth and Munchie, were portrayed by comic actors [[Martin Mull]] and [[George Carlin]] respectively. For a while, the staff were not sure of who would play Munchie. Although they had decided on Mull to play Seth, the staff were "kind of stuck" on who would play Munchie. Carlin was suggested by [[Ron Hauge]], one of the ''Simpsons'' writers, who "really wanted to meet [Carlin]" but ended up not going to the recording session.<ref name="Hauge">Hauge, Ron. (2007).

Following its home video release, "D'oh-in in the Wind" received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, Aaron Roxby of Collider wrote that, even though he felt that the jokes about hippies were "a bit overplayed," he still considered it to be one the best episodes of the season.<ref name="collider">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/dvd/article.asp/aid/5412/tcid/3 |title=DVD Review <U+2013> THE SIMPSONS - Season 10 |date=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2011|last=Roxby |first=Aaron |publisher=Collider}}</ref> James Plath of DVD Town thought fondly of the episode as well, calling it "funny."<ref name="dvdtown">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtown.com/review/simpsons-the-the-complete-10th-season/dvd/5056 |title=Simpsons, The: The Complete 10th Season (DVD) |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2011|last=Plath |first=James |publisher=DVD Town}}</ref> Writing for DVD Movie Guie, Colin Jacobson stated that, even though he feels the sixties have been lampooned "many, many times over the years," he considered "D'oh-in in the Wind" to be a successful spoof of the era. He enjoyed the way the episode portrayed and mocked the ways aging hippies "didn<U+2019>t live up to their youthful ideas." He concluded his review by writing that "D'oh-in in the Wind" is one of the first great episodes of the season.<ref name="DVDmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonten.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season (1998) |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2011|last=Jacobson |first=Colin |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref> 

On the other hand, Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News did not enjoy the episode. Considering it to be one of the worst episodes of the season, he found the "jabs" at the hippie culture to be dated, writing that the episode is "a quarter century too late."<ref name="dignews">{{cite web|url=http://www.dignews.com/reviews/the-simpsons-season-10-review/ |title=The Simpsons: Season 10 |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2011|last=MacNeill |first=Jake |publisher=Digital Entertainment News}}</ref> Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' were negative as well, calling the episode "dreadful." They wrote that, aside from a couple of references to sixties psychedelia and the hippie movement, the only significant part of the episode is the revelation of Homer's middle name. They concluded by writing that the episode is "humourless."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page5.shtml|title=D'oh-in in the Wind|accessdate=April 20, 2011|author=Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>
