==History==
In 1698 an Exchange was built to accommodate the city's administrators. This building burnt down in 1862. A competition was held to build a new town hall and this was won by [[William Henry Lynn]] of [[Belfast]]. The building cost <U+00A3>40,000 (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|40000|1869|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref>{{citation | last =Morriss | first =Richard K. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Buildings of Chester |edition= | publisher =Alan Sutton | date =1993 | location = Stroud| pages =77&ndash;79 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0 7509 0255 8 }}</ref> It was officially opened on 15&nbsp;October 1869 by the [[Prince of Wales]] (the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]) who was accompanied by [[William Gladstone|W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Gladstone]], the [[Prime Minister]].  On 27&nbsp;March 1897 the council chamber on the second floor was gutted by fire.  It was restored by [[Thomas Lockwood|T. M. Lockwood]] the following year.  In 1979 a clock was installed in the tower with three faces; there is no face on the west side of the tower.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=1| title = Town Hall | accessdate = 28&nbsp;July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}</ref>

Above the central two bays is a tower which terminates with [[gable]]s and a short diagonal spire.<ref name=pev>{{citation  | last =Pevsner | first =Nikolaus | authorlink =Nikolaus Pevsner | coauthors =[[Edward Hubbard]] | title =The Buildings of England: Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| date =2003| origyear=1971| location =New Haven| pages =158 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0 300 09588 0 }}</ref> The spire rises to a height of {{convert|160|ft|m|0}}.
