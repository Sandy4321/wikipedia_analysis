'''Hurricane Gladys''' was the first [[Atlantic hurricane]] to be observed each by the [[Hurricane Hunters]], radar imagery, and photograph from space. The seventh [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the [[1968 Atlantic hurricane season|1968 season]],<ref name="hurdat"/> Gladys formed on October&nbsp;13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a [[tropical wave]]. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October&nbsp;16. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h) just before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Homosassa, Florida|Homosassa]] on the western coast of Florida on October&nbsp;19. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of [[Cape Hatteras]] on October&nbsp;20. The next day, Gladys became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] and was absorbed by a [[cold front]] over [[Nova Scotia]].

In Cuba, the threat of the hurricane prompted widespread evacuations. Gladys caused [[flash flood]]ing and heavily damaged the tobacco crop. Damage in the country was estimated at $12&nbsp;million (1968&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]), and there were six deaths. While passing west of the [[Florida Keys]], the hurricane produced strong winds that briefly cut communications to the [[Dry Tortugas]], but damage was minor. Near where Gladys made landfall, winds gusted to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and tides reached {{convert|6.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal. There was heavy beach erosion and flooding along the coast, while the winds knocked down trees and caused power outages. Across the state, damage was estimated at $6.7&nbsp;million (1968&nbsp;USD), and three people were indirectly killed. Heavy rainfall in South Carolina caused minor river flooding. When paralleling just off the coast of [[North Carolina]], Gladys was responsible for breaking the state's worst drought since 1932, and proved more beneficial than the minor storm damage there. Later, Gladys killed two people in Atlantic Canada and caused coastal damage in [[Prince Edward Island]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Gladys 1968 track.png}}
The origins of Hurricane Gladys were from a [[tropical wave]] &ndash; a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] embedded in the [[trade wind]]s &ndash; that moved across the [[Lesser Antilles]] on October&nbsp;6. For the next few days, the wave moved across the [[Caribbean Sea]] without any development. As the wave interacted with the [[intertropical convergence zone]], a large area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] persisted across the region, spawning a series of [[low pressure area]]s. One became a tropical depression near [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Island]] offshore Honduras on October&nbsp;11, and two days later another tropical depression formed near [[San Andr<U+00E9>s (island)|San Andr<U+00E9>s]] island in the extreme southwestern Caribbean. The latter system, which would eventually become Gladys, moved slowly north-northwestward. An [[anticyclone]] in the region caused [[wind shear]] to decrease, allowing for gradual development. On October&nbsp;15, a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight observed winds of {{convert|52|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}; on that basis, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Gladys.<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal|volume=97|number=3|title=The Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1968|journal=Monthly Weather Review|date=March 1969|author=Arnold Sugg|author2=Paul Hebert|accessdate=2013-12-15|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1968.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

After becoming a tropical storm, Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Youth]] on October&nbsp;16.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite report|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Atlantic hurricane best track (HURDAT version 2)|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat2-atlantic-1851-2012-060513.txt|format=TXT|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=2013-06-18|accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba.<ref name="mwr"/> By the time the hurricane reached the southeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]], a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast. Gladys turned more to the north, passing just west of the [[Dry Tortugas]], before resuming its north-northwest trajectory, possibly due to a mid-level low near Alabama. Around that time, the [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida, and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation being over the state. Early on October&nbsp;19, Gladys made landfall near [[Homosassa, Florida|Homosassa]] after turning to the northeast,<ref name="mwr"/> with peak winds estimated at 85&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="hurdat"/> It accelerated across the state due to the approaching trough, emerging into the Atlantic near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States, Gladys passed just east of [[Cape Hatteras]] on October&nbsp;20, although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery. The approaching trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics, and on October&nbsp;21 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia. A few hours later, the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front.<ref name="mwr"/>

Hurricane Gladys was active during the [[Apollo 7]] spaceflight mission, and astronauts aboard took several pictures of the hurricane. Later, researchers were able to compare the photographs to airforce reconnaissance data, radar, and local weather networks, the first such hurricane to be observed with such varied data.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cecil Gentry|author2=Tetsuya Fujita|author3=Robert Sheets|date=December 1970|title=Aircraft, Spacecraft, Satellite and Radar Observations of Hurricane Gladys, 1968|volume=9|number=6|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0450(1970)009%3C0837%3AASSARO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Preparations==
In advance of the storm, Cuban officials forced about 36,000&nbsp;residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, along with 35,000&nbsp;livestock.<ref name="pbp1017"/><ref name="beaver"/> All flights were canceled in and out of Havana during the storm's passage. Many classes were canceled in the region, and workers took steps to minimize damage to the tobacco crop.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Kentucky New Era|date=1968-10-16|title=Hurricane Gladys Aims for Florida|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qucrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U2cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3960,1348767&dq=hurricane+cuba&hl=en}}</ref>

Shortly after Gladys became a tropical storm, the NHC issued gale warnings for the [[Florida Keys]] and later a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the southwest Florida coast from the Florida Keys to [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]]. After Gladys entered the Gulf of Mexico, the NHC issued hurricane warnings for the Florida Keys to [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]], with a watch to [[St. Marks, Florida|St. Marks]]. Later, hurricane warnings were issued from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to [[Hatteras, North Carolina]].<ref name="mwr"/> Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]] were closed, and officials evacuated 60&nbsp;jet fighters from [[MacDill Air Force Base]] to Mississippi. The [[HMS Sirius (F40)|HMS Sirius]], which was visiting [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The [[American Red Cross]] opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm,<ref>{{cite news|author=Donald Starr|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=1968-10-17|title=All Schools in Pinellas Are Closed|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_tgvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mVwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=hurricane%20gladys&pg=5232%2C4285801}}</ref> and about 40,000&nbsp;people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage.<ref name="beaver">{{cite news|newspaper=Beaver County Times|date=1968-10-21|accessdate=2013-12-16|title=Gladys Sweeps to Sea Leaving 4 Dead Behind|agency=United Press International|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=V0wyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=S7MFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1483,3025110&dq=hurricane+gladys&hl=en}}</ref> Then-governor [[Claude R.

==Impact==
[[File:Gladys 1968 rainfall.gif|thumb|right|250px|Rainfall from Hurricane Gladys in the United States]]
Before its first landfall in Cuba, Gladys produced wind gusts of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[Nueva Gerona]] on the Isle of Youth. Rainfall on the island was estimated at {{convert|8.49|in|mm|abbr=on}}. On the Cuban mainland, a station in [[Havana]] reported gale force winds for several hours. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, causing [[flash flood]]ing that damaged factories and crops; the tobacco crop sustained heavy losses to the extent that the [[Monthly Weather Review]] described it as "virtually wiped out".<ref name="mwr"/> In Havana, floodwaters from the storm wrecked houses and other buildings, while in [[San Antonio de los Ba<U+00F1>os]], residents required rescue from their flooded houses. After the storm, Cuban officials advised residents in Havana to boil their water to prevent the spread of disease, after water lines were damaged.<ref name="pbp1017"/> At least 36,000 people were left homeless as a result of the storm.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Hartford Courant|date=1968-10-18|title=Hurricane Sets Off Tornadoes}}</ref> Throughout Cuba, Gladys caused $12&nbsp;million in damage and six deaths.<ref>{{cite report|author=Roger A.

Farther north in Florida, hurricane-force winds were limited to a small area from Clearwater to [[Bayport, Florida|Bayport]], with peak gusts of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Winds in eastern Florida were not as strong. Gladys produced moderate rainfall across the state,<ref name="mwr"/> peaking at {{convert|12.46|in|mm|abbr=on}} at [[Cape Canaveral]].<ref>{{cite report|author=David M. Roth|title=Tropical Cyclone Rainfall in Florida|publisher=Weather Prediction Center|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/tcflorida.html}}</ref> Rainfall was generally less than {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}}, which limited flooding. The hurricane produced high tides near where it made landfall, reaching {{convert|6.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal; this caused heavy beach erosion and coastal flooding.<ref name="mwr"/> The town of [[Sunset Beach (Treasure Island)|Sunset Beach]] was almost entirely under water during the high storm tides. Elsewhere, the high waves wrecked boat houses, and portions of the seawall were washed out in [[Tierra Verde, Florida|Tierra Verde]].<ref name="climo"/> Gladys also spawned two tornadoes in the state, one each in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] and [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]].<ref name="mwr"/> The one in Boca Raton damaged a warehouse, while a waterspout in [[Whitfield, Florida|Whitfield]] damaged three homes.<ref name="ncdc"/> According to locals, several other tornadoes touched down in [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]] and [[Putnam County, Florida|Putnam]] counties, based on the falling of trees and visible twisting trail of damage<ref>{{cite news|author=Alma L.

In [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], most roads were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Wind damage was minor in northeastern Florida, despite a wind gust of {{convert|74|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. Two people died in the state due to storm-induced heart attacks, and another person died after driving into a flooded ditch.

The strongest winds were only along the immediate coastline due to the hurricane passing offshore. Gladys produced above-normal tides of {{convert|2|to|4|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="mwr"/> The storm knocked two houses off their foundations and severely damaged a business and a mobile home.<ref name="beaver"/> Rainfall in the state helped end break the worst drought since 1932, and the minimal storm damage was offset by the beneficial precipitation. In southeastern Virginia, the fringes of the storm produced wind gusts of {{convert|46|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and light rainfall in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].<ref name="mwr"/> Farther inland, rains from Gladys caused the [[Roanoke River]] to rise {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} near [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]], just below flood stage.<ref name="climo"/> Tides were about {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} above normal in the state, low enough to prevent major coastal flooding.<ref name="ncdc">{{cite journal|title=Storm Data for October 1968|volume=10|number=10|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS-0D52494B-6CAE-4DD8-AD82-5C9DD015325A.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Later, the extratropical remnants of Gladys produced beneficial rainfall of {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} over Atlantic Canada,<ref name="mwr"/> peaking at 5.03&nbsp;in (128&nbsp;mm) in [[New Brunswick]]. In the province, the former hurricane also produced 1.38&nbsp;in (35&nbsp;mm) of snow in [[Upsalquitch, New Brunswick|Upsalquitch]]. Precipitation from the storm spread as far west as Quebec and as far northeast as Newfoundland, causing flooding in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Wind gusts in the latter province peaked at 65&nbsp;mph (105&nbsp;km/h) in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]]. Along [[Cape Breton Island]], the remnants of Gladys killed one person and injured four. In [[Prince Edward Island]], wind gusts reached 85&nbsp;mph (137&nbsp;km/h) in [[Charlottetown]], strong enough to knock over a tree and kill a man driving in [[Alberton, Prince Edward Island|Alberton]]. The storm washed out a portion of a bridge near Alberton and part of a wharf in [[Miminegash, Prince Edward Island|Miminegash]], and damaged 35&nbsp;boats.<ref>{{cite report|date=2010-09-14|title=1968-Gladys|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=2013-12-16|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/Hurricane/default.asp?lang=En&n=1FFD6C78-1}}</ref> Ferry service was disrupted between the Canadian Maritime provinces.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun|date=1968-10-22|agency=Canada Press|title=Nfld.
