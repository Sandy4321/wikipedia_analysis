'''Moltke Nunataks''' ({{coor dm|77|58|S|35|30|W|}}) is a chain of north-south trending [[nunatak]]s close to the northeastern end of the [[Filchner Ice Shelf]]. One nunatak was first roughly mapped and named "[[Moltke Nunatak]]" by the [[Second German Antarctic Expedition|German Antarctic Expedition]], 1911-12, under [[Wilhelm Filchner]]. He named it for General Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the [[German General Staff]] and Sec. of State for [[Home Affairs]]. Surveys during the mid-1950s by British, Argentine and [[United States]] expeditions indicate a group of four or five nunataks exist in the area.
