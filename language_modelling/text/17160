'''Kristopher Joseph''' (born December 17, 1988) is a Canadian professional [[basketball]] [[small forward]] with the [[Brooklyn Nets]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. He played for the [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball]] team from 2008 to 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbadraft.net/players/kris-joseph |title=Kris Joseph |publisher=NBADraft.net |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> Kris is the brother of ex-Michigan State and [[Vermont Catamounts men's basketball]] player Maurice Joseph. Maurice is now the Assistant Director of Basketball Operations at George Washington University in Washington, DC. He is the son of parents Eartha and Michael Joseph, both born in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Kris is also second cousin to brothers [[Cory Joseph]], a reserve guard for the [[San Antonio Spurs]], and Devoe Joseph, who was the leading scorer for the [[Oregon Ducks]] of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] during the 2011<U+2013>12 season.

== Early life ==
Kris Joseph was born and raised in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], where he grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of [[Cote-des-Neiges]] north of downtown. Joseph first picked up a basketball in Grade 2 but was forced to shoot on garbage cans with his older brother Maurice due to a lack of courts in his low-income neighbourhood. A court was eventually erected in Cote-des-Neiges and the brothers battled for hours. <ref name="qhoops1">{{cite web|url=http://www.qhoops.net/articles/article.jsp?aId=755 |title=Welcome |publisher=QHoops |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

== High school ==
Joseph played in Maurice's shadow for a number of years as the older star gained prominence at noted Montreal-area prep school Champlain St. Lambert College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qhoops.net/articles/article.jsp?aId=734 |title=Welcome |publisher=QHoops |date=2005-03-17 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> Kris struggled at first against elite competition, getting cut from his club team at the age of 14.
He worked on his game, grew to 6-foot-6 and became a star for Sun Youth, a club-team powerhouse in the Montreal Basketball League.<ref name="qhoops1"/> As a tenth-grader, he led the Quebec provincial team to a silver medal at the 2005 Canada Games. He played for his High School team at Mont-Royal high school, the Mount-Royal Mustangs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100318/mtl_josephs_ncaa100318/20100318/?hub=MontrealSports |title=Montreal's Joseph brothers to battle on grand stage &#124; CTV Montreal News |publisher=Montreal.ctv.ca |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
