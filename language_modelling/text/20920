The '''Rumpler C.IV''' was a [[Germany|German]] single-engine, two-seat [[reconnaissance]] [[biplane]]. The C.IV was a development of [[Rumpler C.III|C.III]] with different tail surfaces and using a [[Mercedes D.IVa]] engine in place of C.III's [[Benz Bz.IV]]. In addition to the parent company, the aircraft was also built by [[Pfalz Flugzeugwerke]] as the '''Pfalz C.I'''. Another variant of the basic design was the '''[[Rumpler 6B|Rumpler 6B-2]]''' single-seat [[floatplane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]], with a 120&nbsp;kW (160&nbsp;hp) [[Mercedes D.III]] engine, built for the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy).

For a two-seater reconnaissance aircraft, Rumpler C.IV had an excellent performance, which enabled it to remain in front-line service until the end of [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], as well as in Italy and Palestine. Its exceptional ceiling allowed pilots to undertake reconnaissance secure in the knowledge that few allied aircraft could reach it.

For use during filming, [[Slingsby Sailplanes]] built two '''Slingsby T.58 Rumpler C.IV replicas'''. While these were visually similar to the original aircraft, they were structurally completely different, having a steel-tube fuselage structure and wooden wings, and being powered by a [[de Havilland Gipsy Major]] engine.<ref name="JAWA69 p225-6">Taylor 1969, pp. 225<U+2013>226.</ref>
