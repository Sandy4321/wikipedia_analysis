'''Jay Michael DeMerit''' (born December 4, 1979) is an American [[Association football|soccer]] player who is currently a free agent, having previously played for and captained [[Watford F.C.]]. He has 22 [[Cap_(sport)|caps]] for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].

==Career==
===Early career===
DeMerit was a three-sport high school athlete in Wisconsin, where he participated in [[basketball]] and [[Track and field|track]] in addition to soccer. He attended [[Bay Port High School]] and graduated in 1998.

DeMerit played [[college soccer]] at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], where he moved from playing forward to defender. While in college, DeMerit formed part of a defensive backline that helped lead the team into the NCAA playoffs in 2000. Although he played with [[Chicago Fire Premier]], the development team of the [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] in the [[USL Premier Development League]], he was not drafted or signed by any [[Major League Soccer]] clubs following graduation from college. Taking the advice of a former European teammate, he decided to take advantage of his [[European Union]] work status (due to his Danish grandfather) and moved to England in 2003 with only $1,800, in an attempt to find a club to play for. He started off playing in the ninth tier of English football for [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], earning only <U+00A3>40 a week.

In July 2004, DeMerit joined [[Northwood F.C.|Northwood]], a seventh-tier side, to play in some of their pre-season matches. Northwood played Championship side Watford, then a [[Football League Championship|League Championship]] side in their second pre-season match. During the course of the match, DeMerit impressed then Watford manager [[Ray Lewington]] enough to earn a two-week trial. Following the trial, DeMerit signed a one year contract with Watford to play in their [[2004-05 in English football|2004&ndash;05]] season and has been a regular in the Watford lineup until 2010, when he was released from his contract.

===Watford===
During the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season, Watford was expected by many to fight relegation from the Championship to [[Football League One|League One]] as they had in DeMerit's first season with the club. However, under new coach [[Aidy Boothroyd]], Watford maintained strong form throughout the season and finished third in the Championship table, earning the right to enter the playoffs for the last of three annual promotion spots to the Premier League. On May 21, 2006, in the play-off final against [[Leeds United]], DeMerit headed in the game's first goal and was named [[Man of the Match]] as Watford gained promotion to the Premier League by defeating Leeds United 3-0. Soon afterwards, he joined the ranks of athlete-musicians by releasing a single entitled "Soccer Rocks," available in the club shop.

DeMerit's hard work in the 2005&ndash;06 [[Football League Championship|Championship]] season and his efforts in helping get the club promoted was rewarded with a contract extension taking him through the end of the [[2008-09 in English football|2008&ndash;09]] season as a Watford player.

DeMerit was named as one of three candidates for Watford's [[2006-07 in English football|2006&ndash;07]] Player of the Season award, which was ultimately won by goalkeeper [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]].

Until the [[2007-08 in English football|2007&ndash;08]] season, DeMerit often filled the role of Watford's vice-captain, behind then-captain [[Gavin Mahon]]. He captained Watford for the first time on December 9, 2006, in the home game against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], and re-donned the armband on January 6, 2007, for the 4&ndash;1 win over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the [[FA Cup]] third round. On December 15, 2007, it was announced that DeMerit had been named captain, replacing Mahon, whose contract was not being renewed.<ref>[http://www.watfordfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1191845,00.html HUGE SHOES TO FILL | Watford | News | News | Latest Headlines<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, this later proved to be a temporary move, with the captaincy rotating between himself, [[Danny Shittu]], and [[Richard Lee (footballer)|Richard Lee]], before finally being passed to [[John Eustace]], a newly signed central midfielder. In later interviews, DeMerit admitted that this placed strain on his relationship with manager [[Adrian Boothroyd]].

Early in the [[2009-10 in English football|2009-10]] season, DeMerit suffered a scratch on his [[eyeball]] while removing a [[contact lens]]. DeMerit's eye became infected, severely obscuring his vision and requiring a [[corneal transplant]] in [[October]].<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/sports/soccer/94635724.html]</ref> He returned to action on December 7, 2009, playing the second half of Watford's 3-1 victory over Queens Park Rangers. Watford released DeMerit from his contract in June 2010.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8725765.stm] DeMerits Contract Not Renewed</ref>

==International career==
DeMerit earned his first cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] on March 28, 2007, starting in a friendly against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]].<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/6587074</ref> He was a member of the USA squad for the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

During the [[2009 Confederations Cup]], DeMerit started at center back due to [[Carlos Bocanegra]]'s hamstring injury.  He played the entire game when the USA defeated [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the Confederations Cup semi-final 2-0 on June 24, 2009; the Barcelona sports daily ''El Mundo Deportivo'' called DeMerit's play "superb".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} DeMerit also played the entire match when the USA lost 3-2 to Brazil in the Cup final on June 28, 2009.

For the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]], he made [[Bob Bradley]]'s 23-man squad, and started all three first-round games, against [[England national football team|England]] <ref>http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=249722/match=300061466/index.html</ref>, [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], and [[Algeria  national football team|Algeria]]. During the Algeria match he played most of the game with a split tongue that required five stitches after the game.<ref>http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2010/06/usa_world_cup_rewind_1.html</ref>
