'''''Animals''''' is the tenth studio album by English [[progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]], released in January 1977.   A [[concept album]], it provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from their earlier work. ''Animals'' was recorded at the band's studio, Britannia Row, in London, but its production was punctuated by the early signs of discord that several years later would culminate in keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] leaving the band. The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys on [[Battersea Power Station]], was conceived by bassist and writer [[Roger Waters]], and photographed by long-time collaborators [[Hipgnosis]].

The album was released to generally positive reviews in the United Kingdom (UK), where it reached #2. It was also a success in the United States (US), reaching #3 on the [[Billboard 200]], and although it scored on the American charts for only six months, steady sales have resulted in its certification by the [[RIAA certification|RIAA]] at four times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]. The size of the venues on the band's ''[[In the Flesh Tour|In the Flesh]]'' tour, and an incident in which Waters spat at a fan, prompted him to conceive the band's subsequent album, ''[[The Wall]]''.

==Background==
In 1975 Pink Floyd bought a three-storey block of church halls at [[Britannia Row Studios|35 Britannia Row]] in Islington.  Their deal with record company [[EMI]], for unlimited studio time in return for a reduced percentage of sales, had expired, and they converted the building into a recording studio and storage facility. Its construction took up most of 1975, and in April 1976 the band started work on their tenth studio album, ''Animals'', at the new facility.<ref name="Masonpp218220">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=218<U+2013>220}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=239}}</ref>

==Concept==
''Animals'' was the child of another Waters concept; loosely based on [[George Orwell]]'s political fable ''[[Animal Farm]],'' its lyrics described various classes in society as different kinds of animals; the combative dogs, despotic ruthless pigs, and the "mindless and unquestioning herd" of sheep.<ref name="Schaffnerp199">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=199}}</ref> Whereas the novella focuses on [[Stalinism]], the album is a critique of [[capitalism]] and differs again in that the sheep eventually rise up to overpower the dogs.<ref name="Schaffnerp199"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=241<U+2013>242}}</ref> The album was developed from a collection of unrelated songs into a concept which, in the words of author Glenn Povey, "described the apparent social and moral decay of society, likening the human condition to that of mere animals."<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2005|p=200}}</ref>

Apart from its critique of society, the album was also in part a response to the [[punk rock]] movement,<ref>{{citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA610 |author1=Browne, Pat |title=The guide to United States popular culture |chapter=Pink Floyd |page=610 |date=15 June 2001 |isbn=978-0-87972-821-2}}</ref> which grew in popularity as a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] statement against the prevailing social and political conditions, and also a reaction to the general complacency and nostalgia that appeared to surround [[rock music]]. Pink Floyd was an obvious target for punk musicians, notably [[Johnny Rotten]], who wore a Pink Floyd t-shirt on which the words "I hate" had been written in ink. Drummer Nick Mason later stated that he welcomed the "Punk Rock insurrection" and viewed it as a welcome return to the underground scene from which Pink Floyd had grown. In 1977 he produced [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]]'s second album, ''[[Music for Pleasure (The Damned album)|Music For Pleasure]]'', at Britannia Row.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=194<U+2013>196}}</ref>

{{listen | pos = right | filename = Pink floyd pigs.ogg | title = "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" | description = The "[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)|Pigs]]" on ''Animals'' represent the people whom Waters viewed as being at the top of the social ladder  | format = [[Ogg]]}}
In his 2008 book ''Comfortably Numb'', author [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]] argues that "[[Dogs (Pink Floyd song)|Dogs]]" contains some of [[David Gilmour]]'s finest work; although the guitarist sings only one lead vocal, his performance is "explosive".<ref name="Blakep243">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=243}}</ref>  The song also contains notable contributions from keyboardist Richard Wright, which echo the funereal synthesiser sounds used on the band's previous album, ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''.  "[[Pigs (Three Different Ones)]]" is audibly similar to "[[Have a Cigar]]", with bluesy guitar fills and elaborate bass lines from Gilmour.  Of the song's three pigs, the only one directly identified is morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]], who amongst other things is described as a "house-proud town mouse".<ref name="Blakepp243244">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=243<U+2013>244}}</ref>  "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]" contains a modified version of [[Psalm 23]], which continues the traditional "The Lord is my shepherd" with words like "he maketh me to hang on hooks in high places and converteth me to lamb cutlets" (referring to the sheep of the title).  Toward the end of the song, the eponymous sheep rise up and kill the dogs, but later retire back to their homes.  The album is book-ended by each half of "[[Pigs on the Wing]]", a simple love song in which a glimmer of hope is offered despite the anger expressed in the album's three other songs. Described by author Andy Mabbett as "[sitting] in stark contrast to the heavyweight material between them",<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=70}}</ref> the two halves of the song were heavily influenced by Waters' relationship with his then-girlfriend.<ref name="Blakepp243244"/><ref name="Mabbettpp7071">{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|pp=70<U+2013>71}}</ref>

==Recording==
''Animals'' was engineered by a previous Floyd collaborator, Brian Humphries,<ref name="Masonpp218220"/> and recording took place at Britannia Row from April to December 1976, continuing into early 1977.<ref name="Poveyp208">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=208}}</ref>  "Raving and Drooling" and "You've Got to Be Crazy", two songs previously performed live and considered for ''Wish You Were Here'', reappeared as "Sheep" and "Dogs" respectively.<ref name="Masonpp218220"/>  They were reworked to fit the new concept, and separated by a Waters-penned composition, "Pigs (Three Different Ones)".  With the exception of "Dogs" (co-written by Gilmour) the album's five tracks were written by Waters.  "Pigs on the Wing" was split into two, and since royalties were accorded on a per-song basis, Waters received more than Gilmour, despite "Dogs" occupying almost the entire first side of the album.  The song contains references to Waters' private life; his new romantic interest was Carolyne Anne Christie (married to [[Rock Scully]], manager of the Grateful Dead).<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=244<U+2013>245}}</ref>  Gilmour was distracted by the birth of his first child, and contributed little else toward the album.  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed as much toward ''Animals'' as they had on previous albums, and ''Animals'' was the band's first album not to give Wright a writing credit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=242<U+2013>243}}</ref>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=Roger's thing is to dominate, but I am happy to stand up for myself and argue vociferously as to the merits of different pieces of music, which is what I did on ''Animals''.

The band had discussed employing another guitarist for future tours, and [[Snowy White]] was therefore invited into the studio.  When Waters and Mason inadvertently erased one of Gilmour's completed guitar solos, White was asked to record a solo on "Pigs on the Wing".  Although his performance was omitted from the vinyl release, it was included on the [[8-track tape|eight-track cartridge]] version.  White later performed on the ''Animals'' tour.<ref name="Masonpp218220"/>  Mason recalled that he enjoyed working on ''Animals'' more than he had working on ''Wish You Were Here''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=220}}</ref>

==Packaging==

[[File:Battersea Power Station in London.jpg|alt=Photo of a large building with four tall chimneys.|right|thumb|[[Battersea Power Station]] was the subject for the cover image for ''Animals'']]
Once the album was complete, work began on its cover.  Hipgnosis, designer of the band's previous album covers, offered three ideas, one of which was a small child entering his parents' bedroom to find them having sex: "copulating, like animals!"<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=245}}</ref>  The final concept was, unusually, designed by Waters.  At the time he lived near [[Clapham Common]], and regularly drove past [[Battersea Power Station]], which was by then approaching the end of its useful life.  A view of the building was chosen for the cover image, and the band commissioned German company Ballon Fabrik (who had previously constructed [[Zeppelin]] airships)<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=201}}</ref> and Australian artist [[Jeffrey Shaw]]<ref name=medienkunstnetz>{{Citation|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pig-for-pink-floyd/|title= Jeffrey Shaw, Pig for Pink Floyd|publisher=medienkunstnetz.de|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref> to build a {{convert|30|ft|m}} porcine balloon (known as ''Algie'').  The balloon was inflated with [[helium]] and manoeuvred into position on 2&nbsp;December, with a trained marksman ready to fire if it escaped.  Unfortunately inclement weather delayed work, and the band's manager [[Steve O'Rourke]] neglected to book the marksman for a second day; the balloon broke free of its moorings and disappeared from view.  It eventually landed in [[Kent]] and was recovered by a local farmer, who was apparently furious that it had "scared his cows".<ref name="Blakep246">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=246}}</ref>  The balloon was recovered and filming continued for a third day, but as the early photographs of the power station were considered better, the image of the pig was later superimposed onto one of those.<ref name="Blakep246"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=223<U+2013>225}}</ref>

During the "Isles of Wonder" short film shot by [[Danny Boyle]] and shown as part of the Opening Ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the camera zooms down the length of the Thames River, from a small spring in the countryside all the way to the Olympic venue. During the fly-by, a pig can be seen floating above the [[Battersea Power Station]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/video/2012/opening-ceremony-the-isles-of-wonder.html |title=Opening Ceremony: The Isles of Wonder - Video |publisher=NBC Olympics |date= |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

The album's theme continues onto the record's picture labels.  Side one's label shows a [[fisheye lens]] view of a dog and the English countryside, and side two features a pig and sheep, in the same setting.  Drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s handwriting is used as a [[typeface]] throughout the packaging.  The [[gatefold]] features monochrome photographs of the dereliction around the power station.

In his 2004 autobiography ''[[Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd|Inside Out]]'', Nick Mason suggests that the album's perceived harshness, when compared to previous Floyd releases, may be a result of a "workman-like mood in the studio", and a subconscious reaction to the accusations from the afore-mentioned punk genre that bands like Pink Floyd represented "dinosaur rock".<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=220<U+2013>221}}</ref>  Animals was certified by the RIAA as 4X [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] on 31&nbsp;January 1995.<ref>{{Citation | title = Searchable database | url = http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH | publisher = riaa.com | accessdate = 2009-10-13}}</ref>

===Tour===
[[File:Soldier Field Chicago aerial view.jpg|alt=Photo of a large, empty stadium with a city skyline in the background.|right|thumb|The band played at the [[Soldier Field]] stadium in [[Chicago]] during their [[In the Flesh Tour]] in 1977.]]
The album became the subject material for the band's ''[[In the Flesh Tour|In the Flesh]]'' tour, which began in [[Dortmund]] on the same day the album was released.  The tour continued through Europe in February, the UK in March, the US for three weeks in April and May, and another three weeks in the US in June and July.  ''Algie'' became the inspiration for a number of pig themes used throughout.  An inflatable pig was floated over the audience, and during each performance was replaced with a cheaper, but explosive version.  On one occasion the mild [[propane]] gas was replaced with an oxygen-acetylene mixture, producing a massive (and dangerous) explosion.  German promoter Marcel Avram presented the band with a piglet in [[Munich]], only for it to leave a trail of broken mirrors and excrement across its mirrored hotel room, leaving manager O'Rourke to deal with the resulting fallout.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=225<U+2013>226}}</ref>

The band were joined by familiar figures such as [[Dick Parry]] and [[Snowy White]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=248<U+2013>249}}</ref> but relations within the band became fraught.  Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over.  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band.  The size of the venues was also an issue; in [[Chicago]], the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000&nbsp;capacity of the [[Soldier Field]] stadium, but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious.  They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=252<U+2013>253}}</ref>  The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who felt that they had by now achieved the success they originally sought, and that there was nothing else they could look forward to.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=230}}</ref>  In July 1977<U+2014>on the final date at the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Montreal Olympic Stadium]]<U+2014>a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat at one of them.  He was not the only person who felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, as Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual twelve-bar blues encore.<ref name="Masonpp235236"/>  Waters later spoke with producer [[Bob Ezrin]] and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience.  The spitting incident would later form the basis of a new concept,<ref name="Masonpp235236">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=235<U+2013>236}}</ref> which would eventually become one of the band's most successful album releases, ''[[The Wall]]''.
