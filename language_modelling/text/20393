'''Interstate 75''' ('''I-75''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and runs from [[Miami, Florida]], to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]].  I-75 enters the state from [[Ohio]] in the south, just to the north of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and runs generally north through [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], crossing the [[Mackinac Bridge]] and ends at the [[Canada|Canadian]] border in Sault Ste. Marie. The freeway runs for approximately {{convert|395|mi|km}} on both of Michigan's two peninsulas. The landscapes traversed by I-75 include [[Southern Michigan]] farmland, northern forests, suburban bedroom communities and the urban core of Detroit. The freeway also uses three of the state's monumental bridges to cross major bodies of water. There are four [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstates]] in the state related to I-75, as well as nine current or former [[Business routes of Interstate 75 in Michigan|business routes]], with either Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur I-75 (BS I-75) designations.

The freeway bears several names in addition to the I-75 designation. The southern segment was called the '''Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway''' during planning in the 1950s and 1960s. Through Detroit, I-75 is the '''Fisher Freeway''' or the '''Walter P. Chrysler Freeway''', named for pioneers in the auto industry. Sections on either side of the Mackinac Bridge are the '''G. Mennen Williams Freeway''' or the '''Prentiss M. Brown Freeway''', named for politicians that helped get the bridge built. Officially, the entire length is the '''American Legion Memorial Highway'''. Various sections carry components of the four [[Great Lakes Circle Tour]]s in the state.

Various [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails spanned the state along the general path of the modern freeway. After statehood, several of these were converted into [[plank road]]s that later became some of the first state highways. In the 1920s, five of these were added to the [[United States Numbered Highway System]]: [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US Highway&nbsp;2]] (US&nbsp;2), [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]], [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]], [[U.S. Route 25 in Michigan|US&nbsp;25]], and [[U.S. Route 27 in Michigan|US&nbsp;27]]. In the 1950s, a '''Michigan Turnpike''' was proposed as a [[toll road|tolled]], [[controlled-access highway]] in the Lower Peninsula. After passage of the [[Federal Highway Act of 1956]], this turnpike proposal was shelved as a free Interstate Highway was planned. Construction started in 1957, signs went up in 1959, and I-75 was completed in 1973. Since completion, the freeway has been upgraded with the construction of the [[Zilwaukee Bridge]] near Saginaw and improved connections to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] in Detroit.

===Lake Erie shore and the Downriver communities===
Crossing the state line north of [[Toledo, Ohio]], I-75 enters Michigan near the North Maumee Bay of [[Lake Erie]]. The freeway runs parallel to the shoreline of the Great Lake and past the community of [[Luna Pier, Michigan|Luna Pier]]. Further north, I-75 bypasses southeast of [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] and crosses the [[River Raisin]] between the city and the river mouth. North of the river, the freeway turns further inland running through farmland. Near [[Newport, Michigan|Newport]], [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] splits off to the northwest and I-75 continues its northeasterly trek through [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]]. When it crosses the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]], the trunkline passes into [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] between [[South Rockwood, Michigan|South Rockwood]] and [[Rockwood, Michigan|Rockwood]].<ref name=MDOT12>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |at= Section B11<U+2013>G11, G11<U+2013>M14, M14<U+2013>N13, main map; section B8<U+2013>E11, E11<U+2013>H9, Detriot Area  inset }}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |title= Overview Map of I-75 in Michigan |url= https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-75+N&daddr=42.41798,-83.08751+to:Sault+Ste+Marie+International+Bridge&hl=en&sll=46.496915,-84.358006&sspn=0.056958,0.058279&geocode=FbTHfAIdLBAG-w%3BFTw_hwIdai8M-ylN2vRw_M0kiDFiEnNGSZxgpQ%3BFaypxQId-sH4-g&oq=Sault&mra=ls&via=1&t=h&z=7 |accessdate= October 27, 2012}}</ref>

On the north side of the county line, I-75 begins to run inland of, and parallel to, the [[Detroit River]], entering the [[Downriver]] area. The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with [[M-85 (Michigan highway)|M-85]] (Fort Street) near [[Gibraltar, Michigan|Gibraltar]], and the [[Lake Erie Circle Tour]] departs I-75 to follow M-85 north of the interchange. The landscape transitions to suburban residential areas instead of farmland through this area. The freeway turns back northeasterly in [[Taylor, Michigan|Taylor]] and intersects the southern end of [[M-39 (Michigan highway)|M-39]] (Southfield Highway) in [[Lincoln Park, Michigan|Lincoln Park]]. I-75 crosses the the [[Ecorse River]] and passes through an industrial area of the Detroit Metro area. Further north, the freeway crosses the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] in the southern part of Detroit.<ref name= MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

I-75 runs parallel to M-85 (Fort Street) and follows the Detroit River as far east as the [[Ambassador Bridge]]. Near the bridge's approaches, the freeway turns 90<U+00B0> away from the river and intersects the eastern end of [[Interstate 96|I-96]] before turning again to parallel the river further inland. From there, I-75 meets [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (Lodge Freeway) and crosses under [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue). East of Woodward, the freeway runs past both [[Comerica Park]] and [[Ford Field]], homes of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Detroit Lions]] professional sports teams.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Detroit to the Tri-Cities===
[[File:I-75 Chrysler Freeway looking south.jpg|thumb|Looking south along the Chrysler Freeway to the Detroit skyline]]
Immediately east of Ford Field, I-75 turns northwesterly to follow the Chrysler Freeway away from the downtown Detroit. The transition from the Fisher Freeway involves a set of one-lane ramps through the interchange with the connections to [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|Interstate 375]] and [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|M-3]] (Gratiot Avenue). Heading north-northwesterly, I-75 passes to the east of the campus of [[Wayne State University]] and through an interchange with [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway). The Chrysler Freeway passes to the west of [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] and to the east of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], [[enclave]]s within Detroit. I-75 meets [[M-8 (Michigan highway)|M-8]] (Davison Freeway) and continues through residential areas of Detroit's northern side. North of [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]] (8&nbsp;Mile Road), the freeway crosses out of Detroit and into [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]. The Chrysler Freeway runs through the suburb of [[Hazel Park, Michigan|Hazel Park]],<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> site of the "worst freeway for accidents in Metro Detroit" at a curve near 9&nbsp;Mile Road.<ref name=oosting>{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Oosting |date= December 5, 2010 |title= Worst Freeway for Accidents in Metro Detroit?

Further north, I-75 intersects [[Interstate 696|I-696]] near 10&nbsp;Mile Road. The freeway continues northward for about {{convert/spell|6|mi|km}} into [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], where it turns westward. The route for I-75 zig-zags through Troy and [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] as the freeway alternates from north<U+2013>south to east<U+2013>west to bypass around [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. Near the [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]] interchange, I-75 passes the headquarters for [[Chrysler]], and near the [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] interchange, it runs near [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]], home of the [[Detroit Pistons]]. The freeway passes through additional suburban residential areas as it runs northwesterly away from Pontiac. These subdivisions end north of [[Clarkston, Michigan|Clarkston]], which is the location of of the northern terminus for [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&nbsp;24]]. Continuing through [[Holly, Michigan|Holly]] and [[Newark, Oakland County, Michigan|Newark]], the freeway transitions back to a rural, wooded setting.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

As I-75 approaches [[Grand Blanc, Michigan|Grand Blanc]], the landscape changes back to suburbs. [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] (UAW Freeway) splits off to the north to bypass around the east side of [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and I-75 merges with [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]] to turn northerly to run around the west side of the city. I-75/US&nbsp;23 meets [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] near the [[Bishop International Airport]] southwest of downtown Flint. The freeway continues northward along the western residential neighborhoods, meeting the northern end of I-475 near [[Mount Morris, Michigan|Mount Morris]]. I-75 passes to the west of [[Clio, Michigan|Clio]] and the east of [[Birch Run, Michigan]], the latter home to a large outlet mall. From there, the trunkline passes through farmland in southern [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw County]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Central Michigan===
[[File:I-75 MI exit 188.JPG|thumb|left|Split between I-75 and US&nbsp;23 west of Standish]]
I-75/US&nbsp;23 enters the southern reaches of the suburban [[Tri-Cities (Michigan)|Tri-Cities]] at [[Bridgeport, Michigan|Bridgeport]] and runs northward through the area. The freeway passes to the east of downtown [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]]. [[Interstate 675 (Michigan)|I-675]] splits to run westward into downtown, and I-75 curves around to the northwest to cross the [[Saginaw River]] on the [[Zilwaukee Bridge]] in the suburb of [[Zilwaukee, Michigan|Zilwaukee]]. North of the river, I-675 merges back in, and I-75 runs northward into [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay County]]. The freeway passes to the west of [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], encountering the eastern end of the [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] freeway. From there, I-75/US&nbsp;23 curves northwesterly to bypass [[Kawkawlin, Michigan|Kawkawlin]] before running north to the [[Standish, Michigan|Standish]] area through farmlands inland from the [[Saginaw Bay]]. West of Standish, US&nbsp;23 splits to run along the [[Lake Huron]] shoreline, and I-75 turns northwesterly to run inland.<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

West of [[Sterling, Michigan|Sterling]], the landscape changes again; the freeway passes into forests. I-75 continues northwesterly through [[Arenac County, Michigan|Arenac County]] and crosses into western [[Ogemaw County, Michigan|Ogemaw County]]. [[M-30 (Michigan highway)|M-30]] passes under the freeway without an interchange as I-75 passes to the west side of [[West Branch, Michigan|West Branch]]. On the northwest side of that city, [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]] merges onto I-75, and the two highways run concurrently westward into [[Roscommon County, Michigan|Roscommon County]].

===Northern Michigan===
[[File:I-75 MI exit 254.jpg|thumb|Exit&nbsp;254 south of Grayling]]
After the US&nbsp;127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, passing to the east of [[Grayling, Michigan|Grayling]]. There are a pair of interchanges on the on either end of town for [[Interstate 75 Business (Grayling, Michigan)|BL I-75]], and the southern one is a [[partial interchange]]; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access southbound I-75. There is no interchange further north for [[M-72 (Michigan highway)|M-72]]; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/[[M-93 (Michigan highway)|M-93]] that provides the southbound I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the [[Hartwick Pines State Park]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

Crossing into southern [[Otsego County, Michigan|Otsego County]], I-75 continue northward through [[Northern Michigan]] forests.

The freeway then passes through the west side of [[Gaylord, Michigan|Gaylord]] and continues through forests in the northern sections of the county. North of [[Vanderbilt, Michigan|Vanderbilt]], I-75 crosses into southern [[Cheboygan County, Michigan|Cheboygan County]],<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/> assuming the G. Mennen Williams Freeway name.<ref name=barnett88/>

I-75 runs northward through Cheboygan County, passing [[Indian River, Michigan|Indian River]] and crossing the [[Indian River (Mullett Lake)|river of the same name]]. The freeway passes through the area between [[Burt Lake|Burt]] and [[Mullett Lake|Mullett]] lakes. North of town, [[M-27 (Michigan highway)|M-27]] provides access to [[Topinabee, Michigan|Topinabee]] and [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]]; the latter city is also accessible by way of interchanges for [[C-64 (Michigan county highway)|C-64]] and [[C-66 (Michigan county highway)|C-66]], a pair of [[List of County-Designated Highways in Michigan|county-designated highways]]. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of [[U.S. Route 31 in Michigan|US&nbsp;31]] and picks up the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] designation before crossing into [[Emmet County, Michigan|Emmet County]] on the south side of [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]]. I-75 then runs northward parallel to the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US&nbsp;23. After that interchange, the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] merges in from the south. There is one more interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the [[Mackinac Bridge]]. I-75 uses the bridge to cross the [[Straits of Mackinac]] that separate Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form the connection between Lakes [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]] and [[Lake Huron|Huron]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

===Upper Peninsula===
[[File:Upper Michigan Welcome Sign I75.jpg|thumb|left|Welcome sign for the Upper Peninsula]]
North of the Mackinac Bridge, I-75 passes to the west of downtown [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], passing between the [[Father Marquette National Memorial]] and the [[Straits State Park]]. There is an interchange north of the toll plaza that marks the eastern end of [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]] in the state. The Lake Michigan Circle Tour departs I-75 to follow US&nbsp;2 while the Lake Huron Circle Tour follows [[Interstate 75 Business (St. Ignace, Michigan)|BL I-75]] through town. . The freeway curves around the [[Mackinac County Airport]] and meets the northern end of the business loop near [[Castle Rock (Michigan)|Castle Rock]]; the LHCT returns to I-75 at that interchange as well. [[M-123 (Michigan highway)|M-123]] (Tahquamenon Trail) intersects from the west as the freeway parallels [[H-63 (Michigan county highway)|H-63]] (Mackinac Trail), the former route of US&nbsp;2. I-75 crosses the [[Carp River (Mackinac County)|Carp River]] and runs along [[St. Martin Bay]] before meeting [[M-134 (Michigan highway)|M-134]]. At that interchange, the LHCT departs again to run eastward. Through this area, the freeway runs northeasterly, passing through the Eastern Unit of the [[Hiawatha National Forest]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/><ref name=RM13>{{cite map |publisher= Rand McNally |publisher-link= Rand McNally |year= 2013 |title= The Road Atlas |edition= 2013 Walmart |page= 50 |section= E8<U+2013>F8 |isbn= 0-528-00626-6}}</ref>

I-75 crosses the [[Pine River (Mackinac County, Michigan)|Pine River]] before passing into [[Chippewa County, Michigan|Chippewa County]]. The freeway takes a more northerly track as it passes under [[M-48 (Michigan highway)|M-48]] without an interchange. Further north, M-48 curves around to connect I-75 with [[Rudyard, Michigan|Rudyard]], and the freeway turns back to run northeastward. About {{convert/spell|5|mi|km}} northeast of Rudyard, I-75 passes next to [[Chippewa County International Airport]], the former [[Kincheloe Air Force Base]] in [[Kinross, Michigan|Kinross]] and [[Kincheloe, Michigan|Kincheloe]]. North of there in [[Dafter, Michigan|Dafter]], the freeway intersects [[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] (9&nbsp;Mile Road). Beyond that interchange, I-75 picks up the [[Lake Superior Circle Tour]] designation, which it carries the rest of the way north. On the south side of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], the freeway meets [[Interstate 75 Business (Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan)|BS I-75]] and picks up the Lake Huron Circle Tour designation one more time. I-75 runs around the west side of the city, passes the [[Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport]] and the campus of [[Lake Superior State University]] before meeting the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|customs]] and toll plazas for the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|International Bridge]]. From there, I-75 crosses the two-lane bridge and terminates at the [[Canada<U+2013>United States border|Canadian border]].<ref name=MDOT12/><ref name=google/>

==History==

===Indian trails to state highways===
[[File:Michigan's Indian trails.png|thumb|upright|Map of the pre-statehood Indian trails]]
Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails.<ref name=morrison1>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], p.&nbsp;1.</ref> The [[French-Indian Trail]] ran through southeastern Michigan between [[Toledo, Ohio]], Monroe and Detroit. The [[Saginaw Trail]] ran north from Detroit to the Saginaw area where it connected with the original [[Mackinaw Trail]] that ran roughly parallel to, and west of, the modern I-75. Another path, the Cheboygan Trail, ran parallel to the modern freeway to the east between the West Branch area and Cheboygan. In the UP, an extension of the Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie.<ref name=mason18>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;18.</ref> In the 19th century, the [[Michigan Legislature]] chartered private companies to build and operate [[plank road]]s or turnpikes in the state. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well.<ref name=morrison7-8>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], pp.&nbsp;7<U+2013>8.</ref> By the first decade of the 20th century, only 23 of the 202&nbsp;chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.<ref name= mason4>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref>

The [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|State Trunkline Highway System]] was formed on May 13, 1913, and several sections of the system were designated along the course of the then-future I-75. Division&nbsp;1 connected the Ohio state line northeasterly to Detroit, and Division&nbsp;2 connected Detroit with Mackinaw City. A branch of Division&nbsp;7 ran north from St. Ignace to Sault Ste. Marie.<ref name=STLHA>[[#MichLeg|Michigan Legislature]], p.&nbsp;1868</ref> The system was signposted in 1919,<ref name=press-1919-09-20>{{cite news |title=Michigan May Do Well Following Wisconsin's Road Marking System |work= [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date= September&nbsp;20, 1919 |page= 10 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref> and those highways were marked on maps for the first time.

==Freeway names==
I-75 has five named segments in Michigan. The southernmost section from the state line north to the Detroit area is the Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway.<ref name=WCRCreport>{{cite report |author= Board of Wayne County Road Commissioners |authorlink=Wayne County Road Commission |year= 1960 |title= Route Location Study: FAI&nbsp;75: Detroit<U+2013>Toledo Expressway to Rouge River |publisher= Michigan State Highway Department}}</ref> The segment through southern and central Detroit is known as the Fisher Freeway. It was dedicated on September 17, 1970, to the Fisher Brothers, who founded [[Fisher Body]] later a part of [[General Motors]].<ref name=barnett81-2>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;81<U+2013>2.</ref> After the curve in downtown Detroit, I-75 follows the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway northward. That segment is named for [[Walter P. Chrysler]], founder of [[Chrysler]]. The name was chosen by the Detroit Common Council on November 6, 1957, and codified in state law in 1990; the state definition for the name places the northern end of the designation at the Oakland<U+2013>Genesee county line.<ref name=barnett233>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;233.</ref>

Officially, the entire length of I-75 in Michigan is the American Legion Memorial Highway. As a practical matter, the southernmost segments retain their other names. The [[American Legion]] was honored with the designation in 1969 in a state law that required private interests to finance the signage. Public Act&nbsp;174 of 1984 redesignated I-75 in honor of the group and placed responsibility for signage in MDOT's hands.<ref name=barnett22-3>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;22<U+2013>3.</ref> Two other segments near the Straits of Mackinac were named in 1976 for figures instrumental in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge. From the Cheboygan<U+2013>Otsego county line north to the bridge, I-75 was named for [[G. Mennen Williams]], the former governor once called "Michigan's Politician of the Century" in the press.<ref name=barnett88>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;88.</ref> The section in Mackinac County from the northern end of the Mackinac Bridge was also named for [[Prentiss M. Brown]], the former [[U.S. House of Representatives|Congressman]] and [[U.S. Senate|Senator]] who served on the [[Mackinac Bridge Authority]] Board until his death in 1971.<ref name=barnett177-8>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;178<U+2013>8.</ref>

==Monumental bridges==
{{main|Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge|Mackinac Bridge|Zilwaukee Bridge|l1=International Bridge}}
[[File:Zilwaukee-Bridge-September-.jpg|thumb|left|Zilwaukee Bridge]]
Along its route in the state, I-75 utilizes three of Michigan's monumental bridges. The first of them is the Zilwaukee Bridge near Saginaw. The original bridge across the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built in 1960 as a [[bascule bridge]] to allow shipping traffic to use the river.

The second is the Mackinac Bridge that connects Michigan's two peninsulas at the Straits of Mackinac. A structure was first proposed in 1888 by one of the directors of the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]] on [[Mackinac Island]]. Carferry service was started in 1923 to cross the straits, and a bridge authority was first created in 1934 to investigate the possibility of building a permanent connection across the straits. They started with a 1921 proposal for a series of bridges that would have connected [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]] to [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]] by way of [[Bois Blanc Island (Michigan)|Bois Blanc]], [[Round Island (Michigan)|Round]], and Mackinac islands. The federal [[Public Works Administration]] rejected loan and grant requests for that project. A second, direct crossing was then proposed based on designs used for the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]]. The collapse of that bridge and [[World War II]] delayed any further work on a structure beyond tests of the lake bottom and the construction of the {{convert|4200|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} causeway on the St. Ignace side; the first bridge authority was abolished in 1947.<ref name=hyde159>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], pp.&nbsp;159<U+2013>66.</ref> The current agency was created on June 6, 1950.<ref name=Rubin13>[[#Rubin|Rubin]], pp.&nbsp;13<U+2013>7.</ref>

The [[Mackinac Bridge Authority]] was authorized in 1952 to sell bonds to finance construction,<ref name=hyde159/> which were sold on December 17, 1953, to finance the $99.8&nbsp;million cost of the bridge.<ref name=rubin103>[[#Rubin|Rubin]], pp.&nbsp;103<U+2013>7.</ref> The structure was designed by [[David B. Steinman]] and built by [[Merritt-Chapman & Scott]] for the substructure and the [[American Bridge Company]] division of [[U.S. Steel Corporation]] for the superstructure. Construction started in 1954 and the Mackinac Bridge opened to traffic on November 1, 1957. Final work on the bridge was completed in September 1958. Overall, the structure has a {{convert|3800|ft|m|adj=on}} central suspension span flanked by two {{convert|1800|ft|m|adj=on}} side spans. With the two backstay spans, the Mackinac Bridge is {{convert|8614|ft|m}} long between cable anchorages, the longest in the world at the time it opened.{{#tag:ref|The [[Akashi Kaiky<U+014D> Bridge|Akashi Kaiky<U+014D>]] and [[Great Belt Bridge|Great Belt]] bridges in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] are each longer between anchorages at {{convert|12826|ft|m}} and {{convert| 8,921 |ft|m}} respectively,<ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.mackinacbridge.org/about-the-bridge-8/ |title= About the Bridge |publisher= [[Mackinac Bridge Authority]] |accessdate= October&nbsp;28, 2012}}</ref> but the Mackinac is still the longest between anchorages in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref name=ASCE>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.asce.org/LandingPage.aspx?id=12884905060 |title= Mackinac Bridge |publisher= [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] |accessdate= October&nbsp;29, 2012}}</ref> and crosses a wider body of water.|group=lower-alpha}} The total lenth of the structure is {{convert|26444|ft|m}} with two {{Convert|555|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} towers and {{convert|155|ft|m}} of clearance for passing ships under the main span.<ref name=hyde159/> In 2010, the structure was named a [[National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]].<ref name=ASCE/>

The northernmost of the three monumental bridges along I-75 is the International Bridge, linking the twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Michigan]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Ontario]]. The governments on each side of the international border formed a bridge authority to build a highway bridge in 1935.<ref name=hyde159>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], p.&nbsp;159.</ref> Construction started on the structure September 16, 1960.<ref name=IBF>{{cite web |author= Staff |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9618_48384-30286--,00.html |title= Facts & Trivia |work= International Bridge |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |date= September&nbsp;12, 2008 |accessdate= October&nbsp;26, 2012}}</ref> The International Bridge is nearly {{convert/spell|3|mi|km}} long encompassing spans over the American and Canadian navigation channels for the [[Soo Locks]] and the [[St. Marys River (Michigan<U+2013>Ontario)|St. Mary's River]]. The American approach is {{convert|2471|ft|m}}, and the Canadian approach is {{convert|2942|ft|m}}. The center span over the river is {{convert|9280|ft|m}}, flanked by {{convert|1260|ft|m|adj=on}} and {{convert|830|ft|m|adj=on}} spans over the American and Canadian shipping channels, respectively. The bridge was designed by the same firm that handled the Mackinac Bridge for a cost of $20&nbsp;million.<ref name=hyde159/> It opened to traffic on October 31, 1962.<ref name=IBF/>

==Auxiliary routes==
There are four [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary Interstate Highways]] for I-75 in Michigan. [[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] begins as a loop from northern Monroe County and continues to connect with I-96 and I-696.

In addition to the auxiliary Interstates, there are eight current [[Business routes of Interstate 75 in Michigan|business routes]] related to the freeway in the state. These business loops and spurs provide signed connections into the downtowns of [[Interstate 75 Business (Pontiac, Michigan)|Pontiac]], [[Interstate 75 Business (Bay City, Michigan)|Bay City]], [[Interstate 75 Business (West Branch, Michigan)|West Branch]], [[Interstate 75 Business (Roscommon, Michigan)|Roscommon]], [[Interstate 75 Business (Grayling, Michigan)|Grayling]], [[Interstate 75 Business (Gaylord, Michigan)|Gaylord]], [[Interstate 75 Business (St. Ignace, Michigan)|St. Ignace]], and [[Interstate 75 Business (Sault Ste.
