'''Anglesey Airport''' ('''Maes Awyr M<U+00F4>n''' or '''[[RAF Valley]]''') {{Airport codes|HLY|EGOV}} is an airport owned by the Isle of Anglesey County Council on land leased from Defence Estates. The airport is situated on the island of [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]]. The leased site is part of RAF Valley, an RAF station teaching RAF pilots using [[BAE Hawk]]s.  The Airport is operated on the County Council's behalf by Operon.

Plans put forward in early 2006 by the [[National Assembly for Wales]] have led to a highly subsidised weekday air service between the airport and [[Cardiff International Airport]], 12 miles west of the Welsh capital in the hope of improving the econonomy of Anglesey and [[North Wales]] in general. The twice daily service operated by [[Highland Airways]] began in May 2007. Flights to [[Dublin]], [[London]] and [[Amsterdam]] are being discussed. The subsidised service is controversial; opponents argue that the public funding should have been invested in better rail links between North Wales and the capital.

For residents of Ynys Mon the air service is significantly quicker than surface transport. The flight time is around 40-45 minutes.

The new terminal was designed by MAP architects and is worth <U+00A3>1,000,000, with the publicly funded building contract having been given to the construction company [[Yorkon]]. The building was built off site and brought to the airport when finished. The new terminal is a single storey building consisting of a check-in desk, departure lounge and baggage handling areas as well as other visitor information areas.

The airport's principal stakeholders are
*RAF Valley
*[[National Assembly of Wales|The Welsh Assembly]]
*The [[Isle of Anglesey County Council]]
*[[Cardiff International Airport]]
