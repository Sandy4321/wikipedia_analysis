'''Saint Hildegard of Bingen, [[Order of St. Benedict|O.S.B.]]''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Hildegard von Bingen}}; {{lang-lat|Hildegardis Bingensis}}) (1098 <U+2013> 17 September 1179), also known as '''Saint Hildegard''', and '''Sibyl of the Rhine''', was a German writer, composer, philosopher, Christian [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], [[visionary]], and [[polymath]].<ref>Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), 317.</ref>  Elected a ''[[:wiktionary:magistra|magistra]]'' by her fellow nuns in 1136, she founded the monasteries of [[Rupertsberg]] in 1150 and [[Eibingen]] in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving [[morality play]].<ref>Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence. See: [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]; alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy. [http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html] and [http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]</ref>

She wrote theological, botanical and medicinal texts, as well as letters, [[liturgical]] songs, and poems, while supervising brilliant miniature [[Illumination (manuscript)|Illuminations]].

Hildegard has never been fully canonized as a saint by the Catholic church, so references to her as "Saint" are strictly honorary in terms of Catholicism; however her renewed canonization process is currently scheduled to be complete by October 2012.<ref>[http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html  '''Rome Reports'''] news site</ref>

==Biography==
Hildegard's date of birth is uncertain. It has been concluded that she may have been born in the year 1098.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 9.</ref> Hildegard was raised in a family of free nobles. She was her parents' tenth child, sickly from birth.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 17.</ref> In her ''Vita'', Hildegard explains that from a very young age she had experienced [[Vision (religion)|visions]].<ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002">Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), 7.</ref>

===Monastic life===
Perhaps due to Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning, Hildegard's parents, Hildebert and Mechthilde, offered her as a [[oblate]] to the church. The date of Hildegard's enclosure in the church is contentious. Her ''[[vita (disambiguation)|Vita]]'' tells us she was enclosed with an older nun, Jutta, at the age of eight. However, Jutta's enclosure date is known to be in 1112, at which time Hildegard would have been fourteen.<ref>Newman, Barbara. ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), 53.</ref> Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight, before the two women were enclosed together six years later.<ref>Michael McGrade, "Hildegard von Bingen", in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T.2, Vol. 8, ed. Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994).</ref> There is no written record of the twenty-four years of Hildegard's life that she was in the convent together with Jutta. It is possible that Hildegard could have been a chantress and a worker in the herbarium and infirmarium.<ref>Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), 8.</ref>

In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed at [[Disibodenberg]] in the [[Palatinate Forest]] in what is now Germany. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the enclosure. Hildegard also tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard Biblical interpretation.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), 6.</ref> Hildegard and Jutta most likely prayed, meditated, read scriptures such as the psalter, and did some sort of handwork during the hours of the Divine Office. This also might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]. [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could also have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.<ref>Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), 6.</ref>

Upon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as "magistra" of the community by her fellow nuns.<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 84.</ref> Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg, also asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]].<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 85.</ref> This was to be a move towards poverty,  from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. (New York: Routledge, 2001), 6.  When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent, however, until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, "Hildegard", ''MGG.''</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].

===Visions===
Hildegard says that she first saw "The Shade of the Living Light" at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions.<ref>Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), 77.</ref> She used the term 'visio' to this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others.  Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.<ref>Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), 10.</ref> Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 55.</ref> Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to "write down that which you see and hear."<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), 8.</ref> Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.<ref>Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), 78<U+2013>79.</ref> In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' ("Know the Ways"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:

<blockquote>But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close <U+2013> though just barely <U+2013> in ten years. [...] And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!'<ref>Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias,''  trans. by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop with an Introduction by Barbara J. Newman, and Preface by Caroline Walker Bynum (New York: Paulist Press, 1990) 60<U+2013>61.</ref></blockquote>

Hildegard's ''[[Vita]]'' was begun by Godfrey of Disibodenberg under Hildegard's supervision. It was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that Pope Eugenus heard about Hildegard<U+2019>s writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence. (New York; Routledge, 2001) 5.

Before Hildegard<U+2019>s death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. Hildegard of Bingen, 1098<U+2013>1179: a visionary life (London: Routledge, 1989), 11.</ref> 

On 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.<ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998"/>

==Works==
Hildegard's musical, literary, and scientific writings are housed primarily in two manuscripts: the Dendermonde manuscript and the Riesenkodex. The Dendermonde manuscript was copied under Hildegard's supervision at Rupertsberg, while the Riesencodex was copied in the century after Hildegard's death.

===Music===
Attention in recent decades to women of the medieval [[Catholic Church|Church]] has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard, particularly her music. In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).</ref>  This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard also wrote nearly 400 letters to correspondents ranging from [[Pope]]s to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperors]] to [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es;<ref>Ferrante, Joan. "Correspondent: 'Blessed Is the Speech of Your Mouth'", in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed. Barbara Newman (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 91-109.  The modern critical edition (vols. 91-91b in the ''Corpus Christianorum: Continuatio Medievalis'') by L. Van Acker and M.

{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title="O frondens virga"|description=From [[Ordo Virtutum]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}
One of her better known works, ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is unsure when some of Hildegard<U+2019>s compositions were composed, though the Ordo Virtutum is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098<U+2013>1179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), 102.</ref> The morality play consists of [[Monophony|monophonic]] melodies for the Anima (human soul) and 16 [[Virtues]]. There is also one speaking part for the Devil. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima and the Virtues.<ref>Audrey Ekdahl Davidson.  <U+201C>Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen<U+2019>s Ordo Virtutum.<U+201D>  ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), 1<U+2013>29.</ref>

In addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'' Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard<U+2019>s own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 194.</ref> Her music is described as [[Monophony|monophonic]]; that is, consisting of exactly one melodic line.<ref>Newman, Barbara. ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998),150.</ref> Hildegard's compositional style is characterized by soaring melodies, often well outside of the normal range of chant at the time.<ref>Bruce Holsinger, <U+201C>The Flesh of the Voice: Embodiment and the Homoerotics of Devotion in the Music of Hildegard von Bingen (1098<U+2013>1179).<U+201D>  ''Signs: Journal Of Women in Culture and Society'' 19 (1993): 92<U+2013>125.</ref> Additionally, scholars such as Margot Fassler and Marianna Richert Pfau describe Hildegard's music as highly [[melismatic]], often with recurrent melodic units, and also note her close attention to the relationship between music and text, which was a rare occurrence in monastic chant of the twelfth century.<ref>Margot Fassler.  <U+201C>Composer and Dramatist: <U+2018>Melodious Singing and the Freshness of Remorse,<U+2019><U+201D>  ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

''Hildegard of Bingen: An Integrated Version'' (Minnesota: Liturgical Press, 2001), 89.</ref> The reverence for the Virgin Mary reflected in music shows how deeply influenced and inspired Hildegard of Bingen and her community were by the Virgin Mary and the saints.<ref>Butcher, Carmen Acevedo. ''Hildegard of Bingen: A Spiritual Reader'' (Massachusetts: Paraclete Press, 2007), 27.</ref>

The definition of [[viriditas]] or <U+2018>greenness<U+2019> is an earthly expression of the heavenly in an integrity that overcomes dualisms. This <U+2018>greenness<U+2019> or power of life appears frequently in Hildegard<U+2019>s works.<ref>Madigan, Shawn. ''Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women<U+2019>s Spiritual Writings'' (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), 95.</ref>

Recent scholars have asserted that Hildegard made a close association between music and the female body in her musical compositions.<ref>Holsinger, Bruce. <U+201C>The Flesh of the Voice: Embodiment and the Homoerotics of Devotion in the Music of Hildegard of Bingen (1098<U+2013>1179),<U+201D>Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 19 (Autumn, 1993): 92<U+2013>125.</ref> The poetry and music of Hildegard<U+2019>s Symphonia is concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to Sappho, connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians.<ref>Holsinger, Bruce W. Music, Body, and Desire in Medieval Culture. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. 123<U+2013>135.</ref>

===Writings===
[[Image:Hildegard von Bingen Liber Divinorum Operum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|"Universal Man" illumination from Hildegard's ''Liber Divinorum Operum'', 1165]]
====Mysticism====
In addition to her music, Hildegard also wrote three books of visions, the first of which, her ''Scivias'' ("Know the Way"), was completed in 1151. ''Liber vitae meritorum'' ("Book of Life's Merits" or "Book of the Rewards of Life") and ''Liber divinorum operum'' ("Book of Divine Works", also known as ''De operatione Dei'', "On God's Activity") followed. In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was about 75, Hildegard first describes each vision, then interprets them through Biblical [[exegesis]]. 

The narrative of her visions was richly decorated under her direction, with transcription assistance provided by the monk [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] and nun Richardis. The book was celebrated in the [[Middle Ages]], in part because of the approval given to it by [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius III]], and was [[editio princeps|later printed]] in Paris in 1513.
====Herbal medicine====
Hildegard also wrote ''Physica,'' a text on the natural sciences, as well as ''Causae et Curae''. Hildegard of Bingen was well known for her healing powers involving practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), 155.</ref> In both texts Hildegard describes the natural world around her, including the cosmos, animals, plants, stones, and minerals. 

She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans.<ref>Hozeski, Bruce W. ''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), xi<U+2013>xii</ref> She is particularly interested in the healing properties of plants, animals, and stones, though she also questions God's effect on man's health.<ref name="medical" /> One example of her healing powers was curing the blind with the use of Rhine water.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098<U+2013>1179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), 9.</ref>

====Alphabet====
[[Image:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|200px|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]

Hildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.<ref name="Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002"/> Due to her inventions of words for her lyrics and a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her ''[[Lingua Ignota]]'' to increase solidarity among her nuns.<ref>Barbara J. Newman, "Introduction" to Hildegard, ''Scivias,'' 13.</ref>

==Significance==
===During her lifetime===
Maddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin, and the tenets of the Christian faith, but was not instructed in the Seven [[Liberal Arts]], which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age. New York: Doubleday, 2001. 40.</ref>  The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transgressed the cloister as a space of female confinement, and served to document Hildegard<U+2019>s grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.<ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997"/>

Contributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard <U+201C>authorized herself as a theologian<U+201D> through alternative rhetorical arts.<ref name="Dietrich, Julia 1997">Dietrich, Julia.  <U+201C>The Visionary Rhetoric of Hildegard of Bingen.<U+201D>  Listening to Their Voices: The Rhetorical Activities of Historic Women. Ed. Molly Meijer Wertheimer. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1997. 202<U+2013>214.</ref> Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should not allow novices who were from a different class than nobility because it put them in an inferior position. She also stated that <U+2018>woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman.'<ref name="Madigan, Shawn 1998">Madigan, Shawn. Mystics, Visionaries and Prophets: A Historical Anthology of Women<U+2019>s Spiritual Writings (Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 1998), 96.</ref> 

[[Image:Hildegard map.jpg|thumb|200px|Hildegard's preaching tours]]
Due to church limitation on public, discursive rhetoric, the medieval rhetorical arts included: preaching, letter writing, poetry, and the encyclopedic tradition.<ref>[[James A. Herrick|Herrick, James A.]] The History of Rhetoric: an introduction. 4th ed. Boston: Allyn Bacon, 2005.</ref> Hildegard<U+2019>s participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women<U+2019>s social participation and interpretation of scriptures. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman,
even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet does not fit the usual stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries.  She even preached publically in 1160 in Germany.  (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9).  She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2002. 28<U+2013>29.</ref>

Many abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters.<ref>Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. Medieval Europe: A Short History. New York: (McGrawl-Hill, 2001), 317.</ref> She traveled widely during her four preaching tours.<ref>Furlong, Monica. Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), 85<U+2013>86.</ref>  She had several rather fanatic followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote frequently to Hildegard and eventually became her secretary after Volmar died in 1173. In addition, Hildegard influenced several monastic women of her time and the centuries that followed; in particular, she engaged in correspondence with another nearby visionary, [[Elizabeth of Sch<U+00F6>nau|Elisabeth of Sch<U+00F6>nau]].<ref>Hildegard von Bingen, ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. by Joseph L. Baird and Radd K. Ehrman (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994/1998.) 180.</ref>

Hildegard communicated with popes such as [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] and [[Anastasius IV]], statesmen such as [[Abbot Suger]], German emperors such as [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], and other notable figures such as Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the [[Synod of Trier]] in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen<U+2019>s correspondence with many
people is an important element of her literary work because this is where we can see her speaking most directly to us.<ref>Schipperges, Heinrich. Hildegard of Bingen: healing and the nature of the cosmos (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), 16.</ref> 

===Beatification and scheduled canonization===
Hildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman [[canonization]] process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed, and she remained at the level of her [[beatification]]. Hildegard's name was nonetheless taken up in the [[Roman Martyrology]] at the end of the sixteenth century. Her [[feast day]] is 17 September. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including [[Pope John Paul II]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19790908_800-ildegarda_it.html |title=Lettera per l<U+2019>800<U+00B0> anniversario della morte di Santa Ildegarda |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> and [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060302_roman-clergy_en.html |title=Meeting with the members of the Roman Clergy |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-12-25}}</ref> Her canonization is scheduled to be completed before October 2012, when she will be declared a [[Doctor of the Church]].<ref>[http://www.romereports.com/palio/pope-to-canonize-and-name-hildegard-of-bingen-as-doctor-of-the-church-english-5666.html  '''Rome Reports'''] news site</ref> Hildegard<U+2019>s Parish and Pilgrimage Church house the [[relic]]s of Hildegard, including an [[altar]] encasing her remains, in Eibingen near [[R<U+00FC>desheim am Rhein|R<U+00FC>desheim]].

Hildegard of Bingen also appears in the [[calendar of saints]] in various [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] churches. In the [[Church of England]] she is commemorated on 17 September.

===20th-century interest===
Hildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary New Age movement, mostly due to her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. She was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's "Hildegard-Medicine", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings
together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.<ref>June Boyce-Tillman,  <U+201C>Hildegard of Bingen at 900: The Eye of a Woman,<U+201D>  ''The Musical Times'' 139, no. 1865 (Winter, 1998): 35.
</ref> Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic [[Rudolf Steiner]] lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]],<ref>Steiner, Rudolf. Karmic Relationships, Vol. 4 (1924)</ref> whose Sophianic visions are often compared to Hildegard.<ref>Powell, Robert.

In recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to feminist scholars.{{fact|date=April 2012}} Her reference to herself as a member of the "weaker sex" and her rather constant belittling of women, though at first seemingly problematic, must be considered within the context of the patriarchal church hierarchy. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), 10<U+2013>11.</ref> Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman,  <U+201C>Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,<U+201D>  ''Church History'' 54 (1985): 163<U+2013>175; Barbara Newman,  ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard<U+2019>s Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).</ref>  Hildegard used her voice to condemn church practices she disagreed with, in particular [[simony]].

In space, she is commemorated by the [[asteroid]] [[898 Hildegard]].
