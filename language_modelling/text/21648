'''Warrior''' was released in the [[Arcade game|arcades]] in [[1979]]. It is regarded as the first [[versus fighting game]].

Developed by [[Tim Skelly]] whilst working at [[Cinematronics]], it was released under the [[Vectorbeam]] company name shortly before Cinematronics closed Vectorbeam down; they had purchased the company [[1978]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caesar.logiqx.com/php/history.php?id=warrior |title=Warrior |accessdate=2006-10-28 |format=HTML |work= }}</ref>. The game featured two [[duel|dueling]] knights rendered in [[monochrome]] [[vector graphics]] and based on crude [[motion capture]] techniques.  Due to the limitations of the hardware used, the [[CPU|processor]] could not render the characters and gaming environment at the same time and backgrounds were printed, with the characters projected on the top.

==Controls==
Originally Skelly planned for a two player system with each player using two [[joystick]]s, one to control the movement of the player and the other controlling the player's weapon.  However, financial constraints restricted the cabinet to one stick for each player and a [[Button (control)|button]] to switch between character and weapon modes. The sticks were produced in house and installed in [[Arcade_cabinet|cabinet]]s in a way that found them unresponsive and difficult to use.

==Enduring influence==
The cabinets and hardware were produced on a low budget and proved to be very unreliable when compared to contemporary machines, as a result very few remain in working order, with only one known restored machine in the [[United Kingdom]]. Warrior is emulated by [[MAME]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caesar.logiqx.com/php/emulator_game.php?id=mame&game=warrior |title=Warrior |accessdate=2006-10-28 |format=HTML |work= }}</ref>.  The game is regarded as the first of the one-on-one fighting game genre, a style of game whose popularity would not blossom until the the early 90's.
