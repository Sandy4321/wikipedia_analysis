==Biography==

===Personal life===
Born '''Rosamunde E. M. L. Scott''' on 22 September 1924 in [[Lelant]], [[Cornwall]], daughter of Helen and Charles Scott, a British commander. Just before her birth her father was posted in [[Burma]], her mother remained in England.<ref name="WorldAuthors">{{Citation|author1=Vineta Colby|title=World authors, 1985-1990|year=1995|publisher=H.W.

From 1943 through 1946, Pilcher served with the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]].  On 7 December 1946, she married [[Graham Hope Pilcher]],<ref name="bookreporter"/>  a war hero and [[jute]] industry executive who died in March 2009.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/army-obituaries/5268578/Graham-Pilcher.html| title=Army Obituaries: Graham Pilcher | date=2009-05-03 | accessdate=2012-09-01 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100819104603/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/army-obituaries/5268578/Graham-Pilcher.html|archivedate=2010-08-19|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> They moved to [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]], where she still lives today.

===Writing career===
In 1949, Pilcher's first book, a romance novel, was published by [[Mills and Boon]], under the [[pseudonym]] Jane Fraser.  She published a further ten novels under that name.  In 1955, she also began writing under her real name with ''Secret to Tell''.  By 1965 she had dropped the pseudonym and was signing her own name to all of her novels.<ref name="bookreporter"/>

At the beginning writing was a refuge from her daily life. She claims that writing saved her marriage. The real breakthrough in Pilcher's career came in 1987, when she wrote the family saga, ''[[The Shell Seekers]]''. Since then her books have made her one of the more successful contemporary female authors.

One of her most famous works, ''[[The Shell Seekers]]'', focuses on Penelope Stern Keeling, an elderly British woman who relives her life in flashbacks, and on her relationship with her adult children.  Keeling's life was not extraordinary, but it spans "a time of huge importance and change in the world."<ref name="binchy">{{Cite news|last=Binchy|first=Maeve|authorlink=Maeve Binchy|title=War and Change Come to Temple Pudley|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/books/war-and-change-come-to-temple-pudley.html|date=1988-02-07|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref>  The novel describes the everyday details of what life during [[World War II]] was like for some of those who lived in [[Great Britain|Britain]].<ref name="binchy"/>  ''The Shell Seekers'' sold more than five million copies worldwide and was adapted for the stage by Terence Brady and Charlotte Bingham.<ref name="butt">{{Cite news|last=Butt|first=Riaza|title=Pilcher's winning formula|newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/entertainment/arts/s/82/82350_pilchers_winning_formula.html|date=2004-02-25|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref>

Pilcher retired from writing in 2000.<ref name="bookreporter"/>  Two years later she was created an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE).<ref name="obe">{{cite news|title=Honours in the arts world|publisher=BBC News|date=2001-12-31|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1734545.stm|accessdate=2012-09-01}}</ref>

===TV adaptation===
Her books are especially popular in Germany because the national TV station [[ZDF]] (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen) has produced more than 100 of her stories for TV starting with "Day of the Storm". These TV films are some of the most popular programmes on ZDF. Both ZDF programme director Dr. Claus Beling and Rosamunde Pilcher were awarded the British Tourism Award in 2002 for the positive effect the books and the TV versions had on Cornwall and Devon tourism within the UK. Notable film locations include [[Prideaux Place]], an Elizabethan Manor with extensive grounds in [[Padstow]]; the 9th century stately home in [[St Germans, Cornwall|St Germans]], [[Port Eliot]]; The [[Duke of Cornwall Hotel]], an 1863 [[Victorian Gothic]] building in [[Plymouth]]; and much of the coast line of Chapel Porth. However, a number of films whose story setting is Cornwall are in fact filmed elsewhere.

===DVD releases===
Rosamunde Pilcher's ''Coming Home, Winter Solstice and Summer Solstice'' are all available on DVD in the UK, distributed by [[Acorn Media UK]].
