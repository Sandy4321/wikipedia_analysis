The '''Toyota Camry (XV50)''' is a [[mid-size car]] that has been produced by [[Toyota]] since September 2011. Replacing the [[Toyota Camry (XV40)|XV40]] series, the XV50 represents the seventh generation of the [[Toyota Camry]] in all markets outside of Japan, which follows a different generational lineage.

==Development==
The new Camry was introduced on August 23, 2011, and began U.S. sales in September 2011.<ref name= NYTCamry12>{{cite news|url=http://www.insideline.com/toyota/camry/2012/2012-toyota-camry-to-hit-showrooms-ahead-of-schedule.html |title=2012 Toyota Camry To Hit Showrooms Ahead of Schedule |first=Anita |last=Lienert|work=Edmunds.com|date=2011-09-02 |accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref> The interior received a major restyling, while the exterior received all-new sheet metal and more angular styling. Power options are the 2.5-liter [[Toyota AR engine#2AR-FE|2AR-FE]] 4-cylinder and the 3.5-liter [[Toyota GR engine#2GR-FE|2GR-FE]] V6. The power output for the 2AR-FE was increased to {{convert|178|hp|kW|abbr=on|0|disp=flip}} across the entire product line while the power output for the V6 remained unchanged. EPA fuel economy numbers for both engines increased, with the [[V6]] increased to {{convert|21|mpgus|abbr=on|0}} city cycle, {{convert|30|mpgus|abbr=on|0}} highway cycle and the [[Inline-four engine|4-cylinder]] having {{convert|25|mpgus|abbr=on|0}} city cycle and {{convert|35|mpgus|abbr=on|0}} highway cycle.<ref name>{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/compx2008f.jsp?year=2012&make=Toyota&model=Camry&hiddenField=Findacar |title=Vehicle Table - 2012 Toyota Camry |work=http://www.fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref> The engine produces 170 foot-pounds of torque.

The new Camry is the first Camry to be offered in the U.S. without a [[manual transmission]], as demand for the manual was low and dealers preferred not to stock them. The U.S. Camry is standard with a 6-speed [[automatic transmission]], with all SE models having sports paddle shifters for manual shifts.  [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] is still offered on hybrid models.

==Equipment==
===United States===
The U.S. SE model is fitted with a sports-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels (with 18-inch alloys on V6 models), fog lamps, unique interior and exterior styling treatment, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, sport seats, and shift paddles to differentiate it from the rest of the line-up. Despite similar exterior dimensions with the XV40 Camry, Toyota was able to increase the interior volume by restyling the interior panels so that they follow the contour of the exterior panels. Toyota also made more use of high-strength steel, leading to weight savings and increased fuel economy.

Prices in the U.S. start at {{USD|21,955}}. The SE, XLE trims and the hybrid had no price change or a reduction of between $200 and $2000 with respect to the previous year. The Camry LE had a price increase of $710, while the new base level Camry L was introduced to the lineup.<ref name=CD0812>{{cite news|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/toyota-prices-2012-camry-from-22715-hybrid-model-rated-at-43-mpg-city/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+caranddriver%2Fblog+%28Car+and+Driver%29&utm_content=Google+Reader|title=Toyota Prices 2012 Camry from $22,715; Hybrid Model Rated at 43 mpg City|author=Alexander Stoklosa|work=Car and Driver |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref>

===Australasia===
<!-- Note: 'Australasia' means Australia, New Zealand and possibly New Guinea. It is not a typing mistake for 'Australia' -->
Camry models in Australia and New Zealand have a new two-tier naming and styling structure. Altise remains the base model while Ateva, Sportivo and Grande have been replaced by the Atara S, SX and SL. Australian Camrys have different interior fabrics, colour, and trim as well as the steering and suspension settings that were adapted for the local market. The Altise (base) starts at {{AUD|30,490}} and the Atara SL (top-end) is {{AUD|39,990}}. The hybrid model is expected to launch later on in 2012.

The Camry Hybrid received improvements, including a revised version of the [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]], paired with an Atkinson cycle version of the standard 2.5 [[Toyota AR engine#2AR-FXE|2AR-FXE]] liter 4-cylinder that delivers net system power of {{convert|200|bhp|kW|abbr=on|0|disp=flip}}, up from {{convert|187|bhp|kW|abbr=on|0|disp=flip}} in the previous model, and allows the new model to achieve a 39% increase in fuel economy rating,  giving the Camry Hybrid best MPG ratings among mid-size sedans.<ref name=GCC0812>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/08/camry-20110823.html |title=Toyota introduces 7th generation Camry for 2012 with improved fuel economy and performance across all models; ~39% jump in EPA city cycle fuel economy for the hybrid|publisher=Green Car Congress|date=2011-08-23|accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref><ref name=Abg0812>{{cite web|url=http://dev.sandbox.green.autoblog.com/2011/08/29/how-the-2012-toyota-camry-hybrid-differs-from-its-predecessor/|title=How the 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid differs from its predecessor |author=Eric Loveday|publisher=AutoblogGreen|date=2011-08-29|accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref> The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] rated the Camry Hybrid LE as:<ref name=EPAratingsCamry>{{cite web|url= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32092&id=32093&id=31765&id=31766 |title=Compare side-by-side: 2012 Toyota Camry|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]] and [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=2012-07-29}} ''The comparison shows fuel economy for the Camry Hybrid trims LE and XLE, and the gasoline-powered versions with 2.5L and 3.5L engines''.</ref>
