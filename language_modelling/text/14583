==Early life==
Berners-Lee was born in southwest London, England, on 8 June 1955,<ref name="W3Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html|title=Berners-Lee Longer Biography|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> one of four children born to [[Conway Berners-Lee]] and [[Mary Lee Woods]].

He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's independent [[Emanuel School]] from 1969 to 1973.<ref name=tecb/> A keen [[trainspotter]] as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b022ff6c-f673-11e1-9fff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25mg7CPq7 Lunch with the FT: Tim Berners-Lee - FT.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1973 to 1976, where he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class degree]] in physics.<ref name=W3Bio/>

==Career==
[[File:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|thumb|left|Berners-Lee, 2005]]
After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company [[Plessey]] in [[Poole]].<ref name=W3Bio/> In 1978, he joined D.G. Nash in [[Dorset]], where he helped create type-setting software for printers.<ref name=W3Bio/>

Berners-Lee worked as an [[independent contractor]] at [[CERN]] from June to December 1980. While there, he proposed a project based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Berners-Lee's original proposal to CERN|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|month=March|year=1989|url=http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> To demonstrate, he built a prototype system named [[ENQUIRE]].<ref name="linvinginternet">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Bill|title=Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and the World Wide Web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_lee.htm|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, England.<ref name="faq">{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=22 July 2010|author=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref> He ran the company's technical side for three years.<ref>{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Wendy|title=All you never knew about the Net ...|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 July 1996}}</ref> The project he worked on was a "[[real-time computing|real-time]] [[remote procedure call]]" which gave him experience in [[computer network]]ing.<ref name="faq" /> In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.<ref name="linvinginternet" />

In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:
{{quotation| "I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[domain name system]] ideas and<U+2014>ta-da!<U+2014>the World Wide Web<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|title=Answers for Young People|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref> ... Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/ber1int-1 |title=Biography and Video Interview of Timothy Berners-Lee at Academy of Achievement |publisher=Achievement.org |accessdate=21 December 2011}}</ref>}}

Berners-Lee wrote his initial proposal in March 1989, and in 1990, with the help of [[Robert Cailliau]] (with whom he shared the 1995 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Software System Award]]), produced a revision which was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the  Original Web Software|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Story/WelcomeStory.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first [[Web browser]]. His software also functioned as an editor (called [[WorldWideWeb]], running on the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system), and the first Web server, [[CERN HTTPd]] (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]).

{{quotation| " Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee]. Tim's prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers [[WYSIWYG]] browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in "surfing the Internet" are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology. Tim proposes "World-Wide Web". I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French..." by Robert Cailliau, 2 November 1995.<ref name="Ben">[http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 Roads and Crossroads of Internet History] Chapter 4: Birth of the Web</ref> }}

The first website built was at CERN within the border of France,<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Berners-Lee. Confirming The Exact Location Where the Web Was Invented|url=http://davidgalbraith.org/uncategorized/the-exact-location-where-the-web-was-invented/2343/}}</ref> and was first put online on 6 August 1991:

In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at MIT. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they could easily be adopted by anyone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent Policy<U+2014>5&nbsp;February&nbsp;2004|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/|accessdate=25 May 2008}}</ref>

In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in [[Colehill]] in [[Wimborne Minster|Wimborne]], [[East Dorset]], England.<ref>John W.

In December 2004, he accepted a chair in Computer Science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, [[University of Southampton]], England, to work on the [[Semantic Web]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web inventor, to join ECS| publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date= 2 December 2004| url = http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/658| accessdate=25 May 2008  }}</ref>

In a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that [[URI scheme#Generic syntax|the initial pair of slashes]] ("//") in a web address were actually "unnecessary". He told the newspaper that he could easily have designed web addresses not to have the slashes. "There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time," he said in his lighthearted apology.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8306631.stm|title=Berners-Lee 'sorry' for slashes|publisher=BBC |date= 14 October 2009|accessdate=14 October 2009}}</ref>

Commenting on the opening up of [[Ordnance Survey]] data in April 2010 Berners-Lee said that: "The changes signal a wider cultural change in Government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to<U+2014>not the other way around." He went on to say "Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them."<ref>{{cite news| title = Ordnance Survey offers free data access |publisher=BBC News |date= 1 April 2010| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8597779.stm| accessdate=3 April 2009  }}</ref>

The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes [[Google]], [[Facebook]], [[Intel]] and [[Microsoft]]. The A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online.
