'''NOS Energy Drink''' is an [[energy drink]] sometimes distributed in a bottle designed to look like a NOS ([[Nitrous Oxide Systems]]) cartridge. It is produced by the [[High Performance Beverage Company]], a division of [[Coca-Cola]] company, and licensed by [[Holley Performance]], which owns the trademark. NOS is available in 8 and 16 oz. aluminum cans, 11 oz. and 22 oz. resealable bottle forms and as a 2-ounce "Powershot." The original version is flavored with juice, but other variants including "fruit punch" and "grape" are also available.  Like many other energy drinks, NOS contains high levels of [[taurine]], and [[caffeine]], but differs via its inclusion of large amounts [[L-carnitine]].  <ref>http://energyfanatics.com/2008/05/03/nos-energy-drink-review/</ref>

==Marketing==
The drink is named after a brand of [[nitrous]] (nitrous oxide) used to boost cars in performance and during races; it is very common to see the name featured on cars in their commercials. The site also sponsors a mini video section that features consumers doing crazy stunts and other odd things. A "Rate Your Ride" feature is also established for amateur and professional drivers to showcase their cars.  Recently, NOS energy drink became the title sponsor for professional time attack and drag racer [[Chris Rado]] and Formula D professional drifter [[Chris Forsberg]] for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 season, and will also sponsor [[NASCAR]] drivers [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota Tundra in the [[Camping World Truck Series]]. Unfortunately, the deal fell through after the team failed to make the Daytona 500. It is also the official drink of Kyle Busch's #18 [[M&M's]] [[Toyota]] in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]]. NOS will sponsor [[Kyle Busch]]'s #18 Toyota Camry in the [[Nationwide Series]] in 2010.
