{{Campaignbox First Balkan War}}
The '''Battle of Bizani''' took place in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] on 4-6 March 1913. The battle was fought between the [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the last stages of the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the forts of Bizani, which covered the approaches to [[Ioannina]], the largest city in the region.

At the outbreak of the war, the Greek Army in the Epirus front did not have the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German-designed defensive positions in [[Bizani]]. However, after the campaign in Macedonia was over, a large part of the Army was redeployed to Epirus, where Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] himself assumed command. In the following battle the Ottoman positions were breached and Ioannina taken. The decisive factor for the Greek victory was not numerical superiority, but the solid operational planning that led to a well-coordinated and executed assault and did not allow the Ottoman forces to react.<ref name="Erickson304"/>

==Background==
{{See also|First Balkan War}}
As the main war effort of Greece was initially turned towards [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]],<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 234</ref> in the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered at the outbreak of hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander [[Esat Pasha (Ottoman general)|Esat Pasha]] at [[Battle of Gribovo|Gribovo]] however, the Greeks succeeded in conquering [[Preveza]] (21 October 1912) and pushing north to the direction of [[Ioannina]], repulsing an Ottoman attack at [[Battle of Pente Pigadia|Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar)]].<ref>Erickson (2003), pp. 228<U+2013>234</ref> On November 5, a small force from [[Corfu]] made a landing and captured the coastal area of [[Himar<U+00EB>]] without facing significant resistance,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?hl=el&id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&dq=epirus+4000&q=5+November&pgis=1#search_anchor Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization].

===Initial Greek attacks on Ioannina===
The terrain south of Ioannina provided excellent defensive ground, further reinforced with permanent fortifications, constructed under German supervision. These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements, bunkers, barbed wire, searchlights and machine gun positions. The Ioannina fortress area included two major fortresses, those of [[Bizani]] and [[Kastritsa]], guarding the main southern approaches, along with a number of smaller forts in a ring around the city, covering the western and northwestern approaches. The forts were well supplied with artillery, totalling some 102 pieces (most of them 87 mm).<ref>Hall (2000), pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref><ref>Erickson (2003), p. 227</ref> By December 1912, both sides were reinforced: the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army, retreating after the [[Battle of Monastir]], bringing their forces up to some 35,000, while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments, for a total of 25,000 men.<ref>Hall (2000), pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref> The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on 14 December. The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until 22 December, and even gained some ground, albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26,000 men.<ref>Erickson (2003), pp. 293<U+2013>298</ref> 

With operations in Macedonia having been completed, the Greek High Command now turned its attention to Epirus. Three divisions were transferred to the theater, raising the total of Greek troops to 28,000, along with 80 artillery pieces (amongst which twelve heavy 105 mm and 155 mm guns) and six aircraft.<ref name="Hall83"/><ref>Erickson (2003), pp. 299<U+2013>300</ref> Throughout the period, the siege continued actively, with artillery duels, attacks by Albanian irregulars on Greek supply lines, and reconnaissance and bombing missions on the city by the Greek airplanes.<ref name="Hall84">Hall (2000), p. 84</ref> At the same time, the hardships of the winter affected the morale of both sides.<ref name="Veremis">{{cite book | last1=Koliopoulos |first1=John S. | last2= Veremis |first2 = Thanos M. | title=Modern Greece: A History Since 1821 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=2009 | pages = 72-73 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=qumwwKbI0TQC | isbn=978-1405186810}}</ref> The Greek Epirus front commander, General [[Konstantinos Sapountzakis]], launched a new frontal attack on 20 January. Although it gained ground, pushing the defenders back into the fort of Bizani, the high casualty rate and the worsening weather resulted in the operation being suspended a few days later.<ref name="Hall84"/><ref>Erickson (2003), pp. 300<U+2013>301</ref>

==Battle of Bizani==
[[File:Greek_artillery_Bizani.JPG|thumb|Greek artillery firing against Bizani fort.]]
[[File:Greek_Evzones_in_Epirus_1913.jpg|thumb|[[Evzones]] near Ioannina after the battle.]]
After this renewed failure, Sapountzakis was relieved of his command and replaced by Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feint an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.<ref name="Hall84"/><ref>Erickson (2003), p. 301</ref>

The Greek artillery began firing a preparatory bombardment on March 4, continuing through the day. It is estimated that the Greeks fired 150 rounds per gun in this bombardment, while Ottoman counter-fire was hampered by lack of ammunition.<ref>Erickson (2003), pp. 301<U+2013>302</ref> The assault was launched on {{OldStyleDate|5 March|1912|20 February}}, by the 4th, 6th and 8th Infantry Divisions against the eastern and western sectors of the defensive perimeter. At the same time the Metsovon Joint Brigade launched a diversionary attack from the north.<ref name="Erickson303">Erickson (2003) p. 303</ref> The first Greek units, under heavy artillery support, breached the defensive line in Tsouka sector at morning, and during the following hours the Ottoman defenses were broken in five locations. As these breakthroughs from different axes threatened to collapse the entire defensive perimeter and to cut off his front echelons, Esat Pasha was forced to keep his reserve troops back and engage them in a defensive role.<ref name="Erickson303"/> By 18:00, the Greek 1st [[Evzones|Evzone]] regiment, together with the 9th Battalion of Major [[Ioannis Velissariou]], the village of Agios Ioannis on the southern outskirts of Ioannina.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?cd=1&hl=el&id=n4-RAAAAIAAJ&dq=battle+of+bizani&q=velissariou%2Bbizani#search_anchor A concise history of the Balkan Wars, 1912-1913.] Hellenic Army General Staff, Army History Directorate, 1998 ,ISBN 9789607897077 p. 196 </ref>

As a consequence of the Greek advance, the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16:00 and isolated from the rest of the Ottoman army and its headquarters in Ioannina. As night fell, the forts ceased firing, and their garrisons abandoned them, trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to Ioannina. Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning, although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender.<ref name="Erickson303-4">Erickson (2003), pp. 303<U+2013>304</ref> Meanwhile, Essat Pasha realized that the battle was lost, and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he could to the north. As the Greeks pressed their advance however, he contacted the city's foreign consulates to seek help in negotiating a surrender. At 23:00 on {{OldStyleDate|6 March|1912|21 February}} he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of [[Ioannina]] and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks.<ref name="Erickson303-4"/> The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag-covered streets of the city.<ref name="Veremis"/>

===Aerial warfare===
The Greek forces used a small fleet of aircraft, that mainly consisted of [[Farman MF.7|Maurice Farman MF.7]] biplanes, during the operations. They used an airfield near [[Nicopolis]] and performed several reconnaissance and bombing missions with considerable effect. Among the aviators were the notable Greek pilots [[Dimitrios Kamperos]] and [[Michael Moutoussis]].<ref>{{cite web

==Aftermath==
During the battle, the Greek army inflicted some 2,800 Ottoman casualties, losing only 284 of its own. The Greeks captured some 8,600 prisoners, while the remainder of the Ottoman garrison was able to retreat into Albania. The Greeks also captured 108 artillery pieces and large amounts of mat<U+00E9>riel.<ref name="Erickson304"/> On {{OldStyleDate|March 16|1913|March 3}}, the Greek forces entered [[Gjirokaster]], [[Delvine]] and the next day [[Tepelene]],<ref name="Veremis"/> at the end of the war they reached a line that stretched from the [[Ceraunian mountains]] (above [[Himar<U+00EB>]]) in the Ionian coast to Lake [[Prespa]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web| last = Schurman | first = Jacob Gould| title = The Balkan Wars: 1912-1913 | publisher = Project Gutenberg | year = 1916 | location = | page = | ref=Schurman | isbn = | url= ftp://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/1/6/7/11676/11676.txt}}</ref> The success in the Epirus front enabled the Greek headquarters to transfer part of the army to [[Thessaloniki]], in preparation for a confrontation against the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarians]].<ref name="Hall85"/>

==Legacy==
Given the strongly entrenched opposition it faced, the historian Richard Hall cites the battle of Bizani and the fall of Ioannina as the greatest military effort of the Greek army in the First Balkan War.<ref name="Hall85">Hall (2000), p. 85</ref> Decisive factor for the Greek victory was not the numerical superiority of the Greek Army during the final assault, but the solid planning of the operations, that lead to a well coordinated and executed assault and left no choice to the Ottoman side to react in time.<ref name=Erickson304>Erickson (2003), p. 304</ref> The surrender of [[Ioannina]] secured Greek control of southern Epirus and the Ionian coast, whilst denying it to the newly-formed Albanian state, for which it might have provided a southern anchor-point comparable to [[Shkod<U+00EB>r]] in the north.<ref>Hall (2000), p. 95</ref>

Moreover, groups consisting of local women supported the operations of the Greek Army in several ways: transportation of guns, food, clothes and other important supplies. On specific occasions women also participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces.<ref>{{cite web  | author=Mpalaska Eleni, Oikonomou Andrian , Stylios Chrysostomos  | title=Women of Epirus and their social status from ancient to modern times  | format=PDF  | url=http://www.womanway.eu/studies/files/social_teiep_en.pdf  | accessdate=2010-05-16  | pages=22-23  |work=Community Initiative Programme.
