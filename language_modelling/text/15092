Throughout human history, fungi have been utilized as a source of food and harnessed to ferment and preserve foods and beverages. In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, humans have learned to harness fungi to protect human health ([[antibiotics]], anti-cholesterol statins, and immunosuppressive agents), while industry has utilized fungi for large scale production of [[enzymes]], [[acids]], and [[biosurfactants]].<ref name ="Ref1">{{cite book| title = Microbial enzymes and biotransformations| editor = Barredo JL| chapter = Microbial cells and enzymes| year = 2005| pages = 1<U+2013>10| isbn = 1-58829-253-3}}</ref> With the advent of modern [[nanotechnology]] in the 1980s, fungi have remained important by providing a greener alternative to chemically synthesized nanoparticle.<ref name=Ref2>{{cite journal|last=Ghorbani|first=HR|coauthors=Safekordi AA, Attar H, Rezayat Sorkhabadi SM|title=Biological and non-biological methods for silver nanoparticles synthesis|journal=Chemical and Biochemical Engineering Quarterly|year=2011|volume=25|pages=317<U+2013>326}}</ref>

== Miscellaneous nanoparticle production ==

In addition to gold and silver, ''Fusarium oxysporum'' has been used to synthesize zirconia, titanium, cadmium sulfide and cadmium selenide nanosize particles. Cadmium sulfide nanoparticles have also been synthesized by ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', and ''Candida glabrata''.<ref name=Ref20>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=X|coauthors=Xu H, Chen Z, Chen G|title=Biosynthesis of nanoparticles by microorganisms and their applications|journal=Journal of Nanomaterials|year=2011}}</ref>

== Culture techniques and conditions ==

Culture techniques and media vary depending upon the requirements of the fungal isolate involved, however the general procedure consist of the following: fungal [[hyphae]] are typically placed in liquid growth media and placed in shake culture until the fungal culture has increased in biomass. The fungal hyphae are removed from the growth media, washed with distilled water to remove the growth media, placed in distilled water and incubated on shake culture for 24 to 48 hours. The fungal hyphae are separated from the [[supernatant]], and an aliquot of the supernatant is added to 1.0 mM ion solution. The ion solution is then monitored for 2 to 3 days for the formation of nanoparticles. Another common culture technique is to add washed fungal hyphae directly into 1.0 mM ion solution instead of utilizing the fungal filtrate. [[Silver nitrate]] is the most widely used source of silver ions, but [[silver sulfate]] has also been utilized.<ref name=Ref10 /> Choloroauric acid is generally used as the source of gold ions at various concentrations (1.0 mM<ref name=Ref14 /> and 250&nbsp;mg to 500&nbsp;mg<ref name=Ref18 /> of Au per liter). [[Cadmium sulfide]] nanoparticle synthesis for ''F. oxysporum'' was conducted using a 1:1 ratio of Cd<sup>2+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> at a 1 mM concentration.<ref name=Ref21>{{cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=A|coauthors=Mukherjee P, Mandal D, Senapati S, Khan M, Kumar R, Sastry M|title=Enzyme mediated extracellular synthesis of CdS nanoparticles by the fungus, ''Fusarium oxysporum''|journal=Journal of  American Chemical Society|year=2002|volume=124|pages=12108<U+2013>12109}}</ref> Gold nanoparticles can vary in shape and size depending on the [[pH]] of the ion solution.<ref name=Ref18 /> Gericke and Pitches (2006) reported that for ''V. luteoalbum'' small (cc.10&nbsp;nm) spherical gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 3, larger (spherical, triangular, hexagon and rods) gold nanoparticles are formed at pH 5, and at pH 7 to pH 9 the large nanoparticles tend to lack a defined shape. Soni and Prakash (2011) reported an opposite response to pH for silver nanoparticles synthesized by both ''C. tropicum'' and ''F. oxysporum''.<ref name=Ref22>{{cite journal|last=Soni|first=N|coauthors=Prakash S|title=Factors affecting the geometry of silver nanoparticles sythesis in ''Chrysosporium tropicum'' and ''Fusarium oxysporum''|journal=American Journal of Nanotechnology|year=2011|volume=2|issue=1|pages=112<U+2013>121}}</ref>  The authors concluded that silver nanoparticle size increased as the pH of the ion solution decreased. Temperature interactions for both silver and gold nanoparticles were similar; a lower temperature resulted in smaller nanoparticle while higher temperatures produced larger nanoparticles.<ref name=Ref18 /><ref name=Ref22 />

== Analytical techniques ==

=== Visual observations ===

For externally synthesized silver nanoparticles the silver ion solution generally becomes brownish in color,<ref name=Ref7 /><ref name=Ref8 /><ref name=Ref9 /> but this browning reaction may be absent.<ref name=Ref10 /> For fungi that synthesize intracellular silver nanoparticles, the hyphae darken to a brownish color while the solution remains clear. In both cases the browning reaction is attributed to the surface [[plasmon resonance]] of the metallic nanoparticles.<ref name=Ref6 /><ref name=Ref23>{{cite journal|last=Shankar|first=S|coauthors=Ahmad A, Sastry M|title=Geranium leaf assisted biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles|journal=Biotechnol Prog|year=2003|volume=19|pages=1627<U+2013>1631}}</ref> For external gold nanoparticle production, the solution color can vary depending on the size of the gold nanoparticles; smaller particles appear pink while large particles appear purple. Intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis typically turns the hyphae purple while the solution remains clear. Externally synthesized cadmium sulfide nanoparticles were reported to make the solution color appear bright yellow.<ref name=Ref21/>

=== Analytical tools ===

Scanning electron microscopy ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]), transmission electron microscopy ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]), energy dispersive analysis of X-ray ([[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]]), [[UV-vis spectroscopy]], and [[X-ray diffraction]] are used to characterize different aspects of nanoparticles. Both SEM and TEM can be used to visualize the location, size, and morphology of the nanoparticles, while UV-vis spectroscopy can be used to confirm the metallic nature, size and aggregation level. Energy dispersive analysis of X-ray is used to determine elemental composition, and X-ray diffraction is used to determine chemical composition and crystallographic structure. UV-Vis absorption peaks for silver, gold, and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles can vary depending on particle size: 25-50&nbsp;nm silver particles peak ca. 415&nbsp;nm, gold nanoparticles 30-40&nbsp;nm peak ca. 450&nbsp;nm, while a cadmium sulfide absorption edge ca. 450 is indicative of quantum size particles.<ref name=Ref21 /> Larger nanoparticle of each type will have UV-Vis absorption peaks or edges that shift to longer wavelengths while smaller nanoparticles will have UV-Vis absorption peaks or edges that shift to shorter wavelengths.

== Formation mechanisms ==

=== Gold and silver ===

[[File:SEM image of fungal derived silvernanoparticles.tif|300x300px|thumbnail|right|SEM image of fungal derived silver nanoparticles stabilized by a capping agent.]]
Nitrate reductase was suggested to initiate nanoparticle formation by many fungi including ''Penicillium'' species, while several enzymes, <U+03B1>-NADPH-dependent reductases, nitrate-dependent reductases and an extracellular shuttle quinone, were implicated in silver nanoparticle synthesis for ''Fusarium oxysporum''. Jain et al. (2011) indicated that silver nanoparticle synthesis for ''A. flavus'' occurs initially by a "33kDa" protein followed by a protein (cystein and free amine groups) [[electrostatic attraction]] which stabilizes the nanoparticle by forming a capping agent.<ref name=Ref24>{{cite journal|last=Jain|first=N|coauthors=Jain, N., Bhargava A, Majumdar S, Tarafdar J, Panwar J|title=Extracellular biosynthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles using ''Aspergillus flavus'' NJP08: a mechanism perspective|journal=Nanoscale|year=2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=635<U+2013>641}}</ref> Intracellular silver and gold nanoparticle synthesis is not fully understood but similar fungal cell wall surface electrostatic attraction, reduction, and accumulation has been proposed.<ref name=Ref21 /> External gold nanoparticle synthesis by ''P. chrysosporium'' was attributed to [[laccase]], while intracellular gold nanoparticle synthesis was attributed to [[ligninase]].<ref name=Ref21 />

=== Cadmium sulfide ===

Cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis by yeast involves sequestration of Cd<sup>2+</sup> by glutathione-related peptides followed by reduction within the cell. Ahmad et al. (2002) reported that cadmium sulfide nanoparticle synthesis by ''Fusarium oxysporum'' was based on a sulfate reductase (enzyme) process.
