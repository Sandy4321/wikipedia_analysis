'''Strawberry Shortcake''' is a [[Licensing#Artwork and character licensing|licensed character]] owned by [[American Greetings]], originally used in [[greeting card]]s and expanded to include [[doll]]s, [[poster]]s, and other products. The Strawberry Shortcake properties also include a toy line of the character's friends and pets. 

==History==
The original design of Strawberry Shortcake and her [[cat]], [[Custard (disambiguation)|Custard]] was done in 1977 by [[Muriel Fahrion]] during her time as a greeting card illustrator at American Greetings' Juvenile & Humorous card department.<ref name=fahrion>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/1386286081.html?dids=1386286081:1386286081&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+16%2C+2007&author=JUDY+SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=Vacuous+like+cotton+candy&pqatl=google|last=Siegel-Itzkovich|first=Judy|title=Vacuous like cotton candy|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2010-08-05|format=Registration required to read article|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|page=38}}</ref> After the idea was presented to Bernie Loomis of [[General Mills]] and became a licensing entity,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Fahrion designed a subsequent the 32 characters for Those Characters From Cleveland (American Greetings' toy & licensing design division).<ref name=fahrion/>

Cindy Mayer Patton and Janet Jones designed the other later characters of the classic Strawberry Shortcake line. Lynn Edwards was the editor of the line and developed the personality profiles and the story line and philosophy. The first doll was a rag doll designed by Muriel Fahrion and created by Susan Trentel, Fahrion's sister.


The Strawberry Shortcake line of characters each had their own fruit or dessert-themed name with clothing to match, and they each had a dessert- or fruit-named pet. Like the Strawberry Shortcake doll, all the other characters' dolls had hair scented to match their dessert theme. The characters lived and played in a magical world known as Strawberryland.

During the 1980s, Strawberry Shortcake became a huge [[fad]] for young girls throughout the United States. At the time, there were many related products, such as [[sticker]] albums, clothing, a [[video game]] by [[Parker Bros.]] entitled ''Strawberry Shortcake Musical Match-Ups'' for the [[Atari 2600]] [http://www.mobygames.com/game/atari-2600/strawberry-shortcake-musical-match-ups], and numerous other products. Several TV specials were made featuring the characters, one each year between 1980 and 1985, when the fad had waned. [[Kenner]] produced no new dolls or toys thereafter.

In 1991, [[THQ]] tried reviving                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            the franchise by producing an updated line of Strawberry Shortcake dolls. Strawberry and five of her classic friends each got a makeover with new clothes, hair, and eyes. However, the line enjoyed at best a modest success, lasting just the one year.

In 2002, the franchise was revived again, this time with a revamped look by a different designer. Many strong licensing deals were made. A television series with new [[DVD]]s and [[VHS]]s (and in some markets, particularly those in Asia, [[Video CD]]s) were released. Soundtracks for the episodes were also released on [[CD]] at various intervals. [[DiC]] Entertainment was granted rights for producing the TV series. The company sub-licensed the production of videos, [[DVD]]s and Video CDs of the Strawberry Shortcake series to [[20th Century Fox]] Home Videos. 20th Century Fox subsequently licensed the production of these videos outside of the U.S. to various other licensees. 

[[Bandai]] (along with KellyToy) was granted the manufacturing rights of the Strawberry Shortcake dolls and toys. For the first time in almost two decades, new videogames were launched, produced by [[The Game Factory]] for Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. Educational [[CD-ROM]]s for the [[Personal computer|PC]] were also produced.

In 2006, [[Playmates Toys]] picked up the rights to manufacture and sell Strawberry Shortcake figurines. The line they produced was named "A World of Friends" and the doll "Frosty Puff" debuted in this new product line.  Although a good deal of shuffling and redistribution took place concerning the pets of the re-launched Strawberry Shortcake characters, very few of the new dolls were actually merchandised with their respective pets. 

A full-length feature film, [[Strawberry Shortcake: The Sweet Dreams Movie]], premiered in 2006 and was released on VHS in February 2007.

The Playmates' new product line was met with mixed reactions from the series' fans (see Criticisms section below); however, the line's public reception was generally negative. As a result, Playmates Toys lost the manufacturing rights to [[Hasbro]], who will be releasing new Strawberry Shortcake themed toys beginning in the fall of 2009, after [[American Greetings]] reboots the franchise once again.<ref name="2009ssc">[http://www.agpbrands.com/files/news/finalssc32.doc AG Properties Press Release announcing the change of licensor]</ref>

==1980s==
===Friends===
{{main|List of 1980s Strawberry Shortcake characters}}


There is a bit of "wiggle room" in a few cases, between the introduction of a character, and their release as a toy. For instance, Raspberry Tart (the character) was introduced in 1980, with the first Strawberry Shortcake TV Special, alongside Huckleberry Pie, Apple Dumplin', etc., but was not released as a Doll until the next year. The same is true of Strawberry Shortcake's nemesis, [[List of Strawberry Shortcake villains|The Peculiar Purple Pie Man]]. Plum Puddin' also debuted in 1980, but would not get a doll until 1984, by which time the character had switched genders, and was now a girl. Moreover, with the exception of Apple Dumplin', Apricot, and The Purple Pie Man, none of the other characters would come packaged with pets (nor would most of them even be known to have pets) until the 1982 releases, when all the earlier-released characters were re-issued with their animal friends. A couple of the characters weren't produced as dolls at all, namely T.N. Honey, Raisin Cane, and Baby Needs-a-Name, who was only made as a larger-sized "Blow-Kiss" baby doll. Raisin Cane was introduced as the niece of villainess Sour Grapes in Issue #1 of [[Star Comics]]' (an imprint of [[Marvel Comics]]) short-lived Strawberry Shortcake Comic Book, and, as far as is known, was never considered for any kind of commercial merchandising.

===1980s television specials===
{{main|Strawberry Shortcake (80s Annual Specials)}}

From 1980 through 1985, annual specials featuring Strawberry Shortcake were produced. Like many other cartoons produced in the 1980s that were based on characters from toy lines, they were produced primarily to sell toys.

The 1980 and 1982 specials were animated by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson and Toei Doga, while the 1983 special through the final special 1985 were animated by Nelvana, The 1981 special was a unique case, animated by Perpetual Motion Pictures of New York.

==2003 relaunch==
[[Image:K-strawberry234.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A 2003 Strawberry Shortcake poster called "Berry Best Friends" featuring Strawberry with Angel Cake (left) and Ginger Snap (right)]]

===Characters with their pets and homes===
{{main|List of 2003 Strawberry Shortcake characters}}
{{main|List of Strawberry Shortcake villains}}
A little revamping took place at the characters' relaunch. Both Pupcake and Custard now belong to Strawberry Shortcake. In Pupcake's place, a new pet, Shoofly Frog, was introduced as Huckleberry Pie's pet, and Apple Dumplin' was relaunched as Strawberry Shortcake's sister. Also, Strawberryland is now divided into "districts" like Cakewalk, Orange Blossom Acres, Huckleberry Briar and Cookie Corners.

===Strawberryland Fillies===
{{main|List of Animal Characters in the 2003 Strawberry Shortcake universe#fillies}}
The 2003 revival of the franchise introduced fillies to the franchise. Each of the fillies are tied down to a character, with the main filly, Honey Pie Pony, being the only one able to talk and have a pet. However, when Playmates took over the dolls rights from Bandai, they decided to scrap the existing fillies and introduce new ones. However, the removal has not spread beyond the scope of the toy line.

===2003 TV series===
{{main|Strawberry Shortcake (2003 TV series)}}

In 2003, the Strawberry Shortcake franchise was revived, and with it, a Strawberry Shortcake TV series was finally produced, 19 years after the last special. The series reflected the changes in the direction of the franchise, and has the primary focus on being an educational program.

The series is produced by DiC Entertainment and 20th Century Fox.

===Theatrically released feature film===
{{main|Strawberry Shortcake: The Sweet Dreams Movie}}
In October 2006, the first Strawberry Shortcake film, ''[[Strawberry Shortcake: The Sweet Dreams Movie|The Sweet Dreams Movie]]'', was released in select cities by Kidtoon Films. The Peculiar Purple Pie-Man of Porcupine Peak and Sour Grapes, which were notably absent from the TV series, are re-introduced in the movie. However, Sour Grapes is re-introduced as Purple Pieman's sister in materials related to the Sweet Dreams Movie. The movie was released on DVD on February 6, 2007, and has also been aired on networks and released on DVD and VideoCDs worldwide.

==Soundtracks==
{{main|List of Strawberry Shortcake CDs}}

To date, 8 CDs have been released by Koch records since the franchise's revival in 2003. These CDs are soundtrack CDs containing music from the TV series and DVDs, as well as one for the movie. Additionally, a CD was released along with a piano book.

==2009 relaunch==
[[File:StrawberryShortcake2009.jpg|thumb]]
{{main|List of 2009 Strawberry Shortcake characters}}
In June 2008, American Greetings announced that Hasbro has won the license from Playmates, and with it they will relaunch the series again. The extensive relaunch involves numerous large redesigns and a reboot of the franchise's universe. The relaunch began in Summer 2009 (originally planned for Fall 2009, but pushed forward in a recent announcement), with the release of a CGI movie, ''The Sky's the Limit'', with [[Anna Cummer]] voicing Strawberry Shortcake. This will be followed by a 26 episode TV series. However, the announcement has gained some criticism (see Criticisms section below). 

Merchandise of the 2009 relaunch began appearing in mid-2009.

As of December 2009, the main 6 characters of the show are Strawberry Shortcake, Lemon Meringue, Orange Blossom, Raspberry Torte, Plum Pudding and Blueberry Muffin. Recently, a 7th girl was added: Cherry Jam. 

According to American Greetings, the 2003 franchise' run will end in spring 2009 where toys are concerned, but DVDs containing the older designs will continue to be released until late 2010/early 2011.

==Video games==
{{main|List of Strawberry Shortcake video games}}

The first Strawberry Shortcake videogame was produced in 1983. It was designed for children, and thus the software was kept as simple as possible, with very simple graphics and sounds (the abilities of the Atari 2600 console were very limited). No further games based upon the franchise were produced until 20 years later, in 2003, with Strawberry Shortcake: Amazing Cookie Party, for the PC. Since then, games have been published for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, Sony PlayStation 2, PCs and Apple Macintoshes, and even a standalone game console based on Konami's Dance Dance Revolution franchise.

==Criticisms==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2008}}

===General inconsistencies===

Over time, several characters' names and relationships were changed. Raspberry Tart's name was changed to Raspberry Torte, for instance, and Pupcake became Strawberry's pet instead of Huck's.<ref name="petsRe">DiC Entertainment/20th Century Fox, Meet Strawberry Shortcake, DVD, 2003</ref>

===Playmates' acquisition of the licenses===
In 2006, Bandai lost the rights of the franchise to Playmates. Upon acquiring the license, Playmates started making changes to the directions of the franchise.

''Availability'' - Fans have noticed that since Playmates' acquisition of license to the franchise, merchandise has become scarce, especially in regions outside North America. 

''Scents'' - Playmates' introduction of the 2006 toy line is very loose with the linked scents that have been traditional in this franchise. Examples include cherry used for Crepes Suzette and Grape used for Tea Blossom.

''Fillies/Ponies'' - In early 2007, Playmates introduced three new ponies, but these are different from the previous Strawberryland Fillies. The ponies belong to Strawberry Shortcake, Angel Cake, and Crepes Suzette, and are aligned with the Berries to Blossoms doll line. The Honey Pie Pony and Milkshake names are not used and neither pony looks like the fillies previously linked to Strawberry and Angel. The new ponies are not given names of their own.

===The TV show and the movie===
There is a continuity error between ''Meet Strawberry Shortcake'' and ''Here Comes Pupcake'', with the former indicating that Strawberry Shortcake had not met the other residents of Strawberryland when she already had Pupcake for a while, while the latter indicates that she has known the other residents of Strawberryland even before she acquired Pupcake.<ref name="loopError">[http://www.tv.com/strawberry-shortcake/here-comes-pupcake/episode/351614/trivia.html Tv.com guide detailing the glitch]</ref>

Also, the versions of the first four episodes broadcast on North American TV were edited down to 22 minutes in length. This resulted in the removal of certain subplots and songs from the broadcast edition of these episodes. This edited version was also used in the Game Boy Advance Video release of the episodes. However, the DVD and VHS releases contain the original 44-minute versions of the episodes. In other markets these first four episodes were aired as two-parters, adding an extra four episodes to the episode count.<ref name="edited">[http://www.tv.com/strawberry-shortcake/get-well-adventure/episode/351618/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;2 TV.com details on one of the edited episodes]</ref>

Some episodes were also released under different names in different regions. For example, "A Trip to Pearis, France" was released under the title "The Friendship Club" on Disney Channel Asia and on Video CDs and DVDs released in Asia. This was repeated for "The Great Friendship Festival", "Dancing in Disguise", and "Meet Apricot", which was released as "A Festival of Friends", "Everybody Dance" and "Let's Dance" respectively in the Asian region.<ref name="cmp">Compared Tv.com guides to Disney Channel Asia's online guides</ref>

====2003 episodes Series 4 changes====
With the transition to the new design for Series 4 of the show beginning in 2008 with Big Country Fun, new criticisms arose about various aspects and changes made upon transition from 2003 Season 1-3 to 2003 Series 4.

American Greetings' design team changed Blueberry Muffin's hair color from blue to brown for the 2000s series, but reinstated her blue hair in phases beginning in 2006 (starting with the Playmates dolls, followed by books, and finally on to various media in 2008).

Also, beginning with ''It Takes Talent'' and ''Playing to Beat the Band'', the characters now have an "all new look" which is more consistent with the current official artwork and toyline. 

The continuity of "Everybody Dance aka Dancin' In Disguise" in "Let's Dance" was discarded in Big Country Fun as Sour Grapes will be reverted back into a villain.<ref name="bcfDgrd">DiC Entertainment/20th Century Fox, Big Country Fun, DVD, 2008</ref>

Finally, there recently arose reports (as of February 2008) that Honey Pie and the other fillies have been scrapped and will no longer be featured in the fourth season of the 2000s TV series, probably a move to synchronize the show with the Playmates dolls (which does not associate Honey Pie or any of the current fillies with the dolls or franchise, but instead a new generic, nameless set of fillies).

===The 2009 Relaunch===
Ever since  June 2008, Hasbro has been named the new Master Toy Licensee for Strawberry Shortcake. Credible sources state that American Greetings plans to end the current franchise in Spring 2009, and wait six months before relaunching the series in Fall 2009. However, it has plans to stretch the current DVD releases until late 2010/early 2011, allowing the current DVD franchise to run along DVDs featuring the new redesigned characters (a similar tactic is also currently being employed by American Greetings to market Care Bears DVDs containing the older Nelvana/DiC animation series).

Undergoing another continuity reboot, the 2009 Hasbro-era Strawberry Shortcake re-visits some elements of the classic '80s/'90s lines, but combine them in all-new ways for the 21st century. The cast list has been streamlined to include Strawberry Shortcake, Strawberry's cat Custard, and her friends Blueberry Muffin, Raspberry Torte, Plum Pudding, Orange Blossom and Lemon Meringue, all characters from the themes first two years.
The girls have been reduced in size (again evoking an '80s sensibility in regard to scale) to the point where they can ride on the back of a bluebird, and balance on the tops of daisies. Instead of Strawberryland, the girls live and work in Berry Bitty City, a tiny village located in a berry patch, where they are aided in their daily tasks by helpful little beings called Berrykins (which bear no resemblance to the mid-'80s Berrykins).

==Controversy==
===American McGee's Strawberry Shortcake===
In 2003, webcomic ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]]'' posted an "advertisement" for an imaginary computer game, ''[[Penny Arcade (webcomic)#American Greetings|American McGee's Strawberry Shortcake]]'', in reference to ''[[American McGee's Alice]]'' - a twisted and violent take on [[Lewis Carroll]]'s works. American Greetings took offense to the parody and issued a [[cease-and-desist]] letter, to which the authors begrudgingly complied<ref name="passAlice">[http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/04/14 Penny Arcade! - Tart As A Double Entendre<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> - but not without making their indignation very clear.<ref name="AGnazi">[http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/04/28 Penny Arcade! - Read It Before They Take Legal Action]</ref>

Some argue that Penny Arcade's case was not covered under the [[fair use]] doctrine because the use of the characters in this case was for [[satire]];<ref name="satire">[http://www.penny-arcade.com/2003/04/21 Penny Arcade! - Blog, 21st April 2003]</ref> they claim that fair use only protects the unauthorized use of copyrighted characters in [[parody|parodies]] of the original material, and that satire and parody are totally different concepts. Others, however, take the view that parody and satire are equally protected by law.<ref name="satire2">[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/speech/Arts/topic.aspx?topic=parody_satire firstamendmentcenter.org: Arts & First Amendment in Speech]</ref>

Ironically, Penny Arcade did not intend to offend American Greetings in the comic, but instead intended to mock [[American McGee]] and [[Mcfarlane Toys]], who collaborated to create a toy line based on a twisted version of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The poster also mocked American McGee's game, [[American McGee's Alice]], a game with a dark and twisted take on Lewis Carroll's books, [[Alice In Wonderland]] and [[Through the Looking Glass]]. 

Various other TV shows, including [[Drawn Together]],<ref name="dtbigtwist">[[The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II|Drawn Together: The One Wherein There's A Big Twist (Part 2)]]</ref> [[Robot Chicken]],<ref name="berryrude">[[Operation: Rich In Spirit (Robot Chicken episode)#Berry_Rude|The ''Berry Rude'' skit in the Robot Chicken episode ''Operation: Rich In Spirit'']]</ref><ref name="revenge">[[Moesha Poppins|The ''Girl Toys'' skit in the Robot Chicken episode ''Moesha Poppins'']]</ref><ref name="titleParody">[[Squaw Bury Shortcake|Robot Chicken episode title ''Squaw Bury Shortcake'']]</ref> and [[South Park]]<ref name="Imaginationland">[[Imaginationland Episode II|South Park episode: Imaginationland (Part 2)]]</ref> have since also parodied or satirized Strawberry Shortcake in various ways but at this time have met no reported retaliation from American Greetings.

===Cookie Jar's acquisition===
On June 20, 2008, Cookie Jar Entertainment announced its intention to merge with DiC Entertainment,<ref name="dic_merger">[http://www.cookiejarentertainment.com/news2.php?id=127 Cookie Jar Entertainment announcement of the intention of merger with DiC]</ref> who holds the rights to the Strawberry Shortcake animated series. The merger was completed on July 23, 2008.<ref name="dic_merger_2">[http://www.cookiejarentertainment.com/news2.php?id=130 Announcement of the closure of the merger]</ref> On the same day as the finalization of the merger, Cookie Jar Entertainment announced further intentions to acquire the Strawberry Shortcake and Care Bears franchise from American Greetings itself.<ref name="sscbuy">[http://www.cookiejarentertainment.com/news2.php?id=129 Cookie Jar Entertainment's announcement of the intention to buy the franchise off American Greetings]</ref> The deal was expected to finalize on September 30, 2008. However, up until April 2009, there was no further word on the status of the acquisition. 

In March 2009, it was announced that Cookie Jar delayed the acquisition back in December 2008 due to difficulty in financing the acquisition. It was also revealed that Cookie Jar offered US$195 million for the franchise. And due to the situation, American Greetings has put the franchise back on sale. It was also announced that a French company called MoonScoop has expressed interest and offered US$95 million for the franchise, US$100 million less than what was offered by Cookie Jar. Cookie Jar has announced intentions to compete against MoonScoop's bid, however. Cookie Jar had until end of April 2009 to counter MoonScoop's bid.<ref name="2009sscbuyfup1">[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D978L0080.htm Deal for Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears revived - BusinessWeek]</ref>. 

This has led to various currently ongoing lawsuits between Cookie Jar, American Greetings and MoonScoop. However, MoonScoop is given ownership of the franchise while the lawsuits proceed.
