'''SMS ''Freya''''' was a [[protected cruiser]] of the [[Victoria Louise class protected cruiser|''Victoria Louise'' class]], built for the German [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine'') in the 1890s, along with her [[sister ship]]s {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}}, {{SMS|Hertha||2}}, {{SMS|Vineta|1897|2}}, and {{SMS|Hansa|1898|2}}. ''Freya'' was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1895, launched in April 1897, and commissioned into the Navy in October 1898. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21&nbsp;cm guns and eight 15&nbsp;cm guns and had a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. 

''Freya'' served in the German fleet for the initial years of her career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a modernization in 1905&ndash;1907, ''Freya'' was used as a [[school ship]] for cadets. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''Freya'' was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a [[barracks ship]] after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921.

''Freya'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Freya|1874|2}}" and was laid down at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Danzig|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Danzig]] in 1895.<ref name=G47>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 47</ref> She was launched on 27 April 1897, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the German navy on 20 October 1898.<ref name=G48>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 48</ref> The ship was {{convert|110.6|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.4|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.58|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|6491|MT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of three vertical 4-cylinder  [[triple expansion engine]]s powered by twelve coal-fired [[Belleville boiler]]s. Her engines provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|3412|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}. She had a crew of 31&nbsp;officers and 446&nbsp;enlisted men.<ref name=G478>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 47&ndash;48</ref>

The ship was armed with two [[21 cm SK L/40 gun|21&nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns in single turrets, one forward and one aft. The guns were supplied with supplied with 58&nbsp;rounds of ammunition each. They had a range of {{convert|16300|m|abbr=on}}. ''Vineta'' also carried eight [[15 cm SK L/40|15&nbsp;cm SK L/40]] guns.

==Service history==
After her commissioning, ''Freya'' served with the German fleet.<ref name=G48/> On 1 September 1902, ''Freya'' joined the Cruiser Division of the I Squadron of the German home fleet. The Division consisted of the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}, the [[flagship]], {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}}, and the light cruisers {{SMS|Hela||2}}, {{SMS|Amazone|1900|2}}, and {{SMS|Niobe||2}}. The Division participated in the summer fleet maneuvers of August&ndash;September 1902.<ref>Brassey, p. 155</ref> In 1905, ''Freya'' went into drydock at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Imperial Dockyard]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]] for modernization. During the refit she was re-boilered; she had been built originally with three stacks, and during the modernization they were trunked into two funnels. The refit was finished in 1907, after which ''Freya'' was used as a [[school ship|training ship]] for naval cadets.<ref name=G478/> 

In 1907, [[G<U+00FC>nther L<U+00FC>tjens]] served aboard the ship as a cadet; L<U+00FC>tjens went on to command the task force composed of [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen'']] in World War II.<ref>von M<U+00FC>llenheim-Rechberg, p. 63</ref> In August 1908, ''Freya'' represented Germany at celebrations in [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Canada, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the Canadian Parliament.<ref>Colby, p. 514</ref> While entering the port at around midnight on 9 August, she inadvertently rammed a [[schooner]] in heavy fog. Nine sailors were killed in the accident.<ref>Hadley & Sarty, p. 49</ref>

''Freya'' had a short career during [[World War I]]. At the outbreak of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the [[Baltic Sea]]. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service.<ref name=GG142>Gardiner & Gray, p. 142</ref> She was then put into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and returned to service as a training ship based in [[Flensburg]]. She served in this capacity through to the end of the war.<ref name=G48/> In 1915, [[Bernhard Rogge]], who would go on to command the raider [[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|''Atlantis'']] during World War II, served aboard the ship as a cadet.<ref>Slavick, p. 2</ref> She was stricken on 25 January 1920 and used briefly as a [[barracks ship]] for police in [[Hamburg]]. She was ultimately broken up for scrap in [[Harburg]] in 1921.<ref name=G48/>
