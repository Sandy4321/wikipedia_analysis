'''''Madonna''''' is a biography by American author [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], chronicling the life of American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. The book was released in November 2001 by [[St. Martin's Press]] in the United States and in April 2002 by [[Michael O'Mara Books]] in the United Kingdom. Morton decided to write a biography on Madonna in 2000. The release was announced in April 2001 by St. Martin's Press. President and publisher Sally Richardson described the biography to contain details about Madonna's ambitions, her relationships and her lifestyle.

Morton interviewed about 70 people who had known Madonna since her youth. He had to spend a lot of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people &mdash; including artists, musicians, and directors &mdash; who had an interesting perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, ''Madonna'' received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The book was a commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on  [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], and sold half of its initial print.

Madonna herself was critical of Morton writing a biography on her life, and sent a letter to him, asking him to stay away from her family and friends. Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of his interest in the star, not least because she has made a "difference" to pop culture and modern culture. In 2004, a lawsuit was filed against the author by Jim Albright, one of Madonna's ex-lovers mentioned in the book. The lawsuit regarded an image in the book, portraying one of Madonna's gay dancers &mdash; with Albright's name underneath. United States District Court ruled out the lawsuit explaining that stating someone is homosexual does not libel or slander them.

==Summary==
The book opens with Madonna's birth, her early years in Michigan, and her 1977 move to New York City where she was involved with [[modern dance]], two pop groups, composing, and releasing her 1983 debut album, ''[[Madonna (album)|Madonna]]''. Her rise to superstardom as a pop icon is chronicled and her cutting edge music videos, albums, first concert tour, film roles, and marriage and divorce to [[Sean Penn]] are examined. The book investigates her controversial religious imagery and her erotic productions, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'', ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]'', and ''[[Body of Evidence (film)|Body of Evidence]]''. The book describes a mellowing in her appearance and provocativeness, and, among other things, the release of her next several albums, her [[Golden Globe Award]]-winning musical film portrayal of [[Eva Peron]], and her high-grossing [[Drowned World Tour]]. The birth of her daughter and son are chronicled and her marriage to [[Guy Ritchie]]. ''Madonna'' includes detailed descriptions of her relationship with individuals including [[John F. Kennedy Jr.]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

American journalist and celebrity biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] is known for his works on [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Monica Lewinsky]] and footballer [[David Beckham]] and his wife, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria]].<ref name="inde">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/morton-targets-madonna-for-his-next-biography-681360.html|title=Morton targets Madonna for his next biography|last=Jery|first=Loius|date=2001-04-14|accessdate=2011-04-13|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London}}</ref> In October 2000, Morton had hinted that he had American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as his next project, when he responded to an ''Independent'' reader in "You Ask the Questions" section.

The biography's American publishing rights were acquired by [[St. Martin's Press]].

With the [[BBC]], Morton detailed his "detective work" researching Madonna's life in New York, where she clambered her way up to fame and fortune.<ref name=livid/> "Not only is she an interesting character, but all her friends and those who've known her are interesting characters too," he said.

==Critical response==
The book received mixed reviews. Richard Lautens from ''[[Toronto Star]]'' said that "''Madonna'' is a thorough, if slightly workmanlike, retelling of its namesake's well-documented slog from lowly Midwestern beginnings to squeaky-voiced sex kitten to professional button-pusher to mother and respected, vaguely Bowie-esque, chameleonic figure, a cultural bloodhound always on the scent of the fresh, cool and credible."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/426211601.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+22%2C+2001&author=Ben+Rayner&pub=Toronto+Star&desc=The+people's+biographer+%3B+Celebrity+author+Andrew+Morton+pens+Madonna+book&pqatl=google|title=The people's biographer ; Celebrity author Andrew Morton pens Madonna book|last=Lautens|first=Richard|last2=Rayner|first2=Ben|date=2001-11-22|accessdate=2011-04-12|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Torstar]]}}</ref> Helen Bushby from [[BBC]] commented that "[t]he book is certainly detailed, and will no doubt keep Madonna fanatics happy, although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page-turner. But Morton is a good businessman, and is canny in his choice of subjects."<ref name=livid/> Michael Sneed from ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a negative review of the book and felt that Morton's previous works had been better.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F01B99F67D40855&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Di?

Randy Taraborrelli]]'s biography on her, ''[[Madonna: An Intimate Biography]]''. She added, "At least, it's the story made familiar by Madonna, a woman who has always taken for granted the world's interest in her life."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-11-05/entertainment/18353562_1_two-smoking-barrels-morton-victor/2|pages=2|title=2 New Books Ask: 'Who's That Girl?'

Rick Thames, editor of ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'', criticized the book's packaging calling the cover as "tacky, hot pink-and-acid green sleeves, featuring an unflattering photo of the dished artist."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&s_site=charlotte&p_multi=CO&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F0E56FB13AD7B79&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=2 Unbiblical Views of Madonna|last=Thames|first=Rick|date=2002-01-06|accessdate=2011-04-12|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]}}</ref> Barry Didcock from ''[[Sunday Herald]]'' felt that "Morton [had failed] to find the face of Madonna." He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], saying "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/89495563.html?dids=89495563:89495563&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+11%2C+2001&author=Barry+Didcock&pub=Sunday+Herald&desc=Morton+fails+to+find+the+face+of+Madonna&pqatl=google|title=Morton fails to find the face of Madonna|last=Didcock|first=Barry|date=2001-11-11|accessdate=2011-04-13|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|publisher=[[Newsquest]]|location=Glasgow}}</ref> Gregg Barrios from ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' was critical of the book, saying " The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs is that they have no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [Guy Ritchie] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/451657651.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+11%2C+2001&author=Gregg+Barrios&pub=The+Spectator&desc=Two+books+come+up+short+on+Madonna&pqatl=google|title=Two books come up short on Madonna|last=Barrios|first=Gregg|date=2001-12-01|accessdate=2011-04-012|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern and Shell]]}}</ref> Barbara Ellen from ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized Morton's writing by saying, "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes [[Sean Penn]] and [[Warren Beatty]] are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/nov/11/biography.madonna|title=Immaterial Girl|date=2001-11-11|accessdate=2011-04-13|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|last=Ellen|first=Barbara}}</ref>

==Commercial reception==
''Madonna: An Intimate Biography'' was released in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/25/books/best-sellers-november-25-2001.html?|pages=2|title=BEST SELLERS: November 25, 2001|date=2001-11-25|accessdate=2011-04-013|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> It was a commercial disappointment, failing to sell even close to its initial print-run of 500,000. According to [[Nielsen BookScan]], ''Madonna'' has sold around 240,000 copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2001-11-31|title=BEST SELLERS: November 31, 2001|volume=1213|issue=06|issn=0362-4331|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Pareles|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Pareles|date=2002-10-10|title=Taraborrelli's book continues to sell large|volume=1209|issue=12|issn=0362-4331|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth had little to do with it", after the book was released.<ref name=livid>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1703787.stm|title=Morton's Madonna mania|date=2001-12-11|accessdate=2011-04-012|publisher=[[BBC]] ([[BBC Online]])|location=London|last=Bushby|first=Helen}}</ref> With [[Jo Whiley]] from ''[[BBC Radio 1]]'', she added that "[Morton] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it <U+2013> and please leave my friends alone'." The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy<U+2014>''The Power of Kabbalah''<U+2014>to try to dissuade him from continuing. "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about <U+2013> that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," Madonna added.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1672352.stm|title=Madonna 'angry' over Morton book|last=Whiley|first=Jo|authorlink=Jo Whiley|date=2001-11-23|accessdate=2011-04-012|location=London|publisher=[[BBC]] ([[BBC Online]])}}</ref> During the [[Drowned World Tour]] of 2001, Madonna was asked whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: "Why yes, I always send bibles and philosophy books to my biographers." Motioning to her then husband [[Guy Ritchie]] she continued, "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course."<ref>{{Cite book | last = Taraborrelli  | first = Randy J. | authorlink = J.

I never saw a groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," adding that Morton's claims were a retread of "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old."<ref name=ray>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2001-11-01/gossip/18353223_1_liz-rosenberg-andrew-morton-second-abortion|title=Rays Of Light On Madonna's Sex Life?|last=Rush|first=George|date=2001-11-01|accessdate=2011-04-012|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]}}</ref> Morton remained unabashed, saying that he wrote the book because of his interest in the star, not least because she has made a "difference" to pop culture and modern culture.<ref name=livid/> He added:
<blockquote>
"I'm very proud of the book and I'm very disappointed at Madonna's reaction. I think the problem is that she wants control over everything <U+2013> that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open <U+2013> Madonna's welcome to my house for a cup of tea.<ref name=livid/>
<br />
She said she wasn't interested in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which is a bit of a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because I felt that we've only ever seen the caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2001/1115/fe20-1.html|title=Pop diva's love and life |last=Hu Ann|first=Kate|date=2001-11-15|accessdate=2011-04-12|work=[[Shanghai Star]]|publisher=[[China Daily]]|location=Shanghai}}</ref>

==Lawsuit==
''Madonna'' faced a lawsuit in 2004 over an image in the book.<ref name=book>{{cite book|last=Wolff|first=Nancy E.|title=The Professional Photographer's Legal Handbook|year=2007|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing|Allworth Communications, Inc.]]|isbn=1581154771|pages=231<U+2013>233}}</ref> Titled ''Amarak Productions, Inc. vs. Morton'', Madonna's former bodyguard and ex-lover Jim Albright brought a defamation case against Morton, based on an incorrect photo caption.<ref name=book/> The photo had a caption identifying the subject in it as Albright; it was actually one of Madonna's homosexual back-up dancers, Jose Gutierez. ''Amarak Productions, Inc.'' had employed Albright as Madonna's bodyguard in 1992, and he became romantically involved with her.<ref name=gay/> While writing ''Madonna'', Morton contacted Albright to gather information on their relationship. On discovering the misleading image, the lawsuit was filed by Albright who objected the caption.<ref name=gay/>

On May 30, 2004, US District judge Nancy Gertner ruled out the lawsuit explaining that stating someone homosexual does not libel or slander them, particularly in light of new court decisions granting gays more rights.<ref name=gay/> Gertner first rejected the idea that the mistake in captioning constituted a statement that Albright was gay. She added: "Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly give them effect. In this day and age, recent rulings by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] and the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judiciary Court of Massachusetts]] undermine any suggestion that a statement implying that an individual is homosexual is defamatory.<ref name=gay>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zg8hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9HQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4108,4025826&dq=madonna+andrew+morton+albright&hl=en|title=Judge: Being Called Homosexual Not Libelous |author=[[Associated Press]]|date=2004-05-30|accessdate=2011-04-13|work=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]|publisher=Walter E.
