The '''Eternal Word Television Network''' ('''EWTN''') is an [[United States|American]] [[television]] [[Television network|network]] which presents around-the-clock [[Catholicism|Catholic]]-themed programming.  It was founded by [[Mother Angelica|Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation]], [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration|PCPA]] in 1980 and began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, from a garage [[Television studio|studio]] at the Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in [[Irondale, Alabama|Irondale]], [[Alabama]], which Mother Angelica founded in 1962.  She hosted her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'' until suffering a major [[stroke]] and other health issues in September 2001.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=86 EWTN Press Release - Two Years After Suffering a Major Stroke Mother Angelica Lives Her Life of Prayer]</ref>  Repeats now air as either the ''Best of Mother Angelica Live'' or ''Mother Angelica Live Classics''.  She now leads a [[cloistered]] life at the [[Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament]] in [[Hanceville, Alabama]].

The network, through diocesan television channels in other [[Catholic countries]], advertises itself as the '''EWTN: The Global Catholic Network'''. Regular programs include a daily [[Holy Mass]] and sometimes [[Tridentine Mass]] format, the traditional [[Stations of the Cross]], a taped daily recitation of the [[Rosary]], and daily and weekly news, discussion, and [[Catechetical]] programs for both adults and children.  [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] programming; the installation Masses of [[bishop]]s and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]]; coverage of [[World Youth Day]]s; and [[Pope|papal]] visits, deaths, funerals, [[Papal conclave|conclaves]], and [[List of papal elections|elections]] are also presented.  EWTN also has a presence on [[Satellite radio|satellite]]<ref>[http://www.siriusxm.com/ewtn SiriusXM page]</ref> and [[shortwave]] [[radio]].<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/radio/freq.htm EWTN Shortwave Radio Frequency Guide]</ref>  [[Spanish language]] broadcasts are available on all platforms.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/espanol/index.asp EWTN Spanish website]</ref>  On December 8, 2009, EWTN began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/prwire/headline.php?ID=8054 EWTN To Be Made Available in HD - Prwire - Catholic Online]</ref>

EWTN has occasionally been the subject of criticism for its [[social]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Catholic theology|theological]] positions regarding the tone and presentation of [[Catholic doctrine]]. The network's current Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer is Michael P. Warsaw.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/media/ourManagement.htm EWTN Press Room]</ref> While the network has trustees, it does not have shareholders or owners. A majority of the network's funding is from viewer donations to which it advertises ''100% viewer supported'', which keeps it from advertising secular or non-Catholic programming. Its traditional plea for donations is "Keep us between your gas and electric bill".<ref>[https://www.ewtn.com/donatenow/ Online Donations | EWTN]</ref><ref>According to Father [[Andrew Apostoli]], TV host of EWTN: Sunday Night Prime, the saying is derived from the practice of Mother Angelica asking [[Jesus Christ]] for financial help, by placing a letter of request between the gas and electric bill (sometimes Gas and Telephone bill). The saying was later adopted for benefactors who donate to EWTN, in response to propagating its ministry.</ref>

The EWTN network also contributes in the  publication of the ''[[National Catholic Register]]'' newspaper, which was acquired in January 2011.<ref name="ncregister.com">[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/national-catholic-register-acquired-by-ewtn/ National Catholic Register Acquired by EWTN | Daily News | NCRegister.com]</ref> The network maintains a web presence through its primary website, EWTN.com, and it also has a dedicated commerce site, EWTNReligiousCatalogue.com.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/cataloguefeatured/ EWTN Religious Catalogue]</ref>

==Development of EWTN==
[[Image:EWTN studip.JPG|thumb|200px|left|EWTN's main studio in Irondale, Alabama.]]
Mother Angelica made her profession of [[Religious vows|vows]] in 1953. In 1962, she established the Our Lady of the Angels monastery. During the 1970s, she was an in-demand lecturer and produced [[Religious education|educational]] pamphlets and [[Compact Cassette|audio]] and [[Videotape|video]] tapes. She had been a guest on local station [[WIAT|WBMG]] (currently WIAT, Channel 42), and on shows on the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After she gave an interview on then-Christian station [[WCPX-TV|WCFC]] (Channel 38) in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], she decided she wanted her own network. "I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember standing in the doorway and thinking, 'It doesn't take much to reach the masses'. I just stood there and said to the Lord, 'Lord, I've got to have one of these'".<ref>{{ cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFD71F3FF93BA35753C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Scandals Aside, TV Preachers Thrive |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |first=Peter |last=Applebome |date=October 8, 1989 }}</ref>

Mother Angelica purchased satellite space and EWTN began broadcasting on August 15, 1981, with four hours of daily programming, which included her own show, ''Mother Angelica Live'' (aired bi-weekly), a Sunday Mass, and reruns of older Catholic programs such as Archbishop [[Fulton J. Sheen]]'s ''[[Life Is Worth Living]]''. The remainder of the time was filled with shows produced by dioceses across the country, shows from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sources which Mother Angelica determined were in concert with [[Catholic doctrine|Catholic teachings]], and children's shows such as ''Joy Junction'' and ''The Sunshine Factory''. About one-third of programming time consisted of secular content, such as re-runs of ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', [[public domain]] films, and cooking and [[Western (genre)|western]]-themed shows. EWTN eventually increased its broadcast schedule to six hours per day and then to eight hours per day by 1986. Secular content was gradually reduced from 1986 to 1988, and [[Satellite television|satellite distribution]] was expanded late in 1987, after which EWTN acquired a far more desirable satellite channel and began broadcasting around the clock. At this point, EWTN began broadcasting the praying of the rosary on a daily basis and added a number of educational shows. In-house production of original programming gradually increased. The Mass became televised daily in 1991 from a chapel on the monastery grounds. Most shows from non-Catholic sources were eliminated and a more theological image gradually developed.

==Radio==
{{main|WEWN}}
In 1992, EWTN established the largest privately owned shortwave radio station, WEWN, in the Birmingham area.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In 1999, programs included "Mother Angelica Live" and "Life Is Worth Living" with Fulton J. Sheen. [[WNMB|WGSN]] in [[North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|North Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]] was an affiliate.<ref>Toby Eddings, "Time to get back on the '[[Soul Train]]'," ''The Sun News'', May 30, 1999.</ref> Current Radio programs include "Open Line" in which callers can get answers about the [[Catholic Faith]].

In 2004, EWTN announced an agreement with [[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius Satellite Radio]] which has since merged with [[XM Radio]] to become Sirius XM Radio.

==Newspapers==
{{main|National Catholic Register}}
In January 2011, EWTN acquired the ''National Catholic Register'', a newspaper founded in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] in 1924 as a periodical for local Catholics and which became a national publication three years later.  EWTN officially assumed total control on February 1.<ref name="ncregister.com"/>

==News coverage==
The EWTN news department produces a daily news service for television and radio, featuring news sources including [[Vatican Radio]]. They also produce ''The World Over Live'', which covers relevant current events.  It is hosted by journalist and author [[Raymond Arroyo]], who is also EWTN's news director. The program is conservative in its political orientation and generally conservative in its religious orientation.  Notable guests have included Robert Rector of the [[Heritage Foundation]], author and activist [[George Weigel]], political commentator [[Laura Ingraham]], conservative political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]], and the late columnist and commentator [[Robert Novak]], a [[Jewish]] convert to Catholicism.

==History of programming==
In its early history, EWTN broadcast Catholic-produced programming from a wide variety of Catholic sources. This ranged from Catholic charismatic programming such as [[Michael Manning (priest)|Fr. Michael Manning]], to shows focusing on [[social reform]] and [[social justice]], such as ''Christopher Closeup'', to [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|doctrinal teaching]] shows hosted by various clergy.

In the early 1990s, EWTN began producing more of its own shows. This marked a distinctive conservative shift in the network's overall orientation, with programs featuring topics on social reform and justice gradually being phased out and replaced with general doctrinal teaching and discussion programs. This shift was apparent in the daily televised Masses, which, in 1992, began incorporating [[Latin]] into the liturgy and gradually no longer featured contemporary music. Some non-televised Masses are in all [[English language|English]] and some have more contemporary music. On [[Christmas Eve]] 1993, Mother Angelica and the nuns of her order reverted to traditional [[Religious habit|habits]]. From 1992 on, the Latin portions of the Mass included the Gloria, introduction of the Gospel readings, the Sanctus, and the rest of the mass after the Great Amen, beginning with the Lord's Prayer.

Among its notable weekly programs are ''The Journey Home'' and ''Life on the Rock''. ''The Journey Home'', hosted by Marcus Grodi, is aimed at [[Religious conversion|converts]] to the Catholic faith. Grodi himself is a former [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] who converted to Catholicism in 1992.<ref>[http://chnetwork.org/information/marcus-grodi/ Marcus Grodi | The Coming Home Network]</ref> Although most guests are former Protestants, former adherents of non-[[Christianity|Christian]] faiths (such as [[Judaism]]) and former [[Atheism|atheists]] have occasionally appeared. ''Life on the Rock'' is hosted by Fr. Mark Mary, [[Franciscan Missionaries of the Eternal Word|MFVA]] and Doug Barry.

EWTN HD, a [[HDTV|high definition]] simulcast of EWTN, became available to affiliates on December 8, 2009. President and CEO Michael P. Warsaw said "We chose to launch HD in December so we could bring our viewers all the beautiful images of the Christmas season using the most advanced technology.  We are proud to say that we are the only Catholic television network available in this format."<ref>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/365792-EWTN_Plans_HD_Launch_In_December.php Multichannel News October 20, 2009 EWTN Plans HD Launch In December - Global Catholic Net Says Feed Will Be Available to Affiliates Dec. 8]</ref> The HD feed first became available to Comcast customers in Richmond, VA and vicinity on May 11, 2010.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/general/press/pr_detail.asp?id=283 EWTN HD Launches on Comcast in Richmond Area]</ref>

In October 2011, EWTN became available through the [[Roku]] streaming player. The player provides six live channels of EWTN for free (including [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[German language|German]] languages), allowing users to watch the channel on their television. In addition, select EWTN programs can be viewed as a [[video on demand]] option as well as a live feed of [[WEWN|EWTN Radio]] is available.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/another-ewtn-first-catholic-network-to-launch-on-roku-2011-10-19 Another EWTN First: Catholic Network To Launch on Roku] Retrieved October 19, 2011</ref>

Often, EWTN airs special programming: holiday-specific programs as well as coverage the deaths of [[pope]]s; papal [[Papal conclave|conclaves]], [[Papal election|elections]], [[Papal Inauguration|inaugurations]] and visits; [[Easter]], Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Masses; the installations of [[bishop]]s, [[archbishop]]s, and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]]; and [[World Youth Day]].

==Criticisms==

=== Controversies and disputes ===
In a 1993 episode of ''Mother Angelica Live'', Mother Angelica harshly criticized a [[Mime artist|mimed]] re-enactment of the [[Stations of the Cross]] at the World Youth Day in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], which was attended by Pope [[John Paul II]]. Mother Angelica was particularly upset that a woman was playing Jesus. Archbishop [[Rembert Weakland]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee|Archdiocese of Milwaukee]] called Mother Angelica's comments "...one of the most disgraceful, un-Christian, offensive, and divisive diatribes I have ever heard".<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n42_v29/ai_14219077/ Archbishop Weakland calls Mother Angelica&#039;s statements &#039;disgraceful.&#039; - Aug 14, 1993 telecast denouncing Catholic liberalism | National Catholic Reporter | Find Articles at BNET]</ref> Mother Angelica responded by saying, "He didn't think a woman playing Jesus was offensive? He can go put his head in the back toilet as far as I am concerned!"<ref>Raymond Arroyo, ''Mother Angelica: the Remarkable Story of a Nun, Her Nerve and a Network of Miracles''. (pp. 243-244)</ref>

In 1997, Mother Angelica publicly criticized Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]], then the archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]], for his [[pastoral letter]] on the [[Eucharist]] called "Gather Faithfully Together: A Guide for Sunday Mass", which she perceived had a lack of emphasis on [[transubstantiation]]:<ref>[http://staparish.net/refs/gather.html St. Thomas Aquinas]</ref> "I<U+2019>m afraid my obedience in that diocese would be absolutely zero. And I hope everybody else<U+2019>s in that diocese is zero".<ref>Margaret O'Brien Steinfels [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_n2_v125/ai_20520542 Liturgical confusion-criticism over a pastoral letter] Editorial, ''[[Commonweal]]'', January 30, 1998</ref> Cardinal Mahony regarded her comments as accusing him of [[heresy]].<ref>John L. Allen, Jr. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n6_v34/ai_20067461 Mahony sees nun's critique as heresy charge-Cardinal Roger Mahony; dispute with televangelist Mother M. Angelica], National Catholic Reporter,  Dec 5, 1997.</ref> Mother Angelica later issued a conditional apology for her comments.

In 1999, Bishop [[David Edward Foley|David Foley]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Birmingham in Alabama|diocese of Birmingham, Alabama]] issued a decree prohibiting priests in his diocese from celebrating Mass ''[[ad orientem]]'' ("to the east"; that is, with both the priest and the people facing east) under most circumstances.<ref name="NCR"/> Although the decree did not specifically mention EWTN, the wording of the decree, which stated that "...any Mass that is or will be televised for broadcast or videotaped for public dissemination", supporters and critics alike generally agreed that the decree was written with EWTN specifically in mind. Bishop Foley stated that the practice of having the priest's back to the people "amounts to making a political statement and is dividing the people."<ref name="NCR">John L. Allen, Jr. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_5_36/ai_57873451 EWTN's bishop says priests must face the people-Eternal Word Television Network]-Brief Article, National Catholic Reporter November 19, 1999.</ref>

On January 1, 2006, a book critical of EWTN, ''EWTN: A Network Gone Wrong'' by [[Christopher Ferrara]], was published. The book claimed that EWTN was firmly embracing a pre Vatican II Catholicism along with Mother Angelica. The book further claims that once Mother Angelica ended her daily involvement with EWTN the network became "Modernist" and pro Novus Ordo.  According to the book's promotional website, "Basing itself on extensive evidence taken from EWTN<U+2019>s own content, and comparing that content to the perennial belief and practice of the Church, the book shows that EWTN<U+2019>s 'moderately Modernist' version of the Faith is precisely what [[Pope Pius X|St. Pius X]] had in view when he condemned Modernism in all its forms, including what His Holiness called 'the Modernist as reformer'."

==Papal Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice Award==
In 2000, Archbishop [[Roberto Gonz<U+00E1>lez Nieves]] of San Juan, Puerto Rico performed an [[apostolic visitation]] of EWTN. There is some dispute whether the visitation was valid since the United States is not under the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico. Nieves determined that there were three distinct problems: the actual ownership of the network, the monastery's right to give property to EWTN, and, since she had never been elected, the legitimacy of Mother Angelica's authority.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mother+Angelica%3A+The+remarkable+story+of+a+nun,+her+nerve+and+a...-a0138657333 Mother Angelica: The remarkable story of a nun, her nerve and a network of miricles. - Free Online Library]</ref>

Subsequently the matter was resolved when, in 2009, EWTN was given the [[Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice]] directly by the [[Holy See]]. This award was given to Mother Angelica and the EWTN leadership as an expression of gratitude for their service to the Church.<ref>[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/papal_award_validates_mission_of_ewtn_says_ceo]</ref>

==Viewership statistics==
EWTN is the largest religious media network in the world. As of 2008, its programming reached more than 148 million homes in 144 countries and territories on more than 4,800 [[Cable television|cable]] systems, wireless cable, [[direct broadcast satellite]], [[Low-power broadcasting|low power television]], and individual [[Satellite television|satellite]] users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ewtn.com/general/index.asp}}</ref>  The organization's revenues were $43.6 million in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3675#.VA8_HVeTHKc}}</ref>
