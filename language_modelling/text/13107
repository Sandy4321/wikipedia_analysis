==Family and early life==
Olympias was a [[Greeks|Greek]]<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> woman who was the daughter of the wealthy [[Crete|Cretan]] [[Ablabius (consul 331)|Flavius Ablabius]]<ref>Jones, ''The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire: Volume 1, AD 260-395, Parts 260-395'', p.p.3-4</ref> by an unnamed woman.<ref>Moret, ''Sertorius, Libanios, iconographie: a propos de Sertorius, journ<U+00E9>e d'<U+00E9>tude, Toulouse, 7 avril 2000 [suivi de] autour de Libanios, culture et soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> dans l'antiquit<U+00E9> tardive : actes de la table ronde, Avignon, 27 avril 2000'', p.207</ref> Ablabius was one of the most important [[Roman Senate|Roman Senators]] of [[Constantinople]];<ref>[[Eunapius]], ''The Life of Philosophers and Sophists'', Book VI.

==Constantinian dynasty==
As Olympias<U+2019> father had acquired great influence over the [[Roman emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]] who seem to be attached to the emperor.<ref>Salzman, ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'', p.302</ref> Shortly before the death of Constantine I, the emperor along with Ablabius had arranged for Olympias to be engaged to [[Constans]] one of the sons of the emperor.<ref>[http://www.roman-emperors.org/consi.htm De Imperatoribus Romanis - An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors: Constans I (337-350 A.D.)]</ref> When Constantine I died in May 337, he was succeeded by his sons and among them was Constans. In 338, due to her father<U+2019>s fall out with Constans<U+2019> brother [[Constantius II]] and his initial execution, Constans never married Olympias.<ref>Smith, ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines N to S Part Seven'', p.73</ref> For as long as Constans lived, Constans took care of Olympias and they had lived together as if Olympias was the wife of Constans.<ref>Smith, ''A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines N to S Part Seven'', p.73</ref> In 350 when Constans died, Olympias still lived in Constantinople with the remaining relatives of Constans.

==Wife of Arsaces II of Armenia==
The Roman Client King of [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid Armenia]] [[Arshak II|Arsaces II (Arshak II)]], was greatly favored by Constantius II who remitted all the Armenian taxes<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> on the lands which the Kings of Armenia owned in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].<ref>Kurkjian, ''A History of Armenia'', p.103</ref> As a sign of the renewed [[Christian]] [[Arianism]] political alliance<ref>Nordgren, ''The Well Spring Of The Goths: About The Gothic Peoples in The Nordic Countries And On The Continent'', p.385</ref><ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> between Armenia and [[Ancient Rome]], Constantius II had given to Arsaces II, Olympias as an imperial bride to him.<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> Constantius II in the honor of Olympias, had struck special medals bearing the portrait of [[Olympias]], who was the mother of the Greek King [[Alexander the Great]], which the legend of the medals were in [[Latin]] ''OLYMPIAS REGINA'' or ''of queen Olympias''.<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> The reigning [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Catholicos]] [[St. Nerses I]], was sent by Arsaces II from Armenia to bring Olympias from Constantinople back to Armenia to marry her as his wife.<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref>

Olympias is considered as the first known wife of Arsaces II, as prior to his kingship was previously married to an unknown woman by whom he had a son called [[Anob of Armenia|Anob]].<ref>According to Saint [[Mesrop Mashtots]], the priest & historiographer of [[St. Nerses I|the Catholicos Nerses the Great]], gives the name Anob as the father of Papas<U+2019> nephew [[Varazdat|Varasdates (Varazdat)]]. Also according to [[Faustus of Byzantium]], Book IV - Chapter 37 Varasdates proclaims himself as the nephew of [[Pap of Armenia|Papas (Pap)]]</ref> Saint [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in a letter addressed to the Anchorites, reproaches Constantius II for marrying Olympias to Arsaces II.<ref>Kurkjian, ''A History of Armenia'', p.103</ref><ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, Volume 2'', p.516</ref> Athanasius reproaches Constantius II, for having an educated woman like Olympias destined to be a wife of an emperor exalted to the dignity of a barbarian (foreign) king.<ref>Gibbon, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, Volume 2'', p.516</ref><ref>Kurkjian, ''A History of Armenia'', p.103</ref>

When Olympias arrived in Armenia with St. Nerses I, Olympias was married to Arsaces II. Although Olympias had no children with Arsaces II, they appeared to have a happy marriage, as Arsaces II loved Olympias.<ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> The Romans considered Olympias as the legitimate wife of Arsaces II as this [[Queen consort]], maintained her influence on her husband. Arsaces II was faithful to the Roman and Christian alliance<ref>Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''</ref> and Olympias would have become a very powerful, wealthy and influential woman in Armenian society.

==Pharantzem==
As Constantius II died in 361, [[Julian the Apostate]] succeeded his paternal cousin as Roman emperor. On Julian<U+2019>s accession, Olympias<U+2019> influence on her husband made his fidelity to waver.<ref>Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''</ref>  Arsaces II later married the Armenian noblewoman [[Pharantzem]] who was the widow of Arsaces II<U+2019>s nephew, the Arsacid Prince [[Gnel of Armenia|Gnel]].<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref><ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> In [[Persian people|Persian fashion]] Arsaces II had more than one wife.<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> Sometime after Pharantzem<U+2019>s marriage to Arsaces II, she fell pregnant. In 360 Pharantzem bore Arsaces II a son, whom they named [[Pap of Armenia|Papas (Pap)]].<ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> Papas was the only known child born to Pharantzem and the only known child born to Arsaces II during his Armenian Kingship.

Pharantzem had a grudge and had a great envy against Olympias, in which Arsaces II loved Olympias more than Pharantzem.<ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> Arsaces II loved Pharantzem to a degree but Pharantzem loathed Arsaces II saying, <U+201C>Physically, he is hairy, and his color is dark<U+201D>.<ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> After the birth of her son, Pharantzem plotted to kill Olympias through poison. Pharantzem had arranged for Olympias to be poisoned in 361<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> administered to her in the Holy Sacrament of communion by a priest<ref>Kurkjian, ''A History of Armenia'', p.105</ref> from the royal court. Olympias was extremely careful in where she accepted matters of food and drink from as she only accepted food and drink offered to her from her maids.<ref>Faustus of Byzantium, ''History of the Armenians'', Book IV, Chapter 15</ref> Olympias was poisoned through communion. 

The death of Olympias, was one of the reasons that the church was totally alienated from the royal court of Arsaces II and [[St. Nerses I]] being totally outraged was not seen again in the royal court in the lifetime of Arsaces II.<ref>Hovannisian, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', p.89</ref> The actions of Pharantzem towards Olympias had placed Armenian politics unfavorable to Christian interests and she was considered an impious woman.<ref>Gibbon, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''</ref> After the death of Olympias, Pharantzem became the Armenian Queen.
