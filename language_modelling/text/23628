At the '''[[2001 East Asian Games]]''', the '''[[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]]''' events were held in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]] from 23 to 26 May [[2001 in athletics (track and field)|2001]]. A total of 45 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 22 by female athletes. All events were held at the [[Nagai Stadium]], with the exception of the [[racewalking]] and [[half marathon]] events. A team of [[Australia]]n athletes took part in the competition but they were excluded from the medal tally.<ref>[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/easg.htm East Asian Games]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2010-02-28.</ref> This was the last time that [[Kazakhstan]] competed in the competition.

In the third edition of the [[multi-sport event]], 20 [[List of East Asian Games records in athletics|Games records]] were improved over the four-day athletics competition. [[People's Republic of China|China]] had the greatest gold medal haul with 27, largely due to the success of their women athletes, who won all but three of the women's events. The hosts, Japan, won the most medals overall, winning 11 golds, 22 silvers and 51 medals in total. The women's events over [[400 metres]] brought a number of [[Japanese records in athletics|Japanese records]]: [[Kazue Kakinuma]] broke the 400&nbsp;m sprint record, [[Makiko Yoshida]] set a new record in the [[400 metres hurdles]], and the [[4<U+00D7>400 metres relay]] team made a new national best of 3:33.06. Seventeen-year-old [[Liu Xiang]] set a new [[110 metres hurdles]] record of 13.42 for the first gold medal of his career.

All the Games records in the [[relay race]]s were broken, meaning that both [[Shingo Suetsugu]] (who broke the [[200 metres]] record) and [[Bu Fanfang]] (who broke the 400&nbsp;m record) made new Games records in multiple events. Some athletes took on two individual events in the competition schedule and doubled their medal hauls: [[Gennadiy Chernovol]] took 100&nbsp;m gold and 200&nbsp;m silver while his Kazakh compatriot [[Mihail Kolganov]] won gold in the 800 and 1500&nbsp;m. [[Wu Wen-Chien]] did a bronze double in the 5000&nbsp;m and steeplechase for [[Chinese Taipei]], and [[Dong Yanmei]] won two golds in the 5000 and 10,000&nbsp;m events. [[Kumiko Ikeda]] of Japan set personal bests in the [[long jump]] and [[100 metres hurdles]] for a silver and bronze medal, respectively.<ref>Nakamura, Ken (2001-05-28).
