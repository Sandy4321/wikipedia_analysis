'''Susan Bysiewicz''' (born [[1961]]) served as [[Secretary of the State of Connecticut]] from 1999 to 2011.

==Early life, education, and law career==
Bysiewicz was raised on a farm{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], and graduated from [[Yale University]] and [[Duke University School of Law]]. While pursuing her law degree, she wrote ''Ella: A Biography of Governor [[Ella Grasso]]''.<ref>Susan Bysiewicz, [http://www.cclce.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=151:ella-a-biography-of-governor-ella-grasso&catid=107:print-resources&Itemid=125 Ella: A Biography of Governor Ella Grasso], Old Saybrook, CT: Peregrine Press, 1984.</ref> (Grasso is remembered in Connecticut both for pioneering women's roles in politics, and for serving in late stages of fatal cancer.) Bysiewicz practiced law in [[New York City]], and then in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].

==Political career==
===State legislature===
She was elected state representative for the 100th Assembly District of Connecticut for three successive terms starting in 1992, representing until 1998 about 22,000 constituents living in parts of the towns of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] (64% of her constituents) and [[Middlefield, Connecticut|Middlefield]] (10%), and throughout the town of [[Durham, Connecticut|Durham]] (26%).<ref>''Connecticut State Register and Manual, 1995'', Secretary of the State, Hartford</ref>  

===Secretary of State===
In 1998, she sought the Democratic nomination for  [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of the State]]. At the state Democratic Convention, she lost the party's endorsement for the nomination, to Representative Ellen Scalettar, but won enough delegates' votes to qualify to run for the nomination in a [[primary election|primary]]. During the primary campaign she charged her opponent opposed [[Megan's Law]] and was soft on sex offenders <ref>http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15054340.html</ref> She won both the nomination, and, in the [[general election]] in November, the office itself. She won re-election in 2002, but in 2005, while serving, she announced her [[candidate|candidacy]] for the Democratic [[nomination]] for the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2006|gubernatorial election of 2006]]. She withdrew from that race in September 2005, and on November 7, 2006, won a third [[Term of office|term]] (running through 2010) as Secretary of the State. 
 
In her time as the chief elections officer and business registrar of the state, she has made technology a focus of her administration. Bysiewicz developed Connecticut<U+2019>s first electronic filing system for voter registration to prevent fraud and encourage registration.  She also instituted an electronic business searching system called CONCORD that allows users to search a database of all the registered companies in the State of Connecticut.  

In 2006/2007 Secretary Bysiewicz implemented new voting technology including adoption of the optical scan machine and a vote-by-phone procedure so that Connecticut voters with disabilities are able to vote securely and independently.  She advocated with success at the legislature for the passage of a constitutional amendment that would allow 17 year olds to vote in primaries.<ref>"Constitutional amendment allowing 17 year-olds to vote going on the ballot."

Retrieved October 26, 2010</ref>

=== Public record controversy ===
On February 7, 2010, the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' reported that Attorney General Blumenthal was investigating whether Bysiewicz violated the law by using e-mail addresses obtained by her office in their official duties for campaign use<U+2014>soliticing campaign support and donations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/breaking/hc-bysiewicz-complaint-0207.artfeb07,0,6184799.column |title=Prompting A Probe: Bysiewicz Put Her Public Office's Database To Private Political Use - Hartford Courant |publisher=Courant.com |date=2010-02-06 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

==2010 gubernatorial election==
===Campaign===
On January 27, 2009, Bysiewicz made public her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut in the 2010 election.<ref name="Hartford Courant">{{cite web | url=http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hcu-ap-bysiewicz-0127,0,2815946.story | date=2009-01-27 | accessdate=2009-01-27 | title = Bysiewicz Says She'll Run For Governor | publisher=[http://www.courant.com/about/custom/thc/ The Hartford Courant]}}</ref>

===Polling===
In February 2009, Quinnipiac University conducted a poll in which they asked:<U+201C>If the Democratic primary for governor were being held today and the candidates were [[Dan Malloy]], Susan Bysiewicz and Jim Amann, for whom would you vote?<U+201D>  Of the Democrats who responded, 44% said they would vote for Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz, 12% said they would vote for Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy and 4% said they would vote for James Amann, former Speaker of the House.<ref>[http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/state_capitol/qpoll_puts_bysiewicz_in_lead_a.php CT Newsjunkie <U+2013> Christine Stuart <U+2013> Feb 12, 2009 - Q-Poll: Puts Bysiewicz in Lead Amongst Dems]</ref>

In a poll conducted by the Susan Bysiewicz gubernatorial exploratory committee in October 2009, support for incumbent Governor [[Jodi Rell]] fell to 47% in a head to head contest with Susan Bysiewicz who received 41% of the respondents<U+2019> vote.  When asked how they would vote if the election was held between Rell and Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, poll respondents said they would vote 52% for Rell and 31% for Malloy.  In Bridgeport alone, those taking part in the poll were asked who they would vote for if the primary were held that day and they said Bysiewicz 31.44 percent, Malloy 14.56 percent.<ref>[http://blog.ctnews.com/kantrowitz/2009/10/27/susan-bysiewicz-still-way-ahead-in-democratic-run-for-governor/ Susan Bysiewicz Still Way Ahead In Democratic Run For Governor - October 27, 2009 at 3:28 pm by Jonathan Kantrowitz]</ref>

In January 2010 Bysiewicz dropped her bid for Governor, choosing to instead run for [[Connecticut attorney general election, 2010|Attorney General]].  On January 21, 2010 Quinnipiac University released its results a poll of the primary for Attorney General which found that Susan Bysiewicz had a 52-point lead (Bysiewicz 62, Jepsen 10, Undecided 24, 593 Democratic Voters, MOE +/- 4%).<ref>[http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1296.xml?ReleaseID=1416 January 21, 2010 - Lamont Has Early Name Edge In Connecticut Gov Race, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Bysiewicz Tops Dems In Attorney General Race]</ref>

===Controversy===
On November 3, one day after the general election, Bysiewicz presumptively announced that democratic candidate [[Dannel Malloy]] was the winner of the governor race, beating republican [[Thomas C. Foley|Tom Foley]].<ref>http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2010/11/04/news/elections/doc4cd193af12a02573345266.txt</ref> Later that evening the [[Associated Press]], who had also called the race largely based on Bysiewicz' announcement, "un-called" the race when it found that Foley actually led in its vote count.<ref>http://www.registercitizen.com/articles/2010/11/03/news/doc4ccf8aebb2972465649690.txt</ref> One major reason for the election discrepancies was the conduct of the election in Bridgeport, where local officials ordered an inadequate number of ballots to meet turnout. <ref> http://articles.courant.com/2010-11-04/news/hc-ed-bridgeport-ballot-blunder-1104-20101104_1 </ref> Bysiewicz cited these counting delays---including an bag of uncounted ballots found after Election Day <ref> http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/elections/2010/races/race-2/Bag-of-Uncounted-Ballots-Found-in-Bridgeport-106727208.html </ref> -- caused by the ballot shortages in Bridgeport for the confusion, though despite her role as Chief Elections Officer she denied bearing any responsibility for the ballot shortages.<ref>http://ctmirror.org/story/8282/bysiewicz-bridgeport-ballot-snafu-not-her-fault</ref> Bysiewicz said she had directed local officials to order enough ballots but had not monitored Bridgeport officials to ensure the directive was followed. .<ref>http://ctmirror.org/story/8282/bysiewicz-bridgeport-ballot-snafu-not-her-fault</ref>

Bysiewicz planned to (re-)announce the winner of the election on Friday, November 5, this time after officially receiving all of the ballot results.<ref>http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2010/11/bysiewicz-official-gubernatori.html</ref> Late afternoon, Friday, November 5, Bysiewicz (re-)announced Dannel Malloy as the winner in the gubernatorial election, but this time by a different vote total (5,637 votes) than her premature announcement two days earlier when she declared Malloy the winner by 3,103 votes.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-ct-governor-election-results-1106-20101105,0,7794031.story</ref>

== 2010 Attorney General election ==
After Bysiewicz announced her bid for Attorney General, a number of observers questioned her legal qualification to hold the post, citing a state statute that requires the Attorney General to have spent ten years in "active practice" of law.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Mary E. O<U+2019>Leary, Register Topics Editor |url=http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/01/14/news/doc4b4fe8bd7fffa145176723.txt |title=Opponents question Bysiewicz qualifications for AG- The New Haven Register - Serving New Haven, Connecticut |publisher=Nhregister.com |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> Bysiewicz claimed that her years managing the Secretary of the State's office should be applied against this requirement. She sought an opinion from the current Attorney General, [[Richard Blumenthal]] on the issue.<ref>http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=30&ved=0CBoQFjAJOBQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.middletownpress.com%2Farticles%2F2010%2F01%2F21%2Fnews%2Fdoc4b57c6c877eba816626782.txt&rct=j&q=bysiewicz+qualifications&ei=g2hrS8uFGI3-tQPS4aCaAw&usg=AFQjCNFnlZUws9w8e6UPvHzAzfU7fZG1ng</ref> Blumenthal responded that he believed the law to be valid, but the question as to whether Bysiewicz met the requirements had to be decided by the courts or the legislature.<ref>http://www.wtic.com/AG-Says-Bysiewicz-s-Qualifications-Still-Unclear/6267888</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/local/statewire/hc-ap-ct-attorneygeneralfeb02,0,4093602.story |title=Justice System : Justice System News and Photos |publisher=Courant.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> 

Bysiewicz also had to explain filing a form seeking a waiver of a state fee, when she claimed not to be actively practicing law. Her spokesperson said she had made a mistake.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/breaking/hc-susan-attorney-0127.artjan28,0,6024955.story</ref> While Bysiewicz vowed to continue her campaign despite the qualifications controversy prominent Republicans suggested she was "cooked"<ref>http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2010/02/03/news/local/464632.txt</ref> and "delusional."<ref>[http://www.everydayrepublican.com/2010/02/02/delusional-bysiewicz-presses-on/]</ref>

Under deposition on March 31, 2010, Bysiewicz admitted that "she has never argued a case before a judge and couldn't remember being in a courtroom to observe litigation since law school."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/news/hartford_cty/hartford-bysiewicz-transcript |title=Bysiewicz transcript released &#124; wtnh.com connecticut |publisher=Wtnh.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>

On May 5, 2010, [[Connecticut Superior Court|Superior Court]] Judge Michael Sheldon ruled that Bysiewicz was legally qualified to run for state attorney general.<ref>{{cite web|author=By JON LENDER The Hartford Courant May 6, 2010 |url=http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-susan-bysiewicz-attorney-general-ruling-0505,0,4610724.story |title=Susan Bysiewicz: Court Ruling She's Eligible To Run For Attorney General A "Victory For Voters Of Connecticut" |publisher=Courant.com |date=2010-05-06 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> However, when the case reached the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] on May 18, Justice [[Flemming L. Norcott, Jr.]] handed down the court's 7-0 unanimous ruling that Bysiewicz failed to meet the requirements of General Statutes Section 3-124, which outlines the qualifications for state attorney general.<ref name="ctpost1">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/High-court-bounces-Bysiewicz-491658.php |title=High court bounces Bysiewicz - Connecticut Post |publisher=Ctpost.com |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.connecticutplus.com/blogs/ctpolitics/?p=251 |title=Connecticut Supreme Court ruled Susan Bysiewicz out of the race &#124; ConnecticutPlus.com Blogs <U+2013> Connecticut Politics |publisher=Connecticutplus.com |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> As a consequence, Bysiewicz was unable run for attorney general in 2010, leaving former [[Connecticut Senate|State Senator]] [[George Jepsen]] the sole remaining Democratic candidate in the race, which he subsequently won.<ref name="ctpost1"/>

== 2012 U.S. Senate election ==
{{Main|United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2012}}
On January 18, 2011 Bysiewicz announced she was a candidate in the 2012 election for the U.S. Senate seat now held by [[Joe Lieberman]], who will retire at the end of his present term. <ref> http://www.wfsb.com/news/26526180/detail.html </ref>
