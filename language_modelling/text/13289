| holding = Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license. Because California has no interest in discriminating against gay men and lesbians, and because Proposition 8 prevents California from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to provide marriages on an equal basis, the court concludes that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.

'''''Kristin M. Perry v. Arnold Schwarzenegger''''' is a federal [[lawsuit]] filed in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]] challenging the federal [[United States constitution|constitutionality]] of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], a 2008 [[initiative|ballot initiative]] that amended the [[California Constitution]] to provide that "only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California." In effect, it prohibited the recognition of [[same-sex marriages]] performed on or after November 5, 2008. The suit sought to strike down Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. 

On August 4, 2010, Chief Judge [[Vaughn R. Walker|Vaughn Walker]] ruled that Proposition 8 violated the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]. On August 16, 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ordered the judgment [[Stay of execution|stayed]] pending appeal.<ref name="stayorder">{{cite news | newspaper=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2010 | title=California Gay Marriage Remains Banned During Appeal | author=Joel Rosenblatt and Edvard Pettersson | url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-08-16/california-gay-marriage-remains-banned-during-appeal.html}}</ref>

== Background ==
In May 2008, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] held in the case ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' that state statutes limiting marriage to opposite-sex applicants violated the California Constitution. The following month, same-sex couples were able to marry in California. In November 2008, California's electorate adopted Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that restored the opposite-sex limitation on marriage.<ref name="LAT_20081105">{{cite news

On May 26, 2009, the California Supreme Court held, in ''[[Strauss v.

[[Lambda Legal]], the [[ACLU]], and the [[National Center for Lesbian Rights]], who originally obtained the right to same-sex marriage in California in ''In re Marriage Cases'' and defended it in ''Strauss v.

In scheduling a trial for January 11, 2010, to gather facts about the case, Judge Walker largely surprised both the plaintiffs and defendants.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prop8-judge-20100621,0,4456510,full.story | title=Distilling the same-sex marriage case | publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=2010-06-21 | author=Dolan, Maura | accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref><ref name="callaw_anatomy"/><ref name="chronicle_20090819" /> The trial was intended to address issues such as how having same-sex parents affects children, whether same-sex marriages undermine opposite-sex marriages,<ref name="LA">{{citeweb | url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=9504576 | title=Gay marriage trial to begin in California, could set legal precedent for generations to come | author=Leff, Lisa | publisher=''[[Associated Press]]'' | date=2010-01-07 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}</ref> the history of discrimination against gays, and the effects of prejudice against gays.<ref name="Slate">{{citeweb | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2240843/pagenum/all | title=For Better or for Worse: California's gay-marriage trial is an all-star, high-stakes affair | author=[[Emily Bazelon|Bazelon, Emily]] | publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' | date=2010-01-08 | accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref>  Notable trial witnesses included historian [[George Chauncey]], psychologist [[Gregory M.

Following the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Christian Legal Society v.

=== History of marriage ===
The plaintiffs called expert witness Nancy Cott, an American history scholar, who testified that "marriage has never been universally defined as a union of one man and one woman, and that religion has never had any bearing on the legality of a marriage".<ref name="pamd1"/> The next day, she continued her testimony, which revolved around three key points: how marriage has historically been used "punitively" to demean disfavored groups, how the legally enshrined gender roles in marriage had been disestablished during the 20th century and how the changes in the institution of marriage had mainly involved "shedding inequalities", which she said strengthens marriage.<ref name="pamd2">{{citeweb | url=http://pamshouseblend.com/diary/14812/shannon-minter-perry-v-schwarzenegger-proceedings-day-2 | title=Perry v. Schwarzenegger Proceedings, Day 2 | author=NCLR's Legal Director Shannon Minter | publisher=Pam's House Blend | accessdate=2010-01-14}}</ref> She emphasized the importance of the institution of marriage by noting that "when slaves were emancipated, they flocked to get married. And this was not trivial to them, by any means".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.equalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2010-01-12-Perry-Trial-Day-02-Cott-direct-cross-redirect-Chauncey-direct-cross-mini.pdf | title=Day 2 Transcript | publisher=[[American Foundation for Equal Rights]] | date=2010-01-12 | accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> Cott was then cross-examined by David Thompson, who took supposedly out-of-context statements from her deposition testimony and publications and asked if she agreed with them.<ref name="pamd2"/>

Defense counsel argued that marriage has [[Traditional marriage|traditionally]] been between a man and a woman because it provided a stable unit for [[procreation]] and [[child rearing]].<ref name="closing">{{citeweb | url=http://www.equalrightsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Perry-Vol-13-6-16-10.pdf | title=''Perry v.

=== Discrimination ===
Professor [[George Chauncey]] of [[Yale University]], a social historian who specializes in [[LGBT history]],<ref name="pamd2"/> described how previous government campaigns had attempted "to demonize gay people as dangerous sexual deviants and child molesters".<ref name="pamd2"/> He then analyzed campaign material from the Yes on 8 campaign to show how they played upon the same message.<ref name="pamd2"/> He analyzed the words of Dr. [[Hak-Shing William Tam|Hak-Shing William ("Bill") Tam]],<ref name="pamd3"/> which included assertions that, were California to fail to pass Proposition 8, other states would follow and "fall into Satan's hands", and that following legalization of same-sex marriage, the advocates of the "[[gay agenda]]" would attempt to "legalize having sex with children".<ref name="pamd3"/> Chauncey connected these messages to the earlier history of government demonizing gays and lesbians which he had previously discussed.<ref name="pamd3"/> [[Helen Zia]], a scholar on [[Asian American]] social and political movements who was also asked to analyze those words, explained how her encounters with similar Asian community organizers encouraged her to "[step] into the closet and [slam] the door."<ref name="d5">{{cite news | url=http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/same-sex-marriage-case-day-5-raising-children/ | title=Same-Sex Marriage Case, Day 5: Children | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | date=2010-01-15 | accessdate=2010-01-25 | first=Gerry | last=Shih}}</ref> David Thompson for the defense cross-examined Prof. Chauncey by focusing on the progress that had been made for mainstream acceptance of gays and lesbians in the last twenty years.<ref name="pamd3">{{citeweb | url=http://www.pamshouseblend.com/diary/14828/shannon-minter-perry-v-schwarzenegger-proceedings-day-3 | title=Perry v.

Professor Gary Segura, a political scientist at [[Stanford University]], said that no other minority groups in America&nbsp;<U+2014> including undocumented aliens&nbsp;<U+2014> have been the target of more restrictive ballot initiatives than gay men and lesbians.<ref name="d7">{{cite news | url=http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/same-sex-marriage-case-day-7-choice/ | title=Same-Sex Marriage Case, Day 7: Choice | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | date=2010-01-20 | accessdate=2010-01-25 | first=Michelle | last=Quinn}}</ref> He accused Proposition 8 of being the type of social stigma that makes "gay and lesbian social progress seem like it comes at expense of other people and organizations and it makes the hill steeper".<ref name="d8">{{cite news | url=http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/same-sex-marriage-case-day-8-power-and-prejudice/ | title=Same-Sex Marriage Case, Day 8: Power and Prejudice | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | date=2010-01-21 | author=Quinn, Michelle | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> Under cross-examination, defendant witness [[David Blankenhorn]] revealed that he believed the principle of equal human dignity applied to gay and lesbian Americans, and that "we would be more American on the day we permitted same-sex marriage than we were on the day before".<ref name="blakenhorn"/>

[[Gregory M. Herek|Gregory Herek]], a professor from [[University of California at Davis|UC Davis]] contended that "structural stigma" in the form of laws like Proposition 8 directly encourages social stigma, harassment, and violence against LGBT people. He also testified that there is no evidence "[[conversion therapy]]" is effective in changing a person's sexuality, and that it "sends a harmful and false message to young people that homosexuality is a disorder", directly leading to more discrimination. During cross-examination, he asserted that "sexual orientation is a combination of attraction, identity, and behavior, and that the complexities researchers face in defining sexual orientation are no different than those they face in defining other characteristics such as race".<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/site/?q=node/7378 | title=Perry v.

=== Psychological effects ===
Relationship psychologist Anne Peplau took the stand and argued that individuals gain physical, psychological, and social benefits from being married.<ref name="pamd3"/> Edmund A. Egan, the chief economist for San Francisco, agreed and said that the citizen's improved health would save city emergency health funds.<ref name="pamd3"/> Anne Peplau also argued that the quality and stability of same-sex relationships are similar to those of heterosexual relationships and that permitting same-sex couples to marry will not harm the institution of marriage in any way.<ref name="pamd3"/> Peplau was cross-examined by Nicole Moss, who asked Peplau about the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships, but Peplau reiterated there are no significant differences.<ref name="pamd3"/> The plaintiffs also called forward Doctor Ilan H. Meyer to testify on the mental and psychological harms of being denied the right to marry. "Young children do not aspire to be domestic partners, marriage is a common, socially approved goal." He continued to say that gays and lesbians suffered from "minority stress".<ref name="d4"/>

Examining the impact of same-sex marriage on children, the plaintiffs introduced [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]], a developmental psychologist at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He contended that there is a fairly substantial body of literature since the late 1970s that focuses specifically on the adjustment of children [[LGBT parenting|parented]] by gay men and lesbians which provides very good understanding of the factors that affect the adjustment of children being raised by gay and lesbian parents. This substantial body of evidence documents that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents. He noted that for significant number of these children, their adjustment would be promoted were their parents able to get married. He added that a field of developmental psychology came to the conclusion that what makes for an effective parent is the same both for a mother or a father, and that children do not need to have a masculine-behaving parent figure, a father, or feminine-behaving parent figure, a mother, in order to be well adjusted.<ref name="d5-transcript">{{cite web |title=''Perry v.

=== Economics ===
In an exploration on the economics of Proposition 8, the plaintiffs called forward Edmund A. Egan, the chief economist for San Francisco. He testified that same-sex marriage would aid the city because "married individuals tend to accumulate more wealth than single individuals" and that "married individuals are healthier on average and behave themselves in healthier ways than single individuals", saving the city from paying emergency room bills and insurance funds.<ref name="d4">{{cite news | url=http://bayarea.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/14/same-sex-marriage-case-day-4-economics/ | title=Same-Sex Marriage Case, Day 4: Economics | publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' | author=Wollan, Malia | date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> He also testified that San Francisco would make a large sum of instant revenue from same-sex marriage being legalized, citing Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]]'s decision to [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|legalize]] same-sex marriage in 2004.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://prop8trialtracker.com/2010/01/14/liveblogging-day-4-daily-summary/ | title=Liveblogging Day 4: Daily Summary | publisher=[[Courage Campaign]] | author=Rosen, Julia | date=2010-01-14 | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> He estimated that the city of San Francisco was losing out on $37.2 million in retail and hotel spending and $2.5 million in sales and hotel tax revenue each year.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB20001424052748704562504575022043511627722.html | title=Gay-Marriage Ban Comes at What Cost? | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | author=Tuna, Cari | date=2010-01-28 | accessdate=2010-01-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

San Francisco Attorney Therese Stewart noted in the closing arguments that the city itself was uniquely losing out on potential profits because Proposition 8 dissuaded gay tourists and their families from visiting the "cool, gray city of love" (as Walker referred to it) to get married.<ref name="closing"/> She also argued, through testimony by Ryan Kendall and Meyer, that the city was burdened with higher incidents of mental health disorders and the subsequent costs to the public health system.<ref name="closing"/>

=== Political strength ===
The defense called up Professor [[Kenneth P. Miller]] from [[Claremont McKenna College]] to testify that LGBT people had strong political and social support within California. He argued that all the major newspapers, [[Hollywood]], [[Silicon Valley]], and a majority of state politicians all strongly opposed Proposition 8.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14265947?nclick_check=1 | title=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_14265947?nclick_check=1 | publisher=''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' | author=Mintz, Howard | date=2010-01-25 | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

During cross-examination of [[George Chauncey]], the defense claimed that LGBT people have enjoyed increased political and social clout, with increased acceptance by society as exemplified by films such as ''Brokeback Mountain''. Chauncey also admitted that employers in California are required to ban discrimination.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/01/brokeback-mountain-becomes-issue-in-prop-8-hearing.html | title='Brokeback Mountain' becomes issue in Prop. 8 hearing | publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | author=Dolan, Maura | date=2010-01-13 | accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

Judge Walker heard closing arguments on June 16, 2010.<ref>[https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/ Perry et al v. Schwarzenegger et al]</ref><ref>McKinley, Jesse (2010-06-16) [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/us/17prop.html?hp "Closing Arguments in Trial on California Gay Marriage"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' Retrieved 2010-06-16.</ref>

On August 4, 2010, Walker announced his ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, overturning Proposition 8 based on the [[Due Process Clause|Due Process]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] Clauses of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution |U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Judge strikes down Prop. 8, allows gay marriage in California | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/08/prop8-gay-marriage.html | publisher=L.A. Times | accessdate=4 August 2010 | date=2010-08-04}}</ref> Walker concluded that California had no [[rational basis]] or vested interest in denying gays and lesbians marriage licenses:<ref name="opinion" /><blockquote>An initiative measure adopted by the voters deserves great respect. The considered views and opinions of even the most highly qualified scholars and experts seldom outweigh the determinations of the voters. When challenged, however, the voters<U+2019> determinations must find at least some support in evidence. This is especially so when those determinations enact into law classifications of persons. Conjecture, speculation and fears are not enough. Still less will the moral disapprobation of a group or class of citizens suffice, no matter how large the majority that shares that view. The evidence demonstrated beyond serious reckoning that Proposition 8 finds support only in such disapproval. As such, Proposition 8 is beyond the constitutional reach of the voters or their representatives.</blockquote> He further noted that Proposition 8 was based on traditional notions of opposite-sex marriage and on moral disapproval of homosexuality, neither of which is a legal basis for discrimination. He noted that gays and lesbians are exactly the type of minority that [[strict scrutiny]] was designed to protect.

==== Findings of Fact ====
Over 50 pages of the opinion are devoted to Walker's 80 [[findings of fact]]<ref>{{cite web | title=List of 80 Findings of Fact in Perry v. Schwarzenegger Decision | url=http://adellefrank.com/blog/review-summary-walker-eighty-findings-of-fact-perry-vs-schwarzenegger | publisher=Adelle Frank | date=2010-08-07}}</ref> and the supporting [[evidence (law)|evidence]]. These findings of fact are important because appellate courts generally [[Deference (law)|defer]] to them. Some of those findings include:
* Marriage is a civil, not religious, matter. (Finding of Fact (FF) #19, p.&nbsp;60)
* How the State defines civil marriage (FF #34, p.&nbsp;67)
* The benefits of civil marriage (to the State and individuals). (FF #35-41, pp.&nbsp;67-71)
* Sexual orientation refers to an enduring pattern of sexual, affectional or romantic desires for and attractions to men, women or both sexes. An individual<U+2019>s sexual orientation can be expressed through self-identification, behavior or attraction. (FF #43, pp.&nbsp;71-72)
* Individuals do not generally choose their sexual orientation. An individual does not, through conscious decision, therapeutic intervention or any other method, change sexual orientation. (FF #46, p.&nbsp;74)
* The State has no interest in asking gays and lesbians to change their orientation or in reducing the number of gays and lesbians in California. (FF #47, p.&nbsp;76)
* Marrying a person of the opposite sex is an unrealistic option for gays and lesbians. (FF #51, p.&nbsp;79)
* Domestic partnerships lack the social meaning associated with marriage. (FF #52, p.&nbsp;80)
* The costs and harm (to the State and to lesbians and gays) resulting from denial of marriage to same-sex couples. (FF #64-68, 77-78)
* A parent's gender is not a factor in a child's adjustment. An individual's sexual orientation does not determine whether that individual can be a good parent. Children raised by gay or lesbian parents are as likely as children raised by heterosexual parents to be healthy, successful and well-adjusted. (FF #70, p.&nbsp;95)
* Gays and lesbians have a long history of being victims of discrimination. (FF #74, p.&nbsp;96)
* Religious beliefs that gay and lesbian relationships are sinful or inferior to heterosexual relationships harm gays and lesbians. (FF #77, p.&nbsp;101)

==== Substantive due process ====
Judge Walker characterized the right at issue as simply "the right to marry", which, he opined, "has been historically and remains the right to choose a spouse and, with mutual consent, join together and form a household", citing ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.  He goes on to say that "[r]ace and gender restrictions shaped marriage during eras of race and gender inequality, but such restrictions were never part of the historical core of the institution of marriage".

Before analyzing Proposition 8 under the applicable level of review (strict scrutiny for fundamental rights), Walker noted that California's domestic partnership laws do not satisfy California's obligation to provide gays and lesbians the right to marry, for two reasons: (1) domestic partnerships do not provide the same social meaning as marriage; and (2) domestic partnerships were created "specifically so that California could offer same-sex couples rights and benefits while explicitly withholding marriage from same-sex couples."

Judge Walker then found Proposition 8 unconstitutional because it does not pass even a rational-basis review (as he explains in the Equal Protection context), much less strict scrutiny.

=== Evaluation of expert witnesses ===

The court found that all nine of the witnesses presented by the plaintiffs as experts "were amply qualified to offer opinion testimony on the subjects identified" and "offered credible opinion testimony on the subjects identified."<ref name=opinion>[https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf Walker's Ruling]</ref> The defense proffered two witnesses as experts. David Blankenhorn, who had been allowed to testify, was ultimately judged as lacking "the qualifications to offer opinion testimony".<ref name=opinion /> The court found that Kenneth P. Miller's "opinions on gay and lesbian political power are entitled to little weight and only to the extent they are amply supported by reliable evidence."<ref name=opinion />

=== Legal analysis of the decision ===
Professor Doug NeJaime of [[Loyola Law School]] noted that Judge Walker's decision was crafted similarly to the standard used by Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]] in his decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', and suggested that Walker was "speaking" to Kennedy, who is commonly the swing vote on the Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/us/06assess.html | title=In Same-Sex Ruling, an Eye on the Supreme Court | author=Schwartz, John | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=2010-08-04 | accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> [[John Eastman]], a law professor who supported Proposition 8, agreed with Professor NeJaime's assessment. Barry McDonald, a constitutional law professor at [[Pepperdine University]], believed that Walker's strict handling of the case and meticulous evidence gathering would "make it more difficult for appellate courts to overturn this court's ruling."<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gay-marriage-california-20100805,0,3014822,full.story | title=Ruling against Prop. 8 could lead to federal precedent on gay marriage | author=Williams, Carol J. | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2010-08-04 | accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref>

"Only a trial court [like Walker's] can make factual findings," lawyer Brian DeVine said in an analysis. He further noted that "a Court of Appeal must give great deference to the factual findings of the trial court", and praised Walker "for carefully and diligently going through the facts of the case, creating a detailed and compelling record for the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ontopmag.com/article.aspx?id=6166&MediaType=1&Category=26|title=Gay Marriage Supporters Say Prop 8 Ruling Hard To Overturn|publisher=OnTopMagazine|date=2010-08-05|author=Santoscoy, Carlos|accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> [[Andrew Cohen]], [[CBS]]'s legal analyst, questioned the defense team's decision to "cede so much ground at trial to their opponents" and called "inconceivable" their gamble that the conservative Supreme Court might "save the day". He praised Judge Walker's handling of the case, especially in respect to the defendant-intervenors. "During the trial, Walker practically begged and cajoled the Prop 8 lawyers to do better for their cause. He asked them written questions to draw them out. He scolded them during closing arguments to make more persuasive arguments. They simply didn't or couldn't or wouldn't respond."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/08/04/the-prop-8-ruling-same-sex-marriage-wins-a-sweeping-legal-victo/|title=The Prop 8 Ruling: Same-Sex Marriage Wins a Sweeping Legal Victory|publisher=Politics Daily|author=Cohen, Andrew|date=2010-08-06|accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> Lea Brilmayer, a law professor from [[Yale University]], suggested that the perceived slant of the trial evidence and the decision resulted from "[Prop 8] supporters' sorry lawyering".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/06/AR2010080605222.html|title=Impact of same-sex marriage|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|author=Brilmayer, Lea|date=2010-08-07|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> [[Vikram Amar]], a law professor from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] argued that the defendant's decision to not put up a case may help them in the long run by arguing in higher courts that the evidence was irrelevant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/08/MNPM1EQ0IP.DTL&tsp=1|title=Prop. 8 trial frames debate on marital rights|author=Egelko, Bob|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2010-08-08|accessdate=2010-08-08}}</ref>

The religious rights law firm [[Liberty Counsel]], which has litigated opposition to same-sex marriage in California since 2004, criticized [[Alliance Defense Fund]]'s handling of the case. "ADF presented only two witnesses at trial, following the 15 witnesses presented by those who challenged Proposition 8. Even Judge Walker commented that he was concerned by the lack of evidence presented by ADF on behalf of Prop 8."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lc.org/index.cfm?PID=14100&PRID=960|title=California Judge Strikes Down Prop 8 Marriage Amendment|publisher=[[Liberty Counsel]]|date=2010-08-04|accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref>

[[M. Edward Whelan III|Ed Whelan]], President of the conservative [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]] and a former lawyer in the [[George W. Bush]] administration, criticized the ruling as being based on the judge's subjective and unsubstantiated views of current societal mores rather than on a neutral interpretation of the law. Whelan criticized in particular Judge Walker's repeated contention that certain facts about society were "beyond any doubt" or "beyond debate," such as Walker's contentions that same-sex parenting has been shown to be equally effective as opposite-sex parenting or that allowing same-sex couples to marry would not in any way negatively affect the rights of opponents of same-sex marriage. Whelan believes those points are in fact hotly contested in our society.<ref>{{Cite web

California's elected officials generally also responded positively to the ruling.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]  commented: "this decision represents only the opening of a vigorous debate over the rights of the people to define and protect this most fundamental institution <U+2013> marriage..." The [[Roman Catholic bishop]]s of California stated: "...the courts do not have the right to distort the meaning of marriage".<ref>{{cite news |first=Cathy Lynn |last=Grossman |title=Prop 8 ruling drives strong religious reactions: Outrage to joy |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/08/prop-8-proposition-8-california-gay-marriage-vaugh-walker/1?csp=34 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2010-08-04 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> [[National Organization for Marriage]] (NOM) chairman [[Maggie Gallagher]] also disagreed with the ruling.
