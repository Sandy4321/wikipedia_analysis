The '''World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theory''' is a [[conspiracy theory]] which contends that the [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] was not caused by the airliner crash damage that occurred as part of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], nor by resulting fire damage, but by [[explosive]]s installed in the buildings in advance.<ref name="Clarke">Clarke, Steve. "Conspiracy Theories and the Internet: Controlled Demolition and Arrested Development". ''Episteme'', Volume 4, Issue 2, 2007, pp. 167-180.</ref>

Early on, advocates such as physicist [[Steven E. Jones]], architect [[Richard Gage (architect)|Richard Gage]], software engineer [[Jim Hoffman]], and theologian [[David Ray Griffin]], argued that the aircraft impacts and resulting fires could not have weakened the buildings sufficiently to initiate a [[Structural failure|catastrophic collapse]], and that the buildings would not have collapsed completely, nor at the speeds that they did, without additional energy involved to weaken their structures.

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) and the magazine ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' examined and rejected these theories.  Specialists in [[structural mechanics]] and [[structural engineering]] generally accept the model of a fire-induced, gravity-driven collapse of the World Trade Center buildings, an explanation that does not involve the use of explosives.<ref name="bazant07">{{Cite journal | last=Ba<U+017E>ant | first=Zden<U+011B>k P. | coauthors=Mathieu Verdure | authorlink=Zden<U+011B>k Ba<U+017E>ant | title=Mechanics of Progressive Collapse: Learning from World Trade Center and Building Demolitions | year=2007 | month=March | journal=J Engrg Mech | volume=133 | issue=3 | pages=308<U+2013>319 | doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(2007)133:3(308) | url=http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf | accessdate=2007-08-22 | quote=As generally accepted by the community of specialists in structural mechanics and structural engineering (though not by a few outsiders claiming a conspiracy with planted explosives), the failure scenario was as follows [...] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070809030224/http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/466.pdf  |archivedate = 2007-08-09}}</ref><ref name="Chronicle" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asquith|first=Christina|date=2006-09-07|title=Conspiracies continue to abound surrounding 9/11: on the eve of the fifth anniversary, a group of professors say the attacks were an "inside job."|journal=Diverse Issues in Higher Education|page=12|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WMX/is_15_23/ai_n27000635/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> NIST did not test for explosive compound residue in steel samples, stating the potential for inconclusive results, and noting that similar compounds would have been present during construction of the towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm |title=NIST's Investigation of the Sept. 11 World Trade Center Disaster |publisher=NIST |date=August, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5pvOUTcar | archivedate = 2010-05-22| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Physicist [[Steven E. Jones]], among others, points to many descriptions by individuals working on the WTC rubble pile suggesting the presence of molten steel in the pile<ref name="NYTCountersTheories" /><ref name="ActiveThermitic"/> and a stream of molten metal that poured out of the South Tower before it collapsed<ref name="Chronicle" /> as evidence of temperatures beyond those produced by the fire. Jones has argued that the molten metal may have been [[iron|elemental iron]], a product of a thermite reaction. Jones and other researchers analyzed samples of dust from the World Trade Center buildings and reported their findings for evidence of [[nano-thermite]] in the dust.<ref name="ActiveThermitic" /> Jones informed NIST of his findings and NIST responded that there was no "clear chain of custody" proving that the dust indeed came from the WTC site. Jones invited NIST to conduct its own studies with dust under custody of NIST itself, but NIST has not done so.<ref name="SBIndependent">{{Cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Jay|last2=McKenzie|first2=Tom|title=The Elements of a Great Scientific and Technical Dispute|journal=Santa Barbara Independent|date=September 17, 2009|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2009/sep/17/elements-great-scientific-and-technical-dispute/|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref>

NIST found that the condition of the steel in the wreckage of the towers does not provide conclusive information on the condition of the building before the collapse and concluded that the material coming from the South Tower was molten [[aluminum]] from the plane, which would have melted at lower temperatures than steel. NIST also pointed out that cutting through the vertical columns would require planting an enormous amount of explosives inconspicuously in highly secured buildings, then igniting it remotely while keeping it in contact with the columns.<ref name="nistfaq" /> A test performed by the [[Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center]] showed that conventional thermite was unable to melt a column much smaller than those used in the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/9-11-science-and-conspiracy-4067/conspiracy-vs-science|title=9/11: Science and Conspiracy|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref>  Jones and others have responded that they do not believe that thermite was used, but rather a form of thermite called [[nano-thermite]], a nanoenergetic material which developed for military use, propellants, explosives, or pyrotechnics.  Historically, explosive applications for traditional thermites have been limited by their relatively slow energy release rates.  But because nano-thermites are created from reactant particles with proximities approaching the atomic scale, energy release rates are far improved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/index/780214180.pdf |title=Effect of Al particle size on the thermal degradation of Al/teflon mixtures |publisher=Informaworld.com |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>

The NIST report provides an analysis of the structural response of the building only up to the point where collapse begins, and asserts that the enormous [[kinetic energy]] transferred by the falling part of the building makes [[progressive collapse]] inevitable once an initial collapse occurs. A paper by [[Zden<U+011B>k Ba<U+017E>ant]] indicates that once collapse began, the kinetic energy imparted by a falling upper section onto the floor below was an order of magnitude greater than that which the lower section could support.<ref name="bazant07"/>

Engineers who have investigated the collapses generally disagree that controlled demolition is required to understand the structural response of the buildings. While the top of one of the towers did tilt significantly, it could not ultimately have fallen into the street, they argue, because any such tilting would place sufficient stress on the lower story (acting as a pivot) that it would collapse long before the top had sufficiently shifted its center of gravity. Indeed, they argue, there is very little difference between progressive collapse with or without explosives in terms of the resistance that the structures could provide after collapse began.<ref name="bazant07"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/wtc/collapse.html |title=NOVA &#124; Building on Ground Zero &#124; PBS |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2008-10-30|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110515204603/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/wtc/collapse.html |archivedate = May 15, 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Controlled demolition of a building to [[Building code|code]] requires weeks of preparation, including laying large quantities of explosive and cutting through beams, which would have rendered the building highly dangerous and which would have to be done without attracting the attention of the thousands of people who worked in the building.<ref name="NYTCountersTheories" /><ref name="Wilkinson">{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.usyd.edu.au/wtc.shtml|title=World Trade Center - Some Engineering Aspects|last=Wilkinson|first=Tim|date=2006-01-14|publisher=University of Sydney School of Civil Engineering|accessdate=2008-09-07}}</ref> Controlled demolition is traditionally done from the bottom of buildings rather than the top, although there are exceptions depending on structural design.

===7 World Trade Center===

Proponents of World Trade Center controlled demolition theories allege that [[7 World Trade Center]] -- a 47-story skyscraper that stood across Vesey Street north of the main part of the [[World Trade Center site]] -- was intentionally destroyed with explosives.  Unlike the Twin Towers, 7 World Trade Center was not hit by a plane, although it was hit by debris from the Twin Towers and was damaged by fires which burned for seven hours, until it collapsed totally at about 5:20&nbsp;p.m. on the evening of September 11 (a new building has been erected on the site of the old and opened in May 2006).  Several videos of the collapse event exist in the public domain, thus enabling comparative analysis from different angles of perspective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtc7.net/videos.html |title=Videos Show Building 7's Vertical Collapse |work=wtc7.net |accessdate=2011-07-30}}</ref> Proponents typically say the collapse of 7 World Trade Center was not mentioned in the [[9/11 Commission Report]] and that the federal body charged with investigating the event, [[NIST]], required seven years to conduct its investigation and issue a report.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rememberbuilding7.org/7-facts-about-building-7/ |title=7 Facts about Building 7 |work=rememberbuilding7.org |accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref>

In November 2010, [[Fox News]] reporter [[Geraldo Rivera]] hosted members of a television ad campaign called "BuildingWhat?", a series of commercials in which 9/11 family members ask questions about [[7 World Trade Center]] and call for an investigation into its collapse.  Rivera called the television ads "not so easy to dismiss as those demonstrators were," and stated that, "If explosives were involved, that would mean the most obnoxious protesters in recent years ... were right."<ref>{{cite news|last=Webster|first=Stephen C.|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/11/14/geraldo-much-open-minded-911-campaign/ |title=Geraldo <U+2018>much more open minded<U+2019> about 9/11 thanks to NYC television ads |accessdate=2011-07-27 |journal=The Raw Story |date=November 14, 2010 }}</ref> Days later, Rivera appeared on the program [[Freedom Watch]] with legal analyst Judge [[Andrew Napolitano]] on the [[Fox Business Network]] to discuss the BuildingWhat?

Some proponents of World Trade Center controlled demolition theories suggest that 7 WTC was demolished because it may have served as an operational center for the demolition of the Twin Towers, while others suggest that government insiders may have wanted to destroy key files held in the building pertaining to corporate fraud.  The WTC buildings housed dozens of federal, state and local government agencies.<ref name="SALAZAR">{{cite news |first=CRISTIAN |last=SALAZAR |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/07/30/3805375/mystery-surrounds-loss-of-records.html |title=Mystery surrounds loss of records, art on 9/11 |accessdate=2011-07-30 |agency=Associated Press |date=July 30, 2011}} {{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> According to a statement reported by the [[BBC]], [[Loose Change]] film producer [[Dylan Avery]] thinks the destruction of the building was suspicious because it housed some unusual tenants, including a clandestine CIA office on the 25th floor, an outpost of the U.S. Secret Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and New York City's emergency command center.<ref name="SALAZAR"/> The former chief counter-terrorism adviser to the President, [[Richard A.

In 2009 a paper by nine scientists described their discovery and chemical and physical analysis of small "red/gray chips in all the samples we have studied of the dust produced by the destruction of the World Trade Center," which were collected at four separate sites. Such chips "have apparently not been discussed in previously published reports. It is worth emphasizing that one sample was collected about ten minutes after the collapse of the second Tower, so it cannot possibly have been contaminated by clean-up operations."

Earlier, in 2006, Professor [[Steven E.

====NIST Report====
In 2002, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began a general investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center but soon made a decision to focus first on the collapse of the Twin Towers.<ref name="7FAQ"/> A draft version of its final report on the collapse of 7&nbsp;WTC was released in August 2008. The agency has blamed the slowness of this investigation on the complexity of the computer model it used, which simulated the collapse from the moment it begins all the way to the ground; and NIST says the time taken on the investigation into 7&nbsp;WTC is comparable to the time taken to investigate an aircraft crash.<ref name="7FAQ"/> The agency also says another 80 boxes of documents related to 7&nbsp;WTC were found and had to be analyzed. These delays fueled suspicion the agency was struggling to come up with a plausible conclusion.<ref name="FTpt3">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a580372-342b-11dd-869b-0000779fd2ac.html |title=The Truth Is Out There - Part III |last=Barber |first=Peter |date=2008-06-07 |publisher=Financial Times |page=14 |accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

NIST released its final report on the collapse of 7 World Trade Center on November 20, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm |title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 |date=November 2008 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref> Investigators used videos, photographs and building design documents to come to their conclusions. The investigation could not include physical evidence as the materials from the building lacked characteristics allowing them to be positively identified and were therefore disposed of prior to the initiation of the investigation.<ref name="7FAQ" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm |title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 |date=November 2008 |publisher=NIST |accessdate=2010-04-26 |page=15}}</ref> The report concluded that the building's collapse was due to the effects of the fires which burned for almost seven hours. The fatal blow to the building came when the 13th floor collapsed, weakening a critical steel support column that led to catastrophic failure, and extreme heat caused some steel beams to lose strength, causing further failures throughout the buildings until the entire structure succumbed. Also cited as a factor was the collapse of the nearby towers, which broke the city water main, leaving the sprinkler system in the bottom half of the building without water.

NIST considered the possibility that 7&nbsp;WTC was brought down with explosives and concluded that a blast event did not occur, that the "use of thermite [...] to sever columns in 7&nbsp;WTC on 9/11/01 was unlikely".<ref name="7FAQ" /> The investigation cited as evidence the claim that no blast was audible on recordings of the collapse and that no blast was reported by witnesses, stating that it would have been audible at a level of 130-140 decibels at a distance of half a mile. Demolition proponents say eyewitnesses repeatedly reported explosions happening before the collapse of the towers, and have published videos obtained from NIST, together with indications about when such explosions could be heard in support of the sounds of explosions before collapse.<ref name="Bild Videos"/>

NIST also concluded that it is unlikely that the quantities of thermite needed could have been carried into the building undetected. Demolition advocates have responded that they do not claim that thermite was used, but rather [[nano-thermite]], far more powerful than thermite, was used.  Finally, the theory that fires from the large amount of diesel fuel stored in the building caused the collapse was also investigated and ruled out.<ref name="7FAQ" />

==Reactions==
The structural engineering community rejects the controlled-demolition conspiracy theory.  Its consensus is that the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings was a fire-induced, gravity-driven collapse, an explanation that does not involve the use of explosives.<ref name="bazant07"/><ref>[[9/11 Commission Report]]</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

The [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] Structural Engineering Institute issued a statement calling for further discussion of NIST's recommendations,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Government_Relations_-_New/writtentestimony102605.pdf | title = Testimony of Dr.James Harris, PhD, P.E. | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | date = October 26, 2005 | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers}}</ref> and Britain's [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] published a statement in May 2002 welcoming the FEMA report, noting that the report expressed similar views to those held by its group of professionals.<ref>http://www.istructe.org/thestructuralengineer/files/se/se102002.pdf</ref>

Following the publication of Jones' paper "Why Indeed Did the WTC Buildings Completely Collapse?"<ref name="NYTCountersTheories"/> [[Brigham Young University]] responded to Jones' "increasingly speculative and accusatory" statements by placing him on paid leave, and thereby stripping him of two classes, in September 2006, pending a review of his statements and research. Six weeks later, Jones retired<!--Just in case anyone thinks of reintroducing the word "resigned" here: This would be a factually incorrect description of the ongoing relationship of BYU and Prof. Jones, see Jones' website at BYU.--> from the university.<ref name="Walch"/> The structural engineering faculty at the university issued a statement which said that they "do not support the hypotheses of Professor Jones".<ref name="Chronicle" /><ref name="McIlvain"/> On September 22, 2005, Jones gave a seminar on his hypotheses to a group of his colleagues from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at BYU. According to Jones, all but one of his colleagues agreed after the seminar that an investigation was in order and the lone dissenter came to agreement with Jones' suggestions the next day.<ref name="McIlvain"/>

[[Northwestern University]] Professor of [[Civil Engineering]] Zden<U+011B>k Ba<U+017E>ant, who was the first to offer a published peer-reviewed theory of the collapses, wrote "a few outsiders claiming a conspiracy with planted explosives" as an exception.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i42/42a01001.htm Professors of Paranoia? - Faculty - The Chronicle of Higher Education]</ref> Ba<U+017E>ant and Verdure trace such "strange ideas" to a "mistaken impression" that safety margins in design would make the collapses impossible. One of the effects of a more detailed modeling of the progressive collapse, they say, could be to "dispel the myth of planted explosives". Indeed, Ba<U+017E>ant and Verdure have proposed examining data from controlled demolitions in order to better model the progressive collapse of the towers, suggesting that progressive collapse and controlled demolition are not two separate modes of failure (as the controlled-demolition conspiracy theory assumes).<ref name="bazant07"/>

Thomas Eagar, a professor of materials science and engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], also dismissed the controlled-demolition conspiracy theory.<ref name="Chronicle">{{cite web|last = Gravois |first = John | date = June 23, 2006 | url = http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i42/42a01001.htm |title = Professors of Paranoia?

World Trade Center developer Larry Silverstein said, "Hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9/11 conspiracy theories, which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day." Upon presentation of the NIST's detailed report on the failure of Bldg. 7, Richard Gage, leader of the group ''[[Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth]]'' said, "How much longer do we have to endure the coverup of how Building 7 was destroyed?" in which Dr. S. Shyam Sunder, the lead NIST investigator said he could not explain why the skepticism would not die. <U+201C>I am really not a psychologist,<U+201D> he said. <U+201C>Our job was to come up with the best science.<U+201D><ref name="NYT-Lipton-2008"/> 
James Quintiere, professor of [[fire protection engineering]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], who does not believe explosives brought down the towers, questioned how the agency came to its conclusions, remarking, "They don't have the expertise on explosives," though he adds that NIST wasted time employing outside experts to consider it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/22/september11.usa |title=World Trade Centre building seven not destroyed by explosives, says US study |accessdate=2009-04-24 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=August 22, 2008 |first=McClatchy |last=Newspapers}}</ref>
