O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show ''[[Star Search]]''. A TV [[sitcom]] and a series of movies introduced the comic to a wider audience and in 1996 she started hosting ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' which won multiple Emmy awards. 

During her years on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' she wrote her first book, a [[memoir]] called ''[[Find Me]]'' and developed a reputation for being "the queen of nice" as well as a reputation for charitable philanthropy. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her own [[For All Kids]] foundation and promoted numerous other charity schemes and projects encouraging other celebrities on her show to also take part. O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]] stating "I'm a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]]!" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to [[gay adoption]] issues.<ref name = "USAtoday-coy Rosie"/> O'Donnell is a [[foster care|foster]]<U+2014>and [[adoption|adoptive]]<U+2014>mother. She has since continued to support many [[LGBT]] causes and issues.

In 2006 O'Donnell became the new [[moderator]] on ''[[The View]]'' boosting ratings and attracting controversies with her [[Liberalism|liberal]] views and strong personality, dominating many of the conversations. She became a polarizing figure to many [[conservative]]s and her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies including an on-air dispute regarding [[Presidency of George W. Bush|The Bush administration]]'s policies with the [[war in Iraq]] resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007 O'Donnell also released her second memoir, ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at ''The View''. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues.

On October 22, 2008, [[TV Guide]] reported that O<U+2019>Donnell will star in and executive produce a new [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]] original movie called <U+2018><U+2019>America<U+2019><U+2019>, in which she plays the therapist of the title character, a 16-year-old boy in the foster-care system. The film is based on the [[E.R.

==Early career==
===Stand-up/club comedian===
O'Donnell toured stand-up clubs from 1979 to 1984.<ref>[http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=c967a0ca-63f1-4edb-b3c6-ec4bdbbc0c4a Rosie O'Donnell profile], ''E!

And about three days later, the talent booker from ''Star Search'' called and said, we're going to fly you out to L.A. [...] I won, like, five weeks in a row. And it gave me national exposure.}}

===TV career begins===
[[Image:RosieODonnell.jpg|thumb|O'Donnell at the [[Emmy Awards]] in 1992.]]
After this success, she moved on to television sitcom comedy, making her series debut as [[Nell Carter]]'s neighbor on ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'' in 1986.

In 1988, she transferred to [[VH1]], where she hosted ''[[Stand-up Spotlight]]'', a showcase for up-and-coming comedians. In 1992 she starred in ''[[Stand By Your Man (TV Series)|Stand By Your Man]]'', a [[Fox Network]] sitcom co-starring [[Melissa Gilbert]]. The show bombed, just as O'Donnell's movie career took off.

==Movie career==
O'Donnell made her feature film debut in ''[[A League Of Their Own]]'' alongside [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name="actors"/> Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' as [[Meg Ryan]]'s best friend; as [[Betty Rubble]] in the live-action film adaptation of [[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]] with [[John Goodman]]; as one of  [[Timothy Hutton]]'s co-stars in ''[[Beautiful Girls]]''; as a federal agent comedically paired with [[Dan Aykroyd]] in ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]''; as the voice of female gorilla in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Tarzan]]''; and as  a baseball-loving nun in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]''.

==''The Rosie O'Donnell Show''==
{{Main|The Rosie O'Donnell Show}}
In 1996, she began hosting a [[daytime TV|daytime]] talk show, ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show''. The show proved extremely successful, winning multiple [[Emmy]] awards, and earning O'Donnell the title of "The Queen of Nice" for her style of light-hearted banter with her guests and interactions with the audience. As part of her playful banter with her studio audience, O'Donnell often launched [[koosh balls]] at the crowd and camera.<ref>[http://www.tvacres.com/props_balls_koosh.htm "Balls & Spheres"], ''TV Acres''</ref>  She also professed an infatuation with [[Tom Cruise]].

With [[New York City]] as the show's homebase, O'Donnell displayed her love of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musicals]] and [[Play (theatre)|plays]] by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket give-aways. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who helped the city rebound by encouraging viewers to visit and support the [[performing arts]]. She announced that she would donate $1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to "give till it hurts".

In 2002, she left her talk show. The show was then replaced by ''[[The Caroline Rhea Show]]'', with comedian [[Caroline Rhea]] and ran for one additional season.

===Gun control controversies===
After the [[Columbine shootings]], O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of [[gun control]] and a major figure in the [[Million Mom March]].<ref name="Amy Paulson">{{cite web

On [[May 19]], [[1999]], a month after the [[Columbine shootings]], O'Donnell interviewed actor [[Tom Selleck]], who was promoting a film ''[[The Love Letter]]''. After a commercial break, O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the [[National Rifle Association]] and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [[assault rifles]]. According to Selleck, the two had agreed not to discuss the topic prior to his appearance on the show.<ref name="Tom Selleck News">{{cite web

Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with [[Sears Holdings Corporation|Kmart]] as their spokeswoman as gun enthusiasts complained that she shouldn't be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that "Kmart is, in fact, a seller of hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons. Such sales are not illegal or immoral in any way when they are conducted ... with background checks and safety locks available."<ref name="Movie/TV News - O'Donnell Fires Back"/> Kmart employees told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' that it was Kmart who terminated the agreement with O'Donnell, which both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly.<ref>New York Daily News, November 19, 1999 "Rosie Sticks to Her Guns By Unloading Kmart Gig" by Mitchell Fink</ref>

In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed firearm permit]] in [[Connecticut]]. O'Donnell stated that it was not she who requested the permit, but [[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]], the security firm through which the guard was hired and was contracted by O'Donnell's employer [[Warner Brothers]]. Numerous parents of children who attended the same school as O'Donnell's children expressed their concern about the possibility of O'Donnell's bodyguard being armed while on school grounds. O'Donnell confirmed "the guard does not normally have a gun, but is trained in self-defense techniques. And there was never any intention of his carrying a gun at school." O'Donnell added that because of threats, she and her family need protection, which she attributes, ironically, to her "tough gun-control rhetoric".<ref name="J.A. Johnson Jr.">{{cite web

==Charitable works==
===Charitable book deal===
In May 1996, [[Warner Books]] advanced O'Donnell $3 million to write a [[memoir]]. She used the money to seed her [[For All Kids]] foundation to help institute national standards for day care across the country. Her memoir, ''[[Find Me]]'', was released in April 2002 and became the second highest on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]].<ref>{{cite web | year=2007| title= Rosie O'Donnell: Biography

===Listerine charity kissing===
[[San Francisco]] [[public relations]] firm Fineman Associates awarded top prize to [[Procter & Gamble]] Co.'s designation of O'Donnell as "unkissable" in a [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] for its [[Scope (mouthwash)|Scope]] mouthwash on the 1997 annual list of the nation's worst public relations blunders.<ref>{{cite web | year=1997| title= P&G wins top `PR blunder' honor | work=Bizjournals | url=http://cincinnati.bizjournals.com/site_map/cincinnati_sitemap_18.html |  accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> In response to the promotion, the "unkissable" O'Donnell partnered with [[Warner Lambert]]'s competitor [[Listerine]] who donated bottles of mouthwash to the studio audience and donated $1,000 to charity every time a hosted guest would kiss her in exchange for O'Donnell promoting their product. On occasion, the guests would offer multiple kisses and [[People magazine|''People'']] reported O'Donnell "smooched her way to more than $350,000."<ref>{{cite web | year=2007| title= Rosie O'Donnell: Five Fun Facts | work=People | url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell |  accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

On [[May 18]], [[2007]], O'Donnell and Pogo Games announced a joint-effort to raise money for Rosie's All Kids Foundation. EA, which owns Pogo, committed $30,000 and more money can be raised based on the amount of playing time people spend on certain games. They are also holding a sweepstakes in which winners get to fly to New York and meet Rosie and attend a charity function as her guest.

==''Rosie'' magazine==
{{Main|Rosie (magazine)}}
In 2000, O'Donnell partnered with the publishers of ''[[McCall's]]'' to revamp the magazine as ''Rosie's McCall's'' (or, more commonly, ''Rosie''). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s monthly magazine. ''Rosie'' covered issues including  [[breast cancer]], [[foster care]] and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue she shared that "she has struggled with [[Clinical depression|depression]] her entire life" and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family.<ref name="Depression">{{cite web

With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with [[publisher]] Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002 following a dispute over [[editorial]] control. "If I'm going to have my name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" she told People.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/biography/0,,20033874_10,00.html The End of 'Rosie' Mag, Rosie O'Donnell: Biography 2007]</ref> Rosie magazine folded in 2003.

In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for [[breach of contract]]. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The [[trial]] received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie "get sick and they get [[cancer]]. If they keep lying, they get it again".<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/06/rosie.magazine.suit.ap/index.html Cancer survivor: Rosie O'Donnell told her liars 'get cancer']</ref> O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." The judge ruled against both sides and dismissed the case.

In 2006, O'Donnell responded to a question on the "Ask Ro" section of her website in which she stated that she would love to do another magazine. In addition, O'Donnell has written a new book, ''Celebrity Detox'', which was released on [[October 9]], [[2007]].

==Books==
In 2002, O'Donnell wrote ''[[Find Me]],'' a combination of memoir, mystery and detective story with an underlying interest in re-uniting birth mothers with their children. In addition to cataloguing her childhood and early adulthood, the book delved into O'Donnell's relationship with a woman with [[multiple personality disorder]] who posed as an under-aged teen who had become [[pregnant]] by [[rape]]. The book reached number two on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.

On [[October 9]], [[2007]], O'Donnell released ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', her second memoir which focuses on the struggles with leaving fame behind, noting her exits from ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and ''[[The View]]''.

In her [[January 31]], [[2002]], appearance on the [[sitcom]] ''[[Will & Grace]]'', she played a [[lesbian]] mom. A month later as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at [[Caroline's Comedy Club]] O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]] as a [[lesbian]], announcing "I'm a [[Dyke (lesbian)|dyke]]!" "I don't know why people make such a big deal about the [[gay]] thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody."<ref name = "USAtoday-coy Rosie">{{cite web | year=2002| title= Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage| work=USA Today, Jeannie Williams | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> The announcement came two months before the end of the hosting of her talk show. 

Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians her primary reason was to bring attention to the [[gay adoption]] issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in [[Florida]], that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.

[[Diane Sawyer]] interviewed O'Donnell in a [[March 14]], [[2002]], episode of ''[[Primetime (TV series)|PrimeTime Thursday]]'', telling ''[[USA Today]]'' she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, "I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me." She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who face having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law won't let them adopt because Florida bans [[gay]] or [[bisexual]] people from adopting.<ref name = "USAtoday-coy Rosie"/>

O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of [[Tom Cruise]] on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' as deceptive.<ref name = "USAtoday-coy Rosie"/> She responded in her act stating, "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted (to perform a sex act on him)."<ref name = "USAtoday-coy Rosie"/>

==''Taboo''==
After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former [[Culture Club]] backup singer [[Helen Terry]].<ref>[http://hollywood.outsidethebeltway.com/category/notables/rosie-odonnell/ Rosie O<U+2019>Donnell May Leave <U+2018>The View<U+2019> Early, By Allie @ Gone Hollywood]</ref> She subsequently attributed the haircut as a way to emulate [[Boy George]], in hopes that he would allow her to produce his stage show ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]''. O'Donnell did invest in and produce the show, but it was an expensive failure on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Family life==
===Marriage===
On [[February 26]], [[2004]], O'Donnell married [[Kelli Carpenter-O'Donnell|Kelli Carpenter]], a former [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] marketing executive, in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] two weeks after SF's Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] authorized the granting of marriage licenses to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]. Her decision to go to San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against [[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] over his support for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. {{Quote|"We were both inspired to come here after the sitting president made the vile and hateful comments he made...

===Family===
The couple are parents to adopted children Parker Jaren (born [[May 25]], [[1995]]), Chelsea Belle (born [[September 20]], [[1997]]), and Blake Christopher (born [[December 5]], [[1999]]). Their fourth child, Vivienne Rose (who was conceived through [[artificial insemination]]), was born [[November 29]], [[2002]] to Carpenter. In 2000 the family took in a foster child Mia (born in 1997), and announced intentions to adopt her. In 2001 the state of Florida removed Mia from their home, and Rosie has since worked extensively to bring an end to the [[Florida]] law prohibiting same-sex family adoption.<ref> [http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Rosie_ODonnell/189622 Hollywood.com Biography] </ref><ref> [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/06/lklw.00.html CNN.com transcript of ''Larry King Live'' Interview of O'Donnell] </ref>

==''The View''==

In September 2006 O'Donnell replaced [[Meredith Vieira]] as a co-host and moderator of the daytime women-oriented daytime talkshow ''[[The View]]''. [[Star Jones]], a co-host on the show, quit with some speculating Jones's [[conservative]] views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been [[gastric bypass surgery]] rather than dieting and exercise alone as Star had insisted which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two. As a big-name talent O'Donnell drew criticism for her opinions while keeping the show's "[[word of mouth|buzz factor]] up".<ref name=buzz>[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/view/192276 "The Future of The View"] TV Guide, June 3, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-06-05.</ref> O'Donnell is credited with helping the show be more news-focused while still embracing the "fluff" of daytime TV talkshows (celebrities, fashion and food).<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20013740,00.html The View (Season 10) | TV Review | Entertainment Weekly<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Despite the overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose 27% over its year-ago [[Nielsen]] numbers. The show was the fourth most watched in all of daytime in the key demographic of women ages 18-49, and scored record ratings in the total viewer category with an average of 3.4 million viewers -- up 15% verses the same time in 2005.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955333.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 O'Donnell brings big ratings to 'The View' Daytime talk show nabs best-ever November sweeps]. ''Variety'' website. Accessed on May 29, 2007.</ref> O'Donnell adapted to the multi-personality forum in contrast to her anchoring her own talkshows in the past and moderated the opening "Hot Topics" portion of the show where newsworthy items were discussed. Unlike previous years, politics and [[taboo]] subjects were readily explored with O'Donnell and fellow-comic [[Joy Behar]] often giving strong opinions against President Bush's [[Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policies]] including the [[Iraq war]] which was losing support amongst Americans. As a conservative counterpoint, [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] would support the [[George W. Bush administration#Major issues of Presidency|Bush Administration]]'s issues and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take. Always outspoken, O'Donnell sometimes provoked debate, one time stating "radical [[Christianity]] is just as threatening as radical [[Islam]]" or criticizing fellow TV personalities. In January 2007, she questioned ''[[American Idol]]'' for airing auditions that [[humiliation|humiliated]] contestants.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18307579/ Rosie<U+2019>s stormy stay on <U+2018>The View<U+2019> will end].

Some [[conservative]]s called her statements "anti-Catholic bigotry" and suggested that such statements against other religions would not be tolerated.<ref>''Abortion Ruling Sparks a Backlash for Catholic Justices: Observers Raise Questions about Justices' Catholic Faith After the Supreme Court's Upholding of Late-Term

===O'Donnell/Hasselbeck argument===
O'Donnell has condemned many of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s policies, especially the [[war in Iraq]] and the resulting [[military occupation|occupation]].<ref name="Burned Up and Burn">{{cite web

On [[17 May]] [[2007]] O'Donnell rhetorically asked, {{cquote|[[Lancet surveys of casualties of the Iraq War|655,000 Iraqi civilians dead]].

On [[23 May]] [[2007]] a heated discussion ensued, in part, because of what O'Donnell perceived as [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck|Hasselbeck]]'s unwillingness to defend O'Donnell as not against the [[troop]]s with O'Donnell asking her "Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists?" Hasselbeck answered in the negative but also stated "Defend your own insinuations."<ref>Brian Orloff, ''[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20039945,00.html Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Rosie O'Donnell Square Off]'', People May 23, 2007.</ref><ref name=terrorists>{{cite web

Despite repeated attempts by their co-hosts to change the topic or cut to a commercial break, O'Donnell and Hasselbeck continued their debate.

According to [[ABC News]], O'Donnell said that she knew her time on the show was over when she saw the exchange reported in the news media with the [[split screen (film)|split screen]] effect showing her and Hasselbeck on either side. O'Donnell and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] agreed to cut short her contract agreement on [[May 25]], [[2007]] as a result of this issue. ABC News reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.<ref>ABC ''[[Eyewitness News]]''; May 28, 2007.</ref>

===Departure===
On [[April 25]] [[2007]], O'Donnell announced she would be leaving the show as a co-host when her contract expired because the network could not come to terms on the length of a new contract, but that she planned to return as an occasional correspondent.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/arts/television/26rosi.html Rosie O<U+2019>Donnell Says She Will Say Goodbye to <U+2018>The View<U+2019> in June].

Occasionally Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Barbara Walters make short cameo appearances. [[Jenny McCarthy]] appeared once briefly, as has Hasselbeck's mother-in-law and O'Donnell's mother-in-law, her life-partner Kelli's mother. [[Kathy Griffin]] also appeared, where she read some of the questions. It has become so popular that O'Donnell and her creative team are currently considering an "on the road" version of the video blog, in which Jahero would star. Although they are unsure of the locations, fan-submitted suggestions will likely influence the tour. Their announced goal was to begin in summer 2007. O'Donnell is the front runner for the "best celebrity blogger" category in the 2007 [[Blog|Blogger's]] Choice Awards.<ref name="Whitney Matheson">{{cite web
