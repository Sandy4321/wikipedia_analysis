===Refugee law===

Khaki continues to specialize in representing before the IRB a variety of severely marginalized social groups, such as persons living with HIV/AIDS and women fleeing [[domestic violence]] or other gender-based persecution.<ref name=StarMar24/>

===Progressive Islam===

Khaki founded Salaam, the first gay Muslim group in Canada and second in the world, in 1993, and organized the Salaam/Al-Fateha International Conference in 2003.<ref name=patch/> He co-founded and served as Secretary General of the [[Muslim Canadian Congress]], in August 2006 until the group split. Khaki and other members including much of the leadership of the MCC created a new organization, the [[Canadian Muslim Union]] (CMU).  He also founded, with academic Laury Silvers, and his partner Troy Jackson the El-Tawhid Juma Circle.  ETJC is a gender-equal, GLBTQ-friendly space for Friday prayers.

===Israel===
On May 23, 2009, Khaki made the opening remarks at a [[Queers Against Israeli Apartheid]] event to "reignite Toronto<U+2019>s queer community in the fight against apartheid".<ref>{{cite news|title=Reject anti-Israeli apartheid meeting, <U+2018>queers<U+2019> urged|url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/05/21/1005320/queers-against-israeli-apartheid-meeting-in-toronto}}</ref> Shortly after, [[B'nai Brith]] condemned him and implied that he is "part and parcel of the anti-Israel machinery that continues to churn out hateful and divisive propaganda."<ref name=KhakiI>{{cite news|title=Jewish group slams anti-Israel gays|url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/642138|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2009-05-29 | first=Antonia | last=Zerbisias | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

B'nai Brith executive vice-president Frank Dimant said Khaki should be subject to "disciplinary action" by Pride Toronto.

In response, Khaki with his partner Troy Jackson formed the Human Positive foundation, an organization which goal is "Justice, Freedom and Dignity for All peoples " and rejects the idea that criticism of the government of Israel is equivalent to antisemitism.

===Awards===
Khaki was honoured at the 2006 [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Week]] gala for his role in promoting queer Muslim awareness through Salaam.<ref name=patch/> Reverend [[Brent Hawkes]] of the Toronto [[Metropolitan Community Church]] said of Khaki and the group, "I think Salaam is very important, both locally and internationally, in terms of creating a safe place for people of Muslim tradition to be able to come together both socially and spiritually". Of Khakis role, he said "The work that El-Farouk has done is to help to make sure there is an option there."<ref name=patch/>  

In spring 2007, Khaki received the Steinert and Ferreiro Award from the [[Lesbian and Gay Community Appeal Foundation]] for his "major role in paving the way in Canada for refugee protection on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender", and because he "broke ground" in his work on gender equality in the Muslim community.<ref name=LGCAannounce>[http://www.lgca.ca/documents/LGCAMay29revised.pdf Tireless Activist and Advocate for Human Rights], ''LGCA'', 2007</ref> The previous summer, [[Pride Toronto]], one of the world's largest gay-pride festivals, recognized his work building tolerance and inclusiveness in the Muslim community with the 2006 Pride Award for Excellence in Spirituality.<ref name=ptannounce>[http://www.pridetoronto.com/media/downloads/pr_05232006.pdf Award Honourees Announced], ''Pride Toronto'', June 20, 2006</ref> Also in 2007, Khaki was honoured with the [[Canadian Bar Association]]'s  Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Conference Hero Award for contributions made in the area of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered people for his work with refugees who are sexual minorities or suffering from [[HIV]].<ref>[http://www.cba.org/CBA/News/2007_Releases/2007-08-11_sogichero.aspx "El-Farouk Khaki honoured with 2007 CBA SOGIC Hero Award,"] ''Canadian Bar Association'', August 11, 2007, accessed March 20, 2008</ref>
