'''Theophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr.''' (1845 <U+2013> August 16, 1928) was a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] architect best remembered for his churches and country houses. He founded the Department of Architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1890), and was its first head.

==Career==
Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Chandler was educated at [[Harvard University]] and in the [[atelier]] of [[Joseph Auguste <U+00C9>mile Vaudremer]] in [[Paris]]. Upon returning from France, he was employed by several offices in his native Boston. Under the aegis of landscape architect [[Robert Morris Copeland]], he relocated to Philadelphia in 1872, to work on development of the planned community of [[Ridley Park, Pennsylvania]].

On March 8, 1873, Chandler married Sophie Madeleine du Pont (1851-1931, no children). He designed country houses for a number of her relatives, and planned alterations to the mansion that is now the [[Winterthur Museum]].<ref>[http://findingaid.winterthur.org/html/HTML_Finding_Aids/COL0717.htm Chandler Papers] from Winterthur Library.</ref>

Most notable for his ecclesiastical style, Chandler designed major urban churches, including Philadelphia's [[Church of the New Jerusalem (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Church of the New Jerusalem]] (Swedenborgian) and Bethlehem Presbyterian Church, as well as [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh's]] First Presbyterian Church. He also designed exquisitely-detailed country churches, especially in the Philadelphia suburbs.

As founder and head of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Department of Architecture, Chandler essentially set forth the architectural climate in Philadelphia. He served as president of the Philadelphia Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]], and on the Board of Trustees of the Spring Garden Institute. He persuaded [[Warren P. Laird]] to move to Philadelphia to succeed him at Penn, and develop a curriculum based on that of the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]]. French architect [[Paul Cret]], in turn, succeeded Laird.

Chandler was an early restoration architect, making often sympathetic additions to historic structures. He designed alterations to [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] (1878, unbuilt), and doubled the width of [[John Haviland]]'s 1838 Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company (1902). The latter building was demolished in 1974, but its 4-story white-marble Egyptian-Revival facade stands at 508-10 Walnut Street in Philadelphia.

Chandler's papers, at the University of Pennsylvania Archives, include designs for furniture, a bridge, an elevated wire road (similar to a [[Gondola lift|gondola]]), and his unsuccessful submission in the 1889 design competition for the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York]].<ref>[http://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/faids/aaup/Chandler.pdf Theophilus P. Chandler Collection] at Architectural Archives, University of Pennsylvania.</ref>

Furniture designed by Chandler was exhibited at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in 1976.<ref>George E. Thomas, "Theophilus Parsons Chandler," ''Philadelphia: Three Centuries of American Art'' (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1976), pp. 415-16.</ref> A retrospective exhibition of his works, ''Theophilus P. Chandler Jr. : 
Portrait of an American Architect'', is scheduled at the [[Athenaeum of Philadelphia]] for September 13 to November 12, 2010.
