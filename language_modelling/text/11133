'''Saint Henry''' (''pyh<U+00E4> Henrik'' or ''piispa Henrik'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''Biskop Henrik'' or ''Sankt Henrik'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Henricus'' [[et cetera]] in [[Latin]]; died allegedly [[20 January]] [[circa]] 1150<ref name=year_of_death>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|pp=55&ndash;62}}.</ref>) was a medieval [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[clergy]]man. According to legends, he conquered [[Finland]] together with King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric the Saint]] of Sweden and died as a [[martyr]], becoming a central figure in the local [[Roman Catholic Church]]. However, the authenticity of the accounts of his life, ministry, and death are widely disputed.

Together with his alleged murderer [[Lalli]], Henry remains one of the most recognized people from the early [[history of Finland]]. His feast continues to be celebrated by the [[Roman Catholicism in Finland|Roman Catholic Church of Finland]], and he is commemorated in several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[liturgical calendar]]s.

==Official legend==
===''Vita'' and ''miracula''===
The officially accepted legend of Bishop Henry's life, or his ''[[hagiography|Vita]]'', was written at the end of the 13th century. It contains little concrete information about Henry. He is said to have been an [[England|English]]-born [[Bishop of Uppsala]] at the time of King [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric the Saint]] of Sweden in the mid-12th century, ruling the peaceful kingdom with the king in heavenly co-existence. To tackle the perceived threat from the non-Christian [[Finns]], Eric and Henry were forced to battle them. After they had conquered Finland, baptized the people and built many churches, the victorious king returned to Sweden while Henry (''Henricus'') remained with the Finns, more willing to live the life of a preacher than that of a high bishop.<ref name=heikkila>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|pp=398&ndash;417}} In Latin and in Finnish. All 52 known versions of the legend, many of which are fragmented, can also be downloaded from a [http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ttonteri/casc/download/legend.zip server] of the [[University of Helsinki]].</ref>

The legend draws to a conclusion as Henry attempted to give a canonical punishment to a murderer. The accused man became enraged and killed the bishop, who was thus considered to be a martyr.<ref name=heikkila/>

The legend strongly emphasizes that Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a [[List of Bishops of Turku|Bishop of Finland]]<ref>Bishop of Finland was renamed as the [[Bishop of Turku]] by 1259, see [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=118 Letter by [[Pope Alexander VI]] to the Bishop of Turku] in 1259. In Latin.</ref> which became a conventional claim later on, also by the church itself.<ref name=chronicon_2>For example, in Bishop [[Paulus Juusten]]'s ''Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium'' from the mid-16th century (not to be confused with another chronicle of the same name about 100 years earlier), Henry is listed as the first Bishop of Finland without any additional reservations.</ref> He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The ''vita'' is so void of any concrete information about Finland that it could have been created anywhere.<ref name=heikkila/> The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=188}}</ref>

[[Image:Piispa Henrik ja Lalli.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bishop Henry surrounded by his successors as depicted in ''[[Missale Aboense]]''.]]
Henry's ''Vita'' is followed by the more local ''miracula'', a list of eleven [[miracle]]s that various people were said to have experienced sometime after the bishop's death. With the exception of a priest in [[Skara]] who had gotten a stomach ache after mocking Henry, all miracles seem to have taken place in Finland. The other miracles, which usually occurred following prayer to Bishop Henry, were:<ref name=heikkila/>

# The murderer lost his scalp when he put the bishop's hat on his head
# The Bishop's finger was found the next Spring
# A boy was raised from the dead in Kaisala
# A girl was raised from the dead in [[Vehmaa]]
# A sick woman was healed in [[Sastamala]]
# A [[Franciscan]] called Erlend had his headache healed
# A blind woman got back her eye-sight in [[Kyr<U+00F6>]]
# A man with a paralyzed leg could walk again in Kyr<U+00F6>
# A sick girl was healed
# A group of fishermen from [[Kokem<U+00E4>ki]] survived a storm

Most versions of Henry's legend only include a selection of these miracles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=172}}.</ref>

=== Development of the legend ===
Henry and his crusade to Finland were also a part of the legend of King Eric. However, the oldest surviving version of Eric's legend is from about 1270, yet there is no information on either Henry or the crusade. The appendix of the early 13th century ''[[V<U+00E4>stg<U+00F6>talagen]]'', which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade.<ref>[http://www.nordlund.lu.se/Fornsvenska/Fsv%20Folder/01_Bitar/A.L5.D-Vidhem.html Original text] as hosted by the [[University of Lund]]. See also Beckman, Natanael (S1886): ''Medeltidslatin bland skaradj<U+00E4>knar 1943:1 s. 3''.</ref> Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=189}}.</ref> Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the [[Cathedral of Turku]] in 1300, when his alleged remains were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] there from [[Nousiainen]], a parish not far from [[Turku]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=234}}.</ref> Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the ''Chronica regni Gothorum'', a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of the Uppsala cathedral.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nygren|1953|pp=216&ndash;242}}.</ref>

[[Image:Seal of bishop benedictus of finland.gif|left|thumb|Henry pictured in the seal of Bishop Benedictus of Turku in 1332.]]
Noteworthy in the development of the legend is that the first canonically elected [[Bishop of Turku]], a certain [[Johan (archbishop)|Johan]] (1286<U+2013>1289) of [[Poles|Polish]] origin, was elected as the [[Archbishop of Uppsala]] in 1289, after three years in office in Turku. The Swedish bishops of Finland<ref>The so called "chancellor bishops of Finland" have been shown to have been a creation of later historians, especially by Juusten in his chronicle of the Finnish Bishops during the 16th century, by Herman Sh<U+00FC>ck in Historisk Tidskrift 2/1963 in his article "Kansler och capella regis under folkungatiden". As to Ragvald and Kettil, the title "chancellor" rests solely on Juustens imagination and is in contradiction with the real and known chancellors of the time. As to Bero, who is mentioned alreardy in the so called "Palmsk<U+00F6>lds fragment" probably from the time of Turku bishop Magnus Tavast from the 15th century (dating by Jarl Galll<U+00E9>n in "De engelska munkarna i Uppsala - ett katedralkloster p<U+00E5> 1100-talet, Historisk Tidskrift f<U+00F6>r Finland 1976, p.17), according to Sch<U+00FC>ck, Bero might have been the kings chaplain.</ref>  before him, [[Bishop Bero|Bero]], Ragvald and Kettil, had apparently been selected by the [[King of Sweden]]. Related to the new situation was also the appointment of the [[Benedict, Duke of Finland|king's brother]] as the [[Duke of Finland]] in 1284, which challenged the bishop's earlier position as the sole authority on all local matters. Johan was followed in Turku by [[Bishop Magnus]] (1291<U+2013>1308), who had been born in Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kari|2004|pp=122&ndash;123,132&ndash;134}}.</ref>

[[Image:The Cathedral of Turku.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cathedral of Turku]] was the center of Henry's cult.]]
The first mention of Bishop Henry in historical sources is from 1298, when he is mentioned along with king Eric in a document from a provincial synod of Uppsala in Telge.<ref>Diplomatarium Suecanum nr.1746. The document previously dated to 1295-1296 has been shown by Jarl Gall<U+00E9>n to be from 22.4.1391 in his article "Studier i <U+00C5>bo domkyrkans Svartbok" in Historisk Tidskrift f<U+00F6>r Finland 1978. The same document has been published twice by Hausen, first with false dating in "Registrum Ecclesiae Aboensis" in the year 1890 (nr.18) and then with right dating in "Finlands Medeltids Urkunder" in the year 1910 (nr. 999).</ref> The first mention of Henry of Uppsala being the patron saint of Turku cathedral is from 14.8.1320, when he is mentioned as the second patron of the cathedral after Virgin Mary.<ref> Hausen's Registrum Ecclesiae Aboensis nr.27</ref> So when he is later addressed by [[Pope Boniface IX ]] as the ''[[patronus]]'' of the Cathedral of Turku along with the [[Virgin Mary]], it is actually from the year 1391. Boniface also called him a "saint".<ref>name=heikkila_95{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=95}}. See also [http://www.arkkihiippakunta.fi/cgi-bin/linnea.pl?document=00010680 History of the Cathedral of Turku] by the Archdiocese of Turku.</ref> In 1291 a longish document by the [[chapter (religion)|cathedral chapter]] makes no reference to Henry even though it mentions the cathedral and election of the new bishop many times.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=201 Letter by the Turku cathedral chapter] in 1291. In Latin.</ref> A papal letter by [[Pope Nicholas IV]] from 1292 has the Virgin Mary as the sole ''patronus'' in Turku.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=206 Letter by Pope Nicholas IV] in 1292. In Latin.</ref> The legend itself is first referred to in a letter by Archbishop of Uppsala in 1298. Eric and Henry are mentioned together as martyrs who needed to be prayed to for the sake of the situation in [[Karelia]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Linna|1989|p=113}}.</ref> thus associating their alleged crusade to Finland with the new expeditions against [[Novgorod]]. The [[Swedish-Novgorodian Wars|war between Novgorod and Sweden]] for the control of Karelia had started in 1293. The first certain appearance of Henry's image in the seal of the Bishop of Turku is from 1299.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=97}}.</ref>

Thus, Henry's veneration as a saint and his relation to King Eric seem to have emerged in the historical record at the same time in the mid-1290s with strong support from the church. This correlates with the start of the war against Novgorod. Sources do not support the popular assumption, that Henry's cult had developed in Nousiainen and gradually spread among ordinary people before official adoption. Although Nousiainen had Henry as its ''patronus'', that is first mentioned only in 1452.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=86}}.</ref> Still in 1232, the church in Nousiainen was consecrated to the Virgin Mary only.<ref name=letter_1232/>

Some sources claim that Henry was [[canonization|canonized]] in 1158, but this information has been traced to a late publication by [[Johannes Vastovius]] in 1623 and is generally regarded as a fabrication.<ref name=canonization>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=100,445}}.</ref>

=== Veneration ===
[[Image:lunds domkyrka.jpg|right|thumb|Henry was also venerated in the [[Lund Cathedral|Cathedral of Lund]].]]
Despite the high profile start of Henry's ''cultus'', it took more than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's [[veneration]] was rare outside the Diocese of Turku throughout the 14th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=116}}.</ref> [[Vadstena Abbey]] near [[Link<U+00F6>ping]] seems to have played a key role in establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=204}}.</ref> Henry never received the highest ''[[totum duplex]]'' veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a ''patronus'' of the church there, which status he had both in Turku and Nousiainen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=87}}.</ref>

At the end of the Roman Catholic era in Sweden, Henry was well established as a local saint. The dioceses in Sweden and elsewhere venerating Henry were as follows, categorized by his local ranking:<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=79}}.</ref>

# ''Totum duplex'': Turku, [[Link<U+00F6>ping]], [[Str<U+00E4>ngn<U+00E4>s]]
# ''Duplex'': Uppsala, [[Lund]] ([[Denmark]]), [[V<U+00E4>ster<U+00E5>s]], [[V<U+00E4>xj<U+00F6>]]
# ''Semiduplex'': [[Nidaros]] ([[Norway]])
# ''Simplex'': [[Skara]]<ref>Noteworthy is that king Eric was from V<U+00E4>sterg<U+00F6>taland, which was a part of the Diocese of Skara.</ref>

Henry seems to have been known in northern [[Germany]], but he was largely ignored elsewhere in the Roman Catholic world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|pp=118&ndash;125}}.</ref>

[[Image:Graduale Aboense.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Original ''Gaudeamus omnes''.]]
In the Bishopric of Turku, the annual feast day of Henry was January 20 (''talviheikki'', "Winter Henry"), according to traditions the day of his death. Elsewhere his memorial was held already on January 19,<ref>Interestingly, January 19 was also the memorial of King [[Canute IV of Denmark]] who had been canonized [[January 19]], [[1101]] by [[Pope Paschal II]]. Coincidentally, also his relics were translated in 1300, to the [[Saint Canute's Cathedral]] in [[Odense]].</ref> since more prominent saints were already commemorated on January 20. After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Henry's day was moved to the 19th in Finland as well.<ref>[http://www.evl.fi/arkkipiispa/henrik.htm Archbishop Jukka Paarma's speech on Henry]. In Finnish.</ref> The existence of the feast day is first mentioned in 1335, and is known to have been marked in the [[Calendar of Saints|liturgical calendar]] from the early 15th century onwards. Another memorial was held on June 18 (''kes<U+00E4>heikki'', "Summer Henry") which was the day of the translation of his relics to the Cathedral of Turku.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=80,96}}</ref>

''Gaudeamus omnes'' ("Let all rejoice"), a [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] [[introit]] for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in honor of Henry has survived in the late 14th or early 15th century ''Graduale Aboense''.<ref>[http://libraries.theeuropeanlibrary.org/Finland/treasures_en.xml Graduale Aboense] in [http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/ The European Library].</ref> Listen to the introit:
{{listen|filename=Gaudeamus omnes - Graduale Aboense.ogg|title=''Gaudeamus omnes''}}

=== Political dimensions ===
{{Christianization of Finland}}
According to legend, establishment of the church of Finland was entirely the work of the saint-king Eric of Sweden, assisted by the bishop from the most important diocese in the country. The first half of the legend describes how the king and the bishop ruled Sweden like "two great lights" with feelings of 'internal love' toward each other, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of the secular and ecclesiastical rule during a happy era when 'predatory wolves' could not hit their "poisonous teeth against the innocent".<ref name=heikkila/> The reality was quite different<U+2014>Eric's predecessor, Eric himself and two of his successors were all murdered almost within a decade, one of the bloodiest times for the Swedish royalty. In the 1150s, the Bishop of Uppsala was also in a bitter fight with the [[Bishop of Link<U+00F6>ping]] over which see would become archiepiscopal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kari|2004|pp=110&ndash;112}}.</ref> The crusade itself is described as a brief and bloodless event that was only performed to bring the "blind and evil heathen people of Finland" under Christian order.<ref name=heikkila/>

The writer of the legend seems to have been especially interested in presenting the bishop as a humble martyr. He has fully ignored his place of death and burial and other "domestic" Finnish interests, which were much more apparent in folk traditions. The official legend and folk traditions eventually influenced each other, and the church gradually adopted many additional details to its saint bishop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=256}}.</ref>

== Folk traditions ==
Among the many folk traditions about Henry, the most prominent is the folk poem "The Death-lay of Bishop Henry" (''Piispa Henrikin surmavirsi''). The poem almost totally ignores Henry's life and ministry and concentrates on his death.<ref name=death_lay>[http://agricola.utu.fi/hist/kronologia/henrik.html The Death-lay of Bishop Henry]. In Finnish.</ref>

=== Henry's origins ===
According to the poem, Henry had grown up in "Cabbage Land" (''Kaalimaa''), which has puzzled Finnish historians for centuries. The name might be connected to a coastal area in northern Finland Proper called ''[[Kaland]]'', which is also mentioned in conjunction with an unrelated early preacher in [[Vesilahti]], central [[Tavastia]], whose local name was "Fish of Kaland" (''Kalannin kala'', also known as ''Hunnun herra'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Werner|1958|pp=}}. {{Harvnb|L<U+00E4>hteenm<U+00E4>ki|1946|pp=}}.</ref> Bishop [[Mikael Agricola]] wrote in his ''[[Se Wsi Testamenti]]'' in 1548, that the earliest Swedish settlers in Finland had come from [[Gotland]] to the islets on the coast of Kaland, being harassed by Finns and seeking help from their relatives in Sweden.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agricola|1987|pp=}}</ref>

It has also been suggested that the name might be related to [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], which would presumably have referred to the bishop's [[Scot]]tish origins.<ref>[http://www.kirkko850.fi/html/vuosisadat.htm About Bishop Henry by the Lutheran Church of Finland].</ref>

Folk traditions have no information on the crusade whatsoever. King Eric is briefly mentioned in the death-lay's preface as Henry's concerned "brother". Henry appears as a lone preacher who moved around southwestern Finland more or less on his own. Besides the name, he has only little in common with the official Henry in the church ''vita''.<ref name=heikkila_246_256/>

[[Kokem<U+00E4>ki]] is often mentioned in traditions as a place where Henry preached.<ref>[http://www.kokemaki.fi/asukas/vapaa-aika/kulttuuri/historia/villa_cumasta_kokemaen_kaupunkii/] on the official www site of the municipality of Kokem<U+00E4>ki.</ref> Kokem<U+00E4>ki was later one the central parishes in [[Satakunta]]. This province was first mentioned in historical documents in 1331.<ref>Linna,1996, pp.151-158.{{Harvnb|Suvanto|1973|pp=}}.</ref>

=== Death and burial ===
[[Image:Henrik Lalli Ekman.JPG|thumb|right|Lalli killing Henry. A romanticized drawing from the 19th century.]]
The death-lay's version of the bishop's death was different from the official ''vita''. The bishop's killer was called [[Lalli]]. Lalli's wife Kerttu falsely claimed to him that upon leaving the manor, their ungrateful guest Henry, travelling around on his own in the middle of winter, had without permission or recompense, through violence, taken food for himself and hay for his horse. This is supposed to have enraged Lalli so that he immediately grabbed his skis and went in pursuit of the thief, finally chasing Henry down on the ice of Lake [[K<U+00F6>yli<U+00F6>nj<U+00E4>rvi]]. There he killed him on the spot with an axe.<ref name=death_lay/> In some versions of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. Axe was the murder weapon of [[Saint Olaf]], who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=259}}. [[Satakunta]], the traditional region of Henry's activities, had [[Saint Olaf]] as its regional saint. Olaf's cult remained much more popular in Satakunta throughout the Middle Ages, presumably because it had been well established long before Henry's.</ref>

Bishop Henry's body was then buried at [[Nousiainen]]. According to the poem, that was the place where the team of oxen pulling his hearse stopped.<ref name=death_lay/>

Medieval folk traditions enumerate the pestilences and misfortunes which befell Lalli after his slaying of the bishop. His hair and scalp are said to have fallen out as he took off the bishop's cap, taken as a trophy. Removing the bishop's ring from his finger, just bones remained. Eventually he ran into a lake and drowned himself.<ref name=death_lay/><ref name=judas_fable/>

=== Development of folk traditions ===
Basically the death-lay is a simple story of a short-tempered man who falls victim of his "bad-mouthed wife's" sharp tongue. The poem has no pity for Lalli, and he is not depicted as a hero in a story whose true antagonist is Kerttu. The way the poem presents Henry's death, builds on an independent tradition that in some point of time was in direct competition with the "official" version, which is largely forgotten today. Whether the two traditions were built around the same person, remains unknown.<ref name=heikkila_246_256>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|pp=246&ndash;256}}.</ref>

The poem, following the traditional [[Kalevala]] metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from various parts of Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the official Catholic ''vita''.<ref name=heikkila_253>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=253}}.</ref> Whether the original poem was constructed by one or more individuals, is debated. The writer has however had superficial understanding of the church legends.<ref name=heikkila_253/>

Both Lalli (Laurentius) and Kerttu (Gertrud) are originally German names, which might indicate that the poem was partly constructed on foreign models, whose influence is visible in other aspects, too. The way Lalli is manipulated to commit the crime and what happens to him later, seem to be taken from a medieval [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] fable.<ref name=judas_fable>[http://www.tieteessatapahtuu.fi/0806/Anttonen0806.pdf Article in ''Tieteess<U+00E4> tapahtuu'' magazine]. 2006/8. In Finnish.</ref> Extensive borrowing from unrelated Finnish legends from the pre-Christian era has taken place as well, leaving quite little original material left at all.<ref>[http://www.koylio-seura.fi/surmavirsi/html/files/1_Oiva_Linturin_gradu.doc Linguistic analysis of the poem]. Provided by the K<U+00F6>yli<U+00F6> Association; in Finnish.</ref>

Based on finds from medieval church ruins in the tiny island of ''Kirkkokari'' ("Church Rock", previously known as the "Island of Saint Henry") in Lake K<U+00F6>yli<U+00F6>nj<U+00E4>rvi, the bishop's veneration began in the latter half of the 14th century, well after Henry had received his official status as a local saint, and 200 years after his alleged death.<ref>See [http://www.rauma.fi/Raumanseutu/Paikallishistorian_opetusmateriaali/keskiaika.htm]; in Finnish. See also [http://www.nba.fi/fi/mjhkohteetsatakunta#kirkkokari description by the National Board of Antiquities of Finland]; in Finnish.</ref> A small granary in the near-by [[Kokem<U+00E4>ki]], claimed to have been the bishop's place of rest the night before his death, could not be dated earlier than the late 15th century in [[Dendrology|dendrological]] examinations.<ref>[http://www.nba.fi/fi/mjhkohteetsatakunta#telja Description of Bishop Henry's Granary by the National Board of Antiquities of Finland].</ref>

However, the poem's claim that Henry was buried in Nousiainen was already an official truth around 1300, when his alleged bones were  translated from Nousiainen to the Cathedral of Turku. A mid-15th century ''Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium'' also confirmed K<U+00F6>yli<U+00F6> as the place of his death.<ref name=chronicon_1>[http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Sweden/Abo/abo.html Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium], hosted by the University of Columbia.</ref> Neither place is mentioned in the official ''vita'' in any way. The church seems to have gradually complemented its own legends by adopting elements from the folk traditions, especially during the 15th century.<ref name=heikkila_253/>

== Historical sources ==
Today, the official Catholic legend of Henry is challenged by historians to the point of being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Delehaye|1955|pp=}}.</ref> and in the lack of evidence of either the crusade or Henry, that possibility may not be fully denied.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=78}}.</ref>

The bishop's violent death itself was nothing exceptional and could well have happened. Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. [[Saxo Grammaticus]] said of the [[Battle of Fotevik]] in 1134 that never had so many bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187,<ref>Archbishop [[Johannes (archbishop of Uppsala)|Johannes]]. {{Harvnb|<U+00C5>sbrink|1935|p=}}.</ref> [[Bishop of Estonia]] in 1219<ref>[[Bishop Theoderich]]. See [http://www.estonica.org/eng/lugu.html?menyy_id=94&kateg=43&alam=61&leht=2 Estonian Middle Ages] by the [http://www.einst.ee/ Estonian Institute].</ref> and [[Bishop of Link<U+00F6>ping]] in 1220.<ref name=eesti_ajalugu>Bishop [[Karl Magnusson]]. {{Harvnb|Andresen|1997 (2002)|p=}}.</ref>

=== Bishop of Uppsala ===
There is no historical record of a [[Bishop of Uppsala]] called Henry during the reign of King Eric (about 1156<U+2013>1160). Early phases of the diocese remain obscure up to the point of [[Stefan (archbishop of Uppsala)|Stefan]], who was appointed as the archbishop in 1164.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+00C5>sbrink|1935|p=}}.</ref>

A certain Henry is mentioned in ''Incerti scriptorts Sueci chronicon primorumin ecclesia Upsalensi archiepiscoporum'', a chronicle of Uppsala archbishops, before Coppmannus and Stefan, but after Sverinius (probably mentioned in German sources in 1141/2 as "[[Bishop Siwardus|Siwardus]]"<ref>See [http://runeberg.org/nfce/0130.html].</ref>), Nicolaus and Sweno.<ref>See [http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Sweden/Uppsala1/ups1.html]. Hosted by the University of Columbia. In Latin.</ref> Besides the name, the chronicle knows that he was martyred and buried in Finland in the [[Cathedral of Turku]]. Latest research dates the chronicle to the early 15th century when Henry's legend was already established in the kingdom, leaving only little significance to its testimony.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=60}}.</ref>

[[Image:Gamla uppsala kyrka.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gamla Uppsala]] Church, the site of the Uppsala bishops and archbishops until 1273.]]
A late 15th century ''legenda nova'' claimed that Henry had come to Sweden in the retinue of [[papal legate]] Nicholas Breakspear, the later [[Pope Adrian IV]], and appointed as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though ''legenda nova'' states 1150 as the year of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. If this was just a conclusion by the writer himself based on the fact that also Nicholas was an Englishman, is not known.<ref>Medieval ''Anglia docens'' propaganda wanted to play down the Danish part in the establishment of the Swedish church, often claiming early clergymen to have English heritage or education. {{Harvnb|Schmidt|1934|pp=}}.</ref> However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala.<ref>Bergquist, Anders.

Kyrkom<U+00F6>tet 1153.</ref> Another claim by ''legenda nova'' was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s.<ref name=heikkila_59/> In the late 16th century, Bishop [[Paulus Juusten]] claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death.<ref name=heikkila_59>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=59}}.</ref> Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.<ref name=year_of_death/>

Contradicting these claims, the medieval ''Annales Suecici Medii Aevi''<ref>{{Harvnb|Paulsson|1974|pp=}}. The ''Annales'' were written in the Sigtuna Abbey. See [http://www.foteviken.se/Utblick/Art_utblick/utb006.htm an article] by the Museum of Foteviken.</ref> and the 13th century legend of [[Saint Botvid]]<ref>[http://saints.sqpn.com/ncd01391.htm Saint Botvid in the New Catholic Dictionary]. Botvid had been converted to Christianity in England. He was martyred around 1100 in Sweden. Interestingly, [http://www.holyspiritinteractive.net/dailysaint/july/0728.asp some sources] claim that he was murdered by a Finnish slave. See also [http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1950talet/1952_178.pdf].</ref> mention some Henry as the Bishop of Uppsala (''Henricus scilicet Upsalensis'') in 1129, participating in the consecration of the saint's newly built church.<ref>See [http://runeberg.org/nfbi/0366.html]. In Swedish.</ref> He is apparently the same Bishop Henry who died at the Battle of Fotevik in 1134, fighting along with the Danes after being banished from Sweden. Known from the ''[[Chronicon Roskildense]]'' written soon after his death and from [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' from the early 13th century, he had fled to Denmark from [[Sigtuna]], the see of the early Uppland bishops before it was moved a few kilometers to its later location in Uppsala sometime before 1164.<ref>Sigtuna is mentioned as the earlier location of the Uppsala see in a letter by [[Pope Alexander III]] to the King [[Knut Eriksson]] and [[Jarl]] [[Birger Brosa]] in 1170s ([[Svenskt Diplomatarium]] I nr 852.

That would make the claim about him coming to Finland with King Eric a late innovation, where memory about a killed bishop in Uppsala sometime in the 12th century was reused in a new context.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schmidt|1934|pp=}}.</ref>

Noteworthy also, is a story written down by [[Adam of Bremen]] in his ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (Deeds of [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bishops of the Hamburg]] Church) from 1075/6 about a certain foreigner called ''Hericus'', who was slain and martyred while preaching among the ''[[Sueones]]''. Adam had heard the story from King [[Sweyn II of Denmark]].<ref>[http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum], online text in Latin. See III 53.</ref> According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born ''Henricus'', who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Linna|1996|pp=148&ndash;207}}.</ref>

=== Bishop of Finland ===
No historical source remains that would confirm the existence of a bishop named Henry in Finland. However, papal letters mentioning an unidentified Bishop of Finland in 1209, 1221, 1229 and 1232 have survived.<ref>Papal letters [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=48 1209], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=64 1221], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=72 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=73 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=74 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=75 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=76 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=77 1229], [http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=78 1229],
[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=80 1232]. In Latin. Hosted by the [http://www.narc.fi/ National Archive of Finland]. See [http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/sahkoiset/] and ''Diplomatarium Fennicum'' from the menu.</ref> Some copies of another papal letter from 1232 call the bishop as "N.",<ref name=letter_1232>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=79 Papal letter to chaplain of Nousiainen] in 1232. In Latin.</ref> but the letter "N" may originally have also been something resembling it. The first certainly known Bishop of Finland is [[Bishop Thomas|Thomas]], who is first mentioned in 1234.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=81 Letter by Bishop Thomas to his chaplain]. In Latin.</ref> It is however possible, that [[Bishop Fulco|Fulco]], the Bishop of Estonia mentioned in sources from 1165 and 1171,<ref name=rebane/> was the same as Folquinus, a legendary Bishop of Finland at the end of the 12th century, but this remains only a theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Juva|1964|p=125}}.</ref>

[[Image:B-Alexander III1.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Pope Alexander III]] was the first Pope to address the situation of the [[Catholic church|Catholic]] mission in [[Estonia]] and [[Finland]].]]
No Bishop or Diocese of Finland is mentioned in a papal letter from 1171 (or 1172) by the seemingly well-informed [[Pope Alexander III]], who otherwise addressed the situation of the church in Finland. The Pope mentions that there were preachers, presumably from Sweden, working in Finland and was worried about their bad treatment by the Finns.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=24 Letter by Pope Alexander III to the Archbishop of Uppsala]. In Latin.</ref> The Pope had earlier in 1165 authorized the [[Bishop Fulco|first missionary Bishop of Estonia]] to be appointed, and was a close acquaintance of both [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], the [[Archbishop of Lund]], and [[Stefan (archbishop of Uppsala)|Stefan]], the Archbishop of Uppsala, who both had spent time with him in France where he had been exiled in the 1160s. Following the situation in Estonia, the Pope personally interfered in the Estonian mission in 1171, ordering assistance for the local Bishop Fulco from Norway.<ref name=rebane>{{Harvnb|Rebane|1989|pp=37&ndash;68}}. {{Harvnb|Rebane|2001|p=171&ndash;200}}</ref>

No surviving list of bishops or dioceses under the Archibishop of Uppsala from 1164, 1189, 1192, 1233, 1241 or 1248 contains any reference to Finland, neither factual or propagandist. No claim about a Swedish bishop in Finland is made in any other source from the era prior to the so-called [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in 1249.<ref name=varhaiskeskiajan_lahteita>{{Harvnb|Linna|1989|p=}}.</ref>

[[Image:Anders Sunesen.jpg|thumb|left|Archbishop [[Anders Sunesen]] (sitting) was the first to inform the Pope about a bishop in Finland.]]
The first mention of a bishop in Finland is from a papal letter in 1209. It was sent to [[Anders Sunesen|Archbishop Anders]] of Lund by [[Pope Innocent III]] as a reply to the Archbishop's earlier letter which has not survived. According to the Archbishop, the Bishop of the newly established church in Finland was dead, apparently from natural causes since his passing away is mentioned to have been "lawful", and the see had been vacant for some time. The Archbishop had complained to the Pope how difficult it was to get anyone to be a bishop in Finland and planned to appoint someone without formal adequacy, who was already working in Finland. The Pope approved of Archbishop's suggestion without questioning his opinions.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=48 Letter by Pope Innocent III to the Archbishop of Lund]. In Latin.</ref> It is noteworthy that the Archbishop of Uppsala, [[Valerius (archbishop of Uppsala)|Valerius]] (1207<U+2013>1219/1224), was also in Denmark at the time, temporarily exiled from Sweden after having allied with the deposed [[Sverker II of Sweden|King Sverker]], yet another exile in Denmark.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+00C5>sbrink|1935|p=}}.</ref> 

Whether the appointment of the said preacher ever took place, remains unknown. Note should be taken that the King of Sweden at the time was [[Eric X of Sweden|Eric]], a grandson of his better known namesake Eric the Saint. Eric had taken over Sweden in 1208 and was crowned king two years later. The Pope who had strongly sided with Sverker, ignored him at first, but finally recognized him in 1216, commenting many requests that he had apparently made ever since having taken the office. Based on the papal letter that year, Eric seems to have had a plan to invade some country that allegedly had been "taken from the heathens by his predecessors" and was allowed to install a bishop there.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=52 Papal letter to King Eric in 1216]. In Latin.</ref> Similar letters were sent to the [[King of Denmark]] in 1208 and 1218, who is known to have meant [[Estonia]] both times.<ref name=varhaiskeskiajan_lahteita/> Sweden also [[Battle of Lihula|attacked Estonia]] in 1220.<ref name=eesti_ajalugu/> Eric died of illness 1216. Almost nothing is known about his time as the king.<ref>{{Harvnb|Linna|1989|p=113}}.</ref>

Nevertheless, someone was eventually appointed and installed as the new bishop, since [[Pope Honorius III]] sent a letter directly to an unnamed Bishop of Finland in 1221. According to the letter, Archbishop Valerius<ref>Note that the letter does not mention the name of the archbishop. However, Valerius had died in 1219 and the Uppsala see was vacant until 1224.</ref> had followed the situation in Finland and sent a report to the Pope, worried about a threat from unidentified "barbarians". It is notable that when the Pope quoted Valerius in his letter, he calls the church in Finland to have been established "newly", the same claim that Anders had made 12 years earlier.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=64 Papal letter to Bishop of Finland] in 1221. In Latin.</ref> The list of Swedish bishops which survives from this era is from king John Sverkerson's coronation from the year 1219 and it mentions the bishops which have been present at the coronation. Finland as well as W<U+00E4>xj<U+00F6> are not among those five, which so seem to have been all the bishops of the Swedish realm at that time.<ref>Diplomatarium Suecanum nr.181.</ref> So the finnish bishop's possible position under Uppsala's primacy is higly improbable.<ref name=varhaiskeskiajan_lahteita/>

Despite so many high-ranking church representatives being involved in the 1209/1221 arrangements, later chronicles are fully ignorant on the situation in Finland at the time, or if there was even a bishop then. The first 13th century bishop is said to have been [[Bishop Thomas|Thomas]], and his predecessor remains unknown. According to 15th and 16th century chronicles, Henry was followed by bishops [[Bishop Rodulff|Rodulff]] and [[Bishop Folquinus|Folquinus]], after whom there was a 25<U+2013>30 year gap before Thomas.<ref name=chronicon_1/><ref name=chronicon_2/>However, according to the papal letter Ex tuarum no such gap has ever existed, since the archpishop of Lund
is been given the right to annoint a new bishop to Finland in 1209 after the death of the previous. So the logic and datings of the sixteenth century writers must be esteemed as false. The date 1209 is far too early for a dominican like Thomas to step in to the office, and so Rodolphus, the first real bishop of Finland and his successor Folquinus must be considered as 13th century bishops nominated and appointed by the danish and not by the swedes.<ref>Linna, 1996 pp.192-202</ref> As an extra proof of this the ancient finnish taxation system of churh taxes has its roots in Denmark, not in Sweden.<ref>L<U+00E4>ntinen Aarre,Turun keskiaikainen piispanp<U+00F6>yt<U+00E4>,Studia historica Jyv<U+00E4>skyl<U+00E4>ensis 16, Jyv<U+00E4>skyl<U+00E4> 1978 pp113-117.</ref> And the same goes to lay taxes especially in the <U+00C5>land Islands and to the old finnish monetary system.<ref>Voionmaa, V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6>, Studier i <U+00C5>lands Medeltidshistoria,Suomen Muinaismuistoyhdistyksen aikakauskirja XXVII, 1916,s 107, Voionmaa, V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6>, Kansallinen raha -ja mittaj<U+00E4>rjestelm<U+00E4> Suomessa varhaisemmalla keskiajalla, Suomen Museo 1914</ref> As J.

[[Image:Henrik Cruisade Nousiainen.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Henry's (empty) sarcophagus in the church of Nousiainen with depictions of the crusade.]]
Henry was allegedly buried in [[Nousiainen]], from where his bones<U+2014>or at least something that was thought to be his bones<U+2014>were translated to [[Turku]] in 1300.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=94}}. Some historians have proposed that the translation took place already before 1296, or even so late than 1309. The year 1300 is from the mid-15th century ''Chronicon'' and remains generally accepted.</ref> In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by [[Bishop Thomas]] in Nousiainen in 1234.<ref>[http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=81 Letter by Bishop Thomas to his chaplain] in 1234.

The book contains a thorough comparison of finds from dozens of cemeteries around southwestern Finland.</ref>

Whatever the case, the bishop's grave seems to have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his elevation to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop's grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to Turku.<ref name=heikkila_108>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|p=108}}.</ref> The church was later adorned with a grandiose 15th century [[cenotaph]], whose replica can be found in the [[National Museum of Finland]] in [[Helsinki]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Heikkil<U+00E4>|2005|pp=257<U+2013>61}}.</ref>

[[Image:Henrik sormi.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Henry's finger depicted in the seal of Bishopric of Turku from 1618.]]
Most of the bones in Turku were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a transfer to [[Saint Petersburg]] during the Russian occupation of Finland in the [[Great Northern War]]. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count [[Gustaf Otto Douglas]] who had defected to the Russian side during the war and was in charge of the [[Greater Wrath|grim occupation]] of Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kari|2004|p=135}}.</ref> What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way.<ref name=heikkila_108/> However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's [[ulna]] had been placed in [[Bishop Hemming]]'s reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.<ref name=relic_news/>

In the 1990s, the National Board of Antiquities claimed the relic as its own on the basis of the Finnish law on ancient objects and was contradicted by the Cathedral Parish of Turku. However, the Board let the relic be relocated in the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland. Since then, it has been located inside the altar of the cathedral. After a public controversy, it is currently planned to be returned to Turku during 2007. Also its authenticity is going to be examined.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Piispa+Henrikin+pyh%C3%A4inj%C3%A4%C3%A4nn%C3%B6kset+tutkittaviksi+Turkuun/1135224461668 Article in Helsingin Sanomat 21.01.2007.]</ref>

In 1924, several other bones, including a jawless skull, were found in a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are also referred to as Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.<ref name=relic_news>See e.g. [http://www.henrikinseurakunta.fi/portal/seurakunnat/henrikinseurakunta/suomi/ajankohtaista/?id=2556&area=2 news by the Turku and Kaarina parish].
