'''State Route 39''' (SR-39) is a state highway in northern [[Utah]] connecting [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] to [[Woodruff, Utah|Woodruff]] via Ogden Canyon and [[Huntsville, Utah|Huntsville]]. The highway is on '''12th Street''' in Ogden and the '''Ogden River Scenic Byway''' through Ogden Canyon. The route is over sixty-seven miles long.

Prior to [[1964]], SR-39 was routed along 24th Street and Harrison Boulevard in Ogden. A change in the route moved the route north to 12th Street.<ref name="routehistory"/>

==Route description==
===Ogden===
The route begins heading east from the intersection at 4700 West ([[Utah State Route 134|SR-134]]) as a two-lane highway in a relatively rural part of [[Weber County, Utah|Weber County]]. By the junction of 1900 West ([[Utah State Route 126|SR-126]]) in a more urban portion of the county, the route is widened to five lanes. The highway variates in direction after Monroe Boulevard, veering to the southeast.

===Ogden Canyon to Woodruff===
Once exiting Ogden, the route becomes more curved as it traverses Ogden Canyon on a two-lane road, still maintaining a general east-northeasterly direction. Right before entering Huntsville, the route turns north and becomes 7800 East. The route turns east and maintains an initial north-northeasterly direction before eventually turning northeast. The route terminates on Main Street ([[Utah State Route 16|SR-16]]) in Woodruff. The [[Ogden River]] runs parallel to the highway during its tenure in Ogden Canyon. This portion of the route is named Ogden River Scenic Byway.

==History==
The highway was established in [[1911]], running from Ogden (which would be at [[US-91]] once it was formed in [[1926]]) through 24th Street and Harrison Boulevard in the city to Woodruff via Ogden Canyon and Huntsville. A change later that year truncated the route to Huntsville. This change was reverted in [[1919]].<ref name="routehistory"/>

[[1964]] was the year the route was moved north to 12th Street in Ogden. The portion on Harrison Boulevard was transferred to [[Utah State Route 37|SR-37]] and [[Utah State Route 203|SR-203]] and in [[1965]], the western terminus was moved to present day [[Utah State Route 126|SR-126]]. In [[1995]], the western terminus was moved to SR-134.<ref name="routehistory"/>
