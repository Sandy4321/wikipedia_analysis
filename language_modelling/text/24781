'''Alpha Phi Alpha''' ('''<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>''') is an intercollegiate [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] that is generally recognized as the first established by [[African American]]s. Founded on [[December 4]], 1906 on the campus of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], the fraternity utilizes motifs and artifacts from [[Ancient Egypt]] to represent the organization.  The fraternity has initiated over 175,000 men into the organization and has been open to men of all races since 1945.  Alpha Phi Alpha declared 2006 the beginning of its "Centennial Era", and convenes July 25 - 30, 2006 in [[Washington, D.C.]]  to celebrate its centenary.  The fraternity preserves its archives at the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]].  

Founders [[Henry A. Callis]], [[Charles H. Chapman]], [[Eugene K. Jones]], [[George B. Kelley]], [[Nathaniel A. Murray]], [[Robert H. Ogle]] and [[Vertner W. Tandy]] are collectively known as the "[[:Category:Alpha Phi Alpha founders|Seven Jewels]]" and they swiftly expanded the fraternity when a second chapter was chartered at [[Howard University]] in 1907.  Beginning in 1908, the Howard chapter became the prototype for six of the remaining eight [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] members, a predominantly African-American fraternal council. Today there are over 700 Alpha chapters in the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia, and the West Indies. The Alphas have encountered problems similar to other fraternities, including a two-year suspension for a 2001 [[hazing]] episode at [[Ohio State University]]. 

The history of America is the history of Alpha Phi Alpha as the fraternity has played a role in the [[Great Depression]], [[World War II]], [[civil rights]], and social, economic, cultural and political issues.  The national organization has established a number of community programs and combined its resources with other organizations on philanthropic projects. The fraternity jointly leads programming initiatives with [[March of Dimes]], [[Head Start]], [[Boy Scouts of America]] and [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]].  The [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]], which Congress authorized in 1996 with Public Law 104-333, is a project of Alpha Phi Alpha.  

Members of Alpha Phi Alpha include former [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[Prime Minister]] and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] [[Norman Manley]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], former [[U.S. Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] [[Jesse Owens]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Thurgood Marshall]], former [[Atlanta, Georgia]] [[Mayor]]s [[Maynard Jackson]] and [[Andrew Young]], and numerous other American leaders are among the [[:Category:Alpha Phi Alpha brothers|men]] who have adopted the fraternity<U+2019>s principles&mdash;'''manly deeds, scholarship, and love for all mankind''.  

==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:Cornell Arts Quad 1919.jpg|right|thumb|The Arts Quad of [[Cornell University]] in 1919. Cornell was the site of the founding of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. in 1905 although the organization would remain unamed until 1906.]]
At the start of the 20th century, black students at American universities were often excluded from the personal and close associations the predominately [[Caucasian race|white]] student population enjoyed in fraternal organizations.<ref name=Wesley15-16> Wesley, Charles H. (1981). ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha, A Development in College Life'' p. 15.</ref>   During the 1905-06 school year at Cornell University, Alpha Phi Alpha was organized with the stated desire of providing a mechanism to build those associations and provide mutual support among African American students.  At the outset, there was disagreement about the group's purpose.  Some desired to organize a social and literary club where all persons could participate.  Others in the group supported a traditional fraternal organization.  The overwhelming sentiment was dissatisfaction with lack of access to a literary society and members proposed to enlarge the functions of the group. The fraternal supporters were in the minority and the society thereafter organized with the intention of providing a literary, study, social, and support group for all minority students who encountered social and academic racial prejudice.<ref> Wesley, ''op. cit.'', pp. 15-16.</ref> 

[[Image:411EStateStreet.jpg|right|thumb|125px|First meeting place of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 411 E. State Street in Ithaca, New York.]]
At the first meetings during the school year 1906-07, members formed the nucleus of the organization's internal structure for the yet unnamed "society."  On [[October 23]], 1906, Callis and Jones, acquainted with the [[Greek language]], proposed that the organization be known by the Greek letters, '''Alpha Phi Alpha''', and Ogle proposed the colors to be old gold and black. The fraternity was still in process of formation and the divisive issue of whether the terms "club" or "fraternity" be used was debated within the group.<ref name=Wesley19-27> Wesley, ''op. cit.'', pp. 19-27. </ref>

By December 4, 1906, the member's views changed and the decison was made to become a fraternity. The prior designations of "club," "organization," and "society" were removed.<ref name=Wesley19-27/>  The founding members of the first collegiate Greek letter organization for [[Negro]] students, with the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] as their symbol were Henry Callis, Charles Chapman, Eugene Jones, George Kelley, Nathaniel Murray, Robert Ogle and Vertner Tandy.<ref name=alphalegacy>{{cite web | url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/legacy/index.html | title=The Founders of Alpha Phi Alpha (<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> )&mdash;(''Seven Jewels'') |publisher=alphaphialpha.net | accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref><ref name=cornell-library>{{cite web | url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/alpha/ |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391>:A Brief History |publisher=rmc.library.cornell.edu |accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref>

===Consolidation and expansion===
[[Image:alphafstconvent.jpg|left|thumb|The first General Convention of Alpha Phi Alpha, held at Howard Univeristy in 1908.]]
Soon after the Cornell organization formed, members opened Alpha Phi Alpha chapters at other colleges and universities, many within [[Historically Black colleges and universities|historically black schools]].<ref name=alphagamma>{{cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Students/Alpha_Phi_Alpha/history.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A First General Convention |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Alpha Gamma Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref>  The fraternity's constitution was adopted on [[December 14]], 1907 and limited  membership to "Negro male" students.  The constitution also provided that the General Convention of the Fraternity would be created following the establishment of the fourth chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha. <ref name=USWW>{{cite web |url=http://apa.usww.com/alphatoc/frathistory.htm |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A Fraternity History |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Zeta Iota Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-14}}</ref>  
 
The [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] of [[New York]] accepted the incorporation of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity on [[January 29]], [[1908]]. The purpose and objective of the fraternity within these [[articles of incorporation]] was declared to be "educational and for the mutual uplift of its members."<ref name=USWW/>  In 1908, the fraternity became international when it chartered a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]] (although shortly thereafter the chapter became defunct).  The first general convention assembled in 1908 at Howard University in [[Washington, D.C]], producing the first ritual and the election of the first General President of Alpha Phi Alpha, Moses A. Morrison.<ref name=alphagamma/> 

[[Image:SphinxMagazine.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the 2000 edition of ''The Sphinx'' magazine, the fraternity's official jounral.]]
In 1914, ''The Sphinx<U+00AE>'', named after the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Egyptian landmark]], began publication as the fraternity's official journal.  Still published, the Sphinx is America's second oldest African American publication.<ref name=sphinxjournal>{{cite web |url=http://www.apa1906.net/news/sphinx/guidelines_authors.htm |title=The Sphinx Magazine |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref>  Only the [[NAACP]]'s ''[[The Crisis]]'', started by fraternity member [[W.E.B. DuBois]] in 1910 predates the Alpha publication.  The Fraternity was again incorporated on [[April 3]], [[1914]] within the District of Columbia.<ref name=USWW/> 

While continuing to stress academic excellence among its members, Alpha's leaders recognized the need to correct the educational, economic, political, and social injustices faced by African-Americans. <ref name=MPT>{{cite web |url=http://www.mpt.org/programsinterests/alpha/ |title=Alpha Phi Alpha Men: A Century of Leadership |publisher=Maryland Public Television |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

===History: 1919 - 1949===

The Fraternity's [[#National programs|national programs]] date back to 1919 with the "Go-To-[[High school|High School]], Go-to-[[University|College"]] campaign to promote academic achievement within  the African-American community being the first initiative. Alpha Phi Alpha would later participate in the [[Voting Rights Act|voting rights]] debate and coined the well-known phrase ''A Voteless People is a Hopeless People'' as part of its effort to register black voters. The slogan remains in Alpha Phi Alpha's continuing voter registration campaign.<ref name=epsilontheta>{{cite web |url=http://www.bgsu.edu/studentlife/greeks/alpha-phi-alpha/history.htm |title=History of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Epsilon Theta Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref>

During the Great Depression, Alpha Phi Alpha and its members continued to implement programs which it deemed affected the black community.  The New Negro Alliance (NNA) was founded in 1933 by fraternity brother [[Belford Lawson, Jr.]] in Washington D.C. to combat white-run business in black neighborhoods that would not hire black employees.  The NNA instituted a then-radical ''Don't Buy Where You Can't Work'' campaign, and organized or threatened [[boycott]]s against white-owned business.  In response, some businesses arranged for an injunction to stop the picketing.  NNA lawyers, including Lawson and Thurgood Marshall, fought back <U+2014> all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[New Negro Alliance v. Sanitary Grocery Co.]]''.<ref name=findlawNNA>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=303&invol=552 |title=NEW NEGRO ALLIANCE v. SANITARY GROCERY CO. |publisher=findlaw.com |accessdate=2006-05-01}}</ref> This became a [[Landmark decision|landmark case]] in the struggle by African Americans against [[Equal opportunity|discriminatory hiring]] practices, and ''Don't Buy Where You Can't Work'' groups multiplied throughout the nation. The NNA estimated that by 1940, the group had secured 5,106 jobs for blacks because businesses could not afford to lose sales during the depression.<ref name=ctdcNNA>{{cite web |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/info-url3948/info-url_show.htm?doc_id=212961&attrib_id=7970 |title=New Negro Alliance's Sanitary Grocery Protest Site |publisher=Cultural Tourism: District of Columbia |accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref>

[[Image:JesseOwens 1936Olympics.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Jesse Owens, saluting on the center dias, was one of three Alpha Phi Alpha members who participated in the [[1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin, Germany]].]]
The Committee on Public Policy was established at the 1933 general convention and took positions on issues many in the black community deemed important.  The first investigation of the committee was of the national government's [[New Deal]] agencies.  The committee's agenda was to determine the status of the black population, both as to treatment of agencies' employees and in the quality of services rendered to American blacks.<ref name=Wesley204-205> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 204-205.</ref>

At the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], three fraternity brothers represented the United States: Jesse Owens, [[Ralph Metcalfe]] and [[Dave Albritton]].<ref name=Wesley476> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 476.</ref>  Alpha Phi Alpha was continuing to expand and once again became an international organization as in 1938 it extended its roster of chapters to [[London]], [[England]].<ref name=Wesley239> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 239.</ref>

The 1940s were significant years for the fraternity as it sought to end racial discrimination in its own ranks and secure rights for its membership after the nation's entry into World War II.  The use of the word "Negro" in the membership clause of the constitution which referred to "any Negro male student" would be changed to read "any male student."  This  was the first official action by a black fraternity to allow the admission to men of all races.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', p. 244.</ref> The fraternity has been interracial since 1945.<ref name=multiracial>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/membership/aspirants.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Integrates the Fraternity |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

[[Image:AlphaROTC.jpg|left|thumb|The Training Camp at [[Des Moines, Iowa|Fort Des Moines]] during [[World War II]].  Alpha had the greatest representation of any organization or club at the camp and thirty-two Alpha men were granted commissions.]]

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Alpha men served in almost every branch of the [[Armed Forces|armed forces]] and civilian defense programs during World War II.  The type of [[War#Types of war and warfare|warfare]] encountered evidenced the nexus between education and war, with illiteracy decreasing a soldier's usefulness to the Army that could only be addressed with the inclusion of a large number of college educated men among the ranks of officers.  The Training Camp at [[Des Moines, Iowa|Fort Des Moines]] was the result of the fraternity's advocacy in convincing the government to create an officers<U+2019> training camp for black troops.  Thirty-two Alpha men were granted commissions (four were made [[Captain#Army and Marines|Captains]] and ninety percent were [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenants]]).  First Lieutenant Victor Daly was decorated with the [[Croix de guerre|Croix de Guerre]] for his service in [[France]].  The leadership of the fraternity encouraged Alpha men to buy [[war bond]]s, and the membership responded with their purchases.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', p. 248.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/alpha/greatwar/greatwar_1.html |title=Alpha Phi Alpha and the Great War |publisher=rmc.library.cornell.edu |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

===History: 1950 - 1969===

[[Image:alphamarch.jpg|thumb|left|Alpha Phi Alpha participates during the 1963 March on Washington.]]
The [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American civil rights movement]] coincided with Alpha Phi Alpha's 50th anniversary.  The fraternity's first "[[pilgrimage]]" to Cornell was held in 1956 to celebrate the [[Golden Jubilee]] and drew about 1,000 members who traveled by chartered train from [[Buffalo, New York]] to Ithaca.  Darryl R. Matthews Sr., general president of Alpha Phi Alpha in 2005, defined the [[#Centennial celebration|centennial pilgrimmage]] in a letter to members as; ''A pilgrimage is a personal, spiritual, historic and significant journey, which one takes to a place and for a purpose that has profound meaning to that individual''.<ref name=cornellnews>{{cite news |last=D'Andrea |first=Theresa |date=2005-11-05 |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/Alpha.Phi.Alpha.td.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Centennial Pilgrimage to Cornell University |publisher=Cornell News Service |accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref>  Fraternity brother Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered the [[keynote]] speech at the 50th anniversary banquet, chronicled in the documentary, ''Alpha Phi Alpha Men: A Century of Leadership''.

Alpha men were pioneers and at the forefront of the civil rights struggle.  In [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Dr. King led the people in the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] as a minister, and later as head of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).  [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] saw Arthur Shores organize for civil rights while Thurgood Marshall was engaging in the fight for [[Racial segregation|desegregation]] and integration in the landmark case of the United States Supreme Court, [[Brown v. Board of Education]].  Marshall employed mentor and fratenity brother [[Charles Hamilton Houston]]'s plan to use the ''de facto'' inequality of [[Equal Protection Clause|"separate but equal" education in the United States]] to attack and defeat the [[Jim Crow laws]].<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 366-369.</ref>  In 1961 [[Whitney Young]] became the executive director of the [[National Urban League]] (NUL) and in 1963, the NUL hosted the planning meetings of civil rights leaders for the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].  

In 1968, after the [[Martin Luther King, Jr.#Assassination|assassination]] of fraternity brother Martin Luther King, Jr., Alpha Phi Alpha proposed erecting a permanent memorial to King in Washington D.C. The efforts of the fraternity gained momentum in 1986 after King's birthday became a [[Martin Luther King Day|national holiday]] and led to the creation of ''The Washington D. C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, Inc'' to collect funds of $100 million for construction.<ref name=blkcoll>{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Butler T. |year=2006 |url=http://www.black-collegian.com/african/monument1299.shtml |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Proposes Permanent Memorial |publisher=black-collegian.com |accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref>

===History: 1970 - present===
Beginning in the 1970s, new goals were being introduced to address current environment.  The older social programs and policies were still supported, however; the fraternity turned its attention to new social needs.  This included the campaign to eliminate the [[Ghetto#Ghettos in the United States|ghetto-goal]] with the completion of three urban housing developments through Alpha Phi Alpha leadership in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]&mdash; the ''Alpha Gardens'', ''Alpha Towne'' and ''Alpha Village''.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', pp. 472-476. </ref>

In 1976, the fraternity celebrated its 70th Anniversary with dual convention locations: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. 

In 1981, the fraternity celebrated its [[Diamond Jubilee]] in [[Dallas, Texas]], featuring a presentation of the ''New Thrust Program'' consisting of the ''Million Dollar Fund Drive'' that contributed funds to the NAACP, the National Urban League, and the [[United Negro College Fund]] (UNCF).<ref> Mason, Herman "Skip" (1999). ''The Talented Tenth, The Founders and Presidents of Alpha'' p. 352. </ref>

In 1996, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to permit Alpha Phi Alpha to establish a memorial on Department of Interior lands in the District of Columbia.<ref name=mlkbill>{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/T?&report=sr190&dbname=104& |title=H.B. 104-190  |publisher=thomas.gov, A Bill to authorize the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity to establish a memorial in the District of Columbia to the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. |accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref>  While the project has created a good deal of controversy with regard to the Alpha's commitment to pay a fee to the King family, the memorial will be the first  to honor an African American in the [[National Mall]] and the second non-[[President of the United States|President]] to be commemorated in such a way. The [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]] is scheduled for completion in 2008 and will be located on a 4-acre site that borders the [[Tidal Basin]] and within the sightline of the [[Jefferson Memorial]] and [[Lincoln Memorial]].  The [[National Park Service]] will maintain the site.

Alpha Phi Alpha provides for charitable endeavors through the Fraternity's Education and Building Foundations, providing academic scholarships and shelter to underprivileged families. The Fraternity also has made commitments to train leaders with national mentoring programs.<ref name=USWW/>

Alpha Phi Alpha asserts "the Fraternity has supplied voice and vision to the struggle of African Americans and people of color around the world",<ref name=betasigma>{{cite web |url=http://www.hartfordalphas.com/alphaphialpha.php?ID=1 |title=Hartford Alumni Chapter |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Beta Sigma Lambda Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-04}}</ref> and it has established an ''Alpha Phi Alpha Archives'' at Howard University in Washington, D.C. to preserve the history of the organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edonline.com/taulambda/natlprograms.htm |title=Preservation of Alpha Phi Alpha History |publisher=Education Online |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>

The first chapter established at Cornell University is named ''Alpha'' chapter.  The second, ''Beta'', established at [[Howard University]] in 1907 made Alpha Phi Alpha the first [[black (people)|black]] greek organization to charter a  chapter on a historically black college campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nphchq.org/about.htm |title=National PanHellenic Council Aboutpage |publisher=NPHC |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  Beginning in 1908, Howard became the founding site for five additional NPHC members.  [[Ethel Hedgeman Lyle]] was inspired by her then high school and college sweetheart George Lyle, a co-founder of Alpha's Howard chapter, to establish [[Alpha Kappa Alpha|Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]].<ref name=skip2>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Herman "Skip"  |date=1999-04-16 |url=http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm02.htm |title=The ties that bind |publisher=skipmason.com |accessdate=2006-05-09}}</ref>  [[Omega Psi Phi]] (1911), [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (1913), [[Phi Beta Sigma]] (1914) and [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (1920), established their ''Alpha'' chapter at Howard University.  The fraternity established ''Alpha Lambda'' its first graduate [[Alumnus/a|alumni]] chapter in 1911 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

The fraternity's international scope was established early. In 1908 it chartered undergraduate chapter ''Delta'' at University of Toronto; shortly thereafter, the chapter became defunct. Its seat was transferred to what is now [[Huston-Tillotson University]] in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1939. In 1938, the fraternity chartered ''Beta Psi'' college chapter in [[London]], England. The ''Theta Theta Lambda'' alumni chapter was chartered in 1963 at [[Frankfurt]], Germany. Other chapters have been chartered in Monrovia, Liberia, the [[Caribbean]] and [[South Korea]]. <ref name=epsilontheta />

''Omega'' chapter was distinguished to contain the names of deceased fraternity members.  [[Frederick Douglass]] became an honorary member of the fraternity's Omega chapter in 1921, enjoying the distinction of being the only member initiated posthumously.<ref name=rhosigma>{{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/~aphia/newsite/famousas.html |title=Frederick Douglass, first Honorary member of Alpha Phi Alpha |publisher=Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Rho Sigma Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-03}}</ref>

===Pledging===
[[Image:Alphapledges.jpg|left|thumb|<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Pledge Line]]
The pledge period is the time that a potential new member of the fraternity engages in before being initiated as a brother.  This period is the time the [[Pledge#Initiant|pledge]] learns of the organization's history, principles, and tenancity of brotherhood.

In the selection of candidates for membership, certain chapters had not escaped challenges of racial stereotyping and allegations of [[colorism]].  In a biography of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the authors recounted how certain chapters of the fraternity used a "brown paper bag test" and would not consider students whose skin color was darker than the bag.<ref>Davis, Michael D., ''et al.'' (2001). ''Thurgood Marshall: Warrior of the Bar, Rebel on the Bench''. Ch. 7.</ref>  Former General President Belford Lawson, Jr. lamented this attitude and condemned initiation practices of snobbery and exclusivity, and said "[[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] could not make Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity today; they would [[Blackball (blacklist)|blackball]] Him because He was not ''hot enough''".<ref>Mason 1999, ''op. cit.'', p. 295.</ref>

There are periods in the history of the fraternity where hazing was involved in certain pledge lines.  The fraternity has never officially condoned hazing, but has been aware of problems with "rushing" and "initiations" dated as far back as the 1934 General Convention when the fraternity founders communicated their concern with physical violence in initiation ceremonies.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', p. 214.</ref>  At the 1940 General Convention, a pledge manual was discussed that would contain a brief general history, the list of chapters and locations, the achievements of Alpha men, outstanding Alpha men, and pledge procedures.<ref> Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', p. 242.</ref>

In 2001, the chapter at Ohio State University was suspended for two years by both the university and the national Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity for hazing and other violations.  The incident involved two prospective members injured seriously enough to require medical care.<ref name=OSU>{{cite news |date=2001-01-11 |url=http://www.osu.edu/osu/newsrel/Archive/01-01-11_Fraternity_Suspended_Due_to_Hazing.html |title=University, national group sanction Alpha Phi Alpha |publisher=Ohio State News |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  

Many hazing incidents have resulted in [[Lawsuit|civil actions]]; that and the objections of parents, students and fraternity alumni, prompted Alpha Phi Alpha to implement its current policy&mdash;abolishing pledging as a means of obtaining membership.  The fraternity's official policy is that hazing is against the purposes and goals of the Fraternity and has been discontinued as a condition or manner of initiation into the membership of Alpha Phi Alpha. It is no longer legal within the organization for members to establish a pledge line or to require aspirants to the organization to submit to hazing. All membership intake activities for the fraternity are conducted by the National Intake Office and must occur in the presence of a National Intake Officer.<ref name=alphaintake>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/membership/policy.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> Membership Intake Policy |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

[[Image:H_Humphrey.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Alpha Phi Alpha member [[Hubert Humphrey|Hubert H. Humphrey]]]]
The fraternity provides classifications for honorary and exalted honorary membership; one of the highest honors that Alpha Phi Alpha can bestow upon a person who has not obtained membership through the traditional pledge program.  Honorary members include Vice President Hubert Humphrey (who is Caucasian), jazz musician [[Duke Ellington]], and activist W.E.B. DuBois.<ref>Wesley 1981, ''op. cit.'', p. 81, 116 & 453. </ref>

From the ranks of the fraternity have come a number of pioneers in various fields. Honorary member [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]] was the first African-American to be admitted to [[Johns Hopkins University]]. [[Todd Duncan]] was the first actor to play "Porgy" in [[Porgy and Bess]].  During the Washington run of Porgy and Bess in 1936, the cast&mdash;as led by Todd Duncan&mdash;protested the audience's segregation.  Duncan stated that he "would never play in a theater which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race." Eventually management would give into the demands and allow for the first integrated performance at [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theatre]].<ref name=libcong1>{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/sep02.html |title=Porgy and Bess: Today in History, September 2 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  [[Kunle Fagbenle]] is the first lawyer of [[Nigeria]]n descent in the United States to receive a Legal Excellence Award conferred by the Maryland Bar Foundation.

Charles Houston, a [[Harvard Law School]] graduate and a law professor at Howard University, first began a campaign in the 1930s to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts.  Houston's campaign to fight Jim Crow Laws began with [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] and culminated in a unanimous Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education.

Martin Luther King, Jr. was the recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Spingarn Medal]], and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], awarded posthumously by President [[Jimmy Carter]].  The Presidential Medal of Freedom has also been awarded to members [[William T. Coleman, Jr.|William Coleman]] and [[Edward Brooke]].  The Spingarn Medal, awarded annually by the NAACP for outstanding achievement by a Black American, has been awarded to brothers [[John Hope Franklin]], [[Rayford Logan]] and numerous fraternity members.  The [[Congressional Gold Medal of Honor]], the highest civilian award of the [[United States Congress]] was awarded to Jesse Owens and Vice President Hubert Humphrey.  Prime Minister Norman Manley was a [[Rhodes Scholarship#Notable Rhodes Scholarship recipients|Rhodes Scholar]] (1914), awarded annually by the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] based Rhodes Trust on the basis of academic achievement and character.  Andrew Zawacki, a white man, is a second Rhodes Scholar recipient.  

A number of [[:Category:Buildings and Monuments Honoring Alpha Phi Alpha Men|buildings and monuments]] have been named after Alpha men such as the [[Eddie Robinson Stadium]], [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]], The [[University of Minnesota#Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs|Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]] and its building, the Hubert H. Humphrey Center, and the W.E.B. DuBois library at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst#Libraries|University of Massachusetts Amherst]].  The [[United States Postal Service]] has honored fraternity members W.E.B. Dubois, Duke Ellington, Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, [[Paul Robeson]] and Jesse Owens with a [[commemorative stamp]] in their popular Black Heritage Stamp series.<ref name=USPS>{{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/blackhis/stamps.htm |title=USPS Black Heritage Stamp series |publisher=United States Postal Service |accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref>

==Egyptian symbolism==
[[Image:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Alpha Phi Alpha chose to use Egyptian symbology more representative of the member's [[Africa]]n heritage. The [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] and [[Khafre's Pyramid|Pyramid]] are fraternity icons.]]

Alpha Phi Alpha utilizes motifs from Ancient Egypt and uses images and songs depicting the Sphinx, pharaohs, and other [[Egypt]]ian artifacts to represent the organization.  This is in contrast to other fraternities that traditionally echo themes from the golden age of [[Ancient Greece]]. <ref name=munualphas>{{cite web |url=http://www.munualphas.com/part4.html |title=Black sponsored Greek letter organization |publisher=Alphi Phi Alpha Fraternity, Mu Nu Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  The Heremakhet and Alpha's constant reference to [[Ethiopia]] in hymns and poems are further examples of Alpha's mission to imbue itself with an African cultural heritage.  Fraternity brother [[Charles H. Wesley]] wrote, "To the Alpha Phi Alpha brotherhood, African history and civilization, the Sphinx, and Ethiopian tradition bring new meanings and these are interpreted with new significance to others."<ref name=munualphas />  Pharaoh often appears and is a title used to refer to the Egyptian [[god-king]]s.

The pyramid is also another common symbol and is another African image of Alpha Phi Alpha and is utilized as a symbol of foundation, sacred geometry and more."<ref name=munualphas />   

Fraternity members organize travel to Egypt to walk across the sands to the Sphinx and the [[Giza pyramid complex|Pyramids]].  Charles H. Wesley wrote, "I have stood beside the Sphinx in Egypt in Africa in July on my third visit there, and I brought greetings to this silent historical figure in the name of Alpha Phi Alpha and I crossed the continent to Ethiopia." <ref> Mason 1999, ''op.cit.'', p. 273 </ref>

==National programs==

The Alpha's national office is located in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Darryl R. Matthews, Sr. holds the elective office of General President and  Willard C. Hall, Jr. is the Executive Director appointed by the General Convention.  The national office is tasked with overall fraternity supervision and program management.

===Go-To-High School, Go-To-College=== 
Established in 1922, the Go-To-High School, Go-To-College program is intended to afford Alpha men with the opportunity to provide young participants with role models.  The program concentrates on the importance of completing secondary and collegiate education as a path to advancement and to provide information and strategies to facilitate success.<ref name=highcollege>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/programs/gotohighschool.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A Go - To - High School, Go - To - College Program |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-05}}</ref>

===Voter Education/Registration Program===
[[Image:Seven Architects.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The "A Voteless People is a Hopeless People" campaign poster was produced in the 1930s to raise awareness of the voting problems that African-Americans faced.]]
"A Voteless People is a Hopeless People" was initiated as a National Program of Alpha during the 1930s when many African-Americans had the right to vote but were prevented from voting because of poll taxes, threats of reprisal, and lack of education about the voting process. Voter education and registration has since remained a dominant focus in the fraternity's planning. In the 1990s the focus has shifted to promotion of political awareness and empowerment, delivered most often through use of town meetings and candidate forums.<ref name=voterpgm>{{cite web |url=http://www.alphaphialpha.net/alpha/today/programs/voteless.html |title=<U+0391><U+03A6>A Voter Registration Program |publisher=alphaphialpha.net |accessdate=2006-04-06}}</ref>

The fraternity's Nu Mu Lambda chapter of [[Decatur, Georgia]], held a voter registration drive in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]] in 2004, from which [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] Secretary of State [[Cathy Cox]], rejected all 63 voter registration applications on the basis that the fraternity did not follow correct procedures, including obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive.  Nu Mu Lambda filed ''Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox'' on the basis that the Georgia Secretary of State's long-standing policy and practice of rejecting mail-in voter registration applications that were submitted in bundles and/or by persons other than registrars, deputy registrars, or the individual applicants, violated the requirements of the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (NVRA) by undermining voter registration drives.  A Senior [[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, which also found private entities have a right under the NVRA, to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.<ref name=nvra>{{cite news |last=Epting |first=Sarah  |date=2006-03-10 |url=http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/news/0034.html |title=Cox Violated Voter Rights, Judge Declares |publisher=Atlanta Progressive News, The Wesley Foundation is the Georgia nonprofit charitable affiliate of Nu Mu Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. |accessdate=2006-05-25}}</ref>

===Project Alpha===
Alpha Phi Alpha and the March of Dimes began a collaborative program called ''Project Alpha'' in 1980. The project  consists of a series of workshops and informational sessions conducted by Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity brothers to provide young men with current and accurate information about [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]] prevention.<ref name=MarchofDimes>{{cite web |url=http://www.marchofdimes.com/howtohelp/644_1425.asp |title=March of Dimes: Alpha Phi Alpha |publisher=March of Dimes |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref> 
Alpha Phi Alpha also participates in the March of Dimes ''WalkAmerica'' and raised over $95,000 in 2004.<ref name=MarchofDimes />

===Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial=== 
{{Main|Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial}}
[[Image:Washington mlk map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Location for the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]]. The project to create a memorial to Dr. King on the [[National Mall]] is being driven by Alpha Phi Alpha.]]
The campaign to erect a permanent memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the fraternity.<ref name=mlkalphanews /> In 1998, Congress authorized and President [[Bill Clinton]] confirmed  the fraternity's request to establish a foundation (The ''Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial Project  Foundation'')  to manage the memorial's fundraising, design and construction.<ref name=mlkalphanews/>  The fraternity laid a marble and bronze plaque to dedicate the memorial site on December 4, 2000.  In 2001, Dr. King's family stood in the path of the foundation's efforts to erect the memorial, because the family wanted the foundation to pay a licensing fee for the right to use King's image.  The foundation, beset with languid donations, has stated the last thing it needs is to have to pay an onerous license fee to the King family.  "If nobody's going to make money off of it, why should anyone get a fee?" ''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted [[Joseph Lowery]], past president of the King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fears |first=Darryl |date=2002-04-08 |url=http://www.jessejacksonjr.org/query/creadpr.cgi?id=%22005227%22 |title=Entrepreneurship Or Profiteering? |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2006-06-06}}</ref>  The [[groundbreaking]] is scheduled to coincide with the centenary of the fraternity.  The fraternity's goal is to dedicate the Memorial in 2008 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of King's death.<ref>{{cite news |last=Koch |first=Wendy |date=2006-01-06 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-01-12-mlk-memorial_x.htm |title=Organizers of MLK memorial quicken pace to get slain leader among greats |publisher=USA Today, King is one of ten 20th-century Christian [[martyr]]s from across the world depicted in statues above the Great West Door of [[Westminister Abbey]]. |accessdate=2006-06-06}}</ref>

===Pan-Hellenic membership===
{{Main|National Pan-Hellenic Council}} {{Main|North-American Interfraternity Conference}}
The fraternity maintains dual membership in the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) and the North-American Interfraternity Conference (NIC).  The NPHC is composed of nine international black Greek-letter sororities and fraternities, and Alpha Phi Alpha is the only member founded at an [[Ivy League]] school.  The council promotes interaction through forums, meetings, and other mediums for the exchange of information, and engages in cooperative programming and initiatives through various activities and functions.<ref name=NPHC>{{cite web |url=http://www.nphchq.org/home.htm |title=National Pan-Hellenic Council Homepage |publisher=NPHC |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  The NIC serves to advocate the needs of its member fraternities through enrichment of the fraternity experience; advancement and growth of the fraternity community; and enhancement of the educational mission of the host institutions.<ref name=NIC>{{cite web |url=http://www.nicindy.org/ |title=North-American Interfraternity Conference |publisher=NIC |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

==Centennial celebration==
Alpha Phi Alpha has declared 2006 the beginning of its "Centennial Era" to celebrate its [[Centennial|100th anniversary]].  These preparations will culminate with the Centennial Convention, consisting of nationwide activities and events including the commissioning of intellectual and scholarly works, presentation of exhibits, lectures, artwork and musical expositions, and the production of film and video presentations scheduled for July 25 - 30, 2006 in [[Washington, D.C.]].  The Centennial Era is to be framed by the [[slogan]] ''First of All, Servants of All, We Shall Transcend All''.  

[[Image:APhiA Cornell 007.jpg|left|thumb|<U+0391><U+03A6>A General Presidents at centennial memorial site, Cornell University campus.]]
The ''2006 Centennial Celebration Kickoff'' launched with another "pilgrimage" to Cornell University on [[November 19]], [[2005]].  That event brought over 700 fraternity members who gathered for a day long program.  Members journeyed across campus and unveiled a new centennial memorial to Alpha Phi Alpha.  The memorial&mdash;a wall in the form of a "'''J'''" in recognition of the ''Jewels''&mdash;features a bench and a plaque and is situated in front of the university's Barnes Hall. <ref name=cornellnews /> 

''Alpha Phi Alpha Men: A Century of Leadership'', is a historical [[Documentary film|documentary]] on Alpha Phi Alpha's century of leadership and service. The film premiered February 2006 on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]<ref name=MPT/> as part of the 2006 [[Black History Month]] theme, "Celebrating Community: A Tribute to Black Fraternal, Social and Civic Institutions."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asalh.org/ThemeIntro.html |title=The 2006 Black History Theme |publisher=Association for the Study of African
American Life and History |accessdate=2006-04-08}}</ref>

==The first black fraternity?==
[[Image:alphahistorybook.gif|right|thumb|The cover of ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha''.]]
There is some dispute as to whether Alpha Phi Alpha was the first black fraternity.  Black-sponsored Greek letter organizations may have begun in 1903 on the [[Indiana University Bloomington]] campus, but there were too few registrants to assure continuing organization. In that year a club was formed called Alpha Kappa Nu Greek Club to "strengthen the black's voice", but the club disappeared after a short time. There is no record of any similar organization at Indiana University until [[Kappa Alpha Psi|Kappa Alpha Nu]] was issued a charter in 1911.<ref name=munualphas/><ref name=germantown>{{cite web |url=http://www.germantownalumni.org/fraternity |title=The History of Kappa Alpha Psi |publisher=Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Germantown Alumni Chapter |accessdate=2006-04-26}}</ref>  Two of the founders had prior interaction with Alpha Phi Alpha and its Beta chapter while students at Howard University before transferring to Indiana University.<ref name=skip8>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Herman "Skip" |date=1999-04-26 |url=http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm08.htm |title=Revisionist Fraternities: The Omega, Kappa, Sigma Conspiracy |publisher=skipmason.com |accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref>

Sigma Pi Phi, founded in 1904, has also claimed to be the first although many argue this is a [[wiktionary:misnomer|misnomer]]. Sigma was founded as an organization for professionals and college graduates and ''not'' as an organization of black college students.<ref name=munualphas />  <ref name=skip19>{{cite web |last=Mason |first=Herman "Skip" |date=1999-05-11 |url=http://www.skipmason.com/hm/hm19.htm |title=<U+0391><U+03A6><U+0391> and Sigma Pi Phi (<U+03A3><U+03A0><U+03A6>) |publisher=skipmason.com |accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref> Historian Charles H. Wesley, a member of both Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi, authored ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha, A Development in College Life'' and ''The History of Sigma Pi Phi'' and asserts that Alpha Phi Alpha was the first Greek-letter organization among black college men.<ref>Wesley, Charles H. (1950). ''The History of Alpha Phi Alpha: A Development in Negro College Life'' (Foundation Publishers).</ref>

Alpha Phi Alpha claims its historical position as the first intercollegiate Greek-letter fraternity in the United States established for men of African descent, and the [[wiktionary:paragon|paragon]] for NPHC members.<ref name=USWW/>  The history books of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], Omega Psi Phi and Phi Beta Sigma omit the fraternity's place and contribution to the college Negro fraternal movement.  Historian and Alpha archivist Herman Mason has stated, "As a historian who recognizes that laying a foundation for any period of history, I find their omission inexcusable and without merit." <ref name=skip8/>
