The '''2003 British Grand Prix''' was a [[Formula One]] race held on 20 July at the [[Silverstone Circuit]].

It was won by [[pole position|polesitter]] [[Rubens Barrichello]] but is probably most well-known for a track invasion by the [[defrocking|defrocked]] priest [[Neil Horan]], who ran along Hangar straight, running opposite to the 280 km/h train of cars, wearing a saffron kilt and waving religious banners.<ref name=BBC1> {{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Legard |title=A very British curse

== Race report ==
The race began with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]'s [[Rubens Barrichello]] on pole, alongside [[Renault F1]]'s [[Jarno Trulli]]. [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]] of [[McLaren-Mercedes]] started from third, while world champion and championship leader [[Michael Schumacher]] started from fifth. Barrichello made a poor start, allowing both Trulli and R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen past on an incident-free first lap. Ralf and Michael Schumacher retained their starting positions of fourth and fifth. On the sixth lap, the headrest of [[David Coulthard]] dislodged while traversing the first corner (Copse), forcing him to [[pit stop|pit]] for a replacement under safety regulations, and causing a [[safety car]] period to allow marshals to clear the track. Upon the resumption of [[racing flags|green flag]] racing, Barrichello closed the gap to R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen before passing him on lap 11. On the following lap, [[Neil Horan]] invaded the circuit and another safety car period was necessitated. As it was close to the period when the drivers would be making their scheduled pit stops, the vast majority of cars decided to pit under the safety car. The second placed cars from the respective teams were forced to queue up in the pit lane waiting for service, causing them to drop many places. Michael Schumacher, [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] were all outside of the top ten. Of the leading contenders, Trulli was in fourth place while both R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen and Ralf Schumacher had jumped Barrichello when in the pits.

The [[Toyota F1|Toyota]]s of [[Cristiano da Matta]] and [[Olivier Panis]]{{ndash}} who had opted not to pit{{ndash}} were leading, while Coulthard was in third, having not required a pit stop after his earlier unscheduled headrest replacement. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen passed Trulli immediately after the restart before clearing team-mate Coulthard on the same lap. Barrichello then passed a slowing Ralf Schumacher on the 17th lap while R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen also passed Panis before chasing down the leading da Matta. Ralf Schumacher was forced to pit after encountering difficulties, while at the same time Michael Schumacher was unable to pass Alonso. By the 26th lap Barrichello was still trying to pass Trulli, and the two leaders continued to extend their lead. Barrichello and Montoya eventually pass Trulli by the end of the 27th lap, before Panis fell victim to both on the 29th. Da Matta eventually ceded the lead after pitting on the 30th lap to R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen. Barrichello then set the fastest lap after being cleared of traffic, taking the lead after R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen pitted for the second time. Barrichello continued to cut the advantage, but R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen regained the lead with a reduced margin following the Brazilian's second stop. After closing in, Barrichello passed R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen after pressuring him into a mistake. Michael Schumacher eventually passed Trulli on the 46th lap, but an unforced error by R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen allowed Montoya to seize second position. In the closing phase of the race, Coulthard passes both da Matta and Trulli to earn fifth place.<ref name=BBC2> {{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Benson |title=Silverstone joy for Barrichello |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3081859.stm |format= |publisher=BBC Sports |date=2003-07-20 |accessdate=26 August 2006}}</ref><ref name=BBC3>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Lapwatch: British GP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/3081587.stm

== Track invasion ==
[[Image:Silverstone horan.jpg|thumb|right|Horan runs onto the track into the path of [[Ant<U+00F4>nio Pizzonia]]'s [[Jaguar R4]]. Caption on this television screenshot indicates deployment of safety car as a result.]]
On the 11th lap, as the procession of cars exited the Becketts corner onto the Hangar straight, Horan cleared the fence wearing a kilt, waving banners with statements "Read the bible" and "The Bible is always right"<ref name=NewSeekers>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=The new seekers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3242953.stm |format= |publisher=BBC Sports |date=2003-11-05 |accessdate=26 August 2006}}</ref> and ran towards the sequence of cars, forcing several cars to swerve to avoid him. He eventually returned to the grass runoff area at the side of the track after the cars had passed for the lap, and was stopped by a track marshal.

He was later charged with aggravated trespass and pleaded guilty in a [[Northampton]] court,<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Ex-priest admits Grand Prix invasion
|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/northamptonshire/3142515.stm |format= |publisher=BBC Sports |date=2003-08-11 |accessdate=26 August 2006}}&nbsp;</ref> stating that he took the open gate as a sign from [[God]], although the prosecution contended that his act was premeditated as he had already prepared the banners prior to attending the Grand Prix. He was later jailed for two months.<ref name=NewSeekers/>

The incident prompted comparisons to the events at the [[1977 South African Grand Prix]], where volunteer track marshal, [[Jansen Van Vuuren]], ran across the main straight to aid a car and was hit at 170mph by [[Tom Pryce]], who couldn't see him until it was too late because of the steep crest on the straight. Both Van Vuuren and Pryce were killed by the impact. A similar incident occurred at the [[2000 German Grand Prix]] when a disgruntled ex-Mercedes employee walked along part of the circuit in protest before being arrested. This caused a safety car, which eliminated the lead of [[Mika H<U+00E4>kkinen]], driving for McLaren Mercedes. Unlike the German protester, Horan ran directly down the middle of the track, and intentionally towards oncoming cars and lurching towards some of them.

The race led to fears that [[Formula One]] bosses [[Max Mosley]] and [[Bernie Ecclestone]], who had been highly critical of the media and corporate facilities of Silverstone, would use the incident to drop the race from the Formula One calendar, with Ecclestone saying "It wasn't necessary - the race was exciting enough without it. But the security wasn't good enough". However, drivers and team officials defended the circuit, with Montoya stating "This was one of the best races of the year, even with the spectator. It was so much fun today," and [[Sauber]] boss [[Peter Sauber]] stated "When a man sets himself on fire in the street in Paris, no one blames Paris", while [[McLaren-Mercedes]] boss [[Ron Dennis]] said "There is no way you can prevent it happening".<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew|last=Benson|title=Ex-priest admits Grand Prix invasion
