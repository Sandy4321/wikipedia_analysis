==Plot==
When [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] try unsuccessfully to get [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to speak, Marge decides to tell story of Lisa's first word. In March 1983, Homer, Marge, and a young Bart are living in the Lower East side of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. One day, Marge announces to Homer and Bart that she is [[pregnant]] with another baby. When asked what he thinks, Bart imagines a new [[brother]] whom he can use as a [[scapegoat]] for his own misbehavior. Marge suggests to Homer that with their family expanding, they need a bigger house. Homer and Marge try to look for houses, and find [[742 Evergreen Terrace|a perfect house on Evergreen Terrace]] and buy it with a [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 down payment from the sale of [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa Simpson's]] house.

In 1984, Bart is two-years old, the Simpsons move into their new Evergreen Terrace home, with the [[Flanders family]] as neighbors. Bart turns two years old, and for the first time, he watches ''[[Krusty the Clown]]'', as well as ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]''. Krusty begins a promotion for the [[1984 Summer Olympic Games]] with his [[Krusty Burger]] chain, the promotion is a scratch-and-win game in which people scratch off the name of the event from the game card and if the [[United States|U.S.]] wins a gold medal in that chosen event, that person would win a free Krusty Burger. However, the game cards are rigged so they only contain events in which "communists always win". But when the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet Union-led boycott]] occurs, Krusty loses millions of dollars and Homer receives a steady supply of Krusty Burgers.

Bart is now asked to give up his crib so it can become the new baby's. Bart refuses, so Homer builds Bart a new bed shaped like a maniacal clown, which terrifies Bart into a state of [[insomnia]]. Marge thinks that the baby is coming, and she and Homer go to the hospital, leaving Bart with the Flanders family. Bart returns home and is scared until Homer asks him to see Lisa, to whom Bart takes an immediate dislike. Everyone, except Bart, agrees that she is a beautiful baby. Later, Bart does bad things to Lisa &mdash; such as cutting all of her hair with household scissors, sticking stamps on her and putting her in a mailbox, and putting her through the Flanders' doggy door &mdash; and is punished each time by being put in the corner. He blames Lisa for his problems and packs his toys into a hobo's bindle, about to run away for good until Lisa says her first word, "Bart". Bart discovers that Lisa can talk, and loves him and appears to accept her as his little sister. Homer, however is secretly disappointed that none of his kids said "daddy".

Back in present day, the flashback ends with Bart and Lisa fighting. Homer takes Maggie to bed, commenting on how kids learn to talk back as soon as they learn to talk. As he puts Maggie to bed, Homer wishes that Maggie never says a word. As soon as Homer leaves the room, Maggie removes her pacifier, utters the word "daddy", and falls asleep.

In the episode, Homer builds a scary clown shaped bed for Bart. The scene was inspired by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it.<ref name="Kirkland"/> As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s song "[[Girls Just Want To Have Fun]]", which was released the same year.<ref name="variety"/> The idea for this sequence came from [[animation director]] [[Chuck Sheetz]], who suggested it because the length of the final version of the episode was too short.<ref name="Martin"/>

The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[censor]]s wrote a note concerning Homer's line, "Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!" after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered "coarse," due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.<ref name="Turner">{{cite book| last = Turner| first = Chris| title =[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]| page =20| id = ISBN 0-679-31318-4}}</ref>

Maggie's first word was provided by the [[Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Elizabeth Taylor]], who would also voice herself in the episode "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]", which aired as the [[season finale]] of the fourth season. While promoting the episode, the producers initially did not reveal who the voice of Maggie would be, prompting speculation as the identity of the actress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311750,00.html|title=Face to Face: Maggie Simpson |accessdate=2008-01-19|author=Lisa Schwarzbaum |date=1992-09-11|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref> Although it was only one word, the voice came out too sexy and Taylor had to record the part numerous times before the producers were satisfied and thought it sounded like a baby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2007/05/04/2007-05-04_at_film_fest_de_niros_lashed_picture_sho-2.html|title=In the Fox family, they live in fear of a Bart attack|author=George Rush and Joanna Rush Molloy |accessdate=2008-07-31|date=2007-05-04|publisher=''New York Daily News''}}</ref><ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2004|title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Lisa's First Word"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==="Can't sleep, clown will eat me"===
[[Image:Bedclown.jpg|thumb|Bart imagines the clown face on the headboard is coming to life.]]Inspired by an event in Simpsons writer Mike Reiss's childhood, young Bart does not want to give up sleeping in the crib to make way for his newborn sister. Noticing Bart's affection for [[Krusty the Clown]], Homer decides to build a clown-themed bed to please his son. However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on a sinister appearance and frightens Bart, especially in the darkened room. In his first night in the new bed, far from "laughing himself to sleep", Bart imagines that the face on the [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]] of the bed is coming to life, intoning with sinister glee, "[[Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep|if you should die before you wake...]]", before collapsing into evil cackling. 

The next morning, Bart is curled up into the [[fetal position]] on the floor next to the sofa downstairs, repeatedly uttering the phrase "can't sleep, clown will eat me...". The catchphrase inspired the [[Alice Cooper]] song "Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me" from the 2001 album ''[[Dragontown]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/AT/lib00059,117508302B023D18.html|title=Some pop culture creations demonize the red-nosed men |accessdate=2008-01-19|date=2007-02-15|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}</ref> The phrase has since found its way into popular use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7191721.stm|title=Why are clowns scary? |author=Finlo Rohrer|accessdate=2008-01-19|date=2008-01-16|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>
