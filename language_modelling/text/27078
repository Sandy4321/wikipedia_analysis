The '''Royal National College for the Blind''' (RNC) is a co-educational [[residential college]] of [[further education]] based in the English city of [[Hereford]]. Students who attend the college are [[blindness|blind]] or partially sighted. Students can study a wide range of qualifications at RNC, from academic subjects such as [[English (language)|English]] and [[Mathematics]] to more vocational topics like [[Performing Arts]]. Alongside regular further education subjects and vocational training, the college offers training in independent living and personal development. In 2008, there were 196 students whose ages ranged from 16 upwards.

Founded in 1871 in [[London]] as The Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, the college had a number of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford, and was renamed Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the education of visually impaired people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for visually impaired students in the United Kingdom to have been awarded [[Beacon Status]] in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning. RNC is the home of the first football academy for visually impaired players and the England [[blind football]] team, and the host of the [[2010 IBSA World Blind Football Championship|2010 World Blind Football Championship]]. It will also act as a training facility for participants in the [[2012 Paralympic Games]]. The college is actively involved in the development of [[assistive technology]] to help visually impaired people in their day to day lives. Two notable devices developed at RNC are the [[Mountbatten Brailler]], an electronic braille writer, and the [[Talking Tactile Tablet|T3]], a talking tactile device which helps with the reading of maps and diagrams.

RNC has had thirteen principals since it was founded, the present being Geoff Draper, a former Colonel in the British Army who was appointed to the position on 7 December 2009. The appointment comes after a controversial period in the college's history  which saw dramatic departmental restructuring and changes to some of the courses which were being offered to students, as well as a significant redevelopment and modernisation of the Hereford campus. The campus, located on College Road, Hereford, is home to RNC's teaching, residential and leisure facilities. Students live in halls of residence or on-campus houses which enable them to gain a level of independence within the college environment. RNC operates a leisure facility, thePoint4, which is open to the public. The National [[BlindArt]] collection is housed at RNC.

The college is a registered charity, its current [[Patronage#Charity|Patron]] being [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. There are also several high profile supporters. RNC has a number of notable people among its alumni, including former Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]]. The college was the subject of a 2007 film for the [[Channel 4]] ''[[Cutting Edge (Channel 4 TV series)|Cutting Edge]]'' documentary strand which follows three students through their first term of study. The film was the winner of a 2008 [[Royal Television Society]] Award.

===Early years===

The college was established in 1871 by the English philanthropist [[Thomas Armitage|Thomas Rhodes Armitage]] and the American anti-slavery campaigner [[Francis Joseph Campbell]], who lost his sight as a young boy.<ref name="RNC">{{cite web|url= http://www.the-palace-mag.co.uk/?p=92|title= The Royal Normal College|first= Jerry|last= Green|publisher= Crystal Palace Magazine|date= 1 April 2007|accessdate= 13 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="Tennessee">{{cite web|url= http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=C019|publisher= Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture|title= Biography of Francis Joseph Campbell|accessdate= 27 January 2010}}</ref> Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London would be a more suitable location.<ref name=Illingworth126-7>{{Harvnb|Illingworth|1910|p=126-7}}</ref> At the time English schools for the blind did not provide their students with the skills to become independent, and dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.<ref name=Perkins>{{cite web|url= http://perkins.pvt.k12.ma.us/museum/section.php?id=211|title= Famous People|publisher= Perkins School for the Blind History Museum|accessdate= 15 February 2010}}</ref>

With donations of <U+00A3>3,000,<ref name=Perkins/> the college enroled its first two students on 1 March 1872.<ref name=History/> [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] became its first Patron,<ref name=Illingworth129>{{Harvnb|Illingworth|1910|p=129}}</ref> while several prominent members of her family became Vice-Patrons.<ref name=Illingworth129/> Among those to become governors of the college were the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], [[Thomas Anson, 2nd Earl of Lichfield|Lord Lichfield]] and the Right Hon. [[William Henry Smith (politician)|W. H. Smith]], M.P.<ref name=Illingworth129/> At the time of its founding it was called "The Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind", the word ''[[Normal school|Normal]]'' being an [[American English|American]] expression referring to teacher training offered by the college,<ref name=RNC/> with Campbell recruiting many of his teaching staff from the United States.<ref name=History/>

Originally located in two small buildings on Anerley Hill near London's [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], the college later moved to larger accommodation at Westow Street, [[Upper Norwood]] after rapidly outgrowing its original premises.<ref name="RNC"/> In its early days, the college was considered very progressive and experimental in its approach to education.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url= http://www.rncb.ac.uk/aboutus/history.shtml|title= A brief history of RNC|publisher= Royal National College for the Blind|accessdate= 27 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="Newsquest"/> A history of the college on its website describes the curriculum as "liberal and advanced for its day",<ref name="History"/> and emphasis was placed on physical activities such as swimming, cycling and roller-skating.<ref name=Newsquest/> Students even took part in a morning of tobogganing following a heavy fall of snow.<ref name=Newsquest/> By the end of the 19th century, the college had over 200 students.<ref name="History"/> Before the [[Second World War]], the college admitted 11 to 15 year olds, but in 1945 the principal of RNC and [[Head teacher|head master]] of [[New College Worcester|Worcester College for the Blind]] came to an agreement that Worcester would provide secondary education and RNC would take students over the age of 16.<ref>{{cite book|title= An experiment in education: the history of Worcester College for the Blind, 1866<U+2013>1966|first= Donald|last= Bell|date= 1967|publisher= Hutchinson Publications}}</ref>

As well as being one of its founders, Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal from 1871 until his retirement in 1912.<ref name=History/> He was knighted as a [[Knight Bachelor]] by [[King Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1909,<ref name="Tennessee"/><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28275|date=30 July 1909|startpage=5805|accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> the honour being bestowed on him for his services to blind people.<ref name=Perkins/> He was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell, and following his death in 1929 Guy's widow, Louie Bealby Campbell took over the position.<ref name=History/> The role of principal passed outside the Campbell family for the first time upon Louie Bealby Campbell's retirement in 1934.<ref name=History/>

===Relocation===
[[File:Rowton Castle - geograph.org.uk - 51756.jpg|thumb|right|Rowton Castle, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, seen in 2005. RNC moved to Rowton during the Second World War and was based there until the late 1970s.|alt=A large brick building built in the style of a medieval castle; grass, bushes and some trees in the foreground.]]

The 20th century saw the college move location several times before establishing itself at its present campus in Hereford. The first of these moves occurred at the beginning of the Second World War, when the college was evacuated from its London site and moved to a mansion named [[Great Maytham Hall|Great Maytham]] in [[Rolvenden]] in west [[Kent]].<ref name="Newsquest">{{cite news|url= http://archive.thisisherefordshire.co.uk/2003/9/18/29476.html|title= Assisting the blind to reach their full potential|work= Hereford Times|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 18 September 2003|accessdate= 26 November 2008}}</ref> However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours notice and the help of the [[Royal London Society for the Blind|London Society for the Blind]], a temporary home was found for RNC in [[Dorton]], near [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Newsquest"/> At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.<ref name=History/>

The college did not return to London because the Upper Norwood site <U+2013> which was being used as a hospital following RNC's move to Kent <U+2013> was bombed in 1940 during [[the Blitz]],<ref name="RNC"/> then acquired by the authorities.<ref name=History/> The college had to close temporarily, until a permanent new home could be found, but in 1941 it purchased new premises at [[Rowton Castle]] near [[Shrewsbury]] and relocated there.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Rowton">{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/schooled-for-scandal-and-blind-ambition.shtml?|title= Schooled for scandal and blind ambition|first= Ian|last= Macrae|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= 4 December 2004|accessdate= 27 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rowtoncastle.com/history/full/index.aspx|title= Rowton Castle history|publisher= Rowton Castle|accessdate= 27 January 2010}}</ref> The castle was built in the 17th Century and is situated in 17 acres of grounds six miles west of Shrewsbury.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rowtoncastle.com/|title= Welcome to Rowton Castle Hotel & Restaurant|publisher= Rowton Castle|accessdate= 2 May 2010}}</ref> This accommodation had limited space, and throughout its time in Shrewsbury RNC acquired other premises in and around the town. Albrighton Hall, about three miles from Shrewsbury, was acquired in 1955 and adapted for residential and training purposes for male students, and Hardy House was obtained as a new residential area for female students in 1958.<ref name=History/> Plans to enlarge the Rowton site were seriously affected when, in 1953, fire destroyed much of the buildings and 38 pianos and organs.<ref name=History/> The alarm was raised by one of the students,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1950-1975/1953.html|title= Our Century|work= Express & Star|publisher= Midland News Association|date= 2 June 1953|accessdate= 16 January 2010}}</ref> and everybody present was evacuated to safety.<ref name=History/> Training was able to continue after Henshaw's Institution for the Blind took students and staff as a temporary measure.<ref name=History/>

RNC remained in [[Shropshire]] for many years until, in 1978, more suitable accommodation was found that would enable RNC to consolidate its teaching and residential accommodation into one campus, and the college moved to its current home in Hereford.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Newsquest"/> The site had previously been the campus of [[Hereford College of Education]], a former teacher training college.<ref name="History"/> 1978 also saw the college adopt its present name of The Royal National College for the Blind.<ref name="Visugate">{{cite book|title= New Beacon, January 1996|first= Ann|last= Lee|publisher= RNIB publications}}</ref> RNC received an official opening at its new campus by Prince Charles, who arrived in Hereford by helicopter to perform the ceremony in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|url=  http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/features/thislife/3847419.Many_happy_returns__Charles___remember_when_you_visited_us_/|title= Many happy returns, Charles <U+2013> remember when you visited us?|work= Worcester News|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 14 November 2008|accessdate= 15 February 2010}}</ref>

===Restructuring ===

The late 2000s saw RNC undergoing some significant restructuring as it responded to changes in the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students.<ref name="Changes"/> However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest.<ref name="In Touch"/> There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college.<ref name="UCU1"/><ref name="Changes"/> Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told ''In Touch'', the [[BBC Radio 4]] news programme for visually impaired listeners; "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us. And at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses but at the same time we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors."<ref name=Changes/> In an interview in January 2010, current principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/20100112-it.rtf|title= BBC Radio 4 In Touch|work= BBC Online|publisher= BBC|first= Peter|last= White|date= 12 January 2010|accessdate= 17 February 2010}}</ref>

The changes led to significant department reorganisations within RNC, with several staff members being summarily dismissed in the process.

Traditionally courses in Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also available at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of a decline in the number of students studying the subjects.
