'''New Mexico Military Institute''' ('''N.M.M.I.''') is a [[Public school (government funded)|state-supported educational institution]] located in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], United States. One of five [[military junior college]]s in the United States, it the only state-supported military college located in the western United States. NMMI was founded in 1891 by Captain Joseph Lea and Colonel Robert Goss. Its architecture and organization was inspired by the [[Virginia Military Institute]].{{citationneeded|date=September 2013}}

NMMI includes a college preparatory four-year [[high school]] and a two-year [[junior college]]. Students who attend NMMI are referred to as cadets. NMMI is the only state-supported co-educational college preparatory military boarding high school (grades 9<U+2013>12) and junior college in the United States Academic school years begin with between 900 and 980 cadets enrolled, 95 percent of whom go on to four-year universities. The school's 2-year Army [[ROTC]] [[Early Commissioning Program]] (ECP) commissions approximately 40 cadets each year as US Army [[Second Lieutenant#United States|2nd Lieutenants]], and about 100 cadets each year go to one of the five major [[United States Service academies]].<ref name="boardingschoolreview.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/455 |title=New Mexico Military Institute - Roswell, New Mexico/NM - Boarding School Profile |publisher=Boarding School Review |date=2008-02-14 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> Many NMMI graduates are currently serving as senior-level officers in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]].

The school's motto is ''"Duty, Honor, and Achievement"''. The school's athletic teams are the Broncos (junior college) and the Colts (high school). The school's colors are scarlet and black. The Cadet Honor Code, which was voted into place by a unanimous vote of the Corps of Cadets in 1921, states "A Cadet Will Not Lie, Cheat, or Steal, Nor Tolerate Those Who Do."

==History==

New Mexico Military Institute was founded by Colonel Robert S. Goss and Captain Joseph C. Lea in 1891, originally as the Goss Military Academy, with an initial enrollment of 26 students. In 1895 it acquired the land at its current location, and in 1910 it received land-grant status and revenue from the New Mexico government. Hundreds of Institute graduates served in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], including Medal of Honor recipient [[John C. Morgan]].<ref name="Knowledge book">{{cite book|title=New Cadet Required Knowledge and Skills Qualification Book|year=2013}}</ref> 

In 1948, the Institute introduced a four-year liberal arts college program, but discontinued it in 1956. The Institute became a fully coeducational university in 1977, although some females had attended as non-cadet day students from 1891 to 1898. The current superintendent, Major General (Retired) Jerry W. Grizzle, was appointed in 2010.

In 2013, the Institute broke off relations with the Alumni Association over disagreement about finances.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uyttebrouck|first=Olivier|title=Regents tell NMMI alumni group to fix finances|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/176022/news/regents-tell-nmmi-alumni-group-to-fix-finances.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|date=March 8, 2013|page=C2}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=NMMI severs ties with alumni association|url=http://kfda.dsys1.worldnow.com/story/22096361/nmmi-severs-ties-with-alumni-association|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=KFDA-TV|date=April 27, 2013}}</ref> Members of the Alumni Association claimed that this was an effort by the school to gain access and control of the over $5.2 million in assets of the association.<ref>{{cite news|last=Romo|first=Rene|title=NMMI breaks with alumni group|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/main/201683/news/nmmi-breaks-with-alumni-group.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|last=Vallez|first=Kim|title=Military Institute wants alumni association|url=http://www.krqe.com/news/local/southeast/military-institute-wants-alumni-association|accessdate=16 August 2013|newspaper=KRQE|date=6 August 2013}}</ref> On June 10, 2013, the Institute filed a lawsuit in [[Chaves County]], New Mexico, to take control of the assets of the Alumni Association.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Mexico Military Institute v.

==Campus==

The original area of land for the campus was donated to the school by local rancher James J. Hagerman, for whom the main barracks complex is named.<ref name="Knowledge book" /> The Institute's buildings are made in a uniform [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style out of buff brick. The campus is a designated area on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Cadet life==

Cadets are organized into a Corps of Cadets where 6th Class (9th grade high school equivalent) through 1st Class (college sophomore) cadets are all treated on the basis of earned merit. The military school structure is provided through all cadets living in the Troop Barracks, with all classes, meals, and military and physical training occurring "On Post" (on campus) in a controlled environment. Cadets start out as "RAT"s (recruits at training) and then graduate to become New Cadets, Yearlings, and finally Old Cadets. Cadets also earn military rank within the Corps. These factors determine a cadet's privileges and authority and define social interactions at the Institute. Fraternization between classes is forbidden. 

Cadets with too many demerits may be put on Disciplinary Probation, in which many of their privileges are taken away. Cadets who fail to meet standards of academic performance are put on Academic Probation, in which their privileges are largely revoked. Punishment at the Institute is strict and quickly administered by the cadre and staff of the Institute when regulations are not followed. Leaving post is generally only authorized on weekends.
