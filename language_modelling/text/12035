'''Peary''' is the closest large [[Moon|lunar]] [[impact crater]] to the [[lunar north pole]]. At this latitude the crater interior receives little sunlight, and parts of the southern floor remain permanently cloaked in shadow. From the [[Earth]] the crater appears on the northern lunar limb, and is seen from the side.

The crater is nearly circular, with an outward bulge along the northeast rim. There is a gap in the southwestern rim, where it joins a slightly smaller worn crater formation. The outer rim of Peary is worn and eroded, creating a rugged mountainous ring that produces long shadows across the crater floor.

The crater floor is relatively flat, but marked by several small craterlets, particularly in the eastern half. The southern third of the interior remains cloaked in shadows, and so its features cannot be readily discerned.

The worn and [[lava]]-flooded crater [[Byrd (lunar crater)|Byrd]] lies close to the southern rim of Peary. To the northwest, about a quarter the way around the lunar pole, is the larger crater [[Hermite (crater)|Hermite]]. On the opposite side of the pole, on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the Moon, lies the still-larger [[Rozhdestvenskiy (crater)|Rozhdestvenskiy]].

In 2004, a team led by Dr. [[Ben Bussey]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]] using images taken by the [[Clementine mission]] determined that four mountainous regions on the rim of Peary appeared to remain illuminated for the entire lunar day.<ref>{{cite news

No similar regions of eternal light exist at the less-mountainous [[south pole]]. Clementine's images were taken during the northern lunar hemisphere's summer season, and it remains unknown whether these four mountains are shaded at any point during their local winter season.

The northern rim of Peary is considered a likely site for a future [[Moon base]] due to this steady illumination, which would provide both a relatively stable temperature and an uninterrupted solar power supply. It is also near permanently shadowed areas that may contain some quantity of frozen [[water]].
