'''Ithkuil''' is a [[constructed language]] created by John Quijada, designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. The language is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory.

The language is presented as a cross between an [[a priori (languages)|a priori]] ''philosophical'' and a ''logical'' language.  It also strives to minimize the ambiguities and semantic vagueness found in natural human languages.<ref name="sl2120">[http://www.ithkuil.net/00_intro.html ''A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language'']</ref> 

The many examples from the original grammar book<ref name="sl2120"/> show that a message, like a meaningful phrase or a sentence, can usually be expressed in Ithkuil with fewer sounds, or lexically distinct speech-elements, than in natural human languages. J. Quijada deems his creation too complex and strictly regular a language to have developed <U+201C>naturally<U+201D>, but nonetheless a language suited to human conversation. No person, including Quijada, is hitherto known to be able to speak Ithkuil fluently.

In 2004<ref name="kozl"/> <U+2014> and again in 2009<ref name="gertelmann">[http://library.conlang.org/articles/ithkuil_Komputerra_17.pdf Ithkuil and its philosophical design] (Russian) by Mikhail Gertelman, Kompyuterra (17(781)2009 p 12)</ref> with its offshoot, [[#Ilaksh|Ilaksh]] <U+2014> Ithkuil was featured in the Russian-language popular science and IT-technology magazine ''[[Computerra]]''. In 2008, it won the Smiley Award.<ref>[http://dedalvs.com/smileys/2008.html The 2008 Smiley Award Winner: Ithkuil]</ref>

The second "definitive (or 'official')" revision of Ithkuil, also named ''I<U+0163>ku<U+00EE>l'', was released in July 15, 2011; this is a major revision of the previous version. Most of this article deals with the older version of Ithkuil released in 2004, but it is indicated which sections deal with which version of the language.

===Ithkuil (2004)===
====Influences====
For his influences, Quijada cites the <U+201C>morpho-phonology of [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] verb complexes, the moods of verbs of certain [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian languages]], the aspectual system of [[Niger<U+2013>Kordofanian languages]], the nominal case systems of [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Dagestanian languages]], the enclitic system of the [[Wakashan languages]], the positional orientation systems of [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]] and [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]], the [[Semitic root|Semitic triliteral root]] morphology, and the hearsay and possessive categories of [[Suzette Elgin]]'s [[L<U+00E1>adan]] language<U+201D>.<ref name="sl2120" >section ''A Brief History of the Language<U+2019>s Development''</ref>

Since the mention of Ithkuil in the Russian magazine ''Computerra'',<ref name="kozl"/> several speakers of Russian contacted Quijada and expressed enthusiasm to learn the language, with several complaining about its difficulty in pronunciation. Quijada remade the language<U+2019>s morphophonology and published the revision on 10 June 2007, as Ilaksh.<ref name="sl2120" /> The innovation featured other amendments to grammar, like some additional ''Levels'' or a slight shuffling of ''noun cases''.

The Ilaksh script was redesigned.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20110605210044/http://ithkuil.net/ilaksh/images/script_diagram.gif Ilaksh script diagram (indicates what the various parts of an Ilaksh logogram indicate) (no longer available on site, link shows archive.org's cache)]</ref><ref>[http://ithkuil.net/11_script.htm#Sec11o6 Ilaksh formal / ornamental script example, an updated version of the older script diagram]</ref> It has two forms, a sequential <U+201C>informal<U+201D> system suitable for handwriting or compact typesetting, and a <U+201C>formal<U+201D> [[logographic]] system with artistic possibilities resembling [[Maya script]]s.

In the <U+201C>informal<U+201D> writing system, several parallel sets of lines are shaped to correspond sequentially to the different parallel sets of lexemes and inflections. It is directly pronounceable. The author designed it with reserve for convenient handwriting. The overall design would permit compact, clear, black-and-white rendering.

In the colorful <U+201C>formal<U+201D> script, a single complex glyph represents an entire sentence. Diversely shaped, shaded and superimposed <U+201C>cartouches<U+201D> represent the [[syntax|syntactic]] relations of the verb and noun phrases of a sentence. The edges of the cartouches have particular shapes describing one set of inflections, while the colors describe another set of inflexions, and the textures yet another set. On the cartouches, <U+201C>letters<U+201D> of [[hexagon]]al outline spell out the shapes of particular lexemes. The cartouches form phrases, with primary phrases overlapping subordinate phrases. The coloring system utilizes different color densities and texturing for different colors in order to be usable by color-blind people. These density conventions also allow the formal system to be inexpensively printed in black-and-white, or inscribed or imprinted on stone or other materials.<ref>[http://www.ithkuil.net/11_script.htm Ilaksh Chapter 11: The Writing System]</ref>

As of July 2011, Quijada plans to adopt the formal script "for use as an alternative, 'ornamental' writing system for artistic purposes" to the 2011 revision of Ithkuil, which was made to be morphologically similar to Ilaksh.

==Grammar==
===Ithkuil (2004)===
The [[lexicon]] of Ithkuil potentially consists of 3,600 [[Root (linguistics)|word roots]]; so far, just 900 are assigned with individual translations. Each root consists of 1<U+2013>5 [[consonant]]s, and can [[Derivation (linguistics)|derive]] thousands of [[lexeme]]s through the use of Ithkuil<U+2019>s complex rules of [[morphophonology]], which involve both [[consonant mutation|consonantal]] and vocal mutation, shifts in syllabic stress and tone, and affixation.<!--

Ithkuil words can be divided into just two [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], ''formatives'' and ''adjuncts''. Formatives can function both as nouns and as verbs, depending on the morpho-semantic context.<ref name=Sec2o4>[http://ithkuil.net/02_morpho-phonology.html#Sec2o4 A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Section 2.4 - Parts of Speech]</ref> Both nominal and verbal formatives are inflected to one of the possible 3 ''stems'', 3 ''patterns'', 2 ''designations'' (''formal'' or ''informal''), 9 ''configurations'', 4 ''affiliations'', 4 ''perspectives'', 6 ''extensions'', 4 ''contexts'', 2 ''essences'', and 96 [[Grammatical case|''cases'']]; formatives also can take on some of the 153 [[affix]]es, which are further qualified into one of 9 ''degrees''. Verbal formatives are additionally inflected for 7 ''illocutions'' and 7 ''conflations''. 

''Verbal adjuncts'' work in conjunction with adjacent formatives to provide additional grammatical information.<ref name=Sec2o6o2>[http://ithkuil.net/02_morpho-phonology.html#Sec2o4o2 A Philosophical Design for a Hypothetical Language - Section 2.4.2 - Parts of Speech - Adjuncts]</ref> Verbal adjuncts are inflected to indicate 14 [[Valency (linguistics)|''valencies'']], 6 ''versions'', 8 ''formats'', 37 ''derivations'', 30 [[Linguistic modality|''modalities'']], 4 [[Comparative|''levels'']], 14 [[Evidentiality|''validations'']], 9 ''phases'', 9 ''sanctions'', 32 [[Grammatical aspect|''aspects'']], 8 [[Grammatical mood|''moods'']], and 24 ''biases''.

====An example of morphological analysis====
:''(based entirely on the original Ithkuil grammar book<ref name="sl2120"/>)''<!-- So before accusing me of original research or unverified claims, go learn Ithkuil. ~~~~ -->

The word ''{{Unicode|i<U+0163>ku<U+00EE>l}}'' is a ''formative'' which was derived in original Ithkuil from the ''root'' ''k-l'' (broadly concerning <U+201C>speech<U+201D>, <U+201C>voice<U+201D>, or even <U+201C>interpretation<U+201D>) through the addition of several morphological determinants:
* The '''-u-''' vocalic infix
*:''kul'' was the ''holistic'' variety of the ''Stem 2'' of the three other possible stems from ''k-l''. Translating roughly as <U+201C>a meaningful unit of speech<U+201D>, i. e. <U+201C>a word<U+201D>, it gives no emphasis on the meaning or the vocal rendering of the word.
* The '''u <U+2192> u<U+00EE>''' mutation of the infix
*:''Secondary'', as opposed to ''Primary'', ''Mode'', means that the word ''ku<U+00EE>l'' refers not to a real-life phenomenon, but rather to a mental representation, or projection, of that phenomenon; to an imaginary or hypothetical object. Thus <U+201C>a made-up word<U+201D>.
* A ''Grade 8'' mutation of the first radical consonant: '''k <U+2192> <U+0163>k'''
*:The ''Configuration'' of the term is '''Composite'''. Roughly corresponding to the [[plural]]ity concept in [[Indo-European languages]], it also implies the objects in question (words, ''ku<U+00EE>l'') to be diverse, while forming a <U+201C>coherent emergent entity<U+201D> (rather than just a collection or an array of different words), thus meaning <U+201C>a [[vocabulary]]/[[lexicon]]<U+201D>.
* The '''i-''' vocalic prefix, one of the 24 possible for formative roots
*:The ''Extension'' is ''Delimitive'', perceiving <U+201C>the vocabulary<U+201D> as entire, with clearly distinguished boundaries, as opposed to it being just a local manifestation{{spaced ndash}}such as slang or a dialect{{spaced ndash}}of a broader lexicon (''-<U+0163>ku<U+00EE>l'').
*:The ''Affiliation'' of the set of objects in question is ''Coalescent''. This indicates that the individual members of the set act together toward a higher purpose by coordinating their complementary functions. Thus, <U+201C>a [[vocabulary]]/[[lexicon]]<U+201D> becomes <U+201C>a language<U+201D>.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Syllabic stress]] on the penultimate syllable (''-u-'')
*:The ''Perspective'' of the noun is ''Monadic'', seeing <U+201C>the language<U+201D> as a single and specific entity, rather than a collection of many languages existing separately, the general phenomenon (<U+201C>human languages<U+201D>) or the abstract idea of language.

Thus, the approximate translation of ''{{Unicode|i<U+0163>ku<U+00EE>l}}'' is <U+201C>an idea/fantasy of a complete purposeful system of complementary speech elements<U+201D>, or simply <U+201C>an imaginary language<U+201D>.

====Numeral system====
Ithkuil uses a numeral system of [[Radix|base 100]]. There are roots for the numbers 1 to 10 (l-s, k-s, <U+0161>-s, p-s, <U+0163>-s, t-s, n-s, x-s, f-s, and m-s), and the stem-specific derivative affix is used with a root to add a multiple of 10, providing the numerals up to 99. Ithkuil doesn<U+2019>t use the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]]. Numbers greater than 100 are expressed periphrastically in speech, while I<U+00E7>ta<U+00EE>l has logograms for the numbers 1 to 100 and for even powers of 100.

===Ithkuil (2011)===
The [[lexicon]] of Ithkuil potentially consists of approximately 3,600 [[Root (linguistics)|word roots]].<ref name=2o2>[http://www.ithkuil.net/02_morpho-phonology.html#Sec2o2 Chapter 2: Morpho-Phonology, 2.2 Root and stem formation]</ref> So far, just over 900 are assigned with individual translations.<ref name=lexicon>[http://www.ithkuil.net/lexicon.htm The Lexicon]</ref> Each root consists of a cluster of 1<U+2013>4 [[consonant]]s (five-consonant clusters are also available, but remain without an assigned meaning).<ref name=2o2/> From the root, word stems are formed by affixing the vocalic affix that indicates pattern, stem type, and function.<ref name=2o2/>

==Orthography==
Ithkuil's native script is called I<U+00E7>ta<U+00EE>l, the (2004) Ithkuil word for 'hypothetical writing system'. It is a ''morphophonemic'' script as characters convey both phonetic and morphological information. Its use is closely tied to Ithkuil<U+2019>s grammatical system, which allows much of the phonological aspect of words to be morpho-syntactically inferred. Those parts of an Ithkuil word whose pronunciation is predictable are not written, while the characters used to indicate the pronunciation of the unpredictable parts of a word also convey the grammatical information necessary to reconstruct the implicit phonetics. Words are thus written in a highly abbreviated manner, particularly useful for the highly inflected, occasionally elongated words of the Ithkuil language. The script is also used alphabetically for transliterating foreign words.

==Possible advantages==
The [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir<U+2013>Whorf hypothesis]] postulates that a person<U+2019>s language influences their perceptions and cognitive patterns. Stanislav Kozlovsky proposed,<ref name="kozl">(Russian) [http://www.computerra.ru/offline/2004/550/34762/ <U+00AB><U+0421><U+043A><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+044C> <U+043C><U+044B><U+0441><U+043B><U+0438><U+00BB>, <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0437><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439>]<U+2013> ''Speed of thought'' by Stanislav Kozlovsky, ''Computerra'', &#8470;26-27, June 20, 2004</ref> in the Russian popular-scientific magazine ''Computerra'', that a fluent speaker of Ithkuil, accordingly, would think <U+201C>about five or six times as fast<U+201D> as a speaker of a typical natural language. One may also argue that, Ithkuil being an extremely precise and [[synthetic language]], its speaker would, under the Sapir<U+2013>Whorf hypothesis, have a more discerning, deeper understanding both of everyday situations and of broader phenomena, and of abstract [[philosophy|philosophical]] categories. 

However, the creator of the language has stated he does not believe a speaker would think necessarily any faster, because even though the language is terse, a single word requires a lot more thought before it can be spoken than it would in a natural language.<ref name="FAQ">[http://www.ithkuil.net/faqs.html FAQ]</ref>
<blockquote>"For these reasons, I believe use of Ithkuil would probably allow one to think more deeply, critically, and analytically; but think faster? I doubt it."</blockquote>

Kozlovsky also likened Ithkuil to the fictional ''[[Speedtalk]]'' from [[Robert A. Heinlein]]<U+2019>s novella ''[[Gulf (Heinlein)|Gulf]]'', and contrasted both languages with the ''[[Newspeak]]'' of the communicationally restricted society of [[George Orwell|Orwell]]<U+2019>s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Ithkuil is by far the most complete language of the three.<ref>Speedtalk and Newspeak were merely <U+201C>sampled<U+201D> by their creators, with an outline of neither grammar nor lexicon.</ref> John Quijada acknowledged the similarity of Ithkuil<U+2019>s design goals to those of Speedtalk,<ref name="sl2120"/> remarking that,

<blockquote><U+201C>[h]owever, Heinlein<U+2019>s Speedtalk appears to focus only on the morpho-phonological component of language[, whereas] Ithkuil has been designed with an equal focus on [morphology, lexico-morphology, or lexico-semantics]. Additionally, the apparent purpose of Heinlein's language is simple rapidity/brevity of speech and thought, while Ithkuil is focused on maximal communication in the most efficient manner, a somewhat different purpose, in which brevity per se is irrelevant.<U+201D></blockquote>
