'''Charles-Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns''' ({{IPA-fr|<U+0283>a<U+0281>l kamij s<U+025B><U+0303>s<U+0251><U+0303>s|lang}}; 9 October 1835{{spaced ndash}}16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. His best-known works include [[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]] (1863), the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Second Piano Concerto]] (1868), the [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|First Cello Concerto]] (1872), ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Danse macabre]]'' (1874), the opera ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1877), the [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Third Violin Concerto]] (1880), the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Third ("Organ") Symphony]] (1886) and ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' (1887).

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was a musical prodigy from an early age, making his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the [[Paris Conservatoire]] he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at [[Saint-Merri]], Paris and, from 1858, [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], the official church of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]]. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in France, mainland Europe, Britain, and the Americas.

As a young man, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the [[Impressionism in music|impressionist]] and [[dodecaphonic]] schools of music; although there were [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] elements in his music, foreshadowing works by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and [[Les Six]], he was often regarded as a reactionary in the years before and after his death.

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns held only one teaching post, at the <U+00C9>cole de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and he remained in it for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included [[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>]], among whose own later pupils was [[Maurice Ravel]]. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, whom they revered as a genius.

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns (1798<U+2013>1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and his wife, Fran<U+00E7>oise-Cl<U+00E9>mence, {{n<U+00E9>e}} Collin.<ref name=grove/> Victor Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was of [[Normandy|Norman]] ancestry, and his wife was from a [[Haute-Marne]] family;{{#tag:ref| During the [[Dreyfus affair]] when anti-Semitism was rife among opponents of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], it was rumoured that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, who had contributed money for Dreyfus's defence, was really surnamed "Kahn".<ref name=duchen/><ref>Prod'homme, p. 470</ref> In fact Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had no Jewish ancestry, which did not stop the [[Nazi]]s from banning his music during their regime in Germany.<ref>Kater, p. 85</ref>|group= n}} their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], always considered himself a true Parisian.<ref>Rees, p. 22</ref> Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns died of [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]] on the first anniversary of his marriage.<ref>Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, p. 3</ref> The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]], {{convert|29|km|mi}} to the south of Paris.<ref>Studd, p. 6; and Rees, p. 25</ref>

[[File:Saint-Saens-1846.jpg|thumb|left|alt=sketch of young boy at piano keyboard|upright|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns as a boy]]
When Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed [[perfect pitch]] and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano.<ref name=schon>Schonberg, p. 42</ref> His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of [[Camille-Marie Stamaty]], a former pupil of [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]].<ref>Gallois, p. 19</ref> Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns later wrote, was good training.<ref>Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> Cl<U+00E9>mence Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic [[Harold C.

"It All Came Too Easily For Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 January 1969, p. D17</ref> The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the [[Salle Pleyel]], in a programme that included [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 15 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto in B{{music|flat}}]] ([[K<U+00F6>chel-Verzeichnis|K]]450), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]].<ref name=grove>Ratner, Sabina Teller.

From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], which was then little known in France.<ref>Rees, p. 40</ref>

As a schoolboy Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was outstanding in many subjects. In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics. His enthusiasms included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life.<ref name=grove/>{{#tag:ref|In a 2012 symposium on Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, L<U+00E9>o Houziaux contributed a study of the composer's contributions to astronomy, including three papers he wrote between 1889 and 1913 for French journals.<ref>Houziaux, pp. 12<U+2013>25</ref> Houziaux concludes that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's contributions helped to popularise the science of astronomy in France.<ref>Houziaux, p. 17</ref>|group= n}}

[[File:Old Conservatoire de Paris building, early19th century.jpg|thumb|alt=Exterior of 19th-century French city building|The old Paris Conservatoire building, where Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns studied]]
In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was admitted to the [[Paris Conservatoire]], France's most important music academy.

===Early career===
[[File:Saint Merri Church Interior 2, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|alt=interior of Gothic church|thumb|The church of [[Saint-Merri]], Paris, where Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was organist, 1853<U+2013>57]]
On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of [[Saint-Merri]] near the [[H<U+00F4>tel de Ville, Paris|H<U+00F4>tel de Ville]]. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns a comfortable income.<ref>Smith, p. 10</ref> The organ, the work of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Henri Clicquot]], had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered.<ref>Rees, p. 65</ref> With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1853).<ref name=fallon/> This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of [[Napoleon III]] and the restoration of the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]].<ref>Rees, p. 67</ref> The work brought the composer another first prize from the Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Sainte-C<U+00E9>cile.<ref>Studd, p. 30</ref>

Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's talent were the composers [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Franz Liszt]], and the influential singer [[Pauline Viardot]], who all encouraged him in his career.<ref name=grove/> In early 1858 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.<ref>Rees, p. 87; and Harding, p. 62</ref>

Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Richard Wagner]].<ref name=grove/> Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions.<ref>Nectoux, p. 39; and Parker, p. 574</ref><ref name=klein/> He commented, "I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character. They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me. But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion."<ref name=klein>Klein, p. 91</ref>

===1860s: Teacher and growing fame===
[[File:Gabriel Faur<U+00E9> en uniforme de l'Ecole Niedermeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=young man in 19th-century college uniform|[[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>]], pupil, prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> and lifelong friend of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, as a student]]
In 1861 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the <U+00C9>cole de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which [[Louis Niedermeyer]] had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner.<ref>Jones (1989), p. 16</ref> His best-known pupil, [[Gabriel Faur<U+00E9>]], recalled in old age:
{{quote|After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known.&nbsp;... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment&nbsp;... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life."<ref>Faur<U+00E9> in 1922, ''quoted'' in Nectoux, pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref>|}}
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including [[Andr<U+00E9> Messager]]).<ref>Ratner (1999), p. 120</ref> He conceived his best-known piece, ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.<ref>Ratner (1999), p. 136</ref>

In 1864 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:
{{quote|We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, who had the strange notion of competing. I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity. But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can<U+2019>t be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less. So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns. But, whatever else, one must be honest.<ref>Berlioz, p. 430</ref>|}}
According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known ''bon mot'' about Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, "He knows everything, but lacks inexperience"<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO "LACKS EXPERIENCE": IT IS CORRECT AS IT IS (IT IS BERLIOZ'S LITTLE JOKE) --> ("Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexp<U+00E9>rience").<ref>Gallois, p. 96</ref>{{#tag:ref|Other writers recount and date the saying differently. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns recalled in old age that the comment was made about him when he was eighteen, by Gounod rather than Berlioz.<ref>Bellaigue, p. 59; and Rees, p. 395</ref> [[Jules Massenet]], according to his own memoirs, was the subject of the joke in 1863, when Auber said to Berlioz, "He'll go far, the young rascal, when he's had less experience."<ref>Massenet, pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref>|group= n}} The winner, Victor Sieg, had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may "have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had reached his summit of proficiency".<ref>Rees, p. 122</ref> The suggestion that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation. He himself wrote, "Art is intended to create beauty and character. Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it. In fact, it is very much better off when it does."<ref>Harding, p. 61: and Studd, p. 201</ref> The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was "a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul".<ref name=duchen>Duchen, Jessica.

===1870s: War, marriage and operatic success===
In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music.<ref name=r133/> Before they could take the proposal further, the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out.

As an admirer of Liszt's innovative [[symphonic poem]]s, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first "po<U+00E8>me symphonique" was ''[[Le Rouet d'Omphale]]'' (1871), premiered at a concert of the Soci<U+00E9>te Nationale in January 1872.<ref>Simeone, p. 122</ref> In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns finally had one of his operas staged.

Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor<U+00E9>]] with his mother.

In December 1877, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had a more solid operatic success, with ''[[Samson et Dalila]]'', his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at [[Weimar]] in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the [[Paris Op<U+00E9>ra]] until 1892.<ref name=crichton/>

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was a keen traveller. From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries. His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt.<ref>Leteur<U+00E9>, p. 135</ref>

===1880s: International figure===
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was elected to the [[Institut de France]] in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878.<ref>Smith, p. 119</ref> In July of that year he and his wife went to the [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergnat]] spa town of [[La Bourboule]] for a holiday. On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near [[Bordeaux]] at the age of ninety-five.<ref>Smith, pp. 120<U+2013>121</ref> Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was more attracted to his own sex than to women.<ref>Rees, pp. 198<U+2013>201</ref>{{#tag:ref|In a 2012 study of the composer's private life, Mitchell Morris mentions but classes as apocryphal a story attributing to Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns the remark, "Je ne suis pas homosexuel.

Take me as I am."<ref>Studd, p. 253</ref>|group= n}} After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns increasingly found a surrogate family in Faur<U+00E9> and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle.<ref>Duchen, p. 69</ref> Marie told him, "For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here."<ref>Nectoux and Jones (1989), p. 68</ref>

In the 1880s Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera.<ref name=go>Macdonald, Hugh.

Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, normally a fluent, even facile composer,{{#tag:ref|Studying [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] manuscripts in London, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was disconcerted to find a composer who worked even more quickly than he did.<ref>Rees, p. 242</ref>|group= n}} worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England.<ref name=go/> The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime.<ref name=crichton/> When it was produced at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in 1898, ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' commented that though French librettists generally "make a pretty hash of British history", this piece was "not altogether contemptible as an opera story".<ref>"Royal Opera, Covent-Garden", ''The Era'', 16 July 1898, p. 11</ref>

The open-mindedness of the Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by [[Vincent d'Indy]]. They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its ''"Ars Gallica"'' ethos of commitment to French works. Bussine and Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886.<ref name=strasser/>{{#tag:ref| In 1909 d'Indy's inflexibility led a new generation of composers, led by Faur<U+00E9>'s pupils Ravel and [[Charles Koechlin]], to break away and found a new group, Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Musicale Ind<U+00E9>pendant, whose ideals were closer to the original vision of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns and his colleagues in 1870.<ref>Jones (1989), p.133</ref>|group=n}} Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers. His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music.<ref name=strasser/>

By the 1880s Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer.<ref>Harding, p. 116</ref> In 1886 the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]] of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Third ("Organ") Symphony]]. It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], conducted by [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]].<ref>"Philharmonic Society", ''The Times'', 22 May 1886, p. 5; and "Music <U+2013> Philharmonic Society", ''The Daily News'', 27 May 1886, p. 6</ref> The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year.<ref>Deruchie, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> Later in 1887 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's "drame lyrique" ''Proserpine'' opened at the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique. It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost.<ref name=go/>

In December 1888 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's mother died.<ref>Leteur<U+00E9>, p. 134</ref> He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide.<ref>Studd, pp. 172<U+2013>173</ref> He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose.<ref>Rees, p. 286</ref>

===1890s: Marking time===
During the 1890s Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before. A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893.<ref>Jones (1989), p. 69</ref> He wrote one opera, the comedy ''Phryn<U+00E9>'' (1893), and together with [[Paul Dukas]] helped to complete ''Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>gonde'' (1895) an opera left unfinished by [[Ernest Guiraud]], who died in 1892. ''Phryn<U+00E9>'' was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring [[grand opera]].<ref>"New Opera by Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns", ''The Times'', 25 May 1893, p. 5</ref> His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]] ''Africa'' (1891) and his [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Fifth ("Egyptian") Piano Concerto]], which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his d<U+00E9>but at the Salle Pleyel in 1846.<ref>Studd, pp. 203<U+2013>204</ref> Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support.<ref>"M. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns", ''The Times'', 5 June 1896, p. 4</ref>

Among the concerts that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns undertook during the decade was one at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in June 1893, when he, [[Max Bruch|Bruch]] and [[Peter Ilyitch Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] performed at an event presented by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] for the [[Cambridge University Musical Society]], marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors.<ref>"Cambridge University Musical Society", ''The Times'', 13 June 1893, p. 10</ref> Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: "The demands of English religion are not excessive. The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers".<ref>Harding, p. 185</ref> His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio ''The Promised Land'', was composed for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] of 1913.<ref>"Gloucester Music Festival", ''The Times'', 12 September 1913, p. 4</ref>

===1900<U+2013>21: Last years===
In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor<U+00E9>. This remained his home for the rest of his life.<ref name=p484>Prod'homme, p. 484</ref> He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist. He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France.<ref name=p484/> In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the US, as a pianist and conductor.<ref>Rees, pp. 370<U+2013>371 and 381</ref> In New York on his second visit he premiered his "Praise ye the Lord" for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion.<ref name="Rees, p. 381">Rees, p. 381</ref>

Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Eighth Symphony]] in 1910.<ref>Gallois, p. 350</ref> Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music. Though he strove to conceal it from Faur<U+00E9>, he did not understand or like the latter's opera ''[[P<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>lope]]'' (1913), of which he was the dedicatee.<ref>Nectoux, p. 238</ref> In 1917 [[Francis Poulenc]], at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns as a genius.<ref>Nichols. p. 117</ref> By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns had little in common. His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy. Nor did the theories of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Sch<U+00F6>nberg]]'s [[dodecaphony]] commend themselves to Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns:
{{quote|There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint. "Everyone ought to make his own rules. Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression. There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords. All aggregations of notes are legitimate." That is called, and they believe it, the ''development of taste''.<ref>Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, p. 95</ref>|}}
Holding such conservative views, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was out of sympathy <U+2013> and out of fashion <U+2013> with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty.<ref>Morrison, p. 64</ref> It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' in 1913.<ref>Glass, Philip.

p. 47</ref>

When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Faur<U+00E9> and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher. They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism,<ref>Jones (1989), pp. 162<U+2013>165</ref> and also his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's ''En blanc et noir'' (1915): "We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the [[cubist]] pictures."<ref>Nectoux , p. 108</ref> His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's response to the neoclassicism of [[Les Six]] was equally uncompromising: of [[Darius Milhaud]]'s [[polytonal]] symphonic suite ''Prot<U+00E9>e'' (1919) he commented, "fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France".<ref name=ox/>

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities.<ref name=p484/> These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships.<ref>Rees, p. 430</ref>

In November 1921 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six.<ref>Prod'homme, p. 469</ref> He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do. While there he died without warning of a heart attack. His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re de Montparnasse]].<ref name=studd288>Studd, p. 288</ref> Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic <U+00E9>lite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881.<ref name=studd288/>

==Music==
{{see also|List of compositions by Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns}}
In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman. His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves&nbsp;... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing.<ref>Fuller Maitland, p. 208</ref>|}}
Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past. In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D{{space}}C{{space}}Parker wrote, "That Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns knows [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]]{{space}}... [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Josef Haydn|Haydn]] and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings. His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art."<ref>Parker, p. 563</ref>

Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns often favoured self-contained melodies. Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, "supple and pliable", more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the "phrase pattern AABB is characteristic".<ref name=g2/> An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him. ''Grove'' observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring. In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar. Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although ''Grove'' points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works.<ref name=g2/>

===Orchestral works===
The authors of the 1955 ''[[The Record Guide]]'', [[Edward Sackville-West, 5th Baron Sackville|Edward Sackville-West]] and [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor (music critic)|Desmond Shawe-Taylor]] write that Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's brilliant musicianship was "instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that that there are other forms of music besides opera."<ref name=rg>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, p. 641</ref> In the 2001 edition of ''Grove's Dictionary'', Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c. 1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The "Urbs Roma" Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and "thick and heavy" in its effect.<ref name=g2 /> Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of [[fugue|fugal]] writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885).<ref name=g2/> The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring ''motif'' treated in a Lisztian style of [[thematic transformation]].<ref name=rg/>

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the "vulgar blatancy" to which the earlier composer was prone.<ref name=rg2>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 642<U+2013>643</ref> The most popular of the four is ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Danse macabre]]'' (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation,<ref name=g2/> but in this piece he featured the [[xylophone]] prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers.<ref>Rees, p. 182</ref> ''[[Le Rouet d'Omphale]]'' (1870) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies.<ref name=r177>Rees, p. 177</ref> Rees rates ''Pha<U+00EB>ton'' (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody,{{#tag:ref|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote in his book ''Musical Memories'', "He who does not get absolute pleasure from a simple series of well-constructed chords, beautiful only in their arrangement, is not really fond of music."<ref>Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, p. 109</ref>|group= n}} and inspired in its depiction of the [[Phaethon|mythical hero]] and his fate.<ref name=r177/> A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece "the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre" rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece.<ref>Jones (2006), p. 78</ref> The last of the four symphonic poems, ''La jeunesse d'Hercule'' ("Hercules's Youth", 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful.<ref>Harding, p. 123</ref> In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration "set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel".<ref name=ox/>

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote a one-act ballet, ''Javot'' (1896), the score for the film ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'assassinat du duc de Guise]]'' (1908),{{#tag:ref|This music is sometimes cited as the first score composed for a film, but there were earlier examples including one by [[Herman Finck]] (1904).<ref>Wierzbicki, p. 41</ref>|group= n}} and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916. Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by [[Moli<U+00E8>re]] and Racine, for which Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier|Charpentier]].<ref name=fallon/><ref>Rees, p. 299</ref>

===Concertante works===
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos. His [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|First]], in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Second]], in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works. The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary [[sonata form]] first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn [[cadenza]]. The [[scherzo]] second movement and ''[[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|presto]]'' finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist [[Zygmunt Stojowski]] commented that the work "begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach".<ref>Herter, p. 75</ref> The [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Third Piano Concerto]], in E{{music|flat}} (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines.<ref name=schonberg/> The [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Fourth]], in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second. It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos. According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns "the Beethoven of France" (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony).<ref>Anderson (1989), p. 3; and Deruchie, p. 19</ref> The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor. The work is known as the "Egyptian" concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in [[Luxor]], and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing.<ref>Rees, p. 326</ref>

The [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|First Cello Concerto]], in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section. It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by [[Pablo Casals]] and later players.<ref>Ratner (2002), p. 364</ref> The [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Second]], in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections. It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Sa<U+00EB>ns-Sa<U+00EB>ns commented to Faur<U+00E9> that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult. There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's [[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Second]], in C major.<ref>Ratner (2002), p. 340</ref> The First, in A, was also completed in 1858. It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour.<ref>Ratner (2002), p. 343</ref> The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime.<ref>Ratner (2002), p. 339</ref> The [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Third]], in B minor, written for [[Pablo Sarasate]], is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity.<ref>Anderson (2009), pp. 2<U+2013>3</ref> It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the [[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]], in A minor, Op. 28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863. It changes from a wistful opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, "After a multi-stopped cadenza&nbsp;... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major".<ref>Larner, pp. 3<U+2013>4</ref>

===Operas===
[[File:Samson-et-dalila-1892.jpg|thumb|alt=Press illustration of opera production, showing singer playing Samson demolishing the enemy temple|''[[Samson et Dalila]]'' at the [[Paris Op<U+00E9>ra]], 1892: Samson ([[Edmond Vergnet]]) destroys the Philistine temple]]
Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished ''Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>gonde'', Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote twelve operas, two of which are ''[[Op<U+00E9>ra comique|op<U+00E9>ras comiques]]''. During the composer's lifetime his ''[[Henry VIII (opera)|Henry VIII]]'' became a repertory piece; since his death only ''Samson et Dalila'' has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, ''[[Ascanio]]'' (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work.<ref name=schonberg/><ref name=crichton/> The critic [[Ronald Crichton]] writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns "lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior."<ref name=crichton/> In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: "Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics".<ref>Huebner, p. 226</ref> Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's biographer [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of ''La princesse jaune'', which Harding describes as like Sullivan "with a light French touch".<ref name=h119>Harding, p. 119</ref>{{#tag:ref|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was friendly with Sullivan, and liked his music, making a point of seeing the latest [[Savoy opera]] when in London.<ref name=h119/>|group= n}}

Although most of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as "a bridge between [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] and the serious French operas of the early 1890s".<ref name=crichton353>Crichton, p. 353</ref> In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music <U+2013> "lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content{{space}}... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable."<ref name=crichton/> Stylistically, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns drew on a range of models.

From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns composed ''[[m<U+00E9>lodie]]s'', writing more than 140.<ref>Fauser, p. 210</ref> He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] or other German composers of ''[[Lieder]]''.<ref>Fauser, p. 217</ref> Unlike his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> Faur<U+00E9>, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career <U+2013> ''M<U+00E9>lodies persanes'' ("Persian Songs", 1870) and ''Le Cendre rouge'' ("The Red Ash Tree", 1914, dedicated to Faur<U+00E9>). The poet whose works he set most often was [[Victor Hugo]]; others included [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Pierre Corneille]], Amable Tastu, and, in eight songs, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet. He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer [[Lili Boulanger]] that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: "you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable."<ref>Fauser, p. 211</ref> Most of the ''m<U+00E9>lodies'' are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including "Le lever du soleil sur le Nil" ("Sunrise over the Nile", 1898) and "Hymne <U+00E0> la paix" ("Hymn to Peace", 1919), are for voice and orchestra.<ref name=fallon/> His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]].<ref>Fauser, p. 228</ref>

Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from [[motet]]s to masses and oratorios. Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios ''Le d<U+00E9>luge'' (1875) and ''The Promised Land'' (1913) with an English text by [[Hermann Klein]].<ref name=fallon/> He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, "One likes to be appreciated in the home, ''par excellence'', of oratorio."<ref name=klein/> He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra.<ref name=fallon/> In his choral works, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and other earlier masters of the genre. In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it.<ref name=klein/>

===Solo keyboard===
Nichols comments that although as a famous pianist Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote for the piano throughout his life, "this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark".<ref name=ox/> Nichols excepts the ''<U+00C9>tude en forme de valse'' (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique.<ref name=ox>Nichols, Roger.

In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as "Souvenir d'Italie" (1887), "Les cloches du soir" ("Evening bells", 1889) and "Souvenir d'Isma<U+00EF>lia" (1895).<ref name=fallon/><ref>Brown, Maurice J E, and Kenneth L Hamilton.

Unlike his pupil, Faur<U+00E9>, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo.<ref>Nectoux, pp. 525<U+2013>558</ref> Some of them were written for use in church services <U+2013> "Offertoire" (1853), "B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>diction nuptiale" (1859), "Communion" (1859) and others. After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former.<ref name=fallon />

===Chamber===
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other ''cantabile''.<ref name=r2005 /> The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was preparing new editions of the works of [[baroque]] composers including [[Jean-Philippe Rameau|Rameau]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]].<ref name=g2 />

{{Quote box |bgcolor=#CEF6EC|salign=right| quote = Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's chamber works reveal the complete man: his sense of tradition coupled with imagination, his feeling for colour, his sense of humour, his desire for balance and symmetry, his love of clarity. |source= Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005<ref name=r2005>Ratner (2005), p. 6</ref>|align=left| width=30%}}In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment.<ref name=r2005/> The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by ''Grove's Dictionary'' as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions. The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards.<ref name=g2/> The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier. It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment. Faur<U+00E9> called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance.<ref>Rees, p. 167</ref> The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo.<ref name="Rees, p. 381"/>

The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works. Ratner writes of them, "The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement."<ref name=r2005 /> Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of [[tarantella]]. For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it "a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism" amounting to "a summary of the rest".<ref>Gallois, p. 368</ref> The work contrasts a "doleful [[threnody]]" in the slow movement with the finale, which "pirouettes in 4/4 time", in a style reminiscent of the 18th century. The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata "a model of transparency, vitality and lightness", containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation.<ref>Gallois, pp. 368<U+2013>369</ref>

The composer's most famous work, ''The Carnival of the Animals'' (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by ''Grove's Dictionary'' to be part of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's chamber output. ''Grove'' rates it as "his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own ''Danse macabre'' and several popular tunes".<ref name=g2/> He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer.<ref name=duchen/>

===Recordings===
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was a pioneer in recorded music. In June 1904 [[The Gramophone Company]] of London sent its producer [[Fred Gaisberg]] to Paris to record Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns as accompanist to the [[mezzo-soprano]] Meyriane H<U+00E9>glon in arias from ''Ascanio'' and ''Samson et Dalila'', and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra).<ref name=marston>[http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_ward.htm Introduction] and [http://www.marstonrecords.com/legendary-piano/legendary_piano_tracks.htm Track Listing], "Legendary piano recordings: the complete Grieg, Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, Pugno, and Di<U+00E9>mer and other G & T rarities", Ward Marston, retrieved 24 February 2014</ref> Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns made more recordings for the company in 1919.<ref name=marston />

In the early days of the [[LP record]], Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's works were patchily represented on disc. ''The Record Guide'' (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of ''Danse Macabre'', ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works.<ref>Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor, pp. 642<U+2013>644</ref> In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD. The 2008 ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music|Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'' contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets. Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs.<ref>March, pp. 1122<U+2013>1131</ref> A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's ''m<U+00E9>lodies'' was released in 1997.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/songs/oclc/37703970&referer=brief_results "Songs <U+2013> Saint Sa<U+00EB>ns"], WorldCat, retrieved 24 February 2015</ref>

With the exception of ''Samson et Dalila'' the operas have been sparsely represented on disc.

==Honours and reputation==
Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns was made a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913. Foreign honours included the British [[Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1892) and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (1907).<ref name=times/><ref>[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U202564 "Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, Camille"], ''Who Was Who'', Oxford University Press, 2014, retrieved 21 February 2015 {{subscription}}</ref>

In its obituary notice, ''The Times'' commented:
{{quote|The death of M. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century. He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the ''doyen'' of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology. He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k|Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]], and seven years older than Sullivan. He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres.<ref name=times>"M. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns", ''The Times'', 19 December 1921, p. 14</ref>|}}

In a short poem, "Mea culpa", published in 1890 Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him.{{#tag:ref|"''Mea culpa!'' Je m'accuse de n'<U+00EA>tre point d<U+00E9>cadent."<ref>Gallois, p. 262</ref>|group= n}} An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, "His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day."<ref>"M. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's Essays", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 23 June 1910, p. 223</ref> The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic [[H. C. Colles|Henry Colles]], wrote, a few days after the composer's death:
{{quote|In his desire to maintain "the perfect equilibrium" we find the limitation of Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, "goes off the deep end". All his greatest contemporaries did. Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary. Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs.<ref>Colles, H C. "Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 22 December 1921, p. 853</ref>|}}

''Grove'' concludes its article on Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, "it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style. Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors".<ref name=g2/>

Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as ''The Carnival of the Animals'', the Second Piano Concerto, the Organ Symphony, ''Samson et Dalila'', ''Danse macabre'' and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet ''Javotte'', the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces.<ref name=nicholas /> In 2004, the cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] said, "Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself&nbsp;... there are Masses, all of which are interesting. I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece. His works are rewarding in every way. And he's an endlessly fascinating figure."<ref name=duchen />
