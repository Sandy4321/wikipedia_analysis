[[Image:OrkneyShetlandConstituency.svg|thumb|right|alt=A map of northern Scotland. Two archipelagos to the north east of the mainland are highlighted.|The Northern Isles of Scotland.]]

The '''Northern Isles''' ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: ''Nor<U+00F0>reyjar''; [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]]: ''Na h-Eileanan a Tuath'') is a chain (or [[archipelago]]) of [[island]]s off the north coast of mainland [[Scotland]]. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]].  There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing [[renewable energy]] industry. They also share a common [[Picts|Pictish]] and [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] history and both were absorbed into the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in the 15th century and then became part of the [[United Kingdom]] in the modern era.  The islands played a significant naval role during the [[World war|world wars]] of the 20th century.

Tourism is important to both archipelagos, with their distinctive prehistoric ruins playing a key part in their attraction, and there are regular ferry and air connections with mainland Scotland. The Scandinavian influence remains strong, especially in relation to local folklore and both island chains have strong, though distinct local cultures. The names of the islands are dominated by the Norse heritage, although some may retain pre-[[Celt|Celtic]] elements.

The phrase "Northern Isles" generally refers to the main islands of the Orkney and Shetland archipelagos. [[Stroma, Scotland|Stroma]], which lies between mainland Scotland and Orkney is part of [[Caithness]], and so falls under [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]] for [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] purposes, not Orkney.

The geology of Shetland is quite different. It is extremely complex, with numerous [[Fault (geology)|faults]] and [[Fold (geology)#Describing folds|fold axes]]. These islands are the northern outpost of the [[Caledonian orogeny]] and there are outcrops of [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian]], Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and [[granite]] intrusions.

To tourists, one of the fascinations of the islands is their "nightless" summers. On the [[Midsummer|longest day]] in Shetland there are over 19 hours of daylight and complete darkness is unknown.

==History, culture and politics==
{{Main|Orkney|Shetland}}

===Pictish times===
The culture that built the brochs is unknown, but by the late Iron Age the Northern Isles were  part of the [[Picts|Pictish]] kingdom.<ref>Hunter (2000) pp. 44, 49</ref> The main archaeological relics from these times are [[Pictish symbol stones|symbol stones]].

The silver bowls, jewellery and other pieces are believed to date from approximately 800 AD.  O'Dell (1959) stated that "the treasure is the best survival of Scottish silver metalwork from the period" and that "the brooches show a variety of typical Pictish forms, with both animal-head and lobed geometrical forms of terminal".<ref>O'Dell, A. ''et al'' (December 1959) "The St Ninian's Isle Silver Hoard". ''Antiquity'' '''33''' No 132.</ref><ref>O'Dell, A. ''St. Ninian's Isle Treasure. A Silver Hoard Discovered on St. Ninian's Isle, Zetland on 4th July, 1958''. Aberdeen University Studies. No. 141.</ref>

[[Christianity]] probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. The [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]] found at a Pictish site on [[Birsay]] is an [[Ogham]]&ndash;inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian in origin.<ref>Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 108</ref><ref>Ritchie, Anna "The Picts" in Omand (2003) p. 42</ref>

The 8th century was also the time the [[Viking]] invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Northern Isles,<ref>Schei (2006) pp. 11-12</ref> the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain. According to the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', Vikings then made the islands the headquarters of  [[pirate]] expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king [[Harald I of Norway|Harald H<U+00E5>rfagre]] ("Harald Fair Hair") annexed the Northern Isles in 875  and [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]] received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an [[Earl of Orkney|earldom]] as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland. (Some scholars believe that this story is apocryphal and based on the later voyages of [[Magnus III of Norway|Magnus Barelegs]].)<ref>Thomson (2008) p. 24-27</ref>

The islands were fully Christianised by [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]] in 995 when he stopped at [[South Walls]] on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the ''[[earl|jarl]]'' [[Sigurd the Stout]] and said "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel." Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke,<ref name=T69/> receiving their own [[Bishop of Orkney|bishop]] in the early 11th century.<ref>[[D. E. R.

In the 14th century  Orkney and Shetland remained a Norwegian province, but Scottish influence was growing. [[Jon Haraldsson]] who was murdered in [[Thurso]] in 1231, was the last of an unbroken line of Norse jarls,<ref>Crawford, Barbara E. "Orkney in the Middle Ages" in Omand (2003) pp. 72-73</ref> and thereafter the earls were Scots noblemen of the houses of [[Earl of Angus|Angus]] and [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|St. Clair]].<ref>Nicolson (1972) p. 44</ref> In 1468 Shetland was [[pledge (law)|pledged]] by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]], in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the [[dowry]] of his daughter [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]]. As the money was never paid, the connection with the crown of Scotland has become perpetual. In 1470 [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness]] ceded his title to James III and the following year the Northern Isles were directly annexed to Scotland.<ref>Nicolson (1972) p. 45</ref>

===Early British era===
From the early 15th century on the Shetlanders sold their goods through the [[Hanseatic League]] of German merchantmen.<ref>Schei (2006) pp. 14-16</ref><ref>Nicolson (1972) pp. 56-57</ref> This trade with the North German towns lasted until the 1707 [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] when high salt duties prohibited the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.<ref name="Visit.Shetland.org history page">[http://visit.shetland.org/history "History"]. visit.shetland.org.

British rule came at price for many ordinary people as well as traders. The Shetlanders nautical skills were sought by the the [[Royal Navy]]: some 3,000 served during the [[Napoleonic wars]] from 1800 to 1815 and [[Impressment|press gangs]] were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated.<ref>[http://shetlopedia.com/Ursula_Smith Ursula Smith"] Shetlopedia.

The Orcadian experience was somewhat different. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves ''comunitatis Orcadie'' and who proved themselves increasing able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords.<ref>Thompson (2008) p. 183</ref><ref>Crawford, Barbara E. "Orkney in the Middle Ages" in Omand (2003) pp. 78-79</ref> In the 17th century, Orcadians formed the overwhelming majority of employees of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[Canada]]. The harsh climate of Orkney and the Orcadian reputation for sobriety and their boat handling skills made them ideal candidates for the rigours of the Canadian north.<ref>Thompson (2008) pp. 371-72</ref> During this period, burning [[kelp]] briefly became a mainstay of the islands' economy.  For example on [[Shapinsay]] over {{convert|3048|t|LT|0|lk=on}} of burned seaweed were produced per annum to make [[soda ash]], bringing in <U+00A3>20,000 to the local economy.<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 364-65</ref> Agricultural improvements beginning in the 17th century resulted in the enclosure of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well-managed farms using a five-shift rotation system and producing high quality beef cattle.<ref>Thomson, William P.

Orkney was the site of a navy base at [[Scapa Flow]], which played a major role in [[World War I]]. After the [[Armistice]] in 1918, the [[German High Seas Fleet]] was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was to be made on its future; however, the German sailors opened their sea-cocks and scuttled all the ships. During World War I the 10th Cruiser Squadron was stationed at Swarbacks Minn in Shetland and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convey system. In total, Shetland lost more than 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name=Sch16>Schei (2006) p. 16</ref><ref name=N94>Nicolson (1972) pp. 91, 94-95</ref>

One month into [[World War II]], the Royal Navy battleship [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] was sunk by a German [[U-boat]] in Scapa Flow. As a result [[Churchill Barriers|barriers]] were built to close most of the access channels; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries. The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war, who also constructed the ornate [[Italian Chapel]].<ref>Thomson (2008) pp. 434-36.</ref> The Scapa Flow base was run down after the war, eventually closing in 1957.<ref name=Thom439>Thomson (2008) pp. 439-43.</ref>

During World War II a Norwegian naval unit nicknamed the "[[Shetland bus|Shetland Bus]]" was established by the [[Special Operations Executive]] in the autumn of 1940 with a base first at Lunna and later in [[Scalloway]] to conduct operations around the coast of Norway. About 30 fishing vessels used by Norwegian refugees were gathered and the Shetland Bus conducted covert operations, carrying intelligence agents, refugees, instructors for the resistance, and military supplies. It made over 200 trips across the sea with [[Leif Larsen]], the most highly decorated [[Allies of World War II|allied]] naval officer of the war, making 52 of them.<ref>[http://www.kulturnett.no/hordaland/kulturminner/kulturminne.jsp?id=T8461534&lang=no_NO "Shetlands-Larsen - Statue/monument"].

The problem of a declining population was significant in the post-war years, although in the last decades of the 20th century there was a recovery and life in the islands focused on growing prosperity and the emergence of a relatively classless society.<ref>Thomson (2008) pp. 439-43.</ref>

By contrast, fishing has declined in Orkney since the 19th century and the impact of the oil industry has been much less significant.  However, the soil of Orkney is generally very fertile and most of the land is taken up by farms, agriculture being by far the most important sector of the economy and providing employment for a quarter of the workforce.<ref>Chalmers, Jim "Agriculture in Orkney Today" in Omand (2003) p. 127, 133 quoting the Scottish Executive Agricultural Census of 2001 and stating that 80% of the land area is farmed if rough grazing is included.</ref> More than 90% of agricultural land is used for grazing for sheep and cattle, with cereal production utilising about 4% ({{convert|4200|ha|acre}}), although woodland occupies only {{convert|134|ha|acre}}.<ref name=OER>"Orkney Economic Review No. 23."

Orkney and Shetland have significant [[Wind power in Scotland|wind]] and marine energy resources, and [[Renewable energy in Scotland|renewable energy]] has recently come into prominence.

==Island names==
The [[etymology]] of the island names is dominated by Norse influence. There follows a listing of the derivation of all the inhabited islands in the Northern Isles.

===Shetland===
The oldest version of the modern name Shetland is ''Hetlandensis'' recorded in 1190 becoming ''Hetland'' in 1431 after various intermediate transformations.<ref name=G21>Gammeltoft (2010) p. 21</ref><ref name=S9>Sandnes (2010) p. 9</ref> This then became ''Hjaltland'' in the 16th century.<ref name=G22>Gammeltoft (2010) p. 22</ref> As Shetlandic [[Norn language|Norn]] was gradually replaced by [[Scots language|Scots]] ''Hjaltland'' became ''{{lang|ang|<U+021C>etland}}''. When use of the letter [[yogh]] was discontinued, it was often replaced by the similar-looking letter [[z]], hence ''Zetland'', the mis[[pronounce]]d form used to describe the pre-1975 [[Traditional counties of Scotland|county council]]. However the earlier name is ''Innse Chat'' - the island of the cats (or the cat tribe) as referred to in [[Old Irish|early Irish]] literature and it is just possible that this forms part of the Norse name.<ref name=G21/><ref name=S9/> The Cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern Scottish mainland - hence the name of [[Caithness]] via the Norse ''Katanes'' ("headland of the cat"), and the Gaelic name for [[Sutherland]], ''Cataibh'', meaning "among the Cats".<ref name=G9>Gammeltoft (2010) p. 9</ref><ref name="Watson 1994 p. 30">Watson (1994) p. 30</ref>

The location of "[[Thule]]", first mentioned by [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille#Prehistory and classical antiquity|Massilia]] when he visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC<ref name=Breeze/> is not known for certain. When [[Tacitus]] mentioned it in AD 98 it is clear he was referring to Shetland.<ref>Watson (1994) p. 7</ref>

The Norse retained the earlier root but changed the meaning, providing the only definite example of an adaption of a pre-Norse place name in the Northern Isles. The islands became ''Orkneyar'' meaning "seal islands".<ref name=G8>Gammeltoft (2010) pp. 8-9</ref> An alternative name for Orkney is recorded in 1300<U+2014>Hrossey, meaning "horse isle" and this may also contain a Pictish element of ''ros'' meaning "moor" or "plain".<ref name=G21/>

Unlike most of the larger Orkney islands, the derivation of the name "Shapinsay" is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for ''island'', but the first two syllables are more difficult to interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be ''hjalpandis-<U+00F8>y'' (helpful island) due to the presence of a good harbour, although anchorages are plentiful in the archipelago.<ref name=H364>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 364</ref> The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to ''Scalpandisay'', which may suggest a derivation from "judge's island". Another suggestion is "Hyalpandi's island", although no one of that name is known to have been associated with Shapinsay.<ref name=Orkneyjar>[http://www.orkneyjar.com/placenames/pl-isle.htm "Orkney Placenames"] Orkneyjar.

===Uninhabited islands===
Stroma, from the Norse ''Straum<U+00F8>y''<ref name=H336>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 336</ref> means "current island"<ref>Mac an T<U+00E0>illeir (2003) p. 109</ref>
or "island in the tidal stream",<ref name=H336/> a reference to the strong currents in the Pentland Firth. The Norse often gave animal names to islands and these have been transferred into English in for example, the [[Calf of Flotta]] and [[Horse of Copinsay]]. [[Brother Isle]] is an anglicisation of the Norse ''brei<U+00F0>are<U+00F8>y'' meaning "broad beach island".<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 465</ref> The Norse ''holmr'', meaning  "a small islet" has become "[[Holm (island)|Holm]]" in English and there are numerous examples of this use including [[Corn Holm]], [[Thieves Holm]] and [[Little Holm, Yell Sound|Little Holm]].<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holm "Holm"]. Wiktionary. Retrieved 27 May 2011.</ref> "Muckle" meaning large or big is one of few [[Scots language|Scots]] words in the island names of the ''Nordreyar'' and appears in [[Muckle Roe]] and [[Muckle Flugga]] in Shetland and [[Muckle Green Holm]] and [[Muckle Skerry]] in Orkney. Many small islets and skerries have Scots or [[Insular Scots]] names such as Da Skerries o da Rokness and Da Buddle Stane  in Shetland, and Kirk Rocks in Orkney.
