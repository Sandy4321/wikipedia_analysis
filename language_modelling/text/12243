== History ==

In February 1995, [[Sully Erna]] wanted to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including over two years in the now defunct band Strip Mind.<ref name="Godsmack biography">{{cite web |url= http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |title=Godsmack <U+2013> Bio |accessdate=2007-10-10 |last= |first=|date=|publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref> Later that year, Erna called his friend [[Robbie Merrill]], asking if he wanted to start writing music, and Merrill agreed.<ref name="Godsmack biography2">{{cite web |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Godsmack-Biography/42DDEE8351B35F7B482568E30007AE16  |title=Godsmack biography |accessdate=2007-11-09 |publisher=Sing365.com}}</ref>  His new band The Scam formed with Erna on vocals, Merrill on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and [[Tommy Stewart]] on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.<ref name="Rolling Stone with Sully">{{cite web| author=Scaggs, Austin |date=[[2003-05-06]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/godsmack/articles/story/5936304/sully_awakes |title=Sully Awakes |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |accessdate=2007-12-02}}</ref> The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometowns of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and [[Salem, New Hampshire]]. Godsmack started out as an [[Alice in Chains]] cover band, but moved on quickly to write its own music.<ref name="Bands on demand <U+2013> Godsmack">{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=godsmack&cat=alternative&full=Godsmack |title=Ugo <U+2013> Bands on demand <U+2013> Godsmack |accessdate=2007-11-10 |publisher=Ugo }}</ref>  Locally popular songs such as "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" and "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]" brought them quickly to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

The band's name, according to Merrill in the ''[[Smack This!]]'' DVD, was stolen from Alice in Chains' song "[[God Smack (song)|God Smack]]". However, Erna stated in a 1999 interview that "I was making fun of somebody who had a cold sore on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, 'It's a godsmack.' The name stuck. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it. It's a cool song and the name had meaning for
us".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/1999/godsmack_int.asp |title=Sully Erna of Godsmack on Karma, Christians and the Law of Three (NY Rock) |accessdate=2007-10-10 |first=Gabriella |date=[[1999-10-01]] |publisher=Nyrock.com}}</ref>

=== Early works (1996<U+2013>1997) ===

In 1996, [[Tony Rombola]] and Joe D'arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left after finding out he had a six year old child and Stewart left due to personal differences.<ref name="Godsmack biography2"/><ref name="Richards leaving stuff">{{cite web| author=Seaver, Morley |url=http://www.rocknworld.com/morley/06/Godsmack.shtml |title=MorleyView Interview with Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |publisher=MorleyView |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> In the same year the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled ''[[All Wound Up (album)|All Wound Up]]'', with Erna playing drums and the rest of the band playing their respective instruments.<ref name="Godsmack biography2"/> The CD was recorded in just three days for [[United States dollar|$]]2,500.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> 

For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of "Rocko", a DJ for Boston radio station [[WAAF (FM)]]. The radio station put "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

In an interview Erna stated, "we had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. It was insane. Even crazier, I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smackfans.com/ |title=Smackfans.com <U+2013> Godsmack fan site |accessdate=2007-10-10 |publisher=<U+00A9> 2000-2006 Smackfans.com. All rights reserved. }}</ref>

=== Self-titled album, success, and controversy (1998<U+2013>1999) ===

In the summer of 1998, [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]] signed the band onto their label. D'arco left the band for unknown reasons and was replaced by once former drummer [[Tommy Stewart]], who came back after longing to be in the band again.<ref name="Godsmack biography2"/><ref name="Drummer switch">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&Date=8/13/2002 |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Speaks out on drummer switch |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=[[2002-08-13]] |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> The band's first studio recording ''All Wound Up'' was re-mastered. The finished self-titled debut CD ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' was released to the public six weeks later, leading to the band's first headlining tour, "The Voodoo Tour".<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>
After the CD's release the band hit the road playing club shows as well as playing "[[Ozzfest]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |title=Ozzfest <U+2013> History/2001 <U+2013> Copyright <U+2013> 2007 Live Nation |accessdate=2007-11-08 |publisher=Ozzfest.com }}</ref> and "[[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yottamusic.com/albums/various/Woodstock-99-Vol-1:-Red-Album-(Explicit)/|title=Godsmack at Woodstock '99 <U+2013> Yottamusic |accessdate=2007-11-08 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Yottamusic.com }}</ref> Roxanne Blanford from the ''[[All Music Guide]]'' gave the album three out of five stars, stating,  "Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wc08.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:qjuh6j4o71u0|title=Godsmack <U+2013> self-titled review |accessdate=2007-11-09 |last=Blanford |first=Roxanne |date= |publisher=''All Music Guide'' }}</ref> The album was the band's first to enter the [[Billboard 200]] at number 22,<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web

The album caused controversy due to its profane lyrics, containing a substantial amount of swearing.<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy">{{cite web| title=Godsmack Lyrics and Biography |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002718/Godsmack.html| accessdate=2007-11-10| last=Schwalboski |first=Ann M.|publisher=Musician guide }}</ref> After listening to his son's copy of the album, a father in the U.S. complained to [[Wal-Mart]], who sold him the album, that the lyrics were offensive. Wal-Mart and [[Kmart]] took the album off the shelves. The band and its record label later added a [[Parental Advisory]] sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented on the situation to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, stating, "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint<U+2026>. Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective<U+2026>. We have decided to put a sticker on the record".<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy"/> This controversy did not hurt album sales, but according to Erna helped, stating, "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it".<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy"/>

=== ''Awake'' (2000<U+2013>2002) ===

In 2000, Godsmack returned to the studio after the multi-platinum success of ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' to start recording ''[[Awake (Godsmack album)|Awake]]''. The album was released on [[October 31]], [[2000]]. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="Billboard"/> "[[Vampires (song)|Vampires]]", a song on the album, also earned the band a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2002/grammys.htm |title=Rock On The Net: 44th Annual Grammy Awards <U+2013> 2002 |publisher=Rock on the Net |accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref> 
With the release of ''Awake'', Godsmack toured [[Europe]] supporting [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=12414 |title=Godsmack <U+2013> Tour 2001 |publisher=Godsmack.com |accessdate=2007-11-10}}</ref> Erna said at the time, "we've been touring nonstop since August of 1998, So most of ''Awake'' was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. "[[Ozzfest]]" was actually the only big
tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godsmack.com |title=Godsmack <U+2013> Home |accessdate=2007-10-10 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Godsmack.com }}</ref>

Two of the songs on the album were used in U.S. military commercials ("Sick of Life" and "Awake") as background music. Erna stated, "Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51830 |title=Godsmack Frontman Gets Defensive Over Band's Alleged 'Pro-Military' Stance |accessdate=2007-11-10 |first=Arthur |date=[[2006-05-04]] |publisher=Arthur Magazine }}</ref>

=== ''Faceless'' (2003) ===

In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. The motion picture was the third in the Mummy saga, and was a spin-off prequel of the Mummy series. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled "[[I Stand Alone (song)|I Stand Alone]]" and became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quasimodobell.com/default.aspx?groupid=972&tabid=130 |title=Godsmack |accessdate=2007-11-10 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref>

The album got its name after a [[pool]] incident, retold by Larkin; "Sully and I were standing up for one more jump, we're both there buck-naked, and I look over to the left and there's some woman who had just opened the blinds standing there with her mouth wide open". Erna added, "She was just waking up, we go, 'Sorry', and then boom, right into the pool. The next thing we know the cops are banging on the door, and that's sort of the point of calling the record ''Faceless''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/godsmack/news_feature_030418/index2.jhtml |title=Godsmack: Unpolished, Uncompromised

=== ''The Other Side'' EP (2004<U+2013>2005) ===

On [[March 16]], [[2004]] ''[[The Other Side (Godsmack album)|The Other Side]]'', an acoustic [[Extended play|EP]] was released from Godsmack. The album debuted at number five on the U.S. [[Billboard 200]], this is a relatively high position for an acoustic EP.<ref name="Billboard"/> It included several previously released songs re-recorded as acoustic versions, as well as three new acoustic tracks. One new song, "[[Touch<U+00E9> (song)|Touch<U+00E9>]]", featured Godsmack's first guitar player, Lee Richards, as well as John Kosco, who were at that time in the now defunct band [[Dropbox]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488133/20040603/dropbox.jhtml |title=Ex-Godsmack Guitarist Finds Second Act <U+2013> News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News|accessdate=2007-10-10 |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=[[2004-06-03]] |publisher=MTV News }}</ref> The other two new acoustic tracks were "[[Running Blind (song)|Running Blind]]" and "Voices".<ref name="The Other Side on Godsmack discography">{{cite web

This is one of the many comparisons to Alice in Chains that the band has been criticized for.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/godsmacks_acoustic_album.html |title="Ultimate Guitar <U+2013> Godsmack's acoustic album" |accessdate=2007-11-08 |date=[[2003-10-13]] |publisher=MTV.com }}</ref>

=== ''IV'' (2006) ===

On [[April 25]], [[2006]] Godsmack released its fourth studio album simply titled ''[[IV (Godsmack album)|IV]]'', followed by a tour that would continue until August 2007, titled "The IV tour".<ref>{{cite web|title=Godsmack tour '07 |publisher=Godsmack <U+2013> 2007 Tour archive|url=http://www.godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=29109|accessdate=2007-11-08| |publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref>  The album was produced by Erna and engineered by the well known producer and engineer [[Andy Johns]], known for engineering [[Led Zeppelin]]'s ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]''.<ref name="Interview with Larkin">{{cite web |url=http://entertainment-news-network-archive.blogspot.com/2006/06/interview-shannon-larkin-of-godsmack.html  |title=Interview: Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |accessdate=2007-11-10 |last=Fuoco |first=Christina |date=[[2006-06-23]] |publisher=Entertainment News }}</ref> The first single from the album, "[[Speak (song)|Speak]]" was released on [[February 14]], [[2006]].

''IV'' has since been certified platinum.<ref name="Godsmack <U+2013> 10 Years of Godsmack arrives December 4th"/> The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, "it's Sully's band and his vision. He sifted through all the music and picked the songs that he wanted on the album. We all said 'all right'. He's always had the vision of everything Godsmack from the artwork to the production to the engineer to the studio to what TV shows we play. Everything.

The name not only came to, from being the band's fourth studio album, but also a comical story as stated by Larkin and Erna,

{{Quote|"Absolutely, man. We have this security guy, a big, tough guy named J.C. He's another Boston guy. And in Boston it's "fou." They don't really have the "R." It's not "four," it's "fou." He'd be hanging around backstage and chicks would walk by and he would rate them from one to 10. But if it wasn't a 10, there was no one, two, three, or five. It was always you were a 10 or a fou. He just pulled the funniest things. Sometimes, he'd just hold up four fingers and wouldn't have to say it anymore and we'd all just bust out laughing. And then the funniest one, this guy walked by with a chick on each arm and he goes, "Hey, bub, two fous don't make an eight!" So when it came up, it's our fourth full-length record, everybody was like, "Fou!" And we were like, "That's it, man." We're not trying to break any records for originality here. I know that there's ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'', ''[[4 (album)|Foreigner IV]]'', a million IVs. We just thought it's fitting".<ref name="Interview with Shannon">{{cite web |url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_godsmack.html |title=<U+2018>Livin in Sin' with Godsmack's Shannon Larkin |accessdate=2007-11-10 |last= |first=|date=[[2006-05-06]]|publisher=Live-Metal.Net}}</ref><ref name="The music and magic of Godsmack
