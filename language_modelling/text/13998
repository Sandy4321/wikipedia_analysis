'''Kofi Tavernier''' was  a fictional character in the BBC soap opera ''EastEnders''.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1991/gallery/eastenders-kofitavernier.shtml |title= 1991 photo gallery|publisher=''I Love 1991'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> He was played by Marcel Smith from 1990 to 1993.<ref name="EEHandbook"/> 

==Character creation and development==
The Tavernier family were introduced in 1990 by the newly appointed executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]].<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref> The introduction of the Tavernier family heralded the first time that an entire family had joined ''EastEnders'' all at the same time<U+2014>all except Kofi, who first appeared several months after the core familiy's introduction. The Taverniers were also a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the show.<ref name="first10years"/>

It took a long time to cast the complete Tavernier family. Once ''EastEnders'' became a success, the producers had no difficulties in finding "good actors" who wanted to join the cast; however, what became hard was finding families<U+2014>combinations of performers who "look and sound as though they could be related."<ref name="EEHandbook">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN 0-563-206010-563-36292-8-2}}</ref> According to producers [[Corinne Hollingworth]] and [[Pat Sandys]], the Taveriner family were especially difficult, as upon Kofi's arrival, four male generations of the family were being featured, great grandfather [[Jules Tavernier|Jules]], grandfather [[Celestine Tavernier|Celestine]], father [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] and son Kofi. Hollingworth has commented "The most difficult job we've had was finding<U+2026>black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family."<ref name="EEHandbook"/> 

Kofi's backstory was told through Clyde before he made an appearance<U+2014>he was a result of a relationship between Clyde and a girl named Abigail (unseen in the serial). Until December 1990, Kofi lived outside of the area that the soap is set<U+2014>remaining with his maternal grandparents in Bristol following the death of his mother. Clyde accepted this as he was unable to provide financially for his child, a fact that he was seen to agonise over, and a source of friction between him and his father Celestine.<ref name="EEHandbook"/> Clyde eventually brought Kofi to live with him in Walford when Abigail's parents threatened to take Kofi to live in the West Indies.<ref name="20years">{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|id=ISBN 0-563-52165-1}}</ref> Kofi was often in scenes with another child actress, Samantha Leigh-Martin, who played [[Vicki Fowler]]. Their friendship was part of the reason that Clyde and Vicki's mother, [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]], formed a relationship. He was also featured in a special set of offset episodes, written by [[Tony Jordan]] and airing in November 1991. The episodes were the climax of a "mini-storyline" that saw Clyde and Michelle go "on the run" from the police with Kofi and Vicki, after Clyde was falsely accused of murder. Directed by Mike Dormer, the episode has been described as one "of the most exciting thriller episodes of ''EastEnders''."<ref name="first10years"/> 

Kofi remained in the programme until July 1993, when he and his father Clyde were written out of the serial. On-screen Clyde left Walford with Kofi to explore his roots in Trinidad.<ref name="first10years"/>

==Storylines==
Kofi was the son of [[Clyde Tavernier]] and he initially lived with his maternal grandparents in [[Bristol]] following the death of his mother, Abigail.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_clyde_t.shtml |title= Clyde Tavernier|publisher=''BBC'' |accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> After Clyde discovered that Kofi's grandparents were planning on emigrating to [[Jamaica]] with his son, he tailed them to the airport and brought Kofi back to [[Walford]] on [[Christmas day]] [[1990]].

Kofi became friendly with [[Vicki Fowler]] at a toddler group, and as a result of their friendship Clyde grew close to Vicki's mother, [[Michelle Fowler]]. 

In [[1991]], Kofi's father was wrongly accused of the murder of [[Eddie Royle]] and so Clyde and Michelle went on the run and took Vicki and Kofi with them in an ill-fated attempt to start a new life together in [[France]]. However, Clyde was arrested before he could escape and was subsequently imprisoned. During this time Kofi was looked after by the rest of the Taverniers until Clyde was cleared of all charges and released three months later.

In July [[1993]], Clyde and Kofi emigrated to [[Trinidad]] to live with Clyde's girlfriend [[Gidea Thompson]], who was also his cousin.
