'''Carnoustie''' is a town and former [[police burgh]] in the [[subdivisions of Scotland|council area]] of [[Angus]], [[Scotland]]. It is situated at the mouth of the [[Barry, Angus|Barry]] [[Burn (topography)|Burn]] on the east coast of Scotland. 

The town was founded in the late [[18th Century]], and grew rapidly throughout the [[19th Century]] due to the expansion of the local [[textile]] industry. It was popular as a tourist resort from the early [[Victorian era]] up to the end of [[World War II]], due to its seaside location. It is best known for its associations with [[golf]].

Carnoustie is twinned with [[Maule, Yvelines|Maule]], approximately 50 km west of [[Paris]], [[France]]<ref>[http://www.carnoustie-twinning.org.uk/ Carnoustie Twinning Association], www.carnoustie-twinning.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>, due to Carnoustie and its surrounding area's long association with the Maule Family.<ref>[http://www.maulefamily.com/brianarchive/town.htm Maule Family History], www.maulefamily.com; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>

Carnoustie's closest city is [[Dundee]]. It is served primarily by [[Carnoustie railway station]] and infrequently by [[Golf Street railway station]]. Its nearest major road is the [[A92 road|A92]].

==History==
===Toponymy===
The origin of the name 'Carnoustie' is uncertain, although it possibly derives from the [[Gaelic]] 'C<U+00E0>rn fheusta' (The rock of the feast/pinewood).  It is also possible that it has an earlier [[Pictish]] origin, predating the [[gaelicization|gaelicisation]] of [[Angus]]. Pictish is thought to have been a [[Brythonic]] language and the prefix 'Car', meaning 'fort', is known from [[Welsh]] (eg. [[Carmarthen]]) and [[Cumbric]] (eg. [[Carlisle]]). 

[[Folk etymology]] suggests that the name has a later, [[Anglic]] origin. The name is supposed to derive from the [[scots language|scots]] 'Craws Nestie', referring to the large number of [[crow]]s that inhabit the area. This tradition is alluded to in the coat of arms of Carnoustie, which includes a pair of crows.<ref>[http://cjmvm.free.fr/scotland/nos_villes/carnoustie/herald.htm Coat of Arms of Carnoustie], cjmvm.free.fr; retrieved 3 September 2008.</ref>

Other, less likely suggestions include that it derives from 'Cairn of the Host'<ref name="Dundee statistics">Small, R. (1842)[http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&id=eKIJAAAAIAAJ&dq=dundee+origin&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=jQ4Jkwwdw-&sig=YereOqIIAxnTGB3hY0hsbEVH56k&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result The history of Dundee from its origin to the present time] J.

While it is a likely possibility is that the word 'Carnoustie' has a Gaelic origin, the town does not have an alternative Gaelic name. By the time the town was founded, that part of Angus was exclusively English-speaking<ref name="Panbride stats1">Trail, R. (1791) [http://www.monikie.org.uk/statisticalaccounts-panbride.htm First Statistical Accounts for Scotland, Parish of Panbride (County of Forfar)], www.monikie.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>, and the town of Carnoustie has only ever been known by its present name.

Ultimately the origin of the name is unknown but predates the town itself by several hundred years. 'Carnusie' farm is recorded in the [[Balmerino Abbey]] register of c1575<ref name="Dickson"/>, which states that it (along with part of Grange of Barry and Badiehill) was feued to a man by the name of Fairney for the annual sum of [[Pound (currency)|<U+00A3>]]24.2[[shilling|s]] and several chickens<ref name="Dickson">Dickson, R. and Dickson, G.C.

===Early History===
Carnoustie was thought for many years to be the site of the legendary Battle of Barry in which the [[Scottish people|Scots]], supposedly led by [[Malcolm II of Scotland|Malcolm II]], defeated a [[Viking|Danish]] invasion force in 1010 AD. The history of the event relies heavily on [[oral tradition|tradition]] and it is currently considered to be [[apocryphal]].

The legend states that the Scots army gathered on Carnoustie beach and, from there, ambushed the Danish Army whose objective was to take Dundee. It is said that the Scots defeated the Danes, who suffered losses so great that the the Lochty [[burn (topography)|burn]], which runs through the town, ran red with blood for three days.<ref>For an uncritcal (and outdated) account of the battle, see for example [http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&id=eKIJAAAAIAAJ&dq=dundee+origin&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=jQ4Jkwwdw-&sig=YereOqIIAxnTGB3hY0hsbEVH56k&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result Small (1842)] or [[James Aitken Wylie|Wylie, J.A.]] (1886) [http://www.electricscotland.com/history/wylie/vol3ch10.htm History of the Scottish Nation, Vol. III, Chapter 10], Hamilton, Adams & Co, Edinburgh, www.electricscotland.com; retrieved 3 September 2008. <small>Wylie quotes Gordon, A. (1726) Itinerarium Septentirional p 154-155: <i>About eight miles from Brechin, at Karboddo[Kirkbuddo], a place belongs to the Earl of Crawford, are to be seen the vestiges of a Danish camp, fortified with a rampart and ditch, and vulgarly called Norway Dikes; near which is the village of Panbridge [Pandbride], where anciently was a church dedicated to St Brigide, because on that saint<U+2019>s day which preceded the battle, Camus, general of the Danes, pitched his camp there. Not far from hence is the village of Barry, where a mighty battle was fought betwixt the Danes and Scots, with great slaughter on both sides, near the mouth of a small rivulet called Lough-tay [Lochty Burn]. There many little artificial mounts, or tumuli, are still to be seen, within which were buried the bodies of those slain in the fight; and because the soil thereabouts is sandy, the wind blowing away the sand frequently discovers bones of a size much exceeding those of our age. Near this is Camus-Town [Camuston], a village belonging to the barons of Panmure, and noted for the death of Camus, slain there, it being a mile from the field of battle. There to this day is to be seen an obelisk. . . .Nine years after I wrote that treatise, a plough turning up the ground discovered a sepulchre, believed to be that of Camus, enclosed with four great stones. Here a huge skeleton was dug up, supposed to have been the body of Camus;<U+2019> it appeared to have received its death by a wound on the back part of the head, seeing a considerable part of the skill was cut away, and probably by the stroke of a sword.</i> The camp at Kirkbuddo is currently thought to be a temporary [[Roman empire|Roman]] marching camp [http://www.roman-britain.org/places/kirkbuddo.htm Kirkbuddo camp], www.roman-britain.org; retrieved 3 September 2008.</small></ref> The leader of the Danes, Camus, fled the battlefield, pursued by Robert de Keith (ancestor of the [[Earl Marischal|Marischals of Scotland]]), who caught up with and slew him at Brae Downie where, it is said, the Camus Cross was erected in memory of him.<ref name="Camuscross">[http://www.monikie.org.uk/panmure2.htm The Camus Cross], www.monikie.org.uk; retrieved 2 September 2008</ref>

No record of the event is found before that written by [[Boece|Hector Boece]] in the sixteenth century<ref name="dickson1878">Dickson, R. (1878) [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_012/12_611_615.pdf Notice of the discovery of stone coffins at Carnoustie, Forfarshire], Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland 12, 611-615, ads.ahds.ac.uk; retrieved 2 September 2008. <small>Dickson reports three long cist burials disinterred in 1878. The burials were aligned with feet pointing to the east, signifying [[Christian burial]] and, despite Gordon's (1726) assertions about size, gives a femur size of 18" (46 cm), suggesting a height of 5'6" (1.67 m) for the largest skeleton. Dickson also refers to 30 cists unearthed in 1810 during the construction of what is now the Erskine United Free Church. He also points out the lack of weapons, casting doubt on Boece's account of the Battle of Barry.</small></ref>. The legend appears to have originated due to a romantic misinterpretation of the numerous [[Tumulus|tumuli]] that existed towards the eastern boundary of Barry Parish, near the Lochty burn before the town was founded<ref name="Barry stats1"/>, a number of which were disinterred during early building work.<ref name="dickson1878"/><ref name="lewis">Lewis, S.

===Thomas Lowson and the origin of the town===
[[Image:Dibble tree.jpg|thumb|225px|left|<small>Thomas Lowson's Dibble Tree</small>]]
In the late 1700s Charles Gardyne, Freeholder of Ravensby<ref>Headrick, J. (1813) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mg4AAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA118&lpg=RA1-PA118&dq=gardyne+ravensby&source=web&ots=2M5cj-zK4e&sig=aipETCb0GDuLgXWyy1_1DAdEOow&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPR3,M1 General view of the agriculture of Angus or Forfarshire with observations on the means of its improvement] Neill & Company, Edinburgh</ref> marked out a road between the villages of [[Barry, Angus|Barry]] and West Haven, using a four horse plough. Its path followed the Barry Burn for a while, then took a straight course towards West Haven. On encountering a rocky outcrop, Gardyne had to divert his horses slightly to the North. This diversion remains today as the corner between Barry Road and Dundee Street. From there, he continued straight to West Haven, passing the Point Inn which stood immediately behind where the Municipal Buildings were built in 1896, opposite the Kinloch Arms Hotel.<ref name="Dickson"/>

It was along this road that Thomas Lowson, a loom wright who lived in Barry, was returning home one day in 1797 from a trip to Inverpeffer.<ref name="Dickson"/><ref>Inverpeffer was a small hamlet, once a barony, in St Vigeans that once existed where the disused airfield now stands, half a mile to the east of Hatton Farm. It can still be seen as a village in the [http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/os_scotland_popular_list.html 1921-1930 One inch edition of the Ordnance Survey maps] on sheet 58, Arbroath & Montrose, www.nls.uk; retrieved 3 September 2008</ref> After passing the Point Inn, some say stopping there a while, he took a rest and slept for a while, and upon waking feeling especially refreshed, decided to approach the owner of the land, Major William Phillips, and ask to rent a small area of land. Phillips, the former valet of Panmure estate, bought Carnoustie estate from Bailie Milne in 1792 for the price of <U+00A3>5,000 on his return from India, renaming it 'Taymouth'. Phillips was surprised by Lowson's request, as it the land was thought to be agronomically poor, but granted Lowson the first [[feu]] of two acres of land for seventy shillings. On hearing about it, Phillips' wife took pity on the apparently deluded Lowson and refunded him five shillings<ref name="Dickson"/>. A popular legend has it that Lowson, while planting crops on his new land, lost the willow dibble stick he had been using, later finding it to have sprouted. The 'Dibble Tree', a magnificent specimens of [[Crack Willow]] (''Salix fragilis'') can still be seen, off Ferrier Street, and is listed as one of the hundred Treefest Heritage Trees of Scotland<ref>[http://www.treefestscotland.org.uk/treefest/ACHS-529L8E Heritage Trees Of Scotland], www.treefestscotland.org.uk; retrieved 21 October 2007</ref>. 

Lowson proved his detractors wrong and enjoyed so much success on his land in his first year that a number of his friends applied for feus in the following years. The estate was purchased from Phillips in 1808 by George Kinloch for the price of <U+00A3>11,000. Kinloch restored the name of Carnoustie and promoted the growth of the village, setting up brickworks and granting loans to prospective feuers to allow them to settle.<ref name="Dickson"/> By the mid-19th century, the population of the town had risen to more than a thousand.<ref name="lewis"/> For many years, the village was known simply as 'The Feus' and an 1832 map of the area shows The Feus as being a number of properties, largely concentrated in the area to the west of the Lochty burn<ref>[http://www.nls.uk/maps/early/516.html John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832], www.nls.uk; retrieved 19 October 2007</ref>.  

Lowson died in 1856 at the age of 92. He can be seen on both the [[United Kingdom Census 1841|1841 census]], where his occupation is listed as 'carpenter', and the [[United Kingdom Census 1841|1851 census]], where he is listed simply as the 'First Ferth in Carnoustie'. His original thatched cottage was improved extensively in the 19th century by his son William and can still be seen on the south side of Dundee Street, not far to the west of The Cross, where it still bears the name 'First Feu Cottage'.

===Industry in Carnoustie===

Early in its history, Carnoustie was dominated by the [[linen]] industry. [[Flax]] was grown in considerable quantities in the area and supplemented by several tonnes imported annually from [[Riga]] and [[St Petersburg]]. The predominant occupation listed in the [[United Kingdom Census 1841|1841 census]] and 1843 statistical account for Barry Parish is that of 'Linen [[Loom|Hand Loom]] [[Weaver (occupation)|Weaver]]'.<ref name="Barry stats2">Lumsden, J. (1843) [http://www.monikie.org.uk/statisticalaccounts-barry.htm Second Statistical Accounts for Scotland, Parish of Barrie, Presbytery of Arbroath, Synod of Angus and Mearns], www.monikie.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref> The linen industry expanded significantly in the early [[19th Century]], supporting a population increase in the Barry Parish from 796 in 1791<ref name="Barry stats1"> to 2,124 by the time of the 1841 census.<ref name="Barry stats2">

Aside from the linen industry, the economy rested mainly on agriculture and fishing. Major crops of that period were of [[potatoes]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[oats]], [[peas]], [[turnips]], and [[clover]]<ref name="Barry stats1"/> (used as animal feed as well as for soil improvement in [[crop rotation|rotation with other crops]]); much of which was sold on to markets in local towns. [[Cattle]] were raised for export to [[England]]. [[Atlantic salmon|Salmon]] were caught in the salmon nets on Carnoustie beach<ref name ="Barry stats2"/>, and the small fishing fleets of Westhaven and Easthaven caught [[cod]] for export and [[haddock]] which was largely destined for [[Dundee]] and [[Forfar]]. [[Lobster]]s were caught for live export to [[London]] and [[Edible crab|crab]]s were caught for local use.<ref name="Panbride stats2">Trail, D.

The arrival of the [[Dundee and Arbroath Railway]] in 1838 encouraged major industrial growth in the town and shortly after, the [[Vitriol]] Works opened near the railway line, on ground to the west of the town, producing [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] used largely in the production of agricultural [[fertilizer|fertiliser]]. The Panbride [[Bleachfield]], at which linen from the expanding local industry was [[bleach]]ed, opened adjacent to the railway near the mouth of the Craigmill [[Burn (topography)|burn]] on land which is now occupied by David Murray Transport.<ref>[http://www.davidmurraytrans.co.uk/about.htm David Murray Transport], www.davidmurraytrans.co.uk; retrieved 4 September 2008</ref> This was supplied with water from the burn via the ponds that can now be seen in the grounds of Panbride House.

[[Image:Panmureworks.JPG|thumb|225px|left|<small>James Smieton's Panmure Works, built 1857. Now housing D.J. Laing</small>]]In 1851, shoe maker John Winter opened a shop near The Cross. His business grew such that he built a large factory in 1874 at the foot of East Path (now Park Avenue/Queen Street), employing 200 people and producing 2000 pairs of shoes and boots a week. His son, George, took over the business and built the impressive mansion, Winterdyne, that overlooks Carnoustie House Grounds at the top of Queen Street. Production ceased in 1952.<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/buildings/winterdyne.htm The Winter family and Winterdyne, Queens Street, Carnoustie], www.angus.gov.uk; retrieved 22 October 2007</ref>

The linen industry in Carnoustie was modernised in 1857 with the opening of The Panmure Works by James Smieton. This factory, which at its height employed 600 employees, was a state-of-the-art facility containing 400 modern [[power looms]] and produced six million [[yards]] of [[linen]] and [[jute]] annually. Smieton also built new housing on a number of streets in the surrounding area for his employees and, in 1865, he opened the Panmure Works Institute on Kinloch Street which provided a library, [[cue sports|billiard]] room and a hall for the education and recreation of his workers. The firm went through several changes of ownership through its history and was owned by WG Grant & Co Ltd from 1932 until 1972 when it went into liquidation.<ref>[http://www.dundee.ac.uk/archives/ms047.htm WG Grant & Co Ltd, Linen Manufacturers, Panmure Works, Carnoustie], www.dundee.ac.uk; retrieved 22 October 2007</ref> The factory building was restored in the late 1990s and now houses the building firm DJ Laing.

The smaller Taymouth Linen works were opened in 1867 to the west of Panmure Works and the Vitriol Works, and at its height contained 100 power looms. Again, additional housing was built by the owners, the Brodies, including Taymouth Terrace.

===Tourism and Recreation in Carnoustie===
[[Image:Carnoustie.jpg|thumb|225px|right|<small>Carnoustie beach</small>]]

In addition to bringing industry to Carnoustie, the opening of the railway also made the town appealing to the [[middle classes]], who used it as a [[commuter town]] for [[Dundee]]. A further benefit brought by the railway was the tourism industry, which took advantage of Carnoustie's seaside location and of the [[Links (golf)|Golf links]]. Carnoustie, as a popular tourist destination was, along with other Scottish resorts, popularly promoted as the '[[Brighton]] of the North' in the early 20th Century.<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/featcarn.htm Carnoustie, Brighton of the North], www.angus.gov.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.teetimescotland.com/teetime/history.php?historyid=71 TeeTime Scotland: Scottish Golf History], www.teetimescotland.com; retrieved 3 September 2008</ref> Tourism, however, declined somewhat after [[World War II]], largely due to the increased availability (and falling price) of package tours to warmer parts of the world.<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/2004-05-carnoustiehistory.htm Carnoustie - A Brief Look At Carnoustie To The Early 20th Century], www.angus.gov.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref> 

In 1890, Arthur George Maule Ramsey, 14th [[Earl of Dalhousie]], sold the links to the local council. As the authority was unable to borrow the money to acquire the site, the people of Carnoustie held a series of fund raising activities to raise the money for the purchase, thus securing the future of the links for golfing and leisure.{{fact}}

==Governance==
Carnoustie is represented within [[Angus|Angus Council]] by the Carnoustie & District ward, from which three councillors are elected. The members elected from this ward are, as of 2008; Helen Oswald ([[Scottish National Party]]), Peter Murphy ([[Scottish Labour Party|Labour Party]]) and Ralph Palmer ([[Scottish National Party]]).<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/councillorinfo/viewWard.cfm?w=5 Councillor Information - Carnoustie & District], www.angus.gov.uk; retrieved 3 September 2008</ref>

===Parliamentary representation===
*Carnoustie is part of the [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East constituency]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which returns a Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], at [[Westminster]].

*Carnoustie is part of the [[Angus (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] which has significantly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]] directly, and is part of the [[North East Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|North East Scotland electoral region]] with regards to additional Members of the Scottish Parliament.

==Education==
===History of Education in Carnoustie===
[[Image:Kinloch.jpg|thumb|225px|left|<small>Carnoustie Public School, later Kinloch Primary School</small>]]Prior to the [[Education in Scotland#Compulsory_education|Education (Scotland) Act 1872]], the provision of schools in Scotland was the responsibility of the parish. The [[Education Act 1696|Education Act of 1696]] allowed churches to set up schools, funded mainly by the landowner.

At the start of the 1870s, each church in Carnoustie had its own school. Some of these can still be seen today, in the former primary schools of Barry and Panbride, which were at that point the schools of Panbride Parish Church and Barry Free Church, and the Phillip Hall on Dundee Street, which was the school connected with The Erskine Free Church.

These were supplemented with a number of private subscription schools, including a school in Links Avenue, opened in 1831, that now houses the local [[Scouting|Scout Group]]<ref>see for example, Ordnance Survey (1858) [http://www.nls.uk/maps/os/6inch/forfarshire.html Six inch maps of Scotland, Forfarshire, sheet LI]; retrieved 3 September 2008</ref> and a school off Maule Street that is now used as Holyrood Church's Hall. These were both victims of the success of Carnoustie Free Church school and were abandoned. More successful were the school linked to Panmure Works and a private Girls School in Kinloch Street, but these too were made redundant by the 1872 act.<ref name="Dickson"/>

Carnoustie Public School was built in 1878 near the Free Church school on Dundee Street.<ref name="Dickson"/> It was extended several times before the secondary school pupils were decanted to the new Carnoustie High School building in Shanwell Road. The old school was renamed Kinloch Primary School, and continued until 2006, when it and Barry and Panbride Primary Schools were closed as part of the reorganisation of schools in the area.

Clockwise from top left: Panbride Church; Newton Church; Erskine United Free Church; St Annes RC Church; Barry Church; Carnoustie Church</small>]]The Parish Church in Barry was built in 1800 on the site of an earlier building which was described as being "old and sorry" in the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland| First Statistical Accounts of Scotland]].<ref name="Barry stats1"/> This was insufficient to house its congregation and the refusal of the [[Heritor]]s to fund its enlargement led to much of the congregation joining the new Carnoustie church in 1837. The [[Disruption of 1843]] led to a small [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] being set up at the East end of Barry, which was replaced by a larger building in 1888. The two churches united under the [[Church of Scotland]] in 1929, finally completing the move to the East site in the 1950s. All that remains of Barry Parish Church nowadays is the lower portion of its walls and the kirkyard.<ref name="barrychurch">[http://www.barryparish.org.uk/content.php?folder_id=5 Barry Church History], www.barryparish.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>

The first two churches in Carnoustie were built in 1810 by two rival branches of the [[United Secession Church|Secession Church]], which had split from the [[Church of Scotland|Established Church]] in 1733 over the issue of patronage. The [[Anti-Burgher]]s demolished the church they had built in 1789 near Grange of Barry Farm and rebuilt it, the 'Red Kirk', at Rye Park which was where Thistle Street now stands. The Burghers, built their church the same year in Kinloch Street. This church later went through a series of Unions with other churches, becoming part of the United Original Secession Church in 1822 and the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]] in 1852.<ref name="Dickson"/>

In 1837, the Established Church of Scotland built a church on the south side of Dundee street at the site on which now stands the Army and Air Cadets building. This congregation also split from the Established Church during the [[Disruption of 1843]] and became part of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church]]. When the Established Church claimed this building in 1850, the Free Church built another church, which later became known as St Stephen's church, immediately adjacent, on the site that was later used by Carnoustie Health Centre.<ref name="Dickson"/> Their Church Hall, The Philip Hall, is still in existence and is now used by Carnoustie Church<ref name="carnoustiechurch">[http://www.carnoustiechurch.org.uk/ Carnoustie Church], www.carnoustiechurch.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>. 

The current buildings of Panbride Church were built in 1851, on the site of the previous building. The site has been in use as a church since 1147 with a series of successive buildings being built there, the previous one being built in 1681. In 1854, the part of the congregation of Panbride Church that had joined the Free Church built what became Newton Church at Gallowlaw after several years of being housed in a wooden building on Westhaven Farm. The building was damaged by fire in 1887 and rebuilt to a larger design.<ref name="Dickson"/>

The [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] traces its history in Carnoustie to 1853 when it began meeting in an old Schoolhouse off Maule Street. It was formed into a congregation in 1877, which rapidly outgrew its premises, leading to the building of The Church of The Holyrood in 1881, the former building becoming the church hall. The church is part of the [[Diocese of Brechin (Episcopalian)|Diocese of Brechin]]<ref>[http://www.thedioceseofbrechin.org/ The Diocese of Brechin, Part of the Scottish Episcopal Church], www.thedioceseofbrechin.org; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>.

In 1873, the congregation of the Red Kirk, which had now become part of [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|The United Presbyterian Church]], again demolished their church and, in part, used the material to build The Erskine Church on the North side of Dundee Street. This, along with St Stevens Free Church and the Free Church in Kinloch Street, became part of the [[United Free Church of Scotland|United Free Church]] when the United Presbyterians and Free Church merged in 1900. On unification of the United Free Church with the Established Church in 1929, St Stephens and The Erskine Church's congregations merged, using St Stephen's as a home. The Erskine Church was sold, and since then has variously been a cinema, snooker club and pub. Those that did not agree with reunification with the Established Church formed a congregation as part of The United Free Church (Continuing), first finding a home in the YMCA building, later buying the Original Secession Church in Kinloch Street, where The Erskine United Free Church worship to this day.<ref>[http://www.ufcos.org.uk/direct5a.htm United Free Church of Scotland], www.ufcos.org.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>

Carnoustie Church built its new, larger church in 1902, opposite its former site. This building continues today to house the congregation of Carnoustie Church. The congregations of Carnoustie Church and St Stephen's merged in 1969, with St Stephen's being demolished to make way for the new Health Centre<ref name="carnoustiechurch"/>. In 2003, Carnoustie Church merged with Barry Church, and the congregation continues to meet at both churches.<ref name="barrychurch"/> In 1956, the congregations of Panbride Church and Newton Church united and continue to meet at both churches, Newton Church during Winter months and Panbride in the Summer<ref>[http://www.bicket.freeserve.co.uk/ Carnoustie Panbride Church, Church of Scotland], www.bicket.freeserve.co.uk; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>. 

The [[Roman Catholic Church in Scotland|Roman Catholic Church]] meets in the modern (built 2000) building of St Anne's Church in Thomas Street. This replaced the much smaller building the congregation had previously used in Dundee Street. The church is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dunkeld|Diocese of Dunkeld]].<ref>[http://www.dunkelddiocese.org.uk/parishes.htm Diocese of Dunkeld], www.dunkelddiocese.org.uk/parishes.htm; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>

The Carnoustie Christian Fellowship is an independent congregation meeting in a converted former Co-op building opposite the War Memorial.

The Churches all have their leaders appointed to the local Carnoustie Ministers' Council, which promotes joint Church events and has responsibility for the leadership of the town [[Boys' Brigade|Boys']] and [[Girls' Brigade]]s. The [[Scouts]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guides]] are also strongly supported by local congregations.

===Football===
Carnoustie is home to the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club [[Carnoustie Panmure F.C.]]. Formed in 1936, they are nicknamed the Gowfers due to the town's well-established links to the sport of golf ("gowf" in [[Scots language|Scots]]). They play at Laing Park, to which they moved in 2004, having previously played at Westfield Park.

The club received significant investment in the late 1990s, which has allowed them to emerge as one of the stronger Tayside clubs participating in the East Region. The pinnacle of their achievements was winning the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] in 2004<ref name="ersjfa">[http://www.ersjfa.com/ The official website of the Scottish Junior Football Association (East Region)], www.ersjfa.com; retrieved 1 September 2008</ref>.

The club currently plays in the Scottish Junior Football Association's East Region Premier League<ref name="ersjfa"/>.
