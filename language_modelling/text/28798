'''''Alv<U+00ED>ssm<U+00E1>l''''' ("Talk of Alv<U+00ED>ss") is poem collected in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' probably dating to the 11th century at the end of the Viking Age, that relates a conversation between [[Thor]] and a [[Dvergr]] (dwarf) called [[Alv<U+00ED>ss]] ("All-Wise").

==Plot==
Alv<U+00ED>ss comes to Thor to claim Thor's daughter as his bride. The daughter had apparently been promised to him earlier. Thor refuses, since he wasn't home when the deal was done. He says Alv<U+00ED>ss must answer any question Thor poses to win his daughter. The rest of the poem is mainly a list of comparative names for different entities among men, [[<U+00C6>sir]], [[Vanir]], [[J<U+00F6>tunn|giants]], [[Norse dwarves|dwarves]] and [[elf|elves]], which Alv<U+00ED>ss dashes off in reply to Thor's questions. These terms presumably describes the character of their users, although a common denominator cannot easily be discerned. For example, the [[sky]] has the following names, according to Alv<U+00ED>ss:

:''kalla Vind<U+00F3>fni vanir,''
:''Uppheim j<U+00F6>tnar,''
:''alfar Fagrar<U+00E6>fr,''
:''dvergar Drj<U+00FA>pansal.''

:''Heaven'' men call it,
:''The Height'' the gods,
:The Wanes ''The Weaver of Winds'';
:Giants ''The Up-World'',
:Elves ''The Fair-Roof'',
:The dwarfs ''The Dripping Hall''.

Alv<U+00ED>ss has the answer to every single one of Thor's questions, but he is nevertheless outwitted. When the sun finally rises at the end of the poem, Alv<U+00ED>ss, being a dwarf, turns to stone as its rays strike him. It is the only episode on record where Thor outthinks his adversary. He usually relied on brute force.

There is no action in the poem, and it stands entirely on its own, but it does contain words not found elsewhere, some doubtless the creation of its poet.
