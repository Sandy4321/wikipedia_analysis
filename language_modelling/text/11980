The '''2010<U+2013>11 [[The Ashes|Ashes series]]''' (known, for [[Sports marketing|sponsorship]] reasons, as the '''[[Vodafone]] Ashes Series''') is being played in Australia as part of the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2010<U+2013>11|England cricket team's tour of Australia]] during the 2010<U+2013>11 [[cricket]] season. Five [[Test cricket|Test]]s are scheduled to take place from 25 November 2010 to 7 January 2011.<ref name="bbc sport: Ashes Schedule">{{cite news |title=Australia reveal England's full Ashes tour schedule |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8499627.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=6 February 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Cricket Australia |url=http://www.cricket.com.au/default.aspx?s=3mobileashesseries2010-11 |title=3 Mobile Ashes Series 2010<U+2013>11}}</ref> England are the current holders of the urn, having won the most recent series in [[2009 Ashes series|2009]] by two Tests to one.

England are leading the series 2<U+2013>1 after 4 Tests and as current holders have therefore retained the Ashes with 1 Test to spare.

==Background==
Before the 2010<U+2013>11 Ashes series started, Australia had won 31 series to England's 29. The remaining five were draws. England won the most recent series in [[2009 Ashes series|2009]] by two Tests to one, but Australia had [[Whitewash (sport)|whitewashed]] the last one held on home soil (the [[2006<U+2013>07 Ashes series|2006<U+2013>07 series]]), winning 5<U+2013>0.  The last time England won the Ashes on Australian soil was in [[1986<U+2013>87 Ashes series|1986-87]].

Australia and England met in the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] final on 16 May. England won by seven wickets with three overs to spare. The two sides also played each other in England in June and July 2010 in a five-match [[One Day International|ODI]] [[Australian cricket team in England in 2010|series]] as a preview to the upcoming summer. England won the first three ODIs to claim the series, but the Australians won the last two.

The Australians remained in England to face [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], losing both [[Twenty20 International]]s and drawing a two-[[Test cricket|Test]] series 1<U+2013>1. England, meanwhile, beat [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] 2<U+2013>1 in a [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2010|3-match ODI series]] and beat Pakistan in a [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|controversial series]] <U+2013> 3<U+2013>1 in a four-match Test series, 2<U+2013>0 in two T20Is and 3<U+2013>2 in a five-match ODI series.

In the weeks leading up to the Ashes, Australia faced both [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in [[Australian cricket team in India in 2010<U+2013>11|India]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 2010<U+2013>11|Australia]] respectively. Australia played India in two [[Test cricket|Tests]] and three [[One Day International|ODIs]] during October. They lost both Tests, and lost the ODI series 1<U+2013>0, with the first and third games washed out without any cricket played. Sri Lanka faced the Australians during the early part of November with Sri Lanka winning the only Twenty20 International and winning the ODI series 2<U+2013>1.

Tickets for the Ashes series started selling on 25 July 2010, and within a week many Test days were sold out.<ref>[http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/sport/story/35726.html Ashes tickets selling fast] ESPN</ref>

Following an innings defeat, Australia made four changes, with pace bowlers Johnson and Hilfenhaus returning in place of Bollinger and Doherty, all-rounder [[Steve Smith (cricketer born 1989)|Steve Smith]] replacing North, and opener [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] replacing the injured Katich. Australia's bowling attack comprised four main pace bowlers and Smith as the premier spinner. England made one change, with [[Chris Tremlett]] chosen to replace the injured Broad.

On the first day, Tremlett marked his return to Test cricket with three top-order wickets as Australia were reduced to 69/5. However, the middle-lower order rescued Australia with [[Michael Hussey]], [[Brad Haddin]] and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] scoring half-centuries. Australia were finally bowled out for 268 runs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paine |first=Chris |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/12/16/3095317.htm?site=sport&section=cricket |title=England sets up WACA onslaught |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-16 }}</ref>

On the second day, England reached 78/0 before suffering a batting collapse with Johnson taking 6/38. In a spell costing just 7 runs, he accounted for Cook (32), Trott (4), Pietersen (0) and Collingwood (5) to leave England 98/5. Strauss and Bell made half-centuries before Johnson took two further wickets as England were all out for 187.

Starting their second innings with a lead of 81 runs, Australia lost Hughes, Ponting and Clarke cheaply before Hussey and Watson steadied the innings with a 113-run partnership. Watson fell five short of his century, but Hussey recorded his second century of the series before a late flurry of wickets left Australia being bowled out for 309. Hussey was last-man-out for 116 and that wicket completed Tremlett's maiden Test five wicket haul.

Needing 391 runs for victory, England quickly collapsed to 81/5. Johnson picked up two more wickets, and [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] collected his first since the opening over of the series as the openers and Pietersen fell cheaply. [[Ricky Ponting]] damaged a finger parrying Trott to wicket-keeper Haddin in the penultimate over, before [[Paul Collingwood]] was caught behind off Harris from the last ball of the day. On day four, the remaining England batsmen were quickly bowled out within ten overs. The final five wickets fell for just 42 runs with [[Ryan Harris (cricketer)|Ryan Harris]] taking 47/6. England were all out for 123, losing the game by 267 runs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paine |first=Chris |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/12/19/3096991.htm?site=sport&section=all |title=Australia draws level in Perth |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2010-12-19 }}</ref> For his 61 runs and 9/82 Johnson won the Man of the Match award.

Despite being the series' leading wicket-taker, [[Steven Finn (cricketer)|Steven Finn]] was rested by England for the much-anticipated [[Boxing Day Test]] and replaced by [[Tim Bresnan]]. [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] was cleared to play after a slight side strain. Australia were unchanged, with [[Ricky Ponting]] also cleared to play despite a fractured little finger on his left hand.<ref name="BBC Sport: Ponting finger">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/australia/9307642.stm |title=Ashes: Ricky Ponting to lead Australia in Melbourne |accessdate=27 December 2010 |work=BBC Sport }}</ref>

[[Andrew Strauss]] won the toss and elected to bowl. [[Shane Watson]] was dropped twice without scoring off Anderson before [[Chris Tremlett]] claimed his wicket. Tremlett later had Ponting caught behind before Anderson got the vital wicket of [[Michael Hussey]], who had achieved at least fifty in every innings of the series, in the last over before lunch. None of the Australian batsmen offered much resistance as they were bowled out for 98 before tea: their lowest Ashes total at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9311506.stm |title=Ashes: England dominate woeful Australia in Melbourne}}</ref> All ten dismissals were [[caught|catches]] with [[Matt Prior]] becoming the fourth English wicket-keeper to take six catches in an innings. Anderson and Tremlett took four wickets each while Bresnan took the remaining two.

In reply, England's openers advanced to 157/0 at the end of the first day's play before both fell early the following morning. Australia reviewed a caught-behind appeal for [[Kevin Pietersen]] when on 49, which upheld [[Aleem Dar|Aleem Dar's]] not out verdict; however Ponting continued to debate the decision with both umpires and was fined 40% of his match fee.<ref name="BBC Sport: 4th Test, Day 2">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9322256.stm |title=Ashes: Ricky Ponting fined by ICC after on-field row |accessdate=27 December 2010 |work=BBC Sport }}</ref> Pietersen was out soon after for 51 and was followed by Collingwood (8) and Bell (1). [[Matt Prior]] was then given out caught behind early in his innings, however Dar called for the third umpire for a suspected no ball. This was confirmed and Prior continued to support Trott, eventually making 85 while Trott achieved his fifth Test century and eventually finished not out on 168 as England were bowled out for 513.<ref name="BBC Sport: Trott Century">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9321914.stm |title=Ashes: Jonathan Trott century stretches England lead |accessdate=27 December 2010 |work=BBC Sport }}</ref> During the innings, [[Peter Siddle]] took a six-wicket haul while bowler [[Ryan Harris]] fractured his ankle in his run-up, placing his future in doubt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2010-11/content/current/story/494384.html|title=Stress fracture leaves Harris needing surgery|date=2010-12-28|work=ESPNcricinfo}}</ref>

By the time England were finally bowled out, Australia found themselves in a situation worse than at Adelaide: needing to make 415 runs just to make England bat again, and with eight sessions left to play. Australia got off to a quick start before [[Philip Hughes]] was run out off [[Graeme Swann|Graeme Swann's]] bowling. Tim Bresnan then took three wickets - Shane Watson [[leg before wicket|lbw]], captain Ricky Ponting [[bowled]] and Michael Hussey [[caught]] for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] - to leave Australia 104-4. Australia finished day 3 on 169-6, 246 runs behind and with Ryan Harris unable to bat after his ankle injury. An 86-run partnership on the fourth morning between Haddin and Siddle delayed the inevitable, but after Siddle was caught in the deep off Swann, Bresnan dismissed [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] for a pair to seal the match. Australia were bowled out for 258 and England retained the Ashes, winning by an innings and 157 runs.<ref name="Ashes4cricinfo">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2010-11/engine/current/match/428752.html | title=England tour of Australia, 4th Test: Australia v England at Melbourne, Dec 26-30, 2010| work=ESPNcricinfo }}</ref>
