The '''iPad''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|a<U+026A>|p|<U+00E6>|d}} {{respell|EYE|pad}}) is a line of [[tablet computer]]s designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The iPad runs Apple's [[iOS]] operating system. The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPads, the [[iPad (4th generation)]] and [[iPad Mini]], are expected to ship on November 2, 2012. The [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]] rather than a physical one. The iPad has [[Wi-Fi]] and cellular connectivity ([[2G]], [[3G]] and [[4G]] ([[iPad (3rd generation)|third]] and fourth generations and iPad Mini only)). 

An iPad can [[video camera|shoot video]], [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive email, and [[web browser|browse the web]]. Other functions&mdash;[[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[Social network service|social networking]], etc.&mdash;can be enabled by downloading [[application software|apps]]; {{as of|2012|lc=y}}, the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] offered more than 700,000 apps by Apple and third parties.<ref name="Apple <U+2013> iPhone 5 <U+2013> The best of everything.

Apple re-entered the mobile-computing markets in 2007 with the [[iPhone]]. Smaller than the iPad, but featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the [[multitouch]] finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's iOS mobile operating system.

On October 23, 2012, Apple announced [[iPad (4th generation)|the fourth generation]] of the iPad, expected to start shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an [[Apple A6|A6X]] processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning]] connector.

On October 23, 2012, Apple announced the [[iPad Mini]]. With a screen measuring 7.9 inches, it is aimed at the emerging sector of smaller tablets such as the [[Kindle Fire]]. The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the [[iPad 2]], with a 1024 by 768 pixel resolution screen, and with a dual core [[Apple A5|A5]] processor, but 53% lighter and 7.2mm thick. It is scheduled to be released on November 2, in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities. There are both WiFi and 4G versions, starting at $329 and $459 respectively.<ref name="appl_prelease_23-10-2012"/>

===Screen and input===
[[File:IPad in Black Case.jpg|thumb|The original iPad in its black case. For the iPad 2, Apple sells a Smart Cover rather than a case.]]
The iPad's (first two generations) [[touchscreen]] display is a 1,024 by 768 pixel, {{convert/2 |7.75|x|5.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[liquid crystal display]] (diagonal {{convert|9.7|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}), with [[Lipophobicity|fingerprint-]] and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be "too small to express the software" and that 10&nbsp;inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.<ref name="not-7-inch">{{cite news

The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] to sense iPad orientation and switch between [[Page orientation|portrait and landscape]] modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support [[screen rotation]] in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic "native" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/3640/apples-ipad-the-anandtech-review/4|title=Apple's iPad - The AnandTech Review|first=Anand|last= Lal Shimpi, Brian Klug & Vivek Gowri|publisher=AnandTech|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2012|page=4|quote=The display rotates smoothly to orient itself properly regardless of how you<U+2019>re holding it.}}</ref>

There are four physical switches on the iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: ''wake/sleep'' and ''volume up/down'', plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2010/03/12/ipads-mute-switch-replaced-with-screen-rotation-lock/|title=iPad's 'Mute' Switch Replaced With Screen Rotation Lock. |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |publisher=[[MacRumors]]}}</ref> In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" />

The original iPad had no camera; the iPad 2 has a front [[VGA]] camera and a rear-facing [[720p]] camera, both capable of still images (but these are only taken at a low quality 0.3 megapixels) and 30[[Frame rate|fps]] video. The rear-facing camera has a 5<U+00D7> [[digital zoom]] for still images only. Both shoot photo and video in a [[4:3]] fullscreen aspect ratio, unlike the [[iPhone 4]], which shoots in a [[16:9 aspect ratio|16:9]] widescreen aspect ratio. Unlike the iPhone, the iPad does not support tap to focus, but does allow you to tap to set auto exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4225/the-ipad-2-review/8|title=The Apple iPad 2 Review|first1=Brian |last1=Klug |first2=Anand Lal|last2=Shimpi |first3=Vivek |last3=Gowri|date=March 19, 2011|accessdate=July 29, 2012|quote=Tapping on the preview exposes for the tapped region, but since the rear camera is fixed focus, focus doesn<U+2019>t change.|publisher=AnandTech}}</ref> The cameras allow [[FaceTime]] video messaging with iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4, and [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]], [[Mac OS X Lion|Lion]], and [[OS X Mountain Lion|Mountain Lion]] [[Macintosh|Macs]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/02/technology/ipad_2_announcement/|title=IPad 2: Thinner, faster, and with a Steve Jobs surprise|first=David |last=Goldman|publisher=CNNMoney|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Audio and output===
The iPad has two internal speakers reproducing left and right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device,<ref name="ifixit-teardown-p3">{{cite web|title=Apple A4 Teardown|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad-Teardown/2183/3#s11201|first=Miroslav |last=Djuric |date=April 3, 2010|accessdate=April 17, 2010|work=iFixit}}</ref> while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill.<ref name="iPad 2 Wi-Fi Teardown" /> A volume switch is on the right side of the unit. A 3.5-mm [[TRRS connector]]<!--Yes, two Rs--> audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recording]].

The built-in [[Bluetooth 2.1|Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR]] interface allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be used with the iPad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/|title=iPad - Make your iPad even better with accessories|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref> However iOS does not currently support [[Bluetooth protocols#Object exchange (OBEX)|file transfer]] via Bluetooth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/ipads-lack-of-flashusbbluetooth-is-all-about-lock-in-updated/5922|title=iPad's lack of Flash/USB/Bluetooth is all about lock-in (updated)|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2010|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref> iPad also features 1024<U+00D7>768 VGA video output for limited applications,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4108|title=iPad: About iPad Dock Connector to VGA Adapter compatibility|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> screen capture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/image-capture/how-to-record-streaming-video-and-images-from-ipad/|title=How to Record Video and Images from iPad|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.

===Battery===
The iPad uses an internal [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[lithium-ion polymer]] (LiPo) battery. The batteries are made in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology.<ref name="forbes.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0607/best-under-billion-10-raymond-sung-simplo-technology-batteries-requried.html|work=Forbes|title=Best Under a Billion: Batteries Required?|date=June 7, 2010|accessdate=June 11, 2010|first=Joyce |last=Huang}}</ref> The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060|publisher=Apple|title=iPad: Charging the battery|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>

Apple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the [[iPod]] and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5492711/apple-will-replace-dead-battery-ipads-for-99|title=Apple will replace the dead battery of an iPad for $99|first=Kyle |last=VanHemert|date=March 13, 2010|accessdate=March 15, 2010 | work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]] }}</ref><ref name="Apple_iPad_Battery">{{cite web | url = http://www.apple.com/support/ipad/service/battery/ | title = iPad Battery Replacement Service: Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Apple | accessdate=March 14, 2010}}</ref> As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved.

Independent companies also provide a battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case.  Alternatively it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery, which may invalidate any remaining warranty on the iPad. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-troubleshooting-repair-faq/ipad-max-battery-life-charging-tips-battery-conservation.html |title=iPad Troubleshooting & Repair Q&A|publisher=Everyipod.com |date=December 8, 2011|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Storage and SIM===
[[File:64 GB iPad underside 1.JPG|thumb|The iPad model with data connectivity, unlike the Wi-Fi model, has a black plastic piece on the underside which allows cellular signals to pass through it.]]
The iPad was released with three capacity options for storage: 16, 32, or 64&nbsp;GB of internal [[flash memory]]. All data is stored on the internal flash memory, with no option to expand storage. Apple sells a "camera connection kit" with an [[SD card]] reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-ipad-camera-connection-kit/|title=Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit|first=Jeremy |last=Horwitz|publisher=[[iLounge]]|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2010}}</ref>

The side of the [[Wi-Fi]] + [[3G]] model has a [[Subscriber Identity Module#Card sizes|micro-SIM]] slot (not [[Subscriber Identity Module|mini-SIM]]).
The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible [[GSM]] carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold [[SIM lock|'locked' to specific carriers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/04/ipad-3g-wifi-day-is-today-heres-our-data-plan-primer/|title=iPad WiFi + 3G day is today; here's our data plan primer|work=[[Ars Technica]]|first=Chris |last=Foresman|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=June 11, 2010|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publishing|Cond<U+00E9> Nast Digital]]}}</ref> In the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network is limited to slower [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network uses different frequencies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Apple's iPad wireless service to be unlocked, partnered with AT&T |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/01/from_washington_the_most_inter.html |first=Cecilia |last=Kang |date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2010|work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Unlocked or Not, Your iPad Won't Be Able to Use T-Mobile's 3G Network |url=http://gizmodo.com/5458423/unlocked-or-not-your-ipad-wont-be-able-to-use-t+mobiles-3g-network |first= Rosa |last=Golijan |date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2010|work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}</ref> The [[iPad 2]] introduced a third tier of models with [[CDMA]] support for [[Verizon Wireless]] in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/03/live-coverage-apple-expected-to-unveil-new-ipad/1|title=Apple launching iPad 2 on March 11|first=Ed |last=Baig|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Accessories===
{{Main|iPad accessories}}
Apple offers several iPad accessories,<ref>{{cite web |title=iPad must-haves. And fun-to-haves |url=http://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/ |publisher=Apple |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin [[dock connector]], the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /> A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/03/25/schiller-no-ipad-2-keyboard-dock-use-the-soft-keyboard/|title=Schiller: No iPad 2 keyboard dock, use the soft keyboard|publisher=9 to 5 Mac|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with [[Macintosh|Macs]] and [[personal computer|PCs]]. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.

Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to [[USB]] Type A, the other an [[Secure Digital|SD]] card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB [[USB sound card|audio card]]
or [[MIDI keyboard]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4101 | title=iPad: Using the iPad Camera Connection Kit | accessdate=Nov 27, 2011 | publisher=Apple}}</ref>

Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.<ref name=SmartCoverTeardown>{{cite web|title=iPad 2 Smart Cover Teardown|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad-2-Smart-Cover-Teardown/5089/1|publisher=iFixit|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a [[microfiber]] bottom that cleans the front of the iPad, which wakes up when the cover is removed. There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.<ref name="Apple Smart Covers">{{cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/ipad/smart-cover/ | title=Apple <U+2013> Smart Cover | accessdate=March 12, 2011 | date=March 2, 2011 | publisher=apple.com}}</ref> In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the second and third generation iPads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405949,00.asp|work[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|first=Eugene |last=Kim|date=June 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012|title=Apple iPad Smart Case Review}}</ref>

|first=Jason |last=Snell|work=[[MacWorld]]|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Interface===
The [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.<ref name="home screen">{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title=Apple&nbsp;<U+2014> iPhone&nbsp;<U+2014> Features&nbsp;<U+2014> Home screen|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref>

Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to sixteen icons, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands [[multi-touch gestures|complex gestures using multi-touch]]. The iPad's [[interaction techniques]] enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]".

Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.

Other [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.

===Multimedia===
The layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]] or current [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] [[S60 platform|S60]] phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.

Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.

The iPad supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797|title=What is Gapless Playback?|accessdate=May 13, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.}}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPad can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.

The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].

===Internet connectivity===
The iPad can use Wi-Fi network [[trilateration]] from [[Skyhook Wireless]] to provide location information to applications such as [[Google Maps]]. The 3G model supports [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/apple-ipad-does-it-have-real-gps-updated-yes-and-no/5898|title=Apple iPad: Does it have <U+2018>real<U+2019> GPS? (updated: yes and no)|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 28, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref> The iPad has a [[TRS connector|headphone jack]] and a proprietary Apple [[dock connector]], but no [[Ethernet]] or USB port.<ref name="AppleIPadSpecs"/>
However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.

===Applications===
The iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, [[iTunes]], App Store, [[iBooks]], Maps, Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.<ref name="AppleIPadFeatures">{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ |title=iPad Features|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or [[Macintosh|Mac]].

==Restrictions==

===Digital rights management===
{{Details|iOS_(Apple)#Digital_rights_management{{!}}iOS|the digital rights management restrictions}}
The iPad does not employ [[DRM (computing)|Digital Rights Management]] but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to [[digital rights]] advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |title=Apple iPad will choke innovation, say open internet advocates|work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date=February 1, 2010 |first=Bobbie |last=Johnson |accessdate=February 7, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering|title=Apple's Trend Away From Tinkering|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=February 12, 2010|work=[[Slashdot]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all |title=All Your Apps Are Belong to Apple: The iPhone Developer Program License Agreement |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>

Digital rights advocates, including the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and computer engineer and activist [[Brewster Kahle]], have not criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with [[GigaOM]], was quoted by ''National Public Radio'' as saying, "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [the major media companies] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood, saying, "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [[Laura Sydell]], the article's author, concludes, "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125561844 |title=Apple's iPad: The End Of The Internet As We Know It? |date=April 5, 2010 |work=NPR |first=Laura |last=Sydell|authorlink=Laura Sydell |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

===Jailbreaking===
{{Details|iOS jailbreaking|iPad Jailbreaking}}
Like other iOS devices, the iPad can be "jailbroken", allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/ipad-jailbreak-ready-for-download/|title=iPad Jailbreak Ready for Download|work=Wired|publisher=Cond<U+00E9> Nast|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2010|first=Charlie |last=Sorrel}}</ref><ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak" /> Once it is jailbroken, users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as [[Cydia (application)|Cydia]], as well as illegally [[Software piracy|pirated]] applications.<ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak" /> Apple claims jailbreaking voids the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal.<ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak">{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5533921/how-to-jailbreak-any-iphone-ipod-touch-or-ipad|title=How To: Jailbreak Any iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad|date=May 8, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2010|first=John |last=Herrman|work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/201968/never_mind_legality_iphone_jailbreaking_voids_your_warranty.html|title=Never Mind Legality, iPhone Jailbreaking Voids Your Warranty|first=Daniel |last=Ionescu|work=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]]}}</ref> The iPad, released in April 2010, was first jailbroken in May 2010 with the [[Spirit (iOS jailbreak)|Spirit]] jailbreak for iOS version 3.1.2.<ref name="spirit-register">{{cite web |url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/03/ipad_jailbreak/ |title= Hackers release jailbreak for iPad and newer iPhones |first= Dan |last=Goodin |date= May 3, 2010 |publisher= The Register |accessdate=October 26, 2011 }}</ref> The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions 4.3 through 4.3.3 with the web-based tool [[JailbreakMe]] 3.0 (released in July 2011),<ref name="jailbreakme-informationweek">{{cite news |title=Apple iOS Zero-Day PDF Vulnerability Exposed |first= Mathew J. |last=Schwartz |url= http://www.informationweek.com/news/231001147 |newspaper= InformationWeek |date= July 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}</ref> and on iOS versions including 5.0 and 5.0.1 using [[redsn0w]]<ref name="howto-ios5">{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/242116/how_to_jailbreak_your_ios_5_device.html |title= How to Jailbreak Your iOS 5 Device |first= Sarah Jacobsson |last=Purewal |date= October 18, 2011 |publisher= [[IDG]] |work=PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] |accessdate=October 23, 2011 }}</ref> Absinthe 2.0 was released on May 25, 2012 as the first jailbreak method for all iOS 5.1.1 devices except the 32&nbsp;nm version of the iPad 2.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/25/absinthe-2-0-jailbreak/ | title=Absinthe 2.0 hits the download wire, jailbreaks all iOS 5.1.1 devices but the 32nm iPad 2 | work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]] | date=May 25, 2012 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | first=Zach |last=Honig}}</ref>

===Censorship===
Apple's App Store, which provides iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. ''The Guardian'' newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor [[WH Smith]], which for many years imposed content restrictions.<ref name="Schofield">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/may/10/ipad-apple|title=Wikipedia's porn purge, and cleaning up for the iPad|first=Jack |last=Schofield|date=May 10, 2010|work=The Guardian  |location=UK|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

Due to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store, [[YouPorn]] and others changed their video format from [[Adobe Flash#Flash Video|Flash]] to [[H.264]] and [[HTML5]] specifically for the iPad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/24/ipad-porn-private/|

===Reaction to the announcement===
Media reaction to the iPad announcement was mixed. [[Walter Mossberg|Walt Mossberg]] wrote, "It's about the software, stupid", meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad's success than software and user interface, his first impressions of which were largely positive. Mossberg also called the price "modest" for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://allthingsd.com/20100127/apple-ipad-impressions/ | title = First Impressions of the New Apple iPad | first=Walter S. |last=Mossberg | authorlink = Walter Mossberg | work=[[All Things Digital]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] | date = January 27, 2010 | accessdate =January 27, 2010 }}</ref> Others, including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating [[netbook]]s, most of which use [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/gadget/3211316/apple-ipad-versus-netbook-features-compared/|title=Apple iPad versus netbook: features compared |first=Eric |last=Lai |work=PC Advisor |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/ipad-vs-the-kindle-tablets-and-netbooks-20100202-n9jf.html|title=iPad vs the Kindle, tablets and netbooks |first=Simon |last=Tsang |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}</ref> The base model's $499 price was lower than pre-release estimates by the tech press, Wall Street analysts, and Apple's competitors, all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point.<ref name="FastCompany-price">{{cite web|title=The iPad's Biggest Innovation: Its $500 Price|url= http://www.fastcompany.com/article/apples-tablet-introduced?page=0%2C0|first=Kit |last=Eaton|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2010|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}</ref><ref name="WSJ Price">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094304575029621430370074.html|title=Apple's iPad Revolution: Price |first=Martin |last=Peers|date=January 28, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="AT price">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/01/tablet-makers-rethinking-things-in-wake-of-ipads-low-price/|title=Tablet makers rethinking things in wake of iPad's $499 price|first=Jon |last=Stokes|date=January 29, 2010|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publishing|Cond<U+00E9> Nast Digital]]|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref>

CNET also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft's [[Zune]] have had for a number of years. The built-in iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13526_3-10444796-27.html|title=How to make the iPad a better music device|first=Matt |last=Rosoff|work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 30, 2010|accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

Reviews of the iPad have been generally favorable.

A survey by [[Frost & Sullivan]] shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity, reduced paperwork, and increased revenue. The research firm estimates that "The mobile-office application market in North America may reach $6.85&nbsp;billion in 2015, up from an estimated $1.76&nbsp;billion [in 2010]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2010-11-02/microstrategys-corporate-apps-boost-productivitybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |title=MicroStrategy's Corporate Apps Boost Productivity |date=November 1, 2010 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |quote=About 42% of respondents in the survey, which was released in August, sought an increase in user productivity, followed by reduced paperwork (39%), and increased revenue (37%).

Since March 2011, the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] has approved the iPad for in-cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kate |last=Murphy|title=The Paperless Cockpit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/business/05pilots.html|accessdate=July 7, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=July 4, 2011}}</ref>
In 2011, [[Alaska Airlines]] became the first airline to replace pilots' paper manuals with iPads, weighing 0.68&nbsp;kg compared to 11&nbsp;kg for the printed flight manuals. It hopes to have fewer back and muscle injuries.<ref name="theage.com.au">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/airline-to-replace-pilot-manuals-with-ipads-20110602-1fhxu.html |title=Alaska Airlines to replace pilot manuals with iPads |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen airlines have followed suit, including United, which has distributed 11,000 iPads to cockpits.<ref>{{cite news|title=United puts iPads in cockpits for 'paperless flight deck'|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1161884/ipads_in_cockpit.html|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> Also, many airlines now offer their inflight magazine as a downloadable application for the iPad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lufthansa.com/us/en/Lufthansa-Magazin|title=Lufthansa Magazin iPad|accessdate=August 9, 2012|publisher=Lufthansa}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/united-airlines-hemispheres/id462829744?mt=8|title=United Airlines Hemispheres Magazine|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/australian-way/global/en/|title=Inflight Magazine - The Australian Way|publisher=Qantas|quote=Now on iPad|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Education and healthcare===
The iPad has several uses in the classroom,<ref name="classroom">[http://www.teleread.com/ipad/teaching-with-the-ipad-first-days Teleread.com: Teaching with the iPad]. Retrieved October 1, 2010.</ref> and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling.<ref name="homeschool2">{{cite web|url=http://spottybanana.com/2010/04/13/ipad-in-the-homeschool|publisher=Spotty Banana|title=iPad in the Homeschool|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name="homeschool3">{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/01/how-will-the-apple-tablet-change-our-kids-lives|title=How Will the Apple iPad Change Our Kids' Lives?|publisher=Wired|accessdate=October 1, 2010|first=Jenny |last=Williams|date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Soon after the iPad was released, it was reported that 81% of the top book apps were for children.<ref name="children">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/04/27/for-ipad-81-percent-of-top-book-apps-are-kids-titles/|title=81 Percent of Top Book Apps Are Kids Titles|publisher=AOL News|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref> The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily.<ref name="autism">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-08-11/news/ihelp-for-autism/|title=iHelp for Autism|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|date=October 1, 2010|first=Ashley |last=Harrell|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

In the healthcare field, iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their [[Supply chain management|supply chain]]. For example, Novation, a healthcare contracting services company, developed VHA PriceLynx (based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor MicroStrategy), a [[business intelligence]] app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals. Guillermo Ramas of Novation states, "Doctors won't walk around a hospital with a laptop. With an iPad it's perfect to walk around the hospital with as long as they have the information they need."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Health-Care-IT/MicroStrategy-App-for-iPhone-iPad-Helps-Hospitals-Manage-Supply-Chain-424068/ |title=Novation App for iPhone, iPad Helps Hospitals Manage Supply Chain |date=August 22, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Horowitz|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>

===Consumer usage===
During the 2010 [[Major League Baseball]] free agent season, the agent for the player [[Carl Crawford]] was sending iPads to prospective teams interested in Mr. Crawford. These iPads were pre-loaded with video clips highlighting his player, and how it would benefit their team to have him.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Topkin |url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/baseball/rays/arbitration-nontender-decisions-to-come-this-week-for-tampa-bay-rays/1136877 |title=Rays Rumblings |publisher=tampabay.com |date=November 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

In the United States fans attending [[Super Bowl XLV]], the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released, could use an official [[National Football League]] (NFL) app to navigate [[Cowboys Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Erik |last=Malinowski|title=Cowboys Stadium Techs Up for Super Bowl Close-Up|url=http://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/02/super-bowl-nerve-center/|publisher=Wired|accessdate=May 4, 2011|date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> In 2011, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks, and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an [[iPad 2]].<ref>{{cite news

The iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software. These include sound samplers, guitar and voice effects processors, sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops, virtual synthesizers and drum machines, theremin-style and other touch responsive instruments, drum pads and many more. [[Gorillaz]]'s 2010 album, ''[[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]]'', was created almost exclusively using the iPad by [[Damon Albarn]] while on tour with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11968925|title=Gorillaz are to release a free album on Christmas Day|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Newsbeat|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}</ref>

The iPad has also greatly increased [[Social television]] use. Viewers can use the iPad as a convenient second networked computer (or "[[second screen]]") for communicating with other viewers or with the television provider. Viewers can use a web browser or specialised applications to discuss a program with other viewers, while it is being broadcast, while content providers may use the [[second screen]] to interact with viewers in real time. The latter facility allows content providers to conduct (e.g.) real-time polls or to collect comments about the program, that can be displayed as text on the main television screen. Viewer interaction via a [[second screen]] is becoming increasingly popular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/second-screen-apps-explode-132237|title=Second Screen Apps Explode|publisher=Adweek|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref>
