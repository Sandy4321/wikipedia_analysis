'''State Highway 90''' is a {{convert|41.9|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} long [[state highway]] at the western edge of [[Colorado]].  
==Route description==
SH 90 begins in the west at the border with Utah where it becomes [[Utah State Route 46]] which continues westward to meet [[U.S. Highway 191]] about twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) south of [[Moab, Utah|Moab, UT]].  From the Utah border the road passes eastward for about {{convert|34|mi|km}} through a very remote area, first along a section of [[La Sal Creek]], then over a pass and though [[Paradox Valley]], where it crosses the [[Dolores River Bridge]] near the town of [[Bedrock, Colorado|Bedrock]]. After leaving the valley, it joins up with [[Colorado State Highway 141|State Highway 141]] at [[Vancorum, Colorado|Vancorum]] where this portion of the road ends.  The road then reappears approximately eight miles west of [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]] and travels into downtown Montrose where its western end occurs at its intersection with [[U.S. Highway 550 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 550]].  The two sections of the road are joined by a {{convert|49|mi|km|adj=on}} section composed mostly of unpaved road and a brief stretch of SH 141 neither of which are officially part of SH 90.  Thus the official length of the road is {{convert|41.9|mi|km}}, but driving from one end to the other will require traveling at least {{convert|89|mi|km}}.  If only paved routes are used, that distance increases considerably.
==History==
The route was established in the 1920s without the current gap. In 1954, all was cut out except the current eastern section, and the current western section was added back in 1963. The route was also entirely paved by 1963.<ref name="mesalek">{{cite web|url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/r80-99.html#90|title=Colorado Routes 80-99|author=Salek, Matthew E.|accessdate=04-11-2010}}</ref>
==Major intersections==
The entire route is located in [[Montrose County, Colorado]].
