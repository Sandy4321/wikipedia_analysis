The '''76th Boat Race''' took place on 5 April 1924.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Oxford were reigning champions having won the previous year's race and their crew was significantly heavier than their opponents for this year's race.  Umpired by former rower [[Frederick I. Pitman]], Cambridge won by four-and-a-half lengths in a time of 18 minutes 41 seconds, the fastest time since 1911. The victory took the overall record in the event to 40&ndash;35 in Oxford's favour.

Oxford were coached by G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the [[The Boat Race 1882|1882]] and [[The Boat Race 1883|1883 races]], [[Harcourt Gilbey Gold]] (Dark Blue president for the [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 race]] and four-time Blue) and E. D. Horsfall (who had rowed in the three races prior to the [[First World War]]).  Cambridge's coaches were Francis Escombe, P. Haig-Thomas (four-time Blue who had rowed between 1902 and 1905) and David Alexander Wauchope (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1895|1895 race]]).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref> For the sixteenth year the umpire was [[Eton College|Old Etonian]] [[Frederick I. Pitman]] who rowed for Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1884|1884]], [[The Boat Race 1885|1885]] and [[The Boat Race 1886|1886 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 108</ref>

Cambridge had few former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] to call upon and despite measles striking at least one of the crew down, their rowing style was described by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater as "harmoniously together".<ref name=drink142>Drinkwater, p. 142</ref>  Conversely, Oxford's crew was experienced yet a "lack of uniformity" in early training evolved into a crew with "a turn of such extraordinary speed that being was as much as four to one on Oxford".<ref name=drink142/>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 5.5&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (78.5&nbsp;kg), {{convert|5.875|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge saw a single rower return with Boat Race experience in their number six T. D. A. Collet.  Conversely, Oxford's crew included six individuals who had represented the Dark Blues in the event, including [[Bow (rowing)|bow]] P. C. Mallam who was making his fourth consecutive appearance.<ref name=burn72>Burnell, p. 72</ref>  Oxford's American [[Stroke (rowing)|stroke]] W. P. Mellen was the only non-British participant registered in the event, having been educated at the [[Middlesex School]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn72/>  Umpire Pitman started the race in bright sunshine and a light breeze at 2:23&nbsp;p.m.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 141&ndash;142</ref>  Oxford took a brief lead, [[stroke rate|out-rating]] their opponents significantly in the first minute, but by the time the crews passed the Mile Post, the Light Blues were nearly a quarter of a length ahead.  As both boats passed under [[Hammersmith Bridge]], Cambridge had extended their lead and were clear of Oxford, despite rowing two strokes per minute slower.<ref name=drink143/>

Even though the Dark Blues made a spurt, Cambridge pulled away and were three lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps.  According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, "from here they had it all their own way to the finish".<ref name=drink143>Drinkwater, p. 143</ref>  Cambridge passed the finishing post four and a half lengths ahead, in a time of 18 minutes 41 seconds, the fastest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1911|1911 race]] and the second fastest time in the history of the event.  It was their fourth win in five years and took the overall record in the event to 40&ndash;35 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
