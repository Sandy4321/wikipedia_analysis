'''Crush 40''' is a [[Japanese American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band originally known as '''Sons of Angels''' that was made to create music for the [[Sega]] arcade racing game ''[[NASCAR Arcade]]'' (also known as ''NASCAR Rubbin'Rainbows Racing'' outside of America). The core of the group is the hard rock guitarist and video game composer [[Jun Senoue]] and vocalist [[Johnny Gioeli]], who is also the vocalist for the bands [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]] and [[Axel Rudi Pell]]. Due to the reunion of the Norwegian band Sons of Angels, the band changed its name to Crush 40, and released its second album under this name.  

Since forming, Crush 40 has released two studio albums, ''Thrill of the Feel'' and ''Crush 40''. The band has also contributed music to game soundtracks for [[Wave Master|Wave Master Entertainment]], including the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series.  Most of the band's contributions are songs for the various games in this series.  

==History==
===Formation and ''Thrill of the Feel''===
Crush 40's origin began with guitarist [[Jun Senoue]] and his employment with [[Sega]]. After graduating from college in 1993, Jun Senoue was employed by Sega to be a music composer for video games. His first project was creating two songs for ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]''.<ref name="list">{{cite web | url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/13/19/| title=Style Factory interview with Jun Senoue| accessdate=2008-01-27|publisher=junsenoue.com}}</ref>  Later, he worked on other games such as ''[[Dark Wizard]]'', ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' ([[Sega Mega Drive]] version), ''[[Sega Rally 2]]'', and ''[[Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition]]''.<ref name="list">{{cite web | url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/13/19/| title=Style Factory interview with Jun Senoue| accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref>

In 1998, Senoue contacted the singer from [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]], [[Johnny Gioeli]], and recorded their first song as a group, [[Open Your Heart]].<ref name="js1"/>  After making the track, which would later be on the video game ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', the two stayed in contact. Eventually from this relationship spawned a project band to make the soundtrack for another game Senoue worked on, ''[[NASCAR Arcade]]''.<ref name="crush40"/> The band was formed under the name "Sons of Angels", the same as a song that Senoue performed with [[Eric Martin (singer)|Eric Martin]] on the ''Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition'' soundtrack.<ref name="js1">{{cite web | url=http://www.junsenoue.com/content/view/2/10/| title=Jun Senoue's Biography| accessdate=2008-01-09 |author= Parminder Gill|date=2005-04-10|publisher=junsenoue.com}}</ref>

The original band included Senoue as the guitarist, Gioeli singing, and Naoto Shibata and Hirotsugu Homma from [[Anthem]] playing the bass and drums, respectively.<ref name="crush40"/> In 2000, the band released their album ''Thrill of the Feel'' through [[Victor Entertainment]].<ref name="crush40"/><ref name="jvc">{{cite web|url=http://www.jvcmusic.co.jp/-/Discography/A014575/VICP-61014.html|title=JVC Music/Victor Album Information: Thrill of the Feel||language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-04-10|publisher=jvcmusic.co.jp}}</ref> The album contained all of the tracks which they had written for ''NASCAR Arcade''.<ref name="crush40">{{cite web | url=http://www.junsenoue.com/content/view/1/14| title=Crush 40 History| accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref>

===Several changes and ''Crush 40''===
The band resurfaced during the development of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. Naoto Shibata and Hirotsugu Homma could not take part because they were performing with Loudness and later [[Anthem (band)|Anthem]], so Katsuji and Takeshi Taneda were brought in to play the songs for the game. The resulting track was "Live and Learn", the main theme of Sonic Adventure 2.<ref name="crush40"/> 

When the Norwegian band "Sons of Angels" reunited under this alias that they had before, Gioeli and Senoue decided to change their band's name to Crush 40.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://digilander.libero.it/aorwebsite/jan03.htm| title=Review of "Crush 40"| accessdate=2008-01-12|author=Andrea Bertamino|date=2003-01-31|publisher=digilander.libero.it}}</ref> When Senoue was asked why he picked "Crush 40" as the name, he responded, "When we had to find another good one, we picked up the word we like<U+2026><U+201C>Crush<U+201D> is one of them, and Johnny added the number on it. Crush is the name of the soda too<U+2026>that's my favorite!"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/10/19/| title=MelodicRock.com interview with Jun Senoue| accessdate=2008-01-13|author=Parminder Gill|date=2004-02-07|publisher=junsenoue.com}}</ref>

Two years after the release of ''Sonic Adventure 2'', the album ''Crush 40'', a European cover version of "Thrill of the Feel", was released by [[Frontiers Records]].<ref name="c40">{{cite web | url=http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=601| title=RevelationZ's article on Crush 40| accessdate=2008-03-05|author=Michael|date=2003-02-23|publisher=revelationz.net}}</ref>  The album contained the same music as their previous album with the same racing theme of the songs written for NASCAR Arcade,<ref name="c40"/> but without the previous album's instrumental tracks.  Senoue claimed that Crush 40 was the project of himself and Gioeli, which is why the instrumental tracks were removed.<ref name="faq">{{cite web|url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/5/11/|title=Frequently Asked Questions to Jun Senoue|author=Parminder Gill|date=2004-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=junsenoue.com}}</ref>  There were, however, both prior Sonic theme songs "Open Your Heart" and "Live and Learn", as well as two bonus tracks: "It Doesn't Matter" featuring vocalist [[Tony Harnell]], and "Escape from the City" featuring [[Ted Poley]] and Tony Harnell.<ref name="crush40"/>  Senoue's rationale for including these two songs was that he wanted to introduce some of his favorite songs featuring other singers to the fans.<ref name="faq"/>

===Continued work with Sega===
Crush 40 has not released any albums since 2003. However, the band has performed original music for several video games. The songs the band performed for these games were released on the soundtracks of each game, under Sega's [[Wave Master|Wave Master Entertainment]] label.<ref name="tt">{{cite web | url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=WWCE-31020| title=Disc Information: ''Triple Threat Sonic Heroes Vocal Trax''|author=Lucy Rzeminski| accessdate=2008-04-08|publisher=chudahs-corner.com}}</ref><ref name="sh">{{cite web | url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=WWCE-31114| title=Disc Information: ''Shadow the Hedgehog Vocal Trax''|author=Lucy Rzeminski| accessdate=2008-04-08|publisher=chudahs-corner.com}}</ref><ref name="sw">{{cite web | url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=WWCE-31142| title=Disc Information: ''Sonic the Hedgehog Vocal Traxx Several Wills''|author=Lucy Rzeminski| accessdate=2008-04-08|publisher=chudahs-corner.com}}</ref>

In 2003, Sega announced the first [[multiplatform]] [[Sonic]] game, ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', which featured two new Crush 40 songs: the theme tune "Sonic Heroes", a "bright, melodic song", and "What I'm Made Of...", a "distinctly dark hard rock song with metal sensibilities".<ref name="crush40"/>  The music itself was also released on the ''[[Sonic Heroes (soundtrack)| Triple Threat: Sonic Heroes Vocal Trax]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="tt"/> In the booklet for ''Triple Threat: Sonic Heroes Vocal Trax'', Katsuji is credited as the drummer for "Sonic Heroes", but Mark Schulman is credited as the drummer for "What I'm Made Of..."<ref>{{cite book|title=''[[Sonic Heroes (soundtrack)|Triple Threat: Sonic Heroes Vocal Trax]]'' booklet|publisher=[[Wave Master|Wave Master Entertainment]]|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=''[[Sonic Heroes (soundtrack)|Triple Threat: Sonic Heroes Vocal Trax]]'' booklet|publisher=[[Wave Master|Wave Master Entertainment]]|page=8}}</ref> 

When Sega announced ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' in 2005, Crush 40 returned to perform the game's theme song, "I Am... All of Me". There is a second song by Crush 40 in the game, the ending theme named "Never Turn Back". Both of these songs also appear on the soundtrack called ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)#Music|Lost and Found: Shadow the Hedgehog Vocal Trax]]''. For Crush 40's contributions to this soundtrack, the drumming duties were passed on to Toru Kawamura.<ref name="sh"/>

Crush 40 also made contributions to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2006]]''. The band created its own rendition of "All Hail Shadow", previously performed by [[Magna-Fi]] in the game ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]''. Crush 40 also recorded a version of "[[His World]]", the main theme of ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' in 2006.  The latter of these two did not appear in the game, but both of these songs are on this game's soundtrack, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog Vocal Traxx: Several Wills]]''. Kawamura was also the drummer for this soundtrack.<ref name="sw"/>

The band also contributed several of its songs, including "Live and Learn", to the video game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''.<ref name="ssbb">{{cite web | url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music19.html| title=Smash Bros. Dojo Music Update 19| accessdate=2008-01-22|author=Masahiro Sakurai|date=2007-12-25|publisher=smashbros.com}}</ref> The song was also featured in an episode of  the Japanese version of [[Sonic X]]. 

In 2008, the album ''[[True Blue: The Best of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' was released in Japan, and featured Crush 40's cover of the ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' theme "Seven Rings in Hand", originally performed by [[Steve Conte]].  Also included on the album are Crush 40 songs "Live and Learn" (2007 Remastered Version)", "What I'm Made Of..." (2007 Remastered Version), "Sonic Heroes", two versions of "Open Your Heart", two versions of "It Doesn't Matter" (with Tony Harnell), and "Escape from the City" (with Ted Poley and Tony Harnell).<ref name="tb">{{cite web | url=http://www.sonicstadium.org/sonicnews/405| title=Sonic Stadium's Track List for ''True Blue''| accessdate=2008-01-24|author=Dale Gennard|date=2008-01-18|publisher=sonicstadium.org}}</ref> The band record several songs for ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]'', including the game's main theme, ''Knight of the Wind''.

Jun Senoue recently announced on his official site's message board that Crush 40 is currently working on two future album releases, one being the sequel to their self-titled album which will feature all original tracks (not Sonic/videogame related) and the other being a compilation album of their best work, tentatively titled "Crush 40 : Works 1998-2008".  The latter will feature mostly Sonic The Hedgehog related music.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://junsenoue.com/component/option,com_fireboard/Itemid,38/func,view/id,14615/catid,6/| title=My answers to your questions...| accessdate=2009-05-11 |author= Jun Senoue|date=2008-08-25|publisher=Junsenoue.com}}</ref>
	
On [[October 12]] [[2008]], [[Jun Senoue]] and [[Johnny Gioeli]] performed a live concert at the [[Tokyo Game Show]]. The songs they performed included shortened versions of "I Am... All Of Me", "His World", "Sonic Heroes", "What I'm Made of" and the full version of "Live and Learn". Crush 40 also performed a shortened version of "Knight of the Wind". A live recording of this concert has been uploaded on Youtube and is linked from the Crush 40's website. This marked Crush 40's first live appearance with singer [[Johnny Gioeli]].{{Fact|date=November 2008}}

In a review of their self-titled album, the band's style was referred to as "melodic hard rock, somewhere between [[XYZ (metal band)|XYZ]] and [[Burning Rain]]" by Bj<U+00F8>rnar Bevolden of ProgressiveWorld.net.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.progressiveworld.net/crush40.html| title=ProgressiveWorld's article on the album ''Crush 40''| accessdate=2008-01-12|author=Bj<U+00F8>rnar Bevolden|date=2003-04-01|publisher=progressiveworld.net}}</ref> Among the songs of this album is "Live and Learn", a "cool in your face rocker", according to Michael of RevelationZ Magazine.<ref name="c40"/>  However, Crush 40 has also experimented with other forms of [[rock music]].  For example, "What I'm Made Of..." is a darker song with elements similar to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="crush40"/>

When interviewed about his style and that of the band, Jun Senoue said, "I know what my style is, and I know what my favourite genres of music are. I listen to a lot of metal music, as well as other genres of music, and my inspiration is always there. The style of the music in the game does change, and it gives a great sense of progression... When we got together to write stuff for Shadow, we found that our fresh ideas were a lot different to the songs we<U+2019>d written back in 2002 <U+2013> our sound had changed."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://junsenoue.com/content/view/114/19/ | title=Q&A with Jun Senoue Part 1| accessdate=2006-08-14|author=Adam Tuff|date=2006-08-14|publisher=junsenoue.com}}</ref>
