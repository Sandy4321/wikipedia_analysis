The '''Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill''' occurred in [[New Mexico]], USA, in 1979 when [[United Nuclear Corporation]]'s [[Church Rock, New Mexico|Church Rock]] uranium mill tailings disposal pond breached its dam. Over 1,000 tons of [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and millions of  gallons of mine effluent flowed into the [[Puerco River]]. Local residents used river water for irrigation and livestock and were not immediately aware of the toxic danger.  In terms of the amount of radiation released the accident was comparable in magnitude to the [[Three Mile Island accident]] of the same year and has been reported as the largest [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|radioactive accident]] in U.S. History. 

==The Spill==
On July 16, 1979, United Nuclear Corporation's [[Church Rock, New Mexico|Church Rock]] uranium mill tailings disposal pond breached its dam and 1100 tons of [[radioactive waste|radioactive mill waste]] and approximately 93 million gallons of mine effluent flowed into the [[Puerco River]].<ref name=epa2>[http://www.epa.gov/region6/6sf/newmexico/united_nuclear/nm_united_nuclear_2nd-5yr_review.pdf Second Five-Year Review Report for the.

The flood backed up sewers, affected nearby aquifers and left stagnating pools on the riverside.<ref name=chur>Doug Brugge, PhD, MS, Jamie L. deLemos, MS and Cat Bui, BS, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1963288/ The Sequoyah Corporation Fuels Release and the Church Rock Spill: Unpublicicized Nuclear Releases in American Indian Communities] ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', September 2007, Vol 97, No. 9, pp. 1595-1600, doi:10.2105/AJPH.2006.103044 [http://www.sric.org/Churchrock/SFCChurchRockAJPH2007.pdf PDF version]</ref><ref name=water>Brendan Giusti, Radiation Spill in Church Rock Still Haunts 30 Years Later, ''The Daily Times'' ([[Farmington, New Mexico]]), July 16, 2009,  Section: Local</ref><ref name=sz>Ferenc Morton Szasz, ''Larger Than Life: New Mexico in the Twentieth Century'', UNM Press, 2006, pp.82-83, ISBN 0826338836</ref>

The 50&nbsp;ft. earthen dam was recognized as built on geologically unsound land by the corporation's consultant and federal agencies. By 1977 cracks had appeared in the dam and went unreported to authorities.<ref name=chur/> According to Paul Robinson, research director at the [[Southwest Research and Information Center]], the spill resulted from "poor oversight, poor siting and poor construction" and is an example of the problems that can occur at [[uranium mine]]s and mills.<ref name=water/>

==Radiation release==
In terms of the amount of radiation released the accident was comparable in magnitude to the [[Three Mile Island accident]] of the same year<ref name=chur/> and has been reported as "the largest [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|radioactive accident]] in U.S. History".<ref name=water/> Shortly after the breach below the dam radiation levels of river water were 7000 times that of the allowable level of drinking water.<ref>Bruce E.

Although steps were taken at the time of the accident to notify the public in accordance with a state contingency plan,<ref name=chur/> local residents were not immediately aware of the toxic danger and were accustomed to using the riverside for recreation and herb gathering. Residents wading in the water went to the hospital complaining of burning feet and were diagnosed with heat stroke. Livestock were also found dying.<ref name=water/> Prior to the accident local residents used river water for irrigation and livestock. The eventual assistance of trucked in water ended in 1981 and farmers were then left with little choice other than to resume use of the river.<ref>Chris Shuey, MPH [http://www.sric.org/workbook/features/V11_1.html The Puerco River: Where Did the Water Go?] ''Southwest Research and Information Center'', 1986</ref>

==Clean up==
Clean up was performed by state and federal criteria.<ref name=epa2/> About 3,500 barrels of waste materials were retrieved (estimated at only 1%).<ref name=chur/> However, according Robinson, only a "very little of the spilled liquid was pumped out of the water supply".<ref name=water/> The uranium mill site closed in 1982 related to a declining uranium market. In 1983 the site entered the [[National Priorities List]] of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Superfund]] investigations and clean up efforts because [[radionuclides]] and chemical constituents were recognized as entering local ground water.<ref name=epa2 /> In 1994 the EPA extended its efforts with a study of all known uranium mines on the [[Navajo Nation]].<ref>[http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/7508188dd3c99a2a8825742600743735/26fbc51aac6a659888257007005e9416!OpenDocument Abandoned Uranium Mines On The Navajo Nation] EPA Region 9: Superfund, retrieved July 30 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.epa.gov/region09/superfund/navajo-nation/index.html Addressing Uranium Contamination in the Navajo Nation] Superfund - Region 9, EPA</ref>
