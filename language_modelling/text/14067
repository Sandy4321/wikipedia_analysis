'''Vincent Peter "Vinnie" Jones''' (born 5 January 1965) is an [[England|English]] ex-[[Association football|footballer]] and [[film actor]].

As a member of the "[[Crazy Gang]]", Jones won the [[1988 FA Cup Final]] with [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. Jones represented and captained the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national team]] having qualified via a Welsh grandparent. He also previously played for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leeds United]].

He has capitalised on his tough man image as a footballer and is now known as an actor for his aggressive style and intimidating demeanour.

== Biography ==
=== Football career ===
Vinnie Jones was born in Watford to a Peter Jones (a [[gamekeeper]]) and Glenda Harris Jones.<ref>[http://www.tv-now.com/stars/vinjonestv-now biography]</ref> He started his football career in 1984 at [[Conference National|Alliance Premier League]] side [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], during which time he combined playing football with being a [[hod carrier]].<ref name="MOTD magazine">{{Citation

</ref>

Later that year he moved to [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] for a <U+00A3>10,000 fee. He was part of the '[[Crazy Gang]]' team that won the [[1988 FA Cup Final]] against Liverpool, arguably the club's greatest achievement.  He subsequently played for [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], where he was part of a young side under the management of [[Howard Wilkinson]]. During his time there, he won promotion to the old Division one from the second division. After helping them win promotion to the top-flight as Champions of Division Two, Jones proved that he could thrive without the illegal side of his game, and under the stewardship of Wilkinson, he received only three yellow cards in the whole season.

Jones left Leeds after losing his first team place to [[David Batty]] and [[Gary Speed]], much to the disappointment of the Leeds fans, in order to seek regular first team football. To this day, he remains a hugely popular figure with the Leeds fans, Vinnie also has a Leeds United badge tattoo on his leg (after having helped them to the 1989/90 second division championship)<ref>[http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-jones_vinnie.htm Vinnie Jones' Tattoos]</ref>. Jones also showed his passion for the club when he returned to Leeds for [[Lucas Radebe]]'s testimonial in 2006. Vinnie also played for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], before moving back to Wimbledon again in 1992 where he played over 250 games, before briefly becoming [[player/manager]] of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in 1998. When overlooked for the vacant post of manager of QPR, he announced he would move to Manchester United.

During his playing days, he was renowned for his "hard man" image, an aspect of his play that was frequently the target of criticism. He was [[Misconduct (football)|sent off]] 12 times in his career, as well as holding the record for the quickest ever booking in a football match, being booked after just three seconds for a foul on [[Dane Whitehouse]] in a [[Premier League]] tie between [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Sheffield United]] in 1992.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/dec/20/newsstory.sport6 Knowledge unlimited]</ref> In his [[autobiography]], he recalls fondly: "I must have been too high, too wild, too strong or too early, because, after three seconds, I could hardly have been too bloody late!". 
In one notorious incident, Jones is photographed grabbing [[Paul Gascoigne]] by his [[testicles]] in order to faze him.<ref>[http://www.weirdpicturearchive.com/pics/vinniejones.html The infamous Vinnie Jones incident - The Weird Picture Archive]</ref> In November 1986, in a match between [[Tottenham Hotspur|Tottenham]] and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], he was responsible for a dangerous challenge on [[Defender (football)|defender]] [[Gary A. Stevens|Gary Stevens]], an injury that Stevens never fully recovered from and eventually caused him to retire in 1992.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-1213742/Martin-Samuel-Going-Hungary-despite-feasting-table.html |title=Diving? We must leave it to the ref |newspaper=Daily Mail |first=Martin |last=Samuel |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>

He also was the presenter of the infamous ''[[Soccer's Hard Men]]'' video released in 1992, which featured archived footage of himself and many other "hard men" of the game, and included advice for budding "hard men".  After the release of the video, Jones was fined <U+00A3>20,000, banned for six months, and suspended for three years from [[The Football Association|The FA]] for "bringing the game into disrepute." Wimbledon chairman [[Sam Hammam]] branded Jones a "mosquito brain". Jones continued to find trouble. After exceeding 40 disciplinary points he was once again summoned to [[Lancaster Gate]], but failed to appear. The FA banned Jones indefinitely. Jones explained that he had "mixed up" the date of the hearing; the FA imposed a four-match ban and told Jones to "grow up."<ref>[[The Sunday Times]]''Illustrated History Of Football'' Reed International Books Limited 1996. p327 ISBN 1-85613-341-9</ref> Jones commented later: "The FA have given me a pat on the back. I've taken violence off the terracing and onto the pitch."<ref>Peter Ball and Paul Shaw ''The umbro Book Of Football Quotations'' Ebury Press 1996. p103 ISBN 0-09-180887-1</ref>

Many of Jones' fellow professionals were quick to condemn both the video and Jones himself. One of his most vocal critics was [[David Ginola]], who said, "Jones does not deserve to be considered a footballer. Getting kicked is part of the job in [[France]] as well as England, but the real scandal is that someone like Jones gets to be a star, to make videos and become an example for kids."

Jones was so desperate to play international football he looked to distant relations and was photographed wearing an [[Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] jersey before being chosen by [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Though [[Jones (surname)|Jones]] is a common surname in Wales, the qualifying relationship was his maternal grandfather, who came from [[Ruthin]], north [[Wales]].  He earned nine caps and even captained the side.

Jones's international call-up was however greeted with consternation and even ridicule by [[Jimmy Greaves]], who said, "Well, stone me! We've had cocaine, bribery and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] scoring two goals at home. But just when you thought there were truly no surprises left in football, Vinnie Jones turns out to be an international player!".

Jones has stated that he would eventually like to return to football, possibly to Leeds. Jones told [[Yorkshire Radio]] "I will come back without a doubt, Leeds fans gave me so much and it's a club very close to my heart."<ref name=SkSp1>Sky Sports (26/10/2006). [http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=424595&CPID=10&clid=2&lid=&title=Jones+backs+Wise+revolution "Jones backs Wise revolution"] SkySports.com (accessed  26th Sept 2006)</ref>

Jones made an appearance in Ireland for [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], coming on as a second-half substitute in 2001 against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], teaming up with friend [[Roddy Collins]] who was manager at the time.

In 1998 Jones published his autobiography, "Vinnie: The Autobiography",<ref name="autobiography">{{cite book | last=Jones|first=Vinnie|title=Vinnie:The Autobiography|publisher=Headline Book Publishing|isbn=0-7472-5914-3 | year=1999}}</ref> which was later revised and reprinted a year later to include information on his 1998 feature film debut in [[Guy Ritchie|Guy Ritchie's]] ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]''. He later starred in Guy Ritchie's next blockbuster, ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' as Bullet-Tooth Tony.

On 6 December 1998, Jones appeared at the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] pay-per-view [[WWF Capital Carnage|Capital Carnage]], where he played up his 'hard man' image, acting as a [[enforcer (professional wrestling)|special guest enforcer]] for the main event. Before the match he had a (staged) fight with fellow enforcer [[Ray Traylor|The Big Bossman]] and was "[[Ejection (sports)|red carded]]" and kicked out. He came back at the end of the show to drink beer with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|"Stone Cold" Steve Austin]] and referee [[Earl Hebner]]. Jones returned to the promotion, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, on 18 February 2007 at [[No Way Out (2007)|No Way Out]], where he claimed he had "kicked Stone Cold's arse" on the set of ''[[The Condemned]]''.

In May 2002, Jones played a character in the music video for Westlife's single 'Bop Bop Baby'. In November 2002, he released an album of blues and soul songs on [[Telstar Records|Telstar]] called ''Respect'' in the UK, as his musical debut under the tuition of Phil Edwards. He also appeared in a series of UK TV advertisements for [[Bacardi]].

Jones appeared on the first episode of the second season of the current Top Gear in their 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' segment.  He managed to make it around the track in 1' 53".

In 2000, Jones caused controversy when he appeared in an ad for a drink called "Red Devil".  In the ad, Jones is pruning flowers in his [[garden]] when he sees a robin crying because its bird feeder is empty.  Jones fills the feeder, and places it on the windowsill of his [[kitchen]].  Seeing the feeder, the robin flies at it, collides with the kitchen window, and slides down the pane while Jones bursts out laughing.  Many parents said the ad (which drew about 390 complaints) was tasteless, and upsetting for children.  Later, the ad was shown only after the nine o'clock [[Watershed (television)|watershed]].  The ad was eventually axed.

Jones was the first ever guest host for ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' when it first aired on [[Channel 4]] in February 2005. In the same year he also had a minor role in the film ''[[She's the Man]]'' as coach Dinklage. As of September 2006, Jones' image and voice are being used in a campaign by UK [[bookmakers]] [[Ladbrokes]] to promote [[greyhound racing]], a sport Jones has been connected with in the past, as a racing dog owner and an enthusiast. Jones has recently appeared as himself in an RAC commercial also featuring his wife, Tanya.

Jones became recognized to American audiences in the 2006 movie, ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', as the mutant, [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. Jones said that he would like to play Juggernaut in a spin-off. His line in the movie, ''I'm the Juggernaut Bitch!'', is based on an already existing Internet parody.

The opening track of [[Joss Stone]] 2007 album ''[[Introducing Joss Stone]]'' features a short speech by Jones.

Jones narrated the TV series ''Vinnie Jones<U+2019> Toughest Cops''.  The series commenced airing in 2008 on [[ITV4]] in the UK.  Each episode to date has examined the work of a police force in a different country in the world, concentrating on dangerous aspects of the work.  The first show concerned police in Colombia.

Vinnie performed a cover version of the song "[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]" on the popular British television show, [[TOTP2]] in December 2002. 

Jones is said to have been cast as [[Kurgan (Highlander)|The Kurgan]] in [[Highlander (2010 film)|the remake]] of the 1986 cult classic ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]''.

Jones also appeared in the US series CHUCK - in episode 2 of the third series he plays an arms dealer (the main villain)

Jones is currently a housemate on the reality television show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2010 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2010]]'',<ref>{{Citation

=== Personal life ===
During his football career he resided in [[Dronfield]], near [[Sheffield]]. Jones married Tanya Terry in 1994 in Watford. She has a daughter, Kaley Jay Terry (born 1987, Watford), by her first husband, footballer [[Steve Terry]]. She had a heart transplant straight after the birth and is a cervical cancer survivor.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-549391/Tanya-believes-spared-save--job-best-life-I-says-Vinnie-Jones.html#ixzz0d6WzjV0G Tanya believes she was spared to save me - and my job is to give her the best life I can, says Vinnie Jones]</ref> Jones has a son, Aaron Elliston Jones (born 1991, Sheffield),<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Births England and Wales 1984-2006]</ref> by Mylene Elliston. Jones, his wife and the two children live in [[Los Angeles]];<ref>[http://www.tribute.ca/people/Vinnie+Jones/3295 Vinnie Jones Star Bio, Tribute.ca]</ref> they also have a home in Hertfordshire.

After participating in a charity football match alongside fellow British [[Hollywood]] film actor [[Jason Statham]], Jones was approached by a [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] scout and asked whether he would go for a trial at the club.  Jones laughed off the offer by saying "You're 15 years too late".<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=472136&in_page_id=1773 Vinnie Jones 'offered a trial' at LA Galaxy after charity match | Mail Online]</ref>

Jones has had several brushes with the law. He was convicted in June 1998 of [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] and [[criminal damage]] against a neighbour in November 1997.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/105051.stm BBC News | UK | Vinnie Jones guilty of assault]</ref> In December 2003, Jones was convicted of [[air rage]] offenses committed on a flight the previous May. Following his conviction, [[Bacardi]] withdrew the ads in which Jones appeared. In December 2008 he was treated for injuries and arrested after a bar fight at Wiley's Tavern in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. The fight is alleged to have been started over Jones attempting to join a game of pool with patrons Juan Barrera and Jesse Bickett. Jones was alleged to have dealt a headbutt to Barrera, while Bickett allegedly struck Jones with a beer glass. Jones was charged with misdemeanor assault which could have landed him in jail for one year if he had been convicted.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5298834.ece Vinnie Jones arrested in bar scuffle] Times Online Retrieved on December 6, 2008.</ref> Jones was found not guilty after a two-day trial on 15 May 2009.
