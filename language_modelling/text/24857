In [[optics]], a '''circle of confusion''', (also known as ''disk of confusion,'' ''circle of indistinctness,'' ''blur circle'', etc.), is an optical spot caused by a cone of light [[ray (optics)|ray]]s from a lens not coming to a perfect [[focus (optics)|focus]] when imaging a point source.

[[Image:Cirles of confusion lens diagram.png|frame|The [[depth of field]] is the region where the size of the circle of confusion is less than the resolution of the human eye. Circles with a diameter less than the circle of confusion will appear to be in focus.]]

==Two uses==

Two important uses of this term and concept need to be distinguished:

1. To calculate a camera's [[depth of field]] (<U+201C>DoF<U+201D>), one needs to know how large a circle of confusion can be considered to be an acceptable focus.  The maximum acceptable diameter of such a circle of confusion is known as the ''maximum permissible circle of confusion,'' the ''circle of confusion diameter limit,'' or the ''circle of confusion criterion,'' but is often incorrectly called simply the ''circle of confusion.''

2. Recognizing that real lenses do not focus all rays perfectly under even the best of conditions, the ''circle of confusion'' of a lens is a characterization of its optical spot.  The term ''circle of least confusion'' is often used for the smallest optical spot a lens can make, for example by picking a best focus position that makes a good compromise between the varying effective [[focal length]]s of different lens zones due to spherical or other [[Aberration in optical systems|aberrations]].  [[Diffraction]] effects from wave optics and the finite [[aperture]] of a lens can be included in the circle of least confusion, or the term can be applied in pure ray (geometric) optics.

In idealized ray optics, where rays are assumed to converge to a point when perfectly focused, the shape of a mis-focused spot from a lens with a circular aperture is a hard-edged disk of light (that is, a ''[[hockey puck|hockey-puck]]'' shape when intensity is plotted as a function of x and y coordinates in the focal plane).  A more general circle of confusion has soft edges due to diffraction and aberrations, and may be non-circular due to the aperture (diaphragm) shape.  So the diameter concept needs to be carefully defined to be meaningful.  The diameter of the smallest circle that can contain 90% of the optical energy is a typical suitable definition for the diameter of a circle of confusion; in the case of the ideal hockey-puck shape, it gives an answer about 5% less than the actual diameter.

==Circle of confusion diameter limit in photography==

In [[photography]], the
circle of confusion diameter limit (<U+201C>CoC<U+201D>) is sometimes defined as
<i>the largest blur circle that will still be perceived by the human eye
as a point when viewed at a distance of 25&nbsp;cm</i> (and variations thereon).

With this definition, the CoC in the original image depends on three
factors:

<ol>
<li>Visual acuity.  For most people, the closest comfortable viewing
distance, termed the ''near distance for distinct vision''
[[#CITEREFRay2002|(Ray 2002, 216)]], is approximately 25&nbsp;cm.  At this
distance , a person with good vision can usually distinguish an [[image resolution]] of 5 line pairs per
millimeter (lp/mm), equivalent to a CoC of 0.2&nbsp;mm in the final image.</li>

<li>Viewing conditions.  If the final image is viewed at approximately
25&nbsp;cm, a final-image CoC of 0.2&nbsp;mm often is appropriate.  A
comfortable viewing distance is also one at which the angle of view is
approximately 60<U+00B0> [[#CITEREFRay2002|(Ray 2002, 216)]]; at a distance of
25&nbsp;cm, this corresponds to about 30&nbsp;cm, approximately the
diagonal of an 8&Prime;<U+00D7>10&Prime; image.  It often may be reasonable to assume
that, for whole-image viewing, an image larger than 8&Prime;<U+00D7>10&Prime; will be
viewed at a distance greater than 25&nbsp;cm, for which a larger CoC may be
acceptable.</li>

<li>Enlargement from the original image 
(the focal plane image on the film or image sensor)
to the final image (print, usually).  If an
[[Large format|8<U+00D7>10]] original image is contact printed, there
is no enlargement, and the CoC for the original image is the same as that
in the final image.  However, if the long dimension of a 35&nbsp;mm image
is enlarged to approximately 25&nbsp;cm (10 inches), the enlargement is
approximately 7<U+00D7>, and the CoC for the original image is 0.2&nbsp;mm&nbsp;/&nbsp;7,
or 0.029&nbsp;mm.</li>
</ol>

All three factors are accommodated with this formula:

:CoC Diameter Limit (mm) = anticipated viewing distance (cm) / desired print resolution (lp/mm) for a 25&nbsp;cm viewing distance / anticipated enlargement factor / 25

For example, to support a print resolution equivalent to 5&nbsp;lp/mm for a 25&nbsp;cm viewing distance when the anticipated viewing distance is 50&nbsp;cm and the anticipated enlargement factor is 8:

:CoC Diameter Limit = 50 / 5 / 8 / 25 = 0.05&nbsp;mm 

Since the final image size is not usually known at the time of taking a
photograph, it is common to assume a standard size such
as 25&nbsp;cm width, along with a conventional final-image CoC of 0.2&nbsp;mm, which is
1/1250 of the image width.  Conventions in terms of the diagonal measure
are also commonly used.  The DoF computed using these conventions
will need to be adjusted if the original image is cropped before enlarging
to the final image size, or if the size and viewing assumptions are altered.

Using the so-called <U+201C>[[Zeiss formula]]<U+201D> the circle of confusion
is sometimes calculated as ''d''/1730 where ''d'' is the diagonal measure
of the original image (the camera format).  For full-frame 35&nbsp;mm
format (24&nbsp;mm&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;36&nbsp;mm, 43&nbsp;mm diagonal) this
comes out to be 0.024&nbsp;mm.  A more widely used CoC is ''d''/1500, or
0.029&nbsp;mm for full-frame 35&nbsp;mm format, which corresponds to
resolving 5 lines per millimeter on a print of 30&nbsp;cm diagonal.  Values
of 0.030&nbsp;mm and 0.033&nbsp;mm are also common for full-frame 35&nbsp;mm
format.  For practical purposes, <var>d</var>/1730, a final-image CoC of
0.2&nbsp;mm, and <var>d</var>/1500 give very similar results.

Angular criteria for CoC have also been used. [[#CITEREFKodak1972|Kodak (1972)]]
recommended 2 minutes of arc (the [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] criterion of
30&nbsp;cycles/degree for normal vision) for critical viewing, giving CoC
<U+2248>&nbsp;<math>f/1720</math>, where <math>f</math> is the lens focal
length.  For a 50&nbsp;mm lens on full-frame 35&nbsp;format, this gave
CoC&nbsp;<U+2248>&nbsp;0.0291&nbsp;mm.  Angular criteria evidently assumed
that a final image would be viewed at <U+201C>perspective-correct<U+201D>
distance (i.e., the angle of view would be the same as that of the original
image):

:Viewing distance = focal length of taking lens <U+00D7> enlargement

However, images seldom are viewed at the <U+201C>correct<U+201D> distance;
the viewer usually doesn't know the focal length of the taking lens,
and the <U+201C>correct<U+201D> distance may be uncomfortably short or
long.  Consequently, angular criteria have generally given way to a CoC
fixed to the camera format.

The common values for CoC may not be applicable if reproduction or viewing
conditions differ significantly from those assumed in determining those
values.  If the photograph will be magnified to a larger size, or viewed at
a closer distance, then a smaller CoC will be required.  If the photo is
printed or displayed using a device, such as a computer monitor, that
introduces additional blur or resolution limitation, then a larger CoC may
be appropriate since the detectability of blur will be limited by the
reproduction medium rather than by human vision; for example, an
8&Prime;<U+00D7>10&Prime; image displayed on a CRT may have
greater depth of field than an 8&Prime;<U+00D7>10&Prime; print
of the same photo, due to the CRT display having lower resolution; the CRT
image is less sharp overall, and therefore it takes a greater misfocus for
a region to appear blurred.

Depth of field formulae derived from [[geometrical optics]] imply that any
arbitrary DoF can be achieved by using a sufficiently small CoC.  Because
of [[diffraction]], however, this isn't quite true.  The CoC is decreased
by increasing the lens [[f-number]], and if the lens is stopped down
sufficiently far, the reduction in defocus blur is offset by the increased
blur from diffraction.  See the [[Depth of field]] article for a more
detailed discussion.

===Calculating a circle of confusion diameter===
[[Image:Circle of confusion calculation diagram.svg|thumb|400px|right|Lens and ray diagram for calculating the circle of confusion diameter ''c'' for an out-of-focus subject at distance ''S<sub>2</sub>'' when the camera is focused at ''S<sub>1</sub>''.  The auxiliary blur circle ''C'' in the object plane (dashed line) makes the calculation easier.]]
[[Image:Long Short Focus 1866.jpg|thumb|400px|An early calculation of COC diameter ("indistinctness") by "T.H." in 1866.]]

To calculate the diameter of the circle of confusion in the focal plane for an out-of-focus subject, the easiest method is to first calculate the diameter of the blur circle in a virtual image in the object plane, which is simply done using similar triangles, and then multiply by the magnification of the system, which is calculated with the help of the lens equation.  

The blur, of diameter ''C'', in the focused object plane at distance ''S<sub>1</sub>'', is an unfocused virtual image of the object at distance ''S<sub>2</sub>'' as shown in the diagram.  It depends only on these distances and the aperture diameter ''A'', via similar triangles, independent of the lens focal length:

:<math> C = A \cdot {|S_2 - S_1| \over S_2}</math>

The circle of confusion in the focal plane is obtained by multiplying by magnification ''m'':

:<math> c = C\cdot m</math>

where the magnification ''m'' is given by the ratio of focus distances:

:<math> m = {f_1 \over S_1}</math>

Using the lens equation we can solve for the auxiliary variable ''f<sub>1</sub>'':

:<math> {1 \over f} = {1 \over f_1} + {1 \over S_1}</math>
:<math> f_1 = {f\cdot S_1 \over S_1 - f}</math>

and express the magnification in terms of focused distance and focal length:

:<math> m = {f \over S_1 - f}</math>

which gives the final result:

:<math> c = A \cdot {|S_2 - S_1| \over S_2}\cdot{f \over S_1 - f}</math>

and which can optionally be expressed in terms of the [[f-number]] ''N'' = ''f/A'' as:

:<math> c = {|S_2 - S_1| \over S_2}\cdot{f^2 \over N(S_1 - f)}</math>

This formula is exact for a simple [[paraxial]] thin-lens system, in which the entrance pupil and exit pupil are both of diameter ''A''.  More complex lens designs with a non-unity pupil magnification will need a more complex analysis, as addressed in [[depth of field]].

More generally, this approach leads to an exact paraxial result for all optical systems if ''A'' is the [[entrance pupil]] diameter, the subject distances are measured from the entrance pupil, and the magnification is known:

:<math> c = A \cdot m \cdot {|S_2 - S_1| \over S_2}</math>

If either the focus distance or the out-of-focus subject distance is infinite, the equations can be evaluated in the limit.  For infinite focus distance:

:<math> c = {f A \over S_2} = {f^2 \over N S_2}</math>

And for the blur of an object at infinity when the focus distance is finite:

:<math> c = {f A \over S_1 - f} = {f^2 \over N(S_1 - f)}</math>

If the ''c'' value is fixed as a circle of confusion diameter limit, either of these can be solved for subject distance to get the [[hyperfocal distance]], with approximately equivalent results.

==History==
===Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge 1838===

Before it was applied to photography, the concept of circle of confusion was applied to optical instruments such as telescopes.  The 1838 ''Natural Philosophy: With an Explanation of Scientific Terms, and an Index'' applied it to third-order aberrations:

:"This spherical aberration produces an indistinctness of vision, by spreading out every mathematical point of the object into a small spot in its picture; which spots, by mixing with each other, confuse the whole.  The diameter of this circle of confusion, at the focus of the central rays F, over which every point is spread, will be L K (fig. 17.); and when the aperture of the reflector is moderate it equals the cube of the aperture, divided by the square of the radius  (...): this circle is called the aberration of latitude."

===T.H. 1866===

Circle-of-confusion calculations: An early precursor to [[depth of field]] calculations is the 1866 calculation of a circle-of-confusion diameter from a subject distance, for a lens focused at infinity, in a one-page article "Long and Short Focus" by an anonymous T. H. (''British Journal of Photography'' XIII p. 138; this article was pointed out by [[Moritz von Rohr]] in his 1899 book ''Photographische Objektive'').  The formula he comes up with for what he terms "the indistinctness" is equivalent, in modern terms, to 

:<math>c = {f A \over S}</math> 

for focal length <math>f</math>, aperture diameter ''A'', and subject distance ''S''.  But he does not invert this to find the ''S'' corresponding to a given ''c'' criterion (i.e. he does not solve for the [[hyperfocal distance]]), nor does he consider focusing at any other distance than infinity.  

He finally observes "long-focus lenses have usually a larger aperture than short ones, and ''on this account'' have less depth of focus" [his italic emphasis].

===Dallmeyer and Abney===

Thomas R. Dallmeyer's 1892 expanded re-publication of his father John Henry Dallmeyer's 1874 pamphlet ''On the Choice and Use of Photographic Lenses'' (in material that is not in the 1874 edition and appears to have been added from a paper by J.H.D. "On the Use of Diaphragms or Stops" of unknown date) says: 

: "Thus every point in an object out of focus is represented in the picture by a disc, or circle of confusion, the size of which is proportionate to the aperture in relation to the focus of the lens employed.  If a point in the object is 1/100 of an inch out of focus, it will be represented by a circle of confusion measuring but 1/100 part of the aperture of the lens."  

This latter statement is clearly incorrect, or misstated, being off by a factor of focal distance (focal length). He goes on: 

: "and when the circles of confusion are sufficiently small the eye fails to see them as such; they are then seen as points only, and the picture appears sharp.  At the ordinary distance of vision, of from twelve to fifteen inches, circles of confusion are seen as points, if the angle subtended by them does not exceed one minute of arc, or roughly, if  they do not exceed the 1/100 of an inch in diameter."

Numerically, 1/100 of an inch at 12 to 15 inches is closer to two minutes of arc.  This choice of COC limit remains (for a large print) the most widely used even today.  Sir Abney, in his 1881 ''A Treatise on Photography'', takes a similar approach based on a visual acuity of one minute of arc, and chooses a circle of confusion of 0.025 cm for viewing at 40 to 50 cm, essentially making the same factor-of-two error in metric units.  It is unclear whether Abney or Dallmeyer was earlier to set the COC standard thereby.

===Wall 1889===

The common 1/100 inch COC limit has been applied to blur other than mis-focus blur.  For example, Edward John Wall, in his 1889 ''A Dictionary of Photography for the Amateur and Professional Photographer'', says:

: To find how quickly a shutter must act to take an object in motion that there may be a circle of confusion less than 1/100in. in diameter, divide the distance of the object by 100 times the focus of the lens, and divide the rapidity of motion of object in inches per second by the results, when you have the longest duration of exposure in fraction of a second.
