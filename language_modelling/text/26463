'''''The News Letter''''' is one of [[Northern Ireland]]'s main daily newspapers, published Monday to Saturday. It is the oldest [[English language]] general daily newspaper still in publication in the world, having first been printed in 1737.<ref>[http://www.bc.edu/libraries/research/guides/s-irishnews/ Research guide: Irish news & newspapers], [[Boston College]], 13 December 2004, accessed 25 September 2006</ref><ref>Ruth Johnston, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/yourplaceandmine/belfast/newsletter.shtml Your place and mine: Belfast News Letter], [[BBC]], accessed 25 September 2006</ref>

The newspaper's editorial stance and readership, while originally [[Irish Republican|republican]],<ref name="A Deeper Silence 1998, pg. 134-164">A Deeper Silence: The Hidden Origins of the United Irishmen, A. T. Q. Stewart, The Blackstaff Press, 1998, ISBN 0-85640-642-2 pg. 134-164</ref> is strongly [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]]. Its primary competitors are the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Irish News]]''. The ''News Letter'' has changed hands several times since the mid-1990s, and since 2005 is owned by the [[Johnston Press]] holding company [[Johnston Publishing (NI)]]. The full legal title of the newspaper is the "Belfast News Letter" though the word [[Belfast]] does not appear on the masthead any more.<ref>[http://www.britishpapers.co.uk/n-ireland/news-letter/ British Newspapers Online]</ref>

==History==
Founded in 1737, the '''Belfast News Letter''' was printed in [[The Belfast Entries|Joy's Entry]] in Belfast. The Joys were a family of [[Huguenot]] descent who added much to eighteenth-century Belfast, noted for their compiling materials for its history. Francis Joy, the father of [[Henry Joy McCracken|Henry]] and Robert, had come to Belfast early in the century from the County Antrim village of [[Killead]]. In Belfast, he married the daughter of the town sovereign, and set up a practice as an attorney. In 1737, he obtained a small printing-press which was in settlement of a debt, and used it to publish the town<U+2019>s first newspaper at the sign of <U+2018>The Peacock<U+2019> in Bridge Street. The family later bought a paper mill in [[Ballymena]], and were able to produce enough paper not only for their own publication but for the whole province of [[Ulster]].<ref>The Life and Times of Mary Ann McCracken, 1770-1866: a Belfast Panorama, Mary McNeill, The Blackstaff Press, rpt 1988</ref><ref>A Deeper Silence: The Hidden Origins of the United Irishmen, A. T. Q. Stewart, The Blackstaff Press, 1998, ISBN 0-85640-642-2</ref>

Originally published three times weekly, it became daily in 1855. The title is now located in the Boucher Road industrial estate in the south of Belfast.

The Belfast News Letter published news of the [[American Declaration of Independence]] in its 23 August 1776 edition.<ref>{{cite book

Before the partition of [[Ireland]] in 1922, the News Letter was distributed island-wide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
