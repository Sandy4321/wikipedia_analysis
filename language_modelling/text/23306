'''''Dog Day Afternoon''''' is a 1975 drama film directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], written by [[Frank Pierson]] and produced by [[Martin Bregman]]. The film stars [[Al Pacino]], [[John Cazale]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Chris Sarandon]], and [[Carol Kane]]. The title refers to the "[[Dog Days|dog days of summer]]".

The film was inspired by [[P.F. Kluge]]'s article "The Boys in the Bank",<ref name="writestuff"/> which tells a similar story of the robbery of a Brooklyn bank by [[John Wojtowicz]] and [[Salvatore Naturile]] on August 22, 1972. This article was published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in 1972.<ref name="life">"The Boys in the Bank" by P.F. Kluge and Thomas Moore for ''Life'', September 22, 1972, Vol. 73(12).</ref> The film received generally positive reviews upon its September 1975 release by [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures (now a [[Time Warner|sister company]] to ''Life''), some of which referred to its [[anti-establishment]] tone. ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]] and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] awards, and won one Academy Award.

==Plot==
First-time crook [[John Wojtowicz|Sonny Wortzik]] (Pacino), his friend Sal (Cazale), and a second accomplice attempt to rob a bank. The plan immediately goes awry when the second accomplice loses his nerve shortly after Sal pulls out his gun, and Sonny is forced to let him flee the scene. In the vault, Sonny discovers that he and Sal have arrived after the daily cash pickup, and only $1100 in cash remains in the bank. To compensate, Sonny takes a number of traveler's checks, but his attempt to prevent the checks from being traced by burning the bank's register in a trash can causes smoke to billow out the side of the building, alerting the business across the street to suspicious activities. Within minutes, the building is surrounded by the police. Unsure what to do, the two robbers camp out in the bank, holding all the workers hostage.

Detective Moretti (Durning) calls the bank to tell Sonny that the police have arrived. Sonny warns that he and Sal have hostages and will kill them if anyone tries to come into the bank. Sal doesn't want to kill anyone and starts getting depressed and worried. Detective Moretti acts as [[Hostage crisis|hostage negotiator]], while [[FBI]] Agent Sheldon monitors his actions. Howard, the security guard has an [[asthma]] attack, so Sonny releases him when Moretti asks for a hostage as a sign of good faith. Moretti convinces Sonny to step outside the bank to see how aggressive the police forces are. Shouting "Attica! Attica!", Sonny invokes the recent [[Attica Prison riot]] in which 39 people were killed, and the civilian crowd starts cheering for Sonny.

After realizing they cannot make a simple getaway, Sonny demands that a helicopter be landed on the roof to fly him and Sal out of the country. When they're informed that the roof of the bank is not sturdy enough to support a helicopter, Sonny demands that a vehicle drive him and Sal to an airport so that they can board a jet. He also demands pizzas for the hostages (which are delivered to the scene) and that his wife be brought to the bank. When Sonny's wife, Leon Schermer (a pre-operative [[transsexual]]), arrives, he reveals to the crowd and officials one of Sonny's reasons for robbing the bank is to pay for Leon's [[sex reassignment surgery]], and that Sonny also has a legal wife, Angie, and children.

As night sets in, the lights in the bank all shut off. Sonny goes outside again and discovers that Agent Sheldon has taken command of the scene. He refuses to give Sonny any more favors, but when the bank manager Mulvaney goes into a diabetic shock, Agent Sheldon lets a doctor through. While the doctor is inside the bank, Sheldon convinces Leon to talk to Sonny on the phone. The two have a lengthy conversation that reveals Leon had [[Parasuicide|attempted suicide]] to "get away from" Sonny. He had been hospitalized at the [[Psychiatric hospital|psychiatric ward]] of [[Bellevue Hospital Center|Bellevue Hospital]] until the police brought him to the scene. Leon turns down Sonny's offer to join him and Sal to wherever they take the plane. Sonny tells police listening to the phone call that Leon had nothing to do with the robbery attempt.

After the phone call, the doctor asks Sonny to let Mulvaney leave and Sonny agrees. Mulvaney refuses, instead insisting he remain with his employees. The FBI calls Sonny out of the bank again. They have brought his mother to the scene. She unsuccessfully tries to persuade him to give himself up and Agent Sheldon signals that a limousine will arrive in ten minutes to take them to a waiting jet. Once back inside the bank, Sonny writes out his [[Will (law)|will]], leaving money from his [[Insurance|life insurance]] to Leon for his sex change and to his wife Angie.

When the limousine arrives, Sonny checks it for any hidden weapons or [[booby trap]]s. When he decides the car is satisfactory, he settles on Agent Murphy to drive Sal, the remaining hostages and him to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy Airport]]. Sonny sits in the front next to Murphy while Sal sits behind them. Murphy repeatedly asks Sal to point his gun at the roof so Sal won't accidentally shoot him. As they wait on the airport [[tarmac]] for the plane to [[Taxiing|taxi]] into position, Agent Sheldon reminds Sal to aim his gun up so he doesn't shoot him by accident. Sal does so, Agent Sheldon forces Sonny's weapon onto the dashboard, creating a distraction which allows Murphy to pull a [[revolver]] hidden in his armrest and shoot Sal in the head. Sonny is immediately arrested and the hostages are all escorted to the [[Airport terminal|terminal]]. The film ends with Sonny watching Sal's body being taken from the car on a [[stretcher]]. Subtitles reveal that Sonny was sentenced to 20 years in prison; Angie and her children subsisted on welfare; and Leon had sexual reassignment surgery.

==Cast==
The ''Life'' article described Wojtowicz as "a dark, thin fellow with the broken-faced good looks of an Al Pacino or [[Dustin Hoffman]]"<ref name="life"/>. Hoffman would later be offered the role when Pacino briefly quit the production. An 18-year-old actor was originally to be cast in the role of Sal to match the age of the actual Salvatore.<ref name=commentary2>Lumet, Sidney.

==Director's cut==
In 1975 a [[director's cut]] of the film was released. It included six minutes of never-before-seen footage, making the film 131 minutes long. In Finland the director's cut was released theatrically rather than the original version.

==Historical event==
[[File:LFChaseP1975.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=A bank building on the corner of a city street. A car can be seen parked out front and a traffic light is located on the sidewalk in front of the building. Other buildings can be seen in the background.|The location of the actual event, 450 Avenue P, Brooklyn NY (1975 photo)]]
The film was based on the story of [[John Wojtowicz]] and adheres to the basic facts of what happened, according to the ''Life'' article "The Boys in the Bank". According to the article, Wojtowicz, along with Sal Naturile, held up a [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] branch in Brooklyn, New York on August 22, 1972.<ref name="life"/>

After being apprehended, Wojtowicz was convicted in court and sentenced to twenty years in prison, of which he served fourteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&LastName=Wojtowicz&Middle=S.&FirstName=John+&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=28&y=18|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator Results for John Stanley Wojtowicz|publisher=United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=2007-10-03|archivedate=2007-10-12

Wojtowicz wrote a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1975 out of concern that people would believe the version of the events portrayed in the film, which he said was "only 30% true". Some of Wojtowicz's objections included the portrayal of his wife Carmen Bifulco, the conversation with his mother that Wojtowicz claimed never happened, and the refusal of police to let him speak to his wife Carmen (unlike what was portrayed in the film). He did, however, praise Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon's portrayals of him and his boyfriend Ernest Aron as accurate.<ref>[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/RealDogDay.html Real ''Dog Day'' hero tells his story] by John Wojtowicz from Jump Cut, no. 15, 1977, pp. 31<U+2013>32. Retrieved March 13, 2007</ref> Also, Sal was 18 years old, yet is played in ''Dog Day Afternoon'' by a 35-year-old.

The film shows Sonny making out a [[Will (law)|will]] to give Leon his life insurance so that even if Sonny should be killed, Leon might still be able to pay for the operation. The real-life Wojtowicz was paid  plus 1% of the film's net profits for the rights to his story,  of which he gave to Ernest Aron to pay for her sexual reassignment surgery.<ref name="trivia1">[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/01/obituaries/elizabeth-eden-transsexual-who-figured-in-1975-movie.html Elizabeth Eden, Transsexual Who Figured in 1975 Movie, New York Times, October 1, 1987]</ref> Aron became [[Elizabeth Eden|Elizabeth Debbie Eden]]<ref name="eden">{{cite web | archivedate=17 December 2003 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031217003529/http://www.gaycenter.org/resources/archive/collection/006 | url=http://www.gaycenter.org/resources/archive/collection/006 | title=Liz Eden Papers | publisher=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Center date=1973<U+2013>1986 (Bulk 1974) | accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref> and lived out the rest of her days in [[New York]].{{fact|date=August 2009}} She died of complications from [[AIDS]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web | archivedate=7 November 2003 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031107234638/http://www.the-sisterhood.net/transworldnews/id9.html | url=http://www.the-sisterhood.net/transworldnews/id9.html | title=Dog Days Afternoon Remembered | first=Yasmene | last=Jabbar | work=Trans World News | accessdate=9 August 2009}}</ref> Wojtowicz himself died of [[cancer]] in January 2006.

==Production==
The original inspiration for the film was an article written by [[P. F. Kluge]] and Thomas Moore for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' in September 1972. The article included many of the details later used in the film and noted the relationship which Wojtowicz and Naturile developed with hostages and the police. Bank manager Robert Barrett said, "I'm supposed to hate you guys [Wojtowicz/Naturile], but I've had more laughs tonight than I've had in weeks. We had a kind of camaraderie." Teller Shirley Bell said,"[I]f they had been my houseguests on a Saturday night, it would have been hilarious."<ref name="life"/> The novelization of the film was penned by organized crime writer, [[Leslie Waller]].

The film has no [[musical score]] other than the [[Elton John]] song "[[Amoreena]]" (which first appeared on John's 1970 album ''[[Tumbleweed Connection]]'') in the opening credits, as well as the [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] song "[[Demons and Wizards (Uriah Heep album)|Easy Living]]" which briefly plays on the radio during a scene inside the bank.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072890/soundtrack</ref> Although many scenes within the bank establish that it was quite hot during the robbery, some outdoor sequences were shot in weather so cold that actors had to put ice in their mouths to stop their breath from showing on camera.{{Verify credibility|date=August 2009}}<ref name="trivia1"/> Exterior shots were filmed on location on Prospect Park West between 17th and 18th Street in [[Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn|Windsor Terrace]] of Brooklyn.

==Response==
Although ''Dog Day Afternoon'' was released nationally in 1975, it is based on events that took place in Brooklyn three years earlier, in 1972. During this era of thick and extremely heavy [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam war]], "anti-establishment" Sonny repeatedly reminds people he is a Vietnam [[veteran]] and repeats the counter-cultural war cry of "[[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica!]]"<ref>[http://www.cornwallmoviemagic.co.uk/fm_12.htm 10 Best Heist Movies Ever] for Movie Magic.

===Critical reactions===
Upon its release, ''Dog Day Afternoon'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews. The film currently holds a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. [[Vincent Canby]] called it "Sidney Lumet's most accurate, most flamboyant New York movie" and praised the "brilliant characterizations" by the entire cast.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=&title2=Dog%20Day%20Afternoon%20%28Movie%29&reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&v_id=14193 Screen: Lumet's ''Dog Day Afternoon''] by Vincent Camby for The New York Times on September 22, 1975.
