Three citizen-initiated measures will appear on the November 6, 2012 ballot in [[Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ELE/ele12/ballot_questions_12/message12.htm ''2012 Information For Voters - Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts'']</ref>

The [[Massachusetts Constitution]] can be amended through [[initiative]] and state statutes can be proposed through initiative.  All three statewide ballot measures that were on the November 2012 ballot by collecting signatures are proposed statutes (not [[constitutional amendment]]s).

In Massachusetts, after the state determines which initiatives have succeeded in collecting enough signatures to be placed on the ballot, official numbers/names are assigned to each of the successful initiatives.  Secretary of State [[William F. Galvin]] has discretion over the order of questions on the ballot.  His office announced that they had determined the ballot ordering "based on the perceived relative importance of the proposed laws."
