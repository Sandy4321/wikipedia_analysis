'''Jane Roberts''' (May 8, 1929 <U+2013> September 5, 1984) was an American author, poet, [[psychic]] and [[Mediumship|spirit medium]], who said she had "[[Channelling (mediumistic)|channeled]]" a personality who called himself "Seth".  Her publication of the Seth texts, known as the "[[Seth Material]]", established her as one of the preeminent figures in the world of paranormal phenomena.<ref name=klimo>{{cite book |title=Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources |first=Jon |last=Klimo |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=1998 |pages=22, 30 |isbn=1-55643-248-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion |first=Catherine L. |last=Albanese |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2007 |pages=501 |isbn=0-300-11089-8}}</ref> The [[Yale University Library]] Manuscripts and Archives maintains a collection entitled ''Jane Roberts Papers (MS 1090)'', which documents the career and personal life of Jane Roberts, including journals, poetry, correspondence, audio and video recordings and other materials donated after her death by Roberts' husband and other individuals and organizations.<ref name=yalelibrary>{{cite web|title=Guide to the Jane Roberts Papers|work=Jane Roberts Papers, Manuscript Group 1090.

==Early life and career==
Roberts was born in a hospital in [[Albany, New York]] but grew up in nearby [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. Her parents, Delmer Hubbell Roberts and Marie Burdo, divorced when she was two years old. With her only child, the young Marie then returned to her own parents, and the home that the family had rented for a number of years: half of a double dwelling in a poor neighborhood in Saratoga Springs. Marie had begun experiencing the early stages of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] by 1932, but worked as much as possible. Eventually Roberts' grandfather, Joseph Burdo, with whom she shared a deep mystical identification, was unable to support two extra people, and the family had to rely upon public assistance.  Roberts' grandmother was killed in an automobile accident in 1936.  The next year, her grandfather moved out of the house. By then Marie was partially incapacitated, and the Welfare Department began to furnish mother and daughter with occasional (and often unreliable) domestic help.<ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 40. ISBN 0-13-938704-8</ref> When Marie became a bedridden invalid, it was Jane<U+2019>s responsibility to take care of her. This included cooking, cleaning, bringing her the bedpan, and getting up in the middle of the night to refuel the stove. Her embittered mother used to tell Jane that she was going to turn on the gas jets in the middle of the night and kill them both. "My mother was a real bitch," Jane said, "but she was an energetic bitch. When my mother attempted suicide for about the fifth time, she took a whole mess of sleeping pills and was in the hospital. I went to the welfare lady and said, 'I can<U+2019>t take it anymore. I<U+2019>ve just got to leave.'"<ref name="Kendall, Richard">{{cite web|url=http://realtalkworld.com/2010/12/01/memories-of-jane-roberts/|title=Memories of Jane Roberts|author=Kendall, Richard}}</ref> Over and over Marie told Jane that she was no good, that the daughter's birth had caused the mother's illness, that she was disowned and considered no longer her daughter.  The persistent psychological abuse and mistreatment by her mother resulted in the young girl's deep fear of abandonment.  Such situations increased Jane's sense of not being safe, yet also reinforced feelings of independence, for she did not have to feel as dependent upon Marie as she might otherwise. Well before she was 10 years old Jane had developed persistent symptoms of [[colitis]]. By her early teens she had an [[hypothyroidism|overactive thyroid gland]]. Her vision was poor; she required very strong glasses (which she seldom wore). For most of 1940 and half of 1941 Jane was in a strictly-run Catholic orphanage in [[Troy, NY]] while her mother was hospitalized in another city for treatment of her arthritis.  Priests came to the house regularly and support was offered to the fatherless family.  Jane's initial bonding to the cultural beliefs of religion was very strong to make up for the lack of a loving, nurturing family.  However, some of Jane's very early poetry using ideas akin to reincarnation offended one priest, who burned her books on the fall of Rome. The 'troublesome' material remained relatively inactive until her curiosity and ability led her to actively challenge those ideas while she was also in a situation where the natural fear of abandonment might be suggested. For a time she was left between belief systems. Jane began working at a  variety store in the summer of 1945, when she was 16 years old.  It was her first job.  That fall she continued on the job after school hours, and on an occasional Saturday. After attending public schools, Jane attended [[Skidmore College]] from 1947 to 1950. Roberts' grandfather died when she was age 19.  It was a time of severe shock for her. She was beginning to substitute scientific belief for religious belief.<ref name=yalelibrary/><ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 30.

Jane had been going with a fellow named Walt at the time, and they decided to go to the west coast by motorcycle to see Jane<U+2019>s father (who had also come from a broken home). Walt and Jane then married, living together for three years. She "then found out <U+2014> [while she] was working in a radio factory putting lover-boy Walt through school what everybody else in town knew <U+2013> [that] he isn't going through school."  It was then in February 1954 that Jane first met the former commercial artist Robert F. Butts (born June 20, 1919). The fourth time they met, at a party and never having dated, Jane "just looked at him and said, 'Look, I<U+2019>m leaving Walt, and I'm going to live by myself or I'm going to live with you, so just let me know."<ref name="Kendall, Richard"/> Jane and Rob married on December 27, 1954.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3nPYfqEbfrsC&pg=PA1049&lpg=PA1049&dq=Robert+F+Butts+1955&source=bl&ots=ZC62XtS5XL&sig=4On-0BeVabd1Z2WfPbcA5GrUXkk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QASwUJq0IcT_ygGz64A4&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=Robert%20F%20Butts%201955&f=false|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2|author=Reginald, Robert|publisher=Borgo Press |year= 2010|page= 1049}}</ref><ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 524. ISBN 0-13-219460-0</ref> 

She wrote in a variety of genres:  poetry, short stories, children<U+2019>s literature, nonfiction, science fiction and fantasy and novels.  When she was in her 30s, she and her husband, Robert, began to record what she said were messages from a personality named "Seth", and she wrote several books about the experience.

==Seth Material==
{{main|Seth Material}}
In late 1963, Roberts and Butts, living in the [[Elmira, New York]] area, experimented with a ''[[Ouija]]'' board as part of Roberts' research for a book on [[extra-sensory perception]].<ref>''ESP Power'', by Jane Roberts (2000) (introductory essay by Lynda Dahl). ISBN 0-88391-016-0</ref> According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth.  Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head.  She began to [[Dictation (exercise)|dictate]] the messages instead of using the Ouija board, and she eventually abandoned the board. 

Roberts described the process of writing the ''Seth'' books as entering a trance state.  She said Seth would assume control of her body and speak through her, while her husband wrote down the words she spoke.  They referred to such episodes as "readings" or "sessions".<ref>''Conversations With Seth, Book 2: 25th Anniversary Edition'', by Susan M. Watkins (2006). ISBN 978-1-930491-09-0</ref>

Roberts also purportedly channeled the world views of several other people,<ref name=klimo/> including the philosopher [[William James]],<ref>Stanley Fisher and John Edminster, "William James.... Ghostwriter?", ''[[Fate (magazine)|FATE]]'' #350, pp. 61<U+2013>66 (1979)</ref> [[Rembrandt]], and the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Paul C<U+00E9>zanne]],<ref name=klimo/><ref>{{cite book|title=Spirit Summonings: Mysteries of the Unknown |last=Time-Life Books (editor)|publisher=Time-Life Books|year= 1989|page=137 |isbn=0-8094-6344-X}}</ref> through a process she described as using a typewriter to write "[[Automatic writing|automatically]]."<ref name=lewismelton>{{cite book|title=Perspectives on the New Age|last=Lewis|first=James R.|coauthors=J.

ISBN 0-13-938852-4</ref>  

For 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held regular trance sessions in which she spoke on behalf of Seth.<ref>Roger Woolger, ''Other Lives, Other Selves: A Jungian Psychotherapist Discovers Past Lives'', (1988). ISBN 978-0-553-34595-7</ref> Butts served as stenographer, taking the messages down in home-made [[shorthand]], and having others on occasion make [[sound recording|recording]] of some sessions.<ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 491. ISBN 0-13-219460-0</ref> The messages from Seth channeled through Roberts consisted mostly of monologues on a wide variety of topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sethapplied.com/Index%20of%20ElevenBooks.pdf|title=Index of Eleven Seth Books|author=Williams, Sue R.}}</ref> They were published by [[Prentice-Hall]] under the collective title ''Seth Material''.

Over the years, hundreds of people witnessed Seth speaking. Some went to the ESP classes Roberts held (Tuesday and some Thursday nights,  Sept. 1967<U+2013> Feb. 1975)<ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 202. ISBN 0-13-219452-X</ref> for an evening, others attended for longer periods. Outside of the class structure, Roberts gave many personal Seth sessions to various individuals who had written her, asking for help. She never charged for those sessions; however, at some point she did charge $2.50 to $3.50 per ESP class of 5 to 40 people. When the books began to sell in sufficient numbers, she dropped that fee.<ref name="Kendall, Richard"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiritual-endeavors.org/seth/howitall.htm|title=How it all began}}</ref>  Book sessions were almost always private, held on Monday and Wednesday evenings without witnesses from 1967 through 1982 (except for Tues and Thurs from Aug to Nov 1981).<ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 7. ISBN 0-13-938704-8</ref><ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 453, 499. ISBN 0-13-219460-0</ref> 

The material through 1969 was published in summary form in ''The Seth Material'', written by Roberts from the output of the channeling sessions. Beginning in January 1970, Roberts wrote books which she described as dictated by Seth.  Roberts claimed no authorship of these books beyond her role as medium. This series of "Seth books" totaled ten volumes.  The last two books appear to be incomplete due to Roberts' illness.  Butts contributed extensive [[footnotes]], appendices, and other comments to all the Seth books, and thus was a [[collaborative writing|co-author]] on all of them.  These additions describe what was going on in Roberts' and his life at the time of the various sessions, annotated some of Seth's comments in light of contemporary beliefs and materials that Roberts and Butts were reading, described excerpts from some fan mail and letters from professionals commenting on Seth's material about their fields, and especially later, provided insight as to the [[galley proof|many steps of production]] of multiple books with the publisher. By February 1982 they were still receiving <U+201C>from 30 to 50 letters and packages a week<U+201D> from readers of their various books.<ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 2', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 536. ISBN 0-13-219460-0</ref> Some of Roberts' earlier and later poetry was occasionally included to show how she had touched upon some of Seth's concepts.<ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pp. 62, 91, 121<U+2013>122, .

ISBN 0-13-219460-0</ref> Roberts also wrote ''The Oversoul Seven'' trilogy to explore via fiction some of Seth's teachings on the concepts of reincarnation and oversouls.

According to Roberts, Seth described himself as an "energy personality essence no longer focused in physical matter", and was independent of Roberts' [[subconscious]].  Roberts initially expressed skepticism as to Seth's origins, wondering if he was a part of her own personality.<ref name=klimo/> As Seth, Roberts at times appeared stern, jovial or professorial. "His" voice was deeper and more masculine sounding than Jane's and was possessed of a distinct, although not identifiable, accent.<ref>''Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul'', by Jane Roberts, notes by Robert F. Butts, p. 2 (1972, 1994). ISBN 978-1-930491-09-0</ref> Unlike the psychic [[Edgar Cayce]], whose [[syntax]] when speaking in trance was antiquated and convoluted, Roberts' syntax and sentence structures were modern and clear when speaking as Seth.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tyler|first=Paula|title=New Age Metaphysics: An Introduction for Young Adults|year=1987|publisher=Ozark Mountain Publishing|isbn=0-9617920-0-0|page=40}}</ref> Later books continued to develop but did not contradict the material introduced in earlier works.

ISBN 0-13-938696-3</ref>

A few contemporary world events were commented upon by Seth, such as the [[Jonestown]] Guyana deaths <ref>''The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events'', by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 177<U+2013>180. ISBN 0-13-457259-9</ref> and the [[Three Mile Island accident]].<ref>''The Individual and the Nature of Mass Events'', by Jane Roberts (1981), pp. 191<U+2013>204. ISBN 0-13-457259-9</ref>

Seth also provided an alternative [[creation myth]] to that of either the [[Big Bang]] or [[Intelligent Design]].<ref name="Helfrich, Paul M. Ph.D. 2005">{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100405105538/http://newworldview.com/library/Helfrich_P_Seth_on_a_Conscious_Creation_Myth.html|title=Seth on ''The Origins of the Universe and of the Species'' ~ An Integral Conscious Creation Myth |author=Helfrich, Paul M. Ph.D. |year=2005}}</ref>

Roberts' father died in November 1971 at the age of 68; her mother died six months later at the same age.<ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 189. ISBN 0-13-938704-8</ref> In early 1982 Roberts spent a month in the hospital for severely [[hyperthyroidism|underactive thyroid gland]], protruding eyes and double vision, an almost total hearing loss, a slight [[anemia]], budding [[pressure ulcer|bedsores]]<U+2014>and a hospital-caused [[staph infection]]<ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pp. 18<U+2013>19. ISBN 0-13-219452-X</ref>  She recovered to an extent, but died two and a half years later in 1984, having been bedridden with severe arthritis<U+2014>like her mother<U+2014>for the final year and a half of her life. (Butts believed for some 15 years that in Roberts' case, at least, the young girl's psychological conditioning was far more important<U+2014>far more damaging, in those terms<U+2014>than any physical tendency to inherit the disease.<ref>''Dreams, 'Evolution,' and Value Fulfillment, Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1986), pg. 76. ISBN 0-13-219452-X</ref>) After Roberts<U+2019> death, lovingly recorded in ''The Way Toward Health'' (1997), Butts continued his work as a guardian of the Seth texts and continued to supervise the publication of some of the remaining material, including ''The Early Sessions,'' and making sure that all of the recordings, manuscripts, notes and drawings related to the extraordinary encounters with Seth would be given to the [[Yale University Library|Yale Library]]. Butts remarried, and his second wife, Laurel, supported his work during the more than twenty years of their marriage. Butts died in May 2008, but the vitality of the teachings he helped to bring to the world continues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://californiasethconference.com/about-seth.html|title=About Seth, Jane Roberts and Robert Butts |publisher=California Seth Conference}}</ref> A number of groups have compiled anthologies of quotes from Seth,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nirvikalpa.com/content.php?page=seth Nirvikalpa/|title=Seth/Jane Roberts}}</ref> summarized sections of his teachings,<ref name="Helfrich, Paul M.

===Reception and influence===
Seth's effect upon New Age thinkers has been profound. The title jacket of "The Nature of Personal Reality, A Seth Book" published in 1994 (Amber-Allen/New World Library) contains testimonials from some of the most notable thinkers and writers within the movement. [[Marianne Williamson]], [[Deepak Chopra]], [[Shakti Gawain]], [[Dan Millman]], [[Louise Hay]], [[Richard Bach]], and others express the effect the Seth Material had upon their own awakening. In words similar to Williamson's they state: "Seth was one of my first metaphysical teachers. He remains a constant source of knowledge and inspiration in my life." Catherine L. Albanese, professor of religious history at the [[University of Chicago]], stated that in the 1970s the Seth Material "launched an era of nationwide awareness" of the channeling trend.  She believes it contributed to the "self-identity of an emergent New Age movement and also augment[ed] its ranks."<ref>{{cite book|title=A Republic of Mind and Spirit: A Cultural History of American Metaphysical Religion|first=Catherine L.|last=Albanese |publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|pages=501 |isbn=0-300-11089-8}}</ref> 

John P. Newport, in his study of the impact of New Age beliefs on contemporary culture, described the central focus of the Seth material as the idea that, for each individual: "you create your own reality". (Briefly summarized, our beliefs generate emotions which trigger our memories and organize our associations.  Eventually those beliefs become manifested in our physical lives and health.<ref>''The Nature of the Psyche', by Jane Roberts (1979), pg. 49. ISBN 0-13-610469-X</ref>) Newport wrote that this foundational concept of the New Age movement was first developed in the "Seth Material".<ref name=newport>{{cite book|title=The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue|first=John P. |last=Newport|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1998|pages=165|isbn=0-8028-4430-8}}</ref> Historian Robert C. Fuller, a professor of religious studies at [[Bradley University]], wrote that Seth filled the role of guide for what Fuller called "unchurched American spirituality", related to concepts of [[reincarnation]], ''[[karma]]'', [[free will]], ancient metaphysical wisdom, and "Christ consciousness".<ref name=fuller>{{cite book| title=Spiritual, But Not Religious: Understanding Unchurched America |first=Robert C.|last=Fuller|pages=60|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001 |isbn=0-19-514680-8}}</ref>

Some writers noted, "Husband Robert Butts stated that similarities exist between Seth's ideas and those of various religious, philosophical, and mystical doctrines from the Near, Middle, or Far East.... and we've done a little reading on [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Zen]], and [[Taoism]], for example, not to mention subjects like [[shamanism]], [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]]ism, and [[obeah]]."<ref name="app">Kole, Andre; E Calvin Beisner, Robert M Bowman Jr, Terry Holley [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3bw0WdaLEpcC& ''Astrology and Psychic Phenomena''] Zondervan Publishing House, 1989  ISBN 978-0-310-48921-4</ref><ref>''The 'Unknown' Reality', Vol. 1'', by Jane Roberts (1977), pg. 12. ISBN 0-13-938704-8</ref>  

The late amateur [[physicist]] [[Michael Talbot (author)|Michael Talbot]] wrote, "To my great surprise<U+2014>and slight annoyance<U+2014>I found that Seth eloquently and lucidly articulated a view of reality that I had arrived at only after great effort and an extensive study of both [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[quantum physics]]."<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Beyond the Quantum'', Bantam Paperback, 1988</ref>

===Criticism===
Roberts and the ''Seth Material'' have attracted critiques from outside the paranormal community. The poet [[Charles Upton (poet)|Charles Upton]], in his collection of essays titled ''The System of Antichrist'', posited that Roberts multiplied the self due to a fear of death.  His opinion was that the Seth texts are based on a misunderstanding of both Christianity and of Eastern religions.<ref>{{cite book|title=The System of Antichrist: Truth and Falsehood in Postmodernism and the New Age|first=Charles|last=Upton|publisher=Sophia Perennis|year=2005|pages=173|isbn=0-900588-38-1}}</ref>

Professor of psychology and noted critic of parapsychology [[James Alcock|James E. Alcock]] opined, "In light of all this, the Seth materials must surely be viewed as less than ordinary. There certainly was the time and talent for fraud to play a role, but we cannot discriminate between that possibility and the possibility of unconscious production<U+2014> At any rate, given these circumstances, there seems little need to consider the involvement of any supernatural agency."<ref name="app"/>

Seth's teaching of a philosophy far more detailed than and not in keeping with traditional Church-authority, God-separate-from Creation, one-mortal-life, Jesus-centered messages has also received its share of criticism from some Christian believers. Various ministries have warned their members about the dangers and deceptions of reading channeled messages from Roberts and others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letusreason.org/NAM13.htm |title=Channeling <U+2013> a spirit speaks}}</ref> ''The Seth Material'' has been considered in certain circles to be "a book entirely written by a demon.

Since Roberts' death, others have claimed to channel Seth.<ref name="fuller" /> In the introduction to Seth's first dictated book, ''Seth Speaks'', "he" says, "communications will come exclusively through Ruburt [Seth's name for Jane] at all times, to protect the integrity of the material". In ''The Seth Material'', Jane Roberts wrote: "Several people have told me that Seth communicated with them through automatic writing, but Seth denies any such contacts." At least one person has claimed to channel Roberts.<ref>''Jane Roberts' A View From The Other Side'', Mary Maracek (1997). ISBN 0-9663258-0-X</ref>

In The Nature of Personal Reality, Jane Roberts and Robert F. Butts, Jr, were perfectly clear when their book clearly stated Seth is "Another dimensional aspect of Jane's multi-dimensional personality", and it was explained "Seth" was the name given by this other dimensional aspect of Jane's multi-dimensional personality to Jane and Rob, to describe the "favorite" probable self incarnation, which the above said other dimensional aspet of Jane's multi-dimensional personality once experienced, along with the image of that "favorite" incarnation, which is in the form of a bald headed man. People from around the world have misunderstood her writings and suggested that some dis-incarnate spirit or other world entity communited through Jane, and in some places "Seth" acquired a cult following. Seth was never a man. Seth was (is) another dimensional aspect of the multi-dimensional personality Jane was part of while she was here, yet its identity and form is "not translatable into three dimensional reality." ==Reference==The Nature of Personal Reality, by Jane Roberts.</reference>
