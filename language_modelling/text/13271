'''Les Thermes''' is a [[water park]] in [[Strassen]], just west of [[Luxembourg City]] in the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]].

==The complex==

The facility consists of an Olympic swimming pool, two children's pools, wave baths, slides, solarium, sauna and fitness centre. The award was based on its suitability for a wide range of visitors, its striking modern architecture and its well-conceived design uniting the pools, the changing rooms and the fitness centre.<ref name=Wort/>

Les Thermes, a joint enterprise of the communes of [[Bertrange]] and Strassen, was built at a cost of EUR 34 million.<ref>[http://www.wort.lu/wort/web/letzebuerg/artikel/06580/erlebnisbad-les-thermes-oeffnet-seine-tore.php "Erlebnisbad 'Les Thermes' hat seine Tore ge<U+00F6>ffnet"], ''Luxemburger Wort'', 3 February 2009. {{De icon}} Retrieved 19 February 2011.</ref>

==Design==

After a competition, the firms chosen to design the complex were [[Witry & Witry]], [[Jim Clemes|Jim Clemes Architectes]] and [[Hermann Valentiny & Associ<U+00E9>s]]. Sometimes compared to a spacecraft, the concrete building's shape is the result of its rounded wooden roof coupled with a rounded fa<U+00E7>ade faced with aluminium strips. In addition to stainless steel swimming pools, the fitness and recreation areas are positioned over three levels. Large skylights on the roof ensure maximum use of sunlight in the building.<ref>[http://www.floornature.com/notizia.php?id=5303&sez=1 "Les Thermes in Strassen, Luxembourg"], ''Floornature.''
