'''Tokaji''', meaning "of Tokaj" in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], is used to label wines from the wine region of [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]] in [[Hungary]]. A small quantity of wines from the Slovak wine region of [[Tokaj (region in Slovakia)|Tokaj]]  also use the Tokaj label, and are referred to as ''Tokajsk<U+00FD>/-<U+00E1>/-<U+00E9>'', meaning "of Tokaj" in [[Slovak language|Slovak]].

==The Tokaji name==
Tokaji wines have a long pedigree and history, which has unfortunately resulted in some abuse of the name:

*Historically Tokaji was wine from the region of Tokaj in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In English and French the spelling [[Tokay]] was commonly used. Prior to the [[phylloxera]] epidemic, wine was grown in Tokaj from various types of mainly white grape varieties. However many historical mentions of Tokaji wine referred to the sweet asz<U+00FA> dessert wine.
*The name ''[[Tokay]]'' came to be used in the [[Alsace wine|Alsace]] region of France for wines made with the [[Pinot Gris]] grape. In [[Italy]] the name ''Tocai'' came to refer to a variety of grape from the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region.
*In [[1920]], a small portion of the Tokaj wine region (approx. 1.75 km<U+00B2>) became part of the newly-created state of [[Czechoslovakia]], the remaining much bigger part became part of the newly-created Republic of [[Hungary]].
*Under Hungary's and Slovakia's accession treaty to the [[European Union]], the ''Tokaj'' name (including other forms of spelling) is being given [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Designation of Origin]] status. This means that wine producers in France and Italy will no longer be allowed to use the terms ''Tokay'' or ''Tocai'' after March 2007.
*Non-EU nations, notably the Ukraine, Australia and the U.S., produce liqueurs or dessert wines which they label "Tokay".
*There has also been a long-running dispute between Hungary and Czechoslovakia (since 1993 Slovakia) over the right of the Slovakian wine region to use the name ''Tokaj''. Negotiations between the two governments resulted in an agreement being signed in June 2004. Under this agreement, wine produced on 5.65 km<U+00B2> of land in Slovakia will be able to use the ''Tokaj'' name. However, a number of practical issues remain. Slovakia has pledged to introduce the same standards enshrined in Hungarian wine laws since 1990, but it has not yet been decided who will monitor or enforce those laws.
Tokaji wine was cause of the creation of the world's first [[appellation|appellation control]], established in [[1730]], several decades before [[Port wine]]. Vineyard classification began in 1730 with vineyards being classified into 3 categories depending on the soil, sun exposure and potential to develop botritys cinerea. The subdvisions were: first class, second class and third class wines. A royal decree in 1757 established a closed production district in Tokaj.  The classification system was completed by the national censuses of [[1765]] and [[1772]].

==Cultivation==
Nowadays, only four grape varieties are officially approved for use in wines bearing the Tokaj name: [[Furmint]], [[H<U+00E1>rslevel<U+0171>]] (Slovak: ''Lipovina''),  Yellow [[muscat grape|Muscat]] (Hungarian: ''S<U+00E1>rgamuskot<U+00E1>ly'', Slovak: ''<U+017D>lt<U+00FD> mu<U+0161>k<U+00E1>t'') and [[Z<U+00E9>ta]], a crossing of Furmint and [[Bouvier (grape)|Bouvier]]. Of these, Furmint accounts for 70% of the area under vine and is by far the most important grape in the production of asz<U+00FA> wines. Nevertheless, an impressive range of different types and styles of wine is produced in the region, ranging from dry whites to the world's sweetest wine.

The area in which Tokaji wine is traditionally grown is a small plateau, 457m (1500 ft) above sea level, near the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The soil there is of volcanic origin, with a high concentration of [[iron]] and smaller amounts of [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. The location of the region experiences a unique climate which is beneficial to this particular viniculture, due largely to the protection of the nearby mountains. Winters are bitterly cold and windy; spring tends to be cool and dry, and summers noticeably hot. Usually autumn brings rain early on, followed by an extended [[Indian summer]], allowing a very long ripening period.

The dominant Furmint grapes begin maturation with thick skins, but as they ripen the skins become thinner, and transparent. This allows the sun to penetrate the grape and evaporate much of the water inside, producing a higher proportion of sugar. Other grapes mature to the point of bursting, and some juice escapes; however, unlike with most other grapes, Furmint grow a second skin after this which seals it from rot. This also has the effect of concentrating the grapes' natural sugars. The grapes are left on the vine long enough to develop a "[[noble rot]]" condition.

At harvest, the grapes are collected into 28-liter (30-quart) wooden containers called ''puttony'' (adjective: ''puttonyos'').  From there, they are transferred to a ''g<U+00F6>nci hord<U+00F3>'' (cask of [[G<U+00F6>nc]]), which holds 136 liters (36 gallons). Since the grapes are collected overripe, as the ''g<U+00F6>nci hord<U+00F3>'' is filled, the weight of the grapes on top crushes the bottom grapes. The quality of a particular vintage can therefore be calculated by how many ''puttonys'' it takes to fill the ''g<U+00F6>nci hord<U+00F3>.''

Typical yearly production in the region runs to a relatively small 10,028,000 liters (2,650,000 gallons).

==Types of Tokaji wine==
The list below refers to types of wine produced in the Hungarian region of Tokaj-Hegyalja. For Slovakian Tokaj wines see [[Tokaj (region in Slovakia)|Tokaj]].

*'''Dry Wines:''' These wines, once referred to as ''ordin<U+00E1>rium'', are now named after their respective grape varieties: Tokaji Furmint, Tokaji H<U+00E1>rslevel<U+0171> and Tokaji S<U+00E1>rgamuskot<U+00E1>ly.
*'''Szamorodni:''' (Slovak: ''samorodn<U+00E9>'') This type of wine was initially known as ''f<U+0151>bor'' ("prime wine"), but since the 19th century the Polish word ''szamorodni'' ("the way it was grown") has been used. What sets Szamorodni apart from ordinary wine is that it is made from bunches which contain a considerable proportion of [[Botrytis cinerea|botrytised]] grapes. Because of this, szamorodni is typically higher in alcohol and extract than ordinary wine. Szamorodni often contains up to 100-120 g of residual sugar and thus is termed ''<U+00E9>des'' ("sweet"). However, when the bunches contain fewer botrytised grapes, the residual sugar content is much lower, resulting in a ''sz<U+00E1>raz'' ("dry") wine. Its alcohol content is typically 14%.
*'''Asz<U+00FA>:''' (Slovak: ''v<U+00FD>ber'') This is the wine which made Tokaj world famous and is proudly cited in the [[Himnusz|Hungarian national anthem]]. The original meaning of the Hungarian word ''asz<U+00FA>'' was "dried", but it came to be associated with a type of wine made with [[Botrytis cinerea|botrytised]] (i.e. "nobly" rotten) grapes. According to legend the first asz<U+00FA> was made by Laczk<U+00F3> M<U+00E1>t<U+00E9> Szepsi in 1630. However, mention of wine made from asz<U+00FA> grapes had already appeared in the ''Nomenklatura'' of Fabricius Bal<U+00E1>zs Sziksai which was completed in [[1576]]. A recently discovered inventory of asz<U+00FA> predates this reference by five years. The process of making Asz<U+00FA> wine is as follows:
**Asz<U+00FA> berries are individually picked out of the bunches, collected in huge vats and trampled into the consistency of paste (known as asz<U+00FA> dough).
**[[Must]] is poured on the asz<U+00FA> dough and left for 24-48 hours, stirred occasionally.
**After the asz<U+00FA> dough has soaked, the wine is racked off into wooden casks or vats where fermentation is completed and the asz<U+00FA> wine will be kept to mature. These containers are stored in a cool environment, and are not tightly closed, so a slow fermentation process continues in the wine, usually for several years.
:The concentration of asz<U+00FA> was traditionally defined by the number of ''puttony'' ("hods", Slovak: ''put<U+0148>a'') of dough added to a G<U+00F6>nc cask (136 liter barrel) of must. Nowadays the ''puttony'' number is based on the content of sugar and sugar-free extract in the mature wine. Asz<U+00FA> ranges from 3 ''puttonyos'' to 6 ''puttonyos'', with a further category called Asz<U+00FA>-Eszencia representing wines above 6 ''puttonyos''. Unlike most other wines, alcohol content of asz<U+00FA> typically runs higher than 14%. Annual production of asz<U+00FA> is less than one percent of the region's total output.
*'''Eszencia:''' (Slovak: ''esencia'') Also called nectar, this is often described as the most precious wine in the world, although technically it cannot even be called a wine because its enormous concentration of sugar means that its alcohol level never rises above 5-6 degrees. Eszencia is the juice of asz<U+00FA> berries which runs off naturally from the vats in which they are collected during harvesting. The sugar concentration of eszencia is typically between 500 g and 700 g per litre, although the year 2000 vintage produced eszencia exceeding 900 g per litre. Eszencia is traditionally added to asz<U+00FA> wines, but may be allowed to ferment (a process that typically takes at least 4 years to complete) and then bottled pure.  The resulting wine has a concentration and intensity of flavour that is unequalled, but is so sweet that it can only be drunk in tiny quantities.
:Eszencia is incredibly costly, and generally not available at any price on the open market. The vast majority of it is stored away to be added to asz<U+00FA> of lesser-quality vintages. Storage is facilitated by the fact that, unlike virtually all other wines, it maintains its quality and drinkability for 200 years or more. A newspaper account of the [[1933]] wedding of Polish president [[Ignacy Mo<U+015B>cicki]] notes that toasts were made with 250-year-old wine, and goes on to say "The wine, if good, could only have been Essence of Tokay, and the centuries-old friendship between Poland and Hungary would seem to support this conclusion."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*'''Ford<U+00ED>t<U+00E1>s:''' (Slovak: ''ford<U+00ED>t<U+00E1><U+0161>'') Meaning "turning over" in Hungarian, this wine is made by pouring must on asz<U+00FA> dough which has already been used to make asz<U+00FA> wine.
*'''M<U+00E1>sl<U+00E1>s:''' (Slovak: ''m<U+00E1><U+0161>l<U+00E1><U+0161>'') Derived from the word "copy" in Hungarian, this wine is made by pouring must on the lees of asz<U+00FA>.
*'''Other sweet wines:''' In the past few years reductive sweet wines have begun to appear in Tokaj. These are ready for release in a year to 18 months are harvest. They typically contain 50-180 g/l of [[residual sugar]] and a ratio of botrytised berries comparable to Asz<U+00FA> wines. They are usually labelled as ''k<U+00E9>s<U+0151>i sz<U+00FC>retel<U+00E9>s<U+0171>'' ("[[Late harvest wine|late harvest]]") wines. Innovative producers have also marketed tokaji wine, not fitting the prescriptions of the above categories but often of high quality and price, in many ways comparable to asz<U+00FA>, simply labelled ''tokaji cuv<U+00E9>e.''

==Famous drinkers of Tokaji==
Nothing better illustrates the pedigree of Tokaji wine than an account of some of its famous drinkers. In 1703, [[Francis R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi II]], Prince of Transylvania, gave King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France numerous bottles from his Tokaj estate as a gift. Tokaji was then served at the Versailles Court, where it became known under the name of Tokay. Delighted with the precious beverage, [[Louis XV of France]] offering a glass of Tokaj to [[Madame de Pompadour]] entitled  it the "Wine of Kings, King of Wines" ("Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum"). This famous refrain is used to this day as a marketing device for Tokaji wines.

Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] had a tradition of sending Queen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] a gift of Tokaji Asz<U+00FA> every year on her birthday, twelve bottles for each year of her age. By her eighty-first birthday ([[1900]]), this totalled an impressive 972 bottles.

Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]; [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]]'s favorite wine was a Tokaji. Besides Louis XIV, several other European leaders are known to have been keen consumers of the wine. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Frederick the Great]] tried to outdo one another in the excellence of the vintages they stocked when they treated [[Voltaire]] or [[Alexandre Dumas, p<U+00E8>re|Dumas]] to some Tokaji. [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], the last [[List of French monarchs|Emperor of the French]], ordered 30&ndash;40 barrels of Tokaji for the Court every year. [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]], King of Sweden, never had any other wine to drink. In Russia, customers included [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. 

The papal devotion to Tokaji wine is even older. Pope [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], after a sip of sweet wine from [[T<U+00E1>llya]], punned at the [[Council of Trent]], ''...patrem sanctum talia vina decent!'' ( [[Latin language|Latin]] for: ''Such wine (i.e. of T<U+00E1>llya) is what is worthy of the Holy Father.'') When [[Pope Benedict XIV|Benedict XIV]] received a gift of Tokaji from Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] he famously punned, ''Benedicta sit terra, quae te germinavit, benedicta mulier, qui te misit, Benedictus ego, qui te bibi'' (Latin for: ''Blessed be the soil that hath grown thee, blessed be the woman who sent thee, and blessed (i.e. Benedict) am I who drink thee.'')
