The '''Norfolk Tides''' are a [[minor league baseball]] team in the Triple-A [[International League]]. They play at [[Harbor Park]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Since 2007 they have been a [[farm team]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]; prior to that, they had a 38-year affiliation with the [[New York Mets]].

==Franchise History==
The franchise began its history in the [[South Atlantic League]] in [[1961]] as the '''Tidewater Tides ''', playing at Lawrence Stadium in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. The main newspaper of [[South Hampton Roads]], ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'', ran a contest to determine the team name. Although the chosen name was "Mariners," the ''Pilot'''s editor overruled the contest, deciding he liked the alliteration of "Tidewater Tides."

The Tides spent their first year as an "independent" team with no direct major-league affiliation, but became a [[St. Louis Cardinals]] affiliate the following season. However, the South Atlantic League decided to pull out of Virginia in [[1963]], threatening the future of minor-league baseball in the [[Hampton Roads MSA|Hampton Roads]] area. A local group was able to convince the [[Carolina League]] to expand by two teams, one of them being the Tides.

In [[1969]], the Tides became a Triple-A team when the [[New York Mets]] moved their International League franchise from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to Portsmouth. The previous owners of the Tides continued to run the team under the Mets' ownership. Their first year in Triple-A ended with a pennant. At the same time, the Mets and the city of Norfolk cooperated to build the team's next home, [[Met Park]].

The Tides won the Governors' Cup, the International League championship, in [[1972]], [[1975]], [[1982]], [[1983]], and [[1985]]. They also had the league's best regular-season record in [[1987]], but lost in the playoffs. In [[1992]], ground was broken on the club's current home of Harbor Park, and the Tides moved into the new facility in [[1993]]. This period was a time of change in several other ways. First, in [[1992]], the Mets sold the franchise to a group led by [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] businessman Ken Young. At the time the Tides moved into Harbor Park, the team also replaced the "Tidewater" in its name with that of Norfolk, partly for marketing reasons and partly for political considerations, as the city of Norfolk had facilitated the financing and building of Harbor Park. Also in 1993, The Tides introduced their mascot Rip Tide.

The Mets and Tides ended their affiliation after the 2006 season. At the time, their 38-year association was the second longest in Triple-A, behind the [[Atlanta Braves |Atlanta]]-[[Richmond Braves |Richmond]] partnership, which dates to 1966. (The Braves have since moved the Richmond club to Gwinnett County.) The [[Baltimore Orioles]] announced their affiliation with the Tides in a press conference on September 25, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | last = Radford | first = Rich | title = ORIOLES HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR NORFOLK | work = The Virginian-Pilot | page = C1 | date = 2006-09-26}}</ref> The owner of the Tides also owns two other Orioles-affiliated minor-league clubs, the [[Bowie Baysox]] and the [[Frederick Keys]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Goldberg | first = Stan | title = Young is a hands-on owner | work = The Frederick News-Post | date = 2007-04-17 | url = http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?StoryID=59070 | accessdate = 2008-08-09}}</ref>
