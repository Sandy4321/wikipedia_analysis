'''"E<U+00B2>"''' is the seventy-third episode of the American [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the twenty-first episode of season three. It first aired on May 5, 2004, on the [[UPN]] network in the United States. The episode was the fifth of the [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 3)|season]] written by [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]], and it was directed by ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' alumni [[Roxann Dawson]], her fourth of the third season.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first [[Starfleet]] starship, ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', registration NX-01. Season three of ''Enterprise'' features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]]. In this episode, the ''Enterprise'' encounters a version of itself which was sent 117 years into the past and is now populated by the descendants of the crew and became a [[Generation ship|generational ship]]. The two crews have to work together to allow the modern ''Enterprise'' gain access to a wormhole which is defended by Xindi vessels.

The episode made use of the standing ''Enterprise'' sets, as well as those created for [[Degra]]'s ship. Guest stars included those who had previously appeared as members of the Xindi Council, as well as several who are new to ''Enterprise'', who appeared as members of the future ''Enterprise''. Most scenes were filmed between February 3 and February 11, 2004, with an additional special effect shoot on February 13. Reviewers compared "E<U+00B2>" to a number of several other episodes, including "[[Children of Time]]", "[[Deadlock (Star Trek: Voyager)|Deadlock]]" and "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]". The [[Nielsen ratings]] received by the episode equated to a 3.3/5% audience share.

==Plot==
Previously on ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' enters the Delphic Expanse after Earth is attacked by a prototype weapon sent by the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]]. They are a group of five surviving races who each evolved on the same planet. Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] ([[Scott Bakula]]) and the crew investigate the presence of a superweapon with which the Xindi intend to destroy Earth.

In "E<U+00B2>", the ''Enterprise'' is approaching a nebula containing a subspace corridor defended by Kovaalan vessels. Another version of ''Enterprise'' appears, captained by a man named Lorian ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) who explains that after fighting past the Xindi, the damaged ship will enter the corridor, causing it to travel 117 years into the past. Confronted with this situation, the crew turns it into a [[Generation ship|generational ship]] to await the Xindi crisis so as not to contaminate the time stream. Lorian reveals himself to be the son of Commander [[Charles Tucker III|Charles "Trip" Tucker III]] ([[Connor Trinneer]]) and Sub-commander [[T'Pol]] ([[Jolene Blalock]]), while Karyn Archer ([[Tess Lina]]) is the great-granddaughter of Captain Archer.

Jonathan Archer, T'Pol and Lorian meet with an elderly version of T'Pol onboard the future ''Enterprise''. Archer and Lorian disagree over whether to implement a modification to the normal ''Enterprise'', as it may cause the destruction of the ship. Lorian believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether, while Archer believes that his ship can pass through it without a repeat of the temporal disruption that sent her into the past, because of modifications suggested by the elder T'Pol. Lorian later meets with Karyn Archer and reveals that his plan is now to steal the plasma injectors from the normal ''Enterprise'' to allow the future version to travel at warp 6.9 and confront the Xindi in the place of their ancestors.

Lorian implements the plan and steals the parts, but the future ''Enterprise'' is disabled when the normal ''Enterprise'' fires upon it as it is about to go to warp. He is placed in Archer's brig, but the two come to an agreement and he is released. The two versions of T'Pol meet and discuss her addiction to Trelium-D and her relationship with Tucker. The current and future versions of the ''Enterprise'' enter the nebula but Archer's is quickly disabled. Lorian's ''Enterprise'' tows the other and throws it into the substance corridor using a [[tractor beam]], promising to follow shortly as it fires on the Kovaalan vessels. Archer and the crew wait for five hours, but the other ''Enterprise'' never emerges. He wonders if successfully traversing the corridor meant that Lorian and his ''Enterprise'' never existed, but T'Pol replies that if that was so then they wouldn't be able to remember them. Afterwards they rendezvous with [[Degra]] ([[Randy Oglesby]]), who is ready to escort them to the Xindi Council.

==Production==
The episode was the fifth to be written by [[Mike Sussman (TV series writer/producer)|Mike Sussman]] during the third season. His previous work was "[[Hatchery (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Hatchery]]", co-written with [[Andr<U+00E9> Bormanis]]. It was also the fourth episode of the season to be directed by ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' alumni [[Roxann Dawson]].

Filming began on February 3, 2004, overlapping with the final day of production on the previous episode, "[[The Forgotten (Star Trek: Enterprise)|The Forgotten]]".

The majority of the shoot was completed on February 11, but an additional day of special effects filming with part of the cast also took place on February 13. The actors who played the members of the Xindi council were amongst the guest stars who appeared in this episode; Randy Oglesby, [[Rick Worthy]] and [[Tucker Smallwood]].

Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for [[TrekNation]], saying that it "focused far more on the characters and the consequences of their contact with their descendants than it is on the vast technobabble resulting in a successful traverse of the Xindi corridor".<ref name=treknationreview>{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Michelle Erica|title=E<U+00B2>|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/enterprise/e2.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> She praised David Andrews as Lorian, calling it a "a wonderful bit of casting",<ref name=treknationreview/> and felt that the character's actions mirrored those of Captain Archer previously in the series. She compared the resolution of "E<U+00B2>" to the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "[[Deadlock (Star Trek: Voyager)|Deadlock]]" and the series finale of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]". She felt that the lack of conclusion to what happened to the future ''Enterprise'' was "very satisfying".<ref name=treknationreview/> Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website Jammer's Reviews, called the website an "acceptable but all-too-familiar time-travel concept" and a "step down" compared to the previous three episodes of the series.<ref name=jammer>{{cite web|last1=Epsicokhan|first1=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: Enterprise "E^2"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-ent/s3/e2.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> He compared it to the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Children of Time]]", which he said "was a far superior episode because it was about our characters <U+2014> astonishingly and agonizingly <U+2014> choosing one destiny over another, and sacrificing a great deal in coming to that decision."<ref name=jammer/> He gave "E<U+00B2>" a rating of two and a half out of four.<ref name=jammer/>
