'''Dengue fever''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8>d<U+025B><U+014B><U+0261>e<U+026A>|UK}}, {{IPA-en|<U+02C8>d<U+025B><U+014B><U+0261>i<U+02D0>|US}}), also known as '''breakbone fever''', is an infectious [[tropical disease]] caused by the [[dengue virus]]. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[myalgia|muscle]] and [[arthralgia|joint pains]], and a characteristic [[skin rash]] that is [[morbilliform|similar to measles]]. In a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening '''dengue hemorrhagic fever''', resulting in [[bleeding]], [[thrombocytopenia|low levels of blood platelets]] and blood plasma leakage, or into '''dengue shock syndrome''', where [[Shock (circulatory)|dangerously low blood pressure]] occurs.

Dengue is transmitted by several species of [[mosquito]] within the [[genus]] ''[[Aedes]]'', principally ''[[Aedes aegypti|A. aegypti]]''. The virus has four different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications.  As there is no [[vaccine]], prevention is sought by reducing the habitat and the number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites.

Treatment of acute dengue is supportive, using either oral or intravenous [[rehydration]] for mild or moderate disease, and [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and [[blood transfusion]] for more severe cases. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of dengue fever has increased dramatically since the 1960s, with around 50<U+2013>100&nbsp;million people infected yearly. Early descriptions of the condition date from 1779, and its viral cause and the transmission were elucidated in the early 20th century. Dengue has become a global problem since the [[World War II|Second World War]] and is [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in more than 110&nbsp;countries. Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing on a vaccine, as well as medication targeted directly at the virus.

===Clinical course===
The characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains, and a rash. The alternative name for dengue, "break-bone fever", comes from the associated muscle and joint pains.<ref name=White10/><ref name=Chen>{{cite journal|author=Chen LH, Wilson ME|title=Dengue and chikungunya infections in travelers|journal=Curr.

The febrile phase involves high fever, often over {{convert|40|C|F}}, and is associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days.<ref name=Chen/><ref name=WHOp25/> At this stage, a rash occurs in approximately 50<U+2013>80% of those with symptoms.<ref name=Chen/><ref name=Fitz2009>{{cite book|author=Wolff K, Johnson RA (eds.)|title=Fitzpatrick's color atlas and synopsis of clinical dermatology|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-159975-7|chapter=Viral infections of skin and mucosa|edition=6th|pages=810<U+2013>2}}</ref> It occurs in the first or second day of symptoms as [[erythema|flushed skin]], or later in the course of illness (days 4<U+2013>7), as a [[morbilliform|measles-like]] rash.<ref name=Fitz2009/><ref name=ER2010>{{cite book|author=Knoop KJ, Stack LB, Storrow A, Thurman RJ (eds.)|title=Atlas of emergency medicine|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=0-07-149618-1|chapter=Tropical medicine|edition=3rd | pages=658<U+2013>9}}</ref> Some [[petechia]]e (small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed, which are caused by broken [[capillary|capillaries]]) can appear at this point,<ref name=WHOp25/> as may some mild bleeding from the [[mucous membrane]]s of the mouth and nose.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Chen/> The fever itself is classically [[fever#Types|biphasic]] in nature, breaking and then returning for one or two days, although there is wide variation in how often this pattern actually happens.<ref name=ER2010/><ref name=Gould/>

In some people, the disease proceeds to a critical phase, which follows the resolution of the high fever and typically lasts one to two days.<ref name=WHOp25/> During this phase there may be significant fluid accumulation in the [[thoracic cavity|chest]] and [[abdominal cavity]] due to increased [[Vascular permeability|capillary permeability]] and leakage. This leads to [[hypovolemia|depletion of fluid from the circulation]] and [[hypoperfusion|decreased blood supply to vital organs]].<ref name=WHOp25/> During this phase, organ dysfunction and severe [[bleeding]], typically from the [[gastrointestinal tract]], may occur.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=WHOp25/> [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]] (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue,<ref name=Peads10/> however those who have previously been infected with other [[serotype]]s of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Life10/>

The recovery phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream.<ref name=WHOp25/> This usually lasts two to three days.<ref name=Peads10/> The improvement is often striking, but there may be severe [[itch]]ing and a [[Bradycardia|slow heart rate]].<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=WHOp25/> During this stage, a [[fluid overload]] state may occur; if it [[cerebral edema|affects the brain]], it may cause a [[altered level of consciousness|reduced level of consciousness]] or [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]].<ref name=Peads10/>

===Associated problems===
Dengue can occasionally affect several other [[biological system|body systems]],<ref name=WHOp25/> either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms.<ref name=India10/> A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5<U+2013>6% of severe cases, which is attributable either to [[encephalitis|infection of the brain by the virus]] or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs, for example, the [[hepatic encephalopathy|liver]].<ref name=India10/><ref name=Gould>{{cite journal|author=Gould EA, Solomon T|title=Pathogenic flaviviruses|journal=[[The Lancet]]|volume=371|issue=9611|pages=500<U+2013>9|year=2008|month=February|pmid=18262042|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60238-X}}</ref>

[[File:Dengue.jpg|thumb|alt=A transmission electron microscopy image showing dengue virus|A [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] [[micrograph]] showing dengue virus [[virion]]s (the cluster of dark dots near the center)]]

Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an [[RNA virus]] of the family ''[[Flaviviridae]]''; genus ''[[Flavivirus]]''. Other members of the same genus include [[yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], [[West Nile virus]], [[St. Louis encephalitis|St. Louis encephalitis virus]], [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]], [[tick-borne encephalitis virus]], [[Kyasanur forest disease|Kyasanur forest disease virus]], and [[Omsk hemorrhagic fever|Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus]].<ref name=Gould/> Most are transmitted by [[arthropod]]s (mosquitoes or [[tick]]s), and are therefore also referred to as [[arbovirus]]es (''ar''thropod-''bo''rne viruses).<ref name=Gould/>

The dengue virus [[genome]] (genetic material) contains about 11,000 [[nucleotide base]]s, which [[Genetic code|code]] for the three different types of protein molecules (C, prM and E) that form the [[Virion|virus particle]]  and seven other types of protein molecules (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) that are only found in infected host cells and are required for replication of the virus.<ref name=Life10>{{cite journal|author=Rodenhuis-Zybert IA, Wilschut J, Smit JM|title=Dengue virus life cycle: viral and host factors modulating infectivity|journal=Cell.

The severe complications on secondary infection occurs particularly if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 then contracts serotype DENV-2 or serotype DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to type DENV-3 then acquires DENV-2.<ref name=Guzman10/>

===Transmission===
[[File:Aedes aegypti biting human.jpg|alt=Close-up photograph of an ''Aedes aegypti'' mosquito biting human skin|thumb|The mosquito ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' feeding off a human host]]

Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by ''[[Aedes]]'' mosquitoes, particularly ''[[Aedes aegypti|A. aegypti]]''.<ref name=WHOp14>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;14<U+2013>16.</ref> These mosquitoes usually live between the [[latitude]]s of 35<U+00B0>&nbsp;North and 35<U+00B0>&nbsp;South below an [[elevation]] of {{convert|1000|m|ft}}.<ref name=WHOp14/> They bite primarily during the day.<ref name=WHOp59/> Other ''Aedes'' species that transmit the disease include ''[[Asian tiger mosquito|A. albopictus]]'', ''[[Aedes polynesiensis|A. polynesiensis]]'' and ''[[Aedes scutellaris|A. scutellaris]]''.<ref name=WHOp14/> Humans are the primary [[Host (biology)|host]] of the virus,<ref name=WHOp14/><ref name=Gould/> but it also circulates in nonhuman [[primate]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vector-borne viral infections|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/vector/en/index1.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 January 2011}}</ref> An infection can be acquired via a single bite.<ref name=Yellow10>{{cite web|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-5/dengue-fever-dengue-hemorrhagic-fever.aspx|title=Chapter 5 <U+2013> dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)|work=2010 Yellow Book|author=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2010-12-23}}</ref> A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8<U+2013>10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's [[salivary gland]]s and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. ''Aedes aegypti'' prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed off people rather than other vertebrates.<ref>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;377<U+2013>78.</ref>

===Predisposition===
Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in contrast to many other infections it is more common in children that are relatively well nourished.<ref name=Peads10/> Women are more at risk than men.<ref name=Guzman10/> Dengue can be life-threatening in people with [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[asthma]].<ref name=Guzman10/>

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]] (normal variations) in particular [[gene]]s have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF<U+03B1>]], [[mannan-binding lectin]],<ref name=White10/> [[CTLA4]], [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF<U+03B2>]],<ref name=Life10/> [[DC-SIGN]], and particular [[allele|forms]] of [[human leukocyte antigen]].<ref name=Guzman10/> A common genetic abnormality in Africans, known as [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]], appears to increase the risk.<ref name=Martina09>{{cite journal|author=Martina BE, Koraka P, Osterhaus AD|title=Dengue virus pathogenesis: an integrated view|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=22|issue=4|pages=564<U+2013>81|year=2009|month=October|pmid=19822889|pmc=2772360|doi=10.1128/CMR.00035-09|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/564}}</ref> Polymorphisms in the genes for the [[Calcitriol receptor|vitamin D receptor]] and [[Fc receptor#Fc-gamma receptors|Fc<U+03B3>R]] seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.<ref name=Guzman10/>

==Mechanism==
When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters [[white blood cell]]s, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as [[interferon]], which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the [[liver]] and the [[bone marrow]]) can be affected, and fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.<ref name=Martina09/>

===Viral replication===
Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to [[Langerhans cell]]s (a population of [[dendritic cell]]s in the skin that identifies pathogens).<ref name=Martina09/> The virus [[Receptor-mediated endocytosis|enters the cells]] through binding between viral proteins and [[membrane protein]]s on the Langerhans cell, specifically the [[C-type lectin]]s called DC-SIGN, [[mannose receptor]] and [[CLEC5A]].<ref name=Life10/> DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry.<ref name=Guzman10/> The dendritic cell moves to the nearest [[lymph node]]. Meanwhile, the virus genome is replicated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's [[endoplasmic reticulum]], where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins, and the viral RNA is copied. Immature virus particles are transported to the [[Golgi apparatus]], the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ([[glycoprotein]]s). The now mature new viruses bud on the surface of the infected cell and are released by [[exocytosis]]. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as [[monocyte]]s and [[macrophage]]s.<ref name=Life10/>

The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce [[interferon]], a [[cytokine]] that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the [[innate immune system]] by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the [[JAK-STAT signaling pathway|JAK-STAT pathway]]. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the [[adaptive immune system]], which leads to the generation of [[antibody|antibodies]] against the virus as well as [[T cell]]s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus.<ref name=Life10/> Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for [[phagocytosis]] (ingestion by [[phagocyte|specialized cells]] and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.<ref name=Life10/>

===Severe disease===
{{Further|Antibody-dependent enhancement}}
It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of [[antibody-dependent enhancement]] (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Life10/><ref name=Guzman10/> There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications,<ref name=White10/> and various lines of research have implied a role for [[T cell]]s and soluble factors such as [[cytokine]]s and the [[complement system]].<ref name=Martina09/>

Severe disease is marked by two problems: dysfunction of [[endothelium]] (the cells that line blood vessels) and disordered [[coagulation|blood clotting]].<ref name=India10/> Endothelial dysfunction leads to the leakage of fluid from the blood vessels into the chest and abdominal cavities, while coagulation disorder is responsible for the bleeding complications. Higher viral load in the blood and involvement of other organs (such as the [[bone marrow]] and the [[liver]]) are associated with more severe disease. Cells in the affected organs die, leading to the release of cytokines and activation of both coagulation and [[fibrinolysis]] (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation). These alterations together lead to both endothelial dysfunction and coagulation disorder.<ref name=Martina09/>

The diagnosis of dengue is typically made clinically, on the basis of reported symptoms and [[physical examination]]; this applies especially in endemic areas.<ref name=White10/> However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other [[viral infections]].<ref name=Peads10/> A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: [[nausea]] and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, [[Leukopenia|low white blood cell count]], positive [[tourniquet test]], or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] area.<ref name=WHOp10/> Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue.<ref name=WHOp25/> The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a [[Sphygmomanometer|blood pressure cuff]] for five minutes, followed by the counting of any [[petechial]] hemorrhages; a higher number makes a diagnosis of dengue more likely.<ref name=WHOp25/> It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and [[chikungunya]], a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue.<ref name=Chen/> Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as [[malaria]], [[leptospirosis]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[meningococcal disease]].<ref name=Peads10/>

The earliest change detectable on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count, which may then be followed by [[Thrombocytopenia|low platelets]] and [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref name=Peads10/> In severe disease, plasma leakage results in [[hemoconcentration]] (as indicated by a rising [[hematocrit]]) and [[hypoalbuminemia]].<ref name=Peads10/> [[Pleural effusion]]s or [[ascites]] can be detected by physical examination when large,<ref name=Peads10/> but the demonstration of fluid on [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome.<ref name=White10/><ref name=Peads10/> The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings.<ref name=White10/>

===Classification===
The [[World Health Organization]]'s 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups: uncomplicated and severe.<ref name=White10/><ref name=WHOp10>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> This replaces the 1997 WHO classification, which needed to be simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive, though the older classification is still widely used.<ref name=WHOp10/> The 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever.<ref name=Peads10>{{cite journal|author=Ranjit S, Kissoon N|title=Dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndromes|journal=Pediatr.

===Laboratory tests===
Dengue fever may be diagnosed by microbiological laboratory testing.<ref name=WHOp10/> This can be done by virus isolation in [[cell culture]]s, [[Nucleic acid test|nucleic acid detection]] by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], viral [[antigen]] detection or specific [[antibodies]] (serology).<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=WHOp90>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>95.</ref> Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost.<ref name=WHOp90/> All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease.<ref name=Peads10/><ref name=Guzman10/>

These laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types [[IgG]] and [[IgM]], can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5<U+2013>7 days. The highest levels ([[titre]]s) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in secondary and tertiary infections. The IgM becomes undetectable 30<U+2013>90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection the IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14<U+2013>21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In the laboratory test the IgG and the IgM antibodies can cross-react with other flaviviruses, such as [[yellow fever|yellow fever virus]], which can make the interpretation of the serology difficult.<ref name=Chen/><ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=Gubler10/> The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.<ref name=Gubler10>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], p.&nbsp;380.</ref>

==Prevention==
[[File:Vector Control.jpg|alt=A black and white photograph of people filling in a ditch with standing water|thumb|A 1920s photograph of efforts to disperse standing water and thus decrease mosquito populations]]

There are no approved [[vaccine]]s for the dengue virus.<ref name=White10/> Prevention thus depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it.<ref name=WHOp59>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;59<U+2013>60.</ref><ref name=WHOp137>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;137.</ref> The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements: (1)&nbsp;Advocacy, social mobilization and legislation to ensure that public health bodies and communities are strengthened, (2)&nbsp;collaboration between the health and other sectors (public and private), (3)&nbsp;an integrated approach to disease control to maximize use of resources, (4)&nbsp;evidence-based decision making to ensure any interventions are targeted appropriately and (5)&nbsp;capacity-building to ensure an adequate response to the local situation.<ref name=WHOp59/>

The primary method of controlling ''A. aegypti'' is by eliminating its [[habitat]]s.<ref name=WHOp59/> This is done by emptying containers of water or by adding [[insecticide]]s or [[biological control agent]]s to these areas,<ref name=WHOp59/> although spraying with [[organophosphate]] or [[pyrethroid]] insecticides is not thought to be effective.<ref name=Euro10/> Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effect from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents.<ref name=WHOp59/> People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using [[mosquito net]]ting while resting, and/or the application of [[insect repellent]] ([[DEET]] being the most effective).<ref name=Yellow10/>

==Management==
There are no specific treatments for dengue fever.<ref name=White10/> Treatment depends on the symptoms, varying from [[oral rehydration therapy]] at home with close follow-up, to hospital admission with administration of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluids]] and/or [[blood transfusion]].<ref name=WHOp32>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;32<U+2013>37.</ref> A decision for hospital admission is typically based on the presence of the "warning signs" listed in the table above, especially in those with preexisting health conditions.<ref name=Peads10/>

Intravenous hydration is usually only needed for one or two days.<ref name=WHOp32/> The rate of fluid administration is titrated to a [[Urination|urinary output]] of 0.5<U+2013>1&nbsp;mL/kg/hr, stable [[vital signs]] and normalization of [[hematocrit]].<ref name=Peads10/> Invasive medical procedures such as [[nasogastric intubation]], [[intramuscular injection]]s and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk.<ref name=Peads10/> [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while [[NSAIDs]] such as [[ibuprofen]] and [[aspirin]] are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding.<ref name=WHOp32/> Blood transfusion is initiated early in patients presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a ''decreasing hematocrit'', rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined "transfusion trigger" level.<ref name=WHOp40>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;40<U+2013>43.</ref> [[Packed red blood cells]] or [[whole blood]] are recommended, while [[platelet]]s and [[fresh frozen plasma]] are usually not.<ref name=WHOp40/>

During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]].<ref name=Peads10/> If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed.<ref name=WHOp40/> If a person is outside of the critical phase, a [[loop diuretic]] such as [[furosemide]] may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.<ref name=WHOp40/>

The most common viral disease transmitted by [[arthropod]]s,<ref name=Life10/> dengue has a [[disease burden]] estimated to be 1600 [[disability-adjusted life year]]s per million population, which is similar to other childhood and tropical diseases such as [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=Guzman10/>  As a tropical disease dengue is deemed only second in importance to [[malaria]],<ref name=Peads10/> though the World Health Organization counts dengue as one of sixteen [[neglected diseases|neglected tropical diseases]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Neglected Tropical Diseases|url=http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/|title=Diseases covered by NTD department|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref>

The incidence of dengue increased 30&nbsp;fold between 1960 and 2010.<ref name=WHOp3>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref> This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and [[global warming]].<ref name=White10/> The geographical distribution is around the equator with 70% of the total 2.5&nbsp;billion people living in endemic areas from Asia and the Pacific.<ref name=WHOp3/> In the United States, the rate of dengue infection among those who return from an endemic area with a fever is 2.9<U+2013>8.0%,<ref name=Yellow10/> and it is the second most common infection after malaria to be diagnosed in this group.<ref name=Chen/>

Until 2003, dengue was classified as a potential [[bioterrorism]] agent, but subsequent reports removed this classification as it was deemed too difficult to transfer and only caused [[hemorrhagic fever]] in a relatively small proportion of people.<ref name=Barrett09/>

Like most arboviruses, dengue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are maintained in the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female ''Aedes'' mosquitoes<U+2014>of species other than ''A. aegypti''<U+2014>to her offspring and to lower primates. In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by ''A. aegypti'' and other species of ''Aedes'' such as ''[[Aedes albopictus|A. albopictus]]''. In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted to humans by ''A. aegypti'', which is highly domesticated. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating  dengue viruses. This is called amplification.<ref>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;376.</ref> The urban cycle is the most important to infections of humans and dengue infections are primarily confined to towns and cities.<ref name=Gubler377>[[#refGubler2010|Gubler (2010)]], pp.&nbsp;377.</ref> In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in endemic areas, and the increased mobility of humans has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America,<ref name=Gubler377/> and might pose a threat to Europe.<ref name=Euro10/>

==History==
The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the [[Jin Dynasty (265<U+2013>420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265<U+2013>420&nbsp;AD) which referred to a "water poison" associated with flying insects.<ref name=EID06/><ref name=Gubler98>{{cite journal|author=Gubler DJ|title=Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=11|issue=3|pages=480<U+2013>96|year=1998|month=July|pmid=9665979|pmc=88892|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/11/3/480}}</ref> There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780, when an epidemic swept Asia, Africa and North America.<ref name=Gubler98/> From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent.<ref name=Gubler98/>

In 1906, transmission by the ''Aedes'' mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after [[yellow fever]]) that was shown to be caused by a virus.<ref name=Henchal>{{cite journal|author=Henchal EA, Putnak JR|title=The dengue viruses|journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev.|volume=3|issue=4|pages=376<U+2013>96|year=1990|month=October|pmid=2224837|pmc=358169|url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/3/4/376|doi=10.1128/CMR.3.4.376}}</ref> Further investigations by [[John Burton Cleland]] and [[Joseph Franklin Siler]] completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.<ref name=Henchal/>

The marked spread of dengue during and after the [[World War II|Second World War]] has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the [[Philippines]] in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of [[child mortality]] and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas.<ref name=Gubler98/> Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.<ref name=Gould/>

===Etymology===
The origins of the word "dengue" are not clear, but one theory is that it is derived from the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] phrase ''Ka-dinga pepo'', which describes the disease as being caused by an [[evil spirit]].<ref name=EID06/> The Swahili word ''dinga'' may possibly have its origin in the Spanish word ''dengue'', meaning fastidious or careful, which would describe the gait of a person suffering the bone pain of dengue fever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dengue|title=Etymology: dengue|year=2001|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|author=Harper D|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> However, it is possible that the use of the Spanish word derived from the similar-sounding Swahili.<ref name=EID06>{{cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Etymologia: dengue|journal=Emerg.

Dis.|year=2006|volume=12|page=893|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no06/pdfs/etymology.pdf|issue=6}}</ref> Slaves in the West Indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a [[dandy]], and the disease was known as "dandy fever".<ref>{{cite web|author=Anonymous|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6620|title=Definition of Dandy fever|work=MedicineNet.com|date=1998-06-15|accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref><ref name=Hal08>{{cite book|author=Halstead SB|title=Dengue (Tropical Medicine: Science and Practice)|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=River Edge, N.J|year=2008|pages=1<U+2013>10|isbn=1-84816-228-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6zLd9mFwxwsC&pg=PA1}}</ref>

The term "break-bone fever" was first applied by physician and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] [[Benjamin Rush]], in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in [[Philadelphia]]. In the report he uses primarily the more formal term "bilious remitting fever".<ref name=Barrett09/><ref>{{cite book|author=Rush AB|year=1789|chapter=An account of the bilious remitting fever, as it appeared in Philadelphia in the summer and autumn of the year 1780|title=Medical enquiries and observations|pages=104<U+2013>117|publisher=Prichard and Hall|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> The term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828.<ref name=Hal08/> Other historical terms include "breakheart fever" and "la dengue".<ref name=Hal08/> Terms for severe disease include "infectious thrombocytopenic purpura" and "Philippine", "Thai", or "Singapore hemorrhagic fever".<ref name=Hal08/>

Research efforts to prevent and treat dengue include various means of vector control,<ref name=WHOp71>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]], p.&nbsp;71.</ref> vaccine development, and [[antiviral drug]]s.<ref name=WHOp137>[[#refWHO2009|WHO (2009)]] p. 137<U+2013>146.</ref>

With regards to vector control, a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'') or [[copepods]] in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae.<ref name=WHOp71/> Research is also being done by genetically modifying mosquitoes such that females' flight muscles fail to develop, leaving them unable to fly once emerging from the pupal stage.  The lack of females in the breeding population leads to a population crash.<ref>Trivedi, Bijal P. ''The Wipeout  Gene'', [[Scientific American]] p. 70-5. November 2011</ref>

There are ongoing programs working on a dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes.<ref name=WHOp137/> One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement.<ref name=Webster>{{cite journal|author=Webster DP, Farrar J, Rowland-Jones S|title=Progress towards a dengue vaccine|journal=Lancet Infect Dis|volume=9|issue=11|pages=678<U+2013>87|year=2009|month=November|pmid=19850226|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(09)70254-3}}</ref> The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.<ref name=Webster/> As of 2009, a number of vaccines were undergoing testing.<ref name=Guzman10/><ref name=Barrett09>{{cite book|author=Barrett AD, Stanberry LR|title=Vaccines for biodefense and emerging and neglected diseases|publisher=Academic|location=San Diego|year=2009|pages=287<U+2013>323|isbn=0-12-369408-6|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6Nu058ZNa1MC&pg=PA289}}</ref><ref name=Webster/>  It is hoped that the first products will be commercially available by 2015.<ref name=WHOp137/>

Apart from attempts to control the spread of the ''Aedes'' mosquito and work to develop a vaccine against dengue, there are ongoing efforts to develop [[antiviral drug]]s that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications.<ref name=Sampath>{{cite journal|author=Sampath A, Padmanabhan R|title=Molecular targets for flavivirus drug discovery|journal=Antiviral Res.|volume=81|issue=1|pages=6<U+2013>15|year=2009|month=January|pmid=18796313|pmc=2647018|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.08.004}}</ref><ref name=Noble>{{cite journal|author=Noble CG, Chen YL, Dong H, ''et al.''|title=Strategies for development of Dengue virus inhibitors|journal=Antiviral Res.|volume=85|issue=3|pages=450<U+2013>62|year=2010|month=March|pmid=20060421|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.12.011}}</ref> Discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs.<ref name=Noble/> There are several plausible targets.
