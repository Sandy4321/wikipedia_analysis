'''''De Materia Medica''''' is an [[encyclopaedia]] and [[pharmacopoeia]] of [[herbs]] and the [[medicine]]s that can be obtained from them. The five-volume work describes many drugs known to be effective, including [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[bitter apple]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], [[opium]] and [[squill]]. In all, about 600 plants are covered, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from them.

The work was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all [[natural history]] books.

''De Materia Medica'' was circulated as illustrated manuscripts, copied by hand, in Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the [[mediaeval]] period. From the sixteenth century on, it was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English, forming the basis for [[herbal]]s in these languages by men such as [[Leonhart Fuchs]], [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Matthias de Lobel|Lobelius]], [[Rembert Dodoens]], [[Carolus Clusius]], [[John Gerard]] and [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]]. Gradually such herbals included more and more direct observations, eventually supplanting the classical text.

Several manuscripts and early printed versions of ''De Materia Medica'' survive, including the illustrated [[Vienna Dioscurides]] manuscript from sixth century [[Constantinople]].

Between 50 and 70 AD, [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]] wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, {{lang|grc|<U+03A0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+1F76> <U+1F55><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+1F30><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+1FC6><U+03C2>}} ''Peri hules iatrik<U+0113>s'', known more widely by its Latin title ''De Materia Medica'' ("On Medical Materials") which became the precursor to all modern [[pharmacopoeia]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_dioscorides.html | title=Greek Medicine | publisher=National Institutes of Health, USA | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>

In contrast to many classical authors, ''De Materia Medica'' was not "rediscovered" in the Renaissance, because it never left circulation; indeed, Dioscorides' text eclipsed the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic corpus]].<ref name="Vos 2010">De Vos (2010) "European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use", ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' 132(1):28<U+2013>47</ref> In the medieval period, ''De Materia Medica'' was circulated in Latin, Greek, and Arabic.<ref>Some detail about medieval manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' at [http://www.ibidispress.scriptmania.com/custom.html Ibidis Press]</ref> In the [[Renaissance]] from 1478 onwards, it was printed in Italian, German, Spanish, and French as well.<ref name=Boas47>Boas, 1962. p47</ref> In 1655, John Goodyer made an English translation from a printed version, probably not corrected from the Greek.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.panaceavera.com/demateriaindex.html | title=De Materia Medica (by) Pedanius Dioscorides | publisher=Ibidis | work=Preface | date=2000 | accessdate=22 May 2014 | author=Osbaldeston, Tess Anne}}</ref>

While being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, the text was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Several illustrated manuscripts of ''De Materia Medica'' survive. The most famous of these is the lavishly illustrated [[Vienna Dioscurides]], produced in Constantinople in 512/513 AD; the [[Naples Dioscurides]] and [[Morgan Dioscurides]] are somewhat later manuscripts in Greek, while Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kt9DIY1g9HYC&pg=PA1077&lpg=PA1077&dq=dioscorides+%22mount+athos | title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures | publisher=Springer | author=Selin, Helaine | year=2008 | page=1077}}</ref>

''De Materia Medica'' is the prime historical source of information about the medicines used by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the [[Dacian language|Dacian]]<ref>{{cite book | author=Nutton, Vivian | title=Ancient Medicine | publisher=Routledge | year=2004 | page=177}}</ref> names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources.<ref name=Krebs>{{cite book | last=Krebs | first=Robert E. | first2=Carolyn A. | last2=Krebs | title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the Ancient World | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | year=2003 | pages=75<U+2013>76}}</ref><ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, page xx</ref> Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.<ref>Sutton, 2007. p35</ref>

==Approach==

Each entry gives a substantial amount of detail on the plant or substance in question, concentrating on medicinal uses but giving such mention of other uses (such as culinary) and help with recognition as considered necessary. For example, on the "Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros", the opium poppy and related species, Dioscorides states that the seed of one is made into bread: it has "a somewhat long little head and white seed",<ref name=poppy>Osbaldeston, 2000. pp607<U+2013>611</ref> while another "has a head bending down"<ref name=poppy/> and a third is "more wild, more medicinal and longer than these, with a head somewhat long <U+2014> and they are all cooling."<ref name=poppy/> After this brief description, he moves at once into pharmacology, saying that they cause sleep; other uses are to treat inflammation and [[erysipela]], and if boiled with honey to make a cough mixture. The account thus combines recognition, pharmacological effect, and guidance on drug preparation. Its effects are summarized, accompanied by a caution:<ref name=poppy/>

{{quote|A little of it (taken with as much as a grain of ervum) is a pain-easer, a sleep-causer, and a digester, helping coughs and abdominal cavity afflictions. Taken as a drink too often it hurts (making men lethargic) and it kills. It is helpful for aches, sprinkled on with rosaceum; and for pain in the ears dropped in them with oil of almonds, saffron, and myrrh. For inflammation of the eyes it is used with a roasted egg yolk and saffron, and for erysipela and
wounds with vinegar; but for gout with women's milk and saffron. Put up with the finger as a suppository it causes sleep.|Dioscorides<U+2014>Mekon Agrios and Mekon Emeros<ref name=poppy/>}}

Dioscorides then describes how to tell a good from a counterfeit preparation. He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends with a description of how the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: ''chamaesyce'', ''mecon'' ''rhoeas'', ''oxytonon''; ''papaver'' to the Romans, and ''wanti'' to the Egyptians.<ref name=poppy/>

As late as in the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]]s in Britain, herbals often still classified plants in the same way as Dioscorides and other classical authors, not by their structure or apparent relatedness but by how they smelt and tasted, whether they were edible, and what medicinal uses they had.<ref>{{cite book | title=Man and the Natural World | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Thomas, Keith | year=1983 | pages=52<U+2013>53 | isbn=0-7139-1227-8}}</ref> Only when European botanists like [[Matthias de l'Obel]], [[Andrea Cesalpino]] and [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]] (Bachmann) had done their best to match plants they knew to those listed in Dioscorides did they go further and create new [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification systems]] based on similarity of parts, whether leaves, fruits, or flowers.<ref>{{cite book | title=Man and the Natural World | publisher=Allen Lane | author=Thomas, Keith | year=1983 | page=65 | isbn=0-7139-1227-8}}</ref>

==Contents==

The book is divided into five volumes. Dioscorides organized the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is by the type of effect on the human body.<ref>Sutton, 2007. p34</ref>

===Volume I: Aromatics===

Volume I covers aromatic oils, the plants that provide them, and ointments made from them. They include what are probably [[cardamom]], [[Spikenard|nard]], [[valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[cassia bark|cassia]] or [[senna (plant)|senna]], [[cinnamon]], [[balm of Gilead]], [[hops]], [[mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], [[turpentine]],  [[pine]] resin, [[bitumen]], [[Erica|heather]], [[quince]], [[apple]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[lemon]], [[pear]], [[medlar]], [[plum]] and many others.<ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 1.</ref>

===Volume II: Animals to herbs===

Volume II covers an assortment of topics: animals including sea creatures such as [[sea urchin]], [[seahorse]], [[whelk]], [[mussel]], [[crab]], [[scorpion]], [[electric ray]], [[viper]], [[cuttlefish]] and many others; dairy produce; [[cereals]]; vegetables such as [[sea kale]], [[beetroot]], [[asparagus]]; and sharp herbs such as [[garlic]], [[leek]], [[onion]], [[caper]] and [[mustard plant|mustard]].<ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 2.</ref>

===Volume III: Roots, seeds and herbs===

Volume III covers roots, seeds and herbs. These include plants that may be [[rhubarb]], [[gentian]], [[liquorice]], [[caraway]], [[cumin]], [[parsley]], [[lovage]], [[fennel]] and many others.<ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 3.</ref>

===Volume IV: Roots and herbs, continued===

Volume IV describes further roots and herbs not covered in Volume III. These include herbs that may be [[betony]], [[Polygonatum|Solomon's seal]], [[clematis]], [[horsetail]] and many others.<ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 4.</ref>

===Volume V: Vines, wines and minerals===

Volume V covers the grapevine, wine made from it, grapes and raisins; but also strong medicinal potions made by boiling many other plants including [[mandrake (plant)|mandrake]], [[hellebore]], and various metal compounds, such as what may be [[zinc oxide]], [[verdigris]] and [[iron oxide]].<ref>Osbaldeston, 2000. Suggested translations in Book 5.</ref>

==Influence and effectiveness==

Writing in ''The Great Naturalists'', the [[history of science|historian of science]] David Sutton describes ''De Materia Medica'' as "one of the most enduring works of natural history ever written"<ref name=Sutton33>Sutton, 2007. p33</ref> and that "it formed the basis for Western knowledge of medicines for the next 1,500 years."<ref name=Sutton33/> Along with his fellow physicians of Ancient Rome, [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]], [[Galen]], [[Hippocrates]] and [[Soranus of Ephesus]], Dioscorides also had a major and long-lasting effect on [[Arabic medicine]] as well as medical practice across Europe.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Saad, Bashar |author2=Azaizeh, Hassan |author3=Said, Omar  | title=Tradition and Perspectives of Arab Herbal Medicine: A Review | journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | date=1 January 2005 | volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=475<U+2013>479 | doi=10.1093/ecam/neh133|pmid=16322804 | pmc=1297506}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.es.flinders.edu.au/~mattom/science+society/lectures/lecture11.html | author=Tomczak, Matthias | title=Lecture 11: Science, technology and medicine in the Roman Empire | work=Science, Civilization and Society (Lecture series) | date=2004 (updated 15 December 2008) | accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>

Historian of science [[Marie Boas]] writes that herbalists depended entirely on Dioscorides and Theophrastus until the sixteenth century, when they finally realized they could work on their own.<ref name=Boas47/> She notes also that [[herbal]]s by different authors, such as [[Leonhart Fuchs]], [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Matthias de Lobel|Lobelius]], [[Rembert Dodoens]], [[Carolus Clusius]], [[John Gerard]] and [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]], were dominated by Dioscorides, his influence only gradually weakening as the sixteenth century herbalists "learned to add and substitute their own observations".<ref>Boas, 1962. pp49<U+2013>50</ref>

Paula Findlen, writing in the ''Cambridge History of Science'', calls ''De Materia Medica'' "one of the most successful and enduring herbals of antiquity, [which] emphasized the importance of understanding the natural world in light of its medicinal efficiency", in contrast to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (which emphasized the wonders of nature) or the [[natural history]] studies of [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]] (which emphasized the causes of natural phenomena).<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2kvjAp92zcY | work=The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 3, Early Modern Science | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Findlen, Paula; edited by Roy Porter, Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston | year=2006 | page=438 | title=Natural History}}</ref>

Vivian Nutton, in ''Ancient Medicine'', writes that Dioscorides's "five books in Greek On Materia medica attained canonical status in Late Antiquity." <ref>Nutton, p174</ref>

Brian Ogilvie calls Dioscorides "the greatest ancient herbalist", and ''De Materia Medica'' "the ''summa'' of ancient descriptive botany", observing that its success was such that few other books in his domain have survived from classical times.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f8FmrXT1jdIC | title=The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Ogilvie, Brian W | year=2008 | page=96}}</ref> Further, his approach matched the Renaissance liking for detailed description, unlike the philosophical search for essential nature (as in Theophrastus's ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]''). A critical moment was the decision by [[Niccol<U+00F2> Leoniceno]] and others to use Dioscorides "as the model of the careful naturalist<U+2014>and his book ''De Materia Medica'' as the model for natural history."<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f8FmrXT1jdIC | title=The Science of Describing: Natural History in Renaissance Europe | publisher=University of Chicago Press | author=Ogilvie, Brian W | year=2008 | pages=137<U+2013>138}}</ref>

The Dioscorides translator and editor Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that "For almost two millenia Dioscorides was regarded as the ultimate authority on plants and medicine",<ref name=Osbaldestonxxi>Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, pages xxi<U+2013>xxii</ref> and that he "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully."<ref name=Osbaldestonxxi/> To illustrate this, she states that "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[bitter apple]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], and [[squill]]".<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv>Osbaldeston, 2000. Introduction, pages xxv<U+2013>xxvi</ref> The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to [[aspirin]], she writes), [[autumn crocus]] and [[opium]], which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and [[emollients]]&nbsp;... [such as] [[ammoniacum]], [[anise]], [[cardamom]]s, [[catechu]], [[cinnamon]], [[colocynth]], [[coriander]], [[crocus]], [[dill]], [[fennel]], [[galbanum]], [[gentian]], [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]], [[hyoscyamus]], [[lavender]], [[linseed]], mastic, [[male fern]], [[marjoram]], [[marshmallow]], [[mezereon]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[myrrh]], [[orris]] (iris), [[oak gall]]s, [[olive oil]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[peppermint]], [[poppy]], [[psyllium]], [[rhubarb]], [[rosemary]], [[rue]], [[saffron]], [[sesame]], squirting cucumber ([[elaterium]]), [[starch]], stavesacre ([[delphinium]]), [[storax]], [[stramonium]], [[sugar]], [[terebinth]], [[thyme]], [[Veratrum album|white hellebore]], [[white horehound]], and [[couch grass]] <U+2014> the last still used as a [[demulcent]] [[diuretic]]."<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/> She notes that medicines such as [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]], [[juniper]], [[ginger]], and [[calamine]] also remain in use, while "[[Chinese medicine|Chinese]] and [[Ayurveda|Indian physicians]] continue to use [[liquorice]]".<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/> She explains that the many drugs listed to reduce the [[spleen]] may be explained by the frequency of [[malaria]] in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause [[abortion]] and to treat [[urinary tract infection]]; [[palliative]]s for [[toothache]], such as [[colocynth]], and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases.<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/> As well as these useful substances, she observes that "A few [[Superstition|superstitious practices]] are recorded in ''De Materia Medica'',"<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/> such as using ''[[Echium]]'' as an [[amulet]] to ward off snakes, or ''Polemonia'' ([[Jacob's ladder]]) for [[scorpion]] stings.<ref name=Osbaldestonxxv/>

In the view of historian Paula De Vos, ''De Materia Medica'' formed the core of the European pharmacopoeia until the end of the 19th century, suggesting that "the timelessness of Dioscorides' work resulted from an [[empiricism|empirical tradition]] based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory".<ref name="Vos 2010">{{cite journal | author=De Vos, Paula | year=2010 | title=European Materia Medica in Historical Texts: Longevity of a Tradition and Implications for Future Use | journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume=132 | issue=1 | pages=28<U+2013>47}}</ref>
