[[Image:Rightonred.JPG|thumb|Turning right on red is forbidden in [[New York City]] unless one encounters this sign or similar.<!--In Broad Channel, there are similar signs for left turns.--> In the United States outside New York City, right turns are permitted on red (except for school buses and trucks carrying [[dangerous goods|hazardous materials]]) unless there is a "No Turn on Red" or "Right Turn Signal" sign or unless there is a red arrow light indicating the same and controlling the right turn.]]

'''Right turn on red''', or simply '''right on red''', is a principle of law permitting vehicles at a [[traffic light]] showing a red signal to turn right (almost always after a complete stop) when the way is clear, in a country with [[right-hand traffic]].  It is intended to allow traffic to resume moving, with minimal risk provided that proper caution is observed.

==North America==
Right turns on red are permitted in many regions of North America. Western [[United States|states]] have allowed it for more than 50 years;{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel-saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]. All 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], and [[Puerto Rico]] have allowed right turns on red since 1 January 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by  dedicated [[traffic lights]]. The one exception in the United States{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} is within [[New York City]], where right turns on red are prohibited unless a sign indicates otherwise. 

At intersections where [[U-turn]]s are permitted and controlled by an arrow from the left-most lane, motorists turning right on red onto the same road must yield to those making U-turns before turning, as the motorists making U-turns have the [[right-of-way (traffic)|right of way]] and a [[traffic collision|collision]] could easily occur. At intersections where U-turns are prohibited in the same fashion, a green right turn arrow will sometimes appear with the red light for those turning right onto the road, allowing only traffic turning right to proceed without having to stop or yield to other vehicles. Some states such as [[California]] have "No U-Turn" signs posted at these intersections because of the green right turn arrow.

In some states, such as New York, a right turn on red is prohibited when a red arrow is present.<ref name="NYS DMV Driver's Manual - Chapter 4">[http://dmv.ny.gov/dmanual/chapter04-manual.htm#tra-sig New York State Driver's Manual], Chapter 4.</ref> Most [[Caribbean]] countries with [[Right- and left-hand traffic|right-hand traffic]], such as the [[Dominican Republic]], allow right turn on red unless a sign prohibits it. Some vehicles, such as those carrying [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] and [[school buses]], are not allowed to turn on red under any circumstance and must wait for a green light or arrow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

During 1982<U+2013>1992, approximately 84 fatal crashes per year occurred in the U.S. where a vehicle was turning right at intersections where right turn on red was permitted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} As of 1992, right turn on red is governed federally by {{UnitedStatesCode|42|6322}}(c) ("Each proposed State energy conservation plan to be eligible for Federal assistance under this part shall include: ...(5) a traffic law or regulation which, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with safety, permits the operator of a motor vehicle to turn such vehicle right at a red stop light after stopping, and to turn such vehicle left from a one-way street onto a one-way street at a red light after stopping."). All turns on red are forbidden in [[New York City]] unless a sign is posted permitting it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/ssi09_projects/ssi09_rightonred.pdf |title=Right Turn on Red |publisher=nyc.com |format=PDF |accessdate=22 January 2010 }}</ref> This law has been protested but not overturned.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Throughout most of [[Canada]], a driver may turn right at a red light after coming to a complete stop unless a sign indicates otherwise. In the province of [[Quebec]], turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red manoeuvre did not result in significantly more accidents. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, owing to locally specific safety concerns,{{vague|date=October 2012}} it remains illegal to turn right on a red anywhere on the [[Island of Montreal]].<ref>[http://www.mtq.gouv.qc.ca/portal/page/portal/grand_public_en/vehicules_promenade/reseau_routier/signalisation/virage_droite_feu_rouge mtq.gouv.qc.ca]</ref> Motorists are reminded of this by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges.

In [[Mexico]], right turns on red are generally prohibited unless a sign indicates otherwise, and motorists can be issued a citation for noncompliance.<ref name="CBRD - Introduction to driving in Mexico">[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/international/mexico/introduction.shtml cbrd.co.uk]</ref> However, right turns on red are allowed in [[Mexico City]].<ref name="Reglamento de Tr<U+00E1>nsito del D.F.

==South America==
[[Image:Chile RA-2.svg|thumb|150px|right|[[Chile]]an right turn on red permitted sign]]
In [[Chile]], right turns on red are only allowed when a sign permitting it is shown.

==Europe==
[[Image:Zeichen 720.svg|thumb|200px|left|[[Germany|German]] Right turn on red permission sign]]

In [[European Union]] member states in general, it is illegal to turn on a red light, unless it is indicated otherwise, for example by a green arrow on a red light, a flashing amber arrow with a red light or a permanent green board next to the red light.

In [[Poland]], right turns on red are permitted, after a complete stop, when a specific sign is present.

In [[Germany]], right turns on red are permitted, after a complete stop, when a specific sign is present. This rule was first introduced in 1978 in [[East Germany]] and was originally supposed to become obsolete together with the East German highway code by the end of 1990, following [[German reunification]]. However, authorities were unable to remove the signs in time, and public opinion caused them to leave the regulation unchanged, even extending its scope to the former areas of [[West Germany]] in 1994. By 1999, there were 300 turn-on-red intersections in West Germany while East Germany featured 2,500; the numbers in West Germany have risen considerably since then, though, and as of 2002 a total of 5,000 turn-on-red intersections were counted, with 48% in West Germany.

In [[Russia]], which drives on the right as do most countries in Europe, turns on red are prohibited unless a separate arrow-shaped green light allows it; drivers must give way to any vehicle coming from a different direction. When the arrow is not lit, turns in any directions are permitted on the main green light unless its prohibited by roadsigns.
[[Image:Feux avec passage.svg|thumb|200px|[[France|French]] Right turn (or others) on red permission sign]]

In the [[Netherlands]], bicycles are occasionally allowed to turn right on a red light. Wherever this is the case, a sign "''rechtsaf voor fietsers vrij''" (right turn free for cyclists) or "''rechtsaf voor (brom)fietsers vrij''" (right turn free for cyclists and mopeds) is present. In practice, especially in large cities such as [[Amsterdam]], cyclists rarely stop for traffic lights on right turns even if there is no sign.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In [[France]] right turn on red without stop is allowed when a separate arrow-shaped yellow light is flashing, but this color means drivers do not have priority.  They must check if any pedestrian is crossing before turning and must give way to possible vehicle coming from another way.

Like in the Netherlands, France has a road sign that allows cyclists to turn right on a red light.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trotignon|first=Jean-Michel|title=Tourne <U+00E0> droite au feu rouge: il manque juste le panneau|url=http://www.fubicy.org/IMG/pdf/VC109_PANNEAU_TOURNE_A_DROITE.pdf|work=V<U+00E9>locit<U+00E9>|publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration fran<U+00E7>aise des Usagers de la Bicyclette|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] Parliament considered erecting road signs that would allow cyclists to turn right on a red light.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fietsers binnenkort door rood?|url=http://m.standaard.be/artikel.xhtml?contentID=1816155|work=De Standaard|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=/flwb&language=nl&rightmenu=right&cfm=flwbn.cfm?lang=N&legislat=53&dossierID=1004|title=Wetsvoorstel tot wijziging van het koninklijk besluit van 1 december 1975 houdende algemeen reglement op de politie van het wegverkeer en van het gebruik van de openbare weg teneinde de fietsers toe te staan in bepaalde gevallen de verkeerslichten voorbij te rijden |publisher=dekamer.be |work=Belgische kamer van volksvertegenwoordigers}}</ref>

In the [[United Kingdom]], left turn on red is generally prohibited, but at some junctions there is a separate arrow-shaped green light which, when lit, allows left-hand turns.

==Asia==
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
As in the United Kingdom, left turn on red is always prohibited in [[Hong Kong]]. At some junctions, however, there may be separate sets of signals for left turns, or specific lanes for turning left separating from the through traffic by [[traffic island]]s and [[give way sign]]s are installed. One such example is at the junction of [[Queen's Road East]] and [[Morrison Hill Road]].

In [[China]], right turn on red is permitted, unless there is a red arrow pointing to the right.

In [[India]], which drives on the left, a "Free left turn" is allowed unless there is a sign prohibiting it ("No free left (turn)").<ref>[http://delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/traffic-light.htm delhitrafficpolice.nic.in]</ref> In certain places an explicit sign also guides drivers to take a "free left" turn.

In [[Japan]], which drives on the left, the only left turn allowed requires a green left arrow along with the red light.

[[File:Singapore Road Signs - Information Sign - Left Turn On Red.svg|thumb|200px|Singapore "Left Turn On Red" sign]]
In [[Singapore]], which drives on the left, left turn on red is allowed only when the "Left Turn On Red" sign is displayed at the traffic junction. The driver will have to stop at the red light first and give way to pedestrians and oncoming vehicles from their right before turning.<ref>[http://www.onemotoring.com.sg/publish/onemotoring/en/on_the_roads/traffic_management/left_turn_on_red_.html Left Turn On Red Scheme, Singapore] ONE Motoring, Land Transport Authority Singapore 2011-08-27</ref>

In [[Republic of China|Taiwan (Republic of China)]], right turn on red is always prohibited, except when there is a green arrow along with the red light.

==Pedestrian safety==
Turns on red are especially problematic for [[pedestrians]] due to drivers looking left for traffic on red light and not noticing a pedestrian waiting to cross the street to the driver's right. This may lead to a "right hook" collision when the driver and pedestrian both enter the intersection. Right on red reduces perceived safety for pedestrians and hence [[walkability]]. [[Suburbanization]] and car oriented development of the west has been a driving force behind right turn on red{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, although in some downtown core areas even in Western US right on red is explicitly prohibited with signs.

==Left turn on red==

In the U.S., 37 states and [[Puerto Rico]] allow left turns on red only if both the origin and destination streets are [[one-way traffic|one way]]. See South Carolina law <ref>[http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t56c005.htm scstatehouse.gov]</ref> Section 56-5-970 C3, for example. Six other states, namely [[Alaska]], [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Michigan]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], allow left turns on red onto a one-way street even from a two-way street.<ref>[http://touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/aac/title13/chapter002/section010.htm touchngo.com]</ref><ref>[http://law.onecle.com/florida/motor-vehicles/316.075.html]</ref><ref>[http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title49/T49CH8SECT49-802.htm legislature.idaho.gov]</ref><ref>[http://legislature.mi.gov/doc.aspx?mcl-257-612 legislature.mi.gov]</ref><ref>[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.055 apps.leg.wa.gov]</ref> In Washington, freeway on-ramps are considered one-way streets for the purposes of the left turn on red law.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20081019043920/http://dwb.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/6288133p-5484559c.html dwb.thenewstribune.com]</ref> The following states and territories ban left turns on red: [[South Dakota]] (unless permitted by local ordinance), [[Connecticut]], [[Maine]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[North Carolina]], the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Guam]]. [[New York City]] also prohibits left turn on red lights, unless a sign indicates otherwise.

In Canada, left turn on red light from a one-way road into a one-way road is permitted except in some areas of [[Quebec]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Prince Edward Island]]. Left turn on red light from a two-way road into a one-way road is permitted in [[British Columbia]]<ref name="BC Motor Vehicle Act, Sec 129">[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/96318_05#section129 BC Motor Vehicle Act], Section 129</ref> and [[Ontario]],<ref>[http://guelph.canadianlisted.com/books/the-official-drivers-handbook_471852.html]</ref> but only if the driver turns onto the closest lane and yields to pedestrians and cross traffic.

In [[New Zealand]], left turns on red are permitted at some intersections with a "free turn" sign, or a special lane passing to the left of the traffic light, which sits on a [[traffic island]].
