'''''Annales Cambriae''''', or ''The Annals of [[Wales]]'', is the name given to a complex of Cambro-Latin [[chronicle]]s deriving ultimately from a text compiled from diverse sources at [[St David's]] in [[Dyfed]], Wales, not later than the 10th century. Despite the name, the ''Annales Cambriae'' record not only events in Wales, but also events in [[Ireland]], [[Cornwall]], [[England]], [[Scotland]] and sometimes further afield, though the focus of the events recorded especially in the later two thirds of the text is Wales.

==Sources==
The principal versions of ''Annales Cambriae'' appear in four manuscripts:

'''A''': London, British Library, MS. Harley 3859, folios 190r-193r.<br>
'''B''': London (Kew), [[Public Record Office]], MS. E.164/1 (K.R. Misc. Books, Series I) pp. 2-26<br>
'''C''': London, British Library, MS. Cotton Domitian A.i, folios 138r-155r<br>
'''D''': [[Exeter Cathedral|Exeter, Cathedral]] Library, MS. 3514, pp. 523-28, the ''Cronica ante aduentum Domini''.<br>
'''E''': ''ibid.'', pp. 507-19, the ''Cronica de Wallia''.

*'''A''' is in a hand of about 1100x1130 AD{{clarify}} inserted without title into an MS. of the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' where it is immediately followed by a pedigree for [[Owain ap Hywel]] (d. 988). Although no explicit chronology is given in the MS., its annals seem to run from about AD 445 to 977 with the last entry at 954, making it likely that the text belongs to the second half of the tenth century.
*'''B''' was written, probably at the [[Cistercian]] abbey of [[Neath]], at the end of the 13th century. It is entitled ''Annales ab orbe condito adusque A. D. mcclxxxvi [1286].'' 
*'''C''' is part of a book written at St David's, and is entitled ''Annales ab orbe condito adusque A. D. mcclxxviii [1288]''; this is also of the late 13th century.

Two of the texts, '''B''' and '''C''',  have an opening section of general European history derived from [[Isidore of Seville]]'s ''Origines'' ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Isidore/5*.html#39 Book V, ch. 39]), through the medium of [[Bede]]'s [http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Chronica_minora Chronica minora]. After A.D. 457, '''B''' agrees nearly with '''A''' until '''A''' ends, and after the empire of [[Heraclius]] (610-41) '''C''' mostly agrees with '''A''' until '''A''' ends, although it is clear that '''A''' was not the common source for '''B''' and '''C''' (Dumville 2002, p. xi). '''B''' and '''C''' diverge after 1203, '''C''' having fewer and briefer Welsh entries.

'''D''' and '''E''' are found in a manuscript written at the Cistercian abbey of [[Whitland]] in south-west Wales in the later 13th century; the ''Cronica ante aduentum Domini'' extends from 1132 BC to 1285 AD, while the ''Cronica de Wallia'' extends from 1190 to 1266.

'''A''' alone has benefited from a complete diplomatic edition (Phillimore 1888).<ref>Phillimore, Egerton (ed.), 1888 "The Annales Cambriae and Old Welsh Genealogies from Harleian MS. 3859", ''Y Cymmrodor''; 9 (1888) pp. 141-183.

==Source for the Arthurian legend==
There are two entries in the Annals on [[King Arthur]], one on [[Mordred|Medraut]] (Mordred) and one on [[Merlin|Myrddin]] (Merlin). These entries have been presented in the past as proof of the existence of Arthur and Merlin, although that view is no longer widely held. Some say it is interesting to note that all the other people mentioned in the chronicle are real and this argument is often offered as evidence for the historicity of Arthur, Merlin and Mordred; however, given that the entries, or at least the insertion of the names of Arthur and Merlin, could have been added arbitrarily as late as 970, long after the development of the early Arthurian myth, it cannot be taken as a particularly conclusive argument.

Entries on Arthur, Medrod and Merlin (Myrddin):

:Year 72 (c. AD [[516]]) The [[Battle of Mons Badonicus|Battle of Badon]], in which Arthur carried the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ on his shoulders for three days and three nights and the Britons were victors.
:Year 93 (c. AD [[537]]) The [[Battle of Camlann|Strife of Camlann]] in which Arthur and Medraut fell [and there was death in Britain and in Ireland.] Text in brackets not in MSS. '''B''' or '''C'''.
:Year 129 (c. AD [[573]]) The [[Battle of Arfderydd]] (''Armterid'', '''A'''; ''Erderit'', '''B'''; ''Arderit'', '''C''') [between the sons of Elifer, and [[Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio|Guendoleu son of Keidau]]; in which battle Guendoleu fell; and Merlin (''Merlinus'') went mad.] Text in brackets found only in MS. '''B'''.
