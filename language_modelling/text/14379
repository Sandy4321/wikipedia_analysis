{{US Constitution article series}}
The '''Constitution of the United States of America''' is the [[supreme law]] of the [[United States]]. It is the foundation and source of the legal authority underlying the existence of the United States of America and the federal government of the United States. It provides the framework for the organization of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and for the relationship of the federal government to the states, to citizens, and to all people within the United States.

The Constitution defines the three main branches of government: a legislature, the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]; an executive branch led by the [[President of the United States|President]]; and a judicial branch headed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The Constitution specifies the powers and duties of each branch. The Constitution reserves all unenumerated powers for the respective [[U.S. state|states]] and the people, thereby establishing the [[Federalism|federal system]] of government.

The United States Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, by the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[ratification|ratified]] by conventions in each [[U.S. state]] in the name of "The People".  The Constitution has been [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amended]] twenty-seven times; the first ten amendments are known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].<ref name="Constitution of the United States of America">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America|title=WikiSource: Constitution of the United States of America|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[WikiSource]]}}</ref><ref name="Primary Documents in American History">{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Constitution.html|title=Primary Documents in American History: The United States Constitution|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the United States Constitution}}

===Drafting and ratification requirements===
The [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] was the first constitution of the United States of America.<ref>Christian G. Fritz, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZpKCvUacmSwC&pg=RA1-PA168&lpg=RA1-PA168&dq=christian+g+fritz+%22american+sovereigns%22&source=web&ots=UjY_WKHNjv&sig=Y2_7OZMg6ksk_866oiD44FArH-w&hl=en#PRA1-PA1,M1 ''American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 131 [ISBN 978-0-521-88188-3] (noting that "Madison, along with other Americans clearly understood" the Articles of Confederation "to be the first federal Constitution.")</ref>

In September 1786, commissioners from five states met in the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] to discuss adjustments to the [[Articles of Confederation]] that would improve commerce. They invited state representatives to convene in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to discuss improvements to the [[History of the United States (1776<U+2013>1789)#Development of federal institutions|federal government]]. After debate, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787.<ref name = "National Archives Delegates to the Constitutional Convention"/>  Twelve states, [[Rhode Island]] being the only exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in May 1787.<ref name="National Archives Delegates to the Constitutional Convention">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=National Archives Article on the Constitutional Convention|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]}}</ref>  The resolution calling the Convention specified that its purpose was to propose amendments to the Articles, but through discussion and debate it became clear by mid-June that, rather than amend the existing Articles, the Convention decided to propose a rewritten Constitution.<ref name = "National Archives Constitution of the United States"/>  The [[Philadelphia Convention]] voted to keep the debates secret, so that the delegates could speak freely. They also decided to draft a new fundamental government design. Despite Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation stating that the union created under the Articles was "perpetual" and that any alteration must be "agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State,"<ref name="Articles of Confederation">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation|title=Articles of Confederation|accessdate=2009-07-18|author=[[WikiSource]]}}</ref> Article VII of the proposed constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect (for the participating states).<ref name="Constitution of the United States of America" /> Current knowledge of the drafting and construction of the United States Constitution comes primarily from the diaries left by [[James Madison]], who kept a complete record of the proceedings at the Constitutional Convention.<ref name = "National Archives Article on James Madison"/>

===Work of the Philadelphia Convention===
The [[Virginia Plan]] was the unofficial agenda for the Convention, and was drafted chiefly by [[James Madison]], considered to be "The Father of the Constitution" for his major contributions.<ref name="National Archives Article on James Madison">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=National Archives Article on James Madison|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]}}</ref>  It was weighted toward the interests of the larger states, and proposed among other points:
*A powerful [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] with a [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and a [[United States Senate|Senate]]<ref name = "National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention"/>
*An [[executive (government)|executive]] chosen by the legislature
*A [[judiciary]], with life-terms of service and vague powers
*The national legislature would be able to [[veto]] state laws

The contentious issue of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was too controversial to be resolved during the convention. As a result, the original Constitution contained four provisions tacitly allowing slavery to continue for the next 20 years. Section 9 of Article I allowed the continued "importation" of such persons, Section 2 of Article IV prohibited the provision of assistance to escaping persons and required their return if successful and Section 2 of Article I defined other persons as "three-fifths" of a person for calculations of each state's official population for representation and federal taxation.<ref>Section 2 of Article I provides in part: "Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states . . . by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons."</ref> Article V prohibited any amendments or legislation changing the provision regarding slave importation until 1808, thereby giving the States then existing 20 years to resolve this issue. The failure to do so contributed to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>See ''South Carolina Declaration of Causes in Seccession'' (December 24, 1860), reprinted in Richard Hofstadter, ''Great Issues in American History''.

Contrary to the process for "alteration" set out in Article 13 of the ''Articles'', Congress submitted the proposal to the states and set the terms for representation.

On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was completed, followed by a speech given by [[Benjamin Franklin]], who urged unanimity,
although the Convention decided that only nine states were needed to ratify. The Convention submitted the Constitution to the [[Congress of the Confederation]], where it received approval according to [[Articles of Confederation|Article 13 of the Articles of Confederation]].<ref name="National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]}}</ref>

Once the Congress of the Confederation received word of New Hampshire's ratification, it set a timetable for the start of operations under the new Constitution, and on March 4, 1789, the [[Federal government of the United States|government]] began operations.

===Historical influences===
Several ideas in the Constitution were new, and a large number were drawn from the literature of [[Republicanism in the United States]], the experiences of the 13 states, and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] experience with [[mixed government]]. The most important influence from the European continent was from [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], who emphasized the need to have balanced forces pushing against each other to prevent tyranny. (This in itself reflects the influence of [[Polybius]]'s 2nd century BC treatise on the [[separation of powers|checks and balances]] of the constitution of the [[Roman Republic]].) British political philosopher [[John Locke]] was a major influence, and the [[due process]] clause of the Constitution was partly based on [[common law]] stretching back to [[Magna Carta]] (1215).<ref name="National Archives Article on the Entire Constitutional Convention"/>

===Influences on the Bill of Rights===
The [[United States Bill of Rights]] consists of the ten amendments added to the Constitution in 1791, as supporters of the constitution had promised critics during the debates of 1788.<ref name="National Archive Article on the Bill of Rights">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters.html|title=National Archives Article on the Bill of Rights|accessdate=2007-12-16|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration|NARA]]}}</ref>  The English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights (1689)]] was an inspiration for the American Bill of Rights. Both require [[jury trial]]s, contain a [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]], prohibit excessive [[bail]] and forbid [[cruel and unusual punishment|"cruel and unusual punishments."]] Many liberties protected by state constitutions and the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] were incorporated into the Bill of Rights.

==Articles of the Constitution==
{{wikisource|Constitution of the United States of America}}
The Constitution consists of a preamble, seven original articles, [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|twenty-seven amendments]], and a paragraph certifying its enactment by the constitutional convention.

===Preamble: Statement of purpose===
{{main|Preamble to the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Preamble}}
{{cquote|We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence<!--This is the original spelling of ensure and defense as written in the Constitution; DO NOT CHANGE  !!!!!!    -->, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.|||United States Constitution|Preamble}}

The Preamble does not grant any particular authority to the federal government and it does not prohibit any particular authority. It establishes the fact that the federal government has no authority outside of what follows the preamble, as amended. "We the people", is one of the most-quoted sections of the Constitution. It was thought by the [[Federalist]]s during this time that there was no need for a bill of rights as they thought that the preamble explained the people's rights.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Article One: Legislative power===
{{Politics of the United States}}
{{main|Article One of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article I}}
Article One describes the [[Congress]], the [[legislature|legislative branch]] of the federal government. The [[United States Congress]] is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of two co-equal houses: the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to represent the people, and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to represent the States.

The article establishes the manner of [[Elections in the United States|election]] and the qualifications of members of each body. Representatives must be at least 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for seven years, and live in the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen for nine years, and live in the state they represent.

Article I, Section 1, reads, "All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives." This provision gives Congress more than simply the responsibility to establish the rules governing its proceedings and for the punishment of its members; it places the power of the government primarily in Congress.

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Enumerated powers|Article I Section 8]] enumerates the legislative powers. The powers listed and all other powers are made the exclusive responsibility of the legislative branch:

<blockquote>The Congress shall have power... To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.</blockquote>

[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I Section IX]] provides a list of eight specific limits on congressional power and [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I Section X]] limits the rights of the states.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has interpreted the [[Commerce Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] in Article One to allow Congress to enact legislation that is neither expressly listed in the enumerated power nor expressly denied in the limitations on Congress. In ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the United States Supreme Court fell back on the strict construction of the necessary and proper clause to read that Congress had "[t]he foregoing powers and all other powers..."

===Article Two: Executive power===
{{main|Article Two of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article II}}

'''Section analysis'''

Section 1 creates the [[President of the United States|presidency]].  The section states that the executive power is vested in a President.  The presidential term is four years and the Vice President serves the identical term.  This section originally set the method of electing the President and Vice President, but this method has been superseded by the Twelfth Amendment.

*Qualifications.  The President must be a natural born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years old and a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.  An obsolete part of this clause provides that instead of being a natural born citizen, a person may be a citizen at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.  The reason for this clause was to extend eligibility to Citizens of the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, regardless of their place of birth, who were born under the allegiance of a foreign sovereign before the founding of the United States.  Without this clause, no one would have been eligible to be president until thirty-five years after the founding of the United States.

*Succession. Section 1 specifies that the Vice President [[United States presidential line of succession|succeeds to the presidency]] if the President is removed, unable to discharge the powers and duties of office, dies while in office, or resigns. The original text ("the same shall devolve") left it unclear whether this succession was intended to be on an [[Acting president|acting basis]] (merely taking on the powers of the office) or permanent (assuming the Presidency itself). After the death of [[William Henry Harrison]], [[John Tyler]] set the precedent that the succession was permanent; this practice was followed when later presidents died in office.  Today the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] states that the Vice President becomes President upon the death or disability of the President.

*Pay.  The President receives "Compensation" for being the president, and this compensation may not be increased or decreased during the president's term in office.  The president may not receive other compensation from either the United States or any of the individual states.

*Oath of office.  The final clause creates the presidential oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.

Section 2 grants substantive powers to the president:
*The president is the Commander in Chief of the armed forces, and of the state militias when these are called into federal service.
*The president may require opinions of the principal officers of the federal government.
*The president may grant reprieves and pardons, except in cases of impeachment (i.e., the president cannot pardon himself or herself to escape impeachment by Congress).

Section 2 grants and limits the president's appointment powers:
*The president may make treaties, with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senators who are present agree.
*With the advice and consent of the Senate, the President may appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States whose appointments are not otherwise described in the Constitution.
*Congress may give the power to appoint lower officers to the President alone, to the courts, or to the heads of departments.
*The president may make any of these appointments during a congressional recess.  Such a "recess appointment" expires at the end of the next session of Congress.

Section 3 opens by describing the president's relations with Congress:
*The president reports on the state of the union.
*The president may convene either house, or both houses, of Congress.
*When the two houses of Congress cannot agree on the time of adjournment, the president may adjourn them to some future date.

Section 3 adds:
*The president receives ambassadors.
*The president sees that the laws are faithfully executed.
*The president commissions all the offices of the federal government.

Section 4 provides for removal of the president and other federal officers.  The president is removed on [[impeachment]] for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

===Article Three: Judicial power===
{{main|Article Three of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article III}}
Article Three describes the [[United States Federal judiciary|court system]] (the [[judiciary|judicial branch]]), including the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The article requires that there be one court called the Supreme Court; Congress, at its discretion, can create lower courts, whose judgments and orders are reviewable by the Supreme Court. Article Three also creates the right to [[jury trial|trial by jury]] in all [[criminal law|criminal cases]], defines the crime of [[treason]], and charges Congress with providing for a punishment for it. This Article also sets the kinds of cases that may be heard by the federal judiciary, which cases the Supreme Court may hear first (called [[original jurisdiction]]), and that all other cases heard by the Supreme Court are by appeal under such regulations as the Congress shall make.

===Article Four: States' powers and limits===
{{main|Article Four of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article IV}}
Article Four describes the relationship between the states and the federal government and amongst the states. For instance, it requires states to give "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" to the public acts, records, and court proceedings of the other states. Congress is permitted to [[regulation|regulate]] the manner in which proof of such acts, records, or proceedings may be admitted. The [[Privileges and Immunities Clause|"privileges and immunities" clause]] prohibits state governments from discriminating against [[United States nationality law|citizens]] of other states in favor of resident citizens (e.g., having tougher penalties for residents of [[Ohio]] convicted of crimes within [[Michigan]]). It also establishes [[extradition]] between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for [[freedom of movement]] and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, especially by citizens who live near state borders; but in the days of the [[Articles of Confederation]], crossing state lines was often a much more arduous and costly process. Article Four also provides for the creation and admission of new states. The [[Territorial Clause]] gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States. Finally, the fourth section of Article Four requires the United States to guarantee to each state a [[republican form of government]], and to protect the states from invasion and violence.

===Article Five: Amendments===
{{main|Article Five of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article V}}
An amendment may be ratified in three ways:
* The new amendment may be approved by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, then sent to the states for approval.
* Two-thirds of the state legislatures may apply to Congress for a constitutional convention to consider amendments, which are then sent to the states for approval.
* Congress may require ratification by special [[Conventions within the states to ratify an amendment to the United States Constitution|convention]]. The convention method has been used only once, to approve the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] (repealing prohibition, 1933).

Regardless of the method of proposing an amendment, final ratification requires approval by three-fourths of the states.

Today Article Five places only one limit on the amending power: no amendment may deprive a state of equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent.  The original Article V included other limits on the amending power regarding slavery and taxation; however, these limits expired in 1808.

===Article Six: Federal power===
{{main|Article Six of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article VI}}
Article Six establishes the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States made according to it, to be the [[supremacy clause|supreme law]] of the land, and that "the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the laws or constitutions of any state notwithstanding." It also validates [[government debt|national debt]] created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all federal and state legislators, officers, and judges take oaths or affirmations to support the Constitution. This means that the states' constitutions and laws should not conflict with the laws of the federal constitution and that in case of a conflict, state judges are legally bound to honor the federal laws and constitution over those of any state.

Article Six also states "no [[religious test|religious Test]] shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."

===Article Seven: Ratification===
{{main|Article Seven of the United States Constitution}}
{{see also|wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Article VII}}
Article Seven sets forth the requirements for [[ratification]] of the Constitution. The Constitution would not take effect until at least nine states had ratified the Constitution in state conventions specially convened for that purpose, and it would only apply to those states that ratified it.<ref name="National Archives Constitution of the United States">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html|title=National Archives Article on the Constitution|accessdate=2008-09-01|author=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]}}</ref> (''See above [[#History|Drafting and ratification requirements]].'')

==Judicial review==
{{see also|Judicial review in the United States}}

The way the Constitution is understood is influenced by court decisions, especially those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. These decisions are referred to as [[precedent]]s. In the 1803 case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', the Supreme Court established the doctrine of [[judicial review]].  Judicial review is the power of the Court to examine federal legislation, executive agency rules and state laws, to decide their [[constitutionality]], and to strike them down if found unconstitutional. Judicial review includes the power of the Court to explain the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to particular cases. Over the years, Court decisions on issues ranging from governmental regulation of [[radio]] and [[television]] to the rights of the accused in criminal cases have changed the way many constitutional clauses are interpreted, without amendment to the actual text of the Constitution.

Legislation passed to implement the Constitution, or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many federal executive agencies have a similar effect. If an action of Congress or the agencies is challenged, however, it is the court system that ultimately decides whether these actions are permissible under the Constitution.

==Amendments==
The framers of the Constitution were aware that changes would be necessary if the Constitution was to endure as the nation grew. However, they were also conscious that such change should not be easy, lest it permit ill-conceived and hastily passed [[Constitutional amendment|amendments]]. On the other hand, they also wanted to ensure that a rigid requirement of unanimity would not block action desired by the vast majority of the population. Their solution was a two-step process for proposing and ratifying new amendments.<ref>{{cite book|title=Toward a theory of constitutional amendment |journal=The American Political Science Review |last=Lutz |first=Donald |year=1994}}</ref>

Amending the Constitution is a two-part process: amendments must be proposed then ratified. Amendments can be proposed one of two ways. To date, all amendments, whether ratified or not, have been proposed by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress. Over 10,000 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; during the last several decades, between 100 and 200 have been offered in a typical congressional year. Most of these ideas never leave Congressional committee, and far fewer get proposed by the Congress for ratification.

Alternatively, if two-thirds of the state legislatures demand one, Congress must call for a constitutional convention, which would have the power to propose amendments. As no such convention has been called, it is unclear how one would work in practice. In two instances<U+2014>reapportionment in the 1960s and a balanced federal budget during the 1970s and 1980s<U+2014>attempts to use this process have come extremely close to triggering a constitutional convention. The apportionment debate of the 1960s fell only one state short of the required number of states

Regardless of how the amendment is proposed, it must also be ratified by three-fourths of states. Congress determines whether the state legislatures or [[state ratifying conventions|special state conventions]] ratify the amendment. The [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] is the only one that employed state conventions for ratification.

There are currently only a few proposals for amendments which have entered mainstream political debate. These include the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], the [[Balanced Budget Amendment]], and the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]]. All three proposals are supported primarily by conservatives, but failed during periods of Republican control of Congress to achieve the supermajorities necessary for submission to the states. As such, none of these is likely to be proposed under the [[111th United States Congress|current Congress]], which is controlled by the more liberal Democratic Party.

Unlike [[Constitutional amendment#Form of changes to the text|amendments to most constitutions]], amendments to the United States Constitution are appended to the body of the text without altering or removing what already exists, although nothing prevents a future amendment from doing so.

===Successful amendments===
{{main|List of amendments to the United States Constitution}}
The Constitution has twenty-seven amendments. The first ten, collectively known as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], were ratified simultaneously by 1791. The following seventeen were ratified separately over the next two centuries.

====The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1 to 10)====

{{wikisource|United States Bill of Rights}}

It is commonly understood that originally the Bill of Rights was not intended to apply to the states; however, there is no such limit in the text itself, except where an amendment refers specifically to the federal government.  One example is the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which says only that "Congress shall make no law...", and under which some states in the early years of the nation officially [[state religion|established a religion]]. A rule of inapplicability to the states remained until 1868, when the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was passed, which stated, in part, that:

{{cquote|No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}}

The Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to extend most, but not all, parts of the Bill of Rights to the states. Nevertheless, the balance of state and federal power has remained a battle in the Supreme Court.

The amendments that became the Bill of Rights were the last ten of the twelve amendments proposed in 1789. The second of the twelve proposed amendments, regarding the compensation of members of Congress, remained unratified until 1992, when the legislatures of enough states finally approved it; as a result, after pending for two centuries, it became the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]].

The [[Congressional Apportionment Amendment|first of the twelve]], which is still technically pending before the state legislatures for ratification, pertains to the apportionment of the [[United States House of Representatives]] after each decennial [[United States Census|census]]. The most recent state whose lawmakers are known to have ratified this proposal is [[Kentucky]] in 1792, during that commonwealth's first month of statehood.

*[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]: addresses the rights of [[Freedom of religion in the United States|freedom of religion]] (prohibiting Congress from [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishing a religion]] and protecting the right to [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|free exercise of religion]]), [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], and [[freedom of petition]].
*[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]]: guarantees the right of individuals to possess firearms.  The most recent decision interpreting the Second Amendment is [[District of Columbia v. Heller]].
*[[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]]: prohibits the government from using private homes as quarters for soldiers during peacetime without the consent of the owners. The only existing case law regarding this amendment is a lower court decision in the case of ''[[Engblom v. Carey]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment03/ |title=Findlaw.com |publisher=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>
*[[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]: guards against [[search and seizure|searches, arrests, and seizures]] of [[property]] without a specific warrant or a "[[probable cause]]" to believe a crime has been committed. Some rights to privacy have been inferred from this amendment and others by the Supreme Court.
*[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]: forbids [[trial (law)|trial]] for a major [[crime]] except after [[indictment]] by a [[grand jury]]; prohibits [[double jeopardy]] (repeated trials), except in certain very limited circumstances; forbids punishment without [[due process]] of law; and provides that an accused person may not be compelled to [[self-incrimination|testify against himself]] (this is also known as "[[Taking the Fifth]]" or "Pleading the Fifth"). This is regarded as the "rights of the accused" amendment, otherwise known as the [[Miranda rights]] after the Supreme Court case. It also prohibits government from taking private property for public use without "[[just compensation]]," the basis of [[eminent domain]] in the United States.
*[[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]: guarantees a speedy public trial for criminal offenses. It requires trial by a [[jury]], guarantees the right to [[legal counsel]] for the accused, and guarantees that the accused may require [[witness]]es to attend the trial and testify in the presence of the accused. It also guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against him. The Sixth Amendment has several court cases associated with it, including ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', ''[[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]]'', ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', and ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]''. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that the fifth amendment prohibition on forced self-incrimination and the sixth amendment clause on right to counsel were to be made known to all persons placed under arrest, and these clauses have become known as the [[Miranda warning|Miranda rights]].
*[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]: assures trial by jury in [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]].
*[[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]: forbids excessive [[bail]] or [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s, and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].
*[[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]]: declares that the listing of individual rights in the Constitution and Bill of Rights is not meant to be comprehensive; and that the other rights not specifically mentioned are retained by the people.
*[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]: reserves to the states respectively, or to the people, any powers the Constitution did not delegate to the United States, nor prohibit the states from exercising.

====Subsequent amendments (11 to 27)====
{{wikisource|Additional amendments to the United States Constitution}}

Amendments to the Constitution after the Bill of Rights cover many subjects. The majority of the seventeen later amendments stem from continued efforts to expand individual civil or political liberties, while a few are concerned with modifying the basic governmental structure drafted in Philadelphia in 1787. Although the United States Constitution has been amended 27 times, only 26 of the amendments are currently in effect because the twenty-first amendment supersedes the eighteenth.

===Unratified amendments===
{{see also|Proposals for Amendments to the United States Constitution|Unsuccessful attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution}}

Of the thirty-three amendments that have been proposed by Congress, six have failed ratification by the required three-quarters of the state legislatures, and four of those six are still technically pending before state lawmakers (see ''[[Coleman v. Miller]]''). Starting with the 18th Amendment, each proposed amendment has included a deadline for passage, except the 19th Amendment (women's voting) and the [[Child Labor Amendment]], proposed in 1924 and still unratified. The following are the unratified proposals:
* The [[Article the First|Congressional Apportionment Amendment]], proposed by the [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] on September 25, 1789, defined a formula for how many members there would be in the [[United States House of Representatives]] after each decennial census. Ratified by eleven states, the last being [[Kentucky]] in June 1792 during Kentucky's initial month of statehood, this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. In principle it may yet be ratified, though as written it became moot when the population of the United States reached ten million.
* The so-called missing thirteenth amendment, or "[[Titles of Nobility Amendment]]" (TONA), proposed by the [[11th United States Congress|11th Congress]] on May 1, 1810, would have ended the citizenship of any American accepting "any Title of [[Nobility]] or Honour" from any foreign power. Some maintain that the amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states, and that a conspiracy has suppressed it, but this has been thoroughly debunked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thirdamendment.com/missing.html |title=The Missing Thirteenth Amendment |publisher=Thirdamendment.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>  Known to have been ratified by lawmakers in twelve states, the last in 1812, this amendment contains no expiration date for ratification. It may yet be ratified.
* The [[Corwin Amendment]], proposed by the [[36th United States Congress|36th Congress]] on March 2, 1861, would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the federal government to "abolish or interfere" with the "domestic institutions" of the states (a delicate way of referring to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]). It was ratified by only [[Ohio]] and [[Maryland]] lawmakers before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. [[Illinois]] lawmakers<U+2014>sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time<U+2014>likewise approved it, but that action is of questionable validity. The proposed amendment contains no expiration date for ratification and may yet be ratified. However, adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War likely means that the amendment would be ineffective if adopted.
* A [[child labor amendment]] proposed by the [[68th United States Congress|68th Congress]] on June 2, 1924.  It provides, "The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age." This amendment is highly unlikely to be ratified, since subsequent federal [[Child labor laws in the United States|child labor laws]] have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress's powers under the [[Commerce Clause]].

Expired deadlines.  This category is separate from the other four unratified constitutional amendments.  These two were not ratified by their deadlines and they have expired.
* The [[Equal Rights Amendment]], or ERA, which reads in pertinent part "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex." Proposed by the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]] on March 22, 1972, it was ratified by the legislatures of 35 states, and expired on either March 22, 1979 or on June 30, 1982, depending upon one's point of view of a controversial three-year extension of the ratification deadline, which was passed by the [[95th United States Congress|95th Congress]] in 1978. Of the 35 states ratifying it, four later rescinded their ratifications before the extended ratification period which began on March 23, 1979 and a fifth, while not going so far as to rescind its earlier ratification, adopted a resolution stipulating that its approval would not extend beyond March 22, 1979. There continues to be disagreement over whether such reversals are valid; no court has ruled on the question, including the Supreme Court. A precedent against the validity of rescission was first established during the ratification process of the 14th Amendment when Ohio and [[New Jersey]] rescinded their earlier approvals, but yet were counted as ratifying states when the 14th Amendment was ultimately proclaimed part of the Constitution in 1868.
*The [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]] was proposed by the 95th Congress on August 22, 1978. Had this amendment been ratified, it would have granted to [[Washington, D.C.]] two Senators and at least one member of the House of Representatives as though the District of Columbia were a state. Ratified by the legislatures of only 16 states (out of the required 38), the proposed amendment expired on August 22, 1985.

==Criticism of the Constitution==
Several academics have criticized the Constitution for specific shortcomings. University of Virginia professor [[Larry Sabato]] wants an amendment to organize primaries to prevent a "frontloaded calendar" long before the election to prevent a "race by states to the front of the primary pack" which subverts the national interest, in his view.<ref name=twsSEPnn876/> Sabato details more objections in his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]''.<ref name=twsSEPnn876>{{cite news

[[University of Texas]] law professor [[Sanford Levinson]] also wonders whether it makes sense to give "[[Wyoming]] the same number of votes as [[California]], which has roughly seventy times the population".<ref name=twsSEPnn81/> He thinks this imbalance causes a "steady redistribution of resources from large states to small states."<ref name=twsSEPnn81/> Levinson is critical of the [[electoral college]] since it allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority of votes.<ref name=twsSEPnn81>{{cite news
