'''Omayra S<U+00E1>nchez''' (sometimes spelled '''Omaira Sanchez''') was a 13-year-old victim of the [[Armero tragedy|1985 eruption]] of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[volcano]], which erupted on November 13, 1985, in [[Armero]], [[Colombia]]  causing massive [[lahars]] which killed nearly 25,000. Trapped for three days in water, concrete, and other debris before she died, Omayra captured the attention of the media as volunteer workers told of a girl they were unable to save. Videos of her communicating with workers, smiling and making gestures to video cameras circulated around the media. Her "courage and dignity" touched Frank Fournier and many other relief workers who gathered around her to pray and be with her. 

After 60 hours of struggling, she died. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond promptly to the threat of the volcano and also the struggle for volunteer rescue workers to save trapped victims who would otherwise be quickly saved and treated.

S<U+00E1>nchez became famous for a photograph of her taken by photojournalist [[Frank Fournier]] shortly before she died. When published worldwide after the young girl's death, the image caused controversy because of the photographer's decision to take it and the Colombian government's inaction in not working to prevent the Armero tragedy despite the forewarning that had been available.<ref name=picp>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4231020.stm |title=Picture power: Tragedy of Omayra Sanchez |date=30 September 2005 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref>

== Background ==
On November 13, 1985, the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano erupted. [[Pyroclastic flow]]s shot from the crater to the mountain's icecap, where they melted the ice to form [[lahar]]s, or volcanic mudflows. These lahars cascaded down the mountain into the river valleys below. One lahar was responsible for most of the damage, and proceeded in three waves. Traveling at a rapid speed of {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} per second, the first pulse enveloped most of Armero and killed many (up to 20,000) of its inhabitants. Two more pulses weakened buildings and another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby [[Chinchina]].<ref>Mart<U+00ED> and Ernst, p. 291.</ref> In total, the mudflows killed some 23,000 people and destroyed 14 villages and cities.<ref name=MWJ>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hGMaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9CoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6895,8660320&|title=Rescuers in Colombia refuse to give up hunt for survivors|date=November 18, 1985|accessdate=November 24, 2010|work=[[Milwaukee Journal]]}}</ref>

Omayra got trapped under her own home's concrete and debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped, held tight by the arms of her dead aunt.<ref name=DG>{{cite news|title=Trapped Girl, 13, Dies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 17, 1985|accessdate=December 31, 2010}}</ref>

== Death ==
Omayra was trapped up to her neck in water and the debris of her home for nearly 60 hours before she died, either of exposure,<ref name=picp/> [[gangrene]], or hypothermia.<ref name=JSOURCE/>. Omayra suffered through nearly 3 nights of agony before she died in a state of confusion.<ref name=picp/> During this time, she sang to Germ<U+00E1>n Santamar<U+00ED>a<ref name=SA/> and agreed to be interviewed. The teenage girl was scared, and often prayed or cried.<ref name=JSOURCE>{{cite news|url=http://www.j-source.ca/english_new/detail.php?id=5527|publisher=[[Canadian Journalism Foundation]]|work=Canadian Journalism Project|author=Lacey, Dana|title=Why We Don't Cover Pakistan|date=August 31, 2010|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref> On the third night, Omayra began [[hallucination|hallucinating]], saying that she did not want to be late for school.<ref name=picp/> At some point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest.

After 60 hours of exposure, Omayra died. Two hours before her death a broken pump arrived, and just four hours after, a regional town received 18 pumps.<ref name=MWJ/> Both her brother, Alvaro Enrique, and mother, Maria Aleida, survived the lahars, but her father also died. Omayra's mother commented, "I will live for my son, who only lost a finger."<ref name=DG/> She expressed her feelings about Omayra's death. "It is horrible, but we have to think about the living."<ref name=lp>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TX5WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QEENAAAAIBAJ&pg=3684,440325|title=Ordeal Ends in Death|work=[[Leader-Post]]|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=November 18, 1985|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>

As the public became aware of Omayra's situation through the media, her eventual death came to symbolize the tragic nature of the [[Armero tragedy|Armero disaster]] and highlight the failure of officials to properly account for victims who could have been saved. Controversy broke out when officials indicated that they had used the best of their supplies, and descriptions of the shortages were released. Volunteer relief workers said that even basic supplies ran out, such as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers, agreeing that there were not enough resources. Elaborating, they added that the rescue process was impeded by large crowds and senseless attention to organization. One police officer (unnamed) opined that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized.<ref name=S-N>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3RMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5678,7662718&|title=Colombian officials defend rescue effort; lack of equipment blamed|work=[[Star-News]]|date=November 24, 1985|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, admitted that he "understood criticism of the rescue effort",<ref name=S-N/> but directed it towards the fact that Colombia was "an undeveloped country" that didn't "have that kind of equipment."<ref name=S-N/>

== Photograph == 
A photograph, named "The Agony of Omayra S<U+00E1>nchez",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mq8yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=me8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3433,3016148|title=Ottawa Man Third|date=February 7, 1986|accessdate=April 19, 2011|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|publiser=Orban, James}}</ref> was taken by [[Frank Fournier]], who landed in [[Bogota]] on November 15. He traveled to Armero, which was, according to Fournier, "very remote", by driving for five hours and traveling on foot for another two and a half hours.<ref name=picp/> Reaching Armero at dawn on the 16th, he was directed to Omayra S<U+00E1>nchez by a farmer, who was at that time almost deserted, having been trapped for nearly three days. Fournier later described the town as "very haunting", with "eerie silence" marked by screaming. He took the photograph feeling that he could only "report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl" in his attempt to spread awareness of the disaster's need for relief efforts.<ref name=picp/>

At the time the now famous photograph was taken, the world was already fixated on the tragedy. Omayra was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the disaster. Almost immediately after its release, the image captured widespread attention. According to an unnamed BBC author, "many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life".<ref name=picp/> 

The image also attracted controversy after it appeared in ''[[Paris Match]]''. The public began to accuse Fournier of being "a vulture", to which he responded by stating, "I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it." He added, "I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders." <ref name=picp/> The picture later went on to win the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PEYsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2s4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6813,1694667|title=World Photo Award|date=February 7, 1986|accessdate=April 19, 2011|work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:El ruiz volcano.jpg|thumb|right|Nevado del Ruiz in 2006. The volcano remains active.]]
The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla group's raid and subsequent [[Palace of Justice siege]] on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Omayra's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html|title=Nevado del Ruiz (1985)|last=Camp, Vic|publisher=[[San Diego State University]]|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}</ref>

The [[volcano]] [[Nevado del Ruiz]] is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. It remains a significant threat to as many as 500,000 people in the Chinchina, Coello-Toche, Combeima, and Guali river valleys.<ref name=Thouret>{{cite conference |last=Thouret |first=Jean-Claude |coauthors=Murcia, A; Salinas, R; ''et al.'' |title=Stratigraphy and quaternary eruptive history of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif, Colombia.

[[Isabel Allende]]'s ''[[And of Clay Are We Created]]'' is based on these events. It is told from the perspective of a man who was present as Omayra died. Allende later wrote of her inspiration for the story, "Her [Omayra's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost."<ref>Correas de Zapata and Sayers Peden, p. 76.</ref>
