'''Mehamn Airport''' ({{lang-no|Meham lufthavn}}; {{Airport codes|MEH|ENMH|p=n}}) is a [[regional airport]] serving [[Mehamn]] in [[Gamvik]], [[Norway]]. The airport is located {{convert|2|km|sp=us}} from Mehman and is owned and operated by the state-owned [[Avinor]]. The asphalt [[runway]] is {{convert|880|m|sp=us}}. Services are operated by [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] using [[Bombardier Dash 8|Dash 8-100]] aircraft which connect to other communities in [[Finnmark]]. The routes are subsidized by the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]] through [[public service obligation]]s.

Both the village of [[Gamvik (village)|Gamvik]] and [[Kj<U+00F8>llefjord]] were considered as alternative locations for the airport, and both received smaller airfields before Mehamn Airport opened in 1974. Wider<U+00F8>e operated [[de Havilland Canada Twin Otter]]s until they were replaced with the Dash 8 in 1995. The airport served 16,810 passengers in 2012 and is the northern-most airport in [[Continental Europe]].

==History==
Plans for an airport on Nordskinnhalv<U+00F8>ya were first articulated by a committee appointed by [[Finnmark County Municipality]]. Their 1966 report recommended that six regional airports be built in Finnmark, which included Mehamn and [[Kj<U+00F8>llefjord]] as a possible site. Simultaneously the national government starting on planning a a national network of regional airports.<ref name=m64>Melling: 64</ref> The Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) looked into suitable sites at Mehamn, Kj<U+00F8>llefjord and Gamvik.<ref>Melling: 76</ref> The government prioritized construction in Finnmark last, so the regional airline Norving took initiative to build smaller airfields in selected communities.<ref name=m64 /> They took contact with both Lebesby and Gamvik Municipality to initiate construction.<ref>Melling: 65</ref>

Initially the CAA supported Gamvik as a location for a regional airport, in part because of the lower investment costs. The municipal council in Gamvik instead chose the municipal center of Mehamn, {{convert|20|km|sp=us}} from Gamvik. The Gamvik chapter of the [[Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps]] started fund-raising for Gamvik to build its own airport. It applied to the municipality, but no public funds were granted. [[Gamvik Airport]] opened on 29 August.<ref>Melling: 77</ref> Also at Kj<U+00F8>llefjord, {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} from Mehamn, locals decided to build their own airport. [[Kj<U+00F8>llefjord Airport]] opened in 1974, but because of the opening of Mehamn Airport it never saw any regular traffic.<ref name=m108>Melling: 108</ref>he use of the airports at Kj<U+00F8>llefjord and Gamvik fell out regular use from 1974 and were soon abandoned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kystmuseene.no/tettstedet-gamvik.4520093-109804.html |title=Tettstedet Gamvik |publisher=Gamvik Museum |last=Fredriksen |first=Rune A. |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=28 January 2013 |archivedate=28 January 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6E0O58Wc0 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=m108 />

Simultaneously as Mehamn was awarded an airport, [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] voted to build a new road which would better winter transport between the villages of Kj<U+00F8>llefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik, allow Mehamn Airport to efficiently serve the entire peninsula.<ref name=gynnild>{{cite web |url=http://avinor.moses.no/index.php?seks_id=135&element=kapittel&k=2 |title=Flyplassenes og flytrafikkens historie |work=Kulturminner p<U+00E5> norske lufthavner <U+2013> Landsverneplan for Avinor |publisher=[[Avinor]] |last=Gynnild |first=Olav |year=2009  |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archivedate=25 January 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DwQ1MXLE |deadurl=no}}</ref> Construction was subcontracted to [[Veidekke]].

The government opted to selected Wider<U+00F8>e and their Twin Otters, citing the need for a single operator for all subsidized regional routes in the country.<ref>Melling: 109</ref>

==Accidents and incidents==
On 11 March 1982 [[Wider<U+00F8>e Flight 933]] crashed into the [[Barents Sea]] between [[Berlev<U+00E5>g Airport]] and Mehamn Airport, killing all fifteen people on board the Twin Otter. The accident was caused by [[structural failure]] in the [[rudder]] and [[vertical stabilizer]] following severe [[clear-air turbulence]]. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harrier]] fighter, which resulted in four investigations<U+2014>none which found any evidence of a collision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stortinget.no/Global/pdf/Dokumentserien/2004-2005/dok24-200405.pdf |title=Rapport til Stortingets presidentskap fra Stortingets granskningskommisjon for Mehamn-ulykken |format=PDF |author=[[Parliament of Norway]] |date=20 September 2005 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=20 October 2012 |archivedate=20 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6BYbCvKKk |deadurl=no}}</ref>
