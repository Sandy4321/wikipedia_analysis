'''Chalcophyllite''' is a rare secondary [[copper]] [[arsenate]] mineral occurring in the oxidized zones of some [[arsenic]]-bearing copper deposits. It was first described from material collected in Germany.  At one time chalcophyllite from Wheal Tamar in Cornwall, England, was called tamarite, but this name is now discredited<ref name=RM/> (not to be confused with the [[amphibole]] mineral [[taramite]], which is quite different). At [[Wheal Gorland]] a specimen exhibiting partial replacement of [[liriconite]], Cu<sub>2</sub>Al(AsO<sub>4</sub>)(OH)<sub>4</sub>.4(H<sub>2</sub>O), by chalcophyllite has been found.<ref name=RM/>  The mineral is named from the Greek, ''chalco'' "copper" and ''fyllon'', "leaf", in allusion to its composition and platy structure.  It is a classic [[Mining in Cornwall|Cornish]] mineral that can be confused with tabular [[spangolite]].

==Formula==
Two different formulae are quoted in the literature for chalcophyllite,  Cu<sub>18</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>24</sub><U+00B7>36(H<sub>2</sub>O)<ref name=RRUFF/><ref name=RM/><ref name=HOM/> (molar mass 3098 g) and
Cu<sub>18</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>27</sub><U+00B7>33(H<sub>2</sub>O)<ref name=Mindat/><ref name=Webmin/><ref name=Dana/> (molar mass 2956 g).  The difference reflects the fact that the water content varies at room temperature based on relative humidity.<ref name=Mindat/>

==Unit cell==
Chalcophyllite crystallizes in the [[trigonal]] [[Crystal system|crystal class]], 3 2/m with [[space group]] R 3m<ref name=Webmin/> or {{overline|3}} with space group R {{overline|3}}.<ref name=RM/><ref name=HOM/><ref name=Mindat/><ref name=Dana/> Some authors choose a unit cell with three [[formula unit]]s per cell (Z=3), and some a smaller unit cell with only 1.5 formula units per cell (Z=1.5).  For the larger unit cell a = 10.77 <U+00C5>, c = 57.5 <U+00C5>, Z=3.<ref name=Webmin/><ref name=Dana/><ref name=AM58>Corbett (1973) American Mineralogist 58: 792<U+2013>793</ref>  For the smaller unit cell c is only half as long, a = 10.756 <U+00C5>, c = 28.678 <U+00C5>, Z = 1.5.<ref name=HOM/><ref name=Mindat/>

==Crystal habit==
Crystals are platy, six-sided and flattened perpendicular to the c [[Crystal structure|crystal axis]], and may be striated triangularly on these flattened faces.  It may form rosettes, or be drusy, foliated or massive.<ref name=Mindat/>

==Physical properties==

Cleavage is perfect perpendicular to the c crystal axis, and [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] occurs with {1010} as the twin plane. Fracture is irregular.  The mineral is soft, with [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] only 2, the same as [[gypsum]].  [[Specific gravity]] is generally given in the range 2.67 to 2.69, but Webmineral has 2.4 to 2.66. Chalcophyllite is soluble in acids and in ammonia.  It is not [[fluorescent]], nor [[radioactive]]. The water content varies at room temperature based on [[relative humidity]].  Chalcophyllite alters to [[chrysocolla]],<ref name=Mindat/> which is a copper-aluminium silicate with the formula (Cu,Al)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub><U+00B7>n(H<sub>2</sub>O).

==Optical properties==
Many copper minerals are blue or green in color; chalcophyllite is blue-green to emerald-green, with a pale green [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]] and vitreous to subadamantine luster, pearly on {0001}.  Crystals are transparent to translucent.  It is [[uniaxial]] (-) with [[refractive indices]] n<sub><U+03C9></sub> = 1.618 to 1.632 and n<sub><U+03B5></sub> = 1.552 to 1.575.  Indices of refraction vary markedly depending on the relative humidity since the water content varies at ambient temperature.<ref name=Mindat/>  It is [[pleochroic]] with O blue-green and E almost colorless.

==Environment==
Chalcophyllite is an uncommon secondary mineral occurring in the oxidized zones of some [[arsenic]]-bearing [[hydrothermal]] copper deposits. Associated minerals include [[azurite]], [[malachite]], [[brochantite]], [[chrysocolla]], [[spangolite]], [[connellite]], [[cuprite]], [[cyanotrichite]], [[strashimirite]], [[parnauite]], [[lavendulan]], [[cornubite]], [[langite]], [[clinoclase]], [[pharmacosiderite]] and [[mansfieldite]].<ref name=HOM/>  The type material is conserved at the [[Technische Universit<U+00E4>t Bergakademie Freiberg|Mining Academy]], Freiberg, Germany.<ref name=HOM/>  Notable occurrences include the Majuba Hill Mine, [[Antelope Range (Pershing County)|Antelope District]], Nevada, USA<ref name=RM/> and Cornwall, including [[Wheal Gorland]], UK.
