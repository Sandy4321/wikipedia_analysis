==History==
Russian-Iraqi relations have been generally part and parcel of their relations with the [[Third World]] countries and their national liberation movements, particularly [[Arab nationalism]], which for both historical and geostrategic reasons has been especially important for [[Moscow]]. However, at the same time, particularly between [[1958]] and [[1990]], [[Soviet]]-Iraqi relations were marked by some special features,<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_4_23/ai_80966042/pg_1 |title=Russian-Iraqi Relations: A Historical and Political analysis |accessdate=2008-03-04 |publisher=findarticles.com}}</ref> putting them in contrast with Soviet links with other [[Afro-Asian]] nations and even some states of the Arab [[Middle East]].
* Iraq was first of all the nearest of all Arab countries to the Soviet borders and because of that proximity the threat of Soviet expansion could have been seen as being much more real by its leaders than by the leaders of the other [[Arab states]].
* Different from the other Arab states of the [[Mashreq]], Iraq, since its very beginning in the [[1920]]s, contained a very substantial (close to 25 per cent) ethnic non-Arab Kurdish minority with specific constitutional rights, which were granted in [[1925]] as a condition for the incorporation of the largely Kurdish populated [[Mosul]] region into its borders.<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> The [[Kurdish people]], other groups of which live in [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and Russia, have never completely submitted to their division and lack of national self-determination, and in Iraq since [[1961]] have constantly demanded territorial autonomy. Their aspirations towards which the [[Soviet Union]] could not remain indifferent, were, however, putting it in the awkward situation of having to make a choice between their recognition and its general support of Arab nationalism and the friendly [[Iraqi government]].
* The [[Iraqi Communist Party]], which was formally founded in [[1934]], was one of the most effective and socially influential [[Marxist]] [[organization]]s in the region.<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> Although it was never strong enough to take power by itself, it nevertheless represented a by no means negligible political force in the country, being for Moscow after [[1958]], both a valuable asset and an embarrassment in its deals with the "progressive" but still often viciously anti-communist Iraqi government.
* Finally, Iraq's economic potential and relative wealth, especially after the [[1973 October War]] and the subsequent rise of the oil prices, made this country a financially attractive partner and customer for Moscow.<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> These economic aspects, which had never been absent in the past, have acquired additional importance since the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of Russia as a separate and [[Capitalism|pro-capitalist nation]].

Post-Soviet Russia, rejecting [[Marxist ideology]] and the ideological support of the [[Communist]] parties and the national liberation movements of the Third World peoples, is nevertheless still interested in cooperation with Iraq, and since [[1994]] has been supporting [[Baghdad]] politically against the [[United States]] imposed punitive sanctions.<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/>

</ref> The regime of [[List of Kings of Iraq|King]] [[Faisal II of Iraq|Faisal II]] was [[anti-communist]], and established links with [[Moscow]] due its dependence on the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Anglo<U+2013>Soviet Treaty of 1942]]. In [[January]] [[1955]], the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] criticised the [[Government of Iraq|Iraqi government]] decision to joined the [[Baghdad Pact]], which led to Iraq cutting diplomatic relations with the Soviets. After Faisal II was overthrown in a [[military coup]] on [[14 July Revolution|14 July 1958]], the newly proclaimed [[Republic of Iraq]] led by General [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] re-established relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union began selling arms to [[Baghdad]].<REF name="mid"/><ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> 

Since then, for about forty years until the Gorbachev [[perestroika]] in the late 1980s, Soviet-Iraqi cooperation was both close and multi-faceted, and for most of the period it was even officially called a "strategic partnership". However, this did not mean that during all that time their mutual relations had always been equally friendly and without serious political differences. As an American scholar indicated, because of their support of the national-liberation movements, a number of important Third World countries, including Iraq, "declared their friendship for and improved relations with the USSR and sided with it on a number of international problems". In no instance, however, did their leaders "compromise their own national interests or become Soviet stooges."<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> Baghdad's interest in cooperation with Moscow "was based on the need for a powerful patron in its efforts to shed all the remnants of [[Colonialism|Western colonialism]] and to establish Iraq as an autonomous member of the world order of nation states."<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/> At the same time, however, the Iraqi "ruling elite had shown stubborn resistance towards anything which could be regarded as an intrusion into the country's internal affairs or as an infringement upon Iraq's sovereignty over its international policies."<ref name=Russian-IraqiRelations/>

===Iraqi occupation of Kuwait===

The Soviet Union was critical of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[August 2]], [[1990]] [[Invasion of Kuwait|invasion and occupation of Kuwait]], and supported a [[United Nations]] resolution authorizing the use of military force, if necessary, to enforce an arms embargo against Iraq.  But the Soviet Union's military support for Saddam also drew substantial criticism from the [[United States]] and other western nations.  In [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy experts Jay P. Kosminsky and Michael Johns wrote on [[August 30]], 1990 that, "While condemning the Iraqi invasion, [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] continues to assist Saddam militarily.  By Moscow's own admission, at an [[August 22]] official press conference by [[Red Army]] Colonel Valentin Ogurtsov, 193 Soviet military advisors still are training and assisting Iraq's one million-man armed forces.  Privately, [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] sources say that between 3,000 and 4,000 Soviet military advisors may be in Iraq."<ref>[http://www.heritage.org/dataconvert/pdf/em0280.pdf "Bush to Gorbachev: Choose Between Saddam and the West," by Jay P. Kosminsky and Michael Johns, Heritage Foundation Executive Memorandum #280, August 30, 1990.]</ref>
