'''Hanu<U+0161> Wihan''' (5 June 1855 &ndash; 1 May 1920) was a renowned Czech cellist, considered the greatest of his time.<ref name=quartet>[http://www.wihanquartet.com/biographs/Wihanpop.html Wihan Quartet]</ref> He was strongly associated with the works of [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]], whose Rondo in G minor, Op. 94, the short piece [[Silent Woods (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|Silent Woods, Op. 68]], and most particularly the [[Cello Concerto (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104]] were all dedicated to him.  He was the founder and later cellist of the [[Bohemian Quartet|Czech String Quartet]], which was world-famous throughout its 40-year existence.

==Biography==
Hanu<U+0161> Wihan was born in [[Police nad Metuj<U+00ED>]] and studied with [[Franti<U+0161>ek Hegenbarth]] (1881<U+2013>87) at the [[Prague Conservatory]]  from the age of 13<ref name=campbell>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=44-BX0GpoxwC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=hanus+wihan&source=bl&ots=gWMbl14aWk&sig=7LNB5Yg0516FpNJXng64Nqr3pVs&hl=en&ei=Kam8SaTBL5im6wPTuP3qBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA58,M1 Margaret Campbell, The Great Cellists]</ref>, finishing his studies with [[Karl Davydov]] at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St. Petersburg Conservatory]].<ref name=maisky>[http://www2.deutschegrammophon.com/special/insights.htms?ID=maisky-morgen Maisky-Gililov]</ref>  He became a teacher at the [[Mozarteum University of Salzburg|Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]] at 18.  He joined the private orchestra of a Russian patron in [[Nice]] and [[Lugano]], then went to Benjamin Bilse<U+2019>s orchestra in [[Berlin]] (the forerunner of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]) for a year, where the leader was his compatriot [[Karel Hal<U+00ED><U+0159>]]<ref name=wihan>[http://www.cellist.nl/database/showcellist.asp?id=682 www.cellist.nl]</ref>;  then to Prince Schwarzenburg<U+2019>s orchestra in [[Sondershausen]], where he became a close friend of [[Franz Liszt]], and to the court orchestra in [[Munich]], in which [[Franz Strauss]] was the first horn.<ref name=maisky/>   He remained in Munich for eight years, joining the circles of [[Hans von B<U+00FC>low]], [[Richard Wagner]] (who hired him to play at the [[Bayreuth Festival]]<ref name=maisky/>) and Franz Strauss's son [[Richard Strauss|Richard]].  Richard Strauss dedicated to Wihan his String Quartet in A, Op. 2<ref name=maisky/> and Cello Sonata in F, Op. 6 (which Wihan premiered in [[Nuremberg]] on 8 December 1883).  He also wrote the Romance for Cello and Orchestra for Wihan, but did not dedicate it to him; Wihan premiered it on 15 February 1884 in [[Baden-Baden]].<ref name=maisky/>  

By this time Hanu<U+0161> Wihan was married to Dora (n<U+00E9>e Weis), a pianist from [[Dresden]]. Dora fell in love with Richard Strauss, who was five years younger than her.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=0MFx0rA4tdgC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=hanus+wihan&source=bl&ots=ADi5N5Rosj&sig=u8Ru6NRHxcKIwjh7qRlMYSDA80U&hl=en&ei=JLG8SdrAL4bAkAXOzcm0CA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA37,M1 Michael Kennedy, Richard Strauss]</ref>  There is no evidence that the affair was consummated or was ever going to be, but Wihan was very jealous by nature and it led to Dora's and Hanu<U+0161>'s marriage breaking up.<ref name=maisky/> He then returned to his alma mater in Prague.  

He had a highly successful career as a virtuoso and teacher, succeeding his teacher Hegenbarth in 1888, and toured widely as a soloist and a chamber musician, particularly in Russia from 1894.  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] heard him perform in a concert in Prague in 1888 and offered to help arrange some appearances in Russia.  He also frequently sought advice from [[Karl Davydov]], and maintained regular correspondence with both Davydov and Tchaikovsky.<ref name=wihan>[http://www.cellist.nl/database/showcellist.asp?id=682 Hanus Wihan, cellist]</ref>

In 1891 Hanu<U+0161> Wihan formed the [[Bohemian Quartet|Bohemian String Quartet]] with violinists [[Karel Hoffmann]] and [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]], and violist [[Oskar Nedbal]] <U+2013> all pupils of [[Anton<U+00ED>n Bennewitz]] <U+2013> and his own cello pupil [[Otakar Berger]].  He did not play with them at first, but instilled in them his own ideas and managed their appearances.  In 1892 the name Czech String Quartet was adopted.  Wihan filled the void when Otakar Berger fell ill in 1893 and joined the ensemble permanently after Berger's death in 1897.  The Quartet toured in many European countries, became strongly associated with [[Bed<U+0159>ich Smetana]]'s [[String Quartet No. 1 (Smetana)|String Quartet No. 1 in E minor ''From My Life'']], and [[Sergei Taneyev]] in Russia was particularly impressed, played with them on various occasions, and dedicated his 4th String Quartet to them.<ref name=wihan/>

In 1892 Wihan went on a five-month tour of Czech towns with [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]] and [[Ferdinand Lachner]], during which Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k wrote the Rondo in G minor, which Wihan premiered in [[Chrudim]].  The trio also premiered Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k's [[Piano Trio No. 4 (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|Dumky Trio]] (1891).<ref name=quartet/>  

Wihan had asked Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k to write a cello concerto for him, but the composer had always maintained a concerto was not the best way of displaying a cello's strengths, as it would be swamped by the orchestra. However, in 1894-95, Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k wrote the [[Cello Concerto (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|Cello Concerto in B minor]] in [[New York]], with Hanu<U+0161> Wihan's playing in mind.<ref name=bso>[http://www.bso.org/images/program_notes/20081113.pdf Boston Symphony Orchestra program notes]</ref> Wihan made various suggestions for improvement, some of which Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k accepted.  But he would not accept Wihan's suggested cadenza for the final movement as it clashed with his idea of the movement as a tribute to his seriously ill sister-in-law.<ref name=bso/> It was intended that Wihan would perform the premiere of the work in London on 19 March 1896, but his contractual obligations with the Czech String Quartet clashed with the only possible date for the premiere.  The soloist was the little-known [[Leo Stern]]. There was no truth to a rumour that the two men had any sort of falling out over the matter. Wihan did perform the concerto in [[The Hague]] (under [[Willem Mengelberg]]<ref name=quartet/>, or Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k<ref name=campbell/>), [[Amsterdam]] and [[Budapest]] (the last under the composer's baton)<ref name=campbell/><ref name=wihan/>, and he took part in the premiere of Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k's G major Quartet, Op. 106, that year.<ref name=maisky/>  Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k's original score, before it was altered with Wihan's suggested changes, has been described as "much more musical", and this version has been performed from time to time.<ref>[http://www.cello.org/Newsletter/Articles/fingers/fingers.htm Dimitry Markevitch, Some Thoughts on More Rational Cello Fingerings]</ref>

Wihan had been playing with the Czech String Quartet for some years, and in the latter stages of his career he reduced his appearances as soloist and chamber musician and appeared with the Quartet exclusively.  In 1906 [[Lionel Tertis]] worked with the Quartet, and noticed Wihan's habit of spitting on the floor during rehearsals.<ref name=maisky/> He retired in 1914, but arranged to be paid 20 per cent of the Quartet's earnings until his death.<ref name=quartet/> He was replaced in the Quartet by Ladislav Zelenka.  In 1919, on the reorganization of the Prague Conservatory, he was appointed professor of chamber music and professor of the cello, and retained these posts until his death the following year.  His pupils included Artur Kr<U+00E1>sa, Otakar Berger, Jan Burian, Julius Junek, Rudolf Pavlata, Maximilian <U+0160>kvor, and Bed<U+0159>ich Vaska.<ref name=wihan/>

He died aged 64 on 1 May 1920, the exact anniversary of Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k's death in 1904.

In 1985 the [[Wihan Quartet]] was established in memory of Hanu<U+0161> Wihan by members of the Prague Academy.<ref>[http://www.wihanquartet.com/quarnews/2007/01/new-dvd-and-reviews-january-07.html Wihan Quartet News]</ref>
