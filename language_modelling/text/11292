In 1943 the house was bought by the Miners<U+2019> Welfare Commission and it became a rehabilitation centre for injured miners.  In 1951 it became part of the [[National Health Service]], initially for rehabilitation for people injured in industrial accidents, and later for rehabilitation for all groups of people, including children.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.coch.org/history/oakmerehospital.html#TOP |title=Oakmere Rehabilitation Centre & Hospital |accessdate=2008-03-10 |publisher=[[National Health Service]] }}</ref>  It is now privately owned and has been divided into residential apartments.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===

The house is built in [[Freestone (masonry)|freestone]] from [[Lancashire]] in [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] style with roofs of [[Westmorland]] slate.<ref name=bevan/>  It is in two storeys with a nine-bay west (garden) front.  The entrance is behind a two-storey [[porte-cochere|porte-coch<U+00E8>re]] which has been finished as a [[gatehouse]].  This is flanked by octagonal [[pilaster]]s which end as [[turret]]s and on the first floor there is an [[oriel window]].  At the right of the west (entrance) front is a circular projection with a tall conical roof and at the left end is an octagonal turret with a tall pyramidal roof.  The east front includes a massive three-storey tower with an [[battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]] and a truncated pyramidal roof with a [[wrought iron]] [[Baluster|balustrade]].  The tower has an additional octagonal turret.<ref name=images/>

===Interior===

In the original ground-floor plan, the porte-coch<U+00E8>re led into the entrance hall with the staircase hall on its right.  To the right of these were two [[drawing room]]s and in front of halls, overlooking the garden, was the [[dining room]].  To the left were the servants' quarters with a [[billiard room]] at the extreme left on the first floor.  Considerable alterations were made in the 20th century to the interior of the house to adapt it for its later purposes.<ref name=hubbard/>
