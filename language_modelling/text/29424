A '''white dwarf''', also called a '''degenerate dwarf''', is a [[Compact star|stellar remnant]] composed mostly of [[electron-degenerate matter]]. They are very [[density|dense]]; a white dwarf's mass is comparable to that of the [[Sun]], and its volume is comparable to that of the [[Earth]]. Its faint [[luminosity]] comes from the [[Thermal radiation|emission]] of stored [[heat|thermal energy]].<ref name="osln" /> The nearest known white dwarf is [[Sirius B]], 8.6 light years away, the smaller component of the Sirius [[binary star]]. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun.<ref>

The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy, nor is it supported by the heat generated by fusion against [[gravitational collapse]]. It is supported only by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]<U+2014>approximately 1.4 [[solar mass]]es<U+2014>beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure.

A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed, but since it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool.

== Discovery ==

The first white dwarf discovered was in the [[triple star system]] of [[40 Eridani]], which contains the relatively bright [[main sequence]] star [[40 Eridani A]], orbited at a distance by the closer [[binary star|binary system]] of the white dwarf [[40 Eridani B]] and the [[main sequence]] [[red dwarf]] [[40 Eridani C]]. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on 31 January 1783;<ref>

<blockquote>I was visiting my friend and generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With characteristic kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars<U+2014>including comparison stars<U+2014>which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful<U+2014>it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once that there was an extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called "possible" values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study!</blockquote>

The spectral type of 40 Eridani B was officially described in 1914 by [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter Adams]].<ref>

The companion of [[Sirius]], [[Sirius|Sirius B]], was next to be discovered. During the nineteenth century, positional measurements of some stars became precise enough to measure small changes in their location. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel|Friedrich Bessel]] used position measurements to determine that the stars Sirius (<U+03B1> Canis Majoris) and [[Procyon]] (<U+03B1> Canis Minoris) were changing their positions periodically. In 1844 he predicted that both stars had unseen companions:<ref name="fwbessel">

<blockquote>If we were to regard ''Sirius'' and ''Procyon'' as double stars, the change of their motions would not surprise us; we should acknowledge them as necessary, and have only to investigate their amount by observation. But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.</blockquote>

White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a [[binary star|binary]] system, as is the case for Sirius B and 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910,<ref>

As Eddington pointed out in 1924, densities of this order implied that, according to the theory of [[general relativity]], the light from Sirius B should be [[gravitational redshift|gravitationally redshifted]].<ref name="eddington">

New research indicates that many white dwarfs<U+2014>at least in certain types of galaxies<U+2014>may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated that at least some of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in elliptical galaxies such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that less x-rays than expected are produced by the white dwarfs' accretion of matter. 30 to 50 times more x-rays would be expected to be produced by an amount of matter falling onto a population of accreting white dwarfs sufficient to produce supernovae at the observed rate. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as [[standard candle]]s in determining distances across the universe.<ref>

===Mass<U+2013>radius relationship and mass limit===
It is simple to derive a rough relationship between the mass and radii of white dwarfs using an energy minimization argument. The energy of the white dwarf can be approximated by taking it to be the sum of its gravitational [[potential energy]] and [[kinetic energy]]. The gravitational potential energy of a unit mass piece of white dwarf, {{math|''E''<sub>g</sub>}}, will be on the order of {{math|<U+2212>''G''<U+2009>''M''<U+2009><U+2215><U+2009>''R''}}, where {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]], ''M'' is the mass of the white dwarf, and {{mvar|R}} is its radius. The kinetic energy of the unit mass, {{math|''E''<sub>k</sub>}}, will primarily come from the motion of electrons, so it will be approximately {{math|''N''<U+2009>''p''<sup>2</sup><U+2009><U+2215><U+2009>2''m''}}, where {{mvar|p}} is the average electron momentum, {{mvar|m}} is the electron mass, and {{mvar|N}} is the number of electrons per unit mass. Since the electrons are [[degenerate matter|degenerate]], we can estimate {{mvar|p}} to be on the order of the uncertainty in momentum, {{math|<U+0394>''p''}}, given by the [[uncertainty principle]], which says that {{math|<U+0394>''p''<U+2009><U+0394>''x''}} is on the order of the [[reduced Planck constant]], <!-- something broken with {{math}} at this character, skipping it -->''<U+0127>''. {{math|<U+0394>''x''}} will be on the order of the average distance between electrons, which will be approximately {{math|''n''<sup><U+2212>1/3</sup>}}, i.e., the reciprocal of the cube root of the number density, {{mvar|n}}, of electrons per unit volume. Since there are {{math|''N''<U+2009>''M''}} electrons in the white dwarf and its volume is on the order of {{math|''R''<sup>3</sup>}}, {{mvar|n}} will be on the order of {{math|''N''<U+2009>''M''<U+2009><U+2215><U+2009>''R''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name="scibits">

Solving for the kinetic energy per unit mass, ''E''<sub>k</sub>, we find that
::<math>E_k \approx \frac{N (\Delta p)^2}{2m} \approx \frac{N \hbar^2 n^{2/3}}{2m} \approx \frac{M^{2/3} N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m R^2}.</math>
The white dwarf will be at equilibrium when its total energy, {{math|''E''<sub>g</sub> + ''E''<sub>k</sub>}}, is minimized. At this point, the kinetic and gravitational potential energies should be comparable, so we may derive a rough mass-radius relationship by equating their magnitudes:
::<math>|E_g|\approx\frac{GM}{R} = E_k\approx\frac{M^{2/3} N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m R^2}.</math>
Solving this for the radius, {{mvar|R}}, gives<ref name="scibits" />
::<math> R \approx \frac{N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m GM^{1/3}}.</math>
Dropping {{mvar|N}}, which depends only on the composition of the white dwarf, and the universal constants leaves us with a relationship between mass and radius:
::<math>R \sim \frac{1}{M^{1/3}}, \,</math>
i.e., the radius of a white dwarf is inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass.

Since this analysis uses the non-relativistic formula {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup><U+2009><U+2215><U+2009>2''m''}} for the kinetic energy, it is non-relativistic. If we wish to analyze the situation where the electron velocity in a white dwarf is close to the [[speed of light]], {{mvar|c}}, we should replace {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup><U+2009><U+2215><U+2009>2''m''}} by the extreme relativistic approximation {{math|''p''<U+2009>''c''}} for the kinetic energy. With this substitution, we find
::<math>E_{k\ {\rm relativistic}} \approx \frac{M^{1/3} N^{4/3} \hbar c}{R}.</math>
If we equate this to the magnitude of {{math|''E''<sub>g</sub>}}, we find that {{mvar|R}} drops out and the mass, {{mvar|M}}, is forced to be<ref name="scibits" />
::<math>M_{\rm limit} \approx N^2 \left(\frac{\hbar c}{G}\right)^{3/2}.</math>

[[Image:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|thumb|350px|right|Radius<U+2013>mass relations for a model white dwarf. {{math|''M''<sub>limit</sub>}} is denoted as M<sub>Ch</sub>]]
To interpret this result, observe that as we add mass to a white dwarf, its radius will decrease, so, by the uncertainty principle, the momentum, and hence the velocity, of its electrons will increase. As this velocity approaches {{mvar|c}}, the extreme relativistic analysis becomes more exact, meaning that the mass&nbsp;{{mvar|M}} of the white dwarf must approach {{math|''M''<sub>limit</sub>}}. Therefore, no white dwarf can be heavier than the limiting mass {{math|''M''<sub>limit</sub>}}, or 1.4 Solar masses.

For a more accurate computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the [[equation of state]] which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius from the center of the star, the system of equations consisting of the [[hydrostatic equation]] together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass.<ref name="chandra2" /><sup>, eq. (80)</sup> Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass<U+2014>called the ''[[Chandrasekhar limit]]''<U+2014>at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold [[Fermi gas]] in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, {{math|''<U+03BC>''<sub>e</sub>}}, has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.<ref name="chandra2" /><ref name="stds">

===Radiation and cooling===
The degenerate matter that makes up the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], because any absorption of a photon requires an electron transition to a higher empty state, which may not be available given the energy of the photon; it also has a high [[thermal conductivity]]. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a constant temperature, approximately 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;K. However, an outer shell of non-degenerate matter cools from approximately 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;K to 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;K. This matter radiates roughly as a [[black body]] to determine the visible color of the white dwarf. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, because it radiates as a roughly 10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;K body, while its interior is at 10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;K.<ref>

The [[white dwarf luminosity function]] can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of the [[Galactic disk]] found in this way is 8 billion years.<ref name="disklf" />

A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillion years, cool and become a non-radiating ''[[black dwarf]]'' in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the [[cosmic background radiation]]. However, no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.<ref name="osln" />

=== Atmosphere and spectra ===
Although most white dwarfs are thought to be composed of carbon and oxygen, [[spectroscopy]] typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either [[hydrogen]]-dominated or [[helium]]-dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by [[Evry Schatzman|Schatzman]] in the 1940s, the high [[surface gravity]] is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are on the bottom and lighter ones on top.<ref>

Although thin, these outer layers determine the thermal evolution of the white dwarf. The degenerate [[electron]]s in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore almost [[isothermal]], and it is also hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000&nbsp;K and 16,000&nbsp;K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000&nbsp;K and 20,000,000&nbsp;K.

* A white dwarf with only [[Spectroscopic notation|He I]] lines in its spectrum and an effective temperature of 15,000&nbsp;K could be given the classification of DB3, or, if warranted by the precision of the temperature measurement, DB3.5.
* A white dwarf with a polarized [[magnetic field]], an effective temperature of 17,000&nbsp;K, and a spectrum dominated by [[Spectroscopic notation|He I]] lines which also had [[hydrogen]] features could be given the classification of DBAP3.

=== Stars with low to medium mass ===
If the mass of a main-sequence star is between approximately 0.5 and 8 solar masses, its core will become sufficiently hot to fuse [[helium]] into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] via the [[triple-alpha process]], but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse [[carbon]] into [[neon]]. Near the end of the period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon-oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, it will be found on the [[asymptotic giant branch]]. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a [[planetary nebula]], until only the carbon-oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon-oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.<ref name="sj" /><ref name="vd1">[http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy213/phy213_lowmass.html the evolution of low-mass stars], Vik Dhillon, lecture notes, Physics 213, University of Sheffield.

=== Stars with medium to high mass ===
If a star is massive enough, its core will eventually become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, and then to fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point the core of the star will [[gravitational collapse|collapse]] and it will explode in a [[core-collapse supernova]] which will leave behind a remnant [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or possibly a more exotic form of [[compact star]].<ref name="evo" /><ref>

There is a planet in the white dwarf-[[pulsar]] binary system [[PSR B1620-26]].

== Habitability ==

It has been proposed that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 Kelvin could harbor a [[habitable zone]] at a distance between ~0.005 to 0.02 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] that would last 3 billion years. The goal is to search for [[transit (astronomy)|transits]] of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong [[eclipse]]s.;<ref>

The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they're unlikely to survive to being absorbed and the conditions they'd find on the deep interior of their stars, and in the latter case they'd have to get rid of so much orbital energy as heat that they'd likely end as an unhabitable ember, even if at first they weren't so.<ref>{{cite journal

}}</ref> White dwarfs in [[binary (astronomy)|binary]] systems, however, can accrete material from a companion star, increasing both their mass and their density. As their mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, this could theoretically lead to either the explosive ignition of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] in the white dwarf or its collapse into a [[neutron star]].<ref name="collapse" />

Accretion provides the currently favored mechanism, the ''single-degenerate model'', for [[Type Ia supernovae]]. In this model, a [[carbon]]<U+2013>[[oxygen]] white dwarf accretes material from a companion star,<ref name="sniamodels" /><sup>, p.&nbsp;14.</sup> increasing its mass and compressing its core.

Rather, the increased temperature accelerates the rate of the fusion reaction, in a   [[thermal runaway|runaway]] process that feeds on itself. The [[thermonuclear]] flame consumes much of the white dwarf in a few seconds, causing a Type Ia supernova explosion that obliterates the star.<ref name="osln" /><ref name="sniamodels" /><ref>

Observations have failed to note signs of accretion leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very fast rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows down until the spin is no longer fast enough to prevent the explosion.<ref>O'Neill, Ian.

=== Cataclysmic variables ===
{{Main|Cataclysmic variable star}}
Before accretion of material pushes a white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit, accreted [[hydrogen]]-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by [[Nuclear fusion|hydrogen fusion]]. Since the white dwarf's core remains intact, these surface explosions can be repeated as long as accretion continues. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) [[nova]]. Astronomers have also observed [[dwarf nova]]e, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of [[gravitational potential energy]] when part of the [[accretion disc]] collapses onto the star, rather than by fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called [[cataclysmic variable]]s. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known.<ref name="osln" /><ref name="sniamodels" /><ref name="nasa1">[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/cataclysmic_variables.html Imagine the Universe!
