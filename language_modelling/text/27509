To prepare for the NFL Draft (and contract negotiations) Suh signed with Maximum Sports Management, and agent Roosevelt Barnes, who would serve as Suh's lead agent. This caused moderate concern for many teams who were hoping to draft him, as this was the same agent who represented [[Michael Crabtree]]. Crabtree was the longest [[2009 NFL Draft]] 1st round contract hold out, waiting over six weeks into the NFL season before signing with the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. He even threatened to re-enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]].

Suh was selected second overall in the [[2010 NFL Draft]] by the Detroit Lions, the first defensive lineman the franchise selected in the first round since [[Luther Elliss]] in [[1995 NFL Draft|1995]]. Suh was the highest selected Cornhusker defender since [[Neil Smith (American football)|Neil Smith]] in [[1988 NFL Draft|1988]].

====2011====
In the 2011 season on week 14 against the [[Oakland Raiders]], Suh jumped up to block the game winning field goal, to make the Lions 9<U+2013>5<U+2013>0.

Suh was named a [[Pro Bowl]] alternate for the NFC after the 2011 NFL season.<ref>{{citation|date=January 6, 2012|title=Stafford, Suh, and Delmas named Pro Bowl alternates|url=
http://www.detroitlions.com/news/lions-insider/article-1/Stafford-Suh-and-Delmas-named-Pro-Bowl-alternates/76971202-e7e6-41e4-9545-75656672329f|work=detroitlions.com}}</ref>

During the third quarter of the Lions' [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] against the [[Green Bay Packers]] on November 24, 2011, Suh pushed Packers' offensive lineman [[Evan Dietrich-Smith]]'s head into the ground three times, then stomped on his arm.  All of this took place after the whistle was blown. Suh was penalized for unnecessary roughness and ejected from the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/48903/case-closed-on-ndamukong-suh|title=Case closed on Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-24|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>  The resulting penalty gave the Packers an automatic first down. The Packers would score a touchdown two plays later, giving them a 14<U+2013>0 lead and an eventual 27<U+2013>15 victory.

Initially, Suh denied stomping on Dietrich-Smith, saying he was only trying to get his balance back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/34877/verbatim-ndamukong-suh|title=Verbatim: Ndamukong Suh|author=Kevin Seifert|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-26|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>  However, on Friday morning, the Lions issued a statement calling Suh's actions "unacceptable."  Within hours, Suh wrote on his Facebook page that he'd "made a mistake" a day before and intended to learn from it.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7278879/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-apologizes-stomp-says-learned-situation  Ndamukong Suh apologizes for stomp]. [[ESPN]], 2011-11-26.</ref> [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] NFL rules analyst and former vice president of officiating [[Mike Pereira]] said that based on his knowledge of league discipline, "the question won<U+2019>t be if the NFL will suspend Suh, but when <U+2014> and for how many games."  He drew parallels between Suh's actions and those of [[Albert Haynesworth]], who drew a five-game suspension<U+2014>the longest suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history<U+2014>for stomping on [[Andre Gurode]]'s head in 2006.<ref name=Pereira/>

On November 29, the NFL suspended Suh for two games without pay. In announcing the decision, [[Roger Goodell]] noted that it was the fifth time Suh had been disciplined for on-field conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Ndamukong-Suh-Detroit-Lions-NFL-suspension-two-games-for-stomping-incident-112911|title=Lions' Suh appealing 2-game suspension|author=Jay Glazer|authorlink=Jay Glazer|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]}}</ref> Soon after the suspension was handed down, Suh announced he would appeal the decision.  The NFL held an expedited hearing before former [[Oakland Raiders]] coach [[Art Shell]], so that a decision could be handed down before the Lions' next game, on December 4, against the [[New Orleans Saints]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7293935/ndamukong-suh-detroit-lions-suspended-two-games-pay|title=Source: Ndamukong Suh appeals ban|date=November 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-29|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref>  The appeal was turned down on December 2, forcing Suh to sit out the game against the Saints and the December 11 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7307624/detroit-lions-ndamukong-suh-appeal-denied-miss-two-games Ndamukong Suh's appeal denied].  [[ESPN]], 2011-12-02.</ref> Suh finished the 2011 season with 4 sacks, a pass defended, and 26 tackles.

====2012====
During a Thanksgiving game on November 22, 2012, Suh was involved in a play in which he kicked [[Houston Texans]] quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] in the groin. The incident resulted in a $30,000 fine from the league, nearly double the mandated fine for a second offense of "striking/kicking/kneeing" an opponent.<ref name=McIntyre>{{cite web|last=McIntyre|first=Brian|title=NFL fines Ndamukong Suh $30,000 for kick to Matt Schaub<U+2019>s groin|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/nfl-fines-ndamukong-suh-30-000-kick-matt-213759804--nfl.html|date=November 28, 2012|work=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref> There was speculation the size of the fine was recognition by the league of Suh's history of questionable on-field hits, while others viewed it as a "wishy-washy" and "cop-out" action by the league in issuing a large fine without a suspension.<ref name=McIntyre/><ref name=SI>{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh fined $30K in wishy-washy decision by NFL|url=http://nfl.si.com/2012/11/28/ndamukong-suh-fined-30k-in-wishy-washy-decision-by-nfl/|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=December 30, 2012|date=November 28, 2012}}</ref>

In issuing the fine, Roger Goodell stated, "<U+201C>Any time you see a play like that, you want to say, <U+2018>Why did it happen?<U+2019> It<U+2019>s hard for us to be able to determine that just from video. Those are the things that sometimes you have to talk to Ndamukong in this case, or the player, but intent is something that<U+2019>s very difficult for us to ever try to make a judgment on.<U+201D><ref name=SI/> Suh denied the kick was intentional, stating his foot inadvertently hit Schaub as he was being dragged to the ground.<ref name=SI/> Suh finished 2012 with 8 sacks, 2 passes defended, and 25 tackles in 16 games (15 starts).

====2013====
In the Lions' Week 1 victory over the [[Minnesota Vikings]], 34<U+2013>24, Suh low blocked [[John Sullivan (American football)|John Sullivan]] during a [[DeAndre Levy]] "[[Interception returned for touchdown|pick 6]]"; the resulting [[Personal foul (football)|personal foul]] nullified Levy's touchdown. Two days after the game, Suh was fined $100,000 for the hit<U+2014>which, not counting lost pay for suspensions, is the largest fine ever issued to a player for on-the-field actions. He would appeal the fine but the ruling was later upheld by the NFL,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ndamukong Suh loses appeal of $100,000 fine|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/12/ndamukong-suh-loses-appeal-of-100000-fine/|work=NBC|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref> which brought the total fines levied against Suh to $177,500.<ref>http://www.freep.com/article/20130910/SPORTS01/309100125/detroit-lions-ndamukong-suh-nfl</ref>

In the Lions' Week 6 victory over the [[Cleveland Browns]], Suh tackled Browns QB Brandon Weeden in a questionable manner. Though not called for a penalty during the game, Suh was later fined $31,500 by the NFL. This brought the total fines levied against him to $209,000.

During a Thanksgiving game against the Packers on November 28, 2013, Suh sacked [[Matt Flynn]] in the end zone, forcing a safety for the first time of his career. On November 29, 2013, Suh was fined $7,875 for performing a throat slash during a game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. This now brought the total fines levied against him to $216,875.

===Style of play===
Suh has been criticized in the media and by other players for his aggressive style of play and has been fined a total of $216,875 by the league for four violations in the first four years in his career. In a poll of fellow players conducted by the ''[[Sporting News]]'', Suh was named "the dirtiest player" in the NFL.<ref>[http://www.foxsportsdetroit.com/11/08/11/Suh-voted-dirtiest-player-by-his-peers/landing_lions.html?blockID=599388&feedID=3862 Suh voted 'dirtiest player' by his peers].
