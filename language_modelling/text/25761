Produced by [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] and Junction Entertainment, with executive producers [[Jon Turteltaub]], [[Stephen Chbosky]], and [[Carol Barbee]], the show was <!-- This one should be in the past tense since it has been cancelled. --> broadcast in more than 30 countries.

The show ran on [[CBS]] from September 20, 2006, through March 25, 2008. It was initially canceled after its first full season because of poor ratings. While a fan campaign was able to convince the network to bring the show back for a seven-episode second season, it was canceled for a second time after that run. In November 2008, ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported that the [[The CW|CW television network]] would air repeats of ''Jericho'' to replace the canceled series ''[[Valentine (TV series)|Valentine]]''.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/News/CW-Cancels-Sunday-1000047.aspx CW Cancels Sunday Slate, Fills Gap with Jericho Repeats!]" ''TV Guide''.

==Synopsis==

===First season===
The storyline centers on the residents of Jericho, a small northwest [[Kansas]] town, in the aftermath of nuclear attacks on [[Locations in Jericho (TV series)|23 major cities]] in the United States. The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in nearby [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government. However, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.

While the first few episodes are centered around restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power) built in New Bern's factory for supplies: food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). However, relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the mayor eventually declares war, leading to the season's climactic end.

Several themes regularly addressed in the show included the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood, and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack, and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.

The pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake Green fled the town of Jericho five years earlier when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. Jake briefly returns home to claim his inheritance before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It will be revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack, but how he came to this and exactly what side he is on remains anything but clear.

===Second season===
[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|200px|right|Flag of the ''Allied States of America'']]
The military forces of the new ''Allied States of America (ASA)'', which now govern most of what was formerly the Western United States, have restored order to Jericho and its surrounding region, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normalcy returns to town, the plot shifts away from the day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.

Known only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act, but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, to piece together the trail of evidence, and, ultimately, to bring the truth to light before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.

Meanwhile, Jericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Initially welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], under the leadership of a private security contracting firm, Ravenwood, in turn owned by the company Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to, and sponsors, the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of open revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder, and the embezzlement.

Hawkins unsuccessfully attempts to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and, after a brief chase, seize the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes. The ASA military then transport the weapon to Cheyenne for safe keeping.

Hawkins makes contact with Jake, and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the Eastern United States, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]], and the Allied States; the ambassador manages to secure a small jet to carry Jake, Hawkins, and the device there. While en route, two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighter jets intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear, and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence, and Hawkins ominously intones that a Second American Civil War was always coming, and that the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.

===Third season===
[[Jericho Season 3|Season 3]] is not a live-action show, but a six-part comic book series "from the minds" of the original Jericho production team and written by the Jericho writing team. 

In April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing: "You know William Morris Endeavor Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they<U+2019>ve been talking to Netflix and you never know. I can<U+2019>t say what it will be in season 3, but I<U+2019>m excited for the new developments."<ref name="JerichoSeason3">[http://www.seriable.com/jericho-netflix-season-3-update-could-series-mount-a-nuts-return/ JERICHO Netflix Season 3 Update <U+2014> Could Series Mount A Nuts Return?] Seriable: April 13, 2013</ref>

===Fourth season===
Season 4 is a continuation of the comic book series that was released by IDW Publishing on August 15, 2012. The five issue story picked up after the events of Jericho: Season Three. The comic is written by Kalinda Vazquez with the process being overseen by the original television series<U+2019> writers.<ref>http://www.idwpublishing.com/news/article/2284/</ref>

==Production==

===Early development===
The series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of "a little character drama" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters <U+2014> thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided instead to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.

One of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, "[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs." Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of "[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it." Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the "best of people," and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the "worst of people," and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing "lots of inspiration" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>

The first season of the show premiered Wednesday, September 20, 2006 and concluded with a [[cliffhanger]] episode on May 9, 2007.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Jericho episodes}}
Clips from the pilot episode became free to watch on [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! TV]] several weeks before the episode actually aired on television.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tv.yahoo.com/feature/fall06/?d=200|title=Yahoo! TV Fall 2006 Preview|accessdate=2006-10-11}}</ref> CBS is still showing most, but not all, of the ''Jericho'' episodes on their [[CBS Innertube|Innertube]] website as of January 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/innertube/|title=CBS.com Innertube|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> although they cannot be accessed from outside the U.S. CBS repeated the first three episodes on the Saturday nights following their original airings, as did Australia's Network Ten.

Each episode's opening title sequence is accompanied by an audio message in [[Morse code]]. The messages vary from generic references to cryptic clues, and are always related to the current episode in some way. The messages were broadcast at 15 [[words per minute]] at a [[frequency]] of 1000&nbsp;Hz. In addition to these messages, there is Morse code over the DVD menus. These messages say "Jericho Fans Made TV History." (Season 1) and "Thank You Fans For Making TV History" (Season 2). Also, in the [[Fallout (Jericho episode)|second episode]], Robert Hawkins received several additional Morse code messages through a [[Ham Radio]] that he was fixing.

==Web-based tie-ins==
An online companion to ''Jericho'' is called ''[[Beyond Jericho]]''. The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the "other survivors" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and "webisode" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.

CBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of "prequel" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.

===''Beyond Jericho''===
{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}
The first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.

===''Countdown''===
Starting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title=Jericho on CBS - Countdown}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, consisting primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].

The mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS's episode 8 plot summary reads: "A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video." The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The "shadowy military unit" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.

''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is very heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.

===''JenningsandRall.com''===
Created for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series. The site contains a wealth of information about the company's post-holocaust global operations, with significant hints regarding events in the show.

On November 1, 2008, the domain name jenningsandrall.com expired. The site can still be viewed, however, at [http://jenningsandrall.tomtooman.com/ jenningsandrall.tomtooman.com].

===''Tom Tooman''===
''Tom Tooman'' is an [[alternate reality game]] that CBS ran in conjunction with ''Jericho'' beginning in August 2007. The game began with a cryptic letter posted on a web site, supposedly from a Tom Tooman of [[Lame Deer, Montana|Lame Deer]], [[Montana]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20538|title=Tom Tooman discussion on Unfiction.com}}</ref> This letter was accompanied by a series of [[bar codes]], some with decimal numbers and others with [[Maya numerals|Mayan numbers]]. These numbers were used to create an [[IP address]] for a second website. More clues were released, as well as a [[blog]] on the CBS web site connecting the game with ''Jericho''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/community/blogs/tom_tooman/|title=Tom Tooman blog on CBS.com}}</ref> The game abruptly ended with the cancellation of the series, with no closure offered. A synopsis of the game and the puzzles appear at TomTooman.com.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tomtooman.com/|title=Tom Tooman synopsis and review}}</ref>
