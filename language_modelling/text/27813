As with Pan Fish, poor market conditions saw Fjord's [[stock|share]] price worsen dramatically in 2001, and with it the ability to pay off its debts.

===Merger===

With the creation of a much enlarged company complete, the Pan Fish management announced a complete change in its identity in December 2006.

==Criticism==
Marine Harvest has been criticised for destroying a large part of the [[weir]] Murray's Cauld on the [[River Ettrick]] in [[Selkirk]], Scotland, through what has been claimed to be inaction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefishsite.com/fishnews/3777/cauld-lands-in-even-deeper-water |title=Cauld lands in even deeper water |author=The Fish Site |date=2007-03-05 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> The company sold its nearby fish farm to a local businessman for <U+00A3>1 in July 2008, who has since been given permission to commence repair work on the weir.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.selkirkweekendadvertiser.co.uk/selkirknews/Cauld-comfort-as-major-repairs.4599726.jp|title= Cauld comfort as major repairs given the go-ahead|last=Keddie|first=Andrew|date=17 October 2008|work=[[Selkirk Weekend Advertiser]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>

Marine Harvest's operations have been severely affected in the south of [[Chile]], where millions of fish have died by the disease [[infectious salmon anemia]].<ref name=economiaynegocios>{{cite web |url=http://www.economiaynegocios.cl/noticias/noticias.asp?id=43540 |title=Brote en salmonera El Golfo en Ais<U+00E9>n confirma expansi<U+00F3>n del virus ISA |author=Econom<U+00ED>a y Negocios |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2008-10-26 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasegunda.com/ediciononline/economia/detalle/index.asp?idnoticia=396364 |title=Advierten que virus ISA se encuentra en m<U+00E1>s del 90% de salmones en Ays<U+00E9>n   |author=La Segunda |date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2008-10-26 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The rapid propagation of the virus has motivated the enterprise to sell some of its facilities, firing more than a thousand employees,<ref name=economiaynegocios /> with the aim of translating its installations further south to the [[Ais<U+00E9>n Region]]. [[Parasitism|Parasitic]], viral and fungal infections are all disseminated when the fish are stressed and the centres are too close together, and a spokesman for Marine Harvest recognized that his company was using too many [[antibiotic]]s in Chile and that fish pens were too close, contributing to the dissemination of the ISA virus.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/world/americas/27salmon.html?fta=y |title=Salmon Virus Indicts Chile<U+2019>s Fishing Methods |author=Barrionuevo, Alexei |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref>
