==Second Indochina War==

The name "Second Indochina War" places the conflict into context with other distinct, but related, and contiguous conflicts in Southeast Asia. Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are seen as the battlegrounds of a larger Indochinese conflict that began at the end of [[World War II]] and lasted until communist victory in 1975. This conflict can be viewed in terms of the demise of [[colonialism]] and its after-effects during the [[Cold War]].

==Vietnam Conflict==

The term "Vietnam Conflict" is largely a U.S. designation, it acknowledges that the [[United States Congress]] never declared war on North Vietnam. Legally, the President used his constitutional discretion<U+2014>supplemented by supportive resolutions in Congress<U+2014>to conduct what was said to be a <U+201C>police action<U+201D>.

"Resistance War against the American Empire to Save the Nation" is the term favored by North Vietnam; it is more of a saying than a name, and its meaning is self-evident.
