'''S<U+00E3>o Vicente''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "[[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]]"), also '''Son Visent''' or '''Son Sent''' in [[Cape Verdean Creole]], is one of the [[Barlavento]] [[island]]s of [[Cape Verde]]. It is located between the islands of [[Santo Ant<U+00E3>o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant<U+00E3>o]] and [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], with the [[Canal de S<U+00E3>o Vicente]] separating it from Santo Ant<U+00E3>o. The island is composed by a single administrative division, the [[S<U+00E3>o Vicente, Cape Verde (municipality)|S<U+00E3>o Vicente municipality]].

== Geography ==
The island is roughly [[rectangle|rectangular]] in shape with a surface area of ca. {{convert|227|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.  From east to west it measures {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} and from north to south no more than {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The terrain includes mountains in the west, the southwest, the south, the east-central and the north.  The area is flat in the north-central, the central part, the eastern part south of Calhau and the northern part in the Ba<U+00ED>a das Gatas area. The urban area of Mindelo is in the northern part. Much of the island is deforested.

Although [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, the island is quite flat. Its highest point is '''Monte Verde''' (Portuguese for [[green]] [[mountain]]) located in the northeast-central part with an altitude of {{convert|725|m|ft|}}.  Although a great amount of [[erosion]] has taken place, some craters still remain <U+2014> in particular near the bay of [[Mindelo]]. Other mountaintops include [[Monte Cara]] and [[Topona]].

=== Climate ===
The climate is mainly [[tropical]] and dry with the temperature around {{convert|24|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} all year round.  The ocean water temperature every year is between {{convert|22|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}} and {{convert|25|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}.  There are two seasons: November through July are mainly dry and windy, while August through October is the "rainy season".

== History ==
S<U+00E3>o Vicente was discovered on [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent]]'s Day ([[January 22]]) in 1462. Due to its lack of water, the island was initially used only as a cattle pasture by some proprietors of the neighboring island of [[Santo Ant<U+00E3>o]]. The island remained practically uninhabited until the middle of the 19th century. It was only in 1838, when a [[coal]] deposit was established in ''[[Mindelo|Porto Grande]]'' to supply ships on [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] routes, that the population started to grow rapidly. Due to the lack of rain and consequent lack of natural resources, the economy of S<U+00E3>o Vicente is based mainly on commerce and services.

== Population==
The population of S<U+00E3>o Vicente in the 2000 census was 67,163 of which 4,174 are rural. It is the second most populous island of Cape Verde. The annual [[population growth]] is around 2.7% (higher than the state (national) level of 2.4%). 94% of the population live in urban areas, higher than the Cape Verde's level of 54% and is the highest in all of Cape Verde.  The life expectancy is 62 for males and 65 for females, higher than other parts of Africa.  The birth and mortality rates are high.

The majority of the population are young; 66% of the population are under the age of 30, and 8.6% of the population are over the age of 60.  The island has 16,000 families, of which there are an average of 4 persons per household, lower than Cape Verde's level of 5 persons per household.  56% of the families live in houses, the other 30% live in poorly-built houses.

About only 11% of the families own automobiles, which is 7.4% of Cape Verde's level.

== Economy ==
The economy of the island was always based almost exclusively on [[commerce]] and services. Due to lack of rain, [[agriculture]] is at a subsistence level. Fishing has some relevance, but conditions prevent it from being more important, not only for the catch <U+2014> [[lobster]] <U+2014> but also for the associated industries: [[conserves]], drying and salting of fish, and [[naval construction]]. 

[[Porto Grande]] is the main port of Cape Verde, through which passes much of the country's imports. It has a terminal of containers, silos, and refrigeration units that make handling load overflow possible. There is also a modern seawater [[desalination]] plant, which provides water for public consumption and for naval shipyards. 

In the [[industrial sector]], the island presents an abundance of manpower, even though unskilled, resulting from the exodus of inhabitants of other islands to S<U+00E3>o Vicente. About 27% of the employed population is unskilled. Highly-qualified employees <U+2014> company executives, public administrators, and managers and directors <U+2014> make up less than 2% of employees. It is distinguished, however, by a bigger participation of women in decision-making positions than the national average. 

According to the 2000 census, the island of S<U+00E3>o Vicente has the largest unemployment rate of the country <U+2014> 23% <U+2014> while the national average is 17%. Unemployment affects women more than men. The industrial park of the island <U+2014> the Industrial Zone of the [[Lazareto]] <U+2014> concentrates diverse types of manufacturing, essentially due to foreign investment, in the activities of footwear, confections, and fish processing. 

In recent years, the National Center of Workmanship of Mindelo supports local craftsmen in the production and commercialization of ceramic parts, articles made of [[coconut]] rinds, and necklaces of shells and [[rocks]]. 

S<U+00E3>o Vicente has a great tradition in [[sports]]; from here many sports have spread to the remaining islands. [[Windsurfing]], for example, relies on the excellent conditions here. The beach of S<U+00E3>o Pedro is considered one of the best for windsurfing, as shown by the many world-class champions of the sport. [[Cycling]], walking trails and [[horseback riding]] are good ways to explore the island. The English influence on the island is still recognizable today in the [[golf]]: S<U+00E3>o Vicente has an excellent 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, [[tourism]] has excellent potential growth on S<U+00E3>o Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Ba<U+00ED>a das Gatas, [[Calhau]], and S<U+00E3>o Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.

S<U+00E3>o Vicente has churches, a post office, a few banks, shops (not as many as Praia), a hospital named '''Baptista de Sousa''' and squares (''[[pra<U+00E7>a]]s'')

== Education ==
54% of the island's population receive education.  Here are the schools and classrooms in S<U+00E3>o Vicente:
*'''Preschool''' - 25 daycares, the majority with a particular character, about 2,600 attendees between the ages of 1 and 6
*'''Primary Schools''' (1st year to 6th year) - 11,000 students in 225 classrooms with 379 teachers.
*'''Secondary Education''' (7th year to 12th year) - 8,000 students in 146 classrooms with 384 professors
*'''Post-Secondary Education''' -  has a proportion of individual post-secondary schools (1.7, against 1.1% of Cape Verde's level) including ISEMAS and ISCEE.

== Language ==
Other than [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] which is the primary language, [[Cape Verdean Creole]] is mainly spoken by the majority of the population.  The [[S<U+00E3>o Vicente Creole|S<U+00E3>o Vicente variant]] is known as ''Crioulo of S<U+00E3>o Vicente'' (in Portuguese) or ''Kriol d Sonsent'' (in Creole).
