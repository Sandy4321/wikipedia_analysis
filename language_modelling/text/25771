==History==
{{Main|Little Rock Nine}}
Built in 1927 at a cost of $1.5 million, '''Little Rock Senior High School''', later to be renamed Little Rock Central High, was hailed as the most expensive, most beautiful, and largest high school in the nation. Its opening earned national publicity with nearly 20,000 people attending the dedication ceremony. Historic events in the 1950s changed education at Central High School and throughout the United States.

LRCHS was the focal point of the [[Little Rock Integration Crisis]] of 1957.<ref name="arency" /> Nine African-American students, known as the [[Little Rock Nine]], were denied entrance to the school in defiance of the 1954 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling ordering [[Racial integration|integration]] of public schools.<ref name="arency" /> This provoked a showdown between the [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Orval Faubus]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] that gained international attention.<ref name="arency" />

On the morning of September 23, 1957, the nine African-American high school students faced an angry [[Crowd|mob]] of over 1,000 White Americans protesting integration in front of Central High School in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]].<ref name="arency" /> As the students were escorted inside by the Little Rock police, violence escalated and they were removed from the school.<ref name="arency" /> The next day, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the 1,200-man 101st Airborne Battle Group of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]] from [[Fort Campbell]], Kentucky, to escort the nine students into the school.<ref name="arency" /> By the same order, the entire 10,000 man Arkansas National Guard was federalized, to remove them from the control of Governor Faubus.<ref name="arency" /> At nearby Camp Robinson, a hastily organized Task Force 153rd Infantry drew guardsmen from units all over the state.<ref name="arency" /> Most of the Arkansas Guard was quickly demobilized, but the ad hoc TF153Inf assumed control at Thanksgiving when the 327th withdrew, and patrolled inside and outside the school for the remainder of the school year. As [[Melba Pattillo Beals]], one of the nine students, remembered, and quoted in her book, "After three full days inside Central [High School], I know that integration is a much bigger word than I thought."

[[Image:101st Airborne at Little Rock Central High.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the 101st US-Airborne Division escorting the Little Rock Nine to school.]] This event, watched by the nation and world, was the site of the first important test for the implementation of the U.S. Supreme Court<U+2019>s historic ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of 1954.<ref name="arency" /> Arkansas became the epitome of state resistance when the governor, Orval Faubus, directly questioned the authority of the federal court system and the validity of desegregation. The crisis at Little Rock's Central High School was the first fundamental test of the national resolve to enforce black civil rights in the face of [[massive resistance]] during the years following the Brown decision. As to whether Eisenhower's specific actions to enforce integration violated the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], the Supreme Court, in Cooper v. Aaron (1958), indirectly affirmed the legality of his conduct, which was never, though, expressly reviewed.<ref name="posse">{{cite web| title=Military Power in Law Enforcement: The Posse Comitatus| date=9 November 2005| url=http://law.onecle.com/constitution/article-2/40-military-power-in-law-enforcement.html| publisher=Law and Legal Research| accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>

In 1958, a US Federal Court judge suspended operation of the federal integration order until the 1960-61 school term.  Judge Hemley said integration had "broken down under the pressure of public opinion". The school board said it had faced large fees it could not afford for hiring security guards to keep the peace in school.<ref name="Sydney">{{cite news| title=1958| page=26| work=Sydney Morning Herald| date=23 June 2010| author=Malcolm Brown| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=2BCA3242E453B1D26070B678C94B7831?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=condemned&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=week&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=150&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH100623926J47D5M4L| publisher=News Store| accessdate=2011-09-13}}</ref>

In 2007, Central High School held an event for the 50th Anniversary of the Little Rock Nine entering Central. On September 24, 2007, a new museum was opened honoring the Little Rock Nine.

Little Rock Central High School made legal history again in 1968, this time in the field of [[Creation and evolution in public education|the teaching of evolution in the public schools]]. LRCHS biology teacher Susan Epperson agreed to be the plaintiff in a case challenging an Arkansas law forbidding the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] in the public schools. The United States Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' held that states could not require that "teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma," i.e. that the teaching of evolution in schools could not be forbidden on religious grounds.<ref>{{Cite web

==Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site==
[[Image:Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site Visitor Center.jpg|thumb|right|Visitor Center]]
On November 6, 1998, [[United States Congress|Congress]] established '''Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site'''. The [[National historic park|National Historic Site]] is administered in partnership with the [[National Park Service]], Little Rock Public Schools, the City of Little Rock, and others.<ref>[[National Geographic]] September 2000 (Vol 198 No 3) ''Hallowed Site, Working School'' Geographica Section-sub-section U.S. History</ref>

The Visitor Center for the site is located diagonally across the street from the school and across from the memorial dedicated by Michael Warrick, and opened in Fall 2006.  It contains a captioned interpretive film on the [[Little Rock Integration Crisis]], as well as multimedia exhibits on both that and the larger context of desegregation during the 20th century and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]].

Opposite the Visitor Center is the Central High Commemorative Garden, which features nine trees and benches that honor the students.  Arches that represent the school's facade contain embedded photographs of the school in years since the crisis, and showcase students of various backgrounds in activities together.

Opposite the Visitor Center in the other direction is a historic [[Mobil]] [[gas station]], which has been preserved in its appearance at the time of the crisis.  At the time, it served as the area for the press and radio and television reporters.  It later served as a temporary Visitor Center before the new one was built.
