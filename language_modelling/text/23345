'''Charles "Lefty" Driesell''' (born [[December 25]], [[1931]]) is a retired college [[basketball]] coach.  Driesell grew up in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where he attended Granby High School. The famous left-hander attended [[Duke University]] from [[1950]] to [[1954]], playing basketball under coach [[Harold Bradley]].

He began his coaching career as a junior varsity coach at Granby High School in Norfolk in 1954, and then took over as varsity coach the next year.  In 1957 he took a head coaching job at [[Newport News High School]], where his teams built a 57-game winning streak. 

Driesell's first college head-coaching job was with [[Davidson College]] from [[1960]] to [[1969]].  During his tenure there, he won the Southern Conference championship three times.  In 1969, he was hired by the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]].  It was during his introductory press conference that he made the bold statement that he wanted to make Maryland the "[[UCLA]] of the East."  [[UCLA]] was the dominant college basketball program at the time.

Driesell coached the University of Maryland Terrapins from [[1969]] to [[1986]].  During his tenure, the basketball team had such star players as [[Tom McMillen]], [[Len Elmore]], [[John Harding Lucas II|John Lucas]], [[Albert King]], [[Buck Williams]], and [[Len Bias]].  In [[1974]] he signed high school star [[Moses Malone]], but lost him to professional basketball, the [[Utah Stars]], just before classes began.  Moses was one of the first basketball players to jump directly from high school into the professional leagues.

Coach Driesell is also credited with starting the nationwide tradition of Midnight Madness in [[1971]], which began with the idea of getting the school excited for the team and the upcoming basketball season, and resulted in an event that involved having the team being introduced and practicing at midnight of the first day the team is allowed to begin practice during the school year.  In [[1972]], his team won the [[National Invitation Tournament]], and in [[1984]] he led the team to their first [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Tournament Championship.  Unfortunately, his coaching career at Maryland ended on a sour note when he was forced to resign after the drug-related death of one of his players, [[Len Bias]], as well as amid charges of academic problems and drug use among the athletes, and allegations that he hindered police inquiry into Bias' death.

He then went on to coach the [[James Madison University|James Madison]] Dukes until [[1996]], and the [[Georgia State University|Georgia State]] Panthers, where he retired on [[January 3]], [[2003]] in the middle of his 41st season of coaching.  His final coaching record in the NCAA was 786-394.

His son, Chuck, was hired in 2006 as an assistant coach by the University of Maryland. Driesell currently resides in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]].

On April 2, 2007, Driesell was named to the second class of the [[National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame]].  The other new members include [[Phog Allen]] of [[Kansas University]], [[Adolph Rupp]] of the [[University of Kentucky]], [[Henry Iba]] of [[Oklahoma State University]], [[John McLendon]] of [[Tennessee State]], [[Guy Lewis]] of the [[University of Houston]] and [[Norm Stewart]] of the [[University of Missouri]]. The committee also added former [[Duke]] coach [[Vic Bubas]] for his contributions to the game.

Players to be inducted include [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Austin Carr]], [[Dick Groat]] and [[Dick Barnett]].

Driesell now awaits entrance into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], along with current Maryland coach [[Gary Williams]].
