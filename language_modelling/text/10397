The '''2010 Guatemala City sinkhole''' was a disaster in which an area approximately {{convert|65|ft|m|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=5}} deep collapsed in [[Guatemala City]]'s Zona 2, claiming 15 lives, and swallowing a three-story factory.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor"/><ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/01/killer-sinkholes-deaths_n_2791634.html | title=Killer Sinkholes: Unexpected Holes Swallow Entire Families, Cars And Homes (PHOTOS) | work=Huffington Post | date=03/05/2013 | agency=Huffington Post | accessdate=2013-04-21 | author=Campbell, Andy}}</ref><ref name="National Geographic 1" /><ref name="National Geographic 2" /> The [[sinkhole]] occured for a combination of reasons, including [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]], the [[Pacaya#May 2010 eruption|Pacaya Volcano eruption]], and leakage from sewer pipes. 

==Background==

Overall, the risk of sinkholes occurring in Guatemala City is high, but unpredictable.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/photogalleries/100604-sinkhole-pictures-around-the-world-guatemala-city/ | title=Guatemala Sinkhole, 2010 | date=June 4, 2010 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=Minard, Anne}}</ref> [[2007 Guatemala City sinkhole|One recent, similar sinkhole]] had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 meters deep.<ref name="Waltham2008">Waltham, T., 2008, [http://qjegh.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/41/3/291 ''Sinkhole hazard case histories in karst terrains.''] Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology. vol. 41 no. 3, pp.. 291-300.</ref><ref name="Halliday2007">Halliday, W.

==Formation==
===Sewage pipes===
[[File:Tropical Storm Agatha Guatemala Flooding.jpg|thumb|left|Flooding triggered by Agatha in Guatemala]]
The sinkhole formed due to volcanic [[pumice]] deposits, which Guatemala City is built upon.<ref name="National Geographic 1" /> These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density, allowing easy [[erosion]].<ref name="National Geographic 1" /> According to Sam Bonis, a geologist at [[Dartmouth College]], leaking pipes went unfixed long enough to create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes.<ref name="National Geographic 1" /> Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer: sinkholes have natural causes, but this one was mainly artificial.<ref name="National Geographic 1" /> In addition, according to Bonis, sinkholes are usually formed from [[limestone]] but there is no limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City.<ref name="National Geographic 1" /> Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature.<ref name="National Geographic 1" />

===Tropical Storm Agatha===

Tropical Storm Agatha was first identified as a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] of [[Low pressure area|low pressure]] of the western coast of [[Costa Rica]] on May&nbsp;24, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Sandoval|date=May 24, 2010|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|accessdate=May 31, 2010|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDEP/TWDEP.201005241516.txt}}</ref> On May 29, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Agatha.<ref name="PA2">{{cite web|author=Stacey Stewart and Todd Kimberlain|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=May 31, 2010|title=Tropical Storm Agatha Public Advisory Two|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/ep01/ep012010.public.002.shtml?}}</ref> Later that day, the system intensified slightly before making [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near the [[Mexico]]-[[Guatemala]] border with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (75&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Lixion A.

===Pacaya volcano eruption===

{{Main|Pacaya#May 2010 eruption}}
On May&nbsp;27, two days before Agatha became a tropical depression, the [[Pacaya]] volcano, located about {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of [[Guatemala City]], erupted, killing at least one person and blanketing nearby areas with layers of ash.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/28/guatemala-volcano-pacaya-_n_593583.html#s94957title=Guatemala_Volcano | title=Guatemala Volcano: Pacaya Eruption Kills TV Reporter, 3 Missing (PHOTOS) | publisher=Huffington Post | date=05/28/10 | accessdate=3 July 2013 | author=Llorica, Juan}}</ref> The eruption prompted officials to shut down the country's international airport.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/07/22/guatemala.volcano/index.html | title=Guatemala warns of volcano danger | publisher=CNN | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> Upon the formation of Agatha, people feared that excessive rainfall from the storm could exaggerate the situation and trigger [[lahars]].<ref>{{cite web|author= Robert Campbell|publisher=Reuters|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2010|title=Guatemala girds for first Pacific storm of season|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5q5iMGCC3}}</ref> This had the effect of clogging the underground pipes with [[volcanic ash|soot]], increasing the chances of pipe rupture.<ref name="National Geographic 1" /><ref name="National Geographic 2" />

==Collapse and aftermath==
Mariela Casta<U+00F1><U+00F3>n, a reporter for the daily newspaper ''La Hora'', reported that the ground collapsed suddenly, taking a three-story house that was used as a factory and a security guard with it. Electricity poles were also sucked in. Authorities said they could not confirm the security guard's death.<ref name="Christian Science Monitor">{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0601/Guatemala-City-sinkhole-so-big-so-round-it-doesn-t-seem-real | title=Guatemala City sinkhole so big, so round it 'doesn't seem real' | work=Christian Science Monitor | date=June 1, 2010 | agency=Christian Science Monitor | accessdate=2013-04-21 | last=Fieser |first=Ezra | location=Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic}}</ref><ref name="La Hora">{{cite news | url=http://www.lahora.com.gt/index.php/nacional/guatemala/reportajes-y-entrevistas/131879-hundimientos-atraen-a-la-prensa-extranjera | title=Hundimientos atraen a la prensa extranjera | date=17 July 2010 | newspaper=La Hora | accessdate=2013-04-21 | last=Casta<U+00F1><U+00F3>n |first=Mariela}}</ref>

The sinkhole's collapse in Guatemala City's Zona 2 left at least 15 dead, and a further 300 residents' lives were put at risk.<ref name="Huffington Post" /> Because of the role played by sewage pipes in the sinkhole's collapse, Sam Bonis, along with other geologists, has demanded that the [[Government of Guatemala|government]] inspect the sewer system more regularly.<ref name="National Geographic 2" />

According to officials, the sinkhole had similarities with another Guatemalan sinkhole which collapsed in 2007, which may also have been formed by ruptured sewage pipes.<ref name="National Geographic 2">{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100601-sinkhole-in-guatemala-2010-world-science/# | title=Sinkhole in Guatemala: Giant Could Get Even Bigger | work=National Geographic | date=June 1, 2010 | agency=National Geographic | accessdate=2013-04-21 | author=Than, Ker}}</ref>

On a wider scale, immediately following reports of fatalities due to Agatha, a state of emergency was declared for Guatemala.<ref>{{cite web|author=Herbert Hernandez|work=Reuters|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 29, 2010|accessdate=May 31, 2010|title=Pacific storm Agatha's rains kill four in Guatemala|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5q5uuELn1}}</ref> On May&nbsp;31, national aid started to be deployed by the government and donation centers for victims of the storm were opened across the country.
