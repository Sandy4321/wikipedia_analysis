In [[category theory]], a category is '''cartesian closed''' if, roughly speaking, any [[morphism]] defined on a product of two objects can be naturally identified with a morphism defined on one of the factors. These categories are particularly important in [[mathematical logic]] and the theory of [[programming]]. For generalizations of this notion to [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]], see [[closed monoidal category]].

== Definition ==
The category ''C'' is called '''cartesian closed''' [[iff]] it satisfies the following three properties:
* it has a [[terminal object]]
* any two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''C'' have a [[product (category theory)|product]] ''X''<U+00D7>''Y'' in ''C''
* any two objects ''Y'' and ''Z'' of ''C'' have an [[exponential object|exponential]] ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> in ''C''

For the first two conditions above, it is the same to require that any finite (possibly empty) family of objects of ''C'' admit a [[product (category theory)|product]] in ''C'', because of the natural associativity of the categorical product and noticing that the empty product in a category is nothing but the [[terminal object]] of that category.

For the third condition it is equivalent to ask that the [[functor]] <U+2013><U+00D7>''Y'' (i.e. the functor from ''C'' to ''C'' that maps objects ''X'' to ''X''<U+00D7>''Y'' and morphisms <U+03C6> to <U+03C6><U+00D7>id<sub>''Y''</sub>) has a [[right adjoint]], usually denoted <U+2013><sup>''Y''</sup>, for all objects ''Y'' in ''C''. This in turn, is expressed by the existence of a [[bijection]] between the [[hom-set]]s
:<math>\mathrm{Hom}(X\times Y,Z) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(X,Z^Y)</math>
which is [[natural transformation|natural]] in both ''X'' and ''Z''.

== Examples ==
Examples of cartesian closed categories include:
* The category '''Set''' of all [[set]]s, with [[function (mathematics)|function]]s as morphisms, is cartesian closed. The product ''X''<U+00D7>''Y'' is the cartesian product of ''X'' and ''Y'', and ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> is the set of all functions from ''Y'' to ''Z''. The adjointness is expressed by the following fact: the function ''f'' : ''X''<U+00D7>''Y'' <U+2192> ''Z'' is naturally identified with the [[currying|curried]] function ''g'' : ''X'' <U+2192> ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> defined by ''g''(''x'')(''y'') = ''f''(''x'',''y'') for all ''x'' in ''X'' and ''y'' in ''Y''.
* The category of [[finite set|finite]] sets, with functions as morphisms, is cartesian closed for the same reason.
* If ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], then the category of all [[group action|''G''-sets]] is cartesian closed. If ''Y'' and ''Z'' are two ''G''-sets, then ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup> is the set of all functions from ''Y'' to ''Z'' with ''G'' action defined by (''g''.''F'')(''y'') = ''g''.(F(''g''<sup>''-1''</sup>.y)) for all ''g'' in ''G'', ''F'':''Y'' <U+2192> ''Z'' and ''y'' in ''Y''. 
* The category of finite ''G''-sets is also cartesian closed.
* The category '''Cat''' of all small categories (with functors as morphisms) is cartesian closed; the exponential ''C''<sup>''D''</sup> is given by the [[functor category]] consisting of all functors from ''D'' to ''C'', with [[natural transformation]]s as morphisms.
* If ''C'' is a [[small category]], then the [[functor category]] '''Set'''<sup>''C''</sup> consisting of all covariant functors from ''C'' into the category of sets, with [[natural transformation]]s as morphisms, is cartesian closed. If ''F'' and ''G'' are two functors from ''C'' to '''Set''', then the exponential ''F''<sup>''G''</sup> is the functor whose value on the object ''X'' of ''C'' is given by the set of all natural transformations from (''X'',<U+2212>)&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;''G'' to ''F''.
** The earlier example of ''G''-sets can be seen as a special case of functor categories: every group can be considered as a one-object category, and ''G''-sets are nothing but functors from this category to '''Set'''
** The category of all [[graph theory|directed graphs]] is cartesian closed; this is a functor category as explained under [[functor category]].
* In [[algebraic topology]], cartesian closed categories are particularly easy to work with, and it is regrettable that neither the category of [[topological space]]s with [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] maps nor the category of [[manifold|smooth manifolds]] with smooth maps is cartesian closed. Substitute categories have therefore been considered: the category of [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[Hausdorff space]]s is cartesian closed, as is the category of [[Fr<U+00F6>licher space]]s.
* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the [[open set]]s in ''X'' form the objects of a category O(''X'') for which there's a unique morphism from ''U'' to ''V'' if ''U'' is a subset of ''V'' and no morphism otherwise. This category is cartesian closed; the "product" of ''U'' and ''V'' is the intersection of ''U'' and ''V'' and the exponential ''U''<sup>''V''</sup> is the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of ''U''<U+222A>(''X''\''V'').

The following categories are ''not'' cartesian closed:
* The category of all [[vector space]]s over some fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] is not cartesian closed; neither is the category of all [[dimension of a vector space|finite-dimensional]] vector spaces.  While they have products (called direct sums), the product functors don't have right adjoints.  (They are, however, symmetric monoidal closed categories: the set of linear transformations between two vector spaces forms another vector space, so they're closed, and if one replaces the product by the tensor product, a similar isomorphism exists between the Hom spaces.)

* The category of [[abelian group]]s is not cartesian closed, for the same reason.

== Applications ==
In cartesian closed categories, a "function of two variables" (a morphism ''f'':''X''<U+00D7>''Y'' <U+2192> ''Z'') can always be represented as a "function of one variable" (the morphism <U+03BB>''f'':''X'' <U+2192> ''Z''<sup>''Y''</sup>). In [[computer science]] applications, this is known as [[currying]]; it has led to the realization that simply-typed [[lambda calculus]] can be interpreted in any cartesian closed category.

Certain cartesian closed categories, the [[topos|topoi]], have been proposed as a general setting for mathematics, instead of traditional [[set theory]].

The renowned computer scientist [[John Backus]] has advocated a variable-free notation, or [[Function-level programming]], which in retrospect bears some similarity to the internal language of cartesian closed categories. [[Categorical Abstract Machine Language|CAML]] is more consciously modelled on cartesian closed categories.

== Equational theory ==
In every cartesian closed category (using exponential notation), (''X''<sup>''Y''</sup>)<sup>''Z''</sup> and (''X''<sup>''Z''</sup>)<sup>''Y''</sup> are isomorphic for all objects ''X'', ''Y'' and ''Z''. We write this as the "equation"

:(''x''<sup>''y''</sup>)<sup>''z''</sup> = (''x''<sup>''z''</sup>)<sup>''y''</sup>

What other such equations are valid in all cartesian closed categories? It turns out that all of them follow logically from the following axioms:
*''x''<U+00D7>(''y''<U+00D7>''z'') = (''x''<U+00D7>''y'')<U+00D7>''z''
*''x''<U+00D7>''y'' = ''y''<U+00D7>''x''
*''x''<U+00D7>1 = ''x'' (here 1 denotes the terminal object of ''C'')
*1<sup>''x''</sup> = 1
*''x''<sup>1</sup> = ''x''
*(''x''<U+00D7>''y'')<sup>''z''</sup> = ''x''<sup>''z''</sup><U+00D7>''y''<sup>''z''</sup>
*(''x''<sup>''y''</sup>)<sup>''z''</sup> = ''x''<sup>(''y''<U+00D7>''z'')</sup>
