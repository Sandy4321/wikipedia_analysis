{{History of Hungary}}
The '''Hungarian Revolution or Uprising <ref> Alternate references are "Hungarian Revolt" and "Hungarian Uprising". In Hungarian, first the neutral term "felkel<U+00E9>s" (uprising) was used, then in the 1957-1988 period, the  negative term "ellenforradalom" (counter-revolution) was mandated by the government, while the new official name after 1990 has become the positive "forradalom <U+00E9>s szabads<U+00E1>gharc" (revolution and freedom fight) to imitate the old expression for the 1848-1849 revolution. Another explanation of the terms is that "Revolution"  conforms to both English [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/26566.htm (see U.S. Department of State background on Hungary)] and Hungarian ("forradalom") conventions. There is a distinction between the "complete overthrow" of a revolution and an uprising or revolt that may or may not be successful ([[Oxford English Dictionary]]). The 1956 Hungarian event, although short-lived, is a true "revolution" in that the sitting Government was indeed deposed. Unlike "coup d'<U+00E9>tat" or "putsch" which imply action of a few, the 1956 revolution was effected by the masses.</ref> of 1956''' ({{lang-hu|1956-os forradalom or felkel<U+00E9>s}}) was a spontaneous nationwide [[revolt]] against the government of the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-imposed policies, lasting from 23 October until 10 November 1956.

The revolt began as a student demonstration which attracted thousands as it marched through central [[Budapest]] to the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament building]]. A student delegation entering the [[Hungarian Radio|radio building]] in an attempt to broadcast [[Demands of Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1956|its demands]] was detained. When the delegation's release was demanded by the demonstrators outside, they were fired upon by the [[State Protection Authority|State Security Police]] (<U+00C1>VH) from within the building. The news spread quickly and disorder and violence erupted throughout the capital.

The revolt spread quickly across [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], and the government fell. Thousands organized into militias, battling the State Security Police (<U+00C1>VH) and [[Soviet Army|Soviet troops]]. Pro-Soviet communists and <U+00C1>VH members were often executed or imprisoned, as former prisoners were released and armed. Impromptu [[Workers' council|councils]] wrested municipal control from the ruling [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] and demanded political changes. The new government formally disbanded the <U+00C1>VH, declared its intention to withdraw from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and pledged to re-establish free elections. By the end of October, fighting had almost stopped and a sense of normality began to return.

After announcing a willingness to negotiate a withdrawal of Soviet forces, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] changed its mind and moved to crush the revolution. On 4 November, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. Hungarian resistance continued until 10 November. Over 2,500 Hungarians and 700 Soviet troops were killed in the conflict, and 200,000 Hungarians fled as refugees. Mass arrests and denunciations continued for months thereafter. By January 1957, the new Soviet-installed government had suppressed all public opposition. These Soviet actions alienated many Western [[Marxism|Marxists]], yet strengthened Soviet control over Central Europe. <!-- 5 Nov 09 - moved the following text into "comment" pending corresponding referenced text in the article, as per [[WP:LEADCITE]]: "...reinforcing perceptions that communism was both irreversible and monolithic."-->

Public discussion about this revolution was suppressed in Hungary for over 30 years, but since the thaw of the 1980s it has been a subject of intense study and debate. At the inauguration of the [[Third Hungarian Republic]] in 1989, October 23 was declared a national holiday.

==Prelude==
During World War II, Hungary was a member of the [[Axis powers]], thereby being allied with the fascist forces of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].  As a part of this, in 1941, the Hungarian military [[Hungary during World War II|participated]] in the [[invasion of Yugoslavia|occupation of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], joining the Axis powers.  The Soviet army was however able to force back the Hungarian and other Axis invaders, and by 1944, Soviet armies themselves were advancing towards Hungary.  Fearing invasion, the Hungarian government began armistice negotiations with the Allies, but these were ended when [[Operation Margarethe|Nazi Germany invaded and occupied]] the country and set up their own pro-Axis regime.  Both Hungarian and German forces stationed in Hungary were subsequently defeated when the Soviet Union invaded the country in 1945.

===Postwar occupation===
After World War II, the [[Soviet Army]] occupied Hungary, with the country coming under the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. At the time, Hungary was a [[multiparty democracy]], and [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|elections in 1945]] produced a [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|coalition government]] under Prime Minister [[Zolt<U+00E1>n Tildy]].  However, the [[Hungarian Communist Party]], a [[Leninist|Marxist-Leninist]] group who shared the Soviet government's ideological beliefs, constantly wrested small concessions in a process named "[[salami tactics]]", which sliced away the elected government's influence, despite the fact that had only received 17% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Kertesz | first=Stephen D. | title=Diplomacy in a Whirlpool: Hungary between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, [http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/dipl/dipl08.htm Chapter VIII (Hungary, a Republic), p.139-52] | publisher=[[University of Notre Dame Press]], Notre Dame, Indiana | year=1953 | isbn=0-8371-7540-2}} Retrieved 2006-10-8</ref><ref name="UNPara47">UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{PDF|[http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter II.

Being [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]], the Hungarian Communist Party set about to replace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy with a [[socialism|socialist]] one, and as a part of this undertook radical [[nationalization]] based on the Soviet model.

===Political repression and economic decline===
Hungary became a [[People's Republic of Hungary|communist state]] under the severely authoritarian leadership of [[M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi]].<ref>'''Video''': Hungary in Flames [http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/selection/rip/4/av/1956-43.html CEU.hu] producer: CBS (1958) - Fonds 306, Audiovisual Materials Relating to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, OSA Archivum, Budapest, Hungary ID number: HU OSA 306-0-1:40</ref> The Security Police (<U+00C1>VH) began a series of purges of more than 7000 dissidents, who were denounced as "[[Titoism|Titoists]]" or "western agents", and forced to confess in [[show trials]], after which they were relocated to a camp in eastern Hungary.<ref name="Tokes317">T<U+0151>k<U+00E9>s, Rudolf L.

From 1950 to 1952, the Security Police forcibly relocated thousands of people to obtain property and housing for the Working People's Party members, and to remove the threat of the intellectual and 'bourgeois' class. Thousands were arrested, tortured, tried, and imprisoned in [[concentration camps]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to the east]], or were executed, including <U+00C1>VH founder L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Rajk.<ref name="Tokes317"/><ref name=lawsoc>{{Cite book| last=Gati | first=Charles | title=Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher=Stanford University Press | year=2006 | month=September | isbn=0-8047-5606-6 }} (page 49). Gati describes "the most gruesome forms of psychological and physical torture...The reign of terror (by the R<U+00E1>kosi government) turned out to be harsher and more extensive than it was in any of the other Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe." He further references a report prepared after the collapse of communism, the Fact Finding Commission ''Torvenytelen szocializmus'' (Lawless Socialism): "Between 1950 and early 1953, the courts dealt with 650,000 cases (of political crimes), of whom 387,000 or 4 percent of the population were found guilty. (Budapest, Zrinyi Kiado/Uj Magyarorszag, 1991, 154).</ref> In a single year, more than 26,000 people were forcibly relocated from Budapest. As a consequence, jobs and housing were very difficult to obtain. The deportees generally experienced terrible living conditions and were impressed as slave labor on collective farms. Many died as a result of the poor living conditions and malnutrition.<ref name=wilson />

The R<U+00E1>kosi government thoroughly politicized Hungary's educational system to supplant the educated classes with a "toiling intelligentsia".<!--In February 1950, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party defined the supplantation of bourgeois leaders as its main goal. J<U+00F3>zsef Darvas, the Minister of Education and Religion from February 1950, wrote about secondary educational reforms in the pedagogical magazine ''K<U+00F6>znevel<U+00E9>s'' (17 September 1950): "The conversion of different grammar schools to industrial technical institutes, agricultural technical institutes, economical vocational high schools and training-colleges for school teachers and kindergarten instructors tends to the success of the [[planned economy|five year plan]] by supplying many of the needed technicians." On 30 October 1950, new guidelines were set for the colleges and universities: Marxism-Leninism should be the main subject in all classes, and studying the [[Russian language]] became mandatory. By the end of 1951, 107 new course books were issued, 61 of which were translations of texts used in Soviet universities. The number of students had to be increased by an additional 30,000 over the next five years.--><ref>{{cite journal | last=[http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/intezet/segtud/kardos.html Kardos, J<U+00F3>zsef] | authorlink=| title=Monograph {{hu icon}} | journal=Iskolakult<U+00FA>ra | volume=6<U+2013>7 | issue=June<U+2013>July 2003 | pages=73<U+2013>80 | publisher=[[University of P<U+00E9>cs]] | year=2003 | url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00011/00072/pdf/tan-konf-vita2003-6-7.pdf | accessdate=2006-10-09 }}</ref> Russian language study and Communist political instruction were made mandatory in schools and universities nationwide.

On 5 March 1953, [[Joseph Stalin]] died, ushering in a period of [[destalinization|moderate liberalization]] during which most European communist parties developed a reform wing.

Within the [[Cold War]] context of the time, by 1956 a fundamental tension had appeared in U.S. policy towards Hungary and the [[Eastern Bloc]] generally. The United States both hoped to encourage East European countries to break away from the bloc through their own efforts, but also wished to avoid a U.S.-Soviet military confrontation, fearing escalation into nuclear war. For these reasons, U.S. policy makers had to consider other means of diminishing Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, short of a [[rollback]] policy. This led to the development of [[containment]] policies such as economic and psychological warfare, covert operations, and, at a later stage, negotiation with the Soviet Union regarding the status of the East-bloc states. In the summer of 1956, relations between Hungary and the U.S. began to improve. At that time, the U.S. responded very favorably to Hungary's overtures about a possible expansion of bilateral trade relations. Hungary's desire for better relations was partly attributable to the country's catastrophic economic situation. Before any results could be achieved, however, the pace of negotiations was slowed by the Hungarian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which feared that better relations with the West might weaken Communist rule in Hungary.<ref name="BorhiContRoll"/>

===Social unrest builds===
R<U+00E1>kosi's resignation in July 1956 emboldened students, writers and journalists to be more active and critical in politics. Students and journalists started a series of intellectual forums examining the problems facing Hungary. These forums, called [[S<U+00E1>ndor Pet<U+0151>fi|Pet<U+0151>fi]] circles, became very popular and attracted thousands of participants.<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{PDF|[http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter IX.

On 16 October 1956, university students in [[Szeged]] snubbed the official communist student union, the DISZ, by re-establishing the MEFESZ (Union of Hungarian University and Academy Students), a democratic student organization, previously banned under the R<U+00E1>kosi dictatorship.<ref name="Crampton295"/> Within days, the student bodies of [[P<U+00E9>cs]], [[Miskolc]], and [[Sopron]] followed suit.

====The New Hungarian National Government====
The rapid spread of the uprising in the streets of Budapest and the abrupt fall of the Ger<U+0151>-Heged<U+00FC>s government left the new national leadership surprised, and at first disorganized. Nagy, a loyal Party reformer described as possessing "only modest political skills",<ref>{{Cite book| last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 2006 | month = September | isbn = 0-8047-5606-6 |page=52}}</ref> initially appealed to the public for calm and a return to the old order. Yet Nagy, the only remaining Hungarian leader with credibility in both the eyes of the public and the Soviets, "at long last concluded that a popular uprising rather than a counter-revolution was taking place".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Gati | first = Charles | title = Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt | publisher = Stanford University Press | year = 2006 | month = September | isbn = 0-8047-5606-6 |page=173}}</ref> Calling the ongoing insurgency "a broad democratic mass movement" in a radio address on 27 October, Nagy formed a government which included some non-communist ministers.

====Soviet perspective====
On 24 October, the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (the Politburo) discussed the political upheavals [[Polish October|in Poland]] and Hungary. A hard-line faction led by [[Vyacheslav Molotov|Molotov]] was pushing for intervention, but Khrushchev and Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]] were initially opposed. A delegation in Budapest reported that the situation was not as dire as had been portrayed. Khrushchev stated that he believed that Party Secretary Ern<U+0151> Ger<U+0151>'s request for intervention on 23 October indicated that the Hungarian Party still held the confidence of the Hungarian public. In addition, he saw the protests not as an ideological struggle, but as popular discontent over unresolved basic economic and social issues.<ref name = satellite/>

On 31 October the Soviet leaders decided to reverse their decision from the previous day. There is disagreement among historians whether Hungary's declaration to exit the Warsaw Pact caused the second Soviet intervention. Minutes of the 31 October meeting of the Presidium record that the decision to intervene militarily was taken one day before Hungary declared its neutrality and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact.<ref name = presidium>{{Cite web| title = Working Notes and Attached Extract from the Minutes of the CPSU CC Presidium Meeting, October&nbsp;31, 1956 | work = The 1956 Hungarian Revolution, A History in Documents | publisher = George Washington University: The National Security Archive | date = 2002-11-04 | url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc6.pdf | format = PDF |accessdate = 2006-07-08}}</ref> However, some Russian historians who are not advocates of the Communist era maintain that the Hungarian declaration of neutrality caused the Kremlin to intervene a second time.<ref>Sebestyen, Victor, ''Ungernrevolten 1956: Tolv dagar som skakade v<U+00E4>rlden'' (2006), p. 286.

Two days earlier, on 30 October, when Soviet Politburo representatives [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Mikhail Suslov]] were in Budapest, Nagy had hinted that neutrality was a long-term objective for Hungary, and that he was hoping to discuss this matter with the leaders in the Kremlin. This information was passed on to Moscow by Mikoyan and Suslov.<ref>Mark Kramer, [http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/ACF19B.pdf "New Evidence on Soviet Decision-making and the 1956 Polish and Hungarian Crises" (PDF)], Cold War International History Project Bulletin, page 369.</ref><ref>Sebestyen, Victor, ''Ungernrevolten 1956: Tolv dagar som skakade v<U+00E4>rlden'' (2006), p. 286.</ref> At that time, Khrushchev was in Stalin's [[dacha]], considering his options regarding Hungary.

Both movements challenged the pre-eminence of the Soviet Communist Party in Eastern Europe and perhaps Soviet [[hegemony]] itself. For the majority of the Presidium, the workers' direct control over their councils without Communist Party leadership was incompatible with their idea of socialism.

* The Presidium was concerned lest the West might perceive Soviet weakness if it did not deal firmly with Hungary. On 1956-10-29, Israeli, British and French forces [[Suez Crisis|invaded Egypt]]. Khrushchev reportedly remarked "We should reexamine our assessment and should not withdraw our troops from Hungary and Budapest. We should take the initiative in restoring order in Hungary.

* Khrushchev stated that many in the Communist Party would not understand a failure to respond with force in Hungary. [[De-Stalinization]] had alienated the more conservative elements of the Party, who were alarmed at threats to Soviet influence in Eastern Europe. On 17 June 1953, workers in [[East Berlin]] had staged an [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprising]], demanding the resignation of the government of the [[German Democratic Republic]].

According to some sources, the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] played an important role in Khrushchev's decision to suppress the Hungarian uprising.

On 1 November to 3 November, Khrushchev left Moscow to meet with his East-European allies and inform them of the decision to intervene. At the first such meeting, he met with [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gomu<U+0142>ka]] in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Then he had talks with the Romanian, Czechoslovak, and Bulgarian leaders in [[Bucharest]]. Finally Khrushchev flew with [[Malenkov]] to Yugoslavia, where they met with [[Josip Broz Tito]], who was vacationing on his island [[Brijuni|Brioni]] in the Adriatic.

The problem was not that Suez distracted U.S. attention from Hungary, but that it made the condemnation of Soviet actions very difficult. As Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] later explained: "We couldn't on one hand, complain about the Soviets intervening in Hungary and, on the other hand, approve of the British and the French picking that particular time to intervene against [Gamel Abdel] [[Nasser]]".<ref name="BorhiContRoll"/> Responding to the plea by Nagy at the time of the second massive Soviet intervention on 4 November, the Security Council resolution critical of Soviet actions was vetoed by the Soviet Union; instead [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 120|resolution 120 was adopted]] to pass the matter onto the General Assembly. The General Assembly, by a vote of 50 in favor, 8 against and 15 abstentions, called on the Soviet Union to end its Hungarian intervention, but the newly constituted K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r government rejected UN observers.<ref>Hungarian Revolt, 23 October<U+2013>4 November 1956 (Richard Lettis and William I.

The Hungarian Army put up sporadic and uncoordinated resistance. Although some very senior officers were openly pro-Soviet, the rank and file soldiers were overwhelmingly loyal to the revolution and either fought against the invasion or deserted. The United Nations reported that there were no recorded incidents of Hungarian Army units fighting on the side of the Soviets.<ref>UN General Assembly ''Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary'' (1957) {{PDF|[http://mek.oszk.hu/01200/01274/01274.pdf Chapter V.

===Soviet version of the events===
Soviet reports of the events surrounding, during, and after the disturbance were remarkably consistent in their accounts, more so after the Second Soviet intervention cemented support for the Soviet position amongst international Communist Parties. [[Pravda]] published an account 36 hours after the outbreak of violence, which set the tone for all further reports and subsequent Soviet historiography:<ref name=Barghoorn_SFP />
# On 23 October, the "honest" socialist Hungarians demonstrated against mistakes made by the [[M<U+00E1>ty<U+00E1>s R<U+00E1>kosi|R<U+00E1>kosi]] and [[Ern<U+0151> Ger<U+0151>|Ger<U+0151>]] governments.
# Fascist, Hitlerite, reactionary, counter-revolutionary hooligans financed by the imperialist west took advantage of the unrest to stage a counter-revolution.
# The honest Hungarian people under Nagy appealed to Soviet (Warsaw Pact) forces stationed in Hungary to assist in restoring order.
# The Nagy government was ineffective, allowing itself to be penetrated by counter-revolutionary influences, weakening then disintegrating, as proven by Nagy's culminating denouncement of the Warsaw Pact.
# Hungarian patriots under [[J<U+00E1>nos K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r|K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r]] broke with the Nagy government and formed a government of honest Hungarian revolutionary workers and peasants; this genuinely popular government petitioned the Soviet command to help put down the counter-revolution.
# Hungarian patriots, with Soviet assistance, smashed the counter-revolution.
The first Soviet report came out 24 hours after the first Western report. Nagy's appeal to the United Nations was not reported. After Nagy was arrested outside of the Yugoslav embassy, his arrest was not reported. Nor did accounts explain how Nagy went from patriot to traitor.<ref>Pravda (Moscow), 4 November [227/228]: "Without the Slightes Delays", Moscow<br />
Imre Nagy turned out to be, objectively speaking, an accomplice of the reactionary forces. Imre Nagy cannot and does not want to fight the dark forces of reaction...
The Soviet Government, seeing that the presence of Soviet troops in Budapest might lead to further aggravation of the situation, ordered troops to leave Budapest, but ensuing events have shown that reactionary forces, taking advantage of the non-intervention of the Nagy Cabinet, have gone still further...
The task of barring the way to reaction in Hungary has to be carried out without the slightest delay -such is the course dictated by events...<br />

In January 1957, representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania met in Budapest to review internal developments in Hungary since the establishment of the Soviet-imposed government. A communiqu<U+00E9> on the meeting "unanimously concluded" that Hungarian workers, with the leadership of the K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r government and support of the Soviet army, defeated attempts "to eliminate the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people".<ref name=communique>George Washington University: The National Security Archive, [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB76/doc11.pdf Communiqu<U+00E9> on the Meeting of Representatives of the Governments and the Communist and Workers<U+2019> Parties of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Soviet Union] (Budapest, January 6, 1957), Retrieved: 2008-12-7</ref>

These white books were widely distributed in several languages in most of the socialist countries and, while based in fact, present factual evidence with a colouring and narrative not generally supported by non-Soviet aligned historians.<ref>''The 1956 Hungarian Revolution: A History in Documents'' by Csaba B<U+00E9>k<U+00E9>s & Malcolm Byrne (Published by Central European University Press, 2002, isbn 9639241660, 9789639241664, 598 pages), p. 375, para 4: "...the (K<U+00E1>d<U+00E1>r) regime had to find an explanation for the revolution and collapse of the old regime in October 1956...they chose to interpret the uprising as a conspiracy by anti-communist, reactionary forces. This is why they labeled many ordinary citizens' actions as crimes. Critical opposition attitudes were described as "a plot to overthrow the people's democratic regime", and workers and peasants who took part in the revolt were called "jailbirds, ragamuffins, and kulaks." Armed resistance to occupying forces became "murder and wrecking state property." This kind of terminology became part of the official ideology of the regime toward the outside world." Also p. 375, footnote 40: "For a typical survey of propaganda intended for distribution abroad, see the so called "White Books" entitled ''The Counter-Revolutionary Forces in the October Events in Hungary'', 4 vols., (Budapest: Information Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, 1956&ndash;1957)...The White Books published in the individual counties of Hungary in 1957&ndash;1958 summarized local "counter-revolutionary" events."</ref>

In the immediate aftermath, many thousands of Hungarians were arrested. Eventually, 26,000 of these were brought before the Hungarian courts, 22,000 were sentenced, 13,000 imprisoned, and several hundred executed. Hundreds were also deported to the Soviet Union, many without evidence. Approximately 200,000 fled Hungary as refugees.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Report by Soviet Deputy Interior Minister M. N.

===International===
Despite Cold War rhetoric by the [[Free world|West]] espousing a rollback of the domination of Eastern Europe by the USSR, and Soviet promises of the imminent triumph of socialism, national leaders of this period as well as later historians saw the failure of the uprising in Hungary as evidence that the Cold War in Europe had become a stalemate.<ref>Johns Hopkins University Professor Charles Gati, in his book ''Failed Illusions: Moscow, Washington, Budapest, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolt'' (see Further reading, below), agreed with a 2002 essay by Hungarian historian Csaba Bekes "Could the Hungarian Revolution Have Been Victorious in 1956?". Gati states: "Washington implicitly acknowledging the division of the continent into two camps, understood that Moscow would not let go of a country bordering on neutral but pro-Western Austria and an independent Yugoslavia, so it shed... tears over Soviet brutality, and exploited the propaganda opportunities..." (p. 208)</ref> The Foreign Minister of West Germany recommended that the people of Eastern Europe be discouraged from "taking dramatic action which might have disastrous consequences for themselves."

The events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the Communist parties of Western Europe. Within the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI) a split ensued: most ordinary members and the Party leadership, including [[Palmiro Togliatti]] and [[Giorgio Napolitano]], regarded the Hungarian insurgents as counter-revolutionaries, as reported in ''[[l'Unit<U+00E0>]]'', the official PCI newspaper.<ref>The following are references in English on the conflicting positions of [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808752,00.html ''l'Unit<U+00E0>''], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808824,00.html Antonio Giolitti and party boss Palmiro Togliatti], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868066,00.html Giuseppe Di Vittorio] and [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-219206/socialism Pietro Nenni].</ref> However [[Giuseppe Di Vittorio]], chief of the Communist trade union [[CGIL]], repudiated the leadership position, as did the prominent party members [[Antonio Giolitti]], [[Loris Fortuna]] and many other influential Communist intellectuals, who later were expelled or left the party. [[Pietro Nenni]], the national secretary of the [[Italian Socialist Party]], a close ally of the PCI, opposed the Soviet intervention as well. Napolitano, elected in 2006 as [[President of the Italian Republic]], wrote in his 2005 political autobiography that he regretted his justification of Soviet action in Hungary, and that at the time he believed in Party unity and the international leadership of Soviet communism.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Napolitano | first = Giorgio | year = 2005 | title = Dal Pci al socialismo europeo.

Within the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), dissent that began with the repudiation of Stalin by [[John Saville]] and [[E.P. Thompson]], influential historians and members of the [[Communist Party Historians Group]], culminated in a loss of thousands of party members as events unfolded in Hungary. [[Peter Fryer]], correspondent for the CPGB newspaper ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|The Daily Worker]]'', reported accurately on the violent suppression of the uprising, but his dispatches were heavily censored;<ref name="Fryer"/> Fryer resigned from the paper upon his return, and was later expelled from the communist party. In France, moderate communists, such as historian [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], resigned, questioning the policy of supporting Soviet actions by the [[French Communist Party]]. The French philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] wrote an [[open letter]], ''[[The Blood of the Hungarians]]'', criticizing the West's lack of action. Even [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], still a determined communist, criticised the Soviets in his article ''Le Fant<U+00F4>me de Staline'', in ''Situations VII''.<ref>Sartre, Jean-Paul (1956), [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-21/2005-06-21-809020 L<U+2019>intellectuel et les communistes fran<U+00E7>ais {{fr icon}}] Le Web de l'Humanite, 21 June 2005.

==Historiography==
Gy<U+00F6>rgy Litv<U+00E1>n, a widely respected historian of 1956, has identified seven myths surrounding the 1956 revolution that reflect but are incapable of generally characterising the revolution.  Litv<U+00E1>n celebrates the growth of a new and scientific scholarship after 1989 by a younger generation of historians in Hungary and outside of Hungary; however, Litv<U+00E1>n notes that despite this academic endeavour, recurring popular and scholarly myths place undue emphasis on particular elements of the revolution.  One reason Litv<U+00E1>n identifies for the generation of myths, was the position that the 1956 revolution played in Western cold war politics; both for the Western establishment, and for far left workers and intellectuals.  Litv<U+00E1>n identifies these historiographical errors as undue emphases on: the central role of the workers councils; the importance of the writers; the central importance of young working class urban insurgents; that only Budapest was revolutionary; that the revolution was morally "pure"; that there was unprecedented national unity behind the revolution; and, the myth that 1956 was a [[counter-revolution]].<ref>Gy<U+00F6>rgy Litv<U+00E1>n (2006) "[http://www.historia.hu/archivum/2006/0610_08.htm M<U+00ED>toszok <U+00E9>s legend<U+00E1>k 1956-r<U+00F3>l]" [Myths and Legends 1956] ''Hist<U+00F3>ria'' (Hungary, ISSN:01392409) : <U+00B6><U+00B6>1<U+2013>22 in the online edition.</ref> Gy<U+00E1>ni describes the historiography of 1956 through a plurality of myths, related to the foundational documents of the Kadarist state removing the capacity for individual memory, and after 1989 to the use of law to restrict the collective right to memory in favour of individual rights to control the representation of individuals in the past.  These popular and institutional practices were reflected in both the reformist communist stance of historians following the [[Imre Nagy Institute]], and their post-1989 right wing historian opposition.<ref>G<U+00E1>bor Gy<U+00E1>ni, (2006) "Memory and Discourse on the 1956 Hungarian Revolution," ''Europe-Asia Studies'' 58:8: 1199<U+2013>1203, 1206<U+2013>1208 doi:10.1080/09668130600995731</ref>  Gy<U+00E1>ni and Litv<U+00E1>n indicate that the historiography of 1956 is a live political issue in Hungary, and so outside of the scholarly debate multiple conflicting remembrances of 1956 exist.
