==Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge==
{{main|Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge}}
[[Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge]] was the first National Wildlife Refuge west of the [[Mississippi River]].  The refuge has provided protection for [[Oregon]]'s largest [[seabird]] nesting colony of more 230,000 birds since [[October 14]][[1907]].<ref name="fws3"> {{cite web

Three Arch Rocks consists of 15 acres (6 ha) in three large and six small rocks located about a half mile (1 km) offshore from [[Oceanside, Oregon|Oceanside]]. It is the one of the smallest designated [[Wilderness Act|wilderness areas]] in the U.S., but features the largest colony of breeding [[Tufted Puffin]]s and the largest [[Common Murre]] colony south of Alaska.  It is the only northern Oregon pupping site for the threatened [[Steller Sea Lion]].<ref name="fws3"/>

=== History ===
The refuge was established by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] after being persuaded by two young conservationists<U+2014>[[William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge|William L. Finley]] and Herman Bohlman<U+2014>who studied and photographed Three Arch Rocks from Oceanside beginning in 1901.  They recorded hunters killing dozens of sea lions at a time for skin and oil, and sportsmen shooting seabirds purely for sport.  Due to a scarcity of regional chicken farms at the time, seabird eggs were priced at up to a dollar per dozen, encouraging egg harvesting and reducing the bird colony population.  Finley and Bohlman suggested a wildlife refuge to Roosevelt for protecting dwindling populations and ensure survival of seabird and marine mammal populations.  Roosevelt declared the refuge in 1907.

=== Access ===
The islands are closed to public access.  Boats must remain at least 500 ft (150 m) away during summer months,<ref> {{cite web

This [[Oregon]] refuge set on [[Cape Meares]] has provided protection since 1938 for [[Sitka Spruce]] and [[Western Hemlock]], some more than 200 feet (61 m) tall and hundreds of years old.  The conditions are ideal habitat for several threatened bird species, including [[Bald Eagle]]s and [[Peregrine Falcon]]s<U+2014>the latter once at the brink of extinction.  A pair of Peregrine Falcons has resided here since 1987.

The [[Oregon Coast Trail]] passes through the center of this [[Headlands and bays|headland]] refuge where interpretive displays describe its many inhabitants.  It is possible to see migrating [[Gray Whale]]s, three types of [[Scoter]], [[Western Grebe]], and [[Common Loon]]s.  A wildlife viewing deck provides a seasonal view into the [[aerie]] of a [[Falcon]] pair.

[[Three Arch Rocks National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Oregon Islands National Wildlife Refuge]] are easily seen from the cape.  Also, [[Cape Meares Light]], and an Oregon state park are adjacent.

==Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge==
{{main|Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge}}
Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge is renowned among [[bird watchers]] for being able to view rare [[shorebird]]s including [[Ruff (bird)|Ruff]], [[Hudsonian Godwit]], and [[Mongolian Plover]].<ref name="fwsbm"> {{cite web

Last expanded in 1999, it now has 889 acres in two units:  Bandon Marsh and Ni-les'tun.

Bandon Marsh is popular for hunting, fishing, clamming, birding and photography.
The refuge protects the largest tidal [[salt marsh]] in the [[Coquille River]] estuary.
The mudflats are rich in [[clam]], [[crab]], [[worm]], and [[shrimp]] and attracts migrating shorebirds, waterfowl, [[Coho Salmon]], as well as the endangered [[California Brown Pelican]].
More common shorebird species include Western and Least [[Sandpiper]], [[Semipalmated Plover]], [[Black-bellied Plover]], [[Pacific Golden Plover]], [[Red Phalarope]], [[Whimbrel]], [[Dunlin]].<ref name="fwsbm"/>

The Ni-les'tun unit is a habitat restoration project which will eventually benefit fish and wildlife.  In consists of intertidal and freshwater marsh, and [[riparian]] land.  It also protects a 4,500 year-old Native American archaeological site of the  [[Coquille Indian Tribe]].<ref name="fwsbm"/>

There are several overlooks, as well as access for hunters, birders, fisherman, and clammers.  State and federal regulations are in effect.

The Marsh is located just north of [[Bandon, Oregon|Bandon]], on the east side of the Coquille river across from [[Bullards Beach State Park]].

==Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge==
{{main|Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge}}
Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge supports one tenth of the world's [[Dusky Canada Goose]] population.  The refuge contains at least seven types of habitat, including tidal marsh, tidal mudflats, grassland, woodland, pasture, forested lagg<U+2014>a transition between raised [[peat bog]] and mineral soil<U+2014>and freshwater bogs, including the southernmost coastal [[Sphagnum]] bog habitat on the Pacific Coast.<ref name="fwsnb"> {{cite web

The Sphagnum bog provides habitat for many interesting and unusual species, such as the insect-eating [[Sundew]] plant and the bog [[cranberry]].  Scientists have discovered many layers of sand and peat under Neskowin Marsh indicating a long history of [[tsunami]] activity which carries sand from the coastal sand dunes.  These might be the best record of tsunami activity within the [[Cascadia subduction zone]].<ref name="brochure"> {{cite web

The refuge was established in 1991,<ref name="brochure"/> and is located on [[Nestucca Bay]] at the confluence of the [[Nestucca River|Nestucca]] and [[Little Nestucca River|Little Nestucca]] rivers, ranging 3 to 5 miles (5 to 8 km) south of [[Pacific City, Oregon|Pacific City]].  Across the bay to the west is [[Nestucca Spit State Park|Nestucca Spit]] and [[Robert W. Straub State Park|Robert W. Straub]] state parks.

The refuge is closed to all public use, except during two special events:  one in February and one in October.  A viewing area is planned for construction, probably in 2008.<ref> {{cite web

==Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge==
{{main|Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge}}
Siletz Bay National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1991 primarily to return salt marsh to its natural state.  Formerly it had been diked and crossed with ditches to create pasture for dairy cow grazing.  More than 9,300 ft (2.8 km) of dikes were removed and a quarter mile (500 m) of ditch were filled to initiate restoration.  Salt-starched skeleton trees are visible along both sides of [[U.S. Route 101]] (which runs through the refuge) from the time when the salt marsh was diked.  [[Red-tailed Hawk]]s and [[Bald Eagle]]s are often visible roosting on these snags.  Abundant [[Great Blue Heron]] and [[Great Egret]] live nearby.

The refuge is located on Siletz Bay, immediately south of [[Lincoln City, Oregon|Lincoln City]] where the [[Siletz River]] enters the bay.  It is closed to all public use, except during special events.
