'''Edward Grant Barrow''' (May 10, 1868&nbsp;<U+2013> December 15, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[baseball manager|manager]] and [[front office]] executive in [[Major League Baseball]]. He served as the field manager of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Boston Red Sox]]. He served as president of the [[New York Yankees]], and is credited with building the team's [[dynasty (sports)|dynasty]]. Barrow was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1953.

Born in a [[covered wagon]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]], Barrow worked as a [[journalist]] and soap salesman before entering the business of baseball by selling [[Concession stand|concessions]] at games. From there, Barrow purchased [[minor league baseball]] teams, also serving as team manager, and served as president of the [[Atlantic League (1896<U+2013>1900)|Atlantic League]]. After managing the Tigers in 1903 and 1904 and returning to the minor leagues, Barrow became disenchanted with baseball, and left the game to operate a hotel.

Barrow returned to baseball in 1910 as president of the [[International League|Eastern League]]. After a seven year tenure, Barrow managed the Red Sox from 1918 through 1920, leading the team to victory in the [[1918 World Series]]. When Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] began to sell his star players, Barrow joined the Yankees as their business manager, a role he served in from 1920 through 1945. During that time, the Yankees won 14 [[List of American League pennant winners|AL pennants]], and were [[World Series]] champions 10 times.

Barrow became manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in 1918.

Barrow installed himself in the Yankees' infrastructure between co-owner [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] and manager [[Miller Huggins]], as Huston frequently criticized Huggins.
