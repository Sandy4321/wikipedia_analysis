'''''Mortal Kombat''''' (commonly abbreviated "''MK''") is a series of [[fighting game]]s created by [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]]. The first four renditions and their updates were developed by [[Midway Games]] and initially released on arcade machines, and later to home consoles. The arcade titles were later picked up by [[Acclaim Entertainment]] for the [[video game console|home console]] conversions. Beginning with ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', Midway Games exclusively created home versions of ''Mortal Kombat'' up until ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. Following Midway's bankruptcy, the franchise was picked up by [[Warner Bros.]] in July 2009 and became a part of the [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]]. The most recent title is ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' which is an alternate retelling of the events from the first three games in the series.<ref name="latimesblogs.latimes.com" />

The development of the first game was originally based on the actor martial artist [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], but that idea fell through and ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' was born instead. As a result of its success, ''Mortal Kombat'' has spawned many sequels and has been spun off into several [[action-adventure game]]s, films ([[Mortal Kombat (film)#The Journey Begins|animated]] and [[Mortal Kombat (film)|live-action]] with its own [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation|sequel]]), and television series ([[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm|animated]] and [[Mortal Kombat: Konquest|live-action]]). Other spin-offs include various [[Mortal Kombat (comics)|comic book series]], a [[Mortal Kombat Kard Game|card game]] and a [[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour|live-action tour]].

The series is known for its high levels of bloody [[violence]], including, most notably, its [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]]<U+2014>finishing moves, requiring a sequence of buttons to perform, which, in part, led to the creation of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]].<ref name="GameMakers episode">{{cite web |title= GameMakers Mortal Kombat Episode #313 |url= http://g4tv.com/gamemakers/episodes/3446/Mortal-Kombat.html |publisher= [[G4TV]] |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat |url= http://www.forbes.com/2007/06/15/games-violence-columbine-tech-cx_ag_0618videogames_slide_4.html?thisSpeed=undefined |date=2007-06-15 |publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> The series name itself is also known for [[hard and soft C|using the letter "K" in place of "C"]] for the [[voiceless velar plosive|hard C]] sound, thus [[Sensational spelling|intentionally misspelling]] the word "combat," as well as other words with the hard C sound within later games in the series. Early games in the series were especially noted for its realistic [[digitization|digitized]] [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] (which differentiated it from its contemporaries' hand-drawn sprites), as well as an extensive use of [[palette swap]]ping to create new characters.

{{Further|Fighting game}}

The original three games and their updates, ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', were styled in a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] fighting fashion. The first two were played in the arcades with a [[joystick]] and five buttons: high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick, and block. ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and its updates added a sixth "run" button.<ref name=history/> Characters in the early ''Mortal Kombat'' games play virtually identical to one another, with the only major differences being their special moves.<ref>{{cite web |title=1UP Show: Mortal Kombat vs. DCU Impressions|url=http://gamevideos.1up.com/video/id/22707 |date= 2008-11-21 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> Through the 1990s, [[Midway Games]] would keep their single styled fighting moves with four attack buttons for a different array of punches and kicks and block. ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'' changed this by differentiating characters normal moves and even giving them multiple fighting styles. Beginning in ''Deadly Alliance'' and until ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', the characters would have three fighting styles per character: two unarmed styles, and one weapon style.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Dunham |title=Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance|date=2002-11-19 |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/377/377892p1.html |page=2,3 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> Few exceptions to this arose in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'', such as monster-like [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] characters like [[Moloch]] and [[Onaga]] who would have only one fighting style.<ref name="MKA IGN review">{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Haynes |date=2006-10-06|title=Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/738/738086p3.html |page=3 |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> While most of the styles used are based on real [[martial arts]], some are entirely fictitious.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Gerstmann|title=Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/mortalkombatdeadlyalliance/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews |date=2002-11-22 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2010-04-04}}</ref> [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro's]] fighting styles, for example, are designed to take advantage of the fact that he has four arms.

{{main|Fatality (Mortal Kombat)}}

A defining and best-known feature of the ''Mortal Kombat'' series is a finishing move called Fatality. An original idea behind the Fatalities was to give gamers a free hit at the end of the fight.<ref name="history"/> The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform one perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.<ref name=history/><ref name="MK3">{{cite web | author = Gertsmann, Jeff | url = http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/ultimatemortalkombat3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review | title = Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Review | publisher = GameSpot | date = October 24, 2008 | accessdate = January 11, 2009 }}</ref> 

Other finishing moves in the various ''Mortal Kombat'' games include Animality (introduced in ''Mortal Kombat 3'') turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent,<ref name="GameSpotMK3"/> Brutality (introduced in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'') which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long [[Combo (video gaming)|combo]] of hits, and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in ''Mortal Kombat II'') utilising parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move. ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' added the [[Seppuku|Hara-Kiri]], a self-Fatality to allow the losers to engage in a [[suicide]]-based finishing move, enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first.<ref name="history">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level="The History of Fatalities" commentary}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first= Greg |last= Kasavin |title=  Mortal Kombat: Deception (Xbox) Review |date= October 4, 2004 |url= http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/mortalkombatdeception/review.html |publisher= [[Gamespot]] |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref>

== Plot ==
The series takes place in a [[fictional universe]] consisting of six surviving realms which, according to in-game backstories, were created by the [[wikia:MortalKombat:Elder Gods|Elder Gods]]. The ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'' manual described the six realms as: "Earthrealm, home to such legendary heroes as Liu Kang, Kung Lao, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, and Jax, and also under the protection of the Thunder God Raiden; Netherrealm, the fiery depths of which are inhospitable to all but the most vile, a realm of demons and shadowy warriors; Outworld, a realm of constant strife which Emperor Shao Kahn claims as his own; Seido, The Realm of Order, whose inhabitants prize structure and order above all else; The Realm of Chaos, whose inhabitants do not abide by any rules whatsoever, and where constant turmoil and change are worshipped; and Edenia, which is known for its beauty, artistic expression, and the longevity of its inhabitants."<ref name="MKD booklet">{{Cite document |title=Mortal Kombat Deception Instruction Booklet |year= 2004 |publisher= Midway Amusement Game, LLC |page= 15 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name="mkdk">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2004-10-04 |level= Konquehh |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref>  The Elder Gods decreed that the denizens of one realm could only conquer another realm by defeating the defending realm's greatest warriors in ten consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments.

The [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|first ''Mortal Kombat'' game]] takes place in Earthrealm where seven different warriors with their own reasons for entering participated in the tournament with the eventual prize being the continued freedom of their realm, threatened with a takeover by Outworld. Among the established warriors were [[Liu Kang]], [[Johnny Cage]], and [[Sonya Blade]]. With the help of the Thunder God [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and [[Liu Kang]] became the new champion of Mortal Kombat.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat 2]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=1994 |level=Opening sequence}}</ref> In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', unable to deal with [[Shang Tsung]]'s failure, Outworld Emperor [[Shao Kahn]] lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where the Earthrealm warriors eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen [[Sindel]] in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by the Earthrealm warriors again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Princess Kitana]]. The following game, ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'', features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by the Earthrealm warriors.

In ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'', the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces to conquer the realms and subsequently become the antagonists. By ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile at the end of ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'',<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=November 20, 2002 |level=Reptile ending |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> had deceived [[List of characters in the Mortal Kombat series#Shujinko|Shujinko]], the protagonist of ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu,<ref name="mkdk"/> the source of Onaga's power. Onaga then confronted the alliance of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and Quan Chi and thus obtained Quan Chi's amulet,<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 4, 2004 |level=Opening Sequence}}</ref> the final piece of his power, becoming the antagonist. Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over the Dragon King and removed his threat to the Mortal Kombat universe.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=April 4, 2007 |level=Shujinko Bio}}</ref>

In ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' the catastrophe known as Armageddon starts. Centuries before the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Queen Delia foretold the realms would be destroyed in an event known as Armageddon. King Argus had his sons, Taven, the protagonist of the game, and Daegon, put into incubation who would one day be awakened to save the realms from Armageddon. In the end, however, because Blaze's design has been corrupted by Onaga's holy men, Taven's victory over Blaze does not destroy the combatants or strip them of their powers, instead increasing the powers of the fighters, potentially exacerbating the onset of Armageddon. As a result, Taven will make it his duty as a new god to delay Armageddon until a solution can be found.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=Konquest |accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref>

In [[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|''Mortal Kombat'']] (2011), it is revealed that the battle between the warriors of the six realms culminated into only two survivors: Shao Kahn and Raiden. Badly beaten, Raiden had only one last move he could make to prevent Shao Kahn from claiming the power of Blaze. He sends visions of the entire course of the ''Mortal Kombat'' timeline to himself in the past right before the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament (first game). This transfer of information to his former self causes a rift in time causing the ''Armageddon'' timeline to be erased and a new "reboot" timeline to be introduced, with a new outcome of Mortal Kombat history to be written. But this story leads to even worse unforeseen events. It ends with many of the main game characters dying at the hands of Queen Sindel and eventually Raiden accidentally kills Liu Kang in self-defense. But eventually the Elder Gods aid Raiden in killing Shao Kahn and saving Earthrealm. But as the scene goes on it is later revealed that this was all a plan by Lord Shinnok and Quan Chi.

==Development history==
===Origins===
''Mortal Kombat'' started development in 1991 with only four people: [[Ed Boon]], [[John Tobias]], John Vogel and Dan Forden.<ref name="mortalkombatint">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/news_060707_mortal.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071023152817/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/news_060707_mortal.html | archivedate=October 23, 2007 | title=Mortal Kombat: Ed Boon Interview | publisher=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> In 2009, Boon said: "The first Mortal Kombat game was 4 guys, literally, one programmer, myself (Boon), two graphics guys (Tobias and Vogel), and a sound guy (Forden) was the entire team, literally."<ref>{{cite web |first= Larry |last=Hryb |title= Show #305 : The Maw and Ed Boon |url= http://majornelson.com/index.php/2009/01/18/show-305-the-maw-and-ed-boone |date= January 18, 2009 |publisher= [http://majornelson.com/Default.aspx majornelson.com] |accessdate= October 22, 2009}}</ref> Originally, Boon and Tobias were approached to create a video game adaptation of the 1992 film ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]''<ref name=gp>''GamePro'' 58 (May 1994), page 28-31</ref> starring actor and martial artist [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], with a [[Digitizing|digitized]] version of the action star fighting villains.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|year=2008|publisher=Guinness World Records|location=London|isbn=978-1904994213}}</ref> Intending to make a game "a lot more hard edge, a little bit more serious, a little bit more like ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' or ''[[Bloodsport (film)|Bloodsport]]''" than ''[[Street Fighter II]]'',<ref>Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012</ref> Boon and Tobias decided to continue their project even after the deal to use the ''Bloodsport'' license fell through.<ref name="GameMakers episode"/> One of their own characters, [[Johnny Cage]], became "a [[parody|spoof]] on the whole Van Damme situation."<ref name=gp/>

Tobias said that his inspirations for the game's story and characters came from the [[Chinese mythology]] and some of the stories and rumored events about the [[Shaolin monks]].<ref name=gp/> Regarding the film ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', Tobias wrote that although this movie "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural [[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]] films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from [[Tsui Hark]] films -- ''[[Zu Warriors]]'' & ''[[The Swordsman]]''. We had to get them from bootleggers in [[Chinatown, Chicago|Chgo's Chinatown]]."<ref>[http://twitter.com/#!/therealsaibot John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter]</ref>

Ed Boon recalled that for six out of the eight months while they were in production of the original ''Mortal Kombat'', "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate." Some of the names suggested included "[[Kumite]]", "Dragon Attack", "Death Blow" and just "Fatality". Someone had written down "combat" on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, "just to be kind of weird." Steve Ritchie, a [[pinball]] designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word "Kombat" and said to Boon, <nowiki>'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?'</nowiki> and that name "just stuck."<ref>{{cite web |title= Episode 123 of KOXM |url= http://dl.oxmonline.com/oxmp_123_20080710.mp3 |date= 2008-07 |publisher= [[Official Xbox Magazine]] |accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> Sine then, the series uses the letter [[Hard and soft C|"K" in place of "C"]] for various words containing the [[voiceless velar plosive|hard C]] sound. According to Boon, during the ''MK'' games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only "correct it" when one the developers points out they should do it.<ref>{{cite web |title= Mortal Kombat Vs.

The original ''Mortal Kombat'' was developed with digitized [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s based on actors, as opposed to animated cartoon graphics.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[GamePro]] |author=Staff |page=117 |title=The Minds Behind Mortal Kombat II |issue=59 |month=June |year=1994}}</ref> Early ''Mortal Kombat'' games were known for their extensive use of [[palette swap]], a practice of re-coloring certain sprites to appear as different characters which was used for the ninja characters. In fact, many of the most popular characters have originated as a simple palette swaps.<ref name="mkad">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=Reptile Kombat Card video}}</ref> In the very first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques indicated the difference.<ref name="mkad"/> Later games added other ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters (beginning with [[Kitana (Mortal Kombat)|Kitana]]) initially also using just one base model (since ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''). All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series.

''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' brought the series into 3D, replacing the digitized fighters of previous games with [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] models. The team switched from digitized actors to [[motion capture]] technology: "To make the characters in video games more realistic, actors are being recruited to serve as models. Acclaim, the video-game company that made ''Mortal Kombat'', has created a special <nowiki>'motion capture studio'</nowiki> for this purpose. A martial-arts expert with as many as 100 electronic sensors taped to his body sends precise readings to a camera as he goes through his moves<U+2014>running, jumping, kicking, punching. The action is captured, digitized and synthesized into a <nowiki>'naked'</nowiki> wire-frame model stored in a computer. Those models can then be <nowiki>'dressed'</nowiki> with clothing, facial expressions and other characteristics by means of a computer technique called [[texture mapping]]."<ref>{{cite news |last= Elmer-Dewitt |first= Philip |date= 2001-06-24 |title= The Amazing Video Game Boom |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,162405,00.html |publisher=[[TIME]] |accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref> {{-}}

''Mortal Kombat'' included secret characters, secret games, and other [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]].

The [[Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] versions contains some unique eggs, such as "Fergality".<ref>[http://www.ugo.com/games/fergality Fergality - The Most Gruesome Finishing Moves Ever - UGO.com]</ref> The [[Sega Mega-CD]] version also contained an additional code (known as the "Dad's Code"), which changed the names of the fighters to that of characters from the classic [[BBC]] comedy series ''[[Dad's Army]]''.<ref>[http://uk.ign.com/cheats/games/mortal-kombat-1993-sega-cd-5611 Dad's Army Characters Sega CD Cheat Code from IGN.]</ref> Popular characters of [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] and [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]] were originally introduced as hidden enemies, becoming playable after returning in subsequent games.

Some Easter eggs originated from [[in-joke]]s between members of the development team. One example is "Toasty", which found its way into the game in the form of a small image of sound designer Dan Forden, who would appear in the corner of the screen during gameplay (after performing an [[uppercut]]) and yell the word "Toasty". This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]] when it happened in the Portal stage.<ref name="GameSpotHistory">{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_mortalk/p14.html|title=The History of Mortal Kombat - Mortal Kombat II (1993)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=Greeson, Jeff and O'Neill, Cliff|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> In ''Mortal Kombat 4'', Forden would say "Toasty! 3D!" after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_mortalk/p20.html |title=The History of Mortal Kombat - Mortal Kombat 4 (1997)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=Greeson, Jeff and O'Neill, Cliff|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> "Toasty" is also found in ''Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks'', appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that version,<ref>{{cite web |title= Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Review|url= http://reviews.cnet.com/xbox-games/mortal-kombat-shaolin-monks/4505-9582_7-31447785-2.html |quote= In addition, Dan "Toasty" Forden's voice returns once again to utter the famous line at all the right times. |accessdate= 2009-11-23}}</ref> and returned for the 2011's ''Mortal Kombat'' game. Yet another private joke was the hidden character "[[Noob Saibot]]", who appeared in various versions of the game. The character's name derived from two of the series' creators' surnames, [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]], spelled backward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters-noob-saibot |title=Noob Saibot - Top 11 Mortal Kombat Characters |publisher=[[UGO Networks|UGO.com]] |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> In addition, the character [[Ermac]]'s name came from the first ''Mortal Kombat'', which had "ERMAC5" (Error Macro 5) on its diagnostics screen; players presumed this dealt with some secret character. The development team decided to turn this rumor into an actual character, who was introduced in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as a secret character.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2006-10-11 |level=Ermac Kombat Card video}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_mortalk/p16.html|title=The History of Mortal Kombat - Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=Greeson, Jeff and O'Neill, Cliff|accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> The character [[Mokap]] is based upon [[Carlos Pesina]], who leads the motion capture team for modern ''MK'' games (and previously played Raiden in the first and second games).<ref name="GameSpotUMK3">{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=2006-10-11 |level=Mokap Kombat Card video the end}}</ref>

====Action-adventure games====
Besides the fighting games, there are three action titles that work as spin-offs from the ''Mortal Kombat'' storyline. ''[[Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero]]'' was released in 1997 for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64;<ref>{{cite web | title=Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero Release Dates (N64)| url=http://www.gamespot.com/n64/action/mortalkombatms/index.html?tag=result;title;0| publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero Release Dates (PlayStation)| url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/action/mortalkombatms/index.html?tag=result;title;1|publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> its story is focused on the first incarnation character of [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] and is focused in the timeline of before the first ''Mortal Kombat'' game.

=== Other media ===
====Films====
''Mortal Kombat'' was adapted into two major motion pictures, ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1995), and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'' (1997), both released by [[New Line Cinema]] (eventual corporate sibling, and later label, of ''Mortal Kombat'' rights holder [[Warner Bros.]]). Neither film was screened for critics prior to theatrical release. The first movie was released on August 18, 1995, grossing $23 million on its first weekend.<ref>{{cite news |title= CORRECTED: "Superbad" rushes to super spot at U.S. box off |date= 2007-08-19 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/08/19/us-boxoffice-correction-idUSN1920384020070819 |accessdate= 2010-04-03 | work=Reuters}}</ref> ''Mortal Kombat'', despite mixed reviews from critics, became a financial success, eventually grossing $70 million in the U.S. (and over $122 million worldwide) while jump starting the Hollywood career of its director [[Paul W.

====Literature====
[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Several ''Mortal Kombat'' comic books]] were based on the video game series, including the official ''Mortal Kombat'' and ''Mortal Kombat II'' comic books created by Tobias and advertised in the [[attract mode]]s on early versions of the first two games. In 1994, [[Malibu Comics]] launched an official ''MK'' comic book series, spawning two six-issue series ("Blood and Thunder" and "Battlewave"), along with several miniseries and one-shot special issues dedicated to specific characters, until its publication ended in August 1995. Two more comics were also made as [[tie-in]]s for ''Mortal Kombat 4'' and the DC Universe crossover game.<ref>[http://www.comicvine.com/search/?q=Mortal%20Kombat Mortal Kombat comics directory at Comic Vine]</ref> [[Jeff Rovin]] penned a novelization of the first ''Mortal Kombat'' game, which was published in June 1995 in order to coincide with the release of the movie.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Kombat-Jeff-Rovin/dp/1572970596 Amazon.com: Mortal Kombat (9781572970595): Jeff Rovin: Books]</ref> Novelizations of the both ''Mortal Kombat'' movies were also published, written by [[Martin Delrio]] and Jerome Preisler.

====Music====
''[[Mortal Kombat: The Album]]'', a techno album based on the first game was created for [[Virgin America]] by [[Lords of Acid]] members [[Praga Khan]] and Oliver Adams as [[The Immortals (band)|the Immortals]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715111301/http://immortals.pragakhan.com/biography.html |title=The Immortals-Biography |accessdate=2011-01-20}}</ref> Its iconic theme "Techno Syndrome", incorporating the "Mortal Kombat!" yell first shown in the ''Mortal Kombat'' commercial for home systems, was first released in 1993 as a single and was also used as a [[theme music]] for the ''Mortal Kombat'' film series. Each movie had their own soundtracks, as had the second video game (''Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack''). In addition, samples from the video games have occurred in music, most notably music by [[KMFDM]] (also included in the movie's soundtrack). The 2011 video game saw the release of ''[[Mortal Kombat: Songs Inspired By The Warriors]]'', a new soundtrack album featuring electronic music by various artists.

====Shows====
The franchise sparked two [[television program|television series]], the 1996 [[cartoon series]] ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' and the 1998 live-action series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]''. Neither series ran for more than one season.<ref name=gf>[http://www.gamefront.com/the-convoluted-blood-spattered-history-of-mortal-kombat-infographic/ The Convoluted, Blood-Spattered History of Mortal Kombat (Infographic) | GameFront]</ref> In 2010, [[Warner Premiere]] ordered a 10-episode web series inspired by the ''Rebirth'' short, titled ''[[Mortal Kombat: Legacy]]'' and also directed by Kevin Tancharoen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/23052 |title=Warner Premiere's 'Mortal Kombat' Tourney Goes Websides! |author=MrDisgusting |title=BLOODY-DISGUSTING.COM |publisher=BLOODY-DISGUSTING LLC|date=2011-01-14 |accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> The series was released for free on [[YouTube]] starting in April 2011, promoted by [[Machinima.com]].<ref>{{youtube|6s6UiEuCYXA|Mortal Kombat: Legacy: Ep. 1 - Jax, Sonya and Kano (Part 1)}}</ref>

====Miscellaneous====
An animated prequel to the first movie, titled ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]'', was released [[direct-to-video]] in 1995.<ref name=gf/> The stage show ''[[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour]]'' was also launched at the end of 1995. The tour expanded to 1996, and featured ''Mortal Kombat'' characters in a theatrical display on stage. [[Brady Games]] produced a [[collectible card game]] (CCG) called ''[[Mortal Kombat Kard Game]]'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mortal Kombat Kard Game (1995) |url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9274/mortal-kombat-kard-game |publisher=BoardGameGeek|accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> [[Score Entertainment]]'s 2005 CCG ''[[Epic Battles]]'' also used some of the ''Mortal Kombat'' characters.

According to [[IGN]], during the [[1990s]] "waves of imitators began to flood the market, filling arcades with a sea of blood from games like ''[[Time Killers]]'', ''[[Survival Arts]]'', and ''Guardians of the Hood''.

The series and its characters are also referenced in the various other works of popular culture, such as in the title of [[Powerglove (band)|Powerglove]]'s debut album ''[[Metal Kombat for the Mortal Man]]'' and the ''[[Workaholics]]'' episode "Model Kombat". According to ''Complex'' in 2012, "Years ago, ''MK'' became a phenomenon far outside gaming circles alone. Its name has become recognizable enough to be name dropped on sitcoms (''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' and ''[[Married...
