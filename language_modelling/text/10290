The '''sinicization of Tibet''' is the alleged change of Tibetan society to [[Han Chinese]] standards, by means of [[cultural assimilation]], [[human migration|migration]], and political ([[communism|communist]]) reform. [[Sinicization]] on the one hand is an inevitable consequence of the presence of a large number of [[Han Chinese]] in [[Tibet]] and on the other hand an active policy of the central government of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The active policy intends to make Tibet an integral part of the Chinese republic and to control Tibetan ambitions of independence. The result, whether in purpose or not, is the disappearance of certain elements of the [[Tibetan culture]], sometimes called [[cultural genocide]] by the government of Tibet in exile.<ref>Burbu, Dawa (2001) ''China's Tibet Policy'', Routledge, ISBN 978-0700704743, pp 100-124</ref><ref name="Samdup">Samdup, Tseten (1993) [http://www.tibet.com/Humanrights/poptrans.html Chinese population - Threat to Tibetan identity]</ref> The government of China denies of these accusations and sees the reform of the theocratic system and modernization of the Tibetan economy as beneficial to most Tibetans.

{{Main| People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet (1950<U+2013>1951)}}
In the decades preceding 1950 the region roughly corresponding to the modern day TAR was a de facto independent nation, with own [[Tibetan people|people]], [[Tibetan language|language]], [[Tibetan culture|culture]], and religions ([[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[B<U+00F6>n]]).  It also printed its own currency and postage, and conducted international relations with foreign countries. It claimed three provinces [[Amdo]], [[Kham]], and [[<U+00DC>-Tsang]] (but had only control of west Kham and <U+00DC>-Tsang). Since 1950, China reorganized the area somewhat, by making east Kham part of [[Sichuan]], and west Kham part of the newly established [[Tibet Autonomous Region]].<ref>Burbu, Dawa (2001) ''China's Tibet Policy'', Routledge, ISBN 978-0700704743, pp 86-99</ref>

China calls the entry of its army into Tibet a ''peaceful liberation''; exiled Tibetans and third parties call it an ''[[invasion]]'' followed by ''[[colonization]]''. However, the Chinese government points to [[Tibetan people#Demographics|population increases]] and quality of life improvements as justifications for their assertion of power in the historically Chinese-claimed region.

==Failures in agriculture==
The economy of Tibet is dominated by [[subsistence agriculture]], that is agriculture with a destination to provide for one's family proper only. For this reason the entrance of 35.000 Chinese troops in the 1950s weighed heavily on the food supplies in Tibet. At [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]]'s visit to [[Mao Zedong]] in [[Beijing]] in 1954, Mao informed him that he would migrate 40,000 Chinese farmers to Tibet.<ref>Forster-Latsch, H. & P. L. Renz S., in: [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Geschichte_und_Politik_Tibets/_Tibet_unter_chinesischer_Herrschaft Geschichte und Politik Tibets/ Tibet unter chinesischer Herrschaft], Wikibooks (German)</ref><ref>Horst S<U+00FC>dkamp, Breviarium der tibetischen Geschichte, p. 191, 1998 (German)</ref><ref>Golzio, Karl-Heinz & Pietro Bandini (2002) Die vierzehn Wiedergeburten des Dalai Lama, Scherz Verlag / Otto Wilhelm Barth, Bern / M<U+00FC>nchen, ISBN 3-502-61002-9 (German)</ref>

In the 1960s Chinese authorities forced Tibetan farmers to cultivate corn, instead of barley, the traditional crop of the [[Himalaya]] region, resulting in the first famine in Tibetan history. The harvests failed as farmers had feared and thousands of Tibetans starved from hunger.<ref name="Dragon LS">Shakya, Tsering (1999) ''The Dragon in the Land of Snows'', Columbia University Press, ISBN 978-0712665339</ref><ref name="TibCiv">Stein, Rolf (1972) ''Tibetan Civilization'', Stanford University Press, ISBN 0-8047-0806-1</ref>

==Sending Tibetan students to China proper==
As part of sinicization, Chinese authorities recruit many of high-ranking Tibetans from primary schools to [[China proper]], to attend Tibetan classes connected to local secondary schools or to a <U+201C>Tibetan Secondary Schools<U+201D> in Mainland China, where these students do not receive any Tibet-related education. In 1996, Chinese authorities declared a total enrolment of 12,590 Tibetan students in such classes.<ref>[http://www.tchrd.org/publications/topical_reports/next_generation_education-1997/ The Next Generation: State of Education in Tibet Today (1997)]</ref>

==Cultural Revolution==
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}
The Cultural Revolution was a revolution involving students and laborers of the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese communist party]] that was staged by the central government of China between 1966 and 1976 with the intention of preserving [[Maoism]] as the leading ideology of China. Secondarily it was a means to eliminate political opposition against Mao.<ref name="Mao's LR">MacFarquhar, Roderick & Michael Schoenhals (2006) ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Harvard University Press, ISBN 978-0-674-02332-1, p. 102</ref>

The Cultural Revolution affected the whole of China and as a result Tibet also suffered great excesses. Red guards attacked civilians that were seen as traitors to communism. Thousands of monasteries were looted and destroyed. Monks and nuns were forced to leave their monasteries to ''live a normal life'' and those who resisted were imprisoned. The prisoners were forced into [[hard labor]], maltreated, tortured, and executed.  <!--unsourced removed--> In addition, the [[Potala Palace]] was nearly harmed, but the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai prevented the Tibetan Red Guards from causing damage.

==Migration of Chinese (Mostly Han and Hui)==
The central government of the People's Republic of China follows an active  policy of migration of Chinese to Tibet, luring them there with attractive bonuses and favorable living conditions.  Since the end of the 1990s there have come to be more Chinese than Tibetans in Greater Tibet (but still a minority in the designated Tibetan Autonomous Region). As of 2003, the population consisted of an estimated 6 million ethnic Tibetans and 7.5 million non-Tibetans of different ethnic groups.<ref name="Samdup" /><ref>Pinteric, Uros (2003): http://www.sidip.org/SIDIP_files/pintericu_tibet.pdf ''International Status Of Tibet'', Association for Innovative Political Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia</ref>

In 2008, the capital Lhasa had 400,000 people,<ref>EN.TIBET.CN (11 January 2008) ''Tibet gives concern for vehicle exhaust''.</ref> mainly Chinese. {{Vague|date=May 2010}} In contrast, it had only 5,000 inhabitants in 1959.

In April 1991, the fourteenth Dalai Lama described the situation as follows: "The new Chinese settlers have created an alternate society: a Chinese apartheid which, denying Tibetans equal social and economic status in our own land, threatens to finally overwhelm and absorb us."    <!--removed reference that does not cit what it purports to-->

==Cultural identity==
Some young Tibetans feel that they are both Tibetans and Chinese and are fluent in both Tibetan and Mandarin.<ref>Hannue (2008). '' Dialogues Tibetan Dialogues Han: http://www.amazon.com/dp/9889799936 '' ISBN 9889799936</ref>

==Cultural genocide==
In [[1989]], [[Robert Badinter]], a high-profile [[France|French]] [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[lawyer]], participated in a well-known French television program devoted to  human rights, ''Apostrophes'', in the presence of the [[Tenzin Gyatso|14th Dala<U+00EF> Lama]]. Talking about the disappearance of the [[Tibetan culture]] in [[Tibet]], Robert Badinter used the term  "[[cultural genocide]]".<ref>''Les droits de l'homme Apostrophes'', A2 - 21 April 1989 - 01h25m56s, Web site of the [[Institut national de l'audiovisuel|INA]]: http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=Salonique&num_notice=5&total_notices=8</ref>  Later on, and for the first time in [[1993]], the  Dala<U+00EF> Lama used the same term, "cultural genocide", to describe the destruction of the Tibetan culture.<ref>http://www.dalailama.com/page.104.htm 10th March Archive</ref>  More recently, at the time of [[2008 Tibetan unrest]], he accused the Chinese of Cultural genocide in their crackdown.<ref>BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | 'Eighty killed' in Tibetan unrest: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7299212.stm</ref>

In 2008, professor Robert Barnett, director of the Program for Tibetan Studies at [[Columbia University]], stated that it was time for accusations of cultural genocide to be dropped: "I think we have to get over any suggestion that the Chinese are ill-intentioned or trying to wipe out Tibet."<ref>Robert Barnett, [http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4238 Seven Questions: What Tibetans Want], ''Foreign Policy'', March 2008.</ref> He also voiced his doubts in a book review he published in the ''New York Review of Books'':"Why, if Tibetan culture within Tibet is being 'fast erased from existence', [do] so many Tibetans within Tibet still appear to have a more vigorous cultural life, with over a hundred literary magazines in Tibetan, than their exile counterparts?"<ref>Robert Barnett, Thunder for Tibet, a review of Pico Iyer's book, ''The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama'', Knopf, 275 p., in ''The New York Review of Books'', vol. 55, number 9, May 29, 2008.</ref>
