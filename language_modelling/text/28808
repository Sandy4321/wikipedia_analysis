'''Parkhead Football Club''' was a founding member of the [[Scottish Junior Football League]] but the team now no longer exists. It played at [[Helenvale Park]] in [[Braidfauld|Parkhead]] , [[Glasgow]]. In the early years of the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] , '''Parkhead Juniors''' was, if any was, the dominant team. It appeared in 9 finals and won the cup 5 times - in '''[[1899]], [[1902]] ,[[ 1915]], [[1920]]''' and '''[[1924]]'''. Many of its players went on to fame in other clubs. Peter Dickson went to Alloa and [[Andy Auld]] played five times for the US national team.

[[Image:Parkhead_ticket.jpg|thumb|right|A ticket to the game - in 1903]]Across London Road from Westthorn Park is a football park , which used to be the home ground of [[Parkhead F.C.|Parkhead Juniors]] Football Club. Founded in [[1880]], it was the oldest team in the Scottish Junior League. They were one of the eight founder members in [[1895]] of what was to become the [[Scottish Junior Football League]]. 

[[Image:Parkhead_Juniors.jpg|thumb|left|Parkhead Juniors, Scottish Junior Cup finalists 1896]]They won the [[Scottish Junior Cup]] five times - [[1899]], [[1903]], [[1915]], [[1920]] and [[1924]] ), and appeared as finalists in 8 out of the 12 seasons from [[1911]]. "''If no single club could claim total dominance over the period (ie the first half of the 20th century) Parkhead at least merit an honourable mention with three league titles (one shared); four Glasgow Cups; two Junior cups and three other appearances in the final''". On the 10th of April 2004, at the semi-final of the 1923/24  season they faced [[Bridgeton]] Waverley at [[Celtic Park]] they faced a crowd of 11,500 (even though the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] cup final was taking place at [[Hampden Park]] at the same time).

The entrance was in Methven Street. Parkhead Juniors seem, like a lot of [[Lilybank]] , to have disappeared from history. Though they were still playing in the 1950s, they went defunct in June [[1963]].
