'''Route 5''' is the only state highway in Missouri to cross the entire state. To the north, it continues into Iowa as [[Iowa Highway 5]] and to the south it enters Arkansas as [[Highway 5 (Arkansas)|Highway 5]]. It is the longest state highway in Missouri, and, with only a few exceptions, is two-lane for its entire length. Business Route 5 serves Milan and Ava.

==Route description==
[[File:MO 5 turns onto MO 64 (Jefferson Ave) in Lebanon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|MO 5 southbound turns left onto Route 64 (Jefferson Ave) in Lebanon.]]

From the Arkansas state line, Route 5 is a continuation of [[Arkansas Highway 5]].  After preceding North 9 miles, Route 5 enters the town of Gainesville.  The Route turns east to form a [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] for two miles on [[US Route 160|US 160]]. After the concurrency, Route 5 Continues North West for Twelve miles.  Near the town of Wasola, the road form a three mile concurrency with [[Missouri Route 95|Route 95]].  As soon as the concurrency ends, Route 5 enters [[Douglas County, MO|Douglas County]].

Entering the Town of [[Ava, MO|Ava]], seventeen miles north of the county line, Route 5 produces a [[Business Route]]. Afterwards, Route 5 intersects [[Missouri Route 14|Route 14]].  Route 5 has a two mile concurrency with [[Missouri Route 76|Route 76]].  After leaving the concurrency, the Route continues for 10 miles before leaving the county. 

Entering [[Wright County, MO|Wright county]] near [[Mansfield, MO|Mansfield]], Route 5 has a one mile [[Concurrency (road)|duplex]] with [[US 60]] (as a [[Interstate Highway standards|freeway]]). Eleven miles north of US 60, the city of [[Hartville, MO]] and [[Missouri Route 38|Route 38]] are passed. Wright County is left 20 miles north of Hartville.

Entering [[Laclede County, MO|Laclede County]], Route 5 passes [[Evergreen, MO|the City of Evergreen]].  Twelve miles north of Lebanon, Route 5 intersects [[Interstate 44 in Missouri|I-44]].  Between Lebanon and [[Camdenton, MO|Camdenton]], the road has undergone some major straightening and several older alignments are visible.  Just south of Camdenton is the southern junction with [[Missouri Route 7|Route 7]].  The roads overlap to North of Camdenton, where 5 and 7 both cross [[U.S. Route 54 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 54]]. The highway continues North, leaving the [[Ozarks]], and crosses the [[Lake of the Ozarks]] at [[Hurricane Deck, Missouri|Hurricane Deck]] [[Hurricane Deck Bridge|Bridge]].Twenty-two miles north of Lake of the Ozarks, and just east of [[Versailles, MO|Versailles]], the highway forms a short concurrency with [[Route 52 (Missouri)|Route 52]]. Continuing North for fourteen miles, Route 5 enters the town of [[Tipton, MO]].  For nearly four miles, Route 5 and [[US 50]] form a duplex traveling west. Splitting from US 50, Route 5 continues north for twenty more miles before intersecting [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|I-70]].  Three miles north of the interstate, Route 5 forms a triplex with [[US 40]] and [[U.S. Route 24 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 24]], in [[Marceline, MO|the city of Marceline]].  After one mile, Route 24 leaves the concurrency heading west. Continuing north for one more mile, US 40 leaves the concurrency as well.

Near the town of [[Fayette, MO]], [[Missouri Route 240]] forms a duplex with Route 5. After about eight miles, the duplex curves west, and Route 240 exits to the south of Route 5. When Route 5 reaches [[Glasgow, MO]], it returns to a northerly track. Thirteen Miles to the north, Route 5 enters a five mile Concurrency with [[US 24]].  Continuing north for 25 miles, Route 5 joins [[US 36]] (currently a [[divided highway]] and proposed future [[Interstate 72 (Missouri)|Interstate 72]]), and has a long western duplex with that route.

South of [[Milan, MO]], Route 5 turns north out of the Concurrency. At Milan, it joins [[Route 6 (Missouri)|Route 6]] for eight miles (13 km) as a bypass of the town before Route 6 turns east. Business Route 5 serves the city, passing directly through on an older alignment of the highway.  Near [[Unionville, MO]], Route 5 forms a short duplex with [[U.S. Route 136 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 136]]. After continuing north for eight miles, the Route crosses the state line and turns into [[Iowa Highway 5]].

==History==
Other than minor realignments, Route 5 is the same as when it was created in 1922.<ref name="backlin-22">[http://www.cosmos-monitor.com/road/mo/hist/maps/etc/map1922-backlin.html Missouri Highways (unofficial) - 1922 map of Centennial Road System<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Improvements between Lebanon and Camdenton==
Beginning in the summer of 2008, [[MoDOT]] began a [http://www.modot.org/Shared4-Lane/Shared4Lane.htm project] to convert Route 5 into a "shared four-lane" highway between Lebanon and Camdenton.  A shared four-lane road can be constructed largely within the same footprint as a two-lane road, but allows for alternating passing lanes in each direction.  A number of roadways in Europe are built in this way, but Missouri is among the first to do so in the U.S., having first used the method on separate segments of [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|US 63]] and [[Missouri Route 37|Route 37]].  The project has been completed.
