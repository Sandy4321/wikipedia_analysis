'''Pacaya''' is an active [[complex volcano]] in [[Guatemala]], which first erupted approximately 23,000&nbsp;years ago and has erupted at least 23 times since the [[Spanish conquest]] of Guatemala.  After being [[Dormant volcano|dormant]] for a century, it erupted violently in [[1965]] and has been erupting continuously since then.  Much of its activity is [[Strombolian eruption|Strombolian]], but 
occasional [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]] eruptions also occur, sometimes showering the nearby city of [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] with ash.

Pacaya lies approximately 25 to 30&nbsp;km south of Guatemala City, is easily accessible from [[Antigua Guatemala]] and Guatemala City itself, and so is a popular tourist attraction.  In the late 1990s there were frequent armed robberies on its slopes, which in turn affected tourism. However, by 2006 reports of violence decreased in line with increased security efforts by the government, and Guatemalan as well as foreign tourism increased.

==Geological history==

Pacaya is part of a chain of volcanoes stretching along the [[Pacific]] coast of Guatemala, formed by the [[subduction]] of the [[Cocos Plate]] underneath the [[Caribbean Plate]].  It lies on the southern edge of a sizable [[caldera]] formed in the [[Pleistocene]] age which contains [[Lago de Amatitl<U+00E1>n]].  The caldera has been the source of at least nine very large explosions over the last 300,000&nbsp;years, erupting a total of about 70&nbsp;km<U+00B3> of [[magma]].

Since the last caldera-forming eruption 23,000&nbsp;years ago several smaller vents within and around the caldera have seen eruptive activity.  Pacaya is the largest post-caldera volcano, and has been one of [[Central America]]'s most active volcanoes over the last 500&nbsp;years.  It has erupted at least 23 times since the [[Spanish conquest]].

About 1,100&nbsp;years ago, the volcano's edifice collapsed, causing a huge [[landslide]].  Deposits from the landslide travelled about 25&nbsp;km from the volcano down to the Pacific [[coastal plain]].  The landslide left a large crater, within which the current active cone has grown.  The presence of a magma chamber at shallow depths beneath Pacaya means that distortion of the cone leading to instability and future landslides remains a hazard to the surrounding areas.

With its almost continuous activity and proximity to both Guatemala City and Antigua Guatemala, the volcano has been a popular location for [[tourism]].  The volcano and surrounding area now lie within Pacaya National Park, created to manage tourism in the area and generate income from tour groups, who are charged a small fee to enter the park.

Following the end of the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] in [[1996]], endemic poverty and the large numbers of guns held by the general populace led to an upsurge in crime rates, and Pacaya was one of a number of popular tourist sites where armed robbery became a serious risk.  Tour groups began visiting the volcano with armed guards, and incidents of robbery on the mountain have become very rare.

During 2006 a slight increase in Pacaya's volcanic activity allowed for the creation of several lava rivers that slowly flow down its slope. Word about this phenomenon spread, and local tourism increased significantly.
