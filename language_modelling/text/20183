Most of director Jeon Kyu-hwan's previous films, including [[Berlinale]]-featured ''Varanasi'' and ''Dance Town'', have dealt with the underbelly of society. ''The Weight'' is his fifth feature-length film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Claire|title=BIFF to heat up Busan|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120928000512|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=28 September 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
Jung is the [[mortician]] at the [[morgue]] who has to heavily rely on medicine for his severe [[tuberculosis]] and [[arthritis]]. Despite his illness, cleansing and dressing the dead is a noble and even beautiful work to him. Jung is the last living person who silently takes care of the dead. So for him, his life at the morgue is both a reality and a fantasy while the corpses are his models and friends for his paintings, his sole living pleasure.

Born with a [[hunchback]] and left at an orphanage, Jung was adopted by a woman who hid him away in the attic only to use him as a child slave for her dress shop. The woman's own child Dong-bae is younger than Jung; she has always wanted to become a woman, loathing her own male body. While Jung feels affection and sympathy for his younger stepsister, he feels burdened by Dong-bae's struggles. Under the weight of life and death carried by the dead bodies that he faces each day coupled with his love-hate relationship with Dong-bae, Jung endures the pain and thirst that he feels like a camel crossing a desolate desert in silence. Then he quietly prepares his biggest, his last gift for his sister.
