'''Dante Alighieri''', or simply '''Dante''' (mid-May to mid-June 1265 - [[September 14|September 13/14]], 1321), was an Italian poet from [[Florence]]. His [[Magnum opus|central work]], the ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'' (originally called ''"Commedia"'' and later called ''"Divina"'' (divine) by [[Boccaccio]] hence "''Divina Commedia''"), is considered the greatest literary work composed in the [[Italian language]] and a masterpiece of world [[literature]].<ref>{{citebook|last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=The Western Canon|date=1994}}</ref> He was christened '''Durante degli Alighieri''' (''Durante of the Alighieri family''); ''Dante'' is a shortened form of ''Durante''.

In [[Italian language|Italian]] he is known as "the Supreme Poet" (''il Sommo Poeta'').
Dante, [[Petrarch]] and [[Boccaccio]] are also known as "the three fountains" or "the three crowns". Dante is also called the "Father of the Italian language". The first biography written on him was by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (1313-1375), who wrote the ''Trattatello in laude di Dante''.

==Life==
The exact date of Dante's birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in ''[[La Vita Nuova]]'', "[[Divine_Comedy#Inferno|the Inferno]]" (''Halfway through the journey we are living'', implying that Dante was around 35 years old, as the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalms, 89, 10) is 70 years, and as the imaginary travel took place in 1300 Dante must have been born around 1265). Some verses of "[[the Paradise]]" also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of [[Gemini]] - ''"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious"'', [[Paradise]] XXII 151-154), but these cannot be considered definitive statements by Dante about his birth. However, in 1265 the Sun was in Gemini approximately during the period 11 May to 11 June. His birth date is listed as "probably in the end of May" by [[Robert Hollander]] in "Dante" in ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', volume 4. In summary, most students of Dante's life believe that he was born between about the middle of May and about the middle of June 1265, but there is little likelihood a definite date will ever be known.

Dante pretended that his family descended from the ancient Romans (''Inferno'', XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was [[Cacciaguida]] degli Elisei (''Paradiso'', XV, 135), of no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph (see politics section) who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the [[Battle of Montaperti]] in the mid 13th century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family enjoyed some protective prestige and status.

Dante's family was prominent in Florence, with loyalties to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]], a political alliance that supported the [[Papacy]] and which was involved in complex opposition to the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibellines]], who were backed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The poet's mother was Bella degli Abati. She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, as widowers had social limitations in these matters. This woman definitely bore two children, Dante's brother Francesco and sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, in 1277, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Messer Manetto Donati. Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a [[Notary public|notary]]. Dante had already fallen in love with another girl, [[Beatrice Portinari]] (known also as Bice). Years after his marriage to Gemma, he met Beatrice again. He had become interested in writing verse, and although he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice, he never mentioned his wife Gemma in any of his poems.

Dante fought in the front rank of the Guelph cavalry at the [[battle of Campaldino]] (June 11, 1289). This victory brought forth a reformation of the Florentine constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to be enrolled in one of "the arts". So Dante entered the guild of physicians and apothecaries. In following years, his name is frequently found recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic.

Dante had several children with Gemma. As often happens with significant figures, many people subsequently claimed to be Dante's offspring; however, it is likely that Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, Gabrielle Alighieri and Antonia were truly his children. Antonia became a nun with the name of Sister Beatrice.

===Education and poetry===
Not much is known about Dante's education, and it is presumed he studied at home. It is known that he studied [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] poetry, at a time when the [[Sicilian School]] (''Scuola poetica siciliana''), a cultural group from [[Sicily]], was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the [[Occitan]] poetry of the [[troubadours]] and the Latin poetry of [[classical antiquity]] (with a particular devotion to [[Virgil]]).

During the "Secoli Bui" ([[Dark Ages]]), Italy had become a mosaic of small states, Sicily being the largest one, at the time under the [[house of Anjou|Angevine dominations]], and as far (culturally and politically) from Tuscany as [[Occitania]] was: the regions did not share a language, culture or easy communications. Nevertheless, we can assume that Dante was a keen up-to-date intellectual with international interests.

[[Image:Dante Alighieri01.jpg|thumb|Statue of Dante at the [[Uffizi]], Florence.]]
When he was nine years old he met [[Beatrice Portinari]], daughter of Folco Portinari, with whom he fell in love "at first sight", and apparently without even having spoken to her. He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but he never knew her well; he effectively set the example for the so-called "[[courtly love]]". It is hard now to understand what this love actually comprised, but something extremely important for Italian culture was happening. It was in the name of this love that Dante gave his imprint to the Stil Novo and would lead poets and writers to discover the themes of Love (''Amore''), which had never been so emphasized before. Love for Beatrice (as in a different manner [[Petrarch]] would show for his Laura) would apparently be the reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante tried to find a refuge in [[Latin literature]]. The ''[[Convivio]]'' reveals that he had read [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius's]] ''De consolatione philosophiae'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''De amicitia''. He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in [[Santa Maria Novella]]. He took part in the disputes that the two principal [[Mendicant order|mendicant]] orders ([[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrine of the mystics and of Saint [[Bonaventure]], the latter presenting Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]' theories.

At 18, Dante met [[Guido Cavalcanti]], [[Lapo Gianni]], [[Cino da Pistoia]] and soon after [[Brunetto Latini]]; together they became the leaders of ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' ("The Sweet New Style"). Brunetto later received a special mention in the ''Divine Comedy'' (''Inferno'', XV, 28), for what he had taught Dante.
''Nor speaking less on that account, I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are His most known and most eminent companions''. Some fifty poetical components by Dante are known (the so-called ''[[The Rime|Rime]]'', rhymes), others being included in the later ''Vita Nuova'' and ''Convivio''. Other studies are reported, or deduced from ''Vita Nuova'' or the ''Comedy'', regarding painting and music.

===Florence and politics===
Dante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph-Ghibelline]] conflict. He fought in the [[battle of Campaldino]] ([[June 11]], [[1289]]), with the Florentine Guelphs against [[Arezzo]] Ghibellines, then in 1294 he was among the escorts of [[Charles Martel d'Anjou]] (son of [[Charles of Anjou]]) while he was in Florence.

To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to actually practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required that nobles who wanted public office had to be enrolled in one of the [[Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri]], so Dante obtained admission to the apothecaries' guild. This profession was not entirely inapt, since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little, but he held various offices over a number of years in a city undergoing political unrest.

After defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (''Guelfi Bianchi'') -- Dante's party, led by [[Vieri dei Cerchi]] -- and the Black Guelphs (''Guelfi Neri''), led by [[Corso Donati]]. Although initially the split was along family lines, ideological differences rose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. Initially the Whites were in power and expelled the Blacks.

In response, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, [[Charles of Valois|Charles de Valois]], brother of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] king of [[France]], was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for [[Tuscany]]. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles de Valois would eventually have received other unofficial instructions. So the council sent a delegation to [[Rome]] to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.

===Exile and death===
[[Image:Dante.deathmask.jpg|thumb|A recreated [[death mask]] of Dante Alighieri (in [[Palazzo Vecchio]], Florence).]]
Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time ([[November 01]], [[1301]]), [[Charles de Valois]] entered Florence with Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed and Messer Cante dei [[Gabrielli]] di [[Gubbio]] was appointed ''[[Podest<U+00E0>]]'' of Florence. Dante was condemned to exile for two years, and ordered to pay a large fine. The poet was still in Rome, where the Pope had "suggested" he stay, and was therefore considered an absconder. He did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty, and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile, and if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could be burned at the stake. (The city council of Florence finally passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence in June 2008.<ref>Malcolm Moore [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2145378/Dante's-infernal-crimes-forgiven.html "Dante's infernal crimes forgiven",] ''Daily Telegraph'', 17 June 2008. Retrieved on 18 June 2008.</ref>)

The poet took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies, and vowed to become a party of one. At this point, he began sketching the foundation for the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', a work in 100 [[canto]]s, divided into three books of thirty-three cantos each, with a single introductory canto.

He went to [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] as a guest of [[Bartolomeo I della Scala]], then moved to [[Sarzana]] in [[Liguria]]. Later, he is supposed to have lived in [[Lucca]] with Madame Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in ''Purgatorio'', XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources say that he was also in [[Paris]] between 1308 and 1310. Other sources, even less trustworthy, take him to [[Oxford]].

In 1310, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of [[Luxembourg]], marched 5,000 troops into Italy. Dante saw in him a new [[Charlemagne]] who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also re-take Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city, suggesting several particular targets that coincided with his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote the first two books of the ''Divine Comedy''.
[[Image:Dante Statue.JPG|left|thumb|Statue of Dante in the Piazza di Santa Croce in Florence]]
In Florence, [[Baldo d'Aguglione]] pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return; however, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to ''Arrigo'' (Henry VII), and he was not recalled.

In 1312, Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs too and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. In 1313, Henry VII died, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where [[Cangrande I della Scala]] allowed him to live in a certain security and, presumably, in a fair amount of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (''Paradiso'', XVII, 76).

In 1315, Florence was forced by [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to people in exile, including Dante. But Florence required that as well as paying a sum of money, these exiles would do public [[penance]]. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest, on condition that he go to Florence to swear that he would never enter the town again. Dante refused to go. His death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. Dante still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity. He addresses the pain of exile in ''Paradiso'', XVII (55-60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:

{| align="center"
|-
|''... Tu lascerai ogne cosa diletta'' || "...You shall leave everything you love most:
|-
|'' pi<U+00F9> caramente; e questo <U+00E8> quello strale'' || this is the arrow that the bow of exile
|-
|'' che l'arco de lo essilio pria saetta.'' || shoots first. You are to know the bitter taste
|-
|''Tu proverai s<U+00EC> come sa di sale'' || of others' bread, how salty it is, and know
|-
|'' lo pane altrui, e come <U+00E8> duro calle'' || how hard a path it is for one who goes
|-
|'' lo scendere e 'l salir per l'altrui scale...'' || ascending and descending others' stairs..."
|-
|}

As for the hope of returning to Florence, he describes it wistfully, as if he had already accepted its impossibility, (''Paradiso'', XXV, 1&ndash;9):

{| align="center"
|-
|''Se mai continga che 'l poema sacro'' || If it ever come to pass that the sacred poem
|-
|''al quale ha posto mano e cielo e terra,'' ||to which both heaven and earth have set their hand
|-
|''s<U+00EC> che m'ha fatto per molti anni macro,'' ||so as to have made me lean for many years
|-
|''vinca la crudelt<U+00E0> che fuor mi serra'' ||should overcome the cruelty that bars me
|-
|''del bello ovile ov'io dormi' agnello,'' ||from the fair sheepfold where I slept as a lamb,
|-
|''nimico ai lupi che li danno guerra;'' ||an enemy to the wolves that make war on it,
|-
|''con altra voce omai, con altro vello'' ||with another voice now and other fleece
|-
|''ritorner<U+00F2> poeta, e in sul fonte'' ||I shall return a poet and at the font
|-
|''del mio battesmo prender<U+00F2> 'l cappello . . .'' ||of my baptism take the [[laurel wreath|laurel crown]]...
|-
|}
Of course it never happened. Prince [[Guido Novello da Polenta]] invited him to [[Ravenna]] in 1318, and he accepted. He finished the ''Paradiso'', and died in 1321 (at the age of 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, perhaps of [[malaria]] contracted there. Dante was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, [[praetor]] of [[Venice]] in 1483, took care of his remains by building a better tomb.

On the grave, some verses of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, dedicated to Florence:
:''parvi Florentia mater amoris''
:"Florence, mother of little love"

Eventually, Florence came to regret Dante's exile, and made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body at Ravenna refused to comply, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nevertheless, in 1829, a tomb was built for him in Florence in the basilica of [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce]]. That [[cenotaph|tomb has been empty]] ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads ''Onorate l'altissimo poeta'' - which roughly translates as "Honour the most exalted poet". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the ''Inferno'', depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in Limbo. The continuation of the line, ''L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita'' ("his spirit, which had left us, returns"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.

Recently, a recreation of Dante's face was made, showing that his features were much more ordinary than once thought.<ref name="nosejob">{{cite news

[[Image:DanteDetail.jpg|thumb|Dante, poised between the mountain of purgatory and the city of Florence, displays the famous incipit ''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'' in a detail of Domenico di Michelino's painting, Florence 1465.]]
:''See also [[:Category:Works by Dante Alighieri]].''
The ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' describes Dante's journey through [[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Hell]] (''Inferno''), [[Divine Comedy#Purgatorio|Purgatory]] (''Purgatorio''), and [[Divine Comedy#Paradiso|Paradise]] (''Paradiso''), guided first by the Roman poet [[Virgil]] and then by [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]], the subject of his love and of another of his works, ''[[La Vita Nuova]]''. While the vision of Hell, the ''Inferno,'' is vivid for modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. ''Purgatorio,'' the most lyrical and human of the three, also has the most poets in it; ''Paradiso,'' the most heavily theological, has the most beautiful and ecstatic mystic passages in which Dante tries to describe what he confesses he is unable to convey (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: "all'alta fantasia qui manc<U+00F2> possa" - "at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe," ''Paradiso,'' XXXIII, 142).

Dante wrote the ''Comedy'' in a new language he called "Italian", based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, with some elements of Latin and of the other regional dialects. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the [[Italian language]] was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is nicknamed ''la langue de Dante.'' Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first (among others such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]) to break from standards of publishing in only Latin (the languages of [[liturgy]], history, and scholarship in general). This break allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience - setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future.

[[Image:Portrait de Dante.jpg|thumb|left|Profile portrait of Dante, by [[Sandro Botticelli]] (1444&ndash;1510).]]
Readers often cannot understand how such a serious work may be called a "comedy". In Dante's time, all serious scholarly works were written in Latin (a tradition that would persist for several hundred years more, until the waning years of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) and works written in any other language were assumed to be more trivial in nature.
Furthermore, the word "[[comedy]]," in the classical sense, refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events not only tended towards a happy or "amusing" ending, but an ending influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, the progression of Dante's pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.

Dante's other works include the ''[[Convivio]]'' ("The Banquet")<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=2&idlang=UK|title=Banquet|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; ''[[Monarchia]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danteonline.it/english/opere.asp?idope=4&idlang=UK |title=Monarchia|publisher=Dante online|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> which was condemned and burned after Dante's death<ref>Anthony K.

The ''Vita Nuova'' contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular - both in the ''Vita Nuova'' and in the ''Convivio'' - instead of the Latin that was almost universally used. References to ''Divina Commedia'' are in the format (book, canto, verse), e.g., (''Inferno'', XV, 76).
