==Biography==
===Early years===

Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, known to his family and friends as Wilhelm, was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], one of the [[German States]], on March 25, 1825. His father, Wilhelm Fritzsche, was a [[journeyman]] [[shoemaker]].<ref name=Ford>Graham Ford, "Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche," in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), ''Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 327-328.</ref>

Fritzsche was forced to work from an early age, taking his first job as a [[cigar|cigarmaker]] in 1840 at the age of 15.<ref name=Ford />

===Political career===

Fritzsche became politically active late in the 1840s.<ref name=Spier>Anne Spier, "German-Speaking Peoples," in Dirk Hoerder with Christiane Harzig (eds.), ''The Immigrant Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s: An Annotated Bibliography: Volume 3: Migrants from Southern and Western Europe.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1987; pg. 513.</ref>

In 1849 Fritzsche was arrested for his participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] in the city of [[Dresden]].<ref name=Spier />

Fritzsche was a founding member of the Leipzig Educational Association in February 1861 and together with [[Julius Vahlteich]] split away from that group the following year to form a new workers' organization called Vorw<U+00E4>rts (Forward).<ref name=Ford /> With the establishment of the [[General German Workers' Association]] (ADAV) in May 1863, Fritzche became a founding member of that organization and was elected to the organization's governing Executive Committee.<ref name=Ford /> He would become Vice President of the ADAV in 1865 and briefly served as President of that organization in November 1865.<ref name=Ford />

The November 30, 1865 General Meeting of the ADAV voted a motion of no confidence in Fritzsche's leadership and he returned to Leipzig, resigning both his Vice Presidency and his position as the organization's official representative in that city.<ref name=Ford />

Fritzsche subsequently turned his attention to [[trade union]] organization, serving as one of the principals establishing the [[General German Cigar Workers' Union]] (ADZV), of which he was President from 1865 until 1878.<ref name=Ford /> Fritzche also became a newspaper editor for the first time in this period, producing the weekly paper of the union, ''Der Botschafter,'' from 1866 until its ban by the authorities in 1879.<ref name=Ford />

In July 1868 Fritzsche was elected to the North German regional Reichstag.<ref name=Ford />

Disagreement with the leadership of [[Johann Baptist von Schweitzer]] led him to leave the ADAV in the summer of 1869.<ref name=Ford /> While Fritzsche was a delegate to the founding congress of the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP) in August 1869, he does not seem to have been a member of the new organization, instead rejoining the ADAV in 1872.<ref name=Ford /> Whatever his misgivings about membership in the SDAP, Fritzsche emerged as a leading voice in favor of unity of the two organizations, and he was selected as a delegate to the [[Gotha Congress|Unity Congress]] held at [[Gotha]].<ref name=Ford />

The Gotha Congress resulted in the formation of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD), forerunner of the modern [[Social-Democratic Party of Germany]].

In 1877 and 1878, Fritzche was elected a member of the [[Reichstag]] on the ticket of the Socialist Workers' Party, in which he remained a member until his emigration to America in 1881.<ref name=Spier /> 

Frizsche found himself expelled from [[Berlin]] in 1879 after passage of the [[Anti-Socialist Laws]].<ref name=Ford /> He returned to Leipzig and established a new newspaper there called ''Der Wanderer'' (The Wanderer).<ref name=Ford /> He was dispatched to London and America for the first time in 1880, where he spoke on behalf of the Socialist Workers' Party, attempting to build international support for the German socialist movement.<ref name=Ford />

===Newspaper editor in America===

Harassed constantly by the authorities,  Fritzche emigrated to America in 1881, settling in the city of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], where he edited the labor newspaper the ''Philadelphia Tageblatt'' (Philadelphia Daily News).<ref name=Spier />

===Later years===

After his time editing the ''Tageblatt,'' Fritzsche retired from politics to life as an innkeeper in Philadelphia.<ref name=Spier />

===Death and legacy===

Fritzsche died in Philadelphia on February 5, 1905.<ref name=Spier />
