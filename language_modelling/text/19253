'''Kraken''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>kre<U+026A>k<U+0259>n}} or {{IPA-en|<U+02C8>kr<U+0251><U+02D0>k<U+0259>n|}})<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=Second}}</ref> are mythical [[sea monster]]s of gargantuan size, said to have dwelt off the coasts of [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]]. The sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the beasts have made them common ocean-dwelling monsters in various fictional works (see [[Kraken in popular culture]]). The legend may actually have originated from sightings of real [[giant squid]] that are variously estimated to grow to {{convert|13|<U+2013>|15|m|-1|abbr=on}} in length, including the tentacles.<ref name=OShea>O'Shea, S. 2003.

[[Image:Denys de Montfort Poulpe Colossal.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre D<U+00E9>nys de Montfort]]'s "Poulpe Colossal" attacks a merchant ship.]]
Even though the name ''kraken'' never appears in the [[Norse saga]]s, there are similar sea monsters, the ''hafgufa'' and ''lyngbakr'', both described in ''[[Orvar-Odd|<U+00D6>rvar-Odds saga]]'' as a giant spider-creature. the Norwegian text from c. 1250, ''[[Konungs skuggsj<U+00E1>]]''.<ref>Or ''Speculum Regale'', the "King's Mirror". The text describes a massive sea creature as large as an island. It is rarely seen by seamen and fishermen, and it is speculated that there are only one or two in the world. The Kraken eats by opening its massive mouth, belches up smaller fish, and eats the larger fish which come to feed upon them.</ref> [[Carolus Linnaeus]] included kraken as [[cephalopods]] with the scientific name '''''Microcosmus''''' in the first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735), a taxonomic classification of living organisms, but excluded the animal in later editions. Kraken were also extensively described by [[Erik Pontoppidan]], [[Diocese of Bj<U+00F8>rgvin|bishop of Bergen]], in his "Natural History of Norway" (Copenhagen, 1752<U+2013>3). Early accounts, including Pontoppidan's, describe the kraken as an animal "the size of a floating island" whose real danger for sailors was not the creature itself, but the [[whirlpool]] it created after quickly descending back into the ocean. However, Pontoppidan also described the destructive potential of the giant beast: "It is said that if it grabbed the largest warship, it could manage to pull it down to the bottom of the ocean" (Sj<U+00F6>gren, 1980). Kraken were always distinct from [[sea serpent]]s, also common in Scandinavian lore ([[J<U+00F6>rmungandr]] for instance). A representative early description is given by the Swede ''Jacob Wallenberg'' in his book ''Min son p<U+00E5> galejan'' ("My son on the galley") from 1781:

<blockquote>... Kraken, also called the Crab-fish, which [according to the pilots of Norway] is not that huge, for heads and tails counted, he is no larger than our [[<U+00D6>land]] is wide [i.e. less than 16 km] ... He stays at the sea floor, constantly surrounded by innumerable small fishes, who serve as his food and are fed by him in return: for his meal, if I remember correctly what E. Pontoppidan writes, lasts no longer than three months, and another three are then needed to digest it. His excrements nurture in the following an army of lesser fish, and for this reason, fishermen plumb after his resting place ... Gradually, Kraken ascends to the surface, and when he is at ten to twelve [[fathom]]s, the boats had better move out of his vicinity, as he will shortly thereafter burst up, like a floating island, spurting water from his dreadful nostrils and making ring waves around him, which can reach many miles. Could one doubt that this is the [[Leviathan]] of [[Book of Job|Job]]?</blockquote>

According to Pontoppidan, Norwegian fishermen often took the risk of trying to fish over kraken, since the catch was so good. If a fisherman had an unusually good catch, they used to say to each other, "You must have fished on Kraken." Pontoppidan also claimed that the monster was sometimes mistaken for an island, and that some maps that included islands that were only sometimes visible were actually indicating kraken. Pontoppidan also proposed that a young specimen of the monster once died and was washed ashore at [[Alstahaug]] ([[Bengt Sj<U+00F6>gren]], 1980).
[[Image:Giant octopus attacks ship.jpg|thumb|right|Imaginary view of a gigantic octopus seizing a ship.]]
Since the late 18th century, kraken have been depicted in a number of ways, primarily as [[gigantic octopus|large octopus-like creatures]], and it has often been alleged that Pontoppidan's kraken might have been based on sailors' observations of the [[giant squid]]. In the earliest descriptions, however, the creatures were more [[crab]]- like than [[octopus]]-like, and generally possessed traits that are associated with large [[whale]]s rather than with giant squid. Some traits of kraken resemble undersea [[volcanic activity]] occurring in the [[Iceland]] region, including bubbles of water; sudden, dangerous currents; and appearance of new islets.

In 1802, the French [[malacologist]] [[Pierre Denys de Montfort|Pierre D<U+00E9>nys de Montfort]] recognized the existence of two kinds of giant octopus in ''Histoire Naturelle G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale et Particuli<U+00E8>re des Mollusques'', an encyclopedic description of mollusks. Montfort claimed that the first type, the ''kraken octopus'', had been described by Norwegian sailors and American whalers, as well as ancient writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]]. The much larger second type, the ''[[gigantic octopus|colossal octopus]]'' (depicted in the above image), was reported to have attacked a sailing vessel from [[Saint-Malo]], off the coast of [[Angola]].

Montfort later dared more sensational claims. He proposed that ten British warships that had mysteriously disappeared one night in 1782 must have been attacked and sunk by giant octopuses. Unfortunately for Montfort, the British knew what had happened to the ships, resulting in a disgraceful revelation for Montfort. Pierre D<U+00E9>nys de Montfort's career never recovered and he died starving and poor in [[Paris]] around 1820 (Sj<U+00F6>gren, 1980). In defence of Pierre D<U+00E9>nys de Montfort, many of his sources for the "kraken octopus" probably described the very real giant squid, ''[[Architeuthis]]'', proven to exist in 1857.

&nbsp;Below the thunders of the upper deep;<br />
&nbsp;Far far beneath in the abysmal sea,<br />
&nbsp;His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep<br />
&nbsp;The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee<br />
&nbsp;About his shadowy sides; above him swell<br />
&nbsp;Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;<br />
&nbsp;And far away into the sickly light,<br />
&nbsp;From many a wondrous grot and secret cell<br />
&nbsp;Unnumber'd and enormous polypi<br />
&nbsp;Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.<br />
&nbsp;There hath he lain for ages, and will lie<br />
&nbsp;Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,<br />
&nbsp;Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;<br />
&nbsp;Then once by man and angels to be seen,<br />
&nbsp;In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.<br />

In 1830, possibly aware of Pierre D<U+00E9>nys de Montfort's work, [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] published his popular poem "The Kraken" (essentially an irregular [[sonnet]]). The poem in its last three lines, also bears similarities to the legend of [[Leviathan]], a sea monster, who shall rise to the surface at the [[end time|end of days]].

Tennyson's description apparently influenced [[Jules Verne]]'s imagined lair of the famous giant squid in ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' from 1870. Verne also makes numerous references to Kraken, and Bishop Pontoppidan in the novel.

Later developments of the Kraken image may be traced at [[Kraken in popular culture]].
