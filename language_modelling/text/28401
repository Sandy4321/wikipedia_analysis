==Scholarship==
Cutbirth's research examines the relationship between satire and journalism in American politics. He is working on his first book, ''Fake News, Real Politics: Jon Stewart and the New Political Press'', an extension of the doctoral work he did at [[Columbia University]] under [[Todd Gitlin]], [[James W. Carey]] and [[Herbert J. Gans]].

He has lectured on the topic and offered a course, ''Fake News, Politics and Popular Culture'', (2004<U+2013>07) at the New School and NYU. He expanded the course in 2010 to include the Anglo-Irish tradition of satire and the reciprocal comedic tradition between Canada and the United States. He renamed it ''Satire as News'', and offered it as a graduate seminar at UBC.<ref name="ubc"/>

In explaining the course to [[Fox News]] in 2007 he said, "We examine what's gone wrong in the country, not in the relationship we have with politics, but in the relationship we have with mass media."<ref>{{cite news |title=Superhero Science?
