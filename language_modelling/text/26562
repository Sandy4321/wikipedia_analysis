'''Ryan Theriot''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>t<U+025B>ri.o<U+028A>}}; born December 7, 1979 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]<ref name="mlb">"[http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=444135 Player File - Ryan Theriot]", [[Major League Baseball]].</ref>) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[infielder]] for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].<ref name="mlb" />

A [[shortstop]] in college,<ref name="lsu">"[http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=27867&SPID=2173&DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=174177&Q_SEASON=2000 Ryan Theriot Bio]", LSUSports.net, May 30, 2006.</ref> Theriot was converted to [[second base]] for his major league debut, but  played shortstop throughout the 2007-2009 seasons.<ref name="b-r">"[http://www.baseball-reference.com/t/theriry01.shtml Ryan Theriot Statistics]", Baseball-Reference.com.</ref> Theriot then was switched back to second base to make room for the rookie sensation [[Starlin Castro]], who took his spot at shortstop on May 7th, 2010. Theriot has also played [[third base]], [[right field]], and [[left field]].<ref name="b-r" />

==College career==
After an All-State career at [[Broadmoor High School]] in Baton Rouge, he played college baseball at [[Louisiana State University]], and was named to the [[College World Series]] all-tournament team in 2000.<ref name="mlb" /> On June 12, 2000, Theriot broke up a no-hitter that was being thrown by his future teammate, [[Mark Prior]], then pitching for Southern Cal.

Theriot scored the game winning run in the 2000 national championship game following a Brad Cresse single. The CWS title was the fifth for LSU in nine seasons.Ryan Theriot was named The Most Stylish Athlete. 

Ryan followed up the 2000 season with a very good 2001 campaign that resulted in a 2nd Team All-SEC selection, the first and only All-conference honor of his college career. Prior to the 2001 season, Theriot was voted team captain by his teammates.

Theriot began his career as LSU's starting second baseman in 1999. He moved to shortstop in 2000 to make way for future Cubs teammate [[Mike Fontenot]], now with the [[San Francisco Giants]].

==Chicago Cubs==
Theriot made his Major League Baseball debut on September 13, 2005, as a pinch hitter against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], and gained his first hit the following day against [[Brian Shackelford]]<ref name="2007 Guide">Ryan Theriot Bio, 2007 Chicago Cubs Media Guide, page 157.</ref>. In 2006 he split time between the [[Iowa Cubs]] and the major league team, hitting .328 in 53 games with the Chicago team<ref name="2007 Guide"/>.

In 2007, Theriot made the opening day roster as a utility player. However, the early season struggles of [[Cesar Izturis]] lead to Theriot getting more starts and quickly became the starter. Izturis was traded in July. Also in 2007, Theriot was reunited with his former collegiate teammate [[Mike Fontenot]].<ref>LSU Athletics, [http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=5200&ATCLID=923819 Theriot, Fontenot Reunite in Cubs Infield] (June 12, 2007), LSUsports.net, Retrieved on July 28, 2007.</ref> Theriot and Fontenot made up the double play combination for the 2000 National Champion LSU Tigers.

Theriot was very versatile throughout the 2007 season; playing multiple positions defensively, and hitting all over the batting order. Despite impressive numbers from Theriot in the lead-off spot, albeit a small sample size, the return of [[Alfonso Soriano]] resulted in Theriot returning to the two hole.

While not expected to hit for power, Theriot was asked to try to drive in more runs early in 2009 as the Cubs succumbed to injuries and poor performance to their big boppers including Aramis Ramirez, Alfonso Soriano, Geovany Soto, and Milton Bradley.  He quickly went on a relative tear and smacked 7 home runs, including his first two ever outside Wrigley Field, as the other players regained their health.

On May 1, [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]], Theriot hit his first career [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], against the [[Florida Marlins]].
The Cubs were down 5-2 when he hit it, and it gave them the lead. The Cubs won, 8-6.

On February 19, 2010, for the first time since 1993, the Cubs went to arbitration (with Theriot).  Theriot's figure was one year, $3.4M.  The Cubs' figure was also one year, $2.6M.  The Cubs won the case. He appeared in 96 games with the Cubs in 2010, hitting .284.

==Los Angeles Dodgers ==
On July 31, 2010, Theriot and [[Ted Lilly]] were traded to the Dodgers for [[Blake DeWitt]], [[Brett Wallach]], and [[Kyle Smit]]. <ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5426301</ref> With the Dodgers he was in 54 games and hit .242.

==Personal==
Theriot and his wife, Johnnah Haik, live in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] with son Houston, 4, and an infant daughter Macey Marie. A second daughter, Georgia Grace, was born on July 14, 2008.
He was sometimes referred to by Cubs fans and broadcasters as "The Riot" as a play on the spelling of his last name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070810/SPORTS0405/708100304/1001/SPORTS|title=Roy Lang III: North, South love Theriot, but differ on 'The Riot'|date=August 10, 2007|work=Shreveport Times|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref>
