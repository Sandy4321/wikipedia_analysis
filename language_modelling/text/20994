'''''Black Coal, Thin Ice''''' ({{zh|c=<U+767D><U+65E5><U+7130><U+706B>|p=Bai Ri Yan Huo|l=Daylight Fireworks}}) is a 2014 Chinese [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Diao Yinan]].  The film won the [[Golden Bear]] award at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=BBC/>

==Name==
The film's English title ''Black Coal, Thin Ice'' is different from its Chinese title ''Bai Ri Yan Huo'', which translates literally as ''Daylight Fireworks''. Diao Yinan came across this phrase from a friend of his.<ref>http://ent.qq.com/a/20140216/005919.htm</ref> Diao further clarified the meaning of "daylight fireworks" as a state of sentiment or a state of condition. For him, the Chinese and English names together helped to construct the difference between reality and fantasy. In an interview he explained, "Coal and ice both belong to the realm of reality, but fireworks in daylight is something fantastic; they are the two sides of the same coin." The English name refers to the two visual clues in the film: coal as "where the body parts were found" and ice as "where the murder was committed".<ref>http://cinephilia.net/archives/23991</ref> He further explained, "when the two are combined, the reality of this murder is constructed ... while daytime fireworks is a fantasy, it is what we use to coat ourselves from the cruel side of this real world."

==Plot==
The story is set in northern China in the late 1990s.<ref name=france24/>
