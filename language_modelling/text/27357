'''Solomon''', also '''Salomon''' ({{lang-hu|Salamon}}; 1053&nbsp;<U+2013> 1087) was [[King of Hungary]] from 1063. Being the elder son of [[Andrew I of Hungary]], he was crowned king in his father's lifetime in 1057 or 1058. However, he was forced to flee from Hungary after his uncle, [[B<U+00E9>la I of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la]] dethroned his father in 1060. Assisted by German troops, Solomon returned and was again crowned king in 1063. On this occasion he married [[Judith of Swabia|Judith]], who was a daughter of the late [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In the following year he reached an agreement with his cousins, the three sons of the late B<U+00E9>la I. [[G<U+00E9>za I of Hungary|G<U+00E9>za]], [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Ladislaus]] and [[Lampert of Hungary|Lampert]] acknowledged Solomon's rule, but in exchange received one-third of the kingdom as a separate [[Duchy (Kingdom of Hungary)|duchy]].

In the following years, Solomon and his cousins jointly fought against the [[Czechs]], the [[Cumans]] and other enemies of the kingdom. Their relationship deteriorated in the early 1070s and G<U+00E9>za rebelled against him. Solomon could only maintain his rule in a small zone along the western frontiers of Hungary after his defeat in the [[battle of Mogyor<U+00F3>d]] on 14 March 1074. He officially abdicated in 1081, but was arrested for conspiring against G<U+00E9>za's brother and successor, Ladislaus.

Solomon was set free during the canonization process of the first king of Hungary, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] in 1083. In an attempt to regain his crown, Solomon allied with the [[Pechenegs]], but King Ladislaus defeated their invading troops. According to a nearly contemporaneous source, Solomon died on a plundering raid in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Later legends say that he survived and died as a saintly hermit in [[Pula]] (Croatia).

==Early life==
Solomon was a son of King [[Andrew I of Hungary]] and his wife, [[Anastasia of Kiev]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|pp=69, 87}} His parents were married in about 1038.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=69}} He was born in 1053{{sfn|Makk|1994|p=77}} as his parents' second child and eldest son.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=87}}

His father had him crowned king in 1057 or 1058.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=26}} Solomon's coronation was a fundamental condition of his engagement to [[Judith of Swabia|Judith]], a sister of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], [[King of Germany]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=31}} Their engagement put an end to the more than ten-year-long period of armed conflicts between Hungary and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=87}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=60}}{{sfn|Robinson|1999|p=35}} However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, [[B<U+00E9>la I of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la]], who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of [[seniority]].{{sfn|Bartl|<U+010C>i<U+010D>aj|Koh<U+00FA>tova|Letz|2002|p=26}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Robinson|1999|p=35}} B<U+00E9>la had, since around 1048, administered the so-called ''[[Duchy (Kingdom of Hungary)|ducatus]]'' or duchy, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=30-31}}

{{Quote|''Because carnal love and ties of blood are wont to prove a hindrance to truthfulness, in King Andreas love for his son overcame justice, so that he broke the treaty of his promise, which in kings should not be; in the twelfth year of his reign, when he was worn out with age, he caused his son Salomon, who was still a child of five years, to be [[Anointing#Christian monarchy|anointed]] and crowned king over all Hungary. He pretended that he did this to prevent injury to his kingdom, for the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] would not have given his daughter to his son Salomon unless he had crowned him. When therefore they sang at Salomon's coronation: "[[Book of Genesis|Be lord over thy brethren]]," and it was told to Duke Bela by an interpreter that the infant Salomon had been made king over him, he was greatly angered.''|''[[Illuminated Chronicle|The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle]]''<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 64.91), p. 115.</ref>}}

According to the ''Illuminated Chronicle'', in order to secure Solomon's succession, his father arranged a meeting with Duke B<U+00E9>la at the royal manor in [[Tiszav<U+00E1>rkony]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=60}} The king proposed that his brother choose between a crown and a sword (which were the symbols of royal and ducal power, respectively), but had previously commanded his men to murder the duke if B<U+00E9>la picked the crown.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=60}}

Division of the war-booty caused a new conflict between Solomon and his cousin, because the king granted only a quarter of the booty to the duke, who claimed its third part.{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|pp=83-84}} Thereafter the duke negotiated with the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s envoys and set all the Byzantine captives free without the king's consent.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=91}} The conflict was further sharpened by Count Vid; the ''Illuminated Chronicle'' narrates how the count incited the young monarch against his cousins by saying that as "two sharp swords cannot be kept in the same [[scabbard]]", so the king and the duke "cannot reign together in the same kingdom".<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 78.110), p. 121.</ref> {{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p=84}}

Having been liberated, Solomon first visited his wife in [[Regensburg]], "although she was not grateful for this",<ref>''Bernold of St Blasien, Chronicle'' (year 1084), p. 273.</ref> according to the nearly contemporaneous [[Bernold of St Blasien]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=95}} From Germany, Solomon fled to the "Cumans"{{mdash}}in fact Pechenegs, according to the historians Gyula Krist<U+00F3> and P<U+00E1>l Engel{{mdash}}who were dwelling in the regions east of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] and north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=95}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=33}} Solomon promised one of their chiefs, Kutesk, that "he would give him the right of possession over the province of Transylvania and would take his daughter as wife"<ref name="Chronicon_95.134_128"/> if Kutesk and his people would help him to regain his throne.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=95}}{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p=94}} They invaded the regions along the Upper Tisza "with a great multitude"<ref name="Chronicon_95.134_128"/> of the "Cumans", but King Ladislaus routed and forced them to withdraw from Hungary.{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p=94}}{{sfn|<U+00C9>rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=93}}

At the head of "a large contingent of Dacians"<ref>''Anna Comnena: The Alexiad'' (7.1.), p. 217.</ref> (Hungarians), Solomon joined a huge army of Cumans and Pechenegs who invaded the Byzantine Empire in 1087.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=300}} The Byzantines routed the invaders in the mountains of [[Bulgaria (theme)|Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=300}} Solomon seems to have died fighting in the battlefield, because Bernold of St. Blasien narrates that he "died courageously after an incredible slaughter of the enemy after he bravely undertook an enterprise against the King of the Greeks" in 1087.<ref>''Bernold of St Blasien, Chronicle'' (year 1087), p. 290.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|pp=95-96}}

Reports of later sources prove that Solomon became the subject of popular legends.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=148}} For instance, the ''Illuminated Chronicle'' writes that Solomon "repented of his sins, so far as human understanding may reach" after the battle, and passed the last years of his life "in pilgrimage and prayer, in fastings and watchings, in labour and contrition".<ref>''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 96.136), p. 129.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|pp=95-96}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=148}} According to these sources, Solomon died in [[Pula]] on the [[Istrian Peninsula]]{{sfn|Kosztolnyik|1981|p=94}} where he was venerated as a saint.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=97}} However, he was never officially canonized.{{sfn|Klaniczay|2002|p=148}} His alleged tombstone is now in a local museum.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=97}}

{{Quote|[Solomon] ''was now completely at a loss, and after returning to his queen at [[Admont Abbey|Admont]] he spent a few days with her before returning to [[Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r]] in monk's habit. There, the story goes, his brother'' (sic) ''Ladislas was distributing alms to the poor with his own hands on the porch of the church of the Blessed Virgin, and Solomon was among the recipients. When Ladislas looked closely he realised who it was. After the distribution was over Ladislas made careful inquiries. He intended Solomon no harm, but Solomon assumed he did, and quit Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r, making for the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. There he passed the rest of his days in complete poverty in a city named Pula; he died in destitution and was buried there, never having returned to his wife.

Solomon's wife, [[Judith of Swabia|Judith]], who was born in 1048, was the third daughter of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his second wife, [[Agnes de Poitou]].{{sfn|Robinson|1999|p=19}} Their wedding took place in Sz<U+00E9>kesfeh<U+00E9>rv<U+00E1>r in June 1063.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=87}} The marriage remained childless.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=96}} They first separated from each other around 1075.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=94}} According to Bernold of St Blasien, neither Solomon nor his wife had "kept the marriage contract: on the contrary, they had not been afraid, in opposition to the [[Paul the Apostle|apostle]], to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|defraud each other]]."<ref>''Bernold of St Blasien, Chronicle'' (year 1084), p. 274.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=95}} Having been informed on Solomon's death, Judith married Duke [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I Herman]] of Poland in 1088.{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=96}} In contrast with all contemporaneous sources, the late 13th-century Simon of K<U+00E9>za writes that Judith "spurned all suitors" after her husband's death, although "many princes in Germany sought her hand".<ref>''Simon of K<U+00E9>za: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 2.61), p. 137.</ref>{{sfn|Krist<U+00F3>|Makk|1996|p=96}}
