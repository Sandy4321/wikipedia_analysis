The company has its roots in 1978 when three friends, [[Josep Maria Llad<U+00F3> Costa|Josep Maria Llad<U+00F3>]], aeronautical engineer and balloonist, [[Joan Comellas]] and [[Jaume Llansana]],<ref name="fund">[http://www.viasfera.org/?viatges-cultura&f=368&%C3%80frica <U+00C1>frica en globo. Persiguiendo a Julio Verne] {{ca}}</ref> started to fly with a second-hand hot air balloon, and soon after decided to build a bigger balloon, named "Tramuntana",<ref name="tramuntana">Infonomia, [http://www.infonomia.com/blog/perm.php?id=2006 Ultramagic, por Ramon Bori (19/11/2003)] {{es}}</ref> for a long journey in [[Africa]], because they had not enough money to purchase an already manufactured balloon.<ref name="entrev" /> This journey took place 1980, lasting 11 months, with 40 balloon flights starting from [[Zanzibar]], going to [[Tanzania]], [[Ruanda]] and part of [[Zaire]] to finalize in [[Kisangani]], current [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. After that, they started to design an [[ultralight]] aircraft and created the company '''Ultramagic SA''', together with [[Carles Llad<U+00F3>]], brother of Josep Maria. Ultramagic Ultralights evolved to Ultramagic Balloons, because after building an ultralight prototype they saw it was complex, required lot of funds, lot of components had to be imported, and serial production was required to be profitable.<ref name="entrev">Avui, [http://paper.avui.cat/dialeg/detail.php?id=147176 Entrevista amb Josep M. Llad<U+00F3>, Enginyer aeron<U+00E0>utic, copropietari de Globus Ultram<U+00E0>gic] {{ca}}</ref> On top of that, they had experience manufacturing balloons and they still had the sewing machines and an aeronautic background.<ref name="hist">[http://www.ultramagic.com/balloons/Ultramagic-----s33_105.html History: More than 30 years experience in Balloons.]</ref> 

The company launched in 1993 a cold air [[inflatables]] division, with 4.000 units manufactured until today. Production of inflatables is around 500 units per year.<ref name="hist"/>

In 2006 Ultramagic sold a massive N-355 balloon to [[Virgin Balloon Flights]], the UK<U+2019>s largest passenger carrying balloon company. This new balloon, that takes a {{convert|355000|cuft|m3|abbr=on}} of air and can carry a basket with up to 16 passengers, replaced a smaller Cameron 340 balloon.<ref name="virgin">Virgin Balloon Flights, [http://www.virginballoonflights.co.uk/press13.asp Virgin Inflates fleet with Monster New Balloon]</ref>

In year 2009 Ultramagic made the first official flight of the "''Ecomagic''", an [[eco-friendly]] hot air balloon, with a reduced consumption, developed together with the School of Aeronautic Engineering of the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. The textile fabric used by this balloon has a double layer to better isolate the hot air, thus reducing consumption and allowing longer flights. The Ecomagic consumption is less than 50% of a standard balloon, and can even reach a 30%.<ref name="a2009">Avui, [http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/07/ultramagic_dissenya_un_globus_aerostatic_sostenible_que_consumeix_la_meitat_d_energia_65058.php Ultramagic dissenya un globus aerost<U+00E0>tic sostenible que consumeix la meitat d'energia] {{ca}}</ref>
