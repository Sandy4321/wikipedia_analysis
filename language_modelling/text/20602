'''Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''' (31 August AD 12 <U+2013> 24 January AD 41), commonly known as '''Caligula''' and sometimes '''Gaius''', was [[Roman Emperor]] from 37 to 41. Caligula was a member of the house of rulers conventionally known as the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Caligula's father [[Germanicus]], the nephew and [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] son of emperor [[Tiberius]], was a very successful general and one of Rome's most beloved public figures. The young Gaius earned the nickname Caligula (the diminutive form of ''[[Caligae|caliga]]'' meaning "little soldier's boot") from his father's soldiers while accompanying him during his campaigns in [[Germania]]. When Germanicus died at [[Antioch]] in 19 AD, his mother [[Agrippina the Elder]] returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in an increasingly bitter feud with Tiberius. This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. Unscathed by the deadly intrigues, Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of [[Capri]] in 31, where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier. At the death of Tiberius in 37, Caligula succeeded his great-uncle and adoptive grandfather.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign, although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane [[tyrant]]. While the reliability of these sources has been questioned, what is known is that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the authority of the emperor. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and notoriously luxurious dwellings for himself. However, he initiated the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the [[Aqua Claudia]] and the [[Anio Novus]]. During his reign, the empire annexed the [[Mauretania|Kingdom of Mauretania]] and made it into a [[Roman Mauretania|province]].

In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the [[Praetorian Guard]], as well as members of the [[Roman Senate]] and of the imperial court. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the [[Roman Republic]] was thwarted, as the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle [[Claudius]] emperor in his place.

As a boy of just two or three, Gaius accompanied his father, [[Germanicus]], on campaigns in the north of [[Germania]].<ref name="suetonius-calig-9">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#9 9].</ref> The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier's uniform, including boots and armor.<ref name="suetonius-calig-9"/> He was soon given his nickname ''Caligula'', meaning "little (soldier's) boot" in Latin, after the small boots he wore as part of his uniform.<ref name="caligula-name">"Caligula" is formed from the Latin word ''caliga'', meaning soldier's boot, and the [[diminutive]] [[infix]] ''-ul''.</ref> Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname.<ref name="seneca-calig-18">Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of a Wise Person'' XVIII 2<U+2013>5.

==Emperor==
===Early reign===
When Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, his estate and the titles of the [[Principate]] were left to Caligula and Tiberius' own grandson, [[Tiberius Gemellus|Gemellus]], who were to serve as joint heirs. Despite Tiberius being 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still suppose he was murdered.<ref name="suetonius-calig-12"/><ref name="tacitus-calig-50">Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]].</ref> [[Tacitus]] writes that the Praetorian Prefect, [[Naevius Sutorius Macro|Macro]], smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to the joy of the Roman people,<ref name="tacitus-calig-50"/> while [[Suetonius]] writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing, though this is not recorded by any other ancient historian.<ref name="suetonius-calig-12"/> [[Philo]], a contemporary of Tiberius' reign, and [[Josephus]], record Tiberius dying a natural death.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#IV|IV.25]]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIII.6.9.</ref> Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius' will nullified with regards to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius' wishes.<ref name="cassius-history-59-1">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#1 LIX.1].</ref>
[[File:Eustache Caligula.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Caligula Depositing the Ashes of his Mother and Brother in the Tomb of his Ancestors'', by [[Eustache Le Sueur]], 1647]]

Caligula accepted the powers of the Principate as conferred by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] and entered Rome on 28 March amid a crowd that hailed him as "our baby" and "our star," among other nicknames.<ref name="suetonius-calig-13">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#13 13].</ref> Caligula is described as the first emperor who was admired by everyone in "all the world, from the rising to the setting sun."<ref name="philo-gaius-2-10">Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.10]].</ref> Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular [[Germanicus]],<ref name="suetonius-calig-13" /> but also because he was not [[Tiberius]].<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Tiberius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#75 75].</ref> It was also said by Suetonius that over 160,000 animals were sacrificed during three months of public rejoicing to usher in his reign.<ref name="suetonius-calig-14">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#14 14].</ref><ref name="philo-gaius-2-11">Philo mentions widespread sacrifice, but no estimation on the degree, Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.12]].</ref> Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula's reign as completely blissful.<ref name="philo-gaius-2-13">Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#II|II.13]].</ref>

Caligula's first acts were said to be generous in spirit, though many were political in nature.<ref name="cassius-history-59-1" /> To gain support, he granted bonuses to those in the military including the [[Praetorian Guard]], city troops and the army outside of Italy.<ref name="cassius-history-59-1" /> He destroyed Tiberius' treason papers, declared that [[treason]] trials were a thing of the past and recalled exiles.<ref name="suetonius-calig-15">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#15 15].</ref> He helped those who had been harmed by the Imperial [[tax]] system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, such as gladiator battles.<ref name="suetonius-calig-16">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16 16].</ref><ref name="suetonius-calig-18">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#18 18].</ref> Caligula also collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.3.</ref> He had his cousin and adopted son [[Tiberius Gemellus]] executed-an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus mutual grandmother [[Antonia Minor]]. She is said to have committed suicide-although Seutonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He also had his father in law [[Marcus Silanus]] and his brother-in-law [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]] executed as well. His uncle [[Claudius]] was spared only because Caligula kept him as a laughing stock. Of his three sisters, his favorite [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] died in AD 38 of a fever while [[Livilla (sister of Caligula)|Livilla]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]] were exiled. He hated the fact that his grandfather was [[Agrippa]] and instead slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter [[Julia the Elder]].<ref>[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#23 23]</ref>

===Public reform===
[[File:RIC 0039.jpg|right|thumb|[[Quadrans|Quadran]] celebrating the abolition of a tax in AD 38 by Caligula. The obverse of the coin contains a picture of the liberty cap which symbolizes the liberation of the people from the tax burden.]]

In AD 38, Caligula focused his attention on political and public reform. He published the accounts of public funds, which had not been made public during the reign of Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes, and gave out prizes to the public at gymnastic events. He also allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders.<ref name="cassius-history-59-9-and-10">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9 LIX.9<U+2013>10].</ref>

Perhaps most significantly, he restored the practice of democratic elections.<ref name="seutonius-calig-16-2">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#16.2 16.2].</ref> [[Cassius Dio]] said that this act "though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many ... many disasters would result".<ref name="cassius-history-59-9-7">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#9.7 LIX.9.7].</ref>

During the same year, though, Caligula also was criticized for executing people without full trials and for forcing his helper Macro to commit suicide.<ref name="cassius-history-59-10">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#10 LIX.10].</ref>

===Financial crisis and famine===
According to [[Cassius Dio]], a financial crisis emerged in AD 39.<ref name="cassius-history-59-10" /> [[Suetonius]] places the beginning of this crisis in 38.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37].</ref> Caligula's political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state's treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.<ref name="seutonius-calig-38">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#38 38].</ref> A number of other desperate measures by Caligula are described by historians. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money.<ref name = "gjxxsj">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#41 41].</ref> Caligula levied taxes on lawsuits, marriage and prostitution.<ref name="suetonius-calig-40">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#40 40].</ref> Caligula began auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows.<ref name="seutonius-calig-38" /><ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14].</ref> Wills that left items to Tiberius were interpreted now to leave the items to Caligula.<ref name="cassius-history-59-15">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#15 LIX.15].</ref> Centurions who had acquired property during plundering were forced to turn over spoils to the state.<ref name="cassius-history-59-15" /> The current and past highway commissioners were accused of incompetence and embezzlement and forced to repay money.<ref name="cassius-history-59-15" /> According to Seutonius within a year of his reign he had squandered 2,700,000,000 [[sesterces]] Tiberius had amassed.<ref>[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#37 37]</ref> His nephew [[Nero Caesar]] both envied and admired the fact that Gaius had run through the vast wealth Tiberius had left him in so short a time.<ref>[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Nero [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#30 30]</ref>

[[File:vatican obelisk.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was first brought from Egypt to Rome by Caligula. It was the centerpiece of a large racetrack he built.]]
A brief famine of an unknown size occurred, perhaps caused by this financial crisis, according to Suetonius due to public carriages being seized by Caligula,<ref name="seutonius-calig-38" /> according to Seneca because grain imports were disturbed by Caligula using boats for a pontoon bridge.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' XVIII.5.</ref>

===Construction===
Despite financial difficulties, Caligula embarked on a number of construction projects during his reign. Some were for the public good, while others were for himself.

[[Josephus]] describes as Caligula's greatest contribution to have improved the harbours at [[Rhegium]] and [[Sicily]], thereby allowing grain imports from Egypt to increase.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.5]].</ref> These improvements may have been made in response to the famine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary [[Pontoon bridge|floating bridge]] to be built using ships as [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]], stretching for over two miles from the resort of [[Baiae]] to the neighboring port of [[Puteoli]].<ref name="seutonius-calig-19">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#19 19].</ref> It was said that the bridge was to rival that of Persian King Xerxes' crossing of the Hellespont.<ref name="seutonius-calig-19" /> Caligula, a man who could not swim,<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#54 54].</ref> then proceeded to ride his favorite horse, [[Incitatus]], across, wearing the breastplate of [[Alexander the Great#Fate after death|Alexander the Great]].<ref name="seutonius-calig-19" /> This act was in defiance of a prediction by Tiberius' soothsayer [[Thrasyllus of Mendes]] that Caligula had "no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae".<ref name="seutonius-calig-19" />

Caligula also had [[Nemi ships|two large ships]] constructed for himself, which were found at the bottom of [[Lake Nemi]] during the dictatorship of Mussolini. The ships are among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace that counted marble floors and plumbing among its amenities. Fifteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the [[Second World War]], and almost nothing remains of the hulls, though many archeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi.

===Feud with the Senate===
In AD 39, relations between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated.<ref name="treason-trials">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.16; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 30.</ref> On what they disagreed is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. Prior to Caligula's appointment, the Roman Senate was accustomed to ruling without an emperor in Rome since [[Tiberius]]' departure for Capri in 26.<ref name="Tacitus, Annals IV.41">Tacitus, ''Annals'' IV.41.</ref> Additionally, Tiberius' treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as [[Gaius Asinius Gallus|Gallus Asinius]].<ref name="Tacitus, Annals IV.41"/>

Caligula reviewed Tiberius' records of treason trials and decided that numerous senators, based on their actions during these trials, were not trustworthy.<ref name="treason-trials"/> He ordered a new set of investigations and trials.<ref name="treason-trials"/> He replaced the consul and had several senators put to death.<ref name="suetonius-caligula-26">Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 26.</ref> [[Suetonius]] reports that other senators were degraded by being forced to wait on him and run beside his chariot.<ref name="suetonius-caligula-26"/>

Soon after his break with the Senate, Caligula was met with a number of additional conspiracies against him.<ref name="dio-caligula-22">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.22.</ref> A conspiracy involving [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|his brother-in-law]] was foiled in late 39.<ref name="dio-caligula-22"/> Soon after, the governor of Germany, [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus]], was executed for connections to a conspiracy.<ref name="dio-caligula-22"/>

===Western expansion===
In AD 40, Caligula expanded the Roman Empire into [[Mauretania]] and made a significant attempt at expanding into [[Britannia]] <U+2013> even challenging [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] in his campaign. The conquest of Britannia was fully realized by his successors.

Mauretania was a [[client kingdom]] of Rome ruled by [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]]. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then had him suddenly executed.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#35 35].</ref> Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and divided into two provinces.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' V.2.</ref> This annexation of Mauretania led to a rebellion of some magnitude that was put down under [[Claudius]].<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#8 LX.8], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#24 LX.24]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' V.11.</ref> Details on these events are unclear. [[Cassius Dio]] had written an entire chapter on the annexation of Mauretania by Caligula, but it is now lost.<ref name="cassius-history-59-25">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#25 LIX.25].</ref>

There also seemed to be a northern campaign to Britannia that was aborted.<ref name="cassius-history-59-25" /> This campaign is derided by ancient historians with accounts of [[Gaul]]s dressed up as Germanic tribesmen at his triumph and Roman troops ordered to collect seashells as "spoils of the sea".<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#45 45<U+2013>47].</ref> Due to the lack of sources, what precisely occurred and why is a matter of debate even among the primary sources for Caligula's reign. Modern historians have put forward numerous theories in an attempt to explain these actions. This trip to the [[English Channel]] could have merely been a training and scouting mission.<ref>P. Bicknell, "The Emperor Gaius' Military Activities in AD 40", ''Historia'' 17 (1968), 496<U+2013>505.</ref> The mission may have been to accept the surrender of the British chieftain [[Adminius]].<ref>R.W. Davies, "The Abortive Invasion of Britain by Gaius", ''Historia'' 15 (1966), 124<U+2013>128; S.J.V.Malloch, 'Gaius on the Channel Coast', Classical Quarterly 51 (2001) 551-56; See Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#44 44].</ref> "Seashells", or ''conchae'' in Latin, may be a metaphor for something else such as female genitalia (perhaps the troops visited brothels) or boats (perhaps they captured several small British boats).<ref>D. Wardle, ''Suetonius' Life of Caligula: a Commentary'' (Brussels, 1994), 313; David Woods "Caligula's Seashells", ''Greece and Rome'' (2000), 80<U+2013>87.</ref>

===Claims of divinity===
[[File:RomaForoRomanoTempioCastori.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruins of the temple of Castor and Pollux in the [[Forum Romanum]]. Ancient resources as well as recent archaeological evidence suggest that, at one point, Caligula had the palace extended to annex this structure.]]When several kings came to Rome to pay their respects to him and argued about their nobility of descent, he cried out "Let there be one Lord, one King".<ref>[''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#22 22]</ref> In AD 40, Caligula began implementing very controversial policies that introduced religion into his political role. Caligula began appearing in public dressed as various gods and demigods such as [[Hercules]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Apollo]].<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XI|XI-XV]].</ref> Reportedly, he began referring to himself as a god when meeting with politicians and he was referred to as Jupiter on occasion in public documents.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26].</ref><ref name="cassius-history-59-28">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28].</ref> A sacred precinct was set apart for his worship at Miletus in the province of Asia and two temples were erected for worship of him in Rome.<ref name="cassius-history-59-28" /> The [[Temple of Castor and Pollux]] on the Forum was linked directly to the Imperial residence on the Palatine and dedicated to Caligula.<ref name="cassius-history-59-28" /><ref>Sanford, J.: "[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/10%20september/caligula-910.html Did Caligula have a God complex?], ''Stanford Report'', 10 September 2003.{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> He would appear here on occasion and present himself as a god to the public.

ISBN 0739420259.</ref>

Caligula's religious policy was a departure from that of his predecessors. According to [[Cassius Dio]], living Emperors could be worshipped as divine in the east and dead Emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome.<ref name="dio-51">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LI.20.</ref> [[Augustus]] also had the public [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|worship his spirit]] on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from.<ref name="dio-51"/> Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including Senators, worship him as a physical living god.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#26 LIX.26<U+2013>28].</ref>

===Eastern policy===
Caligula needed to quell several riots and conspiracies in the eastern territories during his reign. Aiding him in his actions was his good friend, [[Herod Agrippa]], who became governor of the territories of Batanaea and Trachonitis after Caligula became emperor in AD 37.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 6|XVIII.6.10]]; Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#V|V.25]].</ref>

The cause of tensions in the east was complicated, involving the spread of Greek culture, Roman law and the rights of Jews.

Caligula did not trust the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' III.8, IV.21.</ref> In 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.26<U+2013>28.</ref> According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' V.29.</ref> Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish [[synagogue]]s.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus VI|VI.43]].</ref> As a result, riots broke out in the city.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#VII|VII.45]].</ref> Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''Flaccus'' [[s:Flaccus#XXI|XXI.185]].</ref>

In 39, Agrippa accused [[Herod Antipas]], the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and [[Perea (Holy Land)|Perea]], of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of [[Parthia]]. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was awarded with his territories.<ref name="josephus-antiquities-18-7-2">Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 7|XVIII.7.2]].</ref>

Riots again erupted in Alexandria in AD 40 between Jews and Greeks.<ref name = "zepjql">Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 8|XVIII.8.1]].</ref> Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor.<ref name = "zepjql"/> Also, disputes occurred in the city of Jamnia.<ref name="philo-gaius-30">Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.201]].</ref> Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it.<ref name="philo-gaius-30" /> In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish [[Temple of Jerusalem]],<ref name="philo-gaius-statue">Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXX|XXX.203]].</ref> a demand in conflict with Jewish monotheism.<ref name="philo-caligula-16">Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XVI|XVI.115]].</ref> In this context, [[Philo]] wrote that Caligula "regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his".<ref name="philo-caligula-16"/>

Fearing civil war if the order were carried out, it was delayed for nearly a year by the [[Roman Governor|governor]] of Syria, Publius Petronius.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' [[s:On the Embassy to Gaius#XXXI|XXXI.213]].</ref> Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order.<ref name = "zepjql"/>

[[File:Caligula RIC 0033.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[sestertius]] depicting Caligula, ''c.'' AD 38. The reverse shows Caligula's three sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla and Julia Livilla, with whom Caligula was rumoured to have carried on incestuous relationships.]]

===Scandals===
[[File:KunsthistorischesMuseumCameeCaligula.jpg|thumb|Cameo depicting Caligula and a personification of Rome]]
Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity.

The contemporary sources, [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Seneca the Younger]], describe an insane emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and who indulged in too much spending and sex.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' xviii.1, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1; ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5; Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XXIX.</ref> He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.1.</ref> killing for mere amusement,<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' III.xviii.1.</ref> purposely wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Shortness of Life'' xviii.5.</ref> and wanting a statue of himself erected in the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] for his worship.<ref name="philo-gaius-statue"/> Once at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his guards to throw an entire section of the crowd into the arena during intermission to be eaten by animals because there were no criminals to be prosecuted and he was bored.<ref>"Daily life in the Roman City". Aldrete, Gregory.</ref>

While repeating the earlier stories, the later sources of [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] add additional tales of insanity. They accuse Caligula of [[incest]] with his sisters, [[Agrippina the Younger]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]] and [[Julia Livilla|Livilla]], and say he prostituted them to other men.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#11 LIX.11], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#22 LIX.22]; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#24 24].</ref> They state he sent troops on illogical military exercises,<ref name="cassius-history-59-25" /><ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#46 46<U+2013>47].</ref> turned the palace into a brothel,<ref name = "gjxxsj"/> and most famously, tried to make his horse, [[Incitatus]], a consul and a priest.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 55; Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#14 LIX.14], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#28 LIX.28].</ref>

The validity of these accounts is debatable. In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.<ref>{{cite book |last=Younger |first=John G. |title=Sex in the Ancient World from A to Z |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415242525|pages=xvi |nopp=true}}</ref>

===Assassination and aftermath===
[[File:Cor-aabr001903.jpg|upright|thumb|Renaissance picture of Caligula]]
Caligula's actions as emperor were described as being especially harsh to the Senate, the nobility and the equestrian order.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.1.</ref> According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] against Caligula.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56]; Tacitus, ''Annals'' 16.17; Josephus, ''Antiquities of Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.2]].</ref> Eventually, a successful murder was planned by officers within the [[Praetorian Guard]] led by [[Cassius Chaerea]].<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.3]].</ref> The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the Senate, army and equestrian order were said to have been informed of it and involved in it.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.10]], [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].</ref>

According to Josephus, Chaerea had political motivations for the assassination.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.6]].</ref> Suetonius sees the motive in Caligula calling Chaerea derogatory names.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].</ref> Caligula considered Chaerea effeminate because of a weak voice and for not being firm with tax collection.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.5]].</ref> Caligula would mock Chaerea with watchwords like "[[Priapus]]" and "[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]".<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#56 56].</ref>

On 24 January 41, Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula while he was addressing an acting troupe of young men during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].</ref> Details on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea was first to stab Caligula followed by a number of conspirators.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On Firmness'' xviii.2; Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58]; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.14]].</ref> Suetonius records that Caligula's death was similar to that of [[Julius Caesar]]. He states that both the elder Gaius Julius Caesar (Julius Caesar) and the younger Gaius Julius Caesar (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius ([[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]] and Cassius Chaerea).<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#57 57], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].</ref> The [[cryptoporticus]] (underground corridor) where this event would have taken place was discovered beneath the imperial palaces on the Palatine Hill.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4962109.ece Archaeologists unearth place where Emperor Caligula met his end] by Richard Owen, October 17, 2008. Retrieved 2010-03-05.</ref> By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 1|XIX.1.15]]; Suetonius, Life of Caligula [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#58 58].</ref>

The Senate attempted to use Caligula's death as an opportunity to restore the Republic.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2]].</ref> Chaerea attempted to convince the military to support the Senate.<ref name="josephus-antiquities-19-4-4">Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 4|XIX.4.4]].</ref> The military, though, remained loyal to the office of the emperor.<ref name="josephus-antiquities-19-4-4" /> The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' XI.1; Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 1|XIX.1.20]].</ref> Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, [[Caesonia]], and killed their young daughter, [[Julia Drusilla]], by smashing her head against a wall.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 59.</ref> They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, [[Claudius]], who was spirited out of the city to a nearby Praetorian camp.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 2|XIX.2.1]].</ref> Claudius became emperor after procuring the support of the Praetorian guard and ordered the execution of Chaerea and any other known conspirators involved in the death of Caligula.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' [[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XIX#Chapter 3|XIX.3.1]].</ref> According to Suetonius, Caligula's body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters. He was buried within the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]]; in 410 during the [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] the tomb's ashes were scattered.

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
The history of Caligula's reign is extremely problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived <U+2014> the works of [[Philo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Philo's works, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' and ''Flaccus'', give some details on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' LIX.19.</ref>

At one time, there were detailed contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1.</ref> Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. [[Fabius Rusticus]] and [[Cluvius Rufus]] both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus was a friend of Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation.<ref>Tacitus, ''Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola'' X, ''Annals'' XIII.20.</ref> Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' XIX.1.13.</ref> Caligula's sister, [[Agrippina the Younger]], wrote an autobiography that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula's reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Lepidus]], who conspired against Caligula.<ref name="dio-caligula-22" /> The inheritance of [[Nero]], Agrippina's son and the future emperor, was seized by Caligula. [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus|Gaetulicus]], a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.

The bulk of what is known of Caligula comes from [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]]. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Though Cassius Dio's work is invaluable because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula's reign, his surviving work is only a summary written by [[John Xiphilinus]], an 11th century monk.

A handful of other sources also add a limited perspective on Caligula. [[Josephus]] gives a detailed description of Caligula's assassination. [[Tacitus]] provides some information on Caligula's life under [[Tiberius]]. In a now lost portion of his ''Annals'', Tacitus gave a detailed history of Caligula. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Natural History'' also has a few brief references to Caligula.

There are few surviving sources on Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. The paucity of sources has resulted in significant gaps in the reign of Caligula. Little is written on the first two years of Caligula's reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of [[Mauretania]], Caligula's military actions in [[Britannia]], and his feud with the [[Roman Senate]].

===Health===
All surviving sources, except [[Pliny the Elder]], characterize Caligula as insane. However it is not known whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for Caligula's behavior, citing as possibilities [[encephalitis]], [[epilepsy]] or [[meningitis]]. The question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered.

[[Philo of Alexandria]], [[Josephus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] also state Caligula was insane, but describe this madness as a personality trait that came through experience.<ref name="josephus-antiquities-18-7-2" /><ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' XIII.</ref><ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVIII.1; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.</ref> Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from.<ref>Seneca the Younger, ''On the Firmness of the Wise Person'' XVII-XVIII; Seneca the Younger, ''On Anger'' I.xx.8.</ref> According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to think he was a god.<ref name="josephus-antiquities-18-7-2" /> [[Philo of Alexandria]] reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of his illness in 39.<ref>Philo of Alexandria, ''On the Embassy to Gaius'' III-IV.</ref> [[Juvenal]] reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.

[[Suetonius]] said that Caligula suffered from "falling sickness", or [[epilepsy]], when he was young.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Caligula 50.</ref> Modern historians have theorized that Caligula lived with a daily fear of seizures.<ref>D. Thomas Benediktson, "Caligula's Phobias and Philias: Fear of Seizure?", ''The Classical Journal'' (1991) pp. 159<U+2013>163.</ref> Despite swimming being a part of imperial education, Caligula could not swim.<ref>Suetonius, ''The Lives of Twelve Caesars'', Life of Augustus 64, Life of Caligula 54.</ref> Epileptics are encouraged not to swim because light reflecting off water can induce seizures.<ref>J.H.

Temkin, ''The Falling Sickness'' (2nd ed., Baltimore 1971) 3<U+2013>4, 7, 13, 16, 26, 86, 92<U+2013>96, 179.</ref>

Some modern historians think that Caligula suffered from [[hyperthyroidism]].<ref>R.S. Katz, "The Illness of Caligula" CW 65(1972),223-25, refuted by M.G. Morgan, "Caligula's Illness Again", CW 66(1973), 327<U+2013>29.</ref> This diagnosis is mainly attributed to Caligula's irritability and his "stare" as described by Pliny the Elder.

A recent study of Caligula's life has argued that his illness may have been an indication of [[lead poisoning]]. The Romans believed that pure wine could only be brewed in lead bowls, and Caligula's drinking was reputed to be excessive. A contemporaneous bowl artifact was tested and revealed high amounts of lead.<ref>[http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/ancients-behaving-badly/EP01191561 Ancients Behaving Badly].

==In popular culture==
''Caligula'', by French author [[Albert Camus]], is a play in which Caligula returns after deserting the palace for three days and three nights following the death of his beloved sister, Drusilla. The young emperor then uses his unfettered power to 'bring the impossible into the realm of the likely'.

In the novel ''[[I, Claudius]]'' by English writer [[Robert Graves]], Caligula is presented as being a murderous sociopath from his childhood, who became clinically insane early in his reign. At the age of only seven, he drove his father [[Germanicus]] to despair and death by secretly terrorizing him. Graves's Caligula also commits incest with all three of his sisters and is implied to have murdered Drusilla.

American actor [[Jay Robinson]] famously portrayed a sinister and scene-stealing Caligula in two epic films of the 1950s, ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953) and its sequel ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' (1954).

Caligula also has been played by [[Ralph Bates]] in the 1968 [[ITV]] television series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]''; [[John Hurt]] in the 1976 [[BBC]] television series ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]''; [[John McEnery]] in the 1985 miniseries ''A.D.''; Szabolcs Hajdu in the 1996 film ''Caligula''; and [[John Simm]] in the 2004 miniseries ''Imperium Nerone''. In [[Muriel Spark]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Takeover (novel)|The Takeover]]'' the eccentric Hubert Mallindaine believes himself to be a direct descendant of Caligula.

A feature-length historical film ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'' was completed in [[1979 in film|1979]], in which [[Malcolm McDowell]] played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with extremely explicit sex and violence and received extremely negative reviews.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:7895~T1 Caligula > Overview <U+2013> AllMovie.com]. Retrieved 2010-03-05.</ref> [[Emlyn Williams]] was cast as Caligula in the never-completed 1937 film ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', and [[Courtney Love]] appeared as Caligula in a fake trailer for ''Gore Vidal's Caligula'', ostensibly a remake of the 1979 film, but actually a parodic short film by conceptual artist Francesco Vezzoli.<ref name=test>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/arts/design/26yabl.html?ex=1298610000&en=d05471946d7b6eb0&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss, 'Caligula' Gives a Toga Party (but No One's Really Invited)].</ref>

The play ''The Reckoning of Kit and Little Boots'' by Nat Cassidy, examines the lives of the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]] and Caligula, with the fictional conceit that Marlowe was working on a play about Caligula around the time of his own murder. It emphasizes the similarities between the two characters<U+2014>both stabbed to death at 29, both in part as a result to their controversial perspectives on religion. The play also focuses on Caligula's love for his sister Drusilla, and his deep-rooted loathing for Tiberius. It received its world premiere in New York City in June 2008.<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/nycguide/451942,8.html]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytheatrecast.com/wordpress/archives/98 nytheatrecast <U+00BB> Blog Archive <U+00BB> Episode #223 <U+2013> The Reckoning of Kit & Boots and Hope<U+2019>s Arbor<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}.</ref>

In [[Melissa de la Cruz]]'s series ''Blue Bloods'', Caligula is the vampire reincarnation of [[Lucifer]], the Prince of Heaven, who later became [[Satan]] in the fall from Paradise.

In Alan Moore's [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Black Dossier]] Caligula is referred to by the character Orlando, as being violent, voluptous but undeniably sane.

In a song by [[the Smiths]] entitled "[[Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now]]", lead singer [[Morrissey]] sings, "What she asked of me at the end of the day, Caligula would have blushed."

Another song, "Caligulove" by [[Them Crooked Vultures]], uses the term 'Caligulove' as a metaphor for sex; the lyrics ask a woman the writer is infatuated with to "caligulove" him.
