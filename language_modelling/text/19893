'''Richard Anthony Lee''' (born [[5 October]] [[1982]] in [[Oxford]]) is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]]. He is a [[goalkeeper]] and currently plays for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. 

Lee came through Watford's academy, and became second choice goalkeeper after [[Ray Lewington]]'s appointment as manager at the beginning of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03]] season. He made his debut in February 2003 against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], after first choice [[Alec Chamberlain]] was rested before an [[FA Cup]] quarter final. He went on to make four more appearances that season.

At the beginning of the [[2003-04 in English football|2003&ndash;04]] season it seemed like Lee may become Watford's first-choice goalkeeper, after he started many of the club's pre-season games. However, in a pre-season fixture against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] he broke his arm, and was out injured for a period of months. By the time of his return, loanee [[Lenny Pidgeley]] had established himself in the side, with Chamberlain as his deputy. 

For the [[2004-05 in English football|2004&ndash;05]] season Lee became Watford's first-choice goalkeeper, although he was injured for Watford's League Cup semi-final against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. 

Watford manager Adrian Boothroyd's decision to loan Lee to [[Blackburn Rovers]] for the [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06]] season was met with questions from many fans. Lee spent the season as third choice goalkeeper behind [[Brad Friedel]] and [[Peter Enckelman]]. Lee returned to Watford following the conclusion of the loan deal, with both clubs unable to agree upon a transfer fee.

On his return to Watford, Lee spent most of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006&ndash;07]] [[Premier League|Premiership]] season as backup to on loan goalkeeper [[Ben Foster (footballer)|Ben Foster]], though he played in the [[FA Cup]] semi final against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as Foster was ineligible to play against his parent club.  

At the beginning of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007&ndash;08]] season, Lee again found himself as backup as during the close season [[Mart Poom]] had been signed from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Lee was eventually given his chance in the first team and managed to dislodge Poom and establish himself as Watford's first choice keeper. He was also given the responsibility of captaining the side for a time.

On [[31 August]] [[2006]], Lee appeared on the [[BBC]] programme [[Dragons' Den]], where he and a partner managed to sell 50% of the equity in their company "Dr. Cap" to the entrepreneur [[Duncan Bannatyne]] for an investment of <U+00A3>150,000.
