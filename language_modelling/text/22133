The '''Web Open Font Format''' (WOFF), a format developed during 2009, is essentially a wrapper that contains [[sfnt]]-based fonts ([[TrueType]] (TTF), [[OpenType]] or [[OpenType|Open Font Format]]) that have been compressed using a WOFF encoding tool to enable them to be embedded in a web page.<ref name="spec">{{cite web|url=http://people.mozilla.org/~jkew/woff/woff-spec-latest.html|title=WOFF File Format  (draft of 2009-10-23)|last=Kew|first=Jonathan|coauthors=Tal Leming (Type Supply),  Erik van Blokland (LettError)|date=2009-10-23|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref> The format uses [[zlib]] compression (specifically, the compress2 function),<ref name="spec"/> typically resulting in a filesize reduction from TTF of over 40%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phpied.com/font-face-gzipping-take-ii|title=@font-face gzipping - take II|date=October 20th, 2009|publisher=[[PHPied]].com|first=Stoyan|last=Stefanov|accessdate=30 January 2010}}</ref>
