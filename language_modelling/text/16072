{{House of Hanover|george3}}
'''George V, King of Hanover and 2nd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, ''Georg Friedrich Alexander Karl Ernst August'''''  ([[27 May]] [[1819]] &ndash; [[12 June]] [[1878]]) was the only son of [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernst August I, King of Hanover and 1st Duke of Cumberland]] (fifth son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]]) and his wife [[Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Princess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. He was a first cousin of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. He was the last sovereign ruler of the Kingdom of [[Hanover (state)|Hanover]] and the ancestor of the German branch of the [[House of Hanover]].

==Early life==
His Royal Highness Prince George Frederick Alexander Charles Ernest Augustus, [[Order of the Garter|KG]], was born in [[Berlin]]. Originally styled Prince George of Cumberland, he spent his childhood in Berlin and in Britain. He lost the sight of one eye during a childhood illness, and the other in an accident in 1833. His uncle, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]], created him a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] on [[15 August]] [[1835]].

==Crown Prince==
Upon the death of William IV and the ascension of Queen Victoria, the 123-year personal union of the British and Hanoverian thrones ended because of the operation of [[Salic Law]] in the German states. The Duke of Cumberland succeeded to the Hanoverian throne as King Ernst August I and Prince George of Cumberland became the Crown Prince of Hanover. As a legitimate male-line descendant of George III, he remained a member of the [[British Royal Family]] and was second in line to the British throne until the birth of Queen Victoria's first child, [[Victoria, Princess Royal and Empress Frederick|Victoria, Princess Royal]], in 1841. Being totally blind there were doubts whether the Crown Prince was qualified to succeed to the government of Hanover; but his father decided that he should do so.

==King of Hanover==

The Crown Prince succeeded his father as the [[King of Hanover]] and [[Duke of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg]], as well as [[Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale]] (in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]) and [[Earl of Armagh]] (in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]), on [[18 November]] [[1851]], assuming the style George V. From his father and from his maternal uncle, Prince [[Charles Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (1785<U+2014>1837), one of the most influential men at the [[Prussia]]n court, George had learned to take a very high and autocratic view of royal authority. During his fifteen-year reign, he engaged in frequent disputes with the Hanoverian [[Landtag]] (parliament). Having supported [[Austria]] in the [[Reichstag (institution)|Diet]] of the [[German Confederation]] in June 1866, he refused, contrary to the wishes of his parliament, to assent to the Prussian demand that Hanover should observe an unarmed neutrality during the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. As a result, the Prussian army occupied Hanover and the Hanoverian army surrendered on [[29 June]] [[1866]], the king and royal family having fled to Austria. The Prussian government formally [[annexed]] Hanover on [[20 September]], but the deposed king never renounced his rights to the throne nor acknowledged Prussia's actions. From exile in [[Gmunden]], Austria, he appealed in vain for the European great powers to intervene on behalf of Hanover.

==Marriage==
George married, on [[18 February]] [[1843]], at Hanover, Her Highness Princess (Alexandrine) [[Marie of Saxe-Altenburg]] ([[14 April]] [[1818]]-[[9 January]] [[1907]]), the eldest daughter of Josef, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, by his wife Duchess Amelia of W<U+00FC>rttemburg.

==Later life==
King George V died in Paris in June 1878. He was buried in [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]], [[Windsor Castle]].
