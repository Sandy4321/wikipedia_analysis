The '''art of Urartu''' refers to a historical and regional type of art from [[Urartu]], the ancient state of [[Western Asia]] which existed in the period 13-6 century BC in the [[Armenian Highland]]. The art of Urartu was strongly influenced by the nearby [[Assyria]], the most prominent state of that period in the region. It peaked around the 8th century BC but was mostly looted and destroyed with the fall of Urartu about a century later.<ref name=c148>Chahin, 148</ref><ref name=brit>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619349/Urartu Urartu], Encyclopedia Britannica online</ref>

== Overview ==
Urartian art was heavily influenced by the neighboring Assyria, and despite the obvious stylistic differences, has long been considered a branch of the Assyrian art. Urartian art is characterized by 1) a more rigorous than in other cultures of the Ancient East following the [[Aesthetic canon|canon]], 2) preference to [[Ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] rather than life scenes, and 3) copying old samples instead of improving them.<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"><U+041F><U+0438><U+043E><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0411>. <U+0411>. <U+0418><U+0441><U+043A><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0423><U+0440><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0443> VIII<U+2014>VI <U+0432><U+0432>. <U+0434><U+043E> <U+043D>. <U+044D>.

==Bronze statuettes ==
Although Urartian masters were capable of producing large bronze statue, not even their fragments have been found so far. Literature mentions that while looting the city of [[Musasir]], Assyrians removed a bronze statue of [[List of kings of Urartu|King]] [[Argishti I]] weighing 60 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] (about 1,8 tons). Small bronze art items of Urartu were exclusively made for the king's palace and are divided into three groups: [[throne]] decorations, ornament on copper boilers and rare statuettes of Urartian gods. 

===Throne decorations ===
Between 1877 and 1885, local treasure hunters sold a few small bronze fragments to several European museums. These fragments later turned out to be parts of one and the same Urartian king's throne. They were cast in bronze into a mold and then gilded by wrapping in thin [[gold]] sheets. The fragments are currently preserved in the [[British Museum]], [[Hermitage]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and in private collections in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]].

===Boiler decorations ===
{{double image|right|UrartianCaldron02.jpg|165|UrartianCaldron03~.jpg|290|Left: boiler with bull heads found in [[Van Province]], Turkey. Right: boiler from a [[Phrygia]]n city with figures assigned to the god [[Shivini]].<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/><ref name=ank>[[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]], Turkey</ref>}}

Boiler decorations are the best preserved objects of Urartian bronze art; therefore, they were used in the early 20th century to identify the Urartian style in art.<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/> The decorated [[copper]] boilers were apparently used for ritual ceremonies. For example, the annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention a bronze vessel filled with the wine being part of the sacrifice to God [[<U+1E2A>aldi]]. 

The bronze statuettes were cast separately and then attached to the boiler. They include bull heads and winged deities, possibly god [[Shivini]] and his wife [[Tushpuea]].<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/> The technique of [[casting]] bronze ornaments spread from [[Urartu]] to the neighboring countries, in particular to [[Phrygia]], and then to Europe. Urartian boiler ornaments were found in [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Athens]], [[Boeotia]], [[Delphi]], [[Olympia]] and [[Etruscan]] tombs. Initially, many Urartian decorations have been taken by researchers in [[Antiquity|ancient]], but since the 1950s, after detailed studies of these ornaments boilers have been identified and unanimously ranked as the monuments of Urartu art <ref name="Pallottino">{{cite journal|author=Pallottino, M. |title=Urartu, Greece and Etruria|journal= East and West|volume=9|issue=1<U+2013>2|place=Rome|year=1958}}</ref><ref name="Amandry">Amandry P.

Scientists have even been instances when the Urartian bronze figures for the boilers used by other nations again to decorate the new vessels.

===Statuettes of gods ===

Only three bronze statuettes depicting Urartian deities have been preserved. One, possibly of the god [[<U+1E2A>aldi]], is stored in the British Museum, and two others are in the National Museum of History of Armenia (copy in the Erebuni Museum, Yerevan, see image).

== Weapons ==
=== Helmets===

Numerous Urartian helmets have been recovered, more than 20 only during the excavations of [[Teishebaini]]. Royal ceremonial helmets did not differ in shape from simple combat helmets but contained engraved images.

=== Shields=== 
A few decorative bronze Urartian shields have been found near Van (they are stored in the British Museum and Berlin museums) and 14 were excavated at [[Karmir Blur]]. They have diameters ranging between 70 and 100 cm and were not made for combat, as judged from the thickness of metal and the character of the handles. All these shields contain concentric circles of lions and bulls which were designed so that no figure would appear upside down. The images were first stamped and then deepened with various instruments. Assyrian king Sargon II described six golden Urartian shields, which were looted in [[Musasir]], weighing 6.5 kg each. They have not been recovered thus far.

===Quivers === 
Only three royal Urartian [[quiver]]s are known, all found during the excavations of [[Teishebaini]]. They are made of bronze and contain images of Urartian warriors.

The belts were about 1 meter long and 12 cm wide and aimed to protected archers.

=== Jewelry===
Jewelry of Urartu had two gradations: ornaments made of precious metals and stones for the king and his family and their simplified bronze versions used by the riches. Many jewelry items were also used as amulets.<ref name="Esayan">{{cite journal|author=<U+0415><U+0441><U+0430><U+044F><U+043D> <U+0421>.|title=<U+042E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043B><U+0438><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0438><U+0441><U+043A><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E> <U+0423><U+0440><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0443> (Jewelry art of Urartu) |journal=<U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E>-<U+0444><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0436><U+0443><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B>|place=Yerevan|volume=3|year=2003}}</ref> Annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention vast amounts of Urartian jewelry items made of silver and gold which were taken from Musasir in 714 BC.<ref name=c148/> They are not preserved and  some may have been melted by treasure hunters.<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/> The two largest recovered jewelry items are shown below. They are the pectoral decoration excavated at the late Urartian capital [[Rusahinili]] and the cover of the boiler found at Teishebaini. Smaller items include golden pins, earrings, a [[bracelet]] and a few medallions. Jewelry was worn in Urartu by both man and women. Women's jewelry usually portrayed Urartian goddess [[Arubani]], wife of <U+1E2A>aldi <U+2013> the supreme god of Urartu. Also common are Mesopotamian motifs such as [[tree of life]] and [[winged sun]]. More accessible jewelry included bronze bracelets and earrings and [[carnelian]] beads.<ref name="Esayan"/>

===Cylinder seals ===
Similar to other ancient states of [[Middle East]], Urartu used [[cylinder seal]]s. They depicted Moon, stars, religious images and sometimes hunting scenes.

Many features of Urartian art were preserved in the neighboring countries after the fall of Urartu in the 6th century BC. Observations by [[Boris Piotrovsky]] suggest that decoration and production techniques of [[Scythians|scythian]] belts and [[scabbard]]s were borrowed from Urartu.<ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/> The Urartian way of decorating boilers spread over the ancient world, and it is believed that [[Art of Armenia|Armenian]] and South [[Georgia]]n art were partly based on the Urartian traditions.<ref name="Piotrovskiy1959"/><ref Name="Stepanyan"><U+0421><U+0442><U+0435><U+043F><U+0430><U+043D><U+044F><U+043D> <U+041D>.
