'''Tropical Storm Beryl''' was the third [[Tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Developing from a tropical disturbance on [[July 18]], it tracked generally northward, and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) under generally favorable conditions. After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters. On [[July 21]] it struck the island of [[Nantucket]], and shortly thereafter it became extratropical. The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through [[Nova Scotia]], and on [[July 22]] it merged with an approaching cold front.

Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline. In [[Massachusetts]], its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage. Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada, resulting in some localized power outages though little damage. No deaths were reported.

==Storm history==

A [[cold front]] moved off the [[East Coast of the United States]] on [[July 16]] and stalled off the coast of [[North Carolina]]. It gradually decayed into a surface [[low pressure area|low pressure]] [[trough (meteorology)|trough]],<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-05-22|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL022006_Beryl.pdf}}</ref> and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290&nbsp;miles (490&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cape Cod]] and another was located 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km south of [[Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]].<ref name="two2">{{cite web|author=MAINELLI/BEVEN|year=2006|title=July 16, 2006 Tropical Weather Outlook (2)|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2006071621.ABNT20}}</ref> The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm,<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Blake and John Beven|year=2006|title=Unnamed Tropical Storm Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-05-22|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL502006_Unnamed.pdf}}</ref> and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined.<ref name="two3">{{cite web| author = Pasch | year = 2006| title = July 17, 2006 Tropical Weather Outlook|publisher=National Hurricane Center | accessdate=2006-07-20 | url = ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Outlook-A/2006071709.ABNT20 }}</ref> However, by [[July 18]], the system became much better organized with improved [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]], and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220&nbsp;miles (355&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]].<ref name="td2disc1">{{cite web|author=Stewart|year=2006|title=Tropical Depression Two Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/dis/al022006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression moved slowly to the north-northwest through a break in the [[subtropical ridge]],<ref name="td2disc1"/> and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical [[wind shear]] and well-established upper-level [[tropical cyclone#structure|outflow]].<ref name="tcr"/> Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection,<ref name="disc3">{{cite web|author=Avila|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Three|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/dis/al022006.discus.003.shtml?}}</ref> though deep convection re-developed the following morning.<ref name="disc4">{{cite web|author=Pasch|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-07-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/dis/al022006.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> Outflow continued to improve, and with warm [[sea surface temperatures]] Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) early on [[July 20]] while located about 120&nbsp;miles (190&nbsp;km) east of [[Nags Head, North Carolina]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18&nbsp;hours as it paralleled the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New Jersey]] coasts,<ref name="tcr"/> during which an [[eye (cyclone)|eye-like]] feature developed in the center of the convection.<ref name="chc720">{{cite web|author=Bowyer|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Information Statement on July 20, 2006|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=2007-05-24|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20060720175858.Beryl.txt.en}}</ref> Late on [[July 20]], it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters.

==Preparations==
Forecasters initially predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas; as such, a [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings|tropical storm watch]] was issued for the eastern coast of [[North Carolina]] from [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina|Cape Lookout]] northward to [[Currituck Beach Lighthouse]]. When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours prior to moving ashore from [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts|Woods Hole]] to [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]], including [[Cape Cod]], [[Nantucket]], and [[Martha's Vineyard]]. About 22&nbsp;hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and for the eastern portion of [[Long Island]] from east of [[Fire Island, New York|Fire Island]] to [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]].<ref name="tcr"/> In anticipation for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. Local [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] chapters were opened, as well,<ref name="bg721"/> with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Shipman|year=2006|title=Tropical Storm Beryl Threatens New England with Wind, Rain|publisher=Charter Oak Chapter of the American Red Cross|accessdate=2007-05-22|url=http://charteroak.redcross.org/media/Beryl_Preparations_7-20-06.pdf}}</ref> Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage.<ref name="bg721"/>

Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through [[Atlantic Canada]], the [[Canadian Hurricane Centre]] issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off of [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland]].<ref name="chc720"/> In anticipation of heavy rainfall, the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia, including [[Halifax County, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].<ref name="chc721"/>

==Impact==

Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at 60&nbsp;mph (96&nbsp;km/h) in southern Nova Scotia. The winds downed some tree limbs and led to some power outages.
