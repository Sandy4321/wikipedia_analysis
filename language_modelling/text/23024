The '''New Zealand Esperanto Association, Incorporated''' (in Esperanto: Nov-Zelanda Esperanto-Asocio; in Maori: Te R<U+014D>p<U+016B> o Aotearoa m<U+014D> te Reo o te Ao) is the national [[Esperanto]] association of New Zealand. NZEA is an Incorporated Society in New Zealand. NZEA is affiliated to the [[Universala Esperanto-Asocio]].

The web site of the Association (see external links below) contains much information about the Association and its activities.

==Annual Congress==

The New Zealand Esperanto Association generally arranges an annual Esperanto congress. The congress is usually of 3 to 5 days duration and occurs usually in January or February. There are nearly always some visiting Esperanto speakers from overseas taking part. About every fourth year NZEA has a combined congress with the [[Australian Esperanto Association]], either in NZ or in Australia. For example in January 2008 a very successful ''Oceanea Congress'' took place in Auckland with many Esperantists from Australia and other countries. There were classes in the Esperanto language for beginners, learners and fluent speakers. There were also sessions about the language, entertainment and the annual meeting of the Association, etc.

==Publications==

The official journal of NZEA is called ''Esperanto sub la Suda Kruco''. It is published jointly with the Australian Esperanto Association. Non-members can also subscribe to the magazine via the AEA's bookshop site (see link below).

NZEA also sends members a newsletter called ''Ar<U+011D>enta Filiko'' (see link below), usually twice a year. It aims principally to inform members about congress arrangements.

==History==

NZEA was founded in Auckland on 1 February 1910. The first president of the Association was Mr George Aldridge of Auckland. Dr [[L. L. Zamenhof]] agreed to be the Honorary President.
The then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir [[Joseph Ward]] and George Fowler M.P. became patrons of the Association.

During the First World War the Association ceased to exist. It was revived in 1928 under a new President Mr (later Professor) C. [[John Adcock]].

In 1983 the Inland Revenue Department granted NZEA the status of [[Charitable organisation]].

==Book Service==

Members of NZEA have access to the bookshop of the AEA. For more information see the official Libroservo website below.
