The '''Battle of Maryang San''' was fought during the [[Korean War]] from 3<U+2212>8 October 1951 between United Nations forces<U+2014>primarily Australian and British<U+2014>and the Chinese communist [[People<U+2019>s Volunteer Army]]. The fighting occurred during a limited UN offensive, codenamed [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]], which pushed the Chinese back from the [[Imjin River]] to the [[Jamestown Line]]. The battle occurred over a five-day period and saw the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], in conjunction with other units of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]], dislodge a numerically superior Chinese force from the Kowang-San and Maryang San features. Using tactics first developed against the [[Japan]]ese in [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] during the [[Second World War]], the Australians gained the advantage of the high ground and assaulted the Chinese positions from unexpected directions. They then repelled repeated Chinese counter-attacks aimed at re-capturing Maryang San, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Today, the battle is widely regarded as one of [[Australian Army]]<U+2019>s greatest accomplishments during the war.

==Background==
In the months following the battles of the [[Battle of the Imjin River|Imjin River]] and the [[Battle of Kapyong|Kapyong]] in late-April 1951, the organisation of British Commonwealth ground forces fighting in Korea as part of the [[United Nations]] had undergone considerable change. 3RAR had been transferred from [[27th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|27th British Infantry Brigade]] to the [[28th British Commonwealth Brigade]] when that formation departed for [[Hong Kong]]. Meanwhile, after protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the various logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents.<ref name=O<U+2019>Neill166>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 166.</ref>

By late-1951 the British Commonwealth ground forces consisted primarily of the [[1st Commonwealth Division]]. The division included the [[25th Canadian Infantry Brigade|25th Canadian]], 28th British Commonwealth and [[29th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th British]] infantry brigades under the command of [[Lieutenant General]] [[James Cassels (British Army officer)|James Cassels]] (later Field Marshal Sir James), and was part of [[I Corps (United States)|US I Corps]]. The 28th British Commonwealth Brigade included three infantry battalions<U+2014>the 1st Battalion, [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]], 1st Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]]  and the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment<U+2014>under the command of [[Brigadier]] [[George Taylor (soldier)|George Taylor]].<ref>Grey 1988, pp. 192<U+2013>195.</ref> 3RAR was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Hassett]].<ref name=Coulthard266>Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 266.</ref>

Since its formation on 28 July 1951, the 1st Commonwealth Division had occupied part of the west-central sector of the UN line, approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of the capital [[Seoul]].<ref>Grey 1988, p. 135.</ref> Peace-talks at [[Kaesong]] during July and September led to a lull in the fighting and 3RAR undertook mainly defensive duties, helping to construct the defences of the Kansas Line south of the Imjin River, and extensive patrolling on the northern side.<ref name=Kuring238>Kuring 2004, p. 238.</ref> The battalion also used the reduced operational tempo as an opportunity to train reinforcements. The period culminated in a limited, and largely unopposed, divisional advance {{convert|12|km|mi}} north of the Imjin to the Wyoming Line, codenamed [[Operation Minden]], in September.<ref name=Horner72>Horner 2008, p. 72.</ref><ref name=Kuring238/>

[[File:British Centurion tank Korea May 1953 (AWM HOBJ4255).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A British [[Centurion tank]] similar to those used at Maryang San.]]

On 14 April 1951, [[General]] [[James Van Fleet]] had replaced General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]] as commander of the [[US Eighth Army]] and the [[United Nations]] forces in Korea.<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 132.</ref> The Chinese Spring Offensive during April and May 1951 ended in its defeat, while following two months of sporadic operations in mid-June and August, the war entered a new phase, with Van Fleet returning to the offensive. In July the Kansas and Wyoming Lines were strengthened, while a limited offensive in the east-central sector in mid-August seized the high ground around the Punchbowl and Bloody Ridge. In September the offensive in this sector continued, targeting the next hill complex north of Bloody Ridge, known as Heartbreak Ridge.<ref name=ONeill165>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 165.</ref> In late-September and early October<U+2014>even while continuing the attack against Heartbreak Ridge<U+2014>Van Fleet developed a plan for a limited offensive in the western section, known as Operation Commando, to advance {{convert|10|km|mi}} north of the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], with the aim of pushing Chinese forces back and giving United Nations forces more leverage at  the truce negotiations now occurring at [[Panmunjom]].<ref name=ONeill165/> Operation Commando was scheduled for 3<U+2013>5 October 1951<ref name=Horner72/> and [[Lieutenant General]] [[John W. O'Daniel]], the US I Corps commander, envisioned three of the four [[Division (military)|division]]s of the US I Corps and the [[US 25th Infantry Division]] on the left flank of the neighbouring [[IX Corps (United States)|US IX Corps]], advancing to seize a new defensive line known as the [[Jamestown Line]].<ref name=Horner72/> The divisions to be used in the advance included the [[1st Commonwealth Division]], [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|US 1st Cavalry Division]] and [[9th Infantry Division (South Korea)|9th South Korean Division]] while the [[1st Infantry Division (South Korea)|1st South Korean Division]] would remain in its existing position on the left flank.<ref>O'Neill 1985, p. 181.</ref> 

In the sector occupied by 1st Commonwealth Division, Chinese communist forces were dug into a group of hills overlooking the [[Imjin River]]. The task allocated to the British Commonwealth force was to take these positions with the intention of advance the line from the southern bank of the Imjin to a line of hills to the north, in total an objective that stretched more than {{convert|15|km|mi}}.<ref>O'Neill 1985, p. 166.</ref> The primary objectives of the advance would be the capture of Kowang-San (Hill 355) and Maryang San (Hill 317) and the task of taking these positions was allocated to the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade, with this formation which would bear the brunt of the fighting.<ref name=Coulthard266/><ref group=note>Kowang-San (Hill 355) was also known as 'Little Gibraltar' to the Americans and is often referred to as such in histories of the battle.</ref> Cassels planned on capturing the Jamestown Line in three phases. In the first phase, scheduled for 3 October, the 28th Brigade would take Hill 355 in the east-central sector. During the second phase, on 4 October, the 25th Brigade would assault the two Hill 187 features and the south-western ridge running to the Samichon River. Lastly during the third phase, scheduled for 5 October, the 28th Brigade would capture Hills 217 and 317.<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, pp. 183<U+2013>184.</ref> As such, the bulk of the division<U+2019>s strength would be concentrated on the right flank, to be held by the 28th Brigade, while the 25th Brigade would hold the left flank and the 29th Brigade would be held in reserve and also provided a [[battalion]] to each of the other [[brigade]]s as reinforcements.<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 183.</ref>  The division faced two regiments from the [[191st Division (China)|191st Chinese Division]], [[64th Army (People's Republic of China)|64th Army]], with a third regiment in support, each of about 2,000 men dug-in in well prepared defensive positions with overhead protection. 28th Brigade faced one of the two forward [[regiment]]s<U+2014>the 571st Regiment<U+2014>which was deployed with one battalion on Hill 355, a second on Hill 217 and Hill 317 and a third in reserve to the west.<ref name=ONeill184/>

[[File:NZ artillery 25 pounder Korea 1951 (AWM HOBJ2238).jpg|thumb|right|180px|New Zealand 25 pounder in Korea.]]

Kowang-San would be assaulted during the first phase by 1KOSB with the KSLI and 3RAR in support, while Maryang San would be taken in the third phase of the operation by 3RAR and the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]], who were under commander from 29th Brigade for the during of Operation Commando.<ref name=Horner72/> Careful reconnaissance and planning took place in the week prior to the commencement of the operation<ref name=ONeill184>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 184.</ref> and Taylor emphasised the use of indirect fires, air support and infiltration tactics to limit casualties, as well as the exploitation of weak points in the Chinese defences.<ref name=Malkasian151>Malkasian 2002, p. 151.</ref> In direct support of the brigade was [[16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery]] with its [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25 pounder]]s, in addition to divisional and corps assets which included 4.2 inch mortars and US 3 inch howitzers and 155 mm heavy artillery; in total more than 120 guns and mortars. Also in support were two British [[Centurion tank|Centurion]] tank [[squadrons]] from the [[8th Royal Irish Hussars]].<ref name=ONeill184/> Given the primary task of capturing Hill 317, Hassett studied the approaches from the air and the ground. Two previous attempts to take Maryang San by American troops had been unsuccessful.<ref name=awm /> Regardless, utilising tactics first developed against the Japanese in New Guinea during the Second World War of running along the tops of ridges, he intended to gain the advantage of the high ground, the cover afforded by the jungle and the ease of movement along a crest-line to assault the Chinese positions from unexpected directions.<ref name=ONeill184/>

However, during the first phase of the operation the Australians would be tasked with capturing a Chinese outpost on Hill 199 to allow tanks and medium machine-guns to provide direct fires onto the northern and eastern slopes of Hill 355 in support of an attack by the KOSB from the south-east. Likewise the KSLI would assault and capture Hill 208. Finally then, two days before the start of Operation Commando, the 28th Brigade crossed the Imjin river to assemble behind the 25th Brigade on 1 October. The following day the 3RAR, less D Company, and the KOSBs moved forward carefully into their assembly areas, ready to advance the following morning.<ref name=ONeill185>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 185.</ref> C Company advanced to a position {{convert|1500|m|yd}} in front of the Canadian positions, north-east of Hill 355. B Company was {{convert|200|m|yd}} to the rear. In the afternoon C Company was subjected to heavy shelling, losing one soldier wounded.<ref name=Horner445>Horner 1990, p. 445.</ref> D Company<U+2014>under the command of Major Basil Hardiman<U+2014>was detached to 25th Brigade to strengthen its extended front, and it would not be available until the afternoon of 3 October.<ref name=ONeill185/>

==Battle==
===Capture of Hill 199, 3 October 1951===
At 0300 on 3 October, B Company 3RAR moved north {{convert|2000|m|yd}} across the open valley under the cover of darkness and heavy mist toward Hill 199. A Company moved up behind C Company.<ref name=Horner445/> Artillery and mortar fire targeted known Chinese artillery positions with counter-battery fire before dawn before switching to support the KOSBs in their assault on Hill 355. Simultaneously, the KSLI were assaulting Hill 208 and with the support of A Squadron, 8th Royal Irish Hussars they reached the positions without opposition by 0600.<ref name=Breen21>Breen 1994, p. 21.</ref><ref name=Johnston165>Johnston 2003, p. 165.</ref> By 0800 B Company had gained the high ground to the north and then proceeded to patrol the short distance to the west to the objective which was taken with three wounded, killing five Chinese and capturing one.<ref name=Horner445/><ref name=Breen21/> By mid-morning both the Shropshire<U+2019>s and the Australians had successfully captured their objectives by mid-morning.<ref name=Breen23>Breen 1994, p. 23.</ref>

Expecting a counter-attack the Australians on Hill 199 began digging-in, however no such attack occurred. D Company subsequently returned and was allocated a position between C Company and the KOSB. C and B Company both received shelling during the day, wounding two men.<ref name=Breen21/> At 1000 A Company<U+2014>under Captain Jim Shelton<U+2014>took over the defence of Hill 199, and B Company went into reserve behind A Company.<ref name=Horner445/> According to plan, a troop of Centurion tanks and a section of medium machine guns were then moved up onto Hill 199 and began directing their fire onto the northern slopes of Hill 355 in support of the 1KOSB attack.<ref name=Horner445/> Meanwhile, at 0715, following preparation by artillery and mortar fire, the lead British assault companies had began to advance on Hill 355. However, with the Chinese expecting an assault from that direction, the initial British moves met strong resistance and the KOSBs were forced to withdraw and reorganised. At 1415 a second assault gained objectives on the lower slopes and these were consolidated by nightfall.<ref name=Breen23/>

The attack was now behind schedule. Indeed the Borderers were still more than {{convert|1000|yd|m}} short of their objective, and with stubborn resistance being encountered during the initial phase, Hill 355 would now not be secured until the afternoon of 4 October.<ref name=Coulthard267>Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 267.</ref> To be sure the assault was being slowed by two positions on the north-east slopes of Hill 355<U+2014>known as Hill 220<U+2014>from which the Chinese held the British right flank in [[enfilade]]. C Company 3RAR would be detached to assist the attack on Kowang-San the next morning, and the Australians would be tasked with outflanking the Chinese defences and capturing this position.<ref name=Breen23/><ref name=Horner446>Horner 1990, p. 446.</ref> Heavy Chinese artillery fire had also slowed progress with more than 2,500 rounds falling in the brigade area in the last twenty-hours, although this total was dwarfed many times over by the weight of allied artillery fired across the 28th Brigade front, which included 22,324 rounds.<ref name=Johnston165/> On the division<U+2019>s left flank, the delay also meant that the Canadian attack scheduled for 0600 the next day in the 25th Brigade sector would have to be postponed until 1100, due to the continuing requirement to use the divisional artillery in support of 28th Brigade.<ref name=Johnston165/>

===Capture of Hill 220 and the fall of Kowang-San, 4 October 1951===
On 4 October, C Company 3RAR<U+2014>under the command of Major Jack Gerke<U+2014>attacked the long spur running east from the peak of Hill 355, known as Hill 220. Launching their assault at 0900, the Australians quickly killed or drove off the defenders before pressing on up the spur and routing the remainder of a Chinese company. Reaching their objectives by 1000, the Australians then took advantage of the initiative gained so far, pushing a platoon towards the summit of Hill 355. Amid heavy fighting, the Australians cleared the eastern slopes of Kowang-San by 1200, despite having received no orders to do so.<ref name=Johnston165/> 13 Chinese were killed and three captured in the fighting, while Australians casualties included 11 wounded, one of whom later died.<ref name=Horner446/> Gerke was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his leadership.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 114.</ref> C Company subsequently withdrew to the rear of the 3RAR position and were replaced by D Company, who occupied the position held by A Company {{convert|500|m|yd}} north of Hill 199.<ref name=Horner446/> Meanwhile, led by a [[bagpiper]], the Borderers made a simultaneous assault up the western face of Kowang-San, and fearing they may be caught between two attacks the Chinese defenders abandoned Hill 355, withdrawing northwest under heavy indirect fire.<ref name=Johnston165/> 

Given the strong resistance exhibited by the Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as the 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives as part of the second phase. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry|2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] encountered any opposition, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed before they captured the two Hill 187 features. Indeed the ease with which the Canadians had captured their objective allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next 22 months of fighting.<ref>Johnston 2003, pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref>

On the 28th Brigade<U+2019>s left flank the Shropshires met slight resistance, securing Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 1010. They were then relieved by the Canadians by nightfall in preparation for the third phase of the operation.<ref>Johnston 2003, pp. 165<U+2013>166.</ref> The brigade plan was now a day behind schedule, although with the unexpected ease experienced by the Canadians, overall, the divisional attack was still running according to plan.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 34.</ref> However, determined to hold on following the loss of Hill 355 the Chinese moved in fresh troops, heavily reinforcing a number of positions, including Maryang San.<ref name=Breen37>Breen 1994, p. 37.</ref>

===Fall of Maryang San, 5 October 1951===
[[File:F-51Ds 2 Sqn SAAF Korea May 1951.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|No. 2 Squadron SAAF [[P-51 Mustang|Mustang]] fighters during the [[Korean War]]]]

The final objective was Maryang San, a steep hill rising {{convert|200|m|ft}} above the valley about {{convert|2500|m|yd}} north of Hill 355.<ref name=awm /> Following the delay in capturing Hill 355, Hassett would not be ready to implement his plan until early the next day.<ref name=Coulthard267/> As such the third and final phase of the attack would begin on 5 October, with the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers scheduled to attack an intermediate objective adjacent Kowang-San<U+2014>Hill 217<U+2014>before assisting the Australians assault Hill 317.<ref name=Horner446/> The Australians moved into position north-east of Hill 199 on the afternoon of 4 October, while over the night of 4<U+2013>5 October the divisional artillery hit Chinese positions, with two batteries of 8 inch howitzers and another two 155mm batteries supplementing them. [[Air strikes]] by the [[P51 Mustang|Mustangs]] of [[2 Squadron SAAF|No. 2 Squadron, South African Airforce]] were also planned, targeting Chinese concentrations north and west of the objectives to cut-off supplies and reinforcements.<ref>Breen 1994, pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> Both the Australians and Fusiliers were scheduled to begin their attacks at first light<U+2014>at 0545<U+2014>following a heavy artillery preparation.<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 188.</ref>

In the dark the Fusiliers moved off but amid dense fog they had found it difficult to maintain their bearings and they were unable to be in position in time to commence the attack as planned. By 1000 they had struggled to within {{convert|300|m|yd}} from their objective and following further delays the assault was commenced at 1100. After initially achieving surprise a number of the forward Chinese outposts fell to the Fusiliers. Occupying strong defensive positions on Hill 217, the Chinese regained the initiative however, and poured heavy machine gun and rifle fire onto the attackers as they crossed the valley, forcing them to withdraw after suffering heavy casualties and running low on ammunition.<ref name=Breen61>Breen 1994, p. 61.</ref> Having expected the main [[axis of assault]] from the south, the Chinese positions were stronger than previously considered and the Fusiliers were unable to gain the summit, despite one company gaining a toehold on the summit by midday.<ref name=Horner446/><ref name=Breen61/><ref name=ONeill195>O'Neill 1985, p. 195.</ref>

Earlier that morning at 0445, B and D Company 3RAR had moved north across the valley, while Anti-Tank Platoon crossed the Imjin, taking up positions further north still in order to protect the right flank. The assaulting companies would then move west towards a series of objectives before assaulting Hill 317.<ref name=Horner446/> Initially 3RAR was to attack from the east, while 1RNF would attack from the southwest through Hill 217, however with the Fusiliers facing stiff resistance on Hill 217 itself they were unable to get forward to assist.<ref name=Horner446/> Three previous attempts to capture Maryang San had failed due to the approach to steep eastern slopes of the feature being across a wide, open valley that was dominated by enfilade fire from mutually supporting Chinese positions. Consequently the Australians planned to cross the valley under cover of darkness and position themselves on the Chinese flank in the foothills, before scaling the position at first light. A Company would created diversion on the left flank, while B Company would clear the lower slopes before D Company passed through to assault the Chinese main defensive position, known as the 'Victor' feature, in a one-up one-in-depth assault.<ref name=Coulthard267/> Following the casualties of previous nights on Hill 199, 220 and 355, and the effect of constant shelling, 3RAR was now reduced to just 320 men. In contrast, although unknown at the time, the Australians faced two fresh Chinese battalions on Maryang San, in total about 1,200 men.<ref name=Breen37/> 

B Company<U+2014>commanded by Captain Henry Nicholls<U+2014>lead off shrouded in the heavy mist, and with visibility limited in the thick vegetation, it drifted to the right off the intended axis of advance having lost direction, suffering a similar fate as the Fusiliers.<ref name=Horner446/> Disorientated, the assaulting companies became separated and the battalion attack turned into a series of independent attacks.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 41.</ref> D Company slowly continued forward however, and when the mist lifted suddenly at 1120 they were left dangerously exposed still only halfway up the slope to their objective. The Australian approach had surprised the Chinese however, who were apparently expecting the assault from the north, and D Company succeeded in closing to within [[grenade]] range of the Chinese on Victor. During a fierce twenty-minute fire-fight the Australians cleared their first objective with the assistance of direct fire from supporting tanks, and indirect fire support from artillery, losing three killed and 12 wounded.<ref name=Horner446/><ref name=Coulthard267/> Chinese losses included 30 killed and 10 captured.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 43.</ref> Included among the Australian wounded was the company commander and one of the platoon commanders, both of whom remained in command despite gunshot wounds.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 44.</ref> 

During the initial phase A Company, as part of the diversion plan, had attacked southwest along a spur leading to Hill 317 and had meet stiff opposition.<ref>Horner 1990, pp. 446<U+2013>447.</ref> The diversion was largely successful however, causing the Chinese to reinforce against the A Company attack, which they believed to be the main effort.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 49.</ref> Meanwhile, D Company continued to press their attack along the high ground towards the <U+2018>Uniform<U+2019> feature, assaulting the deeply entrenched Chinese positions, which included heavy automatic weapons. By 1600 it had successfully captured the last of it the intermediate objectives assigned to it and a platoon from B Company was pushed forward to assist in the clearance of the feature. Lieutenant L.G. Clark was awarded the Military Cross for his actions, will Sergeant W.J. Rowlinson was awarded a bar to the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]].<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 192.</ref> By this time total Chinese casualties included 98 killed and 40 captured, while undoubtedly a large number had also been wounded.<ref name=Horner446/> Following the progress of B and D Company, C Company was moved up behind them and with the capture of final objective they immediately commenced an assault on Hill 317, capturing 10 prisoners for no loss.<ref name=Horner447>Horner 1990, p. 447</ref> Although the Chinese had been well dug-in, there was no barbed wire obstacles to hamper the attackers and the Australians had rapidly gained the position.<ref name=Kuring239>Kuring 2004, p. 239.</ref> By 1700, Maryang San had fallen to the Australians, with the Chinese withdrawing under heavy artillery, mortar and machine gun fire.<ref name=Breen57>Breen 1994, p. 57.</ref> 

On Hill 217 the Fusiliers had maintained the pressure on the Chinese through out the day, however they were still unable to capture the feature.<ref name=Horner446/> Regardless, the efforts of Fusiliers in conjunction with A Company's diversionary attack and the rapid advance of D Company with tank and artillery support had carried the day.<ref name=Horner447/> A Company continued to attack against heavy opposition and indirect fire, slowly pushing the Chinese defenders back. Later, a platoon was detached to assist C Company consolidate the defence of Maryang San following its capture, while the remaining two platoons were withdrawn rearwards, again under heavy artillery fire.<ref name=Horner447/> Indeed although it had played a supporting role in the attack, the efforts of A Company had been vital, suffering 20 casualties while killing at least 25 Chinese and capturing two.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 58.</ref> 

Now, with Maryang San captured, the Australians began digging-in, modifying the south-facing linear Chinese trench system into an all round defensive position, with mutually supporting weapons pits.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 59.</ref> Fully expecting a Chinese counter-attack that evening, Hasset moved the Assault Pioneer Platoon to bolster the hasty defences.<ref name=Breen57/> Meanwhile, the Chinese still occupied three key ridgeline positions<U+2014>the 'Sierra' feature, the 'Hinge' and the summit of Hill 317 itself<U+2014>which they continued to furiously defend, and these would be the scene of considerable fighting in the days to come as the Australians attempted to clear them.<ref name=Horner73>Horner 2008, p. 73.</ref>

===The Hinge, 6<U+2013>8 October 1951===
With both sides exhausted from the fighting, the night of 5<U+2013>6 October was less eventful then expected and the Australians used the opportunity to develop their position.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 62.</ref> To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese defences, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position<U+2014>a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge, known as the Sierra feature<U+2014>the next day.<ref name=Coulthard268/><ref name=Breen63>Breen 1994, p. 63.</ref> Meanwhile the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217.<ref name=ONeill195/> The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. The high ground to the northwest of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital.<ref name=Breen65>Breen 1994, p. 65.</ref> Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north.<ref name=Coulthard268/> As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base, thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.<ref name=Breen65/>

At 0700 on 6 October 9 Platoon C Company<U+2014>under the command of Lieutenant Arthur Pembroke<U+2014>moved forward to Sierra in order to expand the Australian defensive position, using the heavy mist to conceal their movements.<ref name=Breen63/> Under-strength and not expecting it to be occupied, instead the Australians found a large number of Chinese in well prepared defensive positions. Without fire support, and despite being outnumbered, the Australians immediately conducted a quick attack, and using grenades and [[bayonet]]s they inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese before forcing the survivors to withdraw.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 64.</ref> Although subjected to constant shelling, 9 Platoon continued to hold the knoll, repelling several counter-attacks over the next 13 hours, cutting down each assault through the tree-line and long grass with accurate rifle and machine gun fire before the Chinese withdrew leaving their dead and wounded behind. One Australian was killed in the initial assault on Sierra, while a number were later wounded during the defence. Chinese casualties included 19 killed, 30 wounded and seven captured. Pembroke was later awarded the [[Military Cross]].<ref name=ONeill195/>

During the day the Fusiliers again assaulted Hill 217 from the south, and attempted to work their way around the eastern and western flanks of the feature.<ref name=Breen66>Breen 1994, p. 66.</ref> Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their [[Vickers machine gun]]s in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make much progress due to Chinese machine guns located in bunkers at the top of their objective. Meanwhile, flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades.<ref name=ONeill195/> 1RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Weakened, the Chinese then launched their own an assault against the Fusiliers, forcing them to withdraw while in contact.<ref name=Breen66/> Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required.<ref name=Breen65/> Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective.<ref group=note> 1RNF was overdue for rotation and many now felt they had done their share of the fighting. Indeed the battalion was the last of the original 29th Brigade battalion, with the other two already having been replaced by fresh battalions from Hong Kong and Great Britain. See Breen 1994, p. 66.</ref> It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day; B Company was subsequently allocated the attack.<ref name=ONeill195/> In preparation, B Company ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.<ref name=ONeill195/><ref name=Breen67>Breen 1994, p. 67.</ref><ref name=Coulthard268/>

In the early hours of 7 October the artillery and mortar bombardment began, targeting Chinese positions on the Hinge.<ref name=Breen67/> Hassett moved the 3RAR tactical headquarters on to Hill 317 just before the assaulting troops stepped off the line of departure, allowing him to direct the battle from a forward position and to co-ordinate fire support.<ref name=Kuring239/> Waiting for the fog to lift so that the artillery could fire until the last safe moment, the attack finally began at 0800. B Company moved off down the ridgeline, with two-up and one-in-depth using the trees and long grass for concealment. It seemed that the Chinese had withdrawn during the night, when suddenly the lead Australian platoons were engulfed by small arms fire from their rear. A series of intense fire-fights ensued as the Australians fought back. Yet by 0920 the Hinge finally fell, with the Australians losing two killed and 20 wounded. Chinese casualties included more than 20 killed.<ref name=Breen67/><ref name=Coulthard268/> As a result of the fighting Captain Henry Nicholls and Lieutenant Jim Hughes were awarded the Military Cross, while Corporal J. Park and Corporal E.F. Bosworth were awarded the [[Military Medal]].<ref>Breen 1994, pp. 68<U+2013>69.</ref> Even as the surviving Chinese withdrew, artillery and mortar fire began to fall on the Hinge. B Company moved quickly to consolidate the position, but were hampered by the shelling, while they now faced a pressing shortage of ammunition and difficulties evacuating their casualties.<ref name=ONeill197>O'Neill 1985, p. 197.</ref><ref>Breen 1994, p. 70.</ref> 

For the remainder of the day B Company was subjected to intense indirect fire on the Hinge, as was C Company on Hill 317. The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to the Hinge to support B Company.<ref name=Horner447/>At 2000 both the Hinge and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable Chinese counter-attack. Heavy mist concealed the Chinese advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7<U+2013>8 October the Hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the front and the flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the Chinese in desperate hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=Horner447/><ref name=Breen82>Breen 1994, p. 82.</ref> The Chinese swept forward with blind courage, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire.<ref name=ONeill198>O'Neill 1985, p. 198.</ref> Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]] gunners wounded, manned the light machine gun himself, breaking up a Chinese assault wave, while controlling the fire of the men around him. Meanwhile, Sergeant R.W. Strong worked fearlessly to resupply ammunition to the forward sections. Both were awarded the Military Medal.<ref name=ONeill198/>

The intensity of the fighting had lead to a severe shortage of ammunition among the defenders, and attempts to resupply the Australians were plagued by heavy shelling. The use of captured Chinese ammunition stabilised the situation momentarily, however it lead to a large number of mechanical failures and weapon stoppages.<ref name=Breen76>Breen 1994, p. 76.</ref> One of B Company's two Vickers medium machine guns was destroyed by Chinese shelling and its ammunition belts were subsequently broken up and despersed amougn the riflemen.<ref name=ONeill198/> The evacuation of casualties was again an issue, and the Assault Pioneer Platoon<U+2014>commanded by Lieutenant Jock McCormick<U+2014>at great risk, was used as stretcher bearers and to run ammunition forward, as were a number of the other specialist platoons.<ref name=Breen76/> Their ammunition nearly exhausted, the aggressive Australians kicked to death and strangled many Chinese soldiers in brutal fighting.<ref name=Breen82/> Fearing the Australians would be overwhelmed by the persistent Chinese attacks, Taylor ordered the Borderers and Shropshires to detach their Korean porters to resupply the Australians, while a full divisional concentration of artillery was fired in support of 3RAR.<ref>Breen 1994, p. 81.</ref> Ultimately, B Company succeeded in holding their hastily constructed defensive positions throughout the night and until 0500 on the 8 October when the Chinese finally gave up.<ref name=Horner447/><ref name=Breen82/>

Having failed to shift the Australians the Chinese were forced to surrender control of Hill 217 without a fight.<ref>Horner 2008, p. 78.</ref><ref>Breen 1994, p. 85.</ref> At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences<ref name=Horner447/> and in contrast to the savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed to come forward and collect their wounded under a flag of truce.<ref name=Breen82/> The Australians had won an impressive victory but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.<ref>Kuring 2004, p. 240.</ref>

At 0900, four hours later 3RAR was subsequently relieved on Maryang San and the Hinge by the Borderers, having lost 20 killed and 104 wounded.<ref name=Coulthard268>Coulthard-Clark 2001, p. 268.</ref> Chinese casualties on Hill 317 had been severe, with 283 killed by body count alone and another 50 captured, while hundreds more were likely to have been killed and wounded.<ref name=Coulthard268/> Later it was estimated that the Australians had destroyed at least two Chinese battalions during the five day battle.<ref name=ONeill199/> 1RNF once more advanced against Hill 217, this time without opposition, sending patrols to confirm that the Chinese had withdrawn. The feature was latter occupied on 9 October by the Borderers.<ref name=ONeill199/> They were met by patrols from KOSB on the Hinge with the Borderers taking control of the area at 1100.<ref name=Horner447/> The 3RAR Assault Pioneer Platoon, the Anti-Tank Platoon and a platoon from C Company remained on Maryang San however, and during the evening of 8<U+2013>9 October the Pioneers had killed four Chinese during a probe on their position. They were finally relieved on 9 October.<ref>Breen 1994, pp. 84<U+2013>85.</ref> For his leadership, Hassett was immediately awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]], while a number of awards were also made to others that had distinguished themselves during the fighting.<ref name=Horner73/><ref group=note>Total Australian decorations included two DSOs, nine [[Military Cross|MC]]s, one [[Member of the British Empire|MBE]], two [[Distinguished Conduct Medal|DCM]]s, nine [[Military Medal|MM]]s, and fifteen [[Mentioned in Dispatches]]. See Horner 2008, p. 73.</ref> The [[Royal Australian Regiment]] was subsequently granted the [[battle honour]]s "Kowang-San" and "Maryang San".<ref>Horner 1990, p. 444.</ref><ref group=note>Originally the Royal Australian Regiment was awarded the honour "Kowang-San" and this honour acknowledged the regiment<U+2019>s involvement in actions from 3<U+2013>9 October 1951 that resulted in the capture of the Kowang-San area, including the fighting at Maryang San.

"Maryang San" was also subsequently awarded to the King<U+2019>s Own Scottish Borders and the [[Royal Leicestershire Regiment]] for their actions in early-November during the loss and subsequent attempts to regain the feature.

The logistic system proved robust enough to bear the strain of the fighting without serious disruption, although problems were experienced.<ref name=ONeill199>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 199.</ref> Despite difficulties an adequate flow of ammunition, equipment, food and water was maintained, although there were occasions when the Australians had to endure thirst and hunger for several hours. 3RAR used 900,000 rounds of small arms, 5,000 grenades and 7,000 mortar rounds during the five day battle and all of this was moved in man packable loads by the [[Korean Service Corps]] porters and Australian soldiers over long distances and extreme terrain, often while under fire.<ref name=ONeill199/> These resupply operations had required considerable effort and bravery to effect, and a number of Korean porters were killed at Maryang San.<ref>Breen, 1994, p. 73.</ref> Indeed the evacuation of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters on a number of occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition.<ref name=ONeill197/> Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provide by the South African mustangs, had been important throughout.<ref name=ONeill199/>

Operation Commando finally ended on 15 October with the [[I Corps (United States)|U.S. I Corps]] having successfully seized the Jamestown Line and destroying elements of the [[42nd Army (People's Republic of China)|42nd]], [[47th Army (People's Republic of China)|47th]], 64th and [[65th Army (People's Republic of China)|65th Chinese Armies]].<ref>Hermes 1966, p. 99.</ref> Chinese losses were estimated at 21,000 casualties, while UN losses were 4,000<U+2014>the majority of them in US 1st Cavalry Division which had borne the brunt of the fighting.<ref>Johnston 2003, pp. 170<U+2013>171.</ref> Although a few hills south of the line remained in communist hands<U+2014>requiring a follow-up operation known as [[Operation Polecharge]] which succeeded in capturing these positions by 19 October<U+2014>UN supply lines near [[Seoul]] were now free from Chinese interdiction.<ref name=Johnston170>Johnston 2003, p. 170.</ref><ref>Hermes 1966, p. 101.</ref> 
With the peace-talks ongoing, these operations proved to be last actions in the war of manoeuvre, which had lasted sixteen months. It was replaced by a static war characterised by fixed defences, trench lines, bunkers, patrols, wiring parties and minefields reminiscent of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915<U+2013>1917. Construction of defensive localities began almost immediately, although such operations were confined to the [[reverse slope]]s during the day due to artillery and mortar fire which made such operations hazardous.<ref name=Horner73/> Patrolling forward of the Jamestown Line also began in order to prevent the Chinese from gaining control of [[no mans land]].<ref>O<U+2019>Neill 1985, p. 201.</ref> Yet even as the war became a contest of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]], growing western political sensitivities ensured that UN commanders were increasingly mindful of limiting casualties.<ref>Malkasian 2002, pp. 141<U+2013>148.</ref><ref>MacDonald 1986, pp. 124<U+2013>125.</ref>

[[File:Australian casualties Operation Commando Oct 1951 (AWM HOBJ2443).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Australian casualties being evacuated during [[Operation Commando (1951)|Operation Commando]], October 1951]]

Total casualties among the 1st Commonwealth Division during Operation Commando amounted to 58 killed and 262 wounded,<ref name=Johnston169>Johnston 2003, p. 169.</ref> the bulk of which had occurred during the fighting for Hill 217 and 317. Indeed, in addition to the heavy casualties suffered by 3RAR, the 1RNF had lost 16 killed and 94 wounded.<ref name=Johnston169/><ref group=note>The KOSBs and KSLI together lost 28 killed and 83 wounded during their attacks on Hill 355 and 227. In contrast the Canadians had completed the operation relatively unscathed, losing 4 killed and 28 wounded after the Chinese withdrew prior to their assault. Two New Zealand gunners were also killed by Chinese counter-battery fire.
