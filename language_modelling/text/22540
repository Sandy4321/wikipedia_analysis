The '''Revolutionary Internationalist Contingent''' was a [[Maoism|Maoist]] group in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], founded in 1986 after the failure of the [[Nottingham Communist Group]] and [[Stockport Communist Group]] to form a united organisation by means of a programme commission. The basic programmatic document of the group was ''Break the Chains!''.

Internationally, the group was aligned with the [[Revolutionary Internationalist Movement]].
