The '''Hongshan culture''' ({{zh|s=<U+7EA2><U+5C71><U+6587><U+5316>|t=<U+7D05><U+5C71><U+6587><U+5316>|p=h<U+00F3>ngsh<U+0101>n w<U+00E9>nhu<U+00E0>}}) was a [[Neolithic]] culture in northeastern [[China]]. Hongshan sites have been found in an area stretching from [[Inner Mongolia]] to [[Liaoning]] and [[Hebei]], and dated from about [[4700 BC]] to [[2900 BC]]. <ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_chron.shtm] Timeline posted by National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.</ref>

The culture is named after Hongshanhou ({{zh|s=<U+7EA2><U+5C71><U+5F8C>|t=<U+7D05><U+5C71><U+5F8C>|p=h<U+00F3>ngsh<U+0101>nh<U+00F2>u}}), a site in Hongshan District, Hongshan District, [[Chifeng]]. The Hongshanhou site was discovered by the Japanese archaeologist [[Torii Ry<U+016B>z<U+014D>]] in 1908 and extensively excavated in 1935 by Hamada Kosaku and Mizuno Seiichi. 

==Jade==
Hongshan burial artifacts include some of the earliest known examples of [[jade]] working; the Hongshan culture is known for its jade [[pig dragon]]s. embryo dragons. The embryo dragon amulets <U+2013> the first examples of the omnipresent dragon in Chinese art <U+2013> are also a combination of the baby dragon and the ancient <U+201C>Bi<U+201D> symbol<U+201D>, the jade disc with a hole in the center, that represents Heaven <U+2013> the entire universe <U+2013> and a way to communicate with it.
Clay figurines, including figurines of pregnant women, are also found throughout Hongshan sites.

==Copper==
Small copper rings were excavated.<ref>[http://www.thejadetrade.com/ian/p1b.html Hongshan Culture - The Jade Trade]</ref>

==Religion==
The archaeological site at [[Niuheliang]] is a unique ritual complex associated with the Hongshan culture.

Excavators have discovered an underground [[temple]] complex -- which included an [[altar]] -- and also [[cairn]]s in [[Niuheliang]].<ref name="Niuheliang">Please refer to [[Niuheliang]].</ref>  The temple was constructed of stone platforms, with painted walls.<ref name="Niuheliang" />  Archaeologists have given it the name ''Goddess Temple'' due to the discovery of a clay female head with [[jade]] inlaid eyes.<ref name="Niuheliang" />  It was an underground structure, 1m deep.<ref name="UNESCO">[http://whc.unesco.org/pg_friendly_print.cfm?id=141&cid=326&] UNESCO State Bureau of Cultural Relics.</ref>  Included on its walls are mural paintings.<ref name="UNESCO" />

Housed inside the ''Goddess Temple'' are clay [[figurine]]s as large as three times the size of real-life humans.<ref name="Niuheliang" />  The exceedingly large figurines are possibly [[Deity|deities]], but for a [[religion]] not reflective in any other [[Ancient China|Chinese]] culture.<ref name="Hongshan">[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl01.htm] Article by National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.</ref>

The existence of complex trading networks and monumental architecture (such as [[pyramid]]s and the ''Goddess Temple'') point to the existence of a "[[chiefdom]]"<ref name="chiefdom">[http://www.pitt.edu/~chifeng/text.html] University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: ''Regional Lifeways and Cultural Remains in the Northern Corridor:  Chifeng International Collaborative Archaeological Research Project.''  Cited references: Drennan 1995; and Earle 1987, 1997.</ref> in these [[prehistory|prehistoric]] communies.

Painted [[pottery]] was also discovered within the temple.<ref name="UNESCO" />  Over 60 nearby [[tomb]]s have been unearthed, all constructed of stone and covered by stone mounds, frequently including [[jade]] artifacts.<ref>[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_preh.shtm] ''Exhibition Brochure,'' National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.</ref>

[[Cairn]]s were discovered atop two nearby two hills, with either round or square stepped tombs, made of piled limestone.  Entombed inside were sculptures of [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]s and [[tortoise]]s.<ref name="UNESCO" />

It has been suggested that religious sacrifice might have been performed within the Hongshan culture.<ref name="UNESCO" />

==Feng shui==
Just as suggested by evidence found at early [[Yangshao culture]] sites, Hongshan culture sites also provide the earliest evidence for [[Feng shui]].<ref name="Feng shui">Please refer to [[Feng shui]].</ref>  The presence of both round and square shapes at Hongshan culture ceremonial centers suggests an early presence of the gaitian cosmography (heaven-round, earth-square).<ref>[http://portfolio.du.edu/portfolio/getportfoliofile?uid=38863] Sarah M. Nelson, Rachel A. Matson, Rachel M. Roberts, Chris Rock and Robert E. Stencel: ''Archaeoastronomical Evidence for Wuism at the Hongshan Site of Niuheliang,'' 2006.</ref> 

Early [[Feng shui]] relied on astronomy to find correlations between humans and the universe.<ref>Sun, X. (2000) Crossing the Boundaries between Heaven and Man: Astronomy in Ancient China. In H. Selin (ed.), ''Astronomy Across Cultures: The History of Non-Western Astronomy.'' 423-454. Kluwer Academic.</ref> 

==Relationship with Chinese Civilization==
Some Chinese archaeologists, such as Guo Da-shun, sees the Hongshan culture as 'the dawn of Chinese civilization' and attempts to link it with early Chinese civilization <ref>Da-Shun, Guo 1995. Hongshan and related cultures. In: The archaeology of Northeast China: beyond the Great Wall. Nelson, Sarah M. ed. 21-64. London and New York: Routledge.</ref>. However, the historical linguist Robert Blench believes that there is no evidence that this region would have been Sinitic-speaking at this period, and that it is more likely that the region would have been populated by Altaic, especially pre-Mongolic or Koreanic speakers<ref>[http://www.rogerblench.info/Language%20data/China/Geneva%20paper%202004%20submit.pdf]Roger Blench(2008), Stratification in the peopling of China: how far does the linguistic evidence match genetics and
archaeology?, p7.</ref>. Whatever the linguistic affinity of the ancient denizens, it is generally accepted that Hongshan culture has had an influence on the development of early Chinese civilization <ref>Allan, Sarah (ed), The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective</ref>.
