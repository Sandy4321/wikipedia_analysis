'''USS ''Olympia'' (C-6/CA-15/CL-15/IX-40)''' is a [[protected cruiser]] which saw service in the [[United States Navy]] from her commissioning in 1895 until 1922. This vessel became famous as the [[flagship]] of [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] during the [[Spanish-American War]] in 1898. The ship was decommissioned after returning to the United States in 1899, but was returned to active service in 1902.

She served until World War I as a training ship for naval cadets and as a floating barracks in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1917, she was mobilized again for war service, patrolling the American coast and escorting transport ships.

Following the end of World War I, ''Olympia'' participated in the [[Allied intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1919, and conducted cruises in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas to promote peace in the unstable Balkan countries.  In 1921, the ship carried the remains of the First World War's Unknown Soldier from France to Washington, DC, where his body was interred in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. ''Olympia'' was decommissioned for the last time in December 1922 and placed in reserve.

In 1957 the US Navy ceded title to the Cruiser ''Olympia'' Association, which restored the ship to its 1898 configuration.  Since then ''Olympia'' has been a [[museum ship]] in [[Philadelphia]] [[Pennsylvania]], which now part of the [[Independence Seaport Museum]].  It is the oldest steel warship still afloat.<ref name=scrapping>{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g0PsoOuekQ1t95NIPVkKHKwR8LYgD9I294EO0|title=Olympia, 2-war naval veteran, battles for survival|author=Joann Loviglio|date=6 September 2010 |work= |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>  However, the Museum, has been unable to fund essential maintenance for the old ship, and attempts to secure outside funding have failed.

{{As of|2010}} ''Olympia''{{'}}s future was uncertain; the museum may have to sell the ship for scrap or sink her as an artificial reef.

==Background==
When the first [[Cleveland Administration]] came to power in 1885, [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[William Collins Whitney]], continued the naval modernization program started during the previous [[Chester A. Arthur|Arthur Administration]]. U.S. naval policy at this time was focused on [[commerce raiding]], which implied a defensive role on the part of the United States.<ref>Friedman (1984), p. 22&ndash;23</ref>

In 1887, Whitney authorized the construction of two [[Coastal defence ship|coastal defense]] [[battleship]]s, which were to become {{USS|Texas|1892|2}} and {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|2}}.<ref name=Fbb23>Friedman (1985), p. 23</ref> The emphasis was still primarily on large and fast commerce raiding cruisers, capable of destroying an attacking [[Naval fleet|fleet]]'s supply line. President [[Grover Cleveland]] was defeated in the [[United States presidential election, 1888|election of 1888]], but before he left office, Whitney managed to have [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorize two additional cruisers. One of these was a large, 5,300-ton protected cruiser, which was to become ''Olympia''.<ref>Friedman (1984), p. 27</ref>

Starting in 1887, the new Secretary of the Navy, [[Benjamin Tracy]], began to rethink naval policy. Although Tracy allowed the [[Naval architecture|design]] and [[Shipbuilding|construction]] of ''Olympia'' to continue, he was a follower of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. As such, Tracy advocated a battle fleet capable of engaging enemy fleets in their home waters.<ref name=Fbb23/> This meant a move away from large, fast, commerce-raiding cruisers. As a result, ''Olympia'', which would probably have been the first in a large [[Ship class|class]] of ships, was the only one of her type built.<ref>Friedman (1984) p. 29</ref>

==Design and construction==
The newly formed Board on the Design of Ships began the design process for Cruiser Number 6 in 1889.<ref>Cooling, p. 11</ref>  Eight inch guns were chosen as the main armament, though the number and arrangement of these weapons as well as the armor scheme were heavily debated.  On 8 April 1890, the Navy solicited bids but found only one bidder, the [[Union Iron Works]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref>Cooling, p. 12</ref> The contract specified a cost of $1,796,000, completion by 1 April 1893, and offered a bonus for early completion .<ref>Cooling, pp. 12&ndash;13</ref>

During the contract negotiations Union Iron Works was granted permission to lengthen the vessel by {{convert|10|ft|m|1}}, at no extra cost, to accommodate the propulsion system.  The contract was signed on 10 July 1890,<ref>Cooling, p. 13</ref> the keel was [[keel|laid down]] on 17 June 1891, and ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 5 November 1892,<ref name=Conways>Gardiner, Chesneau, & Kolesnik, p. 152</ref> However, delays in the delivery of components including the new [[Harvey steel]] armor, slowed completion.<ref>Cooling, p. 18&ndash;21</ref> The last 1-pounder gun wasn't delivered until December 1894.<ref>Cooling, p. 26</ref> 

Union Iron Works conducted the first round of trials on 3 November 1893; on a {{convert|68|nmi}} run, the ship achieved a speed of {{convert|21.26|kn}}. Upon return to harbor, however, it was discovered that the [[keel]] had been fouled by [[sea grass]], which required dry-docking to fix.<ref name=C24>Cooling, p. 24</ref>

By 11 December, the work had been completed and she was dispatched from [[San Francisco]] to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] for an official speed trial. Once in the harbor, heavy fog delayed the ship for four days. On the 15th, ''Olympia'' sailed into the [[Santa Barbara Channel]], the "chosen race-track for California-built cruisers,"<ref name="Harpers1894">{{Cite journal|last=Wiggins|first=Marcus P|title=The Cruiser "Olympia"|journal=[[Harper's Weekly]]|date=3 February 1894|volume=38|page=112}}</ref> and began a four-hour time trial. According to the navy, she had sustained an average speed of {{convert|21.67|kn}},<ref name="Harpers1894"/> though she reached up to {{convert|22.2|kn}}<ref name=C24/>&mdash;both well above the contract requirement for 20&nbsp;knots.<ref name="Harpers1894"/> While returning to San Francisco, ''Olympia'' participated in eight experiments which tested various combinations of steering a ship by rudder and propellers.<ref name="Harpers1894"/> The new cruiser was ultimately commissioned on 5 February 1895.<ref name=Conways/> For several months afterwords, she was the largest ship ever built on the western coast of the United States, until surpassed by the battleship {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}.<ref>Cooling, p. 14</ref>

''Scientific American'' compared ''Olympia'' to the similar British {{Sclass|Eclipse|cruiser|1}}s and the Chilean [[Chilean cruiser Blanco Encalada|''Blanco Encalada'']] and found that the American ship held a "great superiority" over the British ships. While the ''Eclipse''s had {{convert|550|LT|t}} of coal, compared to ''Olympia''{{'}}s {{convert|400|LT|t}}, the latter had nearly double the horsepower (making the ship faster), more armor, and a heavier armament on a displacement that was only {{convert|200|LT|t}} greater than the other.<ref name="Scientific American">{{Cite journal|title=The United States Protected Cruiser Olympia|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=21 March 1896|volume=74|pages=177&ndash;78}}</ref>

===Characteristics===
[[File:USS Olympia.png|thumb|right|''Olympia'' circa 1901]]
The ship is {{convert|344|ft|1|in|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|in overall length]], has a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|53|ft|m|sp=us|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|21|ft|6|in|m|sp=us|1}}. Her design displacement was {{convert|5865|MT|sp=us|lk=on}}, with a full combat load of up to {{convert|6558|MT|sp=us}} displacement. The ship is powered by a pair of vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s, supplied with steam from three coal-fired cylindrical boilers each. Her engines were rated at {{convert|13500|ihp|lk=on}} with a top speed of {{convert|20|kn|lk=on}}, though on trials she achieved {{convert|17313|ihp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of 21.67 knots. 

''Olympia'' is armed with a variety of weapons. The primary armament is four {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}} 35-caliber guns in two twin Mark 6 [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft of the [[superstructure]].<ref name=Conways/> These guns could fire 260&nbsp;lb (118&nbsp;kg) projectiles, either armor-piercing or high explosive,  at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 2,100&nbsp;feet per second (640&nbsp;m/s). The Mark 6 turret was designed for depression of the guns to <U+2212>4<U+00B0> and elevation to 13<U+00B0>.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiGiulian|first=Tony|title=United States of America 8"/35 (20.3 cm) Marks 3 and 4 8"/40 (20.3 cm) Mark 5|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_8-35_mk3.htm|publisher=Navweaps.com |date=4 June 2008|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>

==Service history==
Upon commissioning in February 1895, ''Olympia'' departed the Union Iron Works yard in San Francisco and steamed inland to the US Navy's [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] at Vallejo, where outfitting was completed and Captain John J. Read was placed in command.<ref>Cooling, p. 28</ref> In April, the ship steamed south to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to participate in a festival.  The ship's crew also conducted landing drills in [[Sausalito]] and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] that month. On 20 April, the ship conducted its first gunnery practice, during which one of the ship's gunners, Coxswain John Johnson, was killed in an accident with one of the 5&nbsp;inch guns.<ref>Cooling, p. 29</ref> The ship's last shakedown cruise took place on 27 July.<ref>Cooling, p. 31</ref> After returning to Mare Island, the ship was assigned to replace {{USS|Baltimore|C-3|2}} as the [[flagship]] of the [[Asiatic Squadron]].<ref name=C32>Cooling, p. 32</ref>

On 25 August 1895, the ship departed the United States for Chinese waters.<ref name=C32/> A week later, the ship arrived in Hawaii, where she remained until 23 October due to an outbreak of [[cholera]]. The ship then sailed for [[Yokohama]], Japan, where she arrived on 9 November.<ref>Cooling, pp. 33&ndash;35</ref> On 15 November, ''Baltimore'' arrived in Yokohama from [[Shanghai]], China, to transfer command of the Asiatic Squadron to ''Olympia''. ''Baltimore'' departed on 3 December; Rear Admiral F.V. McNair arrived fifteen days later to take command of the squadron.<ref>Cooling, p. 36</ref> The following two years were filled with training exercises with the other members of the Asiatic Squadron, and goodwill visits to various ports in Asia.<ref>Cooling, pp. 37&ndash;49</ref> On 3 January 1898, [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] raised his flag on ''Olympia'' and assumed command of the squadron.<ref name=DANFS/>

===Spanish-American War===
{{Main|Spanish-American War}}
As tensions increased and war with Spain became more probable, ''Olympia'' remained at Hong Kong and was prepared for action. When war was declared on 25 April 1898, Dewey moved his ships to Mirs Bay, China. Two days later, the Navy Department ordered the Squadron to [[Manila]] in the Philippines, where a significant Spanish naval force protected the harbor.<ref name=DANFS/> Dewey was ordered to sink or capture the Spanish warships, opening the way for a subsequent conquest by US forces.<ref name=C1>Cooling, p. 1</ref>

====Battle of Manila Bay====
{{Main|Battle of Manila Bay}}
[[File:uss olympia manila.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Olympia'' at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]].]]
On the morning of 1 May 1898, Commodore Dewey, with his flag aboard ''Olympia'', steamed his ships into Manila Bay to confront the Spanish flotilla commanded by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Patricio Montojo y Pasar<U+00F3>n]].<ref name=C1/> The Spanish ships were anchored close to shore, under the protection of coastal artillery, but both the ships and shore batteries were outdated.<ref>Cooling, pp. 1&ndash;2</ref> At approximately 05:40, Dewey instructed ''Olympia''{{'}}s captain, "You may fire when you are ready, Gridley".<ref name=C2>Cooling, p. 2</ref> Gridley ordered the forward 8-inch gun turret, commanded by Gunners Mate Adolph Nilsson, to open fire, which opened the battle and prompted the other American warships to begin firing.<ref name=C2/><ref>Burr, p. 37</ref>

Though shooting was poor from both sides, the Spanish gunners were even less prepared than the Americans. As a result, the battle quickly became one-sided. After initial success, Dewey briefly broke off the engagement at around 07:30 when his flagship ran low on 5&nbsp;inch ammunition. This turned out to be an erroneous report - the 5-inch magazines were still mostly full.  He ordered the battle resumed shortly after 11:15. By early afternoon, Dewey had completed the destruction of Montojo's squadron and the shore batteries, while his own ships were largely undamaged. Dewey anchored his ships off Manila and accepted the surrender of the city.<ref name=C2/>

Word of Dewey's victory quickly reached the United States; both he and ''Olympia'' became famous as the first victors of the war. An expeditionary force was assembled and sent to complete the conquest of the Philippines.<ref name=C4>Cooling, p. 4</ref> ''Olympia'' remained in the area and supported the Army by shelling Spanish forces on land. She returned to the Chinese coast on 20 May 1899. She remained there until the following month, when she departed for the United States, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the Mediterranean Sea. The ship arrived in Boston on 10 October.<ref name=DANFS>{{cite web|title=Olympia|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/o2/olympia.htm|date=|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> Following ''Olympia''{{'}}s return to the United States, her officers and crews were feted and she was herself repainted and adorned with a gilded bow ornament.<ref name=C4/> On 9 November, ''Olympia'' was decommissioned and placed in reserve.<ref name=DANFS/>

===Post-war service===
''Olympia'' was recommissioned into the fleet in January 1902 and assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron. Her first duty was to serve as the flagship of the Caribbean Division. Over the following four years, the ship patrolled the Atlantic and Mediterranean;<ref name=DANFS/> her voyages included a visit to Turkey.<ref name=MM>Miller & Miller, p. 180</ref> Starting on 2 April 1906, she became a training ship for naval cadets from the [[United States Naval Academy]]. In this role, she conducted three summer training cruises: 15 May &ndash; 26 August 1907, 1 June &ndash; 1 September 1908, and 14 May &ndash; 28 August 1909. Between the cruises, the ship was placed in reserve, first in [[Norfolk]], Virginia and later at [[Annapolis]], Maryland. On 6 March 1912, ''Olympia'' arrived in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name=DANFS/> Here she served as a barracks ship until 1916.<ref name=Conways/> In late 1916, the ship was recommissioned into the fleet, when it became increasingly clear that the United States would eventually join the fighting in World War I.<ref name=DANFS/>

===World War I===
After the United States joined [[World War I]] in April 1917, ''Olympia'' was mobilized as the flagship of the US Patrol Force. She was tasked with patrolling the eastern seaboard of the United States for German warships. She also escorted transport ships in the North Atlantic.<ref name=MM/> On June 15, 1917 she ran aground on [[Long Island Sound]], and was put in for repairs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, which, along with the replacement of her four inch guns with five inch guns, took eight months.<ref>Burr, p. 41</ref> ''Olympia'' departed Charleston on 28 April 1918 carrying an expeditionary force bound for Russia. Russia, which had previously been a member of the Allied Powers, was in the midst of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and had signed a separate peace with Germany.<ref name=DANFS/> On 9 June 1918, the ship arrived in [[Murmansk]], Russia, and deployed the peace-keeping force.<ref name=MM/> She subsequently assisted in the occupation of [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]].<ref name=DANFS/>

After the end of the war, ''Olympia'' sailed to the Mediterranean via [[Portsmouth]], England.<ref name=DANFS/> In December 1918, the ship became the flagship for American naval forces stationed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. While on this assignment, she continued in her old role of showing the flag and conducting goodwill visits in various Mediterranean ports.<ref name=MM/> This included a period of policing duty in the [[Adriatic Sea]] from 21 January to 25 October 1919; the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]] was in a state of turmoil following the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the end of the war. On 18 August she steamed to the [[Black Sea]] to aid the return of refugees from the Balkans who had fled during the war. She was back in the Adriatic by 19 September, and four days later had to deploy a landing party to prevent an incident between Italian and Yugoslav forces.<ref name=DANFS/>

''Olympia'' briefly returned to Charleston on 24 November 1919.<ref name=DANFS/> The following year she was reclassified as CA-15.<ref name=DANFS2>{{cite web|title=USS Olympia (Cruiser # 6, C-6, later CA-15, CL-15, and IX-40), 1895-1957|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-o/c6.htm|date=10 October 1998|accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref> She then prepared for another tour of duty in the Adriatic, departing from New York on 14 February 1920. This was concluded on 25 May 1921, when the ship returned to Charleston. A month after her arrival she was made the flagship of the training unit for the Atlantic Fleet. She then participated in the joint Army-Navy experiments in July, during which the ex-German warships {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}} and {{SMS|Frankfurt||2}} were sunk off the [[Virginia Capes]].<ref name=DANFS/> She was again reclassified as CL-15 that year.<ref name=DANFS2/>

On 3 October 1921 Olympia departed Philadelphia for [[Le Havre]], France, to bring the remains of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns#The Unknown of World War I|Unknown Soldier]] home for interment in Arlington National Cemetery. The cruiser departed France on 25 October 1921; she was escorted by a group of French destroyers for part of the voyage. At the mouth of the Potomac river on 9 November, the battleship {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}} and the destroyer {{USS|Bernadou|DD-153|2}} joined ''Olympia'' as she sailed to the Washington Navy Yard. After transferring the remains to shore, ''Olympia'' fired her guns in salute. ''Olympia'' conducted a last training cruise for midshipmen in the summer of 1922.

==Preservation of ''Olympia''==
On 9 December 1922, she was decommissioned for the last time in [[Philadelphia]] and placed in reserve. On 30 June 1931, the ship was reclassified as IX-40.,<ref name=DANFS/> to be preserved as a [[relic]]. 

On 11 September 1957, she was released to the Cruiser ''Olympia'' Association, modified back to her 1898 configuration and became a [[museum ship]] under their auspices.   In January 1996, when faced with mounting debt and tremendous deferred maintenances, the Cruiser ''Olympia'' Society merged with the [[Independence Seaport Museum]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. 

Today, ''Olympia'' is a museum at the [[Independence Seaport Museum]], at [[Penn's Landing]] in Philadelphia. She is the sole floating survivor of the US Navy's Spanish-American War fleet. [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps]] Midshipmen from [[Villanova University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] regularly work on ''Olympia'', functioning as maintenance crew.

The museum is no longer able to fund the preservation costs for ''Olympia''. Historic steel-hulled ships should be drydocked for maintenance every twenty years, but ''Olympia'' has been in the water continuously since 1945. Essential repairs are estimated at $10 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=SOS!

Plans to scuttle the ''Olympia'' making her into an artificial reef are under consideration .<ref name=scrapping/> An independent non-profit corporation known as the [http://www.cruiserolympia.org/ Friends of the Cruiser Olympia]  was recently organized with the goal of preserving ''Olympia''.

A recent Yahoo Group was formed to help give out information about the ''Olympia'''s immediate need (olympia_preservation). A national effort is needed to save her and to date no leadership has come forward. The US Navy has dropped the ''Olympia'' from budget requests year after year. 

The Independence Seaport Museum is seeking another non-profit organization to take over the ship and provide for her maintenance and restoration, but no such organization has been found. The US Navy has expressed its willingness to let the museum "responsibly dispose" of the vessel. This could result in the ship being transferred, sold as scrap, or sunk as a reef. 

Plans were made to close ''Olympia'' to visitors on November 22, 2010, due to the poor material condition of the ship and a lack of operating funds.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g0PsoOuekQ1t95NIPVkKHKwR8LYgD9I294EO0 ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> These plans were scrapped, and Independence Seaport Museum agreed to keep the ship open with regular hours through 31 December, and then reduced hours through 31 March 2011.<ref name="philly1">{{cite web|title=Spanish-American warship spared, at least for now|publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] (The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) |date=18 November 2010|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/home_region/20101118_Spanish-American_warship_spared__at_least_for_now.html |accessdate=2010-11-18}}</ref> The museum will hold a summit in early 2011 with the Navy, Navy Sea Systems Command, National Park Service, and the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission, to determine what steps can be taken to save the cruiser.<ref name="philly1"/>

Beginning in December 2010 the Navy Yard Association of Mare Island has initiated an effort to bring this national asset back home to the San Francisco Bay Area. Possible display sites include the former National Maritime Museum Association, which operates the USS PAMPANITO SS383 at Pier 45 in San Francisco; Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, where two drydocks have been set aside as a Heritage Park to include ship displays; Mare Island<U+2019>s historic Dry Dock 1, which is envisioned for historic ship displays in planning documents; and the San Francisco Maritime Park, run by the National Park Service with over 4 million visitors/year.

On March 6, 2011, Independence Seaport Museum in Philadelphia published a Transfer Application (TAPP) similar to a Request for Proposals.  The museum is publicly seeking new stewardship of the USS ''Olympia''.  By publishing a TAPP, applications for moving the ship to a new location can be received by domestic governmental organizations or not for profit organizations with valid 501 (c) 3 IRS status.  There will be several organizations submitting applications to preserve and display the USS ''Olympia''. Applications are expected from East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast locations.<ref>{{cite web|author=By JOANN LOVIGLIO , Associated Press |url=http://www.startribune.com/nation/117548438.html |title=Museum seeks new owner for USS Olympia, historic 19th-century warship docked in Philadelphia |publisher=StarTribune.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

Effective May 7, 2011, the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) set up a national donation repository to allow for donations received through it to be used directly for the much needed temporary hull repairs and for future permanent repairs.  The Independence Seaport Museum, although it is committed to giving up the vessel,  will manage any repair work undertaken (funds permitting). See:  http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/northeast-region/the-uss-olympia.html  for more information and how to donate. The NTHP will not provide publicity support to generate donations, however, it will be up to individuals to get out the word.
