'''''The Frighteners''''' is a 1996 New Zealand-American [[horror comedy]] [[fantasy]] film directed by [[Peter Jackson]] and co-written with his wife, [[Fran Walsh]]. The film stars [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Trini Alvarado]], [[Peter Dobson]], [[John Astin]], [[Dee Wallace|Dee Wallace Stone]], [[Jeffrey Combs]], and [[Jake Busey]]. ''The Frighteners'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with [[ghost]]s after his wife's murder. He initially uses his new abilities to work with various spirits to cheat money out of customers for his "ghosthunting" business. However, the spirit of a [[mass murder]]er appears able to attack the living and the dead, posing as the ghost of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence.

Jackson and Walsh conceived the idea for ''The Frighteners'' during the script-writing phase of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''. [[Robert Zemeckis]] hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing ''The Frighteners'' as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film of the television series, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]''. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by [[Universal Studios]]. The visual effects were created by Jackson's [[Weta Digital]], which had only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.

Despite a rushed [[post-production]] schedule, Universal was so impressed with Jackson's [[rough cut]] on ''The Frighteners'', the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months. The film was not a [[box office]] success, but received generally positive reviews from critics. Despite its lackluster performance at the box office, the film has gained a [[cult following]] in more recent years, and was listed on Den of Geek's list of the [http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/1996/27957/the-top-25-underappreciated-films-of-1996 25 Most Underappreciated Films of 1996].

''The Frighteners'' is also Fox's last leading role in a live-action feature film; Fox then went on to a four-year run on the television series ''[[Spin City]]'' before semi-retiring in 2000 due to the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]].

==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->
In 1990, architect Frank Bannister loses his wife Debra in a car accident. He gives up his profession, letting his unfinished "dream house" sit incomplete for years. Following the accident, Frank gains the power to see [[ghost]]s and befriends three: 1970s gangster Cyrus, 1950s nerd Stuart, and the Judge, a gunslinger from the Old West. The ghosts haunt houses in the area to accumulate work for Frank's ghostbusting business; Frank then "exorcises" the houses for a fee. Most locals see him as a [[Confidence trick|con man]].

Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey and his wife Lucy, a [[physician]]. Ray dies of a heart attack not long after. An encounter with his ghost leads Frank to discover that an entity representing himself as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] is killing people and marking numbers on their foreheads that only the psychic can see. Frank's wife Debra had a similar number when she was found.

Because Frank can see the numbers ahead of time, he can foretell the murders, but this puts him under suspicion with the police, even Sheriff Walt Perry, who is usually patient with Frank. He calls in [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Milton Dammers. Highly paranoid, obsessive, and disturbed from years of undercover work, Dammers is convinced that Frank is psychically responsible for the killings. Frank is captured and detained after the town's newspaper editor-in-chief Magda Rees-Jones is killed <U+2013> she has previously published articles attacking him. During the confusion of the arrest, the Judge "dies" when he tries to protect Frank from the Grim Reaper.

Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper. She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail, but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart, who are both dissolved in the process. Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper. Lucy helps Frank have a [[near-death experience]] by putting him into [[hypothermia]] and using [[barbiturate]]s to stop his heart. Dammers abducts Lucy revealing that he had been a victim of [[Charles Manson]] and [[Spahn Ranch#The Manson Family|his "Family" in 1969]].

In his ghostly form, Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed 12 people about 32 years earlier, before being captured, convicted, and executed. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to [[Hell]].

Patricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins. Dammers throws the ashes away, releasing Bartlett's ghost again before Patricia kills him. Bartlett's ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. Frank realizes that Bartlett's ghost, with Patricia's help, was responsible for his wife's death and the number on her brow.

Out of bullets, Patricia strangles Frank to death, but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia's spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricia's ghost, while Frank makes it to [[Heaven]], where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart along with his wife Debra. Bartlett and Patricia's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives, but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic looking appearance, and they are both dragged to Hell by a giant [[worm]]-like creature. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body, as Debra's spirit tells him to "be happy."

Frank and Lucy fall in love. Lucy is now able to see ghosts as well. Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy while the ghost of Dammers is riding around in the sheriff's car. Frank and Lucy then enjoy their picnic.

==Cast==
* [[Michael J. Fox]] as Frank Bannister: Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned ''The Frighteners'' as a low-budget film with unknown actors, Zemeckis suggested casting his ''[[Back to the Future (series)|Back to the Future]]'' star Fox in the lead role.

==Development==
[[Peter Jackson]] and wife/co-writer [[Fran Walsh]] conceived the idea for ''The Frighteners'' in 1992, during the script-writing phase of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''.<ref name=Bob/> Together, they wrote a three-page [[film treatment]] and sent it to their [[talent agent]] in Hollywood. [[Robert Zemeckis]] viewed their treatment with the intention of directing ''The Frighteners'' as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film of the television series, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (which he helped produce).<ref name=blood>{{cite news | author = Helms, Michael | title = The Frighteners | work = [[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] | date = July 1996 | pages = 35<U+2013>41 | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}</ref><ref name=better/> Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993.<ref name=biography>{{cite book | author= Sibley, Brian | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | year =2006 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 | location = London | pages= 261, 303<U+2013>322, 331<U+2013>333 | authorlink = Brian Sibley}}</ref> The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for ''The Frighteners'' in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided ''The Frighteners'' would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref name=better>Sibley, p.273-279</ref> Universal [[greenlight]]ed the film to commence [[pre-production]] on a $26 million budget in April 1994.<ref name=Bob>Pryor, p.191-195</ref><ref name=market>Sibley, p.330-339</ref> The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]].<ref name=blood/>

===Production===
Jackson decided to film ''The Frighteners'' entirely in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news | author = Archerd, Amy | title = Cates thinks diverse noms make for good TV | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862643 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1995-02-15 | accessdate = 2008-12-24 | authorlink = Army Archerd}}</ref> Zemeckis and Universal agreed on the condition that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=camp/> [[Principal photography]] began on May 14, 1995 and lasted until November 16, which is one of the longest [[shooting schedule]]s ever approved by Universal Pictures. Six weeks into the shoot, [[cinematographer]] [[Alun Bollinger]] had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of the shoot.<ref name=long>Pryor, p.201-203</ref> [[Location shooting]] primarily included [[Wellington]] and three weeks spent in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]. Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in [[Miramar, New Zealand|Miramar]].<ref name=camp>Pryor, p.196-200</ref>

===Visual effects===
Jackson's [[Weta Digital]] created the visual effects, which included [[computer-generated imagery]], as well as [[scale model]]s (which were necessary to make [[Wellington]] look American),<ref name=biography/> [[prosthetic makeup]] and practical effects with help from [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Visual effects supervisor]] [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] explained that effects work on ''The Frighteners'' was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with [[physical effects]]. With so many ghosts among its main cast, ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company that had been in existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing ''The Frighteners'' was largely stressful.<ref name=long/> Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital.<ref name=biography/> [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by [[John Astin]] (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''.<ref name=long/> Makeup artist Brian Penikas ([[Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' trilogy]], ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'') fulfilled Baker's duties.<ref name=Indy>{{cite news | author = Vaz, Mark Cota | title = ''The Frighteners'': The Thrill of the Haunt | work = [[Cinefex]] | date = June 1996 | pages = 67<U+2013>71 | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}</ref>

The extended shooting schedule owed much to the fact that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a [[Chroma key|blue screen]]. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen photography]]. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air.<ref name=long/> The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], which went through many transformations before finding physical form.<ref name=Indy/> "We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod [[puppet]], maybe shooting it in a water tank," Jackson commented. "We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds."<ref name=long/> Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using [[computer animation]] would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called "the Gatekeeper", a winged [[cherub]] who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the [[final cut privilege|final cut]].<ref name=Japan>Sibley, p.320-329</ref>

With digital effects work running behind schedule, Zemeckis convinced Wes Takahashi (from [[George Lucas]]' [[Industrial Light & Magic]]) to help work on ''The Frighteners''.<ref name=Japan/> "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," Takahashi reflected, "but there were still about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried."<ref name=stress/> Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, trying to work out whether ''The Frighteners'' could be finished in time. "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money."<ref name=stress/> The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise.<ref name=stress/> Instead, ''The Frighteners'' received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US). [[Andrew Adamson]] was hired as a digital effects supervisor.<ref>Pryor, pp. 300-309</ref>

==Release==
The original release date was October 31, 1996, but after Universal [[studio executive]]s viewed a [[rough cut]] of ''The Frighteners'', they were impressed enough to move the release date to their "summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] slot" on July 19, 1996.<ref name=shop>{{cite news | author = Thompson, Anne | title = Little Shop of Horror | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293602,00.html | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1996-08-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-24 | authorlink = Anne Thompson (film critic)}}</ref> In addition, Universal offered the filmmaker the opportunity to make ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', which was not released until 2005.<ref>Sibley, p.210-319</ref> Jackson often disputed over the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) over the film's rating. Aware that he was meant to be delivering Universal a PG-13 rating, Jackson tried his best to omit the amount of [[graphic violence]] as much as possible, but the MPAA still believed ''The Frighteners'' deserved an R rating.<ref name=fright>Pryor, p.206-211</ref>

===Box office===
''The Frighteners'' was released in the United States in 1,675 theaters, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend.

And I just thought how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" Jackson acknowledged ''The Frighteners''{{'}} tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.<ref name=biography/>

===Critical reception===
[[File:Peter Jackson01.jpg|right|thumb|Jackson received two [[Saturn Award]] nominations.]]
''The Frighteners'' received generally positive reviews from film critics. As of June 2014, 64% of the 36 reviewers selected by review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a positive review, certifying it "Fresh" with an average score of 6.2/10; the consensus states: "Boasting top-notch special effects and exuberant direction from Peter Jackson, ''The Frighteners'' is visually striking but tonally uneven."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frighteners/|title=The Frighteners|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster|accessdate=June 8, 2014}}</ref>
