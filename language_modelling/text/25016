'''Wine''' is an [[alcoholic beverage]] made from [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] [[grape]]s or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of [[sugar]]s, [[acid]]s, [[enzyme]]s, water, or other [[nutrient]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Vintage: The Story of Wine |last=Johnson |first=H. |year=1989 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=0-671-79182-6 |pages=11<U+2013>6 }}</ref> [[Yeast in winemaking|Yeast consumes the sugars]] in the grapes and converts them into [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, [[terroir]] and subsequent [[appellation]], along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.

Wines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, [[rice wine]], [[pomegranate]] wine, [[Apfelwein|apple wine]] and [[elderberry wine]]) and are generically called [[fruit wine]]. The term "wine" can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified beverages having higher alcohol content, such as [[barley wine]], [[huangjiu]], or [[sake]].

Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred {{c.|6000}}&nbsp;BC in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name=indie>{{cite news |first=David |last=Keys |title=Now that's what you call a real vintage: professor unearths 8,000-year-old wine |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20111005120059/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/now-thats-what-you-call-a-real-vintage-professor-unearths-8000yearold-wine-577863.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 December 2003 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=archaeology96>{{cite journal |first=Mark |last=Berkowitz |title=World's Earliest Wine |url=http://www.archaeology.org/9609/newsbriefs/wine.html |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |journal=Archaeology |volume=49 |issue=5 |year=1996 |accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Cultures of The World Georgia|last1=Spilling |first1=Michael |last2=Wong |first2=Winnie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-7614-3033-9 |page=128 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> It had reached the [[Balkans]] by {{c.|4500}}&nbsp;BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient [[ancient Greece and wine|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome and wine|Rome]]. 

From its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. [[Red wine]] was closely associated with [[blood]] by the [[ancient Egyptians]], who, according to [[Plutarch]], avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC [[Saite dynasty]], "thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html | title = Isis & Osiris | publisher = University of Chicago}}</ref> The [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[cult of Dionysus|cult]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries|mysteries]] of [[Dionysus]], carried on by the [[ancient Romans|Romans]] in their [[Bacchanalia]], were the origins of western [[theater]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Word for Wine in European languages.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map showing the word for wine in European languages.]]
The English word "wine" comes from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''*winam'', an early borrowing from the [[Latin]] ''vinum'', "wine" or "(grape) [[vine]]", itself derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] stem ''*win-o-'' (cf. [[Hittite language|Hittite]]: ''wiyana''; [[Lycian language|Lycian]]: ''oino''; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|<U+03BF><U+1F36><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>}} ''oinos''; [[Aeolic Greek]]: {{lang|grc|<U+03DD><U+03BF><U+1FD6><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>}} ''woinos'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harper |first=Douglas |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=wine |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |year=2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Whiter |first=Walter |encyclopedia=Etymologicon Magnum, Or Universal Etymological Dictionary, on a New Plan |title=Wine |url=http://books.google.com/?id=SRPVgBfSrdMC&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=foinos+wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |year=1800 |publisher=Francis Hodson |pages=145}}</ref>

The earliest attested terms referring to wine are the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''me-thu-os ne-wo'' ({{lang|grc|<U+03BC><U+03AD><U+03B8><U+03C5><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03BD><U+03AD><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}), meaning "the month of new wine" or "festival of the new wine", and ''wo-no-wa-ti-si'', meaning "wine garden", written in [[Linear B]] inscriptions.<ref>[http://archive.is/20120630174743/http://projectsx.dartmouth.edu/history/bronze_age/lessons/les/26.html Mycenaean and Late Cycladic Religion and Religious Architecture], Dartmouth College</ref><ref>T.G.

Some scholars have noted the similarities between the words for wine in [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] (e.g. '''[[Georgian (language)|Georgian]]''' [[wiktionary:<U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DC><U+10DD>|<U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DC><U+10DD>]] {{IPA-ka|<U+0263>vin<U+0254>|}}), [[Indo-European languages]] (e.g. [[Russian language|Russian]] ''<U+0432><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E>'' {{IPA-ru|vino|}}), and [[Semitic]] (''*wayn''), pointing to the possibility of a common origin of the word denoting "wine" in these language families.<ref>Benjamin W. Fortson IV ''Indo-European Language and Culture, an introduction'', Blackwell Publishing 2010, p. 42, on [http://books.google.com/books?id=_kn5c5dJmNUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Indo-European+language+and+culture:+an+introduction&hl=en&ei=N82PTcjkMo24sAOvw9mQCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wine&f=false Google books]</ref> Some scholars have argued that Georgian was the origin of this word and that it entered into the Indo-European languages via Semitic.<ref>[http://www.kartvelian.org/en/projects/mikeladze_totem_ameskhi_review.html Center for Research of Kartvelian Civilization]</ref> The proponents of this view have argued that in Kartvelian languages the semantic connection of the word "wine"  (<U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DC><U+10DD> - ghvino, <U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DC><U+10D8> - ghvini, <U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DC><U+10D0><U+10DA> - ghvinal) is traced to the verb "ghvivili" (<U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10DA><U+10D8>, to bloom, to arouse, to boil, to ferment) and the root of "ghv" (<U+10E6><U+10D5>), which is a common semantic root for many common Kartvelian words (e.g. "gaghvidzeba", <U+10D2><U+10D0><U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10EB><U+10D4><U+10D1><U+10D0> - to awaken, "ghvidzli" - <U+10E6><U+10D5><U+10D8><U+10EB><U+10DA><U+10D8> - liver).

[[Fruit wine|Wines from other fruits]], such as apples and berries, are usually named after the fruit from which they are produced combined with the word "wine" (for example, [[Apfelwein|apple wine]] and [[elderberry wine]]) and are generically called [[fruit wine]] or country wine (not to be confused with the [[French language|French]] term ''[[vin de pays]]''). Besides the grape [[variety (botany)|varieties]] traditionally used for [[winemaking]], most fruits naturally lack either a high amount of fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.

Other wines, such as [[barley wine]] and [[rice wine]] (e.g. [[sake]]), are made from starch-based materials and resemble [[beer]]  more than wine, while [[ginger wine]] is fortified with [[brandy]]. In these latter cases, the term "wine" refers to the similarity in alcohol content rather than to the production process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avbc.com/news/BW.html |title=Barley Wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |last=Allen |first=Fal |publisher=Anderson Valley Brewing Company |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227015623/http://www.avbc.com/news/BW.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 February 2008}}</ref> The commercial use of the [[England|English]] word "wine" (and its equivalent in other languages) is protected by law in many jurisdictions.<ref name="Wine Label decoder">{{cite book |last=George |first=Rosemary |title=The Simon & Schuster Pocket Wine Label Decoder |year=1991 |publisher=Fireside |isbn=978-0-671-72897-7}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Banquet Louvre G133.jpg|thumb|Wine boy at a [[symposium]]]]
{{Main|History of wine}}
Archaeological evidence has established the earliest-known production of wine from fermenting grapes during the late [[Neolithic]] or early [[Chalcolithic]] in the [[Caucasus]] and the northern edge of the [[Middle East]].

A 2003 report by [[archaeologist]]s indicates a possibility that grapes were mixed with [[rice]] to produce mixed fermented beverages in [[China]] in the early years of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the [[Neolithic]] site of [[Jiahu]], [[Henan]], contained traces of [[tartaric acid]] and other organic compounds commonly found in wine.

The spread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the [[Phoenicians]] who spread outward from a base of [[city-state]]s along the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] and [[Israel]]i coast.<ref>McGovern, Patrick E. 2003.

Literary references to wine are abundant in [[Homer]] (8th century BC, but possibly relating earlier compositions), [[Alkman]] (7th century BC), and others. In [[ancient Egypt]], six of 36 wine [[amphora]]s were found in the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]] bearing the name "Kha'y", a royal chief [[vintner]].

==Grape varieties==
[[File:Grape Vineyard.jpg|thumb|right|Grape vineyard]]
{{Main|List of grape varieties}}

Wine is usually made from one or more [[Variety (biology)|varieties]] of the European [[species]] ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'', such as [[Pinot noir]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Gamay]] and [[Merlot]]. When one of these varieties is used as the predominant grape (usually defined by law as minimums of 75% to 85%), the result is a "[[varietal]]" as opposed to a "blended" wine. Blended wines are not considered inferior to varietal wines, rather they are a different style of winemaking; some of the world's most highly regarded wines, from regions like [[Bordeaux]] and the [[Rhone Valley]], are blended from different grape varieties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Wine can also be made from other species of grape or from [[Hybrid (grapes)|hybrids]], created by the [[genetic crossing (vine)|genetic crossing]] of two species. ''[[Vitis labrusca|V. labrusca]]'' (of which the [[Concord grape]] is a [[cultivar]]), ''[[Vitis aestivalis|V. aestivalis]]'', ''[[Vitis rupestris|V. ruprestris]]'', ''[[Vitis rotundifolia|V. rotundifolia]]'' and ''[[Vitis riparia|V. riparia]]'' are native [[North America]]n grapes usually grown to eat fresh or for grape juice, jam, or jelly, and only occasionally made into wine.

Hybridization is different from [[grafting]]. Most of the world's vineyards are planted with European ''V. vinifera'' vines that have been grafted onto North American species' rootstock, a common practice due to their resistance to [[phylloxera]], a root louse that eventually kills the vine. In the late 19th century, most of Europe's vineyards (excluding some of the driest in the south) were devastated by the infestation, leading to widespread vine deaths and eventual replanting. Grafting is done in every wine-producing region in the world except in [[Argentina]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Chile]]&mdash;the only places not yet exposed to the insect.<ref name="Robinson pg 97">{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course: A Guide to the World of Wine |date=28 April 2006 |publisher=Abbeville Press |isbn=978-0-7892-0883-5 |page=97}}</ref>

In the context of wine production, ''[[terroir]]'' is a concept that encompasses the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the [[aroma (wine)|aroma]] and taste influences of their unique ''terroir''.<ref name="Johnson & Robinson pg 22-23">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |coauthors=Jancis Robinson |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |pages=22<U+2013>23}}</ref> However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market [[table wine]] or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production techniques such as [[micro-oxygenation]], tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film evaporation,
and spinning cones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winegeeks.com/articles/85 |title=High Alcohol is a Wine Fault... Not a Badge of Honor |accessdate=25 June 2008 |last=Citriglia |first=Matthew |date=14 May 2006 |publisher=GeekSpeak, LLC}}</ref>

==Classification==
[[File:Wine grapes03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wine grapes on a vine]]
{{Main|Classification of wine}}
Regulations govern the classification and sale of wine in many regions of the world. European wines tend to be classified by region (e.g. [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]] and [[Chianti]]), while non-European wines are most often classified by grape (e.g. [[Pinot noir]] and [[Merlot]]). Market recognition of particular regions has recently been leading to their increased prominence on non-European wine labels. Examples of recognized non-European locales include [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]] and [[Sonoma Valley AVA|Sonoma Valley]] in [[California (wine)|California]]; [[Willamette Valley (wine)|Willamette Valley]] in [[Oregon (wine)|Oregon]]; [[Columbia Valley (wine)|Columbia Valley]] in [[Washington (wine)|Washington]]; [[Barossa Valley (wine)|Barossa Valley]] in [[South Australia (wine)|South Australia]] and [[Hunter Valley (wine)|Hunter Valley]] in [[New South Wales (wine)|New South Wales]]; Luj<U+00E1>n de Cuyo in [[Argentina (wine)|Argentina]]; Central Valley in [[Chile (wine)|Chile]]; Vale dos Vinhedos in [[Brazil]]; [[Hawke's Bay]] and [[Marlborough, New Zealand|Marlborough]] in [[New Zealand (wine)|New Zealand]]; and [[Okanagan Valley (wine)|Okanagan Valley]] and [[Niagara Peninsula]] in [[Canada (wine)|Canada]].

Some blended wine names are marketing terms whose use is governed by [[trademark]] law rather than by specific wine laws. For example, [[Meritage]] (sounds like "heritage") is generally a Bordeaux-style blend of [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and Merlot, but may also include [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit Verdot]], and [[Malbec]]. Commercial use of the term Meritage is allowed only via licensing agreements with the Meritage Association.

==Vintages==
{{Main|Vintage}}
A "vintage wine" is made from grapes that were all or mostly grown in a particular year, and labeled as such. Some countries allow a vintage wine to include a small portion that is not from the labeled vintage. Variations in a wine's character from year to year can include subtle differences in color, palate, nose, body and development. High-quality wines can improve in flavor with age if properly stored.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |title=wine |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106005/wine |accessdate=25 June 2008 |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online}}</ref> Consequently, it is not uncommon for wine enthusiasts and traders to save bottles of an especially good vintage wine for future consumption.

In the [[United States]], for a wine to be vintage-dated and labeled with a country of origin or [[American Viticultural Area]] (AVA) (e.g. [[Sonoma Valley]]), 95% of its volume must be from grapes harvested in that year.<ref name="27 CFR 4.27">[[Title 27 of the United States Code]], [[Code of Federal Regulations]] [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=33fc0c0194b58b6fe95208945b5c637a&rgn=div5&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.2&idno=27#27:1.0.1.1.2.3.25.8 <U+00A7>4.27]</ref> If a wine is not labeled with a country of origin or AVA the percentage requirement is lowered to 85%.<ref name="27 CFR 4.27"/>

Vintage wines are generally bottled in a single batch so that each bottle will have a similar taste. Climate's impact on the character of a wine can be significant enough to cause different vintages from the same vineyard to vary dramatically in flavor and quality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frenchscout.com/wine-vintages |title=Wine vintages, vintage charts |accessdate=26 June 2008 |last=Breton |first=F<U+00E9>licien |publisher=French Scout}}</ref> Thus, vintage wines are produced to be individually characteristic of the particular vintage and to serve as the flagship wines of the producer. Superior vintages from reputable producers and regions will often command much higher prices than their average ones. Some vintage wines (e.g. [[Brunello di Montalcino|Brunello]]), are only made in better-than-average years.

For consistency, non-vintage wines can be blended from more than one vintage, which helps winemakers sustain a reliable market image and maintain sales even in bad years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Clive |last=Platman |title=Wine: Lovely bubbly |date=2 October 2002 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BPOC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F671027250245CB&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 |work =[[Birmingham Post]] |accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |year=2006 |month=May |title=Change to Vintage Date Requirements (2005R-212P) |journal=[[Federal Register]] |volume=71 |issue=84 |url=http://regulations.justia.com/view/43285/ |accessdate=26 June 2008 |page=25748 |author=Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau}}</ref> One recent study suggests that for the average wine drinker, the vintage year may not be as significant for perceived quality as had been thought, although wine connoisseurs continue to place great importance on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liquidasset.com/WEILVDQS.PDF |format=PDF|title=Parker v.

==Tasting==
[[File:Tempranillowine.jpg|thumb|Judging [[wine color|color]] is the first step in tasting a wine.]]
{{Main|Wine tasting}}
{{See also|Wine tasting descriptors}}
[[Wine tasting]] is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. Wines contain many chemical compounds similar or identical to those in fruits, vegetables, and [[spice]]s. The [[sweetness of wine]] is determined by the amount of residual sugar in the wine after fermentation, relative to the acidity present in the wine. [[Dry wine]], for example, has only a small amount of residual sugar.

Some wine labels suggest opening the bottle and letting the wine "breathe" for a couple of hours before serving, while others recommend drinking it immediately. [[Decanter|Decanting]] (the act of pouring a wine into a special container just for breathing) is a controversial subject among wine enthusiasts. In addition to aeration, decanting with a filter allows the removal of bitter sediments that may have formed in the wine. Sediment is more common in older bottles, but aeration may benefit younger wines.<ref name="Johnson & Robinson pg 46">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |coauthors=Jancis Robinson |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |page=46}}</ref>

During aeration, a younger wine's exposure to air often "relaxes" the drink, making it smoother and better integrated in aroma, texture, and flavor. Older wines generally "fade" (lose their character and flavor intensity) with extended aeration.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fruity character and breathing times | date=18 September 2005 | publisher= | url =http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:KLSC&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10CBABDF8E627AD8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 | work =[[New Straits Times]] | pages = | accessdate =24 October 2007 | language = }}</ref> Despite these general rules, breathing does not necessarily benefit all wines. Wine may be tasted as soon as the bottle is opened to determine how long it should be aerated, if at all.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

When tasting wine, individual flavors may also be detected, due to the complex mix of organic molecules (e.g. [[ester]]s and [[terpene]]s) that grape juice and wine can contain. Experienced tasters can distinguish between flavors characteristic of a specific grape and flavors that result from other factors in winemaking. Typical intentional flavor elements in wine<U+2014>chocolate, vanilla, or coffee<U+2014>are those imparted by aging in oak casks rather than the grape itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frenchscout.com/types-of-wine |title=Types of wine |accessdate=26 June 2008 |last=Breton |first=F<U+00E9>licien |publisher=French Scout}}</ref>

[[Wine_tasting#Vertical_and_horizontal_tasting|Vertical and horizontal tasting]] involves a range of vintages within the same grape and vineyard, or the latter in which there is one vintage from multiple vineyards.

Banana flavors ([[isoamyl acetate]]) are the product of yeast metabolism, as are spoilage aromas such as sweaty, barnyard, band-aid ([[4-Ethylphenol|4-ethylphenol]] and [[4-ethylguaiacol]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=193 |title=''Brettanomyces'' Monitoring by Analysis of 4-ethylphenol and 4-ethylguaiacol |accessdate=26 June 2008 |author=ETS Laboratories |date=15 March 2001}}</ref> and rotten egg ([[hydrogen sulfide]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etslabs.com/scripts/ets/pagetemplate/blank.asp?pageid=350 |title=Sulfides in Wine |accessdate=26 June 2008 |author=ETS Laboratories |date=15 May 2002}}</ref> Some varietals can also exhibit a mineral flavor due to the presence of water-soluble salts as a result of limestone's presence in the vineyard's soil.

Wine aroma comes from volatile compounds released into the air.<ref>{{cite journal |last=G<U+00F3>mez-M<U+00ED>guez |first=M. Jos<U+00E9> |coauthors=Manuela G<U+00F3>mez-M<U+00ED>gueza, Isabel M. Vicarioa and Francisco J. Heredia |year=2007 |month=April |title=Assessment of colour and aroma in white wines vinifications: Effects of grape maturity and soil type |journal=Journal of Food Engineering |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=758<U+2013>764 |doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.02.038 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T8J-4JWFGMW-2/2/23595bac8aab73913dd9b4aed36bb8c9 |accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> Vaporization of these compounds can be accelerated by twirling the wine glass or serving at room temperature. Many drinkers prefer to chill red wines that are already highly aromatic, like [[Chinon AOC|Chinon]] and [[Beaujolais]].<ref name="Johnson & Robinson pg 44-45">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |coauthors=Jancis Robinson |title=The World Atlas of Wine |date=13 September 2001 |publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=978-1-84000-332-1 |pages=44<U+2013>45}}</ref>

The ideal temperature for serving a particular wine is a matter of debate, but some broad guidelines have emerged that will generally enhance the experience of tasting certain common wines. A white wine should foster a sense of coolness, achieved by serving at "cellar temperature" (55<U+00B0>F/13<U+00B0>C). Light red wines drunk young should also be brought to the table at this temperature, where they will quickly rise a few degrees.  Red wines are generally perceived best when served ''chambr<U+00E9>'' ("at room temperature"). However, this does not mean the temperature of the dining room<U+2014>often around 70<U+00B0>F/21<U+00B0>C<U+2014>but rather the coolest room in the house and, therefore, always slightly cooler than the dining room itself.  Pinot noir should be brought to the table for serving at 60<U+00B0>F/16<U+00B0>C and will reach its full bouquet at 65<U+00B0>F/18<U+00B0>C. Cabernet Sauvignon, zinfandel, and Rhone varieties should be served at 65<U+00B0>F/18<U+00B0>C and allowed to warm on the table to 70<U+00B0>F/21<U+00B0>C for best aroma.<ref>{{Cite book

==Collecting==
{{See also|Aging of wine|Investment wine|Storage of wine}}
Outstanding vintages from the best vineyards may sell for thousands of [[United States dollar|dollars]] per bottle, though the broader term "fine wine" covers those typically retailing in excess of US$30<U+2013>50.<ref>For example, [[Berry Brothers & Rudd]], one of the world's largest dealers, start "fine wine" prices at about <U+00A3>25<U+2014>in March 2009 with a wine from [[Au Bon Climat]] [http://www.bbr.com/fine-wine/offers website "Fine wine offers"].</ref> "[[Investment wine]]s" are considered by some to be [[Veblen good]]s: those for which demand increases rather than decreases as their prices rise. 
Particular selections have higher value, such as "Verticals", in which a range of vintages of a specific grape and vineyard, are offered. The most notable was a [[Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27Yquem#Since_1968|Chateau d'Yquem]] 135 year vertical containing every vintage from 1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5 million.
The most common wines purchased for investment include those from [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] and [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]]; [[cult wine]]s from [[Europe]] and elsewhere; and [[Port wine|vintage port]]. Characteristics of highly collectible wines include:

#A proven track record of holding well over time
#A drinking-window plateau (i.e., the period for maturity and approachability) that is many years long
#A consensus among experts as to the quality of the wines
#Rigorous production methods at every stage, including grape selection and appropriate barrel aging

Investment in fine wine has attracted those who take advantage of their victims' relative ignorance of this wine market sector.<ref>economist.com [http://www.economist.com/node/18836894 Fine-wine fraud].</ref> Such [[wine fraud]]sters often profit by charging excessively high prices for off-vintage or lower-status wines from well-known wine regions, while claiming that they are offering a sound investment unaffected by [[economic cycle]]s. As with any investment, thorough research is essential to making an informed decision.

== Uses ==
Wine is a popular and important [[beverage]] that accompanies and enhances a wide range of [[Cuisine of Europe|European]] [[cuisine]]s, from the simple and traditional to the most sophisticated and complex. Wine is important in cuisine not just for its value as a beverage, but as a flavor agent, primarily in [[stock (food)|stock]]s and [[braising]], since its acidity lends balance to rich [[Basic taste#Savouriness|savory]] or [[sweet]] dishes. Natural wines may exhibit a broad range of alcohol content, from below 9% to above 16% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]], with most wines being in the 12.5%<U+2013>14.5% range.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jancis Robinson |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} See ''alcoholic strength'' at p. 10.</ref> Fortified wines (usually with brandy) may contain 20% alcohol or more.

== Religious significance ==
{{See also|Alcohol and religion|Kosher wine|Christianity and alcohol|Islam and alcohol}}

===Ancient religions===
The use of wine in religious ceremonies is common to many cultures and regions. [[Libation]]s often included wine, and the [[Dionysian Mysteries|religious mysteries]] of Dionysus used wine as a sacramental [[entheogen]] to induce a mind-altering state.

===Judaism===

Wine is an integral part of [[halakha|Jewish laws and traditions]]. The ''[[Kiddush]]'' is a blessing recited over wine or grape juice to sanctify the [[Shabbat]]. On Pesach ([[Passover]]) during the Seder, it is a Rabbinic obligation of adults to drink four cups of wine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/holidaya.htm |title=Pesach: Passover |last=Rich |first=Tracey R |work=Judaism 101}}</ref> In the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] and in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the libation of wine was part of the sacrificial service.<ref>{{cite book |last=Neusner |first=Jacob |title=The Halakhah: An Encyclopaedia of the Law of Judaism |publisher=BRILL |year=2000 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XThbHMAHbNAC |isbn=90-04-11617-6}}</ref> Note that this does not mean that wine is a symbol of blood, a common misconception that contributes to the Christian myth of the [[blood libel]].

:{{See also|Christianity and alcohol|Alcohol in the Bible}}

In [[Christianity]], wine is used in a sacred rite called the [[Eucharist]], which originates in the [[Gospel]] account of the [[Last Supper]] ([[Gospel of Luke]] 22:19) describing [[Jesus]] sharing bread and wine with his disciples and commanding them to "do this in remembrance of me." Beliefs about the nature of the Eucharist vary among [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (see [[Eucharistic theologies contrasted]]).

While some Christians consider the use of wine from the grape as essential for the validity of the [[sacrament]], many Protestants also allow (or require)  [[pasteurization|pasteurized]] grape juice as a substitute. Wine was used in Eucharistic rites by all Protestant groups until an alternative arose in the late 19th century. [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[dentist]] and [[prohibition]]ist [[Thomas Bramwell Welch]] applied new pasteurization techniques to stop the natural fermentation process of [[grape juice]]. Some Christians who were part of the growing [[temperance movement]] pressed for a switch from wine to grape juice, and the substitution spread quickly over much of the United States, as well as to other countries to a lesser degree.<ref>{{cite news |title=Almost Like Wine |date=3 September 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824374,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate=26 June 2008}}</ref> There remains an ongoing debate between some American [[Protestant]] denominations as to whether wine can and should be used for the Eucharist or allowed as an ordinary beverage, with Catholics and some mainline Protestants allowing wine drinking in moderation, and some conservative Protestant groups opposing consumption of alcohol altogether.

===Islam===
Alcoholic beverages, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Frances |last=Harrison |title=Alcohol fatwa sparks controversy |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7342425.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref> [[Iran]] had previously had [[Viticulture in Iran|a thriving wine industry]] that disappeared after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Tait |title=End of the vine |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/oct/12/worlddispatch.iran |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=12 October 2005 |accessdate=26 June 2008 |location=London}}</ref> In [[Greater Persia]], ''[[Persian wine|mey]]'' (Persian wine) was a central theme of [[poetry]] for more than a thousand years, long before the advent of Islam. Some [[Alevi]] sects use wine in their religious services.

Certain exceptions to the ban on alcohol apply. Alcohol derived from a source other than the grape (or its byproducts) and the date<ref>Sahih Muslim Book 043, Hadith Number 7186.</ref> is allowed in "very small quantities" (loosely defined as a quantity that does not cause intoxication) under the Sunni [[Hanafi]] ''madhab'', for specific purposes (such as medicines), where the goal is not intoxication. However, modern Hanafi scholars regard alcohol consumption as totally forbidden.<ref>[http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/perfalc.htm Alcohol based Perfumes, Deodrants and Creams, Mufti Muhammad ibn Adam, Darul Iftaa, Leicester]</ref>

Although excessive alcohol consumption has adverse health effects, [[epidemiological]] studies have consistently demonstrated that moderate consumption of alcohol and wine is [[Association (statistics)|statistically associated]] with a decrease in [[cardiovascular]] illness such as [[heart failure]].<ref name=Lindberg>{{cite journal |last= Lindberg |first= Matthew L. |coauthors= Ezra A. Amsterdam |title= Alcohol, wine, and cardiovascular health |journal= Clinical Cardiology |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=347<U+2013>51 |year=2008 |pmid=18727003 |doi=10.1002/clc.20263}}</ref> Additional news reports on the [[French Paradox|French paradox]] also back the relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Journal of Consumer Marketing |year=1994 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=17<U+2013>24 |title= The impact of media stories concerning health issues on food product sales: management planning and responses |last=Dodd |first= Tim H. |coauthors=Steve Morse |doi=10.1108/07363769410058894}}</ref>
This paradox concerns the comparatively low incidence of [[coronary heart disease]] in France despite relatively high levels of [[saturated fat]] in the traditional French diet. Some epidemiologists suspect that this difference is due to the higher consumption of wines by the French, but the scientific evidence for this theory is limited. Because the average moderate wine drinker is likely to exercise more often, to be more health conscious, and to be from a higher educational and socioeconomic background, the association between moderate wine drinking and better health may be related to [[confounding factor]]s or represent a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] rather than [[Granger cause|cause and effect]].<ref name=Lindberg/>

Population studies have observed a [[J curve|J-curve]] association between wine consumption and the risk of heart disease: heavy drinkers have an elevated risk, while moderate drinkers (up to 20g of alcohol per day, approximately {{convert|120|ml|0|abbr=on}} of 13% [[ABV]] wine) have a lower risk than non-drinkers. Studies have also found that moderate consumption of other alcoholic beverages may be cardioprotective, although the association is considerably stronger for wine.<ref>{{Cite pmid|19406740}}</ref> Additionally, some studies have found greater health benefits for red than white wine, though other studies have found no difference. Red wine contains more [[polyphenols in wine|polyphenol]]s than white wine, and these are thought to be particularly protective against cardiovascular disease.<ref name=Lindberg/>

A chemical in red wine called [[resveratrol]] has been shown to have both cardioprotective and chemoprotective effects in animal studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Olas |first=Beata |coauthors=Barbara Wachowicz, Joanna Saluk-Juszczak and Tomasz Zieli<U+0144>ski |year=2002 |month=August |title=Effect of resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic compound, on platelet activation induced by endotoxin or thrombin |journal=Thrombosis Research |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=141<U+2013>145 |url=http://www.thrombosisresearch.com/article/PIIS0049384802002736/abstract |accessdate=26 June 2008 |doi=10.1016/S0049-3848(02)00273-6}}</ref> Low doses of resveratrol in the diet of middle-aged mice has a widespread influence on the genetic factors related to aging and may confer special protection on the heart.

To benefit fully from resveratrol in wine, it is recommended to sip slowly when drinking. Due to inactivation in the gut and liver, most of the resveratrol consumed while drinking red wine does not reach the blood circulation. However, when sipping slowly, absorption via the mucous membranes in the mouth can result in up to 100 times the blood levels of resveratrol.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/06/11/hscout627934.html "Health Secrets of Red Wine Uncovered"], Forbes, 06.11.2009</ref>

Red wines from the south of France and from [[Sardinia]] in Italy have been found to have the highest levels of [[Proanthocyanidin|procyanidins]], compounds in grape seeds thought to be responsible for red wine's heart benefits. Red wines from these areas contain between two and four times as much procyanidins as other red wines tested. Procyanidins suppress the synthesis of a peptide called [[endothelin-1]] that constricts blood vessels.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Oenology: Red wine procyanidins and vascular health |journal=Nature |date= |first=R. |last=Corder |coauthors=W.

A 2007 study found that both red and white wines are effective antibacterial agents against strains of ''[[Streptococcus]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Antibacterial Activity of Red and White Wine against Oral Streptococci|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |year=2007 |first=M. |last=Daglia |coauthors=A.

Retrieved 7 October 2008.</ref>

While evidence from laboratory and [[epidemiological]] (observational) studies suggest a cardioprotective effect, no controlled studies have been completed on the effect of alcoholic beverages on the risk of developing heart disease or stroke. Excessive consumption of alcohol can cause [[cirrhosis]] of the liver and [[alcoholism]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/quickstats/general_info.htm |title=General Information on Alcohol Use and Health |accessdate=26 June 2008 |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref> the [[American Heart Association]] cautions people to "consult your doctor on the benefits and risks of consuming alcohol in moderation."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4422 |title=Alcohol, Wine and Cardiovascular Disease |accessdate=26 June 2008 |author=American Heart Association}}</ref>

Sulfites in wine can cause some people, particularly those with [[asthma]], to have adverse reactions. [[Sulfite]]s are present in all wines and are formed as a natural product of the fermentation process; many winemakers add [[sulfur dioxide]] in order to help preserve wine. Sulfur dioxide is also added to foods such as dried [[apricot]]s and [[orange juice]]. The level of added sulfites varies; some wines have been marketed with low sulfite content.<ref>[http://www.winesofcanada.com/larchhill2.html Ageing and Storing Wines], Wines of Canada.

Incidents of fraud, such as mislabeling the origin or quality of wines, have resulted in regulations on labeling. "Wine scandals" that have received media attention include:
* The [[1985 Diethylene Glycol Wine Scandal]], in which [[diethylene glycol]] was used as a sweetener in some Austrian wines.
* [[Wine fraud#Hazardous materials|In 1986]], [[methanol]] (a toxic type of alcohol) was used to alter certain wines manufactured in [[Italy]].

{{See also|Cork (material)|Closure (bottle)|Alternative wine closures|Wine bottle|Box wine|Screw cap (wine)}}

Most wines are sold in [[wine bottle|glass bottles]] and sealed with [[cork (material)|corks]] (50% of which come from [[Portugal]]).<ref>J. L. CALHEIROS E MENESES, President, Junta Nacional da Corti<U+00E7>a, Portugal. [http://www.uwec.edu/Geography/Ivogeler/Travel/Portugal/cork-article2.htm "The cork industry in Portugal"]</ref> An increasing number of wine producers have been using [[Alternative wine closures|alternative closures]] such as [[Screw cap (wine)|screwcaps]] and synthetic [[plastic]] "corks". Although alternative closures are less expensive and prevent [[cork taint]], they have been blamed for such problems as excessive [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Some wines are packaged in thick plastic bags within [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes, and are called "[[box wine]]s", or "cask wine". Tucked inside the package is a tap affixed to the [[bag in box]], or bladder, that is later extended by the consumer for serving the contents. Box wine can stay acceptably fresh for up to a month after opening because the bladder collapses as wine is dispensed, limiting contact with air and, thus, slowing the rate of oxidation. In contrast, bottled wine [[oxidize]]s more rapidly after opening because of the increasing ratio of air to wine as the contents are dispensed; it can degrade considerably in a few days.

Environmental considerations of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass used to make bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely recyclable, whereas the plastics used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] violations. A ''New York Times'' editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced [[carbon footprint]] from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. And, while a wine box is recyclable, its plastic bladder most likely is not.<ref>Muzaurieta, Annie Bell, thedailygreen.com (2008-10-01).

==Storage==
[[File:Wine Barrels.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Oak]] [[wine barrel]]s]]
{{Main|Storage of wine}}

[[Wine cellar]]s, or wine rooms, if they are above-ground, are places designed specifically for the storage and aging of wine. In an "active" wine cellar, temperature and humidity are maintained by a climate-control system. "Passive" wine cellars are not climate-controlled, and so must be carefully located. Because wine is a natural, perishable food product, all types<U+2014>including red, white, sparkling, and fortified<U+2014>can spoil when exposed to heat, light, vibration or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. When properly stored, wines can maintain their quality and in some cases improve in aroma, flavor, and complexity as they age. Some wine experts contend that the optimal temperature for aging wine is 55<U+00B0>F/13<U+00B0>C,<ref>fineliving.com [http://www.fineliving.com/fine/simply_wine/article/0,,fine_15098_2518659,00.html Storing Wine]</ref> others 59<U+00B0>F/15<U+00B0>C.<ref>maridajesgourmet.com [http://www.maridajesgourmet.com/vinos/vino/vinocuidadovino/temperatura.html Storing Wine Temperature]</ref>
Wine refrigerators offer an alternative to wine cellars and are available in capacities ranging from small, 16-bottle units to furniture-quality pieces that can contain 400 bottles. Wine refrigerators are not ideal for aging, but rather serve to chill wine to the perfect temperature for drinking.
