The '''Teesta River''' (Pron:ti:<U+02C8>st<U+0259>) or '''Tista''' ({{Lang-ne|<U+091F><U+093F><U+0937><U+094D><U+091F><U+093E>}}<ref name="Joshi2004" /> [[Hindi]] <U+091F><U+0940><U+0938><U+094D><U+0924><U+093E>) is said to be the lifeline of the [[Indian state]] of [[Sikkim]], flowing for almost the entire length of the state and carving out verdant [[Himalaya]]n temperate and tropical river valleys. The river then forms the border between Sikkim and [[West Bengal]] before joining the [[Brahmaputra]] as a tributary in [[Bangladesh]]. The total length of the river is {{convert|309|km|abbr=on}},<ref name="Bisht" /> draining an area of 12,540 km<U+00B2>. Before a large part of this was situated in [[Nepal]]. But after the [[Sugauli Treaty]] it was acceded to [[British India]].

== Course ==
The river originates from Tsolamu Lake in North Sikkim.  

The Teesta River is then fed by [[rivulet]]s which arise in the Thangu, Yumthang and Donkia-La ranges. The river then flows past the town of [[Rangpo]] where [[Rangpo River]] merges into it and where it forms the border between Sikkim and West Bengal up to [[Teesta Bazaar]]. Just before the Teesta Bridge, where the roads from [[Kalimpong]] and [[Darjeeling]] join, the river is met by its main [[tributary]], the [[Rangeet River]]. At this point, it changes course southwards flowing into West Bengal. The river hits the plains at [[Sevoke]], {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Siliguri]], where it is spanned by the [[Coronation Bridge]] which links the northeast states to the rest of [[India]]. The river then courses its way to [[Jalpaiguri]] and then to [[Rangpur District|Rangpur district]] of Bangladesh, before finally merging with the mighty Brahmaputra at Fulchori.

== Geography ==
[[File:The River Teesta.jpg|thumb|150px|Teesta River flowing across the length of [[Sikkim]] is fed by melting mountain snow and rain and meets Rangeet River at the border between Sikkim and West Bengal]]
Through its course, the Teesta river has carved out [[ravine]]s and [[gorge]]s in Sikkim meandering through the hills with the [[hill station]] of Kalimpong lying just off the river. Variegated vegetation can be seen along this route. At lower elevations, [[tropical]] [[deciduous]] trees and shrubs cover the surrounding hills; [[alpine climate|alpine vegetation]] is seen at the upper altitudes. The river is flanked by white sand which is used by the construction industry in the region. Large boulders in and around the waters make it ideal for [[rafting]] enthusiasts.

Between Rangpo town and the railway bridge (popularly called Lohapul or iron bridge) on it as it enters the plains at Sevoke, the Teesta flows with a very strong current, ideal for white river rafting. Towns like Teesta Bazaar and [[Melli]] have facilities for group rafting. Though the river looks innocuous, the underlying current is very strong. In 1915, G.P. Robertson, the then Municipal Engineer of Darjeeling, drowned after losing control of the boat in the turbulence while surveying the river. The boat struck a partially hidden boulder and was sucked in by a whirlpool, leaving no trace of the occupants.

During the [[monsoon]]s, this humble river distends its banks; both in size and turbulence. [[Landslide]]s in this region often dam up parts of the river in this season.

Great changes have taken place in the course of some of the rivers in [[Bengal]] and the adjoining areas, during the period since 1500 CE. Although positive evidence is lacking, similar changes can be assumed in the remoter past. The Teesta River is one of the rivers that has changed over the years.<ref name="Majumdar1971" />

The Teesta earlier ran due south from [[Jalpaiguri]] in three channels, namely, the [[Karatoya River|Karatoya]] to the east, the [[Punarbhaba River|Punarbhaba]] in the west and the [[Atrai River|Atrai]] in the centre. The three channels possibly gave the name to the river as ''Trisrota'' "possessed of three streams" which has been shortened and corrupted to Teesta. Of these three, the Punarbhaba joined the [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]]. The Atrai passing through a vast marshy area known as [[Chalan Beel]] joined the Karatoya and the united stream joined the [[Padma River|Padma]] (Ganges) near Jafarganj. In the destructive floods of 1787, the Teesta river forsook its old channel and rushing south-east it joined the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]].<ref name="Majumdar1971" />

[[James Rennell]] made a survey between 1764 and 1777 and his maps are one of the earliest authentic maps of Bengal in existence. In these maps Teesta is shown as flowing through North Bengal in several branches&nbsp;<U+2014> Punarbhaba, Atrai, Karatoya, etc. All these streams combined lower down with the Mahananda, now the westernmost river in North Bengal, and taking the name of Hoorsagar finally discharged into the Ganges at Jafarganj, near modern Goalundo. The Hoorsagar river is still in existence, being the combined outfall of the [[Baral river|Baral]], a spill channel of the Ganges, the Atrai, the Jamuna or Jamuneswari (not the main Jamuna through which the Brahmaputra now flows), and the Karatoya, but instead of falling into the Ganges, it falls into the main [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], a few miles above its confluence with the Padma at Goalundo.<ref name="Majumdar1941" />

== Proposed dams ==
India has proposed a series of dams within the Teesta river system that should produce some 50,000 MW of electricity within the next 10 years.<ref name="InternationalRivers" /> With some of the largest sediment loads, the creation of a reservoir will lead to an increased pressure on an active fault area. There are concerns that the building of these dams may lead to river-[[induced seismicity]]. Despite such worries the construction of the dams had started. Links are suspected between the dam construction and the deadly 2011 earthquake in Sikkim.<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/WestBengal/Sikkim-quake-may-have-been-induced-by-dams-across-Teesta/Article1-748547.aspx</ref>

== Climate and tectonics of Teesta River ==
The Teesta river has preserved good imprints of climatic and tectonics along its valleys and catchments. The significant fluvial landscape of the Teesta river has been described by few workers, e.g., Archarya, Mukhopadhyay, Malay Mukul, Ingocha Meetei Lukram. Not many international papers have been published about the Teesta river. The recent paper of Ingocha Meetei Lukram suggested that climate change, particularly on a millennial to multi-millennial scale, during late [[Quaternary]] had a strong system-wide influence on sediment production, transport and deposition in the Teesta river system (Meetei et al., 2007) <ref name="Lukram Ingocha Meetei" />

The interrelationship between climate, erosion, deposition and tectonic activities is not properly understood to date. However, it appears that major alluviation and incision events could be ascribed to the factors associated with climatic processes such as strengthening or weakening of monsoonal precipitation and related fluvial discharge. Tectonic activity affects sediment fluxes and is responsible for the insetting of younger terraces/fanlobes into the older terraces/fanlobes. During seismic events, landslide activity along the slopes of river valleys influences sediment delivery into the valleys, causing the effects of tectonics to be intricately coupled with that of climate (Meetei et al. 2007).<ref name="Lukram Ingocha Meetei" />

The terraces and floodplains, valley-side slopes and landslide slopes, alluvial cones of different generations, kettle-shaped depressions, sickle-shaped ranges, leveled plains, undulating plains and deeply dissected valleys, and glacial and periglacial deposits are some of the geomorphological features observed in the Teesta river basin in Sikkim (Mukhopadhayay, 1982). Three prominent knick points have been observed along the Teesta river profiles which correspond to the zones of tectonic discontinuities, the important ones being the MCT and MBT (e.g. Seeber and Gornitz, 1983). From the recent studies of Mukul (2000)<ref name="Mukul2000" /> and Mukul et al. (2007),<ref name="Mukul et al." /> it is proved that the southern part of the frontal wedge near the foothill zone is tectonically active along with the formation of NKT, SKT and MFT structures within the sub-Himalaya in the Teesta basin.
