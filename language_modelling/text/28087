==Early life==
Shiki, or rather Tsunenori (<U+5E38><U+898F>) as he was originally named,<ref>Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric, Louis. ''Japan encyclopedia''. Harvard University Press, 2005. ISBN 9780674017535. p613</ref> was born in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama city]] in [[Iyo province]] (present day [[Ehime prefecture]]) to a [[samurai]] class family of modest means.<ref name=birth/> As a child, he was called Tokoronosuke (<U+51E6><U+4E4B><U+52A9>); in adolescence, his name was changed to Noboru (<U+5347>).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} His father, Tsunenao,{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} was an alcoholic who died when Shiki was five years of age,<ref name=birth/> but his mother, Yae,<ref name=page27>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 27 | url =  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> was a daughter of <U+014C>hara Kanzan, a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholar.<ref name=birth/> Kanzan was the first of Shiki's extra-school tutors, and at the age of 7 the young boy began reading [[Mencius]] under his tutelage.<ref name=mencius/> Shiki later confessed to being a less-than-diligent student.<ref name=mencius>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 4  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref>

At age 15 Shiki became something of a political radical, attaching himself to the then-waning [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] and getting himself banned from public speaking by the principal of [[Matsuyama Higashi High School|Matsuyama Middle School]], which he was attending.<ref name=matsuyamamiddle>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 7-8 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Around this time he developed an interest in moving to Tokyo and did so in 1883.<ref name=scholarship1>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 8-9  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref>

==Education==
The young Shiki first attended his home-town [[Matsuyama Middle School]], where Kisama Jifuku, a leader of the discredited [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]], had recently served as principal.<ref name=matsuyamamiddle/>

In 1883, a maternal uncle arranged for Shiki to come to Tokyo,<ref name=scholarship1/> and he was first enrolled Ky<U+014D>ritsu Middle School and later matriculated into a university preparatory school (''K<U+014D>t<U+014D> Ch<U+016B>gakk<U+014D>''<ref name=bloodc/>), ''Daigaku Yobimon''.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 9  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> While studying here, the teenage Shiki enjoyed playing baseball<ref name=bball/> and befriended fellow student [[Natsume S<U+014D>seki]], who would go on to become a famous novelist.<ref>{{Cite book | coauthors = Donald H.

He entered [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in 1890.<ref name=dropout/> But by 1892 Shiki, by his own account too engrossed in haiku writing, failed his final examinations, left the [[Hong<U+014D>]] dormitory that had been provided to him by a scholarship, and dropped out of college.<ref name=dropout/> Others say tuberculosis, an illness that dogged his later life, was the reason he left school.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Kato  | first = Shuichi   | authorlink = Sh<U+016B>ichi Kat<U+014D> (critic)  | translator = Don Sanderson  | title = A History of Japanese Literature: The Modern Years  | publisher = Kodansha International  | volume = 3  | date = 1983  | location = Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco  | pages = 133  | language = English  | isbn = 0870115693}}</ref>

==Literary career==
While Shiki is best known as a haiku poet,<ref name=claimtofame/> he also wrote other genres of poetry,<ref>{{Cite book  | coauthors = Burton Watson (translator)  | title = Masaoka Shiki: selected poems  | publisher = Columbia University Press  | date = 1997  | pages = 11  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=zfk5EkyOaRMC&lpg=PP1&dq=burton%20watson%20shiki&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn = 0231110901}}</ref> prose criticism of poetry,<ref name=critic/> autobiographical prose,<ref name=critic>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 22  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> and short prose essays.<ref name=page27/> His earliest surviving work is a school essay, ''Y<U+014D>ken Setsu'' ("On Western Dogs"), where he praises the varied utility of [[Western world|western]] dogs as opposed to Japanese ones, which "only help in hunting and scare away burglars".<ref>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 5 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref>

Contemporary to Shiki was the idea that traditional Japanese poetic short forms, such as the [[haiku]] and ''[[Waka (poetry)#Tanka|tanka]]'', were waning due to their incongruity in the modern [[Meiji Period]].<ref name=bloodc>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 14 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645, 97808872736}}</ref> Shiki himself, at times, expressed similar sentiments.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Keene | first = Donald  | authorlink = Donald Keene  | title = Some Japanese Portraits  | publisher = Kodansha International   | date = 1978  | location = Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco  | pages = 200  | isbn =}0870112988}}</ref> There were no great living practitioners although these forms of poetry retained some popularity.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Keene | first = Donald  | authorlink = Donald Keene  | title = Some Japanese Portraits  | publisher = Kodansha International   | date = 1978  | location = Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco  | pages = 195-198  | isbn =}0870112988}}</ref>

Despite an atmosphere of decline, only a year or so after his 1883 arrival in Tokyo, Shiki began writing haiku.<ref name=dropout>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 15-16 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA15#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> In 1892, the same year he dropped out of university, Shiki published a [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] work advocating haiku reform, ''Dassai Shooku Haiwa'' or "Talks on Haiku from the Otter's Den".<ref name=nippon>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 18-19 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> A month after completion of this work, in November 1892, he was offered a position as haiku editor in the paper that had published it, "Nippon", and maintained a close relationship with this journal throughout his life.<ref name=nippon/> In 1895 another serial was published in the same paper, "A Text on Haikai for Beginners", ''Haikai Taiy<U+014D>''.<ref name=claimtofame>{{Citation | last = Beichman | first = Janine | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet | pages = 18-19 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> These were followed by other serials: ''Meiji Nij<U+016B>kunen no Haikukai'' or "The Haiku World of 1896" where he praised works by disciples<ref name=ito>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002 | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 27-28 | url = | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> [[Kyoshi Takahama|Takahama Kyoshi]] and Kawahigashi Hekigot<U+014D>,<ref name=buson>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 25 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> ''Haijin Buson'' or "The Haiku Poet [[Yosa Buson|Buson]]" (1896-1897<ref name=buson/>) expressing Shiki's idea of this 18th century poet whom Shiki identifies with his school of haiku,<ref name=tankaref>{{Citation | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002 | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet | pages = 26 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> and ''Utayomi ni Atauru Sho'' or "Letters to a Tanka Poet" (1898) where he urged reform of the ''[[Waka (poetry)#Tanka|tanka]]'' poetry form.<ref name=tankaref/>

The above work, on the ''tanka'', is an example of Shiki's expanded focus during the last few years of life.

==Later life==
Shiki suffered from [[tuberculosis]] (TB) much of his life. In 1888<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Keene | first = Donald  | authorlink = Donald Keene  | title = Some Japanese Portraits  | publisher = Kodansha International   | date = 1978  | location = Tokyo, New York, and San Francisco  | pages = 198  | isbn =}0870112988}}</ref>  or 1889<ref name=penname/> he began coughing up blood<ref name=bloodc/> and soon adopted the [[pen-name]] Shiki from the Japanese ''hototogisu'', which is a word usually translated as cuckoo.<ref name=penname>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 20 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> It is a Japanese conceit that this bird coughs blood as it sings,<ref name=penname/> which explains why the name "Shiki" was adopted.

Already suffering from the early symptoms of TB, Shiki sought work as a war correspondent in the [[First Sino-Japanese war]]<ref name=penname/> and, while eventually obtaining his goal, he arrived in China after the April 17, 1895, signing of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]].<ref name=sinojpn>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 21 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA21#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> Instead of reporting on the war, he spent an unpleasant time harassed by Japanese soldiers<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Rabson  | first = Steve  | title = Righteous cause or tragic folly: changing views of war in modern Japanese poetry  | publisher = the Center for Japanese Studies, the University of Michigan  | date = 1998  | location = Ann Arbor, MI  | pages = 23-26  | isbn = 0939512777}}</ref> in [[Dalian]], Luangtao, and the [[L<U+00FC>shunkou District]], meeting on 10 May 1895<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Bowring  | first = Richard John  | title = Mori <U+014C>gai and the modernization of Japanese culture  | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | series = University of Cambridge oriental publications  | volume = 28  | date = 1979  | location = London, New York, Melbourne  | pages = 175  | isbn =0521213193 }}</ref> the famous novelist [[Mori <U+014C>gai]], who was at the time an army doctor.<ref name=sinojpn/>

Living in filthy conditions in China apparently worsened his TB.<ref name=sinojpn/> Shiki continued to cough blood throughout his return voyage to Japan and was hospitalized in [[Kobe]].<ref name=sinojpn/> After being discharged, he returned to his home town of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama city]] and convalesced in the home of the famed novelist [[Natsume S<U+014D>seki]].<ref name=sinojpn/> During this time he took on disciples and promulgated a style of haiku that emphasized gaining inspiration from personal experiences of nature.<ref name=sinojpn/> Still in Matsuyama in 1897, a member of this group, Yanigihara Kyokud<U+014D>, established a haiku magazine, ''Hototogisu'',<ref name=tankaref/> an allusion to Shiki's pen name.<ref name=penname/> Operation of this magazine was quickly moved to Tokyo. Takahama Kyoshi, another disciple,<ref name=ito/> assumed control and the magazine's scope was extended to include prose work.<ref name=page27/>

Shiki also came to Tokyo,<ref>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 23 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yKqMhXgImEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=masaoka%20shiki&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false  | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> and his group of disciples there were known as the "Nippon school" after the paper of which he had been haiku editor, and which now published the group's work.<ref name=buson/>

Although already bedridden by 1897,<ref name=tankaref/> Shiki's disease worsened further around 1901.<ref name=page27/> He developed [[Pott's disease]], and began using morphine as a painkiller.<ref name=page27/> By 1902 he may have been relying heavily on the drug.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Beichman  | first = Janine  | title = Masaoka Shiki: his life and works  | publisher = Cheng & Tsui  | year = 2002  | edition = revised  | chapter = Chapter One: Life; From Samurai to Poet  | pages = 28 | url = | isbn = 0887273645}}</ref> During this time Shiki wrote three autobiographical works.<ref name=tankaref/> He died of TB in 1902 at age 35.<ref name=penname/>
