An '''oculus''', plural '''oculi''', from Latin ''oculus'': eye, denotes a circular opening in the centre of a dome or in a wall. Originating in [[Antiquity]], it is a feature of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]]. It is  also known as an ''oeil de boeuf'' from the French, or simply a "bull's-eye".<ref name=riba>[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/PalladianBritain/PalladianInteriors/PalladianPrinciples/Light/OculusWindow.aspx "Oculus window"].

==Classical origins==
The oculus was first used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], one of the finest examples being that in the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]. Open to the weather, it allows rain to enter and fall to the floor, where it is carried away through drains. Though the opening looks small, it actually has a diameter of {{convert|27|ft|abbr=on}} allowing it to light the building just as the sun lights the earth. The rain also keeps the building cool during the hot summer months.<ref>[http://atheism.about.com/od/christianchurchchurches/ig/Pantheon-Rome-Temple-Church/Photograph-Pantheon-Rome-V.htm "Oculus of the Pantheon"], About.com.

==Byzantine architecture==
The oculus was widely used in the architecture of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. It was applied to buildings in [[Syria]] in the 5th and 6th centuries and again in the 10th century. In [[Constantinople]]'s [[Bodrum Mosque|Myrelaion Church]] (c. 920), there are two oculi above the stringcourse on both lateral facades.<ref name="<U+0106>ur<U+010D>i<U+0107>Johnson2012">{{cite book|author1=Slobodan <U+0106>ur<U+010D>i<U+0107>|author2=Mark Joseph Johnson|author3=Robert G.

==Neoclassical revival==
Early examples of the oculus in [[Renaissance architecture]] can be seen in [[Florence Cathedral]], in the nave [[clerestorey]] and topping the crowns of the arcade arches.<ref>[http://arts.muohio.edu/faculty/benson/florencecathedral/ "The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence"]. Retrieved 24 January 2013.</ref> 

Since the revival of dome construction beginning in the [[Italian Renaissance]], open oculi have been replaced by light-transmitting [[cupola]]s and other round windows, openings, and [[skylight (window)|skylights]]. They can be seen in the pediments of [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Rotonda]], though not in the dome. Use of oculus windows became more popular in [[Baroque architecture]]. Widely used by [[Neo-Palladian]] architects including [[Colen Campbell]], one can be seen in the dome of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]] at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref name=riba/><ref>[http://www.arch.virginia.edu/archive/ded7y/vs98/RCstudy1.htm "Daylighting in two centroidal spaces at the University of Virginia: Case Study"], The Rotunda and Caplin Pavilion: The University of Virginia.

==Other uses==

''Oculus'', Latin for [[eye]], is also used in medicine and optics.  

In [[archaeology]], '''oculus''' is the name given to a motif found in western European [[prehistoric art]]. It consists of a pair of circular or spiral marks, often interpreted as eyes, and appears on pottery, statues and [[megalith]]s. The oculus motif may represent the watchful gaze of a god or goddess and was especially common during the [[Neolithic]] period.
