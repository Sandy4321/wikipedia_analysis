The '''''Portland''-class''' of [[heavy cruiser]]s was a [[ship class|class]] of ships designed and constructed by the [[United States Navy]] in 1930. The two ships of the class, {{USS|Portland|CA-33}} and {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35}} saw extensive service during the [[Pacific War]] in [[World War II]].

Designed as a modification over the previous [[Northampton class cruiser|''Northampton'' class cruiser]], the ''Portland'' class displaced nearly {{convert|10,000|t}} and featured heavier armor and armament that previous cruisers. Featuring [[8"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun]]s intended for shore bombardment and designed to function as fleet flagships, the ''Portland'' class were intended to fix problems with armament and armor that had been a weakness of preceeding U.S. cruisers. These designs were carried over to the following [[New Orleans class cruiser|''New Orleans'' class]], of which several ''Portland'' cruisers were converted to mid-construction.

''Portland'' served in a large number of engagements including the [[Battle of Coral Sea]], the [[Battle of Midway]] and the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], where she was severely damaged but nonetheless able to return to service. She later fought in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] and the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. ''Indianapolis'' served as a fleet flagship for much of the war and fought in the [[Battle of Philippine Sea]] and the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]]. On 30 July 1945, after transporting components for the [[nuclear weapons]] [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]] from the United States, she was torpedoed by the [[Japanese submarine I-58|Japanese submarine ''I-58'']]. Due to a series of errors and miscommunications her loss was not discovered for several days, and only 316 of her 1,116 crew survived.

== Background ==
The ''Portland'' class was the third class of heavy cruiser to be constructed by the [[United States Navy]] following the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. The first "treaty cruisers" were the two of the [[Pensacola class cruiser|''Pensacola'' class]] ordered in 1926, which emphasized armament and speed at the expense of protection. These ships were followed by the six vessels of the [[Northampton class cruiser|''Northampton'' class]] ordered in 1927 which were more heavily-armed, and introduced the configuration of three triple turrets which would become standard on U.S. Navy heavy cruisers. The ''Portland'' class was a modification of both the ''Pensacola'' and ''Northampton'' designs.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=136}} 

Ordered for the U.S. Navy in fiscal year 1930, the ''Portland'' class was originally designated as a [[light cruiser]], and given the [[hull classification symbol]] CA, being re-designated a [[heavy cruiser]] with the symbol CL on 1 July 1931,{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}} due to their armament. Originally, eight cruisers were envisioned as modified as modified ''Northampton'' class vessels, but eventually two of these became the ''Portland'' class, with the remaining six eventually being further modified into the succeeding [[New Orleans class cruiser|''New Orleans'' class]].{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=29}}

==Design==
As built, the ''Portland'' class cruisers were to be {{convert|610|ft|3|in|m}} in [[length overall]], and {{convert|592|ft}} long [[Waterline length|at the waterline]].{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}} {{convert|64|ft|6|in|m}} [[Abeam]],{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=136}} and with a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|21|ft}}, and {{convert|24|ft}} maximum. They were designed for a [[standard displacement]] of {{convert|10,258|t}}, and a [[full-load displacement]] of {{convert|12,755|t}}.{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=292}} However, neither completed ship reached this weight, displacing {{convert|9,800|t}} and {{convert|9,950|t}}, respectively.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}} The ships featured two distinctive raked funnels, a tripod [[foremast]], and a small tower and pole mast aft. In 1943, light tripods were added forward of the second funnel on each ship, and a prominent [[Naval director]] was installed aft.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}}

[[File:Portland in Sydney 1942.jpg|thumb|left|''Portland'' in drydock in [[Sidney, Australia]] in 1942]]
The ships were equipped with four [[propeller shaft (ship)|propeller shaft]]s and four Parsons GT [[geared turbine]]s and eight [[Yarrow boiler]]s. The power plant of the ships generated {{convert|107,000|shp}} and the ships had a design speed of {{convert|32|knots|km/h}} The ships were designed for a range of {{convert|10,000|nmi}} at {{convert|15|knots|km/h}}.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}} Both completed ships rolled badly until fitted with [[bilge keel]]s.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}}

The cruisers were armed with a [[Artillery battery|main battery]] of nine [[8"/55 caliber Mark 71 gun]]s arrayed in three triple mounts, a [[superfiring]] pair fore and one aft. For [[anti-aircraft]] defense, they were armed with eight [[5"/25 caliber gun (United States)|5"/25 caliber gun]]s as well as two [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss]] guns. In 1945, the anti-aircraft defenses of both ships were upgraded, with each receiving twenty four [[Bofors 40 mm]] guns. On {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}} these were arranged in four quad mounts and four twin mounts, and on {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}} they were arrayed in six quad mounts. Both ships were also upgraded with twelve [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]s.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}} No torpedo tubes were fitted on either ship of the class.{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=30}} The ships were outfitted with Mk. 8 [[rangekeeper]]s and Mk. 27 directors which also housed auxiliary Mk. VII rangekeepers.{{sfn|Baker|2008|p=200}}

The ''Portland'' class was originally armed with {{convert|1|in}} of armor for deck protection and side protection, but during construction these were substantially up-armored during construction.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}} As completed, the ships were armed with [[belt armor]] between {{convert|5|in}} (around the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]]) and {{convert|3.25|in}} and in thickness.{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=30}} Armor on the [[bulkhead]]s was between {{convert|2|in}} and {{convert|5.75|in}}, while armor on the deck was {{convert|2.5|in}}, armor on the [[barbette]]s was {{convert|1.5|in}}, armor on the [[gunhouse]]s was {{convert|2.5|in}}, and armor on the [[conning tower]] was {{convert|1.25|in}}.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}}

Additionally, the ''Portland'' class cruisers were designed with space to be outfitted as [[fleet flagship]]s, with space for an Admiral and his staff to operate. The class also featured an [[aircraft catapult]] amidships.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}} They could carry four aircraft. The total crew complement varied, with a regular designed crew complement of 807,{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=292}} a wartime complement of 952, which could increase to 1,229 when the cruiser was operating as a fleet flagship.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}}

=== Comparison with previous cruiser designs ===
The ''Portland'' class was generally longer than the ''Northampton'' class by about {{convert|10|ft}} and featured a revised bow shape. They were otherwise generally similar to the ''Northampton'' class, with an extended [[forecastle]] to improve sea-keeping abilities.{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=292}} Their masts were deduced as compared to the ''Northampton'' class in order to reduce top weight.{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=29}}

When completed, the ''Pensacola'' class displaced less than expected, at {{convert|9,100|t}},{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=136}} which was {{convert|1,000|t}} less than expected, and were found to be greatly deficient in their protection.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}} For the following ''Northampton'' class, the armor protection was increased to {{convert|1,057|t}} with {{convert|3|in}} of armor along the [[main belt]].{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=28}} Still, these ships only displaced between {{convert|9,050|t}} and {{convert|9,300|t}}{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=136}} While the ''Portland'' class cruisers were more heavily armored than the preceeding classes, this problem was found to be so significant that in fiscal year 1929, an entirely different design was formulated for a new class of cruisers, the ''New Orleans'' class. Several of the ''Portland'' hulls were then converted to ''New Orleans'' hulls during construction.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}}

The ''Portland'' class were also designed with more advanced armament in mind. Their main guns were the first to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns' range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], which until that point out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower.{{sfn|Hixon|2003|p=24}} The ''New Orleans'' class was designed with these lessons in mind, intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=32}}

== Construction ==
Five ships were ordered in fiscal year 1930, to be constructed by three builders. In 1931, [[USS New Orleans (CA-32)|CA-32]], [[USS Astoria (CA-34)|CA-34]], and [[USS Minneapolis (CA-36)|CA-36]], all ordered from Westinghouse, were converted to the ''New Orleans'' class.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}}{{sfn|Stille|2009|p=12}} ''Portland'' was laid down by [[Bethlehem Steel]] at [[Quincy Shipyard]] on 17 February 1930, and ''Indianapolis'' was laid down by [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] on 31 March 1930.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}}{{sfn|Morrison|2001|p=35}} The hull and machinery of both ships was provided by their respective builders.{{sfn|Bauer|Roberts|1991|p=138}} ''Indianapolis'' was launched first, on 7 November 1931 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 15 November 1932. ''Portland'' was launched on 21 May 1932 and commissioned on 23 February 1933.{{sfn|Silverstone|2007|p=32}}

== Ships in class ==

=== USS ''Portland'' (CA-33) ===
[[File:USS Portland (CA-33).jpg|thumb|''Portland'' off California in 1944]]
{{mainarticle|USS Portland (CA-33)}}

''Portland'' was the first ship on the scene when the [[airship]] {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|2}} went down in 1933, and coordinated efforts to retrieve survivors. She conducted a number of fleet maneuvers and goodwill missions throughout the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After the start of World War II, ''Portland'' took part in the [[Battle of Coral Sea]], there rescuing 722 survivors from the sunk [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}. She then fought at the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]],{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=334}} and in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], where she was hit by three dud air-launched [[torpedoes]].{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=292}} She then supported [[U.S. Marine]] landings during the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=334}} During the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|naval battle]] there, she was struck and severely damaged by a torpedo from a Japanese [[destroyer (ship)|destroyer]],{{sfn|Baker|2008|p=306}} a hit which required extensive repairs at [[Mare Island Navy Yard]] in late 1942.{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=292}} In spite of this damage, she was still able to inflict substantial damage on the [[Japanese battleship Hiei|Japanese battleship ''Hiei'']] that the latter ship was found and sunk the day after the battle.{{sfn|Baker|2008|p=216}}

Returning to the war, she bombarded [[Kiska]] as part of the [[Aleutian Islands campaign]], played a supporting role in the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]], covered landings during the [[New Guinea campaign]], and [[Pelelieu]]. She then participated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], covered landings in the [[Philippines]], and supported the [[Battle of Okinawa]].{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=334}} At the end of the war she was decomissioned and remained in the [[United States Reserve Fleet]] until 1959, when she was broken up for scrap.{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=335}}

=== USS ''Indianapolis'' (CA-35) ===
[[File:USS Indianapolis CA-35.jpg|thumb|''Indianapolis'' off [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1937]]
{{mainarticle|USS Indianapolis (CA-35)}}
''Indianapolis'' served as flagship of [[Scouting Force 1]] during World War II, and saw action in a number of campaigns in the Pacific theater. She supported the Gilbert and Marshall island campaigns as well as operations off the [[Caroline Islands]]. Later in the war she fought in the [[Battle of Philippine Sea]] and later the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] and participating in the Battle of Okinawa.{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=188}}

In mid-1945, she sailed from the United States to [[Tinian Island]] carrying components of [[Little Boy]] and [[Fat Man]], the two [[nuclear weapons]] which would later be used to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Sailing for [[Leyte]] unescorted under [[Captain (naval rank)|Captain]] [[Charles B. McVay III]], she was torpedoed by [[Japanese submarine I-58|Japanese submarine ''I-58'']] on 30 July 1945, sinking in just 12 minutes. An estimated 800 of her 1,119 crew survived the initial sinking, but her [[SOS signal]] was not heard, and due to a series of errors and misunderstandings, her loss was not discovered until 2 August when her crew was spotted by reconnaissance plane. Only 320 men were recovered following the sinking, of whom 316 survived. McVay survived and faced a [[court martial]] and reprimand, but later committed suicide.{{sfn|Kearns|Morris|1998|p=188}}{{sfn|Miller|2001|p=293}}
