'''Henry le Despenser''' (c. 1341<U+2013>1406) was a 14th century English nobleman and [[Bishop of Norwich]] whose reputation as the 'Fighting Bishop' was gained for his part in suppressing the [[Peasants' Revolt]] and in defeating the peasants at the [[Battle of North Walsham]] in the summer of 1381.
As a young man he studied at [[Oxford University]] and held numerous positions in the English Church. He fought in [[Italy]] before being consecrated as a [[bishop]] in 1370. Parliament agreed to allow Despenser to lead a crusade to [[Flanders]] in 1383, which was directed against [[Louis II of Flanders]], a supporter of the [[antipope Clement VII]]. The crusade was in defence of English economic and political interests. Although well funded, the expedition was poorly equipped and lacked proper military leadership. After initial successes, a disastrous attempt to besiege the city of [[Ypres]] forced Despenser to return to England. Upon his return he was [[Impeachment|impeached]] in parliament. His [[temporalities]] were confiscated by [[Richard II of England]], but were returned in 1385, the year he accompanied the king northward to repel a potential French invasion of [[Scotland]].

Despenser was an energetic and able administrator who staunchly defended his diocese against [[Lollardy]]. In [[1399]], he was among those who stood by Richard, following the landing of [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] in [[Yorkshire]] towards the end of June. He was arrested for refusing to come to terms with Bolingbroke. The following year, he was implicated in the [[Epiphany Rising]], but was [[Royal pardon|pardoned]].

==Birth and ancestry==
Henry le Despencer was the youngest son of [[Edward le Despenser]] (1310<U+2013>1342), who married Anne (d. 1367),<ref name="DNB">''DNB''</ref> 
daughter of Sir Ralph Ferrers of Groby.
Henry was born around 1342, the year that his father was killed at the siege of [[Vannes]].<ref name="DNB 1900">DNB (1900)</ref> He and his three brothers all grew up to become soldiers. His eldest brother [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]<ref>Burke, B. (1814<U+2013>1892), ''A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire'' (1869) p.670 [http://www.archive.org/details/genealogicalhera00inburk   online version]</ref> (c.1335<U+2013>1375) was reputed to be one of the greatest knights of his age: he and Henry fought together for [[Pope Urban V]] in his war against [[Milan]] in 1369.<ref name="DNB 1900"/>
Comparatively little is known of his other siblings: Hugh le Despenser fought abroad and died in [[Padua]] in March 1374, Thomas fought in France and died unmarried in 1381 and Gilbert le Despenser died in 1382. Their sister Joan was a nun at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]] until her death in 1384.<ref>Allington-Smith, p.3-4</ref>

The [[le Despenser]] family originated from the lords of [[Gomi<U+00E9>court]] in north-eastern [[France]].<ref>Allington-Smith, p.1</ref> Henry's grandmother [[Eleanor de Clare]] was a grand-daughter of [[Edward I of England]]. 

His great-grandfather [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester]] (1262<U+2013>1326) and grandfather [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]] (1286<U+2013>1326), who was a favourite of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], were both exiled and later executed after the rebellion of [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Mortimer]] against [[Edward II of England]].<ref name="14th C">[[May McKisack]], ''The Fourteenth Century 1307<U+2013>1399''</ref> 
Hugh le Despenser became Edward II's adviser, holding power until the king's defeat at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]], but he was later restored to favour. His son was appointed the king's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] and enjoyed a still larger share of royal favour.  The [[baron]]s were hostile to the Despensers, due to their acquired wealth and perceived arrogance, and in 1321 they were [[Exile|banished]].<ref>''The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 11th Edition, Volume 8, Slice 2 [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30685/30685-h/30685-h.htm On-line version]</ref> After their sentences were annulled they returned to court and from 1322 they played an important role in the governing of the country. However, in 1326 Isabella acted against them and both men were tried and executed.
Despenser's nephew [[Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester]] succeeded his father [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer|Edward]] in 1375. Thomas was captured and killed following the attempt to restore [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in the [[Epiphany Rising]].

==Early career==
In 1353 (as an eleven-year-old boy) Henry 'de Exon' became the [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Llandaff]]<ref>"Henry de Exon 1353-?,
By exch. with Geoffrey de Cornasano for a canonry with reservn. of preb. in Lanchester colleg. ch., co. Dur., 12 March 1353 (CPL. 11 482; see above p. 32)."  (from: 'Canons of Llandaff', ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1300-1541: volume 11: The Welsh dioceses (Bangor, Llandaff, St Asaph, St Davids)'' (1965), pp. 32-34, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=32454&amp;strquery=llandaff  On-line version] Date accessed: 13 June 2010.
</ref> and a year later he was secured a canonry of [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. By nineteen he had become the rector of [[Market Bosworth|Bosworth]]<ref name="DNB">''DNB''</ref>
and by February 1361 he was a master at [[Oxford University]], studying civil law.<ref name="DNB" /> He was [[Ordination|ordained]] on December 17, 1362. By April 20, 1364 he was archdeacon of Llandaff. Of his early life [[John Capgrave|Capgrave]] tells us that he spent some time in Italy fighting for [[Pope Urban V]] in his war against [[Milan]] in 1369: 

:'' 'In this same tyme was Ser Herry Spenser a grete werrioure in Ytaile, or the tyme that he was promoted.' ''<ref name="DNB 1900"/><ref>See Capgrave, '' 'The book of illustrious Henries' '', [http://www.archive.org/stream/bookillustrious00capggoog#page/n228/mode/1up On-line version]</ref>

==Bishop of Norwich==
In 1370 Despenser, then the canon of Salisbury, was appointed as [[Bishop of Norwich]] by a [[papal bull]] dated April 3, 1370. He was consecrated at [[Rome]] on April 20 and returned to England. He received the [[spiritualities]] of his see from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] on July 12 and the temporalities from the king August 14.<ref name="DNB 1900"/><ref>''Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae'', p.465</ref>

===Involvement in the suppression of the Peasants' Revolt===
[[Image:The site of the Battle of North Walsham.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|The site of the Battle of North Walsham]]
{{Further|[[Peasants' Revolt]]}}

During the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, rebels from [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] marched to [[London]] and, once admitted to the city, managed to capture the [[Tower of London]]. [[Richard II of England|King Richard]], who had promised to agree to all the demands of the peasants, met the rebels outside the city, where the leader of the peasants [[Wat Tyler]] was killed and the rebellion was ended. The king's promises were retracted. 

The rebellion quickly spread to other parts of England, including the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|diocese of Norwich]], where it lasted for less than a fortnight.<ref name="HAN">''An Historical Atlas of Norfolk''</ref>  
On June 14 a group of rebels reached  [[Thetford]] and from there the insurrection spread over south-western [[Norfolk]] towards the [[Fens]]. At the same time the rebels, led by a local dyer, Geoffrey Litster, moved across the north-eastern part of the county, urging insurrection throughout the local area. Over the next few days, the rebels converged on [[Norwich]], [[King's Lynn|Lynn]] and [[Swaffham]].<ref name="HAN" /> 
Norwich, then one of the largest and most important cities in the realm, was taken and occupied by Litster and his followers, who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of their enemies once they managed to enter the city.<ref name="HAN" /> 
The Norwich rebels then travelled to [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], destroying legal records and landowners' possessions; other insurgents moving across north-east Norfolk destroyed court rolls and taxation documents; there were numerous incidents of pillage and extortion across the whole county.<ref name="HAN" /> 

Despenser first heard news of the rising in his own diocese at a time when he was absent at his manor of [[Burley, Rutland|Burley]] in [[Rutland]], {{convert|100|mi}} west of Norwich. Armed, he hastened back to [[Norfolk]] via [[Peterborough]], [[Cambridge]] and [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]], with a company of only eight lances and a small body of bowmen. His followers increased on the way, and by the time he reached [[North Walsham]], near the Norfolk coast, he had a considerable force under his command. There he found the rebels entrenched and defended by makeshift fortifications. According to [[Thomas Walsingham]],<ref name="DNB 1900"/> 
in the [[Battle of North Walsham]] the bishop himself led the assault and overpowered his enemies in hand-to-hand fighting. Many were slain or captured, including the rebels' leader, who was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] soon afterwards. Despenser personally superintended Litster's execution. In the following months he proceeded to deal with other rebels in his diocese. But the rigour with which he put down the rebellion made him highly unpopular in Norfolk and in the following year a plot was organised to murder him. The scheme was betrayed in time by one of the conspirators, and the plotters were dealt with by the authorities.<ref name="DNB 1900"/><ref>Knighton, ''Chronicle''</ref>

===The Norwich Crusade of 1383===
[[Image:Flanders 1382.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|A map of the 1383 campaign in Flanders, indicating the main towns affected by the crusaders]]

Soon after [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]] had been elected pope in 1378, Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope, taking the name [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] and removing himself to [[Avignon]]. The so-called [[Western Schism]] subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe. It was eventually resolved as a result of the [[Council of Constance]] (1414<U+2013>1418).

In the autumn and winter of 1382, [[Flanders]] had been invaded by [[Charles VI of France]]. [[Philip Van Artevelde]] had fallen at the [[Battle of Roosebeke]] and the country had been compelled to submit to the French king, who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII. In response to events in Flanders, Pope Urban issued [[papal bull|bulls]] for the proclamation of a [[crusade]], choosing Bishop Despenser to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in Flanders. He granted Despenser extraordinary powers for the fulfillment of his mission and [[plenary indulgence]] to those who should take part in or contribute support to it.<ref>Allington-Smith, chapter 4</ref>

Both the commons and [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]] were enthusiastic about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, for political and economic reasons: revenues from the English wool [[Staple port|staple]] (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]]'s unpopular plans for a royal crusade to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]] to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsular]]; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.

On December 6, 1382, Richard ordered the crusade to be published throughout England.<ref name="DNB 1900"/>
Later that month the bishop and his men took the cross at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. In February 1383 Parliament, after hesitating in entrusting a the mission to a churchman, ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying on the war in Flanders.<ref>Walsingham, ''Hist. Angl.'' ii. 84</ref> 
The king's only stipulation was that the crusaders should await the arrival of [[William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny|William Beauchamp]] before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies. 

The bishop issued mandates for the publication of the bulls<ref>Walsingham, ''Hist. Angl.'' ii. 78 et seq.; Knighton, p. 2673 et seq.</ref> 
and the archbishop did the same.<ref>Wilkins, ''Concil Magn<U+00E6> Brit.'' iii. 176-8</ref> 
The enterprise was ardently seconded by the [[friar]]s and contributions of immense value were made from all quarters, but especially, according to [[Henry Knighton]],<ref>Knighton. p. 2671</ref> 
from "the rich ladies of England". 
The English landed at [[Calais]] in May 1383 and proceeded to attack [[Gravelines]], which was in the hands of the French. Gravelines, [[Dunkirk]] and the neighbouring country (including the towns of [[Bourbourg]], [[Bergues]], [[Poperinghe]], and [[Nieuport]]) soon fell. On May 25 the crusaders put to flight a Franco-Flemish army, under the command of the [[Louis II of Flanders|Count of Flanders]], in a pitched battle fought near [[Dunkirk]].<ref>''Westminster Chronicle'' [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/sources/westminster.htm On-line version]</ref><ref>Knighton [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/sources/knighton.htm On-line version]</ref> 
Despenser was then persuaded by his followers to attempt to [[siege|besiege]] [[Ypres]], which was to prove to be the turning point of the crusade. He was unwilling to attack the city but his Gantois allies and some of his officers insisted that Ypres should be taken.<ref>Becke, p.553</ref>

[[Image:The siege of Ypres (1383).pdf|thumb|upright|right|200px|Ypres during the Bishop of Norwich's siege. The illustration, a reproduction of an engraving published in 1610, shows the siege in progress.]]

The inhabitants of Ypres were well prepared for a siege by the time the English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on June 8, 1383. Dwellings in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] and the stone gates of the city. A mission had been dispatched to [[Paris]] to replace artillery powder stocks. The city was well organised under the command of the [[Castellan]] of Ypres, John d'Oultre, and had been divided into different defensive sectors. Although the ramparts were low, they were well protected with a double wet ditch, a high thorny hedge reinforced with stakes and a [[Stockade|wooden stockade]] and fire-step.
<ref>Becke, p.550-1</ref>

The English attacked the Temple Gate on the first day but were beaten off. Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously, without success. Before the end of the first week of the siege, [[reinforcements]] arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil. On the eighth day (June 15) Despenser attacked the defences with [[artillery]], firing on the Messines Gate and damaging it, but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached. Over the following days of the siege, sustained artillery attacks had little overall effect and the assaults of Despenser's troops were all beaten off.<ref>Becke,p.553-4</ref> 
An attempt to drain the ditches seriously threatened the Yprois, but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the [[Duke of Burgundy]] through Louis le M<U+00E2>le, who was able to raise a large French army to come to the aid of the city.<ref>Becke, p.555</ref> 
On August 8, after eight weeks of effort, Despenser abruptly decided to abandon the siege, leaving his allies to continue on their own.

After the d<U+00E9>b<U+00E2>cle at [[Ypres]], the bishop's forces divided, some going back to England, some remaining with the bishop and others under Sir Thomas Trivet and [[Hugh Calveley|Sir Hugh Calveley]] retiring to Bourbourg and Bergues.<ref>Becke, p.562</ref> 
The bishop and Calveley had wished to advance into France, but Sir William Elmham, Trivet and some of the other commanders refused to go.<ref>McKisack p.432</ref> 
The bishop, after entering [[Picardy]] for some distance, was obliged to fall back upon [[Gravelines]]. It turned out that the French had little stomach for a showdown with the English and their allies, preferring instead to negiotiate: part of the French army was unwilling to fight when Despenser and Calveley encountered it when moving towards Picardy. It is possible that had King Richard crossed the Channel with a large English army, the campaign would have ended in a famous victory.<ref name="Allington-Smith p.69-70">Allington-Smith p.69-70</ref> 
However, for the demoralised and disease-ridden English forces, the arrival of the French headed by the boy-king [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] was decisive. Charles had taken the oriflamme on August 2 and his army was mustered in [[Arras]] on August 15.<ref>Saul, p.105</ref> 
They advanced into Flanders, reaching [[Th<U+00E9>rouanne]] by the end of August, [[Drincham]] on September 5, [[Bergues]] on September 7 (forcing Trivet's and Elmham's retreat to Bourbourg and Gravelines) and [[Dunkirk]] on September 9. Bourbourg was besieged on September 12:<ref name="A-146">Aston, p.146</ref>
two days later the [[Duke of Brittany]] persuaded the French to negotiate a surrender and the English garrison was given safe conduct from the town.<ref name="Allington-Smith p.69-70"/> 
The French army then proceeded along the coast and besieged Gravelines. There, without Despenser's authority, the defenders accepted bribes and the bishop's treasurer pocketed 5000 francs. Despenser at first refused the surrender terms,<ref name="A-146" />
but a few days later Gravelines was evacuated and Despenser ordered it to be sacked. By the end of October the remaining crusaders had returned across the English Channel.<ref>Saul p.105</ref>

===Career after 1383===
[[Image:Norwich Cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Norwich Cathedral, one of the great Norman buildings of England. Henry le Despenser is buried in front of the high altar.]]
[[Image:Secretum of Bishop Despenser.png|thumb|upright|right|150px|[[Secretum (book)|Secretum]] of Bishop Despenser]] 
Soon after returning from Flanders, the bishop was [[Impeachment|impeached]] in [[parliament]], on October 26, 1383, in the presence of the king.<ref name="A-128">Aston, p.128</ref> The chancellor [[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Michael de la Pole]] accused him of not mustering his troops at [[Calais]], as had been agreed; not recruiting a high enough number of armed men; refusing to certify properly who his military leaders were; deceiving the king by not allowing a secular lord to command the expedition to Flanders; and disbanding his forces prematurely.<ref name="A-128" /> Despenser denied all the charges, insisting that enough men had assembled at Ypres, that he had chosen his commanders well and that he had not refused to obey the king's orders. After de la Pole declared the bishop's replies to be insufficient, Despenser requested another hearing to defend himself still further, which was granted. In this hearing Despencer proceeded to blame his own commanders for forcing him to retreat from Ypres and then evacuate the garrisons. All his arguments were refuted and he was blamed for the failure of the expedition. His [[temporalities]] were confiscated and he was ordered to repay any costs taken from money gained from the French.<ref>Aston, p.131''</ref><ref>Allington-Smith, p.73-78</ref>

Despenser's fall from grace did not last long. Following Scottish incursions into England, it was decided that the 18 year old Richard should lead an army into [[Scotland]], marking the start of his military career.<ref>Oxford DNB'' 'Richard II' ''</ref>  In 1385 every magnate of consequence, including Despenser, joined the immense host that advanced north with the king,<ref name="McKisack, p.439-40">McKisack, p.439-40</ref> 
<blockquote>
''"finding a country totally waste, where there was nothing to plunder, and little that could even be destroyed, excepting here and there a tower, whose massive walls defied all means of destruction then known, or a cluster of miserable huts.... "''' (Sir Walter Scott, ''Scotland, vol. 1'').<ref>Scott, p.224, [http://www.archive.org/stream/scotland01scotuoft#page/224/mode/2up Web version]</ref>
</blockquote>  
The English army reached [[Edinburgh]], which was sacked, but then retreated back to England, despite [[John of Gaunt]]'s wish to go on to [[Fife]].<ref name="McKisack, p.439-40"/> The Scottish campaign was one of the last times that Despenser marched with an army.

[[Image:North Elmham chapel ruins.jpg|thumb|upright|right|250px|The ruins of Despenser's manor house at North Elmham, built over the site of the ancient Saxon cathedral and a Norman chapel.]]
Henry le Despenser continued to be controversial after his fighting career was over, mainly because of the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges.

For over a decade Despenser was involved in disputes with the chapter of Norwich Cathedral and with other religious communities in his diocese, mainly concerning the bishop's right to intervene in their internal affairs. In 1384 the monks appealed successfully to pope [[Boniface IX]] against Despenser, but in 1385 matters were still not resolved, for that year the pope ordered [[William Courtenay]] the Archbishop of Canterbury to assist in mediating between the parties. On Richard II's instruction, the bishop and the convent instead appeared before Archbishop Courtenay and a royal council, but Courtenay's death in July 1386 prevented a resolution of the dispute from being finalised until 1398, when a royal commission decided in favour of Despenser. Pope Boniface annulled the decisions of the commission in 1401, after the convent appealed to him, but the papal sentences were ignored by Despenser.  Eventually the monks came to terms with the bishop and accepted a loss of their autonomy.<ref>''Norwich Cathedral'' p.297</ref>

====Fighting Lollardy====
[[Image:William Sautrey.gif|thumb|upright|right|125px|The execution of William Sawtrey.]]
{{Further|[[Lollardy]]}}
Since 1381, there had been a growing fear of [[Lollardy]] among the English political elite. The Lollards had first appeared in the 1370s and had briefly found favour with the upper classes, but in 1382 power was given for the authorities to detain [[Heresy|heretics]] and examine them in a Church court. During the second half of his reign Richard II became steadily more determined to maintain religious [[orthodoxy]] and acted increasingly harshly to suppress the Lollards.<ref>Saul, ch.13</ref>  His successor [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] went even further, introducing [[De heretico comburendo|the death penalty for heresy and for possession of a bible]]. 

Despenser took active steps to maintain orthodoxy in his own diocese. The chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] praised Henry's actions against the Lollards and contrasted him with his fellow bishops:
<blockquote>
"He swore, moreover, and did not repent of what he said, that if anyone belonging to that perverse sect should presume to preach in his diocese, they should be taken to the fire or beheaded. Consequently, having understood this, no one belonging to that tendency had any desire to embrace martyrdom, with the result that, up to now, the faith and true religion have remained unaffected within the bounds of his episcopal authority." (Walsingham, ''Historia Anglicana'').<ref>Allington-Smith, p. 107</ref>
</blockquote> 
Henry however appears not to have dealt too savagely in dealing with heretics. On May 1, 1399, [[William Sawtrey]], a Norfolk [[curate]] and a Lollard, was examined before him. Sawtrey [[Recantation|recanted]] his heresies in public and apparently received no serious punishment, but after moving to London, Sawtrey's heretical preaching attracted the attention of Archbishop [[Thomas Arundel]] and he was summoned to appear before a convocation at St. Paul's. Despenser did not attend but sent a written memorandum on February 23. Following his trial Sawtrey was condemned as a relapsed heretic and was [[Death by burning|burned]] in chains at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] in 1401.<ref name="DNB"/>

====Final years====
Upon the death of [[John of Gaunt]] on February 3, 1399, his son [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] became the Duke of Lancaster, but Richard II moved quickly to strip him of his patrimony. Bolingbroke resolved to return to England from [[Paris]]<ref>''History of England'' p.7</ref> to claim the restoration of his family estates and in July 1399 he disembarked at [[Ravenspur]].<ref name="A-S-123">Allington-Smith, p.123</ref> Henry le Despenser reacted to these events by standing loyally by Richard. On July 2 he commissioned three [[Vicar general|vicars-general]] to deputise for him whilst he was absent from the diocese and by July 10 he had reached [[St. Albans]] with reinforcements for the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Duke of York's]] army.<ref name="A-S-123" />
There he joined up with York and they travelled to join the king as he returned from [[Ireland]], whilst Bolingbroke moved south towards [[Bristol]] to intercept Richard's supporters.<ref name="A-S-123" />  Despenser was with York at [[Berkeley Castle]] when he came to terms with Bolingbroke at the end of July, but the bishop refused to submit and was arrested and briefly imprisoned.<ref>''Chronique de la trahison et mort de Richart II, p.292</ref> On September 30 Bolingbroke was proclaimed king in [[London]], an event that Despenser may have witnessed.<ref name="A-S-124">Allington-Smith, p.124</ref> He attended the first parliament of the new reign, on October 6, 1399 in which it was agreed that Richard should be imprisoned.<ref name="A-S-124" /> After this time Dispenser's influence in his diocese seems to have shifted to [[Thomas Erpingham|Sir Thomas Erpingham]].<ref>Allington-Smith, p.99</ref><ref>''DNB'' (1900)</ref>

He was implicated in the abortive <U+2018>[[Epiphany Rising]]' of January 1400, during which his nephew [[Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Thomas, Earl of Gloucester]] played a key part and was subsequently executed. Thomas had been created Earl of Gloucester by Richard II, but in 1399 was accused of being involved in the death of the son of the [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] and as a result lost his earldom.  He joined in the conspiracy of the earls of [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Rutland]], [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|Kent]] and [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter|Huntingdon]] and was with their army at [[Cirencester]], when they were attacked by the townsmen, who burnt Thomas le Despenser's lodgings. Thomas fled, boarding a ship, but the captain forced him to [[Bristol]], where on 13 January <ref>Chronicles of the revolution, 1397-1400: the reign of Richard II By Chris Given-Wilsonp.xv</ref> he was released to the mob and beheaded at the high cross.<ref>DNB 1900</ref>

In the aftermath of the rebellion Henry le Despenser appointed John Derlington, the [[archdeacon]] of Norwich, as his vicar-general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of [[Thomas Arundel|Archbishop Arundel]] who accompanied him to Parliament on January 20, 1401.<ref>DNB</ref> There his enemy [[Thomas Erpingham|Sir Thomas Erpingham]] falsely accused him of being involved in the plot. He was finally reconciled to Henry IV when the king granted him a [[pardon]] in 1401.<ref>Stubbs, <U+00A7> 306 p.26-7, p.32.</ref>

Despenser died on August 23, 1406 <ref>Le Neve p.465</ref> and was buried in [[Norwich Cathedral]] before the high altar. A brass inscription dedicated to him was placed there, but has since been destroyed.<ref>Blomefield, vol.3 ([http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=78008 Web version])</ref>
