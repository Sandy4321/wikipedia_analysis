'''Producci<U+00F3>n y Distribuci<U+00F3>n Venezolana de Alimentos''' ('''PDVAL'''), is a nationwide food supply network created by Venezuelan president [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] and [[PDVSA|Petr<U+00F3>leos de Venezuela (PDVSA)]] in response to the high food demand and presumed stockpiling by private food sectors, creating food shortage.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2008/738/38209 Venezuela: Combatting food shortages]</ref> Along with the related [[Mission Mercal]], it was started following the [[Venezuelan general strike of 2002<U+2013>2003]], which saw concerns about corporate control of food distribution.

PDVAL's goal is to distribute basic goods such as meat, milk, chicken and other goods which prices are regulated by the government.
