Bulgaria borders five other countries: [[Romania]] to the north (mostly along the [[Danube]]), [[Serbia]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the west, and [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south. The [[Black Sea]] defines the extent of the country to the east.

With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2|sp=us}}, Bulgaria ranks as the [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]] in Europe. Several mountainous areas define the landscape, most notably the [[Stara Planina]] (''Balkan'') and [[Rhodope Mountains|Rodopi]] mountain ranges, as well as the [[Rila]] range, which includes the highest peak in the Balkan region, [[Musala]]. In contrast, the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian plain]] in the north and the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] in the south represent Bulgaria's lowest and most fertile regions. The {{convert|378|km|adj=on|sp=us}} Black Sea coastline covers the entire eastern bound of the country.

The emergence of a unified Bulgarian national identity and state dates back to the 7th century AD. All Bulgarian political entities that subsequently emerged preserved the traditions (in ethnic name, language and alphabet) of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] (681<U+2013>1018), which at times covered most of the [[Balkans]] and eventually became a cultural hub for the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>

With the decline of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] (1185<U+2013>1396/1422), Bulgarian territories came under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877<U+2013>1878 led to the establishment of a [[History of Bulgaria (1878-1946)|Third Bulgarian state]] as a [[constitutional monarchy|principality]] in 1878, which gained its full sovereignty in 1908.<ref>Crampton, R.J., ''Bulgaria'', 2007, pp.174, Oxford University Press</ref> In 1945, after World War II, it became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist state]] and was a part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] until the [[Revolutions of 1989|political changes in Eastern Europe]] in 1989/1990, when the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] allowed multi-party elections and Bulgaria undertook a transition to [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[free-market]] [[capitalism]] with mixed results.

Bulgaria functions as a [[parliament]]ary [[democracy]] within a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[constitutional republic]]. A member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]], it has a high [[Human Development Index]] of 0.840, ranking 61st in the world in 2009.<ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bulgaria}}

===Prehistory and antiquity===
{{See|Neolithic Europe|Bronze Age Europe|Thrace|Odrysian kingdom|Slavs}}

Prehistoric cultures in the Bulgarian lands include the [[Neolithic]] [[Hamangia culture]] and [[Vin<U+010D>a culture]] (6th to 3rd millennia BC), the [[eneolithic]] [[Varna culture]] (5th millennium BC; see also [[Varna Necropolis]]), and the [[Bronze Age]] [[Ezero culture]]. The [[Karanovo chronology]] serves as a gauge for the prehistory of the wider Balkans region.

[[File:Panagyurishte gold.jpg|250|thumb|left|A golden [[rhyton]], one of the items in the [[Thracian]] [[Panagyurishte treasure]], dating from the 4th to 3rd centuries BC]]

The [[Thracians]], one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians, lived separated in various tribes until King [[Teres I|Teres]] united most of them around 500 BC in the [[Odrysian kingdom]]. They were eventually subjugated by [[Alexander the Great]] and consecutively by the Roman Empire. After migrating from their original homeland, the easternmost South Slavs settled on the territory of modern Bulgaria during the 6th century and assimilated the Hellenized or Romanized Thracians. Eventually the Bulgar <U+00E9>lite incorporated all of them into the First Bulgarian Empire.<ref name=EB1911>[[s:1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica/Bulgaria/History]]</ref> By the 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs were mutually assimilated.<ref name="Bulgaria">"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84090/Bulgaria Bulgaria]". Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.</ref>

=== First Bulgarian Empire ===
{{Main|First Bulgarian Empire}}

[[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], heir of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]'s khan [[Kubrat]], migrated with several Bulgar tribes to the lower courses of the rivers [[Danube]], [[Dniester]] and [[Dniepr]] (known as ''Ongal'') after his father's state was subjugated by the [[Khazars]]. He conquered [[Moesia]] and [[Scythia Minor]] ([[Dobrudzha]]) from the [[Byzantine Empire]], expanding his new kingdom further into the Balkan Peninsula.<ref>Runciman, p. 26</ref> A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 and the establishment of the Bulgarian capital of [[Pliska]] south of the Danube mark the beginning of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].

Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state <U+2013> [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] (700/701<U+2013>718/721), stabilized the borders and established Bulgaria as a major military power by defeating a 22,000-strong [[Arab]] army in 717, thereby eliminating the threat of a full-scale Arab invasion of Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>C. de Boor (ed), ''Theophanis chronographia'', vol. 1.

as well as one of his most decisive victories. His reign also saw Bulgaria develop a rich, unique Christian Slavonic culture, which became an example for other Slavonic peoples in Eastern Europe and also fostered the continued existence of the Bulgarian nation despite forces that threatened to tear it apart.

=== Byzantine rule and Second Bulgarian Empire ===
{{Main|Uprising of Asen and Peter|Second Bulgarian Empire}}

[[Basil II]] managed to prevent rebellions by retaining the local rule of the Bulgarian nobility, who were incorporated into [[Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy|Byzantine aristocracy]] as [[archon]]s or [[strategos|strategoi]],<ref name="Zlatarski">

However, it was not until 1185 when [[Asen dynasty]] nobles [[Ivan Asen I]] and [[Peter IV of Bulgaria|Peter IV]] organized a major uprising and succeeded in reestablishing the Bulgarian state, marking the beginning of the Second Bulgarian Empire.

The Asen dynasty set up its capital in [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. [[Kaloyan]], the third of the Asen monarchs, extended his dominions to Belgrade, [[Nish]] and [[Skopie]]; he acknowledged the spiritual supremacy of [[the Pope]], and received a royal crown from a [[papal legate]].<ref name=EB1911 /> Cultural and economic growth persisted under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218<U+2013>1241), who extended Bulgaria's control over [[Albania]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], Macedonia and Thrace.<ref>Jiri<U+010D>ek, p.295</ref> The achievements of the [[Tarnovo artistic school]] as well as the first coins to be minted by a Bulgarian ruler were only a few signs of the empire's welfare at that time.<ref name=EB1911 />

[[File:Ivan shishman preobravenski manastir.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]], the last ruler of the Tarnovo Tsardom (1371<U+2013>1395)]]

The Asen dynasty ended in 1257, and due to [[Tatar invasions]] (beginning in the later 13th century), internal conflicts, and constant attacks from the Byzantines and the Hungarians, the country's military and economic might declined. By the end of the 14th century, factional divisions between Bulgarian feudal landlords (''[[boyars|bolyari]]'') and the spread of [[Bogomilism]] had caused the Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three small tsardoms (At Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna) and several semi-independent principalities that fought among themselves, and also with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] and [[Genoese Republic|Genoese]]. In the period 1365<U+2013>1370, the Ottoman Turks, who had already started their invasion of the Balkans, conquered most Bulgarian towns and fortresses south of the Balkan Mountains and began their northwards conquest.<ref>Jiri<U+010D>ek, p. 382</ref>

In 1393, the Ottomans captured Tarnovo, the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, after a three-month siege. In 1396, the Vidin Tsardom fell after the defeat of a Christian [[crusade]] at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. With this, the Ottomans finally subjugated and occupied Bulgaria.<ref>

Throughout the nearly five centuries of Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian people responded to the oppression by strengthening the ''[[haydut]]'' ("outlaw") tradition,<ref name="Bulgaria"/> and attempted to reestablish their state by organizing several revolts, most notably the [[First Tarnovo Uprising|First]] and [[Second Tarnovo Uprising]]s (1598 / 1686) and [[Karposh's Rebellion]] (1689). The [[National awakening of Bulgaria]] became one of the key factors in the struggle for [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberation]], resulting in the 1876 [[April uprising]] <U+2014>the largest and best-organized Bulgarian rebellion. Though crushed by the Ottoman authorities <U+2013> in reprisal, the Turks massacred some 15,000 Bulgarians<ref name="Bulgaria"/> <U+2013> the uprising prompted the [[Great Powers]] to take action. They convened the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876, but their decisions were rejected by the Ottoman authorities, which allowed the [[Russian Empire]] to seek a solution by force without risking military confrontation with other Great Powers (as had happened in the [[Crimean War]] of 1854 to 1856).

The [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877<U+2013>78, resulted in the defeat of Ottoman forces by the Russian army (supported by Bulgarian and Romanian volunteer forces) and the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] (3 March 1878), which set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality. The Western [[great power|Great Powers]] immediately rejected the treaty, fearing that a large Slavic country in the Balkans might serve Russian interests.

In 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria became involved in the [[Balkan Wars]], first entering into conflict alongside Greece, Serbia and Montenegro against the Ottoman Empire. The [[First Balkan War]] (1912<U+2013>1913) proved a success for the Bulgarian army, but a conflict over the division of Macedonia arose between the victorious allies. The [[Second Balkan War]] (1913) was a disastrous defeat for Bulgaria, which was attacked almost simultaneously by its neighbors. In World War I, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the [[Central Powers]]. Despite achieving several decisive victories (at [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|Doiran]], [[Battle of Monastir (1917)|Monastir]] and again at [[Battle of Doiran|Doiran in 1918]]), Bulgaria lost the war and suffered significant territorial losses.<ref name="Bulgaria"/> The total amount of casualties from these three wars was 412,000<U+2013>152,000 military deaths and 260,000 wounded.

Following these losses, in the 1920s and 1930s the country suffered political unrest, which led to the establishment of a royal [[authoritarianism|authoritarian dictatorship]] by Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] (reigned 1918<U+2013>1943). After regaining control of Southern Dobrudzha in 1940, Bulgaria entered World War II in 1941 as a member of [[Axis Powers|the Axis]]. However, it declined to participate in [[Operation Barbarossa]] and never declared war on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and saved its Jewish population from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] by repeatedly postponing compliance with German demands, offering various rationales.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0052) Bulgaria in World War II : The Passive Alliance], Library of Congress</ref> In the summer of 1943 Boris III died suddenly, an event which pushed the country into political turmoil as the war turned against Nazi Germany and the Communist guerilla movement gained more power.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0053) Bulgaria: Wartime Crisis], Library of Congress</ref>

In September 1944 the Communist-dominated [[Fatherland Front]] took power, ending the alliance with Nazi Germany and joining the Allied side until the end of the war in 1945. The [[Bulgarian coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1944|Communist uprising]] of 9 September 1944 led to the abolishment of monarchic rule, but it was not until 1946 that a [[people's republic]] was established.

Geographically and in terms of climate, Bulgaria features notable diversity, with the landscape ranging from the [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] snow-capped peaks in [[Rila]], [[Pirin]] and the [[Balkan Mountains]] to the mild and sunny Black Sea coast; from the typically [[continental climate|continental]] [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] (ancient [[Moesia]]) in the north to the strong [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climatic influence]] in the valleys of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and in the lowlands in the southernmost parts of [[Thrace]].

=== Relief and natural resources ===

Bulgaria comprises portions of the separate regions known in [[Ancient Rome|classical times]] as [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]], and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. About 30% of the land is made up of plains, while plateaus and hills account for 41%.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0072) Topography], Library of Congress.</ref> The mountainous southwest of the country has two alpine ranges&nbsp;<U+2014> [[Rila]] and [[Pirin]]&nbsp;<U+2014> and further east stand the lower but more extensive [[Rhodope Mountains]]. The [[Rila]] range includes the highest peak of the Balkan Peninsula, [[Musala]], at {{convert|2925|m|ft|0|sp=us}};<ref>{{cite book |title=<U+0411><U+044A><U+043B><U+0433><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430> <U+0435><U+043D><U+0446><U+0438><U+043A><U+043B><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0434><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0410>-<U+042F> |publisher=<U+0411><U+0410><U+041D>, <U+0422><U+0440><U+0443><U+0434>, <U+0421><U+0438><U+0440><U+043C><U+0430> |language=Bulgarian |year=2002 |chapter=<U+041C><U+0443><U+0441><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430> |isbn=9548104083 |oclc=163361648 }}</ref> the [[Balkan mountains|Balkan mountain chain]] runs west-east through the middle of the country, north of the [[Rose Valley, Bulgaria|Rose Valley]]. Hilly countryside and plains lie to the southeast, along the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea]] coast, and along Bulgaria's main river, the [[Danube]], to the north. [[Strandja|Strandzha]] forms the tallest mountain in the southeast. Few mountains and hills exist in the northeast region of [[Dobrudja|Dobrudzha]].

[[File:Sozopolivanpetarkirik.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Black Sea]] as seen from Bakurluka peak near [[Sozopol]]. ]]

Bulgaria has large deposits of [[bauxite]], [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[bismuth]] and [[manganese]]. Smaller deposits exist of [[iron]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], [[chromite]], [[nickel]], and others. Bulgaria has abundant non-metalliferous minerals such as [[rock-salt]], [[gypsum]], [[kaolin]] and [[marble]].

=== Hydrography and climate ===

The country has a dense network of about 540 rivers, most of them<U+2014>with the notable exception of the [[Danube]]<U+2014>short and with low water-levels.<ref>

</ref>
Most rivers flow through mountainous areas. The longest river located solely in Bulgarian territory, the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], has a length of {{convert|368|km|0|sp=us}}. Other major rivers include the [[Struma River|Struma]] and the [[Maritsa|Maritsa River]] in the south.

Bulgaria overall has a [[temperate climate]], with cold winters and hot summers. The barrier effect of the [[Balkan Mountains]] has some influence on climate throughout the country<U+2013>northern Bulgaria experiences lower temperatures and receives more rain than the southern lowlands.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Bulgaria averages about {{convert|630|mm|in|1|sp=us}} per year.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0074) Climate], Library of Congress.</ref> In the lowlands rainfall varies between {{convert|500|and|800|mm|1|sp=us}}, and in the mountain areas between {{convert|1000|and|2500|mm|1|sp=us}} of rain falls per year. Drier areas include [[Dobrudja]] and the northern coastal strip, while the higher parts of the [[Rila]], [[Pirin]], [[Rhodope Mountains]], [[Stara Planina]], [[Osogovska]] Mountain and [[Vitosha]] receive the highest levels of precipitation.

[...] The European Union imposed a special corruption monitoring scheme on Bulgaria and neighboring Romania when they joined the EU in January 2007, because it was felt they were not yet up to EU levels. 

If Bulgaria does not meet specified benchmarks, the EU can impose what it calls safeguard clauses.

[[Association football|Football]] has become by far the most popular sport in the country. [[Dimitar Berbatov]] (Manchester United) is one of the most famous Bulgarian football players of the 21st century, while [[Hristo Stoichkov]], twice winner of the [[European Golden Shoe]], is the most successful Bulgarian player of all time.<ref>[http://www.epfl-europeanleagues.com/fao/hristo_stoichkov.htm Hristo Stoichkov <U+2013> Bulgarian League Ambassador], Professional Football Against Hunger</ref><ref>[http://bulgarian.ibox.bg/news/id_452784631 Hristo Stoichkov: For sure Barcelona will win tonight], news.bg, 27.05.2009</ref> Prominent domestic football clubs include [[PFC CSKA Sofia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bgclubs.eu/ranking/points |title=Rankings of A Group |publisher=Bgclubs.eu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ingo Faulhaber |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?a413f0e03790c443e0f40390b41be8b01905fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeedb883ccb05ff1d |title=Best club of 20th century ranking at the official site of the International Federation of Football History and Statistics |publisher=Iffhs.de |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>

Bulgaria participates both in the Summer and Winter Olympics, and its first Olympic appearance dates back to the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first modern Olympic games]] in 1896, represented by Swiss gymnast [[Charles Champaud]]. Since then the country has appeared in most Summer Olympiads, and by 2010 had won a total of 218 medals: 52 gold, 86 silver, and 80 bronze, which puts it at 24th place in the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|all-time ranking]].
