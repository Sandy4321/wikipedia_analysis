Jackson's version of "A Place with No Name" is not the first song by a member of the musical [[Jackson family]] to sample the work of America. [[Janet Jackson]]'s hit "[[Someone to Call My Lover]]"<U+2014>from the 2001&nbsp;album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''<U+2014>samples "[[Ventura Highway]]", a song from America's 1972 ''[[Homecoming (America album)|Homecoming]]'' album.<ref name="America Respond To Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name'" />

==Response from America==
Dewey Bunnell and [[Gerry Beckley]]<U+2014>two members of the three part band<U+2014>conveyed their gratitude toward Jackson for choosing their song as a musical template for "A Place with No Name". In their statement to MTV, the musicians also expressed regret that the pop singer's fans did not get to hear the finished version of the track while Jackson was still alive:<ref name="America 'Honored' By Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name' Sample" /><ref name="America Respond To Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name'" />

<blockquote>
We're honored that Michael Jackson chose to record it and we're impressed with the quality of the track. We're also hoping it will be released soon so that music listeners around the world can hear the whole song and once again experience the incomparable brilliance of Michael Jackson [...] Michael Jackson really did it justice and we truly hope his fans<U+2014>and our fans<U+2014>get to hear it in its entirety. It<U+2019>s really poignant.<ref name="America 'Honored' By Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name' Sample" /><ref name="America Respond To Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name'" />
</blockquote>

Bunnell further commented that he was "very proud of the fact that [Jackson] recorded it. It's a good version and an interesting derivative of the original that I wrote." The songwriter stated that he and Beckley were "definitely in the dark" regarding the future of Jackson's unreleased material.<ref name="America rides in on 'horse with no name'">{{cite web|url=http://www.starbulletin.com/features/20090807_america_rides_in_on_horse_with_no_name.html|title=America rides in on 'horse with no name'|last=Berger|first=John|date=August 7, 2009|publisher=''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]''|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>

==Possibility of release==
In late August 2009, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that no plans had been made for the release of a full or official version of "A Place with No Name"; currently, only the 24-second snippet is known to exist. In addition to the leaked Jackson song, there is rumored to be a "vast vault" of the singer's other unreleased material, which may be released in the future.<ref name="America Respond To Michael Jackson's 'A Place With No Name'" />

At the time of "A Place with No Name" being leaked, the curator of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jim Henke, noted that any future Jackson releases would garner significant attention. "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. I think we are going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on."<ref name="Michael Jackson's Unreleased Songs, Continuing the Music Legacy">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/MichaelJackson/Story?id=8107736&page=1|title=Michael Jackson's Unreleased Songs, Continuing the Music Legacy|last=Netter|first=Sarah|date=July 17, 2009|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>

Dr. Freeze has claimed in a January 30, 2011 interview with MJFrance that "A Place with No Name" and "Blue Gangsta" were both slated to appear on Michael's next album of unreleased music, but didn't hint at a release date <ref name="INTERVIEW EXCLUSIVE: DR.
