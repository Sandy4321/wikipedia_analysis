{{nihongo|'''''Shigure'''''|<U+6642><U+96E8>|<U+201D>Late Rains<U+201D>}} <ref>Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. Page 481</ref> was the second of ten {{sclass|Shiratsuyu|destroyer}}s, and the first to be built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] under the [[1st Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1931)|Circle One Program]] (''Maru Ichi Keikaku'').<ref>Lengerer, pp. 92-3</ref>  Along with the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yukikaze||2}}, she developed a reputation within the Imperial Japanese Navy for being "lucky" or "unsinkable",  emerging as the sole surviving Japanese warship from numerous battles.  ''Shigure'' was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by {{USS|Blackfin|SS-322}} in the [[Gulf of Siam]] on 25 January 1945.

==History==
The ''Shiratsuyu'' class destroyers were modified versions of the {{sclass|Hatsuharu|destroyer|0}}, and were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night [[torpedo]] attacks against the [[United States Navy]] as it advanced across the [[Pacific Ocean]], according to Japanese naval strategic projections.<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun'' .</ref> Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers</ref>

''Shigure'', built at the [[Uraga Dock Company]] was laid down on 9 December 1933, launched on 18 May 1935 and commissioned on 7 September 1936.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0426.htm| title= Shiratsuyu class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}</ref>

==Operational history==
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Shigure'' was assigned to Destroyer Division 27 of Destroyer Squadron 1 of the [[IJN 1st Fleet]] on anti-submarine warfare patrols in Japanese home waters and to assist in guarding Japan<U+2019>s main battle fleet.  In early 1942, ''Shigure'' was assigned to [[convoy]] escort duties, escorting {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih<U+014D>||2}} to [[Davao]], and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh<U+014D>kaku||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}} to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. At the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] on 7 May, ''Shigure'' was part of the escort for Admiral [[Takeo Takagi]]<U+2019>s Strike Force and at the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4<U+2013>6 June, she was part of the Aleutians Guard Force under Admiral [[Shir<U+014D> Takasu]].  ''Shigure'' was reassigned to the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]] on 14 July after the Midway Operation was cancelled.  In mid-August, ''Shigure'' escorted the fleet to Truk, and was then assigned to cover a troop transport run to reoccupy [[Makin Atoll]] after the [[Makin Raid]]. Based out of [[Jaluit]] in September, ''Shigure'' helped secure [[Abemama]] in the [[Gilbert Islands]] and [[Nendo Island|Ndeni]] in the [[Santa Cruz Islands]], before escorting a troop convoy from [[Palau]] to [[Rabaul]] on 24 September. In October and November, she made eight "[[Tokyo Express]]" troop transport runs to [[Guadalcanal]]. In the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal#First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, November 13|First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on the night of 12<U+2013>13 November 1942 she was part of the distant screening force and saw no combat, but later rescued survivors of the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}. At the end of the year, she escorted {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ch<U+016B>y<U+014D>||2}} from Truk to Yokosuka and  back to Truk.

In mid-January 1943, ''Shigure'' escorted a troop convoy from Truk to [[Shortland Island|Shortlands]], and was later assigned to "[[Operation KE]]", to cover troop evacuations from Guadalcanal. She returned to Sasebo in mid-February for repairs. ''Shigure''returned to Truk in mid-March, escorting ''Ch<U+016B>y<U+014D>'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taiy<U+014D>||2}} from Truk to Yokosuka in mid-April and returning with ''Ch<U+016B>y<U+014D>'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Uny<U+014D>||2}} at the end of the month. In mid-May, she escorted {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} from Truk to Yokosuka, returning to Truk by 21 June. In July, she was assigned to accompany the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Nagara||2}} on various assignments around the Solomon Islands, and was reassigned to the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]] on 20 July. She made a "Tokyo Express" troop transport run to [[Rekata Bay]] on 27 July, and to [[Kolombangara]] on 1 August.

During the [[Battle of Vella Gulf]] of 6<U+2013>7 August, ''Shigure'' was the only of four Japanese destroyers to escape.<ref>{{cite book | last = D'Albas | first = Andrieu| year = 1965 | title = Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II  | publisher = Devin-Adair Pub| isbn = 0-8159-5302-X}}</ref> During the [[Battle off Horaniu]] on 17<U+2013>18 August, she again engaged United States Navy destroyers without damage while covering a troop transport mission to [[Vella Lavella]]. At the end of August, she made two troop evacuation runs to Rekata Bay, one of which was aborted, and one mission to [[Tuluvu]] and to [[Buka, Papua New Guinea]] in September. She further covered two troop evacuation missions to Kolombangara at the end of September and early October.She was covering troop evacuations at Vella Lavella during the 6<U+2013>7 October [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|Battle of Vella Lavella]], and contributed to massive damage to {{USS|Selfridge|DD-357}}. For the remainder of October, she participated in four more transport runs to points in [[New Guinea]]. At the [[Battle of Empress Augusta Bay]] on 2 November, she engaged an American cruiser-destroyer formation, but without damage. After making a final troop transport mission to Buka on 6 November, she escorted a convoy from Rabaul to Truk, rescuing 70 survivors of the transport ''Tokyo Maru'' en route on 10 November. She returned to Sasebo in mid-November for repairs. Departing Sasebo on 24 December, she collided with a fishing boat in [[Bungo Strait]], and was forced to return again to Sasebo for further repairs.

In January 1944, ''Shigure'' escorted {{ship|Japanese food ship|Irako}} from Yokosuka to Truk, and in early February escorted tanker convoys from Truk to [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] and [[Balikpapan]]. She suffered heavy damage in an air raid on Truk by United States Navy aircraft, taking a direct bomb hit to her No.2 [[gun turret]], killing 21 crewmen and wounding 45 others. She was withdrawn to Palau for emergency repairs, and returned to Sasebo on 22 March, where her damaged turret was removed and replaced by two triple [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96 anti-aircraft gun]] mounts. Repairs completed by 11 May, she escorted {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi}} and aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chitose}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Chiyoda}}, {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuih<U+014D>}} to [[Tawitawi]], and from there to [[Davao]]. In June she was assigned to <U+201C>Operation KON<U+201D>, (the reinforcement of [[Biak]]), in response to American landings. She rescued 110 survivors from {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Harusame}} on 8 June, and then engaged in combat against a group of Allied cruisers and destroyers, taking two shell hits, which killed seven crewmen and wounded 15 others.  From 19<U+2013>20 June, ''Shigure'' was at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] as part of Admiral [[Takatsugu J<U+014D>jima]]<U+2019>s <U+201C>Force B<U+201D>, and assisted in the rescue of survivors from the aircraft carrier {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiy<U+014D>}}. In July, she was assigned to escort a troop convoy from [[Kure Naval District|Kure]] to [[Okinawa]], and in August accompanied {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Kinu}} on a transport mission from [[Singapore]] to [[Brunei]], [[Manila]] and Palau, returning via [[Cebu (island)|Cebu]].  In October, ''Shigure'' sortied from Lingga and Brunei and was at the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] on 22<U+2013>25 October. She took minor damage from a direct bomb hit to her forward gun turret on 24 October, killing five crewmen and wounding six. She took further damage in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] in which a direct shell hit and several near misses took out her radio, compass, and steering, but she was the only ship of the <U+201C>Southern Force<U+201D> to survive the battle, and limped back to Brunei on 27 October.  ''Shigure'' returned to Sasebo for repairs in November, possibly sinking {{USS|Growler|SS-215}} off [[Mindoro]] on 8 November en route. She was reassigned to the [[IJN 5th Fleet]] on 15 November and the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]] on 20 November, departing Kure on 17 December with {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Unry<U+016B>}} for Manila. After ''Unry<U+016B>'' was sunk by {{USS|Redfish|SS-395}}, ''Shigure'' and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Momi}} rescued the 146 survivors.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brown | first = David| year = 1990 | title = Warship Losses of World War Two | publisher = Naval Institute Press| isbn = 1-55750-914-X}}</ref>

On 25 January 1945, while escorting a convoy from [[Hong Kong]] to [[Singapore]], ''Shigure'' was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by {{USS|Blackfin|SS-322}} in the [[Gulf of Siam]], approximately {{convert|160|mi|km}} east of [[Kota Bharu]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]] at position ({{coord|06|00|N|103|48|E}}). She sank slowly, allowing for 270 survivors to escape, with 37 crewmen lost. The survivors were rescued by {{ship|Japanese escort|Kanju||2}} and {{ship|Japanese escort|Miyake||2}}. ''Shigure'' was removed from the [[navy list]] on 10 March 1945.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/shigur_t.htm CombinedFleet.com | title=  IJN ''Shigure'': Tabular Record of Movement | last= Nevitt | first=  Allyn D.   | year= 1997 |month= | work= Long Lancers | publisher= Combinedfleet.com}}</ref>
