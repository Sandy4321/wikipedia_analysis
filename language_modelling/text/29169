She is best known for her long-running role as [[Sophia Petrillo]] on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' from [[1985]] to [[1992]], on ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' from 1992 to [[1993]] and on ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'' from 1993 to [[1995]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Getty was born '''Estelle Scher''' in [[New York City]], the daughter of Sarah and Charles Scher, [[Jew]]ish immigrants from [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]] who worked in the glass business.<ref name=filmr>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Estelle-Getty.html Estelle Getty Biography (1923<U+2013>)]</ref> Getty got her start in the [[Yiddish theater]] and also as a comedienne in the [[Catskills]] [[borscht belt]] resorts, and among her most notable stage roles was as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s mother in ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]'' during its original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run. She is best known for her role as [[Sophia Petrillo]] on the popular 1980s [[sitcom]] ''[[The Golden Girls]]''. Her character was the wise-cracking [[Sicily|Sicilian]] mother of [[Dorothy Zbornak]], played by [[Beatrice Arthur]] (the other main characters being played by [[Betty White]] and [[Rue McClanahan]]); in real life, Getty was in fact one year ''younger'' than Arthur.

Toward the end of her career, she wrote an autobiography, with Steve Delsohn, titled ''If I Knew Then, What I Know Now... So What?'' (Contemporary Books, 1988).<ref name=filmr/>

===Personal life===
Getty was married to Arthur Gettleman (from whose name she adapted into her stage name) from 1947 until his death in 2004. Getty had two sons: Carl Gettleman, who lives in [[California]], and Barry Gettleman, who lives in [[Florida]].<ref name="getty-faq">[http://www.estellegetty.com/faq.html www.estellegetty.com]</ref>

In 1991, as later reported in [[Star (magazine)|''Star'' magazine]], Getty helped to nurse her 29-year-old nephew Steven Scher, who was near death and suffering from the final stages of [[AIDS]].{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Because Scher's parents lived in England and his friends were no longer able to care for him in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], Getty had him flown to California and admitted to hospice care. He died in January 1992.

In 2000, Getty stopped making public appearances after revealing she had [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. In 2002, media reports claimed she was also suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doctors later discovered she actually had [[Dementia with Lewy bodies|Lewy body dementia]]; both the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diagnoses were incorrect.<ref name="getty-faq"/> In 2003, [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime]] television hosted a ''Golden Girls'' reunion, but Getty did not appear due to her failing health.

===Death===
{{Wikinewspar|American actress Estelle Getty dead at age 84}}
On [[July 22]] [[2008]], at approximately 5:30 a.m. [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]], Getty died in her Hollywood Boulevard home in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] from natural causes (according to her manager).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ktla.trb.com/news/ktla-estelle-getty,0,3680212.story|title='Golden Girl' Estelle Getty Dead at 84|date=2008-07-22|publisher=KTLA|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/22/estelle.getty.obit/index.html|title=''Golden Girls' actress Estelle Getty dies at 84|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref><ref name="yahooobit">[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080722/tv_nm/getty_dc;_ylt=Ah1c9X6WJYn9dNIcbPpLIARxFb8C Yahoo Entertainment Report: Getty Dies at 84]</ref>

Each of Getty's former ''Golden Girls'' co-stars did not attend Getty's funeral, but did reflect upon her death: [[Rue McClanahan]] told the Associated Press, "Don't feel sad about her passing. She will always be with us in her crowning achievement, Sophia." [[Bea Arthur]] said in a statement, "Our mother-daughter relationship was one of the greatest comic duos ever, and I will miss her." [[Betty White]] remarked, "The only comfort at this moment is that although Estelle has moved on, Sophia will always be with us."<ref name="yahooobit" />

In honor of Getty, Lifetime TV &ndash; which airs ''The Golden Girls'' &ndash; aired ten episodes of the series featuring the best of Sophia on Friday, [[July 25]]. Fans voted for their favorite episode on Lifetime's website.  The episode "Old Friends" received the most votes and was aired last during the marathon.
