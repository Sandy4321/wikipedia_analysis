The '''Fin Whale''' (''Balaenoptera physalus''), also called the '''Finback Whale''', '''Razorback''', or '''Common Rorqual''', is a marine [[mammal]] belonging to the suborder of [[baleen whale]]s. It is the second largest whale and the second largest living animal after the [[Blue Whale]],<ref name="marinebio">{{cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=40|title=''Balaenoptera physalus'' Fin Whale|publisher=MarineBio.org|accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> growing to nearly 27&nbsp;[[meter]]s (88&nbsp;[[foot (length)|ft]]) long.<ref name="marinebio"/>

Long and slender, the Fin Whale's body is brownish-grey with a paler underside. There are at least two distinct subspecies: the Northern Fin Whale of the North Atlantic, and the larger Antarctic Fin Whale of the [[Southern Ocean]]. It is found in all the world's major oceans, from [[polar region|polar]] to [[tropics|tropical]] waters. It is absent only from waters close to the [[Polar ice packs|ice pack]] at both the [[North Pole|north]] and [[South Pole|south]] poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in [[temperateness|temperate]] and cool waters.<ref name="nmfs">{{cite book|author=National Marine Fisheries Service | year = 2006 | title=Draft recovery plan for the fin whale (''Balaenoptera physalus'')| publisher = National Marine Fisheries Service | location = Silver Spring, Maryland | url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/draft_finwhale.pdf | format = pdf}}</ref>
Its food consists of small [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] fish, [[squid]], and [[crustacean]]s including [[Mysidacea|mysids]] and [[krill]].

Like all other large whales, the Fin Whale was heavily hunted during the twentieth century and is an [[endangered species]]. Almost 750,000 Fin Whales were taken from the Southern Hemisphere alone between 1904 and 1979<ref>http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=89</ref> and less than 3,000 currently remain. <ref>http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/scotia/gooant/gooant070204.htm</ref> The [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) has issued a moratorium on commercial hunting of this whale,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/rms.htm | title = Revised Management Scheme | publisher = [[International Whaling Commission]] | accessdate = 2006-11-07}}</ref> although [[Iceland]] and [[Japan]] have announced intentions to resume hunting, the latter country stating it will kill a quota of 50 whales for the 2008 season. The species is also hunted by Greenlanders under the Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling provisions of the IWC. Collisions with ships and noise from human activity are also significant threats to the recovery of the species.

==Taxonomy==
{{seealso|Evolution of cetaceans}}
[[Image:Rorqual phylogenetic tree.svg|left|thumbnail|A [[cladistics|cladogram]] of animals related to the Fin Whale]]
The Fin Whale has long been known to [[taxonomy|taxonomist]]s, first described by Frederick Martens in 1675 and then again by [[Paul Dudley]] in 1725. These descriptions were used as the basis of [[Carl Linnaeus]]' ''Balaena physalus'' (1758).<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Fin Whales are [[rorqual]]s (family [[rorqual#taxonomy|Balaenopteridae]]), a family that includes the [[Humpback Whale]], the [[Blue Whale]], the [[Bryde's Whale]], the [[Sei Whale]] and the [[Minke Whale]]. The family [[rorqual|Balaenopteridae]] diverged from the other families of the suborder [[baleen whale|Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Miocene]].<ref name="evolution">{{cite book |isbn = 0071427848 | title = McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science & Technology | year = 2004 | publisher = The McGraw Hill Companies | chapter = Whale Evolution | author = Gingerich, P.}}</ref> However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.

As of 2006, there are two named [[subspecies]], each with distinct physical features and vocalizations. ''B. p. physalus'' (Linnaeus 1758), or Northern Fin Whale, is found in the North Atlantic, and ''B. p. quoyi'' (Fischer 1829), or Antarctic Fin Whale, is found in the [[Southern Ocean]].<ref name="itis">{{ITIS | ID = 180527 | taxon = Balaenoptera physalus | year = 2006 | date = 23 October}}</ref> Most experts consider the Fin Whales of the North Pacific to be a third unnamed subspecies.<ref name="nmfs"/> On a global scale, the three groups rarely mix, if at all.
<br style="clear:both" />

==Description and behavior==

The Fin Whale is usually distinguished by its great length and slender build. The average size of males and females is 19 and 20&nbsp;meters (62 and 66&nbsp;ft), respectively. Subspecies in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] are known to reach lengths of up to 24&nbsp;meters (79&nbsp;ft), and the Antarctic subspecies reaches lengths of up to 26.8&nbsp;meters (88&nbsp;ft).<ref name="marinebio"/> A full-sized adult has never been weighed, but calculations suggest that a 25&nbsp;meter (82&nbsp;ft) animal could weigh as much as 70,000&nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (154,000&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]). Full physical [[sexual maturity|maturity]] is not attained until between 25 and 30 years, although Fin Whales have been known to live to 94 years of age.<ref name="martin">{{cite book | last=Martin | first=Anthony R. | title=Whales and dolphins | publisher=Salamander Books | location=London | year=1991}}</ref> A newborn Fin Whale measures about 6.5&nbsp;meters (21&nbsp;ft) in length and weighs approximately 1,800&nbsp;kilograms (4,000&nbsp;lb).<ref name="ADW">{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Balaenoptera_physalus.html|title=Balaenoptera physalus (fin whale)|publisher=Animal Diversity Web|author=Fox, David|accessdate=2006-10-22|year=2001}}</ref> The animal's large size aids in identification, and it is usually only confused with the [[Blue Whale]], the [[Sei Whale]], or, in warmer waters, [[Bryde's Whale]].

The Fin Whale has a brownish grey top and sides and a whitish underside. It has a pointed snout, paired [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]], and a broad, flat [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]]. Two lighter-colored [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] begin midline behind the blowholes and slant down the sides toward the tail on a diagonal upward to the [[dorsal fin]], sometimes recurving forward on the back.<ref name="marinebio"/> It has a large white patch on the right side of the lower jaw, while the left side of the jaw is grey or black.<ref name="ADW"/> This type of [[asymmetry]] can be seen occasionally in [[Minke Whale]]s, but the Fin Whale's asymmetry is universal and thus is unique among [[cetacea]]ns and is one of the keys to making a full identification. It was [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it often circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. There is no accepted hypothesis to explain the asymmetry.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Tershy, B. R.|coauthors=D. Wiley|title=Asymmetrical pigmentation in the fin whale: a test of two feeding related hypotheses|year=1992|journal=Marine Mammal Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=315<U+2013>318 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1992.tb00416.x}}</ref>

The whale has a series of 56<U+2013>100 [[pleat]]s or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the [[chin]] to the [[navel]] that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent (60&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]], 24 [[inch|in]]) dorsal fin about three-quarters of the way along the back. Its [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] are small and tapered, and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip, and notched in the center.<ref name="marinebio"/>

When the whale surfaces, the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout. The spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of 6&nbsp;meters.<ref name="ADW"/> The whale will blow one to several times on each visit to the surface, staying close to the surface for about one and a half [[minute]]s each time. The tail remains submerged during the surfacing sequence. It then dives to depths of up to 250&nbsp;meters (820&nbsp;ft), each dive lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. Fin Whales have been known to [[whale surfacing behaviour|leap]] completely out of the water.<ref name="ADW"/>

===Life history===
[[Mating]] occurs in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter, and the [[gestation period]] is eleven months to one year. A newborn [[weaning|wean]]s from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is 11 or 12&nbsp;meters (36 to 39&nbsp;ft) in length, and the {{linktext|calf}} follows the mother to the winter feeding ground. Females reproduce every 2 to 3 years, with as many as 6 [[fetus]]es being reported, but single births are far more common. Females reach sexual maturity at between 3 and 12 years of age.<ref name="ADW"/>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Fin Whale feeding.jpg|thumb|Overhead view of a Fin Whale feeding]]
The Fin Whale is a filter-feeder, feeding on small schooling fish, [[squid]], and [[crustacean]]s including [[Mysidacea|mysids]] and [[krill]].<ref name="ADW"/> It feeds by opening its jaws while swimming at a relatively high speed, 11 kilometers per hour (7 mph) in one study,<ref name="ubc07">{{cite web|url = http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/ubcreports/2007/07jun07/whale.html | date = [[2007-06-07]] | publisher = University of British Columbia | title = Whale Has Super-sized Big Gulp | author = Lin, Brian | accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> which causes it to engulf up to {{convert|70|m3|USgal impgal|-3}} of water in one gulp. It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its [[baleen]], which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. Each plate is made of [[keratin]] that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. Each plate can measure up to 76&nbsp;centimeters (30&nbsp;inches) in length and 30&nbsp;centimeters (12&nbsp;inches) in width.<ref name="marinebio"/> The whale routinely dives to depths of more than 200&nbsp;meters (650&nbsp;ft), where it executes an average of four "lunges", where it feeds on aggregations of krill. Each gulp provides the whale with approximately 10&nbsp;kilograms (20&nbsp;lb) of krill.<ref name="ubc07"/> One whale can consume up to 1,800&nbsp;kilograms (4,000&nbsp;lb) of food a day,<ref name="marinebio"/> leading scientists to conclude that the whale spends about three hours of each day feeding to meet its energy requirements, roughly the same as humans. If the prey patches are not sufficiently dense, or are located too deep in the water, the whale has to spend a larger portion of its day searching for food.<ref name="ubc07"/> Fin Whales have also been observed circling schools of fish at high speed, compacting the school into a tight ball, then turning on its side before engulfing the fish.<ref name="marinebio"/>
<br style="clear:left" />

===Behavior===
The Fin Whale is one of the fastest [[cetacea]]ns and can sustain speeds of 37&nbsp;kilometers per hour (23&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]], 20 [[knot (speed)|knots]]),<ref name="ADW"/> and bursts in excess of 40&nbsp;kilometers per hour (25&nbsp;mph, 22 knots) have been recorded, earning the Fin Whale the nickname "the [[greyhound]] of the deep".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.ca/notebooks/english/finwale.htm |title=Fin Whale
|publisher=nature.ca: Canadian Museum of Nature|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>
Fin Whales are more gregarious than other rorquals, and often live in groups of 6<U+2013>10 individuals, although on the feeding grounds aggregations of up to 100 animals may be observed.<ref name="martin" />

When Fin Whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists, researchers did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure, and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, [[geophysics|geophysical]] phenomena, or even part of a [[Soviet Union]] scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of Fin Whales.<ref name=Payne/>

==Habitat and migration==
[[Image:Fin whale from air.jpg|thumb|right|Fin Whales may reach lengths of up to 26.8 meters (88 ft).]]
Like many of the large rorquals, the Fin Whale is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan species]]. It is found in all the world's major oceans, and in waters ranging from the [[Polar region|polar]] to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the [[ice pack]] at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the [[Red Sea]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the eastern part of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and the [[Baltic Sea]]. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the hottest, [[equator]]ial regions. It prefers deep waters beyond the [[continental shelf]] to shallow waters.

The North Atlantic Fin Whale has an extensive distribution, occurring from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], northward to the edges of the Arctic ice pack. In general, Fin Whales are more common north of approximately [[30th parallel north|30<U+00B0>N latitude]], but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30<U+00B0>N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing Fin Whales from Bryde's Whales.<ref name="mead">{{cite journal | author = Mead, J.G. | year = 1977 | journal = Rep.

Although Fin Whales are certainly migratory, moving [[season]]ally in and out of high-latitude feeding areas, the overall migration pattern is not well understood. [[Acoustics|Acoustic]] readings from passive-listening hydrophone arrays indicate a southward migration of the North Atlantic Fin Whale occurs in the autumn from the [[Labrador]]-[[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] region, south past [[Bermuda]], and into the [[Caribbean|West Indies]].<ref name="clark">{{cite journal | author = Clark, C.W. | year = 1995 | title = Application of US Navy underwater hydrophone arrays for scientific research on whales | journal = Rep.

==Abundance and trends==
[[Image:Finwhaleapproach.jpg|thumb|right|A Fin Whale approaching]]
The lack of understanding of the migration pattern of the Fin Whale combined with population surveys that are often contradictory makes estimating the historical and current population levels of the whale difficult and contentious. Due to a long [[History of whaling|history of hunting]] this whale, pre-exploitation population levels are difficult to accurately determine even though estimates are important to measure the rate of recovery of the species.

===North Atlantic===
[[Image:Faroe stamp 401 fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Drawing of a Fin Whale on a [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] stamp, issued 17 September 2001]]

In the North Atlantic, Fin Whales are defined by the [[International Whaling Commission]] to exist in one of seven discrete population zones: [[Nova Scotia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]-[[Labrador]], western [[Greenland]], eastern Greenland-[[Iceland]], North [[Norway]], West Norway-[[Faroe Islands]], and [[Ireland]]-[[Spain]]-[[United Kingdom]]-[[Portugal]]. Results of mark-and-recapture surveys have indicated that some movement occurs across the boundaries of these population zones, suggesting that each zone is not entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur.<ref name="mitchell 1974"/> J.

Relatively little is known about the historical and current population levels of the Antarctic Fin Whale.

[[Image:Captured fin whale.jpg|thumb|A Fin Whale caught at [[Grays Harbor]] circa 1912]]
In the 19th century, the Fin Whale was occasionally hunted by the open-boat [[whaling|whalers]], but it was relatively safe because of its quick speed and the fact that it often sank when killed. However, the introduction of steam-powered boats in the second half of that century and [[harpoon]]s that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure Blue Whales, Fin Whales, and Sei Whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became over-hunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant Fin Whale as a substitute.<ref name="acs">{{cite web| url=http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/finwhl.htm| title=American Cetacean Society Fact Sheet: Fin Whale, ''Balaenoptera physalus''| publisher=American Cetacean Society| accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> It was primarily hunted for its [[blubber]], [[whale oil|oil]], and baleen.

Commn |title=Report of the scientific committee |volume=45 |year=1995 |pages=53<U+2013>221}}</ref> After the introduction of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925, the number of whales taken per year increased substantially. In 1937 alone, over 28,000 Fin Whales were taken. From 1953 to 1961, whaling of the species averaged around 25,000 per year. By 1962, [[Sei Whale]] catches began to increase as Fin Whales became scarce. By 1974, fewer than 1,000 Fin Whales were being caught each year. The IWC prohibited the taking of Fin Whales from the southern hemisphere in 1976.<ref name="IWC90"/> In the North Pacific, a reported total of approximately 46,000 Fin Whales were killed by commercial whalers between 1947 and 1987.<ref name="barlow97">{{cite paper | author = Barlow, J., K.

The Fin Whale is hunted in the Northern Hemisphere in [[Greenland]], under the International Whaling Commission's procedure for aboriginal subsistence whaling. Meat and other products from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within the Greenland economy, but export is illegal. The IWC has set a quota of 19 Fin Whales per year for Greenland despite concern about uncertainty of current population levels. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to the moratorium.<ref name="nmfs"/> In October 2006, Iceland's fisheries ministry authorized the hunting of nine Fin Whales through August 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a4fs59pxIqXI&refer=europe|date=2006-10-18|accessdate=2006-10-23|title=Iceland to Resume Whale Hunting, Defying Global Ban |publisher=Bloomberg.com}}</ref> In the southern hemisphere, [[Japan]] has targeted Fin Whales in its Antarctic Special Permit whaling program for the 2005<U+2013>2006 and 2006<U+2013>2007 seasons at 10 whales killed per year.<ref name="usinfo">{{cite web | url=http://usinfo.state.gov/xarchives/display.html?p=washfile-english&y=2006&m=November&x=20061120171913lcnirellep0.9033319 | title = U.S. Protests Japan<U+2019>s Announced Return to Whaling in Antarctic | publisher = Bureau of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State | date = 20 November 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-27 }}</ref> The proposal for 2007<U+2013>2008 and the subsequent 12 seasons includes 50 Fin Whales per year,<ref name="nmfs"/> but by the close of the 2007-2008 season in April 2008, no fin whales had been caught.<ref name="dominion08">{{cite web|url = http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/dominionpost/4590109a26386.html | title = Less food for hungry migrants | publisher = The Dominion Post | date= 21 June 2008 | accessdate = 2008-06-21 }}</ref>

Collisions with ships are an additional major cause of Fin Whale mortality. In some areas, they represent a substantial portion of the strandings of large whales. Most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large, fast-moving ships over or near the [[continental shelf]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Laist, D.W.|coauthors=Knowlton, A.R., Mead, J.G., Collet A.S., and Podesta, M.|year=2001|journal=Marine Mammal Science|title=Collisions between ships and whales|volume=17|pages=35<U+2013>75|url=http://www.nero.noaa.gov/shipstrike/whatsnew/Laist%20et%20al_2001.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2001.tb00980.x}}</ref>
