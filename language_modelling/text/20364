Harris was named to the 2009 Consensus Draft Services Preseason All-American Team.   He was the first player to repeat as [[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference|PSAC]] West Offensive Player of the Year since [[Randy McKavish]] of [[Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania|Slippery Rock]] won the honor in 1997 and again in 1998. He was a three-time All-PSAC West selection and was the PSAC West Rookie of the Year as a freshman.<ref name=Profile/>
