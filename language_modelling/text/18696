The '''Kinston Indians''' are a [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] [[baseball]] team in [[Kinston, North Carolina]]. The team, a [[Minor league baseball#Levels of competition|High-A]] affiliate of the [[Cleveland Indians]], plays in the [[Carolina League]]. Professional baseball in Kinston dates back to {{by|1908}} when they fielded a team in the [[Eastern Carolina League]].<ref name="Spalding1909"/> Kinston adopted the name "Indians" at the start of their relationship with [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], in {{by|1987}}. They are currently one of the oldest and most successful franchises in their circuit.

== History ==
===Early years===

Baseball has been popular in Kinston since the late nineteenth century, and it fielded many excellent amateur clubs. Despite this, the small city was unable to sustain a viable professional team until the mid-1920s.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Dalimonte  | first = David E. | title = Kinston Has a Rich Tradition in Baseball | url=http://www.kinstonindians.com/history/tradition.php | accessdate = 2007-07-27 }}</ref> Earlier attempts included an aborted campaign in the [[Minor league baseball#Defunct levels|Class D]] [[Eastern Carolina League]] in {{by|1908}}<ref name="Spalding1909">{{Cite conference  | last =Moore  | first =Louis T.  | contribution =Eastern Carolina League  | year =1909  | title =Spalding's Official Base Ball Guide  | editor-last =Foster  | editor-first =John B.  | volume =34  | pages =252<U+2013>253  | place=New York, N.Y.  | publisher =American Sports Publishing Company  }}</ref> and an "[[Independent league baseball|outlaw league]]" team in {{by|1921}} and {{by|1922}}. The latter was notable for being managed by former major league pitcher [[George Suggs]] and [[College Football Hall of Fame]] member [[Ira Rodgers]].<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Anon.  | title=College Coach Is New Manager Local Club; Suggs Quits | newspaper=Kinston Free Press  | year=1922  | date=June 15, 1922 }}</ref> Due to the efforts of the city's business leaders, former local amateur star Elisha Lewis, and George Suggs, the town secured a team in the [[Virginia League]] for the {{by|1925}} season.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Anon.  | title=Kinston Takes A Franchise In Virginia League; Plans To Buy Petersburg Players | newspaper=Kinston Free Press  | year=1924  | date=December 16, 1924 }}</ref>

Despite their lack of wins, the team was successful enough at the gate that they proved the town was capable of sustaining a professional team. Kinston stayed three years in the Virginia League and then moved on to a newly reformed Eastern Carolina League. This later affiliation would collapse along with the stock market in {{by|1929}}.<ref>{{cite book | author=Chrisman, David F.| title=The History of the Virginia League | publisher=Maverick Publications | year=1988 | id=[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006EQIN8/ ASIN B0006EQIN8] }}</ref> Among the members of these 1920s Eagles teams was a young catcher named [[Rick Ferrell]] who would have a long playing career and even longer front office career in the major leagues.

===Coastal Plain League===

Kinston was without a team for the first few years of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], but by {{by|1934}}, the city found its way into the semi-professional [[Coastal Plain League (semi pro)|Coastal Plain League]]. In {{by|1937}}, this loop became [[Coastal Plain League (Class D)|fully professional]] and was classified as a [[Minor league baseball#Defunct levels|Class D]] league by the [[National Association]].<ref>{{cite book  | last =Johnson  | first =Lloyd  | coauthors =Miles Wolff  | title =The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball, second ed. | publisher =Baseball America, Inc. | date =1997  | location =Durham, North Carolina  | isbn =0-963-71898-3  | page=295 }}</ref> The city would stay in this league every season until it was finally disbanded following the {{by|1952}} campaign. It was as a member of this affiliation that Kinston saw many playoff appearances and two league championships ({{by|1935}} and {{by|1947}}). Among the superior talent that entertained the fans of Kinston was a young player named [[Charlie Keller|Charlie "King Kong" Keller]] who remains within the top forty major league players of all-time in terms of [[on base percentage]] (.410).<ref>{{cite book  | last =Gaunt  | first =Robert  | title =We Would Have Played Forever: The Story of the Coastal Plain Baseball League   | publisher =Baseball America, Inc.   | date =1997  | location =Durham, N.C.  | isbn =0-945-16402-5  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | last = Baseball-Reference.com  | title = Charlie Keller Statistics  | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/kellech01.shtml | accessdate = 2007-07-27 }}</ref>

===Carolina League===

[[Image:Carl Long.jpg|thumb|90px|left|Carl Long <U+2013> 2006]]For three years following the dissolution of the Coastal Plain League, Kinston found itself without a team until the owner of the [[Burlington Bees]] of the [[Carolina League]] moved his team to Kinston for the {{by|1956}} season. At the time, the Carolina League was a [[Minor league baseball#Defunct levels|Class B]] loop with teams located in [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys: The First Half-Century of the Carolina League | publisher=John F.

In these early days of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the black players in the Carolina League received much verbal and psychological abuse from the largely white, Southern fan base.<ref>{{cite book | author=Snyder, Brad | title=A Well-Paid Slave | publisher=Viking | year=2006 | pages=43<U+2013>48 | isbn=0-670-03794-X }}</ref> One of these first black Kinston ball players, [[Carl Long (baseball)|Carl Long]], would excel during the 1956 season and set an [[Run batted in|RBI]] standard (111) that would never be surpassed by any of the Kinston hitters who have come after him.<ref>{{cite book | author=Kelley, Brent | title=The Negro Leagues Revisited | publisher=McFarland & Company | year=2000 | pages=303<U+2013>308 | isbn=0-786-40875-8 }}</ref> The other racial pioneer for Kinston baseball was [[Frank Washington]], a holdover from the {{by|1955}} Burlington team.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=United Press  | title=Hitters Have Big Night as Play Gets Underway in Carolina Loop | newspaper=Kinston Free Press  | year=1956  | date=April 19, 1956 }}</ref> Kinston's owner was an inept businessman who brought the club near bankruptcy before it was moved to [[Wilson, North Carolina|Wilson]] in {{by|1957}}.<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys | publisher=John F.

Kinston's re-entry into Carolina League baseball in {{by|1962}} was successful both on the field and at the turnstile. The Eagles were able to claim the first of its Carolina League crowns. At a time when Kinston's population was only 25,000, the ball club was  able to attract over 140,000 fans. Part of the lure for these fans was the talent supplied by Kinston's parent club, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], which included [[Steve Blass]] (17<U+2013>3, 1.97 [[Earned run average|ERA]], 209 [[Strikeout|K's]]), and [[Frank Bork]] (19<U+2013>7, 2.00 ERA).<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys | publisher=John F. Blair | year=1994 | pages=89<U+2013>95 | isbn=0-895-87112-2 }}</ref> Another attraction for the fans was that for the first time, the Eagles were a community owned team. The Kinston Eagles Baseball Company was a non-profit organization run by an elected eighteen man, unpaid board of directors. Profits went back into improving the stadium, promoting the team, and supplying playing equipment for the youth of Kinston. This arrangement would continue through all thirteen years of Kinston's second tenure in the Carolina League from {{by|1962}} through {{by|1974}}.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Expos  | title = The Fans Own The Expos  | journal = Kinston Expos 1974 Souvenir Scorebook  | pages = 10  | year = 1974 }}</ref>

[[Image:68sked.jpg|thumb|90px|right|1968 pocket schedule.]]With the reclassification of minor league baseball in {{by|1963}}, the Carolina League became a [[Minor league baseball#Levels of competition|High-A]] circuit. The Eagles would fail to win any more championships during this second period of Carolina League play, but they managed to make the playoffs following six of the thirteen seasons. The Pirates stuck with Kinston through the {{by|1965}} campaign, and the Eagles were managed by [[Harding "Pete" Peterson]] during three of those four seasons. Pete would later oversee the Pirates [[farm system]] and become the Pirates' general manager, helping to build the late seventies team that won the [[World Series]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys | publisher=John F.

During the 1970s the popularity of minor league baseball reached its lowest point and the attendance in Kinston fell to only 30,000 for the {{by|1973}} season. The city needed a revival of interest, and the [[Montreal Expos|Expos]] were turned to for help. The young Montreal franchise boasted a strong farm system with a lot of talent. So much talent in fact, that they decided to experiment with having two High A affiliates. Instead of dividing the players evenly between the two High A teams, the [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] club ended up with all the best men while the newly renamed Kinston Expos had to make due with castoffs. The Kinston team soon found itself overmatched among its Carolina League rivals. The Expos fell to last place and attendance fell to only 27,000 for the year. Montreal declared their experiment a failure and withdrew from Kinston following the {{by|1974}} season. With no major league sponsor and very little fan support, Kinston withdrew from the league.<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys | publisher=John F. Blair | year=1994 | pages=140<U+2013>142 | isbn=0-895-87112-2 }}</ref>

Former airline pilot [[Ray Kuhlman]] brought minor league baseball back to Kinston by investing in a Carolina League franchise in the late seventies. The renamed Kinston Eagles flew unaffiliated their first season back in the circuit in {{by|1978}}. By the next campaign, they were associated with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Toronto stayed with Kinston for seven years, and the team eventually took on the Blue Jay name. Kinston did not win any championships during the Blue Jays years. Kuhlman and his wife ran the team themselves and oversaw steady annual increases in attendance each year. They brought a string of marketing ideas that have taken hold and remain to this day. These included increased promotional days, fireworks displays, the introduction of Kinston [[baseball card]]s, an increase in branded souvenir merchandise, the establishment of the [[Kinston Indians#Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame|Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame]], and the hiring of a team mascot. Also attracting fans was a collection of future major league stars including [[Tony Fern<U+00E1>ndez]], [[Fred McGriff]], and [[Cecil Fielder]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Sumner, Jim L.| title=Separating the Men From the Boys | publisher=John F. Blair | year=1994 | pages=150<U+2013>186 | isbn=0-895-87112-2 }}</ref>

Following the {{by|1985}} season, the Blue Jays dropped Kinston as a franchise, and professional baseball in the city seemed to be in doubt once again. There was talk of moving the franchise to [[Charles County, Maryland]], but the city remained in the Carolina League with an independent ball club that took on the Eagles name. {{by|1986}} proved to be disappointing in the standings and at the gate, and talk of a move was renewed, but ownership secured an affiliation with the [[Cleveland Indians]] during the off season.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Greenwell | first=Megan  | title=Charles Scores One For the Home Team:

Six figure attendance totals became the norm throughout the 1990s and into the new century. General Manager North Johnson fostered closer bonds with the mayor's office and helped create the Mayor's Committee for Professional Baseball in {{by|1987}}.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = Mayor's Committee For Professional Baseball  | journal = Kinston Indians 1987 Souvenir Program  | pages = 24  | year = 1987 }}</ref> Dedicated to increasing season ticket sales and promoting ties with businesses, the committee accomplished much in a short span of time.

In {{by|2007}}, the Indians won the Southern Division crown for both halves of the year, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the wildcard team, the [[Salem Avalanche]]. It was the seventh season in a row that they made the post season which is a new Carolina League record formerly held by the [[Burlington Bees]] ({{by|1945}}<U+2013>{{by|1950}}). It was the second time a Kinston team has accomplished this feat. The Kinston Eagles of the Coastal Plain League also made it to seven post seasons in a row ({{by|1946}}<U+2013>{{by|1952}}).<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Anon.  | title=K-Tribe clinches first-half title  | newspaper=[[The Goldsboro News-Argus]]  | year=2007  | date=June 14, 2007   | url=http://www.newsargus.com/sports/archives/2007/06/14/ktribe_clinches_firsthalf_title/index.shtml }}</ref> It was announced in June 2008 that Kinston's player development contract with Cleveland has been extended through the 2010 season.

==Grainger Stadium==

{{Main|Grainger Stadium}}

[[Image:Compressed374.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Grainger Grandstand, 2006.]]The Kinston Indians, and all the Kinston teams since 1949, have played their home games at '''Grainger Stadium''' located at 400 East Grainger Avenue in Kinston. The original structure was built by architect John J. Rowland in 1949 at a cost of one hundred seventy thousand dollars inclusive of everything except the land. One hundred fifty thousand dollars of the money was raised by bond issue.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =Mock, Jr.  | first =Frank L.  | title =Kinston's New Stadium  | journal =Athletic Journal  | volume =XXX  | issue =10  | pages =14  | date =June 1950  | year =1950  }}</ref> The stadium is owned by the city and leased by the team.

It is currently the second oldest stadium in the circuit. The name Grainger comes from its location on Grainger Avenue as well as its use early on by Grainger High School. Grainger is a prominent old family name in [[Lenoir County, North Carolina|Lenoir County]].

==Annual Awards==

Each year, usually on the weekend of the last home games, the Kinston Indians present awards to those deserving. The team [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] Award was named in honor of [[Pat Crawford (baseball)|"Cap'n Pat" Crawford]]. Crawford was a longtime Kinston resident who made it to the major leagues with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] during the [[Gashouse Gang]] era.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = Pat Crawford MVP Award  | journal = Kinston Indians 1989 Souvenir Program  | pages = 23  | year = 1989 }}</ref>

[[Steve Olin]] was a right-handed [[submarine (baseball)|submarining]] [[relief pitcher]] for Kinston who had moved up to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was killed in a boating accident during [[spring training]] of 1993 in [[Winter Haven, Florida]]. The boat he was in struck a pier, killing him and fellow reliever [[Tim Crews]] and seriously injuring [[Bob Ojeda]]. Kinston's annual award for Pitcher of the Year was named in his honor. 

The award given each year to the player who had to overcome the greatest adversity in his career was named in honor of Tex Drake. Drake was one of the [[batboy]]s for the Kinston Blue Jays starting with the {{by|1982}} season. On the last day of the {{by|1984}} campaign, he found out that he had [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's Disease]] which had advanced to all four stages. The club president, Gary Fitzpatrick, arranged for Drake to work as a batboy for the last three home games of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] season. Once back in Kinston, Drake was able to overcome his cancer through [[chemotherapy]] and return to his duties on the field.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Drake  | first = Tex  | title = My Weekend In Toronto: A Dream Comes True For The Blue Jays Batboy  | journal = The 1985 Kinston Blue Jays Souvenir Program  | pages = 41  | year = 1985 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = The Tex Drake Award  | journal = Kinston Indians 1989 Souvenir Program  | pages = 26  | year = 1989 }}</ref>

The Kinston player who best represents good [[sportsmanship]] is given an award named for Steve Gaydek. Gaydek was a former member of the club's Board of Directors who became a lifelong fan of Kinston's baseball teams. He attended every home game for over twenty years even though he lived over thirty miles from the ballpark.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = Steve Gaydek Award  | journal = Kinston Indians 1989 Souvenir Program  | pages = 27  | year = 1989 }}</ref>

Lewis B. "Mac" McAvery was the head [[groundskeeper]] from {{by|1949}} to his death in {{by|1979}}. In honor of his accomplishments, the team established an award in his name to be given to the individual who has done the most to "preserve and enhance" professional baseball in Kinston.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = The Lewis B.

==Mascots==

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Klogos.JPG|thumb|140px|right|Current Kinston logos|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 26 October 2007}}]] -->The Indians' [[mascot]] is a dog named Scout. Scout can usually be found in an Indians jersey and [[baseball cap]], but has also been known to don a [[Superman]] [[t-shirt]] or an [[aloha shirt]] depending on the antics he is performing. Scout replaced an earlier [[Native American in the United States|Native American]] mascot who was named Tom E. Hawk.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Whisnant  | first=Gabe  | title=K-Tribe mascot is a hit  | newspaper=[[The Goldsboro News-Argus]]  | year=2006  | date=July 23, 2006   | url=http://www.newsargus.com/sports/archives/2006/07/23/ktribe_mascot_is_a_hit/index.shtml }}</ref> Although Tom E. Hawk no longer greets fans in person at the ballpark, he can still be seen in several of the official logos on much of the team merchandise. His broadly smiling visage is very reminiscent of Cleveland's [[Chief Wahoo]].

During the days when Kinston was a [[Toronto Blue Jays]] affiliate, the team had a bird mascot named B.J..<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Kinston Blue Jays  | title = Blue Jay Staff | journal = Kinston Blue Jays 1984 Souvenir Program  | pages = 3  | year = 1984 }}</ref> {{by|1980}} manager [[Dennis Holmberg]] once resorted to dressing up in the mascot's costume so that he could return to the [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]] undetected after being [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] from a game.<ref>{{cite book | author=Klein, Jeff | title=Diamond Days: Life In Minor League Baseball | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | year=2004 | isbn=1-413-43365-0 | page=78 }}</ref> For the {{by|1983}} season, the Blue Jays had a dozen teenage girls, known as the [[Golden Corral]] Lady Jays, in the stadium.

== Local baseball personalities==

{{see also|List of Kinston baseball people}}

*'''Chris Hemeyer''': Hemeyer is the radio voice of the Indians as well as the host of ''Tribe Talk''. ''Tribe Talk'' is an interview television program shown on local [[Public-access television|public access]] stations in southeastern [[North Carolina]]. Besides interviewing team members and staff, the show also has highlights of recent Kinston games. First run episodes air once a week during the season. ''Tribe Talk'' is currently in its third season of production.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Kinston Indians  | title = Tribe Talk Returns To Television  | url=http://www.kinstonindians.com/news/show_news.asp?article_id=919 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927134231/http://www.kinstonindians.com/news/show_news.asp?article_id=919|archivedate=27 September 2007|accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref>

*'''Team Mamas''': Anne "Mama" Robinson and Evelyn "Mama" Kornegay are local residents of Kinston who have hosted players during their stay in Kinston. Mama Robinson hosted players for the first eleven years of the current franchise (1987<U+2013>1997),<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rada  | first1 = Joe  | title = Dreaming Big in the Carolina League  | journal = Southern Living  | volume = 32  | issue = 6  | pages = 16cl-27cl  | date = 1997-06-01  | year = 1997 }}</ref> while Mama Kornegay has taken over the duties since.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Neff  | first=Eric  | title=In Kinston: 'Mama' always has room for her players | newspaper=Jacksonville Daily News  | year=2006  | date=August 17, 2006  }}</ref> Although only a few of the team members live in the house at any one time, the homes have become popular gathering places and a home away from home for the club. Prior to the current arrangement, players had some difficulty establishing a stable environment in which to live. In his autobiography, [[Ron Guidry]] relates how his rented mobile home was sold out from under him while he was gone on Reserve duty.<ref>{{cite book | author=Guidry, Ron and Peter Golenbock| title=Guidry | publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. | year=1980 | pages =72<U+2013>74 | isbn=0-13-371609-0 }}</ref> [[David Wells]] tells similar stories of being bounced around from place to place during his time in Kinston.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Wells  | first =David  | authorlink =David Wells  | coauthors =Chris Kreski  | title=Perfect I'm Not: Boomer on Beer, Brawls, Backaches, and Baseball  | publisher=HarperCollins Publishers, Inc.  | date =2003  | location =New York  | pages =67<U+2013>69  | isbn =0-060-50824-8  }}</ref>

*'''Delmont Miller''': (March 30, 1966 <U+2013> October 25, 2008): Miller was the longtime [[scoreboard]] operator for the Indians. His humorous first inning chatter and "[[shout-out]]s" prior to each "KTribe" game had become a tradition at Grainger Stadium. Recognizing the popularity of Delmont with both the fans and the players, the Kinston front office held special "Delmont Miller Nights" the past few seasons and built promotions around his unique personality. His twenty-plus year career at the stadium spanned several ownerships and even major league affiliation changes. Prior to becoming the scoreboard operator, he was the clubhouse assistant for the [[Kinston Blue Jays]]. His first name came from his father's love of [[Del Monte]] brand peaches.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Winston  | first = Lisa  | title = Indians Scoreboard Operator Became a Legend in Carolina League  | publisher = [[Minor League Baseball]]  | date = 2006-09-10  | url = http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060910&content_id=130775&vkey=news_milb&fext=.jsp  | accessdate = 2007-07-01 }}</ref> On October 25, 2008, the 42 year-old Miller died of a massive heart attack.

*'''The Smeraldos''': Robert Smeraldo and Robert Smeraldo Jr. are the longtime father/son clubhouse managers for the ballclub. The senior Smeraldo has entered his fifteenth season of tending to the home clubhouse while his son takes care of the needs of the visiting team in their clubhouse.<ref>{{Cite news  | last=Hall  | first=David  | title=Keeping the Indians up and running | newspaper=Kinston Free Press  | year=2006  | date=July 28, 2006  }}</ref>
