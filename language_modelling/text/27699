[[Image:Sperm-egg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Successful reproductive sex in animals results in the fusion of a [[spermatozoan|sperm]] and [[egg cell]].]]
In [[biology]], '''sex''' is a process of combining and mixing [[genetics|genetic]] traits, often resulting in the specialization of [[organism]]s into a [[male]] or [[female]] variety (known as a '''sex'''). [[Sexual reproduction]] involves combining specialized [[Cell (biology)|cells]] ([[gamete]]s) to form offspring that inherit traits from both parents. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogametes), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist: [[male]] gametes are small, motile, and optimized to transport their genetic information over a distance, while [[female]] gametes are large, non-motile and contain the nutrients necessary for the early development of the young organism.

An organism's sex is defined by the gametes it produces: males produce male gametes (spermatozoa, or [[sperm]]) while females produce female gametes (ova, or [[egg cell]]s); individual organisms which produce both male and female gametes are termed [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]. Frequently, physical differences are associated with the different sexes of an organism; these [[sexual dimorphism]]s can reflect the different reproductive pressures the sexes experience.

==Sexual reproduction==
{{main|sexual reproduction}}
[[Image:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|200px|right|The life cycle of sexually reproducing organisms cycles through haploid and diploid stages.]]
Sexual reproduction is a process where organisms form offspring that combine genetic traits from both parents. Chromosomes are passed on from one parent to another in this process. Each cell has half the chromosomes of the mother and half of the father.<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002),
 U.S. National Institutes of Health,
 "[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=<!--
 -->mboc4.section.3678 V. 20. The Benefits of Sex]".</ref>
Genetic traits are contained within the [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]] of [[chromosome]]s <U+2014> by combining one of each type of chromosomes from each parent, an organism is formed containing a doubled set of chromosomes. This double-chromosome stage is called "[[diploid]]", while the single-chromosome stage is "[[haploid]]". Diploid organisms can, in turn, form haploid cells ([[gametes]]) that randomly contain one of each of the chromosome pairs, via a process called [[meiosis]].<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002), "V. 20. Meiosis", U.S. NIH,
 webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=mboc4.section.3686 V. 20. Meiosis].</ref>
Meiosis also involves a stage of [[chromosomal crossover]], in which regions of DNA are exchanged between matched types of chromosomes, to form a new pair of mixed chromosomes. [[chromosomal crossover|Crossing over]] and [[fertilization]] (the recombining of single sets of chromosomes to make a new diploid) result in the new organism containing a different set of genetic traits from either parent.

In many organisms, the haploid stage has been reduced to just [[gamete]]s specialized to recombine and form a new diploid organism; in others, the gametes are capable of undergoing [[mitosis|cell division]] to produce [[multicellular]] haploid organisms. In either case, gametes may be externally similar, particularly in size ([[isogamy]]), or may have [[evolution|evolved]] an asymmetry such that the gametes are different in size and other aspects ([[anisogamy]]).<ref>

 Differentiation", NIH,
 webpage:[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=dbio.section.203 1.2.Mul].</ref>
By convention, the larger gamete (called an ovum, or [[egg cell]]) is considered female, while the smaller gamete (called a spermatozoon, or [[sperm]] cell) is considered male. An individual that produces exclusively large gametes is [[female]], and one that produces exclusively small gametes is [[male]]. An individual that produces both types of gametes is a [[hermaphrodite]]; in some cases hermaphrodites are able to [[self-fertilization|self-fertilize]] and produce offspring on their own, without a second organism.<ref>

===Animals===
[[Image:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] engaging in [[sexual intercourse]]]]
Most sexually reproducing animals spend their lives as diploid organisms, with the haploid stage reduced to single cell gametes.<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002), "3. Mendelian genetics in
 eukaryotic life cycles", U.S. NIH,
 webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=iga.section.484 3. Mendelian/eukaryotic].</ref>
The gametes of animals have male and female forms<U+2014>[[spermatozoa]] and [[egg cell]]s. These gametes combine to form embryos which develop into a new organism.

The male gamete, a [[spermatozoan]] (produced within a [[testicle]]), is a small cell containing a single long [[flagellum]] which propels it.<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Sperm", U.S. NIH,
 webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=mboc4.section.3729 V.20. Sperm].</ref>
Spermatozoa are extremely reduced cells, lacking many cellular components that would be necessary for embryonic development. They are specialized for motility, seeking out an egg cell and fusing with it in a process called [[Fertilization#Fertilisation in animals|fertilization]].

Female gametes are [[egg cell]]s (produced within [[ovary|ovaries]]), large immobile cells that contain the nutrients and cellular components necessary for a developing embryo.<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Eggs", U.S. NIH,
 webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=mboc4.section.3718 V.20. Eggs].</ref>
Egg cells are often associated with other cells which support the development of the embryo, forming an [[Egg (biology)|egg]]. In mammals, the fertilized embryo instead develops within the female, receiving nutrition directly from its mother.

Animals are usually mobile and seek out a partner of the opposite sex for [[mating]]. Animals which live in the water can mate using [[external fertilization]], where the eggs and sperm are released into and combine within the surrounding water.<ref>
 Alberts et al. (2002), "V.20. Fertilization", U.S. NIH,
 webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?<!--
 -->rid=mboc4.section.3738 V.20. Fertilization].</ref>
Most animals that live outside of water, however, must transfer sperm from male to female to achieve [[internal fertilization]].

In most birds, both excretion and reproduction is done through a single posterior opening, called the [[cloaca]]<U+2014>male and female birds touch cloaca to transfer sperm, a process called "cloacal kissing".<ref>{{cite web| title=Avian Reproduction| url=http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/avianreproduction.html| publisher=Eastern Kentucky University| author=Ritchison G| accessdate=2008-04-03}}</ref> In many other terrestrial animals, males use specialized sex organs to assist the transport of sperm<U+2014>these male sex organs are called [[intromittent organ]]s. In humans and other mammals this male organ is the [[penis]], which enters the female reproductive tract (called the [[vagina]]) to achieve [[insemination]]<U+2014>a process called [[sexual intercourse]]. The penis contains a tube through which [[semen]] (a fluid containing sperm) travels. In female mammals the vagina connects with the [[uterus]], an organ which directly supports the development of a fertilized embryo within (a process called [[gestation]]).

Because of their motility, [[Animal sexual behaviour|animal sexual behavior]] can involve coercive sex. [[Traumatic insemination]], for example, is used by some insect species to inseminate females through a wound in the abdominal cavity - a process detrimental to the female's health.

===Plants===
[[Image:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants, usually containing both male and female parts.]]

{{main|Plant reproduction}}
Like animals, plants have developed specialized male and female gametes.<ref>
 Gilbert (2000), "4.20. Gamete Production in Angiosperms",
 U.S. NIH, webpage: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/<!--
 -->bv.fcgi?rid=dbio.section.4948 4.20. Gamete/Angio.].</ref>
Within most familiar plants, male gametes are contained within hard coats, forming [[pollen]]. The female gametes of plants are contained within [[ovule]]s; once fertilized by pollen these form [[seed]]s which, like eggs, contain the nutrients necessary for the development of the embryonic plant.

<div class="thumb tright" style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin:0.5em;">
{|border="0" width=260 border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="font-size: 85%; border: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin: 0.3em;"

|}
<div style="border: none; width:260px;" class="thumbcaption">Female (left) and male (right) cones are the sex organs of pines and other conifers.</div></div>

Many plants have [[flower]]s and these are the sexual organs of those plants. Flowers are usually hermaphroditic, producing both male and female gametes. The female parts, in the center of a flower, are the [[carpel]]s<U+2014>one or more of these may be merged to form a single [[pistil]]. Within carpels are ovules which develop into seeds after fertilization. The male parts of the flower are the [[stamen]]s: these long filamentous organs are arranged between the pistil and the petals and produce pollen at their tips. When a pollen grain lands upon the top of a carpel, the tissues of the plant react to transport the grain down into the carpel to merge with an ovule, eventually forming seeds.

In [[pine]]s and other [[conifer]]s the sex organs are [[conifer cone]]s and have male and female forms. The more familiar female cones are typically more durable, containing ovules within them. Male cones are smaller and produce pollen which is transported by wind to land in female cones. As with flowers, seeds form within the female cone after pollination.

Because plants are immobile, they depend upon passive methods for transporting pollen grains to other plants. Many plants, including conifers and grasses, produce lightweight pollen which is carried by wind to neighboring plants. Other plants have heavier, sticky pollen that is specialized for transportation by [[insect]]s. The plants attract these insects with nectar-containing flowers. Insects transport the pollen as they move to other flowers, which also contain female reproductive organs, resulting in [[pollination]].
[[Image:Shiitake mushroom.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Mushrooms are produced as part of fungal sexual reproduction.]]

===Fungi===
{{main|Mating in fungi}}
Most fungi reproduce sexually, having both a haploid and diploid stage in their life cycles. These fungi are typically [[isogamy|isogamous]], lacking male and female specialization: haploid fungi grow into contact with each other and then fuse their cells. In some of these cases the fusion is asymmetric, and the cell which donates only a nucleus (and not accompanying cellular material) could arguably be considered "male".<ref>{{cite book| author=Nick Lane| title=Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life| pages=236<U+2013>237| isbn=0192804812| year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

Some fungi, including [[baker's yeast]], have [[mating type]]s that create a duality similar to male and female roles. Yeast with the same mating type will not fuse with each other to form diploid cells, only with yeast carrying the other mating type.<ref>{{cite book| author=Matthew P Scott, Paul Matsudaira, Harvey Lodish, James Darnell, Lawrence Zipursky, Chris A Kaiser, Arnold Berk, Monty Krieger| year=2000| title=Molecular Cell Biology| edition=Fourth| publisher=WH Freeman and Co| isbn=0-7167-4366-3}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mcb.section.3752 14.1. Cell-Type Specification and Mating-Type Conversion in Yeast]</ref>

Fungi produce [[mushroom]]s as part of their sexual reproduction. Within the mushroom diploid cells are formed, later dividing into haploid [[spore]]s<U+2014>the height of the mushroom aids the [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] of these sexually produced offspring.

The alleles a/A and b/B occur at random. The advantageous combination AB arises rapidly with recombination (a), but must arise independently in (b).]]

===Evolution===
{{main|Evolution of sex}}
Sexual reproduction first appeared about a billion years ago, evolved within ancestral single-celled eukaryotes.<ref>{{cite web| title=Book Review for ''Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth''| url=http://jupiterscientific.org/review/life.html | publisher=Jupiter Scientific| accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> The reason for the initial evolution of sex, and the reason it has survived to the present, are still matters of debate. Some of the many plausible theories include: that sex creates variation among offspring, sex helps in the spread of advantageous traits, and that sex helps in the removal of disadvantageous traits.

Sexual reproduction is a process specific to [[eukaryote]]s, organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and mitochondria. In addition to animals, plants, and fungi, [[protist|other eukaryotes]] (eg. the [[malaria]] parasite) also engage in sexual reproduction. Some bacteria use [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] to transfer genetic material between bacteria; while not the same as sexual reproduction, this also results in the mixture of genetic traits.

What is considered defining of sexual reproduction is the difference between the gametes and the binary nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete types within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, no third gamete is known in multicellular animals.<ref>

This article is intended to focus on the biological aspects of sex.  If you are interested in articles specifically related to humans and sexuality please see the above links.

==Sex determination==
{{main|Sex-determination system}}
The most basic sexual system is one in which all organisms are [[hermaphrodite]]s, producing both male and female gametes<U+2014>this is true of some animals (eg. snails) and the majority of flowering plants.<ref name=dellaporta_1993/> In many cases, however, specialization of sex has evolved such that some organisms produce only male or only female gametes. The biological cause for an organism developing into one sex or the other is called [[sex determination]].

In the majority of species with sex specialization organisms are either [[male]] (producing only male gametes) or [[female]] (producing only female gametes). A few exceptions exist<U+2014>for example, in the roundworm ''[[C. elegans]]'' the two sexes are hermaphrodite and male (a system called [[androdioecy]]).

Sometimes an organism's development is intermediate between male and female, a condition called [[intersex]]. Sometimes intersex individuals are called "hermaphrodite" but, unlike biological hermaphrodites, intersex individuals are unusual cases and are not typically fertile in both male and female aspects.

===Genetic===
[[Image:Drosophila XY sex-determination.svg|thumb|200px|right|Like humans and other mammals, the common fruit fly has an XY sex determination system.]]
In genetic [[sex determination]] systems, an organism's sex is determined by the genome it inherits. Genetic sex determination usually depends on asymmetrically inherited sex chromosomes which carry genetic features that influence [[developmental biology|development]]; sex may be determined either by the presence of a sex chromosome or by how many the organism has. Genetic sex determination, because it is determined by chromosome assortment, usually results in a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring.

[[Human]]s and other [[mammal]]s have an [[XY sex determination]] system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for triggering male development. The default sex, in the absence of a Y chromosome, is female. Thus, XX mammals are female and XY are male. XY sex determination is found in other organisms, including the [[common fruit fly]] and some plants.<ref name=dellaporta_1993>{{cite journal| title=Sex Determination in Flowering Plants| author=Dellaporta SL, Calderon-Urrea A| journal=The Plant Cell| volume=5| year=1993| pages=1241<U+2013>1251 | doi = 10.2307/3869777}}</ref> In some cases, including in the fruit fly, it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome.

In [[bird]]s, which have a [[ZW sex-determination system]], the opposite is true: the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male.<ref>{{cite journal| title=DMRT1 Is Upregulated in the Gonads During Female-to-Male Sex Reversal in ZW Chicken Embryos| author=Smith CA, Katza M, Sinclair AH| journal=Biology of Reproduction| year=2003| volume=68| pages=560<U+2013>570| doi=10.1095/biolreprod.102.007294| pmid=12533420}}</ref> In this case ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. In both XY and ZW sex determination systems the sex chromosome carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller, carrying little more than the genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/biology/textbook/gender/gender_4.html| title=Evolution of the Y Chromosome| publisher=Annenberg Media| accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>

Many [[insect]]s use a sex determination system based on the number of sex chromosomes. This is called [[XO sex-determination system|XX/XO sex determination]]<U+2014>the O indicates the absence of the sex chromosome. All other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. In [[field cricket]]s, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Karyotypes of two American field crickets: Gryllus rubens and Gryllus sp. (Orthoptera: Gryllidae)| author=Yoshimura A| journal=Entomological Science| volume=8| issue=3| pages=219<U+2013>222| year=2005 | doi = 10.1111/j.1479-8298.2005.00118.x}}</ref> In the nematode ''[[C. elegans]]'' most worms are self-fertilizing XX hermaphrodites, but occasionally abnormalities in chromosome inheritance regularly give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome<U+2014>these XO individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).<ref>{{cite book| title=''C. Elegans'' II| author=Riddle DL, Blumenthal T, Meyer BJ, Priess JR| publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press| year=1997| isbn=0-87969-532-3}}[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=ce2.section.312 9.II. Sexual Dimorphism]</ref>

Other insects, including [[honey bee]]s and [[ant]]s, use a [[haplodiploid sex-determination system]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sex Determination in the Honeybee| author=Charlesworth B| journal=Cell| volume=114| issue=4| year=2003| pages=397<U+2013>398 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00610-X}}</ref> In this case diploid individuals are generally female, and haploid individuals (which develop from unfertilized eggs) are male. This sex-determination system results in highly biased [[sex ratio]]s, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.

[[Image:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Clownfish]] are initially male; the largest fish in a group becomes female.]]

===Nongenetic===
For many species sex is not determined by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life. Many [[reptile]]s have [[temperature-dependent sex determination]]: the temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism. In some [[turtle]]s, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2<U+00B0>C.

Many [[fish]] change sex over the course of their lifespan, a phenomenon called [[sequential hermaphroditism]]. In [[clownfish]], smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female. In many [[wrasse]]s the opposite is true<U+2014>most fish are initially female and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.

In some [[fern]]s the default sex is hermaphrodite, but ferns which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by residual hormones to instead develop as male.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sex-Determining Mechanisms in Land Plants| author=Tanurdzic M and Banks JA| journal=The Plant Cell| year=2004| volume=16| pages=S61<U+2013>S71|doi=10.1105/tpc.016667|pmid=15084718}}</ref>
{{-}}

==Sexual dimorphism==
[[Image:Male and female pheasant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|[[Common pheasant]]s are sexually dimorphic in both size and appearance.]]
{{main|sexual dimorphism}}
Many animals have differences between the male and female sexes in size and appearance, a phenomenon called [[sexual dimorphism]]. Sexual dimorphisms are often associated with [[sexual selection]] - the competition between individuals of one sex to mate with the opposite sex.<ref>{{cite book| author=Darwin C| year=1871| title=[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]| publisher=Murray, London}}</ref> Antlers in male deer, for example, are used in combat between males to win reproductive access to female deer. In many cases the male of a species is larger in size; in mammals species with high sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly [[Polygyny|polygynous]] mating systems<U+2014>presumably due to selection for success in [[intraspecific competition|competition]] with other males.

Other animals, including most insects and many fish, have larger females. This may be associated with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm<U+2014>larger females are able to produce more eggs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is fecundity the ultimate cause of female-biased size dimorphism in a dragon lizard?| author=Stuart-Smith J, Swain R, Stuart-Smith R, Wapstra E| journal=Journal of Zoology| volume=273| issue=3| year=2007| pages=266<U+2013>272 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00324.x}}</ref> Occasionally this dimorphism is extreme, with males reduced to living as [[parasite]]s dependent on the female.

In birds, males often have a more [[animal colouration|colourful]] appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) that would seem to put the organism at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would seem to make a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation for this is the [[handicap principle]].<ref>[[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi, A.]] and Zahavi, A. (1997) ''The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle''. Oxford University Press. Oxford. ISBN 0-19-510035-2</ref> This hypothesis says that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his [[genetic fitness]] to females<U+2014>traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.

[[Sex differences in humans]] include, generally, a larger size and more body hair in men; women have breasts, wider hips, and a higher body fat percentage.
