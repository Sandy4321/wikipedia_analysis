: ''Also see: [[B-flat minor]], or [[B major]].'' <!--hat note-->

'''B{{music|flat}} major''' or '''B-flat major''' is a [[major scale]] based on B-flat, consisting of the pitches [[B<U+266D> (musical note)|B{{music|flat}}]], [[C (musical note)|C]], [[D (musical note)|D]], [[E<U+266D> (musical note)|E{{music|flat}}]], [[F (musical note)|F]], [[G (musical note)|G]], and [[A (musical note)|A]]. Its [[key signature]] has two flats, B/E (''see below:'' [[#Scales and keys|Scales and keys]]). 

Its [[relative key|relative minor]] is [[G minor]], and its [[parallel key|parallel minor]] is [[B-flat minor|B{{music|flat}} minor]].

__TOC__<!--forced Table of Contents-->
B-flat major is a suitable key for most [[wind instrument]]s, especially those for which it is their home key, such as [[clarinet]]s, [[trumpet]]s, Tenor saxophone, Soprano saxophone and the [[flute]]s in B-flat.

[[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 98 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 98]] is credited as the first symphony he (or anyone else) wrote in that key in which he included [[trumpet]] and [[timpani]] parts. Actually, his brother [[Michael Haydn]] had written one such symphony earlier, [[Symphony No. 36 (Michael Haydn)|No. 36]]. Though Joseph still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an [[F major]] key signature (instead of transposing with a [[C major]] key signature), a procedure that made sense since he limited that instrument to the tonic and dominant pitches.<ref>H. C. Robbins Landon, ''Haydn Symphonies'' London: British Broadcasting Corporation (1966): 57</ref> Many editions of the work, however, use no key signature and specify the instrument as "Timpani in B flat - F."

Five of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Mozart Piano Concertos|piano concerti]] are in B-flat major.
