'''Philip David Ochs''' ([[December 19]] [[1940]]<U+2013>[[April 9]] [[1976]]) was a  [[United States|U.S.]] [[protest song|protest singer]] (or, as he preferred, a "[[topical song|topical singer]]"), songwriter, musician and recording artist who was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, earnest humanism, political activism, insightful and alliterative lyrics, and haunting voice. He wrote hundreds of songs in the 1960s and released eight LP record albums in his lifetime.

He performed at many political events, including [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] and [[American civil rights movement|civil rights]] rallies, student events, and organized labor events over the course of his career, in addition to many concert appearances at such venues as New York City's [[The Town Hall]] and [[Carnegie Hall]].   Politically, Ochs described himself as a "left social democrat"  who turned into an "early revolutionary" after the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, which had a profound effect on his state of mind.<ref>Schumacher (1996), p. 201</ref>  He was often seen as a radical and also a patriot <U+2014> though he was also interested in differing political philosophies as well as journalism, and was an avid fan of music and movies.  

After years of prolific writing in the 1960s, Ochs' mental stability declined in the 1970s and eventually he succumbed to a number of problems including [[bipolar disorder]], [[clinical depression|depression]], and [[alcoholism]], and he took his own life in 1976.    

Some of his major influences were [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]], [[Faron Young]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[John Wayne]], and [[John F. Kennedy]].  His best known songs include "Power and the Glory", "Draft Dodger Rag", "There But for Fortune", "Changes", "Crucifixion, "When I'm Gone", "Love Me I'm a Liberal", "Links on the Chain", "Ringing of Revolution", "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", and "I Ain't Marching Anymore".

==Early years==

Born in [[El Paso, Texas]] in 1940, Phil Ochs' family moved around frequently. He was raised in [[Far Rockaway]], New York, then Perrysburg in upstate New York, where he first studied music <U+2014> clarinet<ref>Schumacher (1996), pp. 23<U+2013>4</ref> <U+2014>  and then his family moved to [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He grew up in a non-political and non-religious Jewish middle-class family. His father, Jacob ("Jack") Ochs, was a doctor; his  mother, Gertrude Phin Ochs, was from Scotland.  His father, who had treated soldiers at the [[Battle of the Bulge]], suffered from [[bipolar disorder|manic depression]]<ref>Schumacher (1996) pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref> and was thus not always available to his children.  

As a teenager, Ochs was recognized as a talented clarinet player, and was praised for having "exceptional musical feeling" and a "gift for interpretation"<ref>Schumacher (1996), p. 24</ref>.  His youthful musical skills allowed him to play clarinet underage with the [[Capital University]] Orchestra in [[Ohio]].  Although Phil originally played classical music, he soon became interested in other sounds on the radio, such as early rock icons [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Elvis Presley]], and he was also interested in country music and listened to [[Faron Young]], [[Ernest Tubb]], [[Hank Williams, Sr.]], and [[Johnny Cash]] avidly.  

Ochs spent a lot of time at the movies too, and he especially liked big screen heroes such as [[John Wayne]] and [[Audie Murphy]], and a little later he developed an interest in movie rebels such as [[Marlon Brando]] and [[James Dean]].   

After graduating from the [[Staunton Military Academy]] in rural [[Virginia]] in 1958, he enrolled in the [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].  Unhappy after his first semester, he took a leave of absence and went to Florida. While in Miami, the 18-year-old Ochs was put in jail for two weeks for sleeping on a park bench, an incident he would later recall: "Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer. My primary thought  was journalism ... so in a flash I decided <U+2014> I'll be a writer and a major in journalism."<ref name="Doggett">Doggett, P. ''All the News That's Fit to Sing'' & ''I Ain't Marching Anymore'' liner notes, Elektra, 2001</ref>  

He returned to Ohio State to study journalism and began to be interested in politics, with a particular interest in the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959<ref>Schumacher, pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref>  This was where he met [[Jim Glover]], a fellow student who was a devotee of folk music and who introduced Ochs to the music of [[Pete Seeger]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and [[The Weavers]]. Glover taught Ochs how to play guitar, and they debated politics.  Ochs began prolifically writing newspaper pieces, often on radical themes.  When the student paper refused to publish some of his more "radical" articles, he started his own underground newspaper called "The Word".  His two main interests, politics and music, soon merged, and Ochs began writing topical political songs.  Ochs and Glover formed a duet at first called "The Singing Socialists" and then "The Sundowners", but they broke up before their first professional gig and Glover went to New York City to be a folksinger.  Phil's parents and younger brother had moved from Columbus to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and Phil started to spend more time there and began performing professionally at a local folk club called Farragher's Back Room, and was the opening act for a number of musicians, including the [[Smothers Brothers]] in the summer of 1961.  Ochs met [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] that summer as well, and according to [[Dave Van Ronk]], Gibson became "the seminal influence"<ref>Schumacher p.43</ref> on Ochs' writing.  Ochs continued at Ohio State into his senior year, but was bitterly disappointed at not being appointed Editor-in-Chief of the college newspaper, and dropped out in his last semester without graduating.<ref>Information about Ochs' college years from Schumacher (1996) pp. 30<U+2013>45.</ref>

==Early career==
In 1962 Phil moved to [[New York City]] and began playing numerous small folk clubs, and eventually became an integral part of the [[Greenwich Village]] [[folk music]] scene. He emerged as an unpolished yet passionate vocalist who wrote poignant lyrics about [[war]], [[civil rights]], [[labour movement|labor struggles]] and other topics which continue to be relevant to this day, and could perhaps be described as a socially conscious [[Patriotism|patriot]] in the tradition of [[Woody Guthrie]]. He described himself as a "singing journalist",  or "troubadour journalist", saying he built his songs from stories he read in ''[[Newsweek]]''.   By the summer of 1963 he was well known enough in folk circles to be invited to sing at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] where he performed "Too Many Martyrs" (co-written with [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] ), "Talking Birmingham Jam" and "Power and the Glory", his rousing patriotic, but not uncritical, [[Woody Guthrie]]-esque anthem that brought the audience to its feet;  also appearing at Newport '63 were [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Paxton]].  Ochs' return appearance at Newport in 1964 was widely praised, with "Draft Dodger Rag" and other songs.  But he was not invited to appear in 1965, the festival when Dylan famously <U+2014> or infamously <U+2014> rocked out "Maggie's Farm" with an electric guitar.  Although many in the folk world decried Dylan's choice, Ochs was amused, and admired his courage in defying the folk establishment.<ref>Newport Folk Festival details from Mark Kemp, "Song of a Soldier: The Life and Times of Phil Ochs", ''[[Farewells & Fantasies]]'' liner notes, 1997</ref> 

Ochs contributed many songs and articles for ''[[Broadside Magazine]]'', and it was at ''Broadside'' he had his first chance to record. His first three albums (''[[All the News That's Fit to Sing]]'' (1964), ''[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]'' (1965), and ''[[Phil Ochs in Concert]]'' (1966)), all on [[Elektra Records]], contain some of his best work as a pure folk singer and examples of two traditional genres that Ochs contributed to in his early performances, namely the [[talking blues]] (such as "Talking Vietnam Blues") and the musical reinterpretation of older poetry (as of [[Alfred Noyes]]'s "[[The Highwayman]]" and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Bells]]").<ref>Schumacher (1996), pp. 108-109.</ref> During this early period of his career, his friend [[Bob Dylan]] said, "I just can't keep up with Phil. And he's getting better and better and better."<ref>A Letter From Bob Dylan (Broadside Magazine, January 1964).  Link:  http://www.slopbucket.com/bob/tbob/writtenword/letter.html </ref>
This praise and friendly rivalry was to change in 1965, and on one occasion Ochs' criticism of one of Dylan's songs led Dylan to throw him out of his limousine, proclaiming: "You're not a folksinger. You're a journalist".<ref>Schumacher (1996), p. 106</ref> 

His managers in the early part of his career were Albert Grossman (manager of Dylan and [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]]) followed by [[Arthur Gorson]]. Gorson had close ties with such groups as [[Americans For Democratic Action]], the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], and [[Students for a Democratic Society]].<ref>Eliot (1989) pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> 

Generally a quixotic and high-strung type of person, Phil would often have drastic mood swings, one way and then the next.  He was known to enjoy himself, fraternize, joke, drink, and debate extensively with others.  Through much of the 1960s Phil seemed to be in a manic creative mood, and he kept advancing his musical art form with each subsequent album release.

==Middle career==
In 1967, Ochs <U+2014> now managed by his brother Michael <U+2014> left Elektra for [[A&M Records]] and moved to California, trying a different musical approach and enhancing his solo acoustic guitar performance style with richer orchestration. In his later studio albums (''[[Pleasures of the Harbor]]'' (1967), ''[[Tape from California]]'' (1968), ''[[Rehearsals for Retirement]]'' (1969), and the ironically titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1970), which actually contains all original material and no reissued recordings) he moved away from simply-produced topical songs and experimented with ensemble and even orchestral instrumentation, "baroque-folk", in the hopes of producing a [[pop music|pop]]-folk hybrid that would be a [[Billboard Hot 100|hit]].  

[[Robert Christgau]], writing of ''Pleasures of the Harbor'' in May 1968, did not consider this a good turn. While describing Ochs as "unquestionably a nice guy<U+2026>impossible to dislike" as a person, he then went on to say "Too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave<U+2026> [and that] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed. Very bad indeed that he has learned so little from [[Mao Tse-tung]]'s poetry<U+2026>". (Eight of Mao's poems had appeared on the record jacket of ''In Concert'', with the tagline "Is this the enemy?".) "''Pleasures of the Harbor''", continued Christgau, "<U+2026>epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since ''[[Sgt. Pepper]]''. <U+2026>[The] gaudy musical settings <U+2026> inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum<U+2026>"<ref>Robert Christgau, Column, ''Esquire'', May 1968, [http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-aow/column3.php reproduced online] on Christgau's site, accessed [[7 August]] [[2006]].</ref>  Always quick with ironic humor, Ochs includes Christgau's comment (unattributed) about his so-called webbed-hand guitar playing in the 1968 songbook ''The War is Over'' on a page called "The Critics Raved", opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a New York City street garbage can.<ref>Phil Ochs, ''The War is Over'' (1968), p. 44</ref>  Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped for.

Although he was trying new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots lyrically or personally <U+2014> among others, his "White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land" and "The War is Over" include powerful anti-war lyrics ("Raw recruits are lining up like coffins in a cage"<ref>"White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land" on ''Tape from California'', 1968</ref> and "But just before the end, even treason might be worth a try <U+2014> this country is too young to die"<ref>"The War is Over" on ''Tape from California'', 1968</ref>).   Other representative tunes from these albums are "Outside of a Small Circle of Friends", about public, political, and personal apathy, a song in which Ochs used the powerful example of the murder of [[Kitty Genovese]], who was killed despite having her cries for help heard by others, to demonstrate the ambivalent nature of society; "Crucifixion," where he compares the deaths of [[Christ]] and [[JFK]] as part of an inevitable "cycle of sacrifice" in which the world builds up heroes and turns around to celebrate their destruction;  "Chords of Fame," warning against the dangers and corruptions of fame; "Pleasures of the Harbor," a lyrical portrait of the lonely sailor seeking human connection far from home;   "Jim Dean of Indiana," an homage to a small town boy who left to be a movie star, but ended up buried in his small town; and the sad and beautiful "William Butler Yeats<ref>"Yeats" was Ochs' reference to himself; he later took the name "Butler" as part of his alter ego, John Butler Train.</ref>  Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed", about the despair felt in the aftermath of the Chicago [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] police riot.  None actually became hits, although "Small Circle of Friends" received airplay and reached #118 on the [[Billboard]] charts before being banned from many radio stations for suggesting (perhaps sarcastically) that "smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] is more fun than drinking [[beer]]".  It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40.  ([[Joan Baez]], however, did have a hit in 1965 with her cover of Ochs' song "There But for Fortune", which was also nominated for a [[Grammy]] award for "Best Folk Recording".)

A lifelong movie fan, Ochs worked the narratives of justice and rebellion that he saw in films as a young man into his music, describing some of his songs as "cinematic" (e.g., in the live spoken intro to "Ringing of Revolution"  from ''[[Phil Ochs in Concert]]''). He was disappointed, and bitter, when his onetime hero [[John Wayne]] embraced the [[Vietnam War]] with what Ochs saw as the blind patriotism of ''[[The Green Berets (movie)|The Green Berets]]''.
:...here we have John Wayne, who was a major artistic and psychological figure on the American scene... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain ... sense of honor [about] what the soldier was doing... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of what it meant to be a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty...  Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost technically-robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' with ''The Green Berets''. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.<ref>From an interview by Sis Cunningham and Gorden Friesen, editors of ''Broadside'', "Interview with Phil Ochs", ''Broadside'' #91; quoted in Schumacher (1996) p. 178.</ref>

Phil Ochs is perhaps best known as a political activist. He was profoundly concerned with the escalation of the [[Vietnam War]]. He performed tirelessly at anti-war rallies all around the country and actively supported [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s bid for the 1968 Democratic nomination for President. He organized several "The War is Over" rallies ("...Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and thousands of other Americans have done <U+2014> declare the war over."<ref>Phil Ochs, "Have You Heard? The War is Over!", ''Village Voice'', November 23, 1967; a longer excerpt of Ochs' ''Voice'' piece is in Schumacher (1996), p. 171; the full text is in Ochs' 1968 ''The War is Over'' songbook, p. 92</ref>).    

Phil was involved in the creation of the [[Youth International Party]],<ref>Eliot (1989), p. 177</ref>  known as the "[[Yippie]]s", standing alongside '60s radicals [[Jerry Rubin]], [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Paul Krassner]], although not always in agreement<ref> See, for example, Schumacher (1996), pp. 169, 183<U+2013>4; Mark Kemp, "Song of a Soldier: The Life and Times of Phil Ochs", ''[[Farewells & Fantasies]]'' liner notes, 1997, p.  48</ref> with the Yippie point of view or their tactics.<ref>Despite their disagreements, the Yippies used several Ochs songs in their media, in particular Ochs' "signature song" (so-called by Ben Edmonds, "Track by Track", ''[[Farewells & Fantasies]]'' liner notes, 1997, p. 74 and  Schumacher (1996), p. 91) the anti-war "I Ain't Marching Anymore". For example, see [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/videodir/pacificaviet/yippie.ram this Yippie-produced documentary]</ref>. But he was part of the planning of the Yippies' "Festival of Life" which was to take place at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] along with demonstrations by other anti-war groups including the National Mobilization Against the War in Vietnam. Despite warnings that there might be trouble, Ochs went to Chicago as  both a guest of the McCarthy campaign, and to participate in the demonstrations. He performed in Lincoln Park, Grant Park and at the Chicago Coliseum, witnessed the violence perpetrated by the Chicago police  against the protestors, and was himself arrested at one point.<ref>Ochs comments on the events during a Vancouver concert, recorded on [[There and Now: Live in Vancouver 1968]], which includes his song "Where were you in Chicago?".</ref>  

The events of [[1968]] <U+2014> the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]], the violent police riot in Chicago, and the eventual election of Richard Nixon  <U+2014> left Ochs disillusioned and depressed.  The cover of his 1969 ''[[Rehearsals for Retirement]]'' album eerily portrays a tombstone with the words
<div align="center">
PHIL OCHS <br />
(AMERICAN) <br />
BORN: EL PASO, TEXAS, 1940<br />
DIED: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 1968<br />  <!--don't change this, Chicago 1968 is correct, it is not his literal death, it is a reference to the events surrounding the 1968 Democratic Convention-->
</div>

Ochs testified for the defense at the infamous trial of the [[Chicago Seven|Chicago 7]] in December 1969 along with other anti-war activists.  His testimony included his recitation of the lyrics to "I Ain't Marching Anymore", followed by his singing it to the press corps outside of the courtroom: the singing was aired  by [[Walter Cronkite]] on the CBS Evening News, to Phil's amusement.<ref>Eliot (1979), pp. 187<U+2013>190</ref>

==Late career==
But after the trial he changed direction, deciding that he needed to get back to his musical roots in order to try to have more influence on the general public, the "regular" folks, the working class, the middle class, and to speak directly to the people.  He thought he needed to be "part Elvis Presley, part Che Guevara".  He commissioned a gold lam<U+00E9> suit from one of Elvis' costumers that he would wear for the cover photograph on  ''[[Greatest Hits (Phil Ochs)|Greatest Hits]]'' and he went on tour <U+2014> most famously in [[Carnegie Hall]] in March 1970 <U+2014> wearing that suit, singing medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard, as well as some new songs from ''Greatest Hits'' and new interpretations of his old songs.  The Carnegie Hall shows (immortalized in the ''Gunfight at Carnegie Hall'' album) were met with hostility from some of the people in the crowd, but with wild appreciation from many others. The first show of the night was cut short by a bomb threat; the second, midnight, show  went on until 3AM, with loyal fans cheering to the end.<ref>Schumacher (1996) pp. 227<U+2013>233</ref>

During the time of the "gold suit" concerts, Phil was taking several pills to get through sometimes rocky performances.  He had been taking [[Valium]] for years to help control his nerves by this point, and was also drinking heavily. At points, he was even prescribed [[Lithium]] for his growing mental problems, though he didn't enjoy taking it.  The [[downers]] would sometimes pull him down too far to perform the way he wanted, so he tried to take [[uppers]] to counter their effects, with often devastating results.  Pianist Lincoln Mayorga recalls this time, "He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour.  The wine was pulling him one way and the [[uppers]] were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess.  There were so many pharmaceuticals around <U+2014> so many pills.  I'd never seen anything like that".<ref>Lincoln Mayorga quote found on pg. 51 of Mark Kemp's liner notes of the "[[Farewells & Fantasies]]" 3 CD set, 1997</ref>  Phil eventually decided to attempt to cut back on pills, but alcohol was still primarily his drug of choice throughout much of the rest of his life.    

Ochs would not record any further albums, partly depressed by his lack of widespread appreciation and compounded by feelings of disillusionment, he slipped deeper into manic-depression, alcoholism and idleness, but he still tried to continue his political activism in a number of ways whenever he could.

==International travels==
He began to travel the world, and met and sang with [[Chile]]an folksinger [[V<U+00ED>ctor Jara]], a supporter of Chilean President [[Salvador Allende]]--a [[Marxist]] who had been democratically elected in the [[1970 Chilean presidential election]]<U+2014>-both of whom later died during the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], Jara after being publicly tortured, Allende under unclear circumstances.

In October 1970, he performed with Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, and the Canadian band Chilliwack at the first [[Greenpeace]] Benefit Concert, organized to raise funds to send a ship to protest a planned underground hydrogen bomb test by the US at the Aleutian island of Amchitka. Ochs was personally invited by [[John Lennon]] to sing at a large benefit in December of 1971 on behalf of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]], an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given an overly severe sentence; Ochs performed  at the "Free John Sinclair" benefit along with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], and many others;  the rally culminated in Lennon making his first post-Beatle-breakup live onstage appearance<ref>Schumacher (1996), p.258)</ref> with [[Yoko Ono]].  

This was not a prolific songwriting time for Ochs, but he still had his genius: for example re-working his old sarcastic song "Here's To The State Of [[Mississippi]]" as "Here's To The State of [[Richard Nixon]]" with cutting lines such as "and the speeches of the President are the ravings of a clown"--later improved by Ochs to "and the speeches of the Spiro are the ravings of a clown", referring to Nixon's vitriolic Vice President, [[Spiro Agnew]].<ref>The "Spiro" lyrics were performed in concert by Ochs many times; see, for example, [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1jvBBIDzLg this clip] from the 1971 "Free John Sinclair" rally.</ref>  Despite his disillusionment with the political process as a result of the 1968 election, Ochs continued to work for the election campaigns of antiwar candidates, such as [[George McGovern]]'s  profoundly unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1972 and he continued to record and perform sporadically.

While visiting Africa in 1973, Ochs was attacked and strangled by robbers, which damaged his vocal cords.  The attack exacerbated his growing mental problems, and  at times  he became increasingly paranoid.  He believed the attack may have been arranged by government agents (he was convinced that the FBI had extensive files on him), but he continued his trip, and recorded a "single" in Africa.  

Angry and upset on his return from Africa at the deaths of Allende and Jara during the Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat,  in May 1974 Ochs organized a major benefit concert, "An Evening with Salvador Allende,"  at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] Felt Forum which included films of the late Allende, and singers and political activists such as [[Pete Seeger]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], [[Ramsey Clark]], and [[Bob Dylan]], who agreed at the last minute to appear when he heard that the concert had sold so few tickets that it was in danger of being cancelled. Once Dylan's participation was announced, the event quickly sold out. 

This led to a reconciliation between Dylan and Ochs, who discussed touring together. That never came about, but the idea eventually evolved into Dylan's Rolling Thunder Review. 

The [[Vietnam War]] officially ended in April 1975: in what would be his last activist event, Phil Ochs led a final "War is Over" rally in New York's Central Park, which brought together over 100,000 people to hear [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], [[Pete Seeger]] and others.  Ochs and [[Joan Baez]] sang a duet of his "There But for Fortune" and he closed with a finally true rendition of his song "The War is Over".

==Decline and death==
Intensely disappointed by his lack of commercial success and unable to write new songs, Ochs was also haunted by [[bipolar disorder]] and an [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] under the drunken, chaotic persona John Butler Train.  After spiralling downward in a long stretch of erratic, self-destructive behavior, Phil Ochs [[suicide|hanged himself]] on [[April 9]], [[1976]] at his sister's home in [[Far Rockaway]], New York.  

Many years after his death, it was revealed that the [[FBI]] had a 449-page file on Ochs.<ref>Ochs' main FBI file totals 449 pages, of which 429 pages were released. See ''[http://www.lulu.com/content/1184058 Folk Singer for the FBI: The Phil Ochs FBI File]''</ref>  Most of the information in those files seems to be regarding his association with counter-culture figures, protest organizers, musicians, and other so-called "subversive" types.  The FBI often didn't do such a diligent job of collecting information on him though, they frequently misspelled his name as "Phil Oakes" in their files, and continued collecting information on him after his death, until somehow, months later, they heard that he had passed on.<ref>Eliot (1989), pages 301<U+2013>308</ref>     

Congresswoman [[Bella Abzug]] (D-NY), an outspoken antiwar activist herself who had appeared at the final "War is Over" rally just a year before, entered this statement into the ''Congressional Record'' on [[April 29]], [[1976]]: 

{{quote|Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, a young folksinger whose music personified the protest mood of the 1960s took his own life.  Phil Ochs<U+2014>whose original compositions were compelling moral statements against war in Southeast Asia<U+2014>apparently felt that he had run out of words.''

While his tragic action was undoubtedly motivated by terrible personal despair, his death is a political as well as an artistic tragedy.  I believe it is indicative of the despair many of the activists of the 1960s are experiencing as they perceive a government which continues the distortion of national priorities that is exemplified in the military budget we have before us.''

Phil Ochs' poetic pronouncements were part of a larger effort to galvanize his generation into taking action to prevent war, racism, and poverty.  He left us a legacy of important songs that continue to be relevant in 1976 <U+2014> even though "the war is over".''

Just one year ago<U+2014>during this week of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War<U+2014>Phil recruited entertainers to appear at the "War is Over" celebration in Central Park, at which I spoke.''

It seems particularly appropriate that this week we should commemorate the contributions of this extraordinary young man.<ref>Bella Abzug, ''Congressional Record'', vol. 122, pt 10, April 29, 1976, quoted in Schumacher (1996), pp. 354<U+2013>55.</ref>}}

Writing in the ''[[Village Voice]]'' ten days after Ochs died <U+2014> far too late for Ochs to appreciate the irony or benefit from belated praise <U+2014> the same critic [[Robert Christgau]] who had been so critical of the ''[[Pleasures of the Harbor]]'' album eight years earlier wrote: "... I came around to liking Phil Ochs's music, guitar included. My affection [for Ochs] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [noting] that many observers who care more for folk music than I do remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor as close to the peak of the genre."<ref>{{cite news | date = [[1976-04-19]] | title = Phil Ochs 1940-1976 | format = ''Voice'' column reproduced on author<U+2019>s website | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/ochs-76.php | authorlink = Robert Christgau | first = Robert | last = Christgau | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | work = [[Village Voice]] }}</ref>
