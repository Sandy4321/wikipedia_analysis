'''Major League Soccer''' ('''MLS''') is a professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] league sanctioned by [[FIFA]] as the top flight of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]]. The league is comprised of 13 teams in the United States and one in Canada. The league will expand to 15 teams in 2009 with the addition of a franchise in [[Seattle MLS|Seattle]] and anticipates having a complement of 16 teams by 2010 or 2011.

The current champions of MLS are the [[Houston Dynamo]].

==Competition format==

The full schedule for the [[2008 Major League Soccer season]] is expected to be announced by February 2008. Dates for several showcase competitions are already in place.

Basics of the [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007 season]], which ended in November: 
*The season ran from [[April 7]] to [[November 18]], when the [[2007 MLS Cup]] took place at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The 13 teams were split into two conferences: the Western Conference with six teams, the Eastern Conference with seven, including the league's newest addition, [[Toronto FC]]. 

*Each team played 30 games, evenly divided between home and away matches. Each team played every other team twice, home and away, for a total of 24 games. The remaining 6 games were intra-conference, with each club playing its fellow conference members. In the Western Conference, an additional game was added to highlight geographic rivalries (Los Angeles vs. Chivas USA, Houston vs. Dallas, Salt Lake vs. Colorado).

*With its win at the [[MLS Cup]], the Houston Dynamo qualified for the next [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]]. [[DC United]], by virtue of its top regular-season record [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] and also qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions' Cup. 

*[[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], an MLS-[[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico]] competition, also debuted on the 2007 season schedule, with most matches occurring midweek in July and August. [[FC Dallas]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], [[DC United]] and [[Houston Dynamo]] played at the 2007 tournament, with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy|Galaxy]] making the final but losing to [[CF Pachuca]] on penalty kicks.

==History==
{{MLS Labelled Map}}
MLS was formed on [[December 17]], [[1993]], fulfilling a promise to [[FIFA]] from [[Alan Rothenberg]] and the US Soccer Federation to establish a "Division One" professional soccer league in exchange for staging the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. The league began play in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] with 10 teams, and enjoyed promising attendance numbers in its first season. Numbers declined slightly after the first year (though they have begun to grow in recent seasons).

The original 10 teams were divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference ([[Columbus Crew]], [[D.C. United]], [[New England Revolution]], [[Red Bull New York|NY/NJ MetroStars]], and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]]) and the Western Conference ([[Colorado Rapids]], [[FC Dallas|Dallas Burn]], [[Kansas City Wizards|Kansas City Wiz]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]]).

===Early years===
The league was greeted with indifference by the American mainstream as the 1994 World Cup in the United States faded from memory. The early years gave rise to the [[Bruce Arena]]-led dynasty of DC United, a championship team in three of the league's first four seasons. It took the expansion [[Chicago Fire (soccer)|Chicago Fire]] in 1998 to end United's stranglehold on the MLS Cup. The championship game featured several players who went on to have a broader impact on MLS and American soccer.

After its first season, MLS suffered from a decline in attendance. The league's quality of play was cast into doubt when the [[United States men's national soccer team]], largely made up of American MLS players, was eliminated during the first round of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and finished in last place among the 32 participating countries. However, some of the 1998 cup players were kept aboard to join up-and-coming players in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. 

The league began to market itself on the talents of American players, both experienced veterans and fresh talents. [[DaMarcus Beasley]] and [[Landon Donovan]] made names for themselves in MLS, while players such as [[Brian McBride]] and [[Clint Mathis]] continued proving their worth to their domestic and national teams.

The league's ongoing financial problems led to the departure of MLS Commissioner [[Doug Logan]] after the end of the 1998 season. In his place was hired [[Don Garber]], a former NFL International chief whose leadership became instrumental to shoring up the league's future. Construction of [[Soccer-specific_stadium|"soccer-specific" stadiums]] for the league's teams -- largely funded by financiers such as [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]] -- became a point of emphasis to bring fiscal health and ensure the league's survival. Hunt's [[Columbus Crew Stadium]], built in 1999, is often cited as a league model.

On the field, the early wave of international players who had joined MLS at its inception drifted into retirement or moved on to teams elsewhere in the world. The run-up to the [[2002 World Cup]] saw a gradual shift in league philosophy toward the development of American talent, a move that would eventually reap success for American soccer. One such player was young [[Landon Donovan]], who was loaned from the German club [[Bayer Leverkusen]] to the [[San Jose Earthquakes]]. He made an immediate impact with the team, scoring a goal in the 2001 MLS Cup to force overtime in their championship win over the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].

===Resurgence===
The 2002 World Cup in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], in which the United States unexpectedly made the quarterfinal round based on wins against [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]], saw a resurgence in American soccer and in MLS. The 2002 MLS Cup, held four months after the World Cup final, set the championship attendance record with a sellout crowd at [[Gillette Stadium]] that saw the Los Angeles Galaxy win their first title. From 2001, both Los Angeles and the San Jose Earthquakes would hoist the trophy twice, while DC United returned to prominence in the 2004 MLS Cup, in the aftermath of an exciting Eastern Conference Championship against the [[New England Revolution]].

MLS drew international attention in 2004 with the DC United debut of 14-year-old [[Freddy Adu]], who entered the league with much fanfare and was heralded as one of the top prospects in U.S. history.

MLS underwent a significant transition in the years leading up to the [[2006 World Cup]] in [[Germany]]. After marketing itself on the talents of American players, the league saw some of its homegrown favorites depart for more prominent leagues in Europe. [[Tim Howard]], goalkeeper for the [[MetroStars]], was sent to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in one of the most lucrative contract deals in league history. DaMarcus Beasley of the Chicago Fire left for [[PSV Eindhoven|the Netherlands]], while Landon Donovan, on loan from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], was recalled back to Germany. Donovan's stint with the team was brief; prior to start of the 2005 season he was traded back to MLS to play with the Los Angeles Galaxy. In 2005 he led the Galaxy to its second MLS Cup.

Many American players, while factoring little in the national team picture, did make an impact in MLS. In 2005, [[Jason Kreis]] of the expansion [[Real Salt Lake]] became the first player in MLS history to score at least 100 career league goals. In Kansas City, goalkeeper [[Bo Oshoniyi]] took the place of injured [[Tony Meola]] and helped the [[Kansas City Wizards|Wizards]] return to MLS Cup in 2004, with the team nearly clinching a playoff berth one season later. [[Herculez Gomez]] made a name for himself playing with the Galaxy in his first three MLS seasons, scoring the game-winning goal in the 2005 [[U.S. Open Cup]] final. In 2005, MLS created its [[MLS Reserve Division|Reserve Division]], with each team's reserve squad playing 12 games, providing valuable playing time to develop non-starters on the team roster. The DC United Reserves in 2005 won the first Reserve Division title.

===2006-present===
The 2006 season confirmed Major League Soccer as a stable product of both American and international soccer. [[Piotr Nowak]], once a Chicago Fire player, managed the All-Star team to a win in the 2006 All-Star Game over [[Chelsea F.C.]], while former-Liverpool player [[Steve Nicol]] led his team to MLS Cup for the third time in five years. [[Bob Bradley]], whose reputation was scarred by disappointing results when coaching the [[MetroStars]], turned around the second-year [[Chivas USA]], who in their inaugural season finished last among all teams in the league. Among players, [[Jaime Moreno]] continued to display his veteran experience, while [[Christian Gomez]] and [[Dwayne De Rosario]] excelled for [[DC United]] and [[Houston Dynamo]], respectively. The Dynamo, who moved from San Jose prior to the season, took the championship in their first season in Houston. The title game featured names familiar to many American soccer fans; [[Taylor Twellman]] scored for the first time in three championship games in overtime, while [[Brian Ching]] scored the equalizer only moments later, sending the game into a penalty kick shootout where goalkeeper [[Pat Onstad]] secured the win for [[Houston Dynamo]].

The 2007 season saw the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]], whose signing has been seen as a coup for American soccer. David Beckham's signing by the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] was made possible by the [[Designated Player Rule]]. He has been followed by four more designated players, including [[Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Blanco]] ([[Club Am<U+00E9>rica]]) to the Chicago Fire, [[Den<U+00ED>lson de Oliveira Ara<U+00FA>jo|Den<U+00ED>lson]] ([[Al-Nasr]], previously [[Real Betis]]) to [[FC Dallas]], and  [[Claudio Reyna]] ([[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]])  and [[Juan Pablo <U+00C1>ngel]] ([[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]) to the [[New York Red Bulls]]. The Red Bulls' use of two designated players has boosted the club tremendously, with both players already improving the team's on-field performance considerably. 

The departure of [[Clint Dempsey]] to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], and New York Red Bulls's debut of former United States captain [[Claudio Reyna]], highlights an exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to the United States. Several other well-known foreign players have followed Beckham and other designated players to MLS for the 2007 season, including [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] (to [[Columbus Crew|Columbus]]), [[Luciano Emilio]] (to [[DC United|D.C.]]), [[Ronald Waterreus]] (to [[New York Red Bulls|New York]]), and [[Abel Xavier]] (to [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]).<ref>{{cite news

Poor starts to the season for the league's once-considered elite teams have contrasted with strong performances by the likes of FC Dallas and the New York Red Bulls. [[Toronto FC]], the league's newest addition, became the last team in the league to earn a point or score a goal in the 2007 season, until sellout crowds at their new BMO Field helped propel them to two straight victories. In the Western Conference, Dallas and the Colorado Rapids have led the way, ahead of a weak field of teams, including both Los Angeles franchises and Real Salt Lake, the last team in the league to notch a win this season. Recently, after poor starts, the defending MLS Cup Champion Houston Dynamo and the Supporters Cup Champion D.C. United have gone on streaks and returned to last season's form, with the Dynamo going on an impressive shutout run of 7 consecutive games where they have not given up a single goal to their opponents, tallying a league record 726 consecutive minutes of scoreless time.

In the inaugural 2007 [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] lost 4-3 on penalty kicks after tying [[CF Pachuca]] with a last minute [[bicycle kick]] by midfielder [[Chris Klein (soccer)|Chris Klein]].  The victory of Pachuca in the $1 million tournament overshadowed the fact that it was the only Mexican team that made it to the second round (3 MLS teams did so-[[Houston Dynamo]], Los Angeles Galaxy, and [[DC United]].  ESPN's Steve Davis has declared the first Superliga a success, saying, "First, SuperLiga has been everything its architects could want. The matches have been spirited and tightly contested, spun with quality and layered with just the right amount of acrimony. So the Houston Dynamo, D.C. United, FC Dallas and the Los Angeles Galaxy may have just finished the most meaningful week of matches ever for MLS teams in the month of July" [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=448831&root=mls&cc=5901].  This follows on news that MLS and [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico]] are considering increasing the size of the tournament from 4 invited teams from each league to eight teams from each league that must fight to qualify for next year's tournament [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmtkc/is_200703/ai_n18773607].

==Organization==
Major League Soccer has been known more for its front office and management dealings than its on-field product. [http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/latest_soccer_news/533352.html] In the off-season, expansion, contraction and rebranding have become buzzwords for the league and its fans. Recently the league has started to focus on improving the quality of play its teams produces on the field via new rules like the [[Designated Player Rule]] and through the creation of a league-wide youth development system.[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_events_news.jsp?ymd=20061110&content_id=78269&vkey=mlscuppr2006&fext=.jsp]  

==="Game First"===
The 2007 MLS offseason is considered by some to be its most productive,[http://sport.monstersandcritics.com/soccer/article_1300505.php/MLS_comes_out_of_the_gates_strong_in_07] and there have been a number of changes for the league, bringing about a slow rise in its standings both financially and athletically. The league announced a youth development initiative,[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_events_news.jsp?ymd=20061110&content_id=78269&vkey=mlscuppr2006&fext=.jsp] which will require youth development teams for all the league's teams, to help the league develop "home-grown" talent on its own. The hope is that by being able to sign up to 2 of its own youth players to the senior team each year that the league's teams will have an incentive to improve the quality and talent pool of the league organically and also benefit from the transfer fees they may bring. Perhaps the first example of a success in "home-grown" talent development is New York Red Bulls' [[Josmer Altidore]], who has risen to prominence as one of the league's most skilled young strikers.  

Furthering the development of the league was the decision to create the [[Designated Player Rule]], which allows for a league team to pay up to two players a salary beyond that covered in the salary cap at their own expense.  Following [[David Beckham]] to MLS are a host of veteran players, including [[Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Blanco]], [[Claudio Reyna]], [[Juan Pablo Angel]], [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]], [[Paulo Wanchope]], [[Abel Xavier]] and [[Den<U+00ED>lson de Oliveira Ara<U+00FA>jo | Den<U+00ED>lson]]. Following the creation of the Designated Player Rule, the league announced in conjunction with the [[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico|La Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n del Futbol Mexicano]] (Mexican First Division) that it would be creating a tournament called [[North American SuperLiga|Superliga]], which would start in 2007, with 4 teams from MLS and 4 from Mexico competing for a [[US$]]1 million prize to become the champions of [[North America]]n club soccer.[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070113&content_id=81815&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp] These matches will initially only be covered in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] by [[Univision]] and [[Telefutura]]. Currently an [[English (language)|English]] language broadcaster has not signed to cover the tournament.  

Following these announcements the league announced "Game-First", a series of initiatives aimed at improving the league in myriad of ways. One of the most immediate changes is the hiring of the first full-time professional referees in league history.[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&content_id=87043&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp]

===Expansion, contraction and relocation===
After starting with ten teams, Major League Soccer added two [[expansion team]]s in the [[Major League Soccer 1998 season|1998 season]], adding the [[Chicago Fire]] and [[Miami Fusion]]. However, following the [[Major League Soccer 2001 season|2001 season]], Miami and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]] were disbanded and the league contracted back to ten teams.

Following the [[Major League Soccer 2004 season|2004 season]] to the present, the league has expanded by four new teams: [[Real Salt Lake]] and [[Chivas USA]] for the [[Major League Soccer 2005 season|2005 season]], the [[Houston Dynamo]] relocating from San Jose for the [[Major League Soccer 2006 season|2006 season]], and [[Toronto FC]] for the [[Major League Soccer 2007 season|2007 season]].  Although the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] relocated to Houston, the Earthquakes<U+2019> name and history were not transferred making the Dynamo an expansion team.  For the [[Major League Soccer 2008 season|2008 season]], the Earthquakes return to the MLS bringing the current total number of clubs to fourteen. The league plans to have two more expansion teams by 2010, and to have a total of eighteen teams by 2012.<ref>[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20071110&content_id=128838&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp MLS to announce expansion to Seattle]</ref>

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reported on its website that Seattle had been awarded a franchise for the [[Major League Soccer 2009 season|2009 season]]<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/09/28/seattle.mls/index.html MLS to Expand to Seattle]</ref>, Don Garber made the official announcement the week of MLS Cup 2007. On [[November 9]], [[2007]], the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' reported that the long standing rumors were confirmed and that Seattle would be receiving an MLS expansion team for the 2009 season <ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soccer/2004004510_webmls09.html Seattle Gets Major League Soccer Franchise]</ref>.  The primary ownership would include [[Seattle Sounders]] owner [[Adrian Hanauer]], [[Seattle Seahawks]] owner [[Paul Allen]], comedian [[Drew Carey]], Hollywood mogul [[Joe Roth]] and fan ownership based on the model created by the legendary [[FC Barcelona]].  The team would play its home games at [[Qwest Field]].  The MLS is currently trying to add another team, as early as 2009, to make the league 16 teams, but if they do not have a plan finalized by [[January 31]], [[2008]], then they will press on with 15 teams for 2009.<ref name="league_goals">[http://www.mlsnet.com//news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20071116&content_id=129731&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp Commissioner outlines league goals]</ref>

At the 2007 State of the League address at the end of the season on 16 November 2007, Commissioner [[Don Garber]] revised the official list of "priority" candidate cities for future expansion.  The list includes [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], a return to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Montreal]], a second team in [[New York City|New York]] in [[Queens, NY]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in the area of [[Chester, PA]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in the area of [[Collinsville, IL]], and [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].

Garber also explained that the Philadelphia and St. Louis areas are the highest priority candidates for, and closest to becoming the next MLS city.  He said that the league expected one of the two cities to join the league in either 2009 along with Seattle, or 2010 depending on whether the league chose to wait until a stadium was completed in that market or to have the team play their first season in a temporary home.  He also added that the league expected a decision to be made about the future of the league's sixteenth team to be made by the end of January 2008.  <ref name="league_goals"/>

The Philadelphia area is considered among the favorites to win an expansion team, with plans for a new franchise to play in a [[Chester Stadium|new soccer-specific stadium]] in neighboring [[Chester, PA]].<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news Philadelphia wins support for MLS franchise plan]</ref>

St. Louis is also in the running for an expansion team because there is approval in the city of [[Collinsville, Illinois]] to build a soccer-specific stadium in that community to improve the economic fortunes of that town. This city is planned to get a rail link and is only ten miles from St. Louis, in fact there are pictures of the stadium site showing that the [[Gateway Arch]] is visible from the site. The St. Louis area has one of the highest youth soccer participations in the country and a number of American soccer players were born there.

Garber characterized the difference between the chances of Philadelphia and St. Louis as one in which the Philadelphia ownership group was well established and was finalizing plans for a stadium, while the community in St. Louis has paved the way for a stadium complex and an ownership group was in the process of being finalized.

===Team names===
:''For more information on MLS team names, see the individual team entries.''

Originally, in the style of other U.S. sports, teams were given nicknames at their creation such as the Columbus Crew, San Jose Clash or Tampa Bay Mutiny. DC United and Miami Fusion FC were the two exceptions that adopted more traditional names. However, new teams such as Real Salt Lake, Houston Dynamo, and Toronto FC have been adopting names similar to popular European clubs.

===Stadiums===
<!--FOR THE LAST TIME, the plural of stadium is BOTH stadiums and stadia. This article is based on a sports league in America, and American English more commonly uses "stadiums". Please consult WP:ENGVAR if your aversion to American English is THAT strong. -Roehl Sybing -->
When the league was started, most clubs played in stadiums built specifically for [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] (college) [[American football|football]]. This was based on the record attendances achieved at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. However, this turned out to be a considerable expense to the league because of modest attendance and poor lease deals. To provide better facilities as well as to control revenue for the stadium, a major goal of MLS management is to build its own stadiums, which are often called [[soccer-specific stadium]]s.

Since 1999, the league has seen the construction and completion of six venues specifically designed for soccer. [[Lamar Hunt]] broke new ground in this endeavor by financing the construction of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]]. The [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] followed four years later with the opening of [[The Home Depot Center]] in [[2003 Major League Soccer season|2003]]. The new venue played host to two consecutive MLS Cups, until [[FC Dallas]]' [[Pizza Hut Park]] opened in [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]] and hosted the next two championships. Chicago Fire began playing their home games in [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in [[2006 Major League Soccer season|2006]], a venue that witnessed the MLS All-Stars defeating [[Chelsea F.C.]] in the All-Star Game, and a US Open Cup championship for the Fire in their first season in the stadium. [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]] saw the opening of [[Dick's Sporting Goods Park]] for the [[Colorado Rapids]], and [[BMO Field]] for the expansion [[Toronto FC]].

[[Image:PHP 2005.jpg|left|250 px|thumb|[[Pizza Hut Park]], home of [[FC Dallas]].]]

Future plans include new venues for the [[Red Bull New York|New York Red Bulls]] and [[Real Salt Lake]] by [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008]], while [[DC United]], the [[Kansas City Wizards]], and [[San Jose Earthquakes]] are actively searching for ways to finance and build their respective stadiums.

The move to soccer-specific stadiums has been seen by many as essential to building up attendance and fan support for MLS. So far, every club that has built its own stadium has not only seen its game attendance rise, but also has helped MLS to come closer to the ultimate goal of profitability. Thanks to their new stadium, the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] became the first club to make a profit, and were followed in 2006 by [[FC Dallas]]. With the league's new TV rights for the 2007 season, several more clubs are projected to be profitable.

Other MLS teams will, in the foreseeable future, continue to play in larger stadiums designed for football. The [[New England Revolution]] play in [[Gillette Stadium]], whose primary tenant is the NFL's [[New England Patriots]], and [[Houston Dynamo]] play in [[Robertson Stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of Houston]]. [[Houston Dynamo]] has secured an agreement with city officials that has entered them into negotiations to build a soccer-specific stadium in downtown Houston near [[Minute Maid Park]], home of MLB's [[Houston Astros]]. The [[New England Revolution]] has also expressed interest in securing their own soccer-specific stadium.

===Media coverage===
At the outset, MLS signed deals for coverage on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]] and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]], while Univision broadcast matches in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The original Univision deal lapsed after a few years, leaving only the ABC/ESPN family of networks as the league's national broadcasters. Fox Sports World (later rebranded as [[Fox Soccer Channel]] in 2005), [[Fox Sports en Espa<U+00F1>ol]] and [[HDNet]] began airing matches in 2003.

With the addition of [[Toronto FC]], coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007. The [[CBC Television|CBC]], [[The Score Television Network|The Score]] and [[Rogers Sportsnet]] all broadcast Toronto matches nationwide. 

The league's [[MLS Direct Kick]] package, which broadcasts out-of-market matches, has been expanded to ensure that every league match is broadcast. Univision and its family of networks resumed MLS broadcasts in 2007 as well, with most matches airing on [[Telefutura]] and [[Galavision]] on Sunday afternoons and evenings.

The 2007 season was the first in the fledgling league's history in which every regular season match was telecast live, and the majority indeed were shown on national networks.  "MLS Primetime Thursday" on ESPN networks featured a live match for the first time on Thursdays each week, and [[Fox Soccer Channel]]'s "MLS Saturday" expanded to a 3-hour format, with both a pregame and postgame show wrapped around the featured match each week.  Additionally, Fox Soccer Channel produces their own news on MLS and special original programs on players, such as "Beckham Unwrapped", a biographical update for summer 2007 on Galaxy's [[David Beckham]].

Major League Soccer also offers streaming live video of some matches via their own website.

===Profitability===
Major League Soccer has lost more than $350 million since its founding, according to a report by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' in [[2004]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch.]</ref> However, there are positive signs for profitability in the near future. As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands and television coverage increases, MLS has managed to see their revenues increase while costs are kept to a minimum. The 2003 season saw the Los Angeles Galaxy make a profit in their first season at the Home Depot Center, while FC Dallas turned a profit in a similar fashion after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005. With the expansion of the league to 13 teams, the signing of the TV rights deal, and the construction of 2 more soccer specific stadiums, the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' reports the league is expecting 5 teams to make a profit this season.[http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?id=3ba8f90e-7d6e-4a46-b1af-b0dfd4fa4519&ParentID=2fd72ff3-49a5-49ea-a647-68e73d84eba6&MatchID1=4500&TeamID1=2&TeamID2=6&MatchType1=1&SeriesID1=1122&MatchID2=4489&TeamID3=8&TeamID4=10&MatchType2=2&SeriesID2=1121&PrimaryID=4500&Headline=Beckham+poised+to+become+face+of+football+in+US] 

Television coverage has consistently expanded throughout the league's history, with MLS brokering a deal with [[ESPN]] in 2006 for rights fees and greater presence across its networks. 2007 will also see a return of MLS to [[Univision]] and its Spanish-language networks. They will join [[Fox Soccer Channel]] and [[HDNet]] as MLS' national outlets, while the league has mandated that every league game receive television coverage, if not nationally, then by at least locally in one of the two teams' cities. 

In 2007, MLS started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who are already advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international soccer.[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06271/725842-28.stm] The league has established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal. Towards the end of the 2007 season, six of the league's thirteen teams have signed sponsorship deals to have company logos placed on the front of their team jerseys. 
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said on May 11, 2006 that he expects the league's clubs to be profitable by 2010 overall. He stated that FC Dallas and LA Galaxy are already profitable, with several other clubs nearing profitability.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/sports/20060511-120809-9655r.htm MLS:Franchises to profit by 2010]</ref>. 

Recently there have been some potential investors expressing reservations about the MLS leadership's decisions on bringing in designated players and the raised franchise fee. One such potential MLS investor is [[Seattle Sounders]] owner Adrian Hanauer, who was quoted by ESPN: "But at this point to me the franchise fee has gone up to $30 million, plus there is the expectation of a stadium being built so it will cost someone another $30 million. So you're up to $60 million and you're going to lose money operationally. Operational costs and start-up costs are what's holding us back, that is fair to say. We have been looking for partners to do it with, but I won't do it alone."[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=416868&cc=5901] 

"Underlying the concerns of potential investors such as [[Milan Mandaric|Mandaric]] and Hanauer is the belief that while there is good reason to be excited, money is still being lost. Beckham will count for nothing if crowds and viewing figures don't increase when the Galaxy aren't in town, or if his era doesn't produce the first crop of U.S. superstars."-ESPN's Andrew Rogers 

Others, like FC Dallas President & General Manager [[Michael Hitchcock]], while accepting the validity of the concerns, disagree on the future outlook of the league's finances. "We still have some teams losing money," he said, "but the positive thing is they are not losing lots of money because of our single entity structure. Expense on some levels are shared and revenues on some levels are shared. The losses are going down every year for the league. The financials for the league and the individual clubs are becoming more and more positive. We have a slow growth model and key to this is developing the American player and not wanting to dilute the product, which other leagues in the U.S. have done and made the mistake of expanding too quickly."[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=416868&cc=5901] 

The ''Las Vegas Sun'', in an interview with MLS President [[Mark Abbott]], noted that "the sale of D.C. United showed that MLS could be turning a major financial corner, with each of its teams eventually being independently owned and the likelihood of each soon playing in a soccer-specific stadium. Los Angeles and Dallas are now making money, and three more plan to be operating in the black by next season."[http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sports/2007/jun/09/566683114.html] According to Don Garber in a statement made to the New York Times, the three newly profitable franchises are expected to be Chicago (Fire), Denver (Colorado Rapids), and Toronto. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/sports/soccer/08beckham.html?ex=1186372800&en=8ac84814e27d5891&ei=5070].

===Ownership===
MLS operates under a single-entity structure in which teams are centrally controlled by the league. In order to keep costs under control, revenues are shared among the league, and player contracts are negotiated by the league.

Some critics have regularly alleged that the league showed preferential treatment to big-market or profitable clubs with regards to player allocation and the salary cap. The league also fought a bitter legal battle with its players over its economic system, but this was eventually resolved with the players gaining some improved benefits in return for accepting the single entity structure. A court had also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.

The league's controlled costs have attracted new ownership that can put more money into the league and improve it by focusing their money and attention on fewer clubs. Examples include the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]'s sale of the MetroStars to [[Red Bull]], "in excess of $100 million," according to the ''New York Times''. MLS Commissioner Garber said to the ''Los Angeles Times'' that "the sale was part of a plan to have AEG decrease its holdings in MLS. We're pushing [[Lamar Hunt#Major League Soccer|Hunt Sports]] to do the same thing."

It appears that Commissioner Garber and MLS management has said it is pushing these changes as part of a new ownership strategy, one in which each owner has a single club, and is better able to focus their resources upon that club, as with the owners of Red Bull New York and Real Salt Lake. Commissioner Garber has stated that having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the first 10 years of MLS, but now that the league appears to be on the brink of overall profitability and has significant expansion plans, he wants each club to have its own owner.  

In order to help bring this about, the league is now giving more incentive to be an individual club owner, with all owners now having the rights to any player they develop through their club's academy system, sharing the profits of [[Soccer United Marketing]], MLS' media and marketing arm, and now for the first time, allowing owners to have individual club jersey sponsors, with the approval of the league office.

AEG, at one time, owned six teams in MLS, and have since sold the Colorado Rapids, MetroStars, DC United and Chicago Fire to new owners. AEG's remaining teams are the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Houston Dynamo. Most recently AEG sold the Chicago Fire to [[Andell Holdings]] for an undisclosed sum of money [http://www.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070906&content_id=115581&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp].  The other major owner-investor in MLS is [[Lamar Hunt#Major League Soccer|Hunt Sports]], which owns the Columbus Crew and FC Dallas, having sold the Kansas City Wizards in 2006 to a [[OnGoal|local ownership group]].

With the sale of the Chicago Fire in mid-2007 and announcement of the new San Jose Earthquakes, the league now has 12 owners for their 14 clubs.

===Rules changes===
MLS experimented with deviations from FIFA rules and standards in its early years, some of which had been used in the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] and continue to be used in [[NCAA]] soccer and many high-school conferences.

Among them was the use of a countdown clock -- rather than a standard progressive clock -- with time paused for dead ball situations at a referee's discretion. Halves ended when the clock reached 0:00, rather than at the whistle of the referee as was customary elsewhere.

Also implemented was the use of shootouts to resolve tie games. These best-of-five contests pitted a player 35 yards from goal with five seconds to put the ball past a goalkeeper; if needed the shootout headed into extra frames. A winning team received one standings point (as opposed to three for the regulation win).

While FIFA rules allow teams to substitute three players during games, MLS allowed a fourth, goalkeeper-only substitute. MLS discarded the rule after 2003 and adopted the FIFA standard, prompted in part by a match in which [[MetroStars]] coach [[Bob Bradley]] used a loophole to insert outfield player [[Eddie Gaven]] as a fourth substitute.

MLS eventually conceded that the rules changes, particularly the shootout, had alienated some traditional soccer fans while failing to draw new American sports fans as hoped. The shootout and countdown clock were eliminated after the 1999 season. 

MLS continued to experiment with the settling of tie games in regular-season play. In 2000, a 10-minute [[golden goal|golden-goal]] period replaced the shootout for tied games. It was abandoned after 2003. The golden-goal overtime remained through 2004 for playoff matches, where it had been used since the league's start.

In 2005 the league adopted a playoff extra-time structure that followed new FIFA standards for such situations: two full 15-minute periods, followed by penalty kicks if necessary.
