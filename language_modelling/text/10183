'''Courtney Act''' is one of the semi-finalists of ''[[Australian Idol]]'' in [[2003]]. However she is only the third singer of the competition to release an official/solo single, following [[Guy Sebastian]] and [[Shannon Noll]]. This single is <U+201C>Rub Me Wrong<U+201D> and was released in [[2004]], peaking at #29 in the ARIAnet Singles Chart.

Courtney Act (a play on the phrase <U+201C>caught in the act<U+201D>) is actually the ''nom de guerre'' of <U+201C>gender illusionist<U+201D> Shane Jenek. Shane auditioned for ''Australian Idol'' as himself but did not get beyond the selection auditions. Returning the next day as Courtney, he wowed the judges and went through to the semifinals. Revealing impressive voice and singing talents as well as a stage presence considerably ahead of many of the other contestants, he/she continued until being finally voted off in thirteenth place. Courtney particularly impressed judge [[Ian Dickson|Ian <U+201C>Dicko<U+201D> Dickson]], who signed Jenek to the [[BMG]] label following the completion of the show.

Shane Jenek is a native of [[Brisbane]], but now lives in [[Sydney]].
