'''''Mother Fish''''', also known as '''''Missing Water''''', is a feature film written, produced and directed by 2005 [[Young Australian of the Year]] [[Khoa Do]]. The film draws largely from Khoa Do's own experiences as a Vietnamese refugee, <ref>[http://www.vietfilmfest.com/2011/general/khoa-do-mother-fish-interview/ Interview with Khoa Do, director of MOTHER FISH : ViFF: Vietnamese International Film Festival - Official Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2948408.htm At the Movies: Mother Fish Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and reflects on the perceived fear in the general population generated by '[[boat people]]' which is prevalent in Australian politics and discourse. <ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/scapegoating-boat-people-a-trueblue-australian-tradition-20100809-11tzl.html Asylum Seekers Scapegoated For Political Gain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Development ==

Mother Fish was an original play written by [[Khoa Do]] and produced by Powerhouse Youth Theatre.  <ref>[http://www.pyt.com.au/pyt/2009/major-shows/mother-fish-tour/ Mother Fish at PYT<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The play drew from Khoa Do's own experience arriving by boat to Australia in the 1980's, when he was two years old. <ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.sbs.com.au/films/movie/3412/Mother-Fish--a.k.a.-Missing-Water- Mother Fish (a.k.a. Missing Water) | Reviews, Trailers, News, Interviews, Discussion | SBS Film<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Do has stated that the development of the film was highly personal, and it's intention was for the audience to empathise with the plight of [[boat people]]. <ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/local/audio/2009/06/08/2592043.htm Missing water tells the story of the boat people - ABC Sydney - Australian Broadcasting Corporation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The film communicates this message by ending with the astounding statistic that between 1975 and 1996 over 1,500,000 people fled Vietnam. Of those, only 900,000 made land meaning that 600,000 were lost at sea. Of the survivors, approximately 137,000 came to Australia.  <ref>[http://www.realtimearts.net/article/98/9993 RealTime Arts - Magazine - issue 98 - boat people: intimate tragedy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Plot ==
Mother Fish follows the story of a middle-aged Vietnamese woman (Hyen Nguyen) working in a suburban sweatshop. In the evening when the workers have left, she is transported back to the night she and her sister (Sheena Pham) fled her homeland, led by an uncle promising to reunite them with their father.

Through the setting of the sweatshop, the woman remembers the journey. The boat is unprepared for the ocean crossing, as are they. Food and water supplies are low, their engine breaks, and the threat of rape and death at the hands of South-sea pirates is real. Through the woman's memory the audience relives the experience of crossing the ocean in search of a better life. <ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1661067/ Mother Fish (2010) - IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== Production == 
A defining feature of Mother Fish is that it was shot in a similar style to [[Lars von Trier]]'s [[Dogville]], by setting all the action entirely within the sweatshop. <ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2948407.htm At the Movies: Mother Fish<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated3 />

Do chose to work with first-time actors who had all either been refugees or descendants of refugees. <ref name=autogenerated1>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:CYkxwRoslbgJ:www.crc.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/10566/Dendy_Award_2009.pdf+missing+water+film&hl=en&gl=au&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESj_EgDtV_rOnAU5UdezdQWW12TmpxTzYFZK5aUlkfSHJ-xk63zszk3gTtbEAOLKdhA2aokr4IEMNiySICI6fAnvltHKPHlbY_i3j9cv8t2EDbU-MhgOhjNC6RWg1ShbN3vt4vOP&sig=AHIEtbRE937wKwbPYkyK1-_zaU7H-XstDw Powered by Google Docs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Hieu Phan, who plays the woman's Uncle, was a refugee who made the crossing 30 years ago, and has spoken of weeping in rehearsals as the memory of his own boat journey came back to him. <ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1826162/sydney_film_festival_official_competition_continues/ ROTTEN TOMATOES: Sydney Film Festival: Official Competition Continues<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> While shooting, the cast were kept on a strict monitored diet to lose weight in a similar manner to refugees who had made the crossing. <ref>[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/movies/sheena-pham-star-of-missing-water-at-sydney-film-festival/story-e6frexli-1225728984418 Sheena Pham star of Missing Water at Sydney Film Festival | thetelegraph.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Mother Fish received largely positive reviews. <ref name=autogenerated3 /> It scored four stars from [[Margaret Pomeranz]] and three and a half stars from [[David Stratton]] on the program [[At the Movies]]. <ref name=autogenerated2 />

Reviewers generally debated Khao Do's daring approach of creating the boat trip out of the space of the sweatshop, however performances were generally critically praised for their 'honesty', usually driven by the actors own backgrounds. <ref>[http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=17073&s=Reviews Urban Cinefile MOTHER FISH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
