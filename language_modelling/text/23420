gives this date. However there have been other dates also proposed. See [[Adi Shankara#Dates|above]]</ref> also known as '''{{IAST|<U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Bhagavatp<U+0101>d<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya}}''' ("the teacher at the feet of [[Ishvara|God]]"), and '''{{IAST|<U+0100>di <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kar<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya}}''' ("the first Shankara in his lineage")<ref>''Adi'' means "the first"; the heads of a few [[Hindu]] [[matha]]s are also given the title ''[[Shankaracharya]]''; ''Acharya'' means "teacher"</ref> was the first philosopher to consolidate the doctrine of [[Advaita Vedanta]], a sub-school of [[Vedanta]]. His teachings are based on the unity of the [[jiva|soul]] and [[Brahman]], in which Brahman is viewed as [[Nirguna Brahman|without attributes]]. In the [[Smartism|Sm<U+0101>rta]] tradition, Adi Shankara is regarded as an incarnation of [[Shiva]].

Adi Shankara toured [[India]] with the purpose of propagating his teachings through discourses and debates with other philosophers. He founded four [[#mathas|mathas]] ("monasteries") which played a key role in the historical development, revival and spread of post-Buddhist  [[Hinduism]] and Advaita Vedanta.  Adi Shankara was the founder of  the [[Dashanami Sampradaya|Dashanami]] monastic order and the [[Shanmata]] tradition of worship.

His works in [[Sanskrit]], all of which are extant today, concern themselves with establishing the doctrine of Advaita ([[Sanskrit]], "Non-dualism"). Adi Shankara quotes extensively from the [[Upanishads]] and other [[Hindu scriptures]] in forming his teachings. He also includes arguments against opposing schools of thought like [[Samkhya]] and [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhism]] in his works.

==Life==
The traditional accounts of Adi Shankara's life are called the [[Shankara Vijayams]], ("Victory of Shankara"). These are poetic works containing a mix of biographical and legendary material, written in the epic style. The most important among these [[biography|biographies]] are the ''{{IAST|M<U+0101>dhav<U+012B>ya <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Vijaya<U+1E43>}}'' (of M<U+0101>dhava, c. [[14th century]]), the ''{{IAST|Cidvil<U+0101>s<U+012B>ya <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Vijaya<U+1E43>}}'' (of Cidvil<U+0101>sa, c. between [[15th century]] and [[17th century]]), and the ''{{IAST|Kera<U+013C><U+012B>ya <U+015A>a<U+1E45>kara Vijaya<U+1E43>}}'' (of the [[Kerala]] region, extant from c. [[17th century]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html |title=The ''Sankaravijaya'' literature |accessdate=2006-08-23 |author=Vidyasankar, S.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

</ref> According to these texts, Adi Shankara was born in [[Kalady]], a village in Kerala, [[India]], to a [[Namboothiri]] [[brahmin]] couple, Shivaguru and Aryamba and lived for thirty-two years.

===Birth and childhood===
[[Image:Kaladi shankarabirthplace.jpg|thumb|250px|The birth place of Adi Shankara at [[Kalady]]]]
Adi Shankara's parents were childless for many years. They prayed at the [[Vadakkunnathan temple]] (also known as ''Vrishachala'') in [[Thrissur]], Kerala, for the birth of a child.<ref>{{cite book
 | last =Tapasyananda
 | first =Swami
 | year = 2002
 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
 | pages=14
 }}
</ref> Legend has it that [[Shiva]] appeared to both husband and wife in their dreams, and offered them a choice: a mediocre son who would live a long life, or an extraordinary son who would not live long. Both the parents chose the latter; thus a son was born to them. He was named Shankara (Sanskrit, "bestower of goodness"), in honour of [[Shiva]] (one of whose epithets is ''[[Shankara]]'').<ref>{{cite book

His father died while Shankara was very young. Shankara's {{IAST|[[upanayanam|upanayana<U+1E43>]]}}, the initiation into student-life, was performed at the age of five. As a child, Shankara showed remarkable scholarship, mastering the four [[Vedas]] by the age of eight. Following the customs of those days,  Shankara studied and lived at the home of his teacher. It was customary for students and men of learning to receive {{IAST|Bhik<U+1E63><U+0101>}} ("alms") from the [[laity]]; on one occasion, while accepting {{IAST|Bhik<U+1E63><U+0101>}}, Shankara came upon a woman who had only a single dried [[Indian gooseberry|amalaka fruit]] to eat. Rather than consuming this last bit of food herself, the lady gave away the fruit to Shankara as {{IAST|Bhik<U+1E63><U+0101>}}. Moved by her piety, Shankara composed the Kanakadh<U+0101>r<U+0101> Stotram on the spot. Legend has it that on completion of this [[stotra]], golden amalaka fruits were showered upon the woman by {{IAST|[[Lakshmi|Lak<U+1E63>mi]]}}, the Goddess of wealth.<ref>{{cite book

}}
</ref>

===Sannyasa===

From a young age, Shankara was attracted to [[sannyasa]] ("monastic life"). His mother was against his becoming a monk, and refused him formal permission. However, once when Shankara was bathing in the [[Periyar River|Purna River]] near his house, a crocodile gripped his leg and began to drag him into the water. Only his mother was nearby, and it proved impossible for her to rescue him. Shankara asked his mother to give him permission to renounce the world then and there, so that he could be a sanny<U+0101>sin at the moment of death. This mode of entering the renunciatory stage is called ''<U+0100>pat Sanny<U+0101>sa''. At the end of her wits, his mother agreed. Shankara immediately recited the [[mantra]]s to make a renunciate of himself. Miraculously, the crocodile released him and swam away. Shankara emerged unscathed from the water.<ref>{{cite book

| pages=40-50
}}
</ref>

With the permission of his mother, Shankara left Kerala and travelled towards [[North India]] in search of a [[Guru]]. On the banks of the [[Narmada River]], he met [[Govinda Bhagavatpada]], the disciple of [[Gaudapada]]. When Govinda Bhagavatpada asked Shankara's identity, he replied with an extempore verse that brought out the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy. Govinda Bhagavatapada was impressed and took Shankara as his disciple.<ref>{{cite book
| last = Tapasyananda
 | first =  Swami
 | year = 2002
 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
| pages=51-56
}}
</ref>
Adi Shankara was commissioned by his Guru to write a commentary on the [[Brahma Sutra]]s and propagate Advaita Vedanta. The ''M<U+0101>dhav<U+012B>ya Shankaravijaya'' states that Adi Shankara calmed a flood from the [[Narmada River|Reva River]] by placing his ''{{IAST|kama<U+1E47><U+1E0D>alu}}'' ("water pot") in the path of the raging water, thus saving his Guru, Govinda Bhagavatpada, who was absorbed in {{IAST|[[Samadhi|Sam<U+0101>dhi]]}} ("meditation") in a cave nearby. 

On his mission to spread the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, Adi Shankara travelled to [[Varanasi|Kashi]], where a young man named [[Padmapada|Sanandana]] from [[Chola dynasty|Choladesha]] in [[South India]], became his first disciple. In Kashi, Adi Shankara was on his way to the [[Vishwanath Temple]], when he came upon an [[Dalit|untouchable]] with four dogs. When asked to move aside by Shankara's disciples, the untouchable replied: "Do you wish that I move my ever lasting [[Atman (Hinduism)|<U+0100>tman]] ("the Self"), or this body made of food?" Understanding that the untouchable was none other than [[Deva (Hinduism)|god]] [[Shiva]], and his dogs the four [[Vedas]], Shankara prostrated himself before him, composing five [[shloka]]s known as [[Manisha Panchakam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celextel.org/adisankara/manishapanchakam.html |title=Manisha Panchakam |accessdate=2006-08-04 |author=Adi Shankara}} </ref><ref>{{cite book

}}
</ref>

On reaching [[Badrinath|Badari]] in the [[Himalayas]], he wrote the famous ''Bhashyas'' ("commentaries") and ''Prakarana granthas'' ("philosophical treatises"). Afterwards he taught these commentaries to his disciples. Some, like Sanandana, were quick to grasp the essence; the other disciples thus became jealous of Sanandana. In order to convince the others of Sanandana's inherent superiority, Adi Shankara summoned Sanandana from one bank of the [[Ganga River]], while he was on the opposite bank. Sanandana crossed the river by walking on the lotuses that were brought out wherever he placed his foot. Adi Shankara was greatly impressed by his disciple and gave him the name {{IAST|[[Padmap<U+0101>da]]}} ("lotus-footed one").<ref>{{cite book

===Meeting with Mandana Mishra===
One of the most famous debates of Adi Shankara was with the [[Mimamsa|ritualist]] [[Mandana Mishra]]. Mandana Mishra's [[Guru]] was the famous [[Mimamsa]] philosopher, {{IAST|[[Kumar<U+012B>la Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a]]}}. Shankara sought a debate with {{IAST|Kumar<U+012B>la Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a}} and met him in [[Prayag]] where he had buried himself in a slow burning pyre to repent for sins committed against his Guru: {{IAST|Kumar<U+012B>la Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a}} had learnt [[Buddhist philosophy]] incognito from his Guru in order to be able to refute it. This constitutes a sin according to the [[Vedas]].<ref>{{cite book
| last = Tapasyananda
 | first =  Swami

 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
| pages=77-80
}}
</ref> {{IAST|Kumar<U+012B>la Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a}} thus asked Adi Shankara to proceed to {{IAST|Mahi<U+1E63>mati}} (known today as Mahishi (Bangaon, [[Saharsa]] in [[Bihar]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1upindia.com/pilgrimages/maheshwar.html
| title=Pilgrimages- Maheshwar

|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> to meet Mandana Mishra and debate with him instead.

Adi Shankara had a famous debate with Mandana Mishra in which the wife of Mandana Mishra, {{IAST|Ubhaya Bh<U+0101>rat<U+012B>}}, was the referee. After debating for over fifteen days, Mandana Mishra accepted defeat.<ref>{{cite book
| last = Tapasyananda
 | first =  Swami
 | year = 2002
 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
| pages=81-104
}}
</ref> {{IAST|Ubhaya Bh<U+0101>rat<U+012B>}} then challenged Adi Shankara to have a debate with her in order to 'complete' the victory. This debate was to be on the subject of ''[[kamashastra|{{IAST|k<U+0101>ma<U+015B><U+0101>stra}}]]'' ("science of sex-love"). But Adi Shankara, being a sannyasi, had no knowledge of this subject; thus, after requesting for some time before entering into this fresh debate, he entered the body of a king by his [[yoga|yogic]] powers and acquired the knowledge of {{IAST|k<U+0101>ma<U+015B><U+0101>stra}}. Later, however, {{IAST|Ubhaya Bh<U+0101>rat<U+012B>}} declined to debate with him and allowed Mandana Mishra to accept sannyasa with the [[yoga patta|monastic name]], {{IAST|[[Sure<U+015B>vara|Sure<U+015B>var<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya]]}} as per the agreed rules of the debate.<ref>{{cite book

</ref>

===Dig-vijaya===
[[Image:Sringeri Sharadha temple.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Sharada temple at [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham]], [[Sringeri]]]]
Adi Shankara then travelled with his disciples to [[Maharashtra]] and  [[Srisailam]]. In Srisailam, he composed [[Shivanandalahari]], a devotional hymn to [[Shiva]]. The ''Madhaviya Shankaravijayam'' says that when Shankara was about to be sacrificed by a [[Kapalika]], the god [[Narasimha]] appeared to save Shankara on [[Padmapada]]'s prayer to him. So Adi Shankara composed the Laksmi-Narasimha stotra.<ref>{{cite book
| last = Tapasyananda
 | first =  Swami
 | year = 2002
 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
| pages=130-135
}}
</ref> 
He then travelled to {{IAST|[[Gokarna|Gokar<U+1E47>a]]}}, the temple of Hari-Shankara and the {{IAST|[[Mookambika|M<U+016B>kambika]]}} temple at [[Kollur]]. At Kollur, he accepted as his disciple a boy believed to be dumb by his parents. He [[yoga patta|gave him the name]], {{IAST|[[Hastamalakacharya|Hast<U+0101>malak<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya]]}} ("one with the [[Indian gooseberry|amalaka]] fruit on his palm", i.e., one who has clearly realised the Self). Next, he visited {{IAST|[[Sringeri|<U+015A><U+1E5B>ngeri]]}} to establish the {{IAST|[[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|<U+015A><U+0101>rada P<U+012B><U+1E6D>ham]]}} and made {{IAST|[[Totakacharya|To<U+1E6D>ak<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya]]}} his disciple.<ref>{{cite book
| last = Tapasyananda
 | first =  Swami
 | year = 2002
 | title = Sankara-Dig-Vijaya
| pages=136-150
}}
</ref>

After this, Adi Shankara began a ''Dig-vijaya'' (missionary tour) for the propagation of the Advaita philosophy by controverting all philosophies opposed to it. He travelled throughout India, from [[South India|the South]] to [[Kashmir]] and [[Nepal]], preaching to the local populace and debating philosophy with Hindu, Buddhist and other scholars and monks along the way.

With the [[Malayali]] King Sudhanva as companion, Shankara passed through [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Vidarbha]]. He then started towards [[Karnataka]] where he encountered a band of armed [[Kapalika]]s. King Sudhanva, with his army, resisted and defeated the Kapalikas. They safely reached [[Gokarna]] where Shankara defeated in debate the [[Shaiva]] scholar, Neelakanta.

Proceeding to [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] (the ancient [[Kambhoja]])<ref>'''See Link''': [http://www.geocities.com/advaitavedant/shankarabio.htm].</ref> and having visited the shrines of Girnar, Somnath and Prabhasa and explaining the superiority of Vedanta in all these places, he arrived at [[Dwarka]]. {{IAST|Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a Bh<U+0101>skara}} of [[Ujjain|Ujjayini]], the proponent of Bhed<U+0101>beda philosophy, was humbled. All the scholars of Ujjayini (also known as [[Avanti]]) accepted Adi Shankara's philosophy. 

He then defeated the [[Jainas]] in philosophical debates at a place called [[Bahlika]]. Thereafter, the Acharya established his victory over several philosophers and ascetics in [[Kamboja]] (region of North [[Kashmir]]), [[Darada]] (Dabistan) and many regions situated in the desert and crossing mighty peaks, entered Kashmir. Later, he had an encounter with a [[tantra|tantrik]], Navagupta at [[Kamarupa (History)|Kamarupa]].<ref>{{cite book

===Accession to Sarvajnapitha===
[[Image:Adi shankara.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Statue of Adi Shankara at his Samadhi Mandir in Kedarnath, India]]Adi Shankara visited ''{{IAST|Sarvaj<U+00F1>ap<U+012B><U+1E6D>ha}}'' ([[Sharada Peeth]]) in [[Kashmir]] (now in [[Pakistan-occupied Kashmir]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/setlurbadri/album?.dir=/e51b

}}</ref> The ''Madhaviya Shankaravijayam'' states this [[mandir|temple]] had four doors for scholars from the four cardinal directions. The southern door (representing [[South India]]) had never been opened, indicating that no scholar from South India had entered the Sarvajna Pitha. Adi Shankara opened the southern door by defeating in debate all the scholars there in all the various scholastic disciplines such as [[Mimamsa]], [[Vedanta]] and other branches of [[Hindu philosophy]]; he ascended the throne of Transcendent wisdom of that temple.<ref>{{cite book

Towards the end of his life, Adi Shankara travelled to the Himalayan area of [[Kedarnath]]-[[Badrinath]] and attained ''[[videha mukti]]'' ("freedom from embodiment"). There is a samadhi mandir dedicated to Adi Shankara behind the Kedarnath temple. However, there are variant traditions on the location of his last days. One tradition, expounded by ''Keraliya Shankaravijaya'', places his place of death as [[Vadakkunnathan temple]] in [[Thrissur]], Kerala.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> The followers of the Kanchi kamakoti pitha claim that he ascended the ''{{IAST|Sarvaj<U+00F1>ap<U+012B><U+1E6D>ha}}'' and attained ''[[videha-mukti]]'' in Kanchipuram ([[Tamil Nadu]]).

===Dates ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Adi Shankara]] -->

Modern scholarly opinion is that Shankara's date should lie somewhere in the mid-8th century CE. It has proved impossible to reach agreement on Adi Shankara's precise dates of birth or death. Traditional sources from the Shankara {{IAST|Ma<U+1E6D>has}} give two different dates; some cite [[788]] &ndash; [[820]] CE, while others cite [[509]] &ndash; [[477]] BCE. The {{IAST|[[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|<U+015A><U+1E5B><U+1E45>geri <U+015A><U+0101>rad<U+0101> P<U+012B><U+1E6D>ham]]}} accepts the [[788]] &ndash; [[820]] CE dates.<ref> {{cite book

</ref><ref>The dating of 788-820 is accepted in Keay, p. 194.</ref> Of the other major Shankara {{IAST|Ma<U+1E6D>has}} active today, the ones at Dwaraka, Puri and Kanchi ascribe the dates [[509]] &ndash; [[477]] [[BCE]] to Adi Shankara.

}} </ref>  (See also [[#Mathas|Mathas]]). According to Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati's biography of Adi Shankara, published in his book ''Sannyasa Darshan'', Adi Shankara was born in Kalady, Kerala, in [[686]], and attained mahasamadhi at Kedarnath, [[Uttarakhand]], in [[718]].

Adi Shankara founded four {{IAST|[[Matha|Ma<U+1E6D>has]]}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+0920>}}) to guide the Hindu religion. These are at [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Sringeri]] in [[Karnataka]] in the south, [[Dwaraka P<U+012B>tha|Dwaraka]] in [[Gujarat]] in the west, [[Govardhana matha|Puri]] in [[Orissa]] in the east, and [[Jyotirmath]] (Joshimath) in [[Uttarakhand]] in the north. Hindu tradition states that he put in charge of these mathas his four main disciples: [[Sure<U+015B>vara|Sureshwaracharya]], [[Hastamalakacharya]], [[Padmap<U+0101>da|Padmapadacharya]], and [[Totakacharya]] respectively. The heads of the mathas trace their authority back to these figures. Each of the heads of these four mathas takes the title of [[Shankaracharya]] ("the learned Shankara") after the first Shankara.
The table below gives an overview of the four ''Amnaya Mathas'' founded by Adi Shankara and their details.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.sringerisharadapeetham.org/html/History/amnaya.html |title=Adi Shankara's four Amnaya Peethams |accessdate= 2006-08-20|}}</ref>

== Philosophy and religious thought ==
{{main|Advaita Vedanta}}

[[Image:SwansCygnus olor.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Hamsa (Hindu mythology)|swan]] is an important motif in [[Advaita Vedanta]]. Its symbolic meanings are: firstly; upon verbally repeating ''hamsa'' (the Sanskrit word for ''Swan''), it becomes ''soham'' (Sanskrit, "I am That"). Secondly, even as a swan lives in water its feathers are not soiled by water, a liberated Advaitin lives in this world full of maya but is untouched by its illusion. Thirdly, a [[Sannyasi|monk]] of the [[Dashanami]] order is called a ''[[Paramahamsa]]'' ("the supreme swan")]]

''Advaita'' ("non-dualism") is often called a [[monism|monistic]] system of thought. The word "Advaita" essentially refers to the identity of the Self ([[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]) and the Whole ([[Brahman]]<ref>''Brahman'' is not to be confused with [[Brahma]], the Creator and one-third of the [[Trimurti]] along with [[Shiva]], the Destroyer and [[Vishnu]], the Preserver.</ref>). The key source texts for all schools of {{IAST|Ved<U+0101>nta}} are the [[Prasthanatrayi]]&ndash; the canonical texts consisting of the [[Upanishad]]s, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahma Sutras]].

Adi Shankara was the first in its tradition to consolidate the {{IAST|siddh<U+0101>nta}} ("doctrine") of Advaita Vedanta. He wrote commentaries on the [[Prasthana Trayi]]. A famous quote from {{IAST|[[Viveka Chudamani|Vivekac<U+016B><U+1E0D><U+0101>ma<U+1E47>i]]}}, one of his ''prakarana granthas'' that succinctly summarises his philosophy is: <Blockquote>''{{IAST|Brahma satya<U+1E43> jagat mithy<U+0101>, j<U+012B>vo brahmaiva n<U+0101>parah}}'' </Blockquote> <Blockquote>[[Brahman]] is the only truth, the world is unreal, and there is ultimately no difference between Brahman and individual self.</Blockquote>

Advaita Vedanta is based on ''{{IAST|<U+015B><U+0101>stra}}'' ("scriptures"), ''yukti'' ("reason") and ''anubhava'' ("experience"), and aided by ''[[karma (Hinduism)|karmas]]'' ("spiritual practices").<ref>See ''"Study the Vedas daily. Perform diligently the duties ("karmas") ordained by them"'' from [http://www.sankaracharya.org/sadhana_panchakam.php Sadhana Panchakam] of Adi Shankara</ref> This philosophy provides a clear-cut way of life to be followed. Starting from childhood, when learning has to start, the philosophy has to be realised in practice throughout one's life even up to death. This is the reason why this philosophy is called an experiential philosophy, the underlying tenet being "That thou art", meaning that ultimately there is no difference between the experiencer and the experienced (the world) as well as the universal spirit ([[Brahman]]). Among the followers of Advaita, as well those of other doctrines, there are believed to have appeared ''[[Jivanmukta]]s'', ones liberated while alive. These individuals (commonly called ''[[Mahatma]]s'', great souls, among [[Hindu]]s) are those who realised the oneness of their self and the universal spirit called Brahman.
Some of the Translated philosophies of Adi Shankara are - [[Adi Sanakara Philosophy]].

Adi Shankara's Bhashyas (commentaries) on the [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Brahma Sutra]]s are his principal and almost undeniably his own works. Although he mostly adhered to traditional means of commenting on the Brahma Sutra, there are a number of original ideas and arguments to establish that the essence of Upanishads is Advaita. He taught that it was only through direct knowledge of [[Brahman]] that one could be enlightened. 

Adi Shankara's opponents accused him of teaching Buddhism in the [[garb]] of Hinduism, because his non-dualistic ideals were a bit radical to contemporary Hindu philosophy. However, it may be noted that while the Later Buddhists arrived at a changeless, deathless, absolute truth after their insightful understanding of the unreality of [[samsara]], historically Vedantins never liked this idea. Although Advaita proposes the theory of [[Maya (Hinduism)|Maya]], explaining the universe as a "trick of a magician", Adi Shankara and his followers see this as a consequence of their basic premise that [[Brahman]] alone is real. Their idea of Maya emerges from their belief in the reality of Brahman, rather than the other way around.

==Historical and cultural impact==

At the time of Adi Shankara's life, [[Hinduism]] had begun to decline because of the influence of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].  Hinduism had become divided into innumerable sects, each quarrelling with the others. The followers of [[Mimamsa]] and [[Sankhya]] philosophy were atheists, insomuch that they did not believe in [[Ishvara|God]] as a unified being. Besides these atheists, there were numerous theistic sects. There were also those who rejected the Vedas, like the [[Charvaka]]s.

Adi Shankara held discourses and debates with the leading scholars of all these sects and schools of philosophy to controvert their doctrines. He unified the theistic sects into a common framework of [[Shanmata]] system. In his [[#works|works]], Adi Shankara stressed the importance of the Vedas, and his efforts helped Hinduism regain strength and popularity. Many trace the present worldwide domination of Vedanta to his works. He travelled on foot to various parts of India to restore the study of the Vedas. 

Even though he lived for only thirty-two years, his impact on India and on Hinduism was striking. He reintroduced a purer form of [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] thought. His teachings and [[sampradaya|tradition]] form the basis of [[Smartism]] and  have influenced [[Sant Mat]] lineages.<ref> {{cite paper

</ref> He is the main figure in the tradition of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. He was the founder of  the ''{{IAST|[[Dashanami Sampradaya|Da<U+015B>an<U+0101>mi Samprad<U+0101>ya]]}}'' of [[Hindu]] [[monasticism]] and ''[[Shanmata|{{IAST|<U+1E62>a<U+1E47>mata}}]]'' of Smarta [[sampradaya|tradition]]. He introduced the ''{{IAST|[[panchayatana puja|Pa<U+00F1>c<U+0101>yatana]]}}'' form of [[puja|worship]].

Adi Shankara, along with [[Madhvacharya|Madhva]] and [[Ramanuja]], was instrumental in the revival of Hinduism. These three [[acharya|teachers]] formed the doctrines that are followed by their respective sects even today. They have been the most important figures in the recent history of [[Hindu philosophy]]. In their writings and debates, they provided [[polemic]]s against the non-Vedantic schools of [[Sankhya]], [[Vaisheshika]] etc. Thus they paved the way for [[Vedanta]] to be the dominant and most widely followed tradition among the schools of Hindu philosophy. The Vedanta school stresses most on the [[Upanishads]] (which are themselves called Vedanta, ''End or culmination of the [[Vedas]]''), unlike the other schools that gave importance to texts authored by their founders. The Vedanta schools have the belief that the Vedas, which include the Upanishads, are unauthored, forming a continuous tradition of wisdom transmitted orally. Thus the concept of ''apaurusheyatva'' ("being unauthored") came to be the guiding force behind the Vedanta schools. However, along with stressing the importance of [[Vedic]] [[sampradaya|tradition]], Adi Shankara gave equal importance to the personal experience of the student. [[Indian logic|Logic]], [[vyakarana|grammar]], [[Mimamsa]] and allied subjects form main areas of study in all the Vedanta schools.

A well known verse, recited in the Smarta tradition, in praise of Adi Shankara is:

{{Hindu philosophy}}
Adi Shankara's works deal with logically establishing the doctrine of [[Advaita Vedanta]] as he saw it in the [[Upanishads]]. He formulates the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta by validating his arguments on the basis of quotations from the [[Vedas]] and other [[Hindu scriptures]]. He gives a high priority to ''sv<U+0101>nubhava'' ("personal experience") of the student. His works are largely [[polemic]]al in nature. He directs his polemics mostly against the [[Sankhya]], [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddha]], [[Jaina]], [[Vaisheshika]] and other non-vedantic [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosophies]].

Traditionally, his works are classified under {{IAST|Bh<U+0101><U+1E63>ya}} ("commentary"), {{IAST|Prakara<U+1E47>a gratha}} ("philosophical treatise") and Stotra ("devotional hymn"). The commentaries serve to provide a consistent interpretation of the scriptural texts from the perspective of Advaita Vedanta. The philosophical treatises provide various [[methodology|methodologies]] to the student to understand the doctrine. The devotional hymns are rich in poetry and piety, serving to highlight the relationship between the [[bhakti|devotee]] and the [[deva (Hinduism)|deity]].

Adi Shankara wrote ''Bhashyas'' on the ten [[mukhya|major]] [[Upanishads]], the [[Brahma Sutra]]s and the [[Bhagavad Gita]]. In his works, he quotes from Shveshvatara, Kaushitakai, Mahanarayana and Jabala Upanishads, among others. ''Bhashyas'' on Kaushitaki, Nrisimhatapani and Shveshvatara Upanishads are extant but the authenticity is doubtful.<ref>{{cite web

In his [[Brahma Sutra]] Bhashya, Adi Shankara cites the examples of [[Dharmavyadha]], [[Vidura]] and others, who were born with the knowledge of [[Brahman]] acquired in previous births. He mentions that the effects cannot be prevented from working on account of their present birth. He states that the knowledge that arises out of the study of the [[Vedas]] could be had through the [[Puranas]] and the [[Itihasa]]s. In the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] Bhashya 2.2, he says:<ref>{{cite web

Among the independent philosophical treatises, only Upade<U+015B>as<U+0101>hasr<U+012B> is accepted as authentic by modern academic scholars. Many other such texts exist, among which there is a difference of opinion among scholars on the authorship of [[Viveka Chudamani]]. The former pontiff of Sringeri Math, Shri Shri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] has written a voluminous commentary on the Viveka Chudamani.
