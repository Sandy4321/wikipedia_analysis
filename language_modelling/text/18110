"'''I Want You'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Janet Jackson]] for her eighth studio album, ''[[Damita Jo (album)|Damita Jo]]'' (2004). It was released April 5, 2004, by [[Virgin Records]] as the second single from the album. It was written by [[Kanye West]], [[John Legend]], Harold Lilly, [[Miri Ben-Ari]], [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]], while it was produced by Jackson, West, and [[Jam & Lewis]]. The mid-tempo ballad consists of a [[retro]] sound and arrangement, paying homage to the classic pop sound of the [[Motown]] era. Its composition is based on Jackson's passion and desire for an estranged lover. "I Want You" is notable for being among the first singles produced with West and co-written by Legend, who were both upcoming artists at the time.

The song received positive reviews by [[Music journalism|music critics]], who complimented Jackson's vocals and its fusion of nostalgic and modern qualities. The song's performance was largely affected by the [[blacklisting]] of Jackson's singles and music videos worldwide due to [[FCC]] fines regarding her controversial [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl Halftime Show incident]], with conglomerates such as [[Viacom]] and [[CBS]] enforcing the boycott. "I Want You" reached the top twenty in airplay prior to stalling due to the blockage, also becoming Jackson's thirty-third consecutive top forty hit on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&B Songs]] chart. The blacklisting drew controversy amongst critics, who declared the song to likely have been an "across-the-board smash" song had the incident not occurred.

"I Want You" was certified [[Platinum certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and received a [[47th Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]]. The song's music video was directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] and portrays Jackson traveling through Los Angeles to meet her boyfriend. It was not aired on [[MTV]] or several other music channels owned by Viacom and CBS due to their boycott of Jackson following her Super Bowl performance incident. During promotional campaign for ''Damita Jo'', Jackson performed "I Want You" various occasions, including ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

==Background==
"I Want You" was written by [[Kanye West]], [[John Legend]], Harold Lilly, [[Miri Ben-Ari]], [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]], while it was produced by Jackson, West, and [[Jam & Lewis]].<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t6888200|pure_url=yes}} "I Want You" - Janet Jackson] [[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] Retrieved May 10, 2010.</ref> It was initially titled "Have Your Way with Me" in its early stages, and was the only song from the album which Jackson did not co-write, along with "Thinkin' 'Bout My Ex", written by [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]]. Describing the song, Jackson said, "It's a different kind of song for me, it's more of like a throwback. More of a [[doowop|doowoop-y]] [feel], which I've never done before which is quite exciting, and I enjoyed recording it in the studio."<ref name="Damita"/> John Platt, senior Vice President of [[Virgin Records]] and [[EMI Publishing]], commented that ''Damita Jo'' "is really about positive love and where she's at in her life right now. The second half of the album was very easy once me and Janet got to know each other, and found the songs that really were true to her and that she can sing with conviction. That's why there's so much passion in this "I Want You" record, that's where she's at in her life right now."<ref name="Access"/>

West first collaborated with Jackson several months prior to the release of his debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004). West stated, "I don't want to talk about it before it comes out, but it'll be unbelievable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479799/kanye-west-talks-jay-z-tracks.jhtml|title=Kanye West Promises Big Things From Janet, Jay-Z Collabos|publisher=[[MTV News]].

===Blacklist===
{{Quote box|width=250px|align=left|quote=
"CBS and MTV<U+2019>s parent company Viacom, angered that an unannounced addition to the Super Bowl performance has now cost them all future halftime shows, hits back at Jackson by essentially blacklisting her, keeping her music videos off their properties MTV, VH1, and radio stations under their umbrella.

"I Want You", along with Jackson's other singles from ''Damita Jo'' and her following two albums, was [[blacklisted]] by many major radio formats following her controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show incident, regarding several media conglomerates receiving massive [[FCC]] fines in its aftermath, such as [[Viacom]], which owns many radio formats, [[MTV]], and [[CBS]], which broadcast the event and owns [[Clear Channel Communications]].<ref name="Kreps">{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/nipple-ripples-10-years-of-fallout-from-janet-jacksons-halftime-show-20140130|title=Nipple Ripples: 10 Years of Fallout From Janet Jackson's Halftime Show|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]] |last=Kreps|first= Daniel|accessdate=January 31, 2014|date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The blacklisting of Jackson drew attention and commentary from music critics; many deciding the song to likely have achieved much greater success if the blockage had not occurred.

It debuted on March 16, 2004, on [[BET]]'s ''[[Access Granted]]''.<ref name="Access"/> Intended to resemble Brooklyn, New York, the video was shot in Los Angeles. It portrays Jackson traveling through the city at night to meet her boyfriend, interacting with the various people she encounters along the way.<ref name=cast/> Jackson commented that the video was simple, and there was not a major production for wardrobe, hair and makeup. Explaining its concept, she stated "I'm coming out of my apartment building and walking down the street, and you see all the goings-on in the neighborhood." Jackson praised Meyers as a director, saying "I think he's a wonderful director and he's a good friend, we've been friends since the "All for You" video. He has a great eye."<ref name="Access">{{cite episode|title=Janet Jackson <U+2013> Making of I Want You video|series= Access Granted|serieslink=Access Granted|credits= |network=[[BET]] |station= |airdate=March 16, 2004 |season=4 |seriesno=7|number= |minutes=30:00 |accessdate= May 23, 2014|language=English}}</ref> [[Hollywood]] casting agents sought a wide variety of extras, ranging from teenage delinquents to mothers picking up her babies and children from day care, and other people commuting by bus to and from work.<ref name=cast>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/janet-searches-for-video-stars|title=Janet Searches For Video Stars|publisher=Contactmusic.com.

<blockquote>
"The song has kind of an old school vibe to it, so we wanted to be really stripped down and really simple with the video. Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did [[Feel It Boy|another video]] with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion."<ref name="Access"/>
</blockquote>

A portion of the clip's premise was inspired by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer [[Jermaine Dupri]], which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, "In the [[Just a Little While|other video]] we were shooting, she came out of the trailer wearing a [[So So Def]] jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is [[Jermaine Dupri|JD]]'s in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'"<ref name="Access"/>

The video begins with Jackson leaving her apartment before walking through the city's various settings, including a grocery store before taking the bus, and ends with Jackson entering a [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] recreation center to visit her then-boyfriend, record producer Jermaine Dupri. Along with Dupri, actor [[Bobb'e J. Thompson]] makes a brief cameo. Jackson is shown wearing her trademark midriff-baring outfits and naval piercing in the clip. A scene of Jackson purchasing [[Trojan condoms]] was filmed to promote [[safe sex]], but was omitted from the final video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/janet-cuts-condom-scenes|title=Janet Cuts Condom Scenes|publisher=Contactmusic.com. Channel 4|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> Jackson previously included a similar message at the finale of her video for "[[Any Time, Any Place]]" (1994).<ref name="Access"/>

===Release and reception===
The video generally received positive reception, although Dupri's cameo was ultimately panned. A review considered the portrayal of Jackson "walking down some really shady parts of the neighbourhood in pursuit of Jermaine Dupri" as unrealistic.<ref name=nottingham/> In an interview with Launch.com, Jackson said she was not hesitant to feature Dupri in the video, although revealed it was the director's idea to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://launch.yahoo.com/read/feature.asp?contentID=218225|title=Get Ur Freak On|date=May 20, 2004|accessdate=May 23, 2004|publisher=Launch.com.

===Blacklist===
Following her highly controversial Super Bowl incident, Jackson's singles and music videos were blacklisted by various entertainment conglomerates involved with the event who received massive FCC fines, including Viacom, which owns MTV, VH1, and co-produced the event, and CBS, which aired the event and owns Clear Channel Communications.<ref name="Kreps"/> A senior executive for Viacom stated, "[We are] absolutely bailing on the record. The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure."<ref>{{cite journal|title=|url=|date=June 2004|accessdate=May 24, 2014|journal=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|publisher=Alpha Media Group|location=New York|issn=0265-1548|ref=harv|pages=128}}</ref> As a result, the video for "I Want You" video, in addition to other releases from ''Damita Jo'' and Jackson's following two albums, received minimal or no rotation on major music channels, despite Jackson's appeal and iconic status in [[pop culture]]. In British publication ''[[Music Week]]'', Virgin Record's marketing director Elizabeth Nordy stated MTV's lack of support due to the Super Bowl incident had been a "major catalyst" in the performance of Jackson's singles.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Change of Direction for Janet?|url=|date=June 9, 2004|accessdate=May 24, 2014|journal=[[Music Week]]|publisher=Intent Media|location=London|issn=0265-1548|ref=harv}}</ref> Jam also responded to an MTV statement claiming the network never received Jackson's videos, while it was sent to the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eurweb.com/articles/headlines/08162004/headlines1589908162004.cfm|title= Jimmy Jam exclusive|date=February 17, 2004|accessdate=May 23, 2014|archiveurl=http://lists.topica.com/lists/EURmail/read/message.html?sort=d&mid=1717358904|archivedate=August 16, 2004|publisher=Eurweb}}</ref>
