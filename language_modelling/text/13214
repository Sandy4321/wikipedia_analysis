'''Traffic signal preemption''' is a type of system that allows the normal operation of [[traffic light]]s to be [[preempt]]ed, often to assist [[emergency vehicles]].  The most common use of these systems is to allow [[emergency vehicle]]s [[priority]] by changing traffic signals in the path of the vehicle to green (or in some cases, flashing green <ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.womanmotorist.com/index.php/news/main/5618/event=view/|accessdate=2007-06-05|title=Red, Stop. Green, Go. Flashing Red, Stop. But Flashing Green?}}</ref>) and stopping conflicting [[traffic]]<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/gadgetbuzz/0,39041749,39352801,00.htm|title=Gadget Buzz|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=cnet.com}}</ref>.  Sometimes, signal preemption is also used at [[railroad]] [[grade crossing]]s to prevent [[collision]]s, and by [[light rail|light-rail]] and [[bus rapid transit]] systems to allow [[public transportation]] priority access through intersections to ensure they are able to remain on schedule and improving [[commute]] [[time]]s.

The key advantages of signal preemption include their ability to reduce [[response time]] for emergency services and to increase [[safety]] on the [[road]].  

These devices generally operate by use of invisible [[infrared]] signals or by visible [[strobe light]]s.  Each emergency vehicle is equipped with an '''emitter''', a device which emits visible flashes of light or invisible infrared pulses at a specified [[frequency]].  '''Receiver''' devices placed on or near intersection traffic control devices recognize the signal and preempt the normal cycle of traffic lights.  Once the emergency vehicle passes through the intersection and the receiving device no longer senses the remote triggering device, normal operation resumes.  Some systems can be implemented with varying frequencies assigned to specific types of uses, which would then allow an intersection's preemption equipment to differentiate between a fire engine and a bus sending a signal simultaneously, and then grant priority access first to the fire engine.

There are limitations inherent in the standard signal preemption systems, which rely on [[line-of-sight]] communication between the [[emergency vehicle]] and the [[receiver]].  This leads to some intersections unnecessarily being impacted, and conversely other intersections not receiving the signal in time to clear the intersection for the approaching emergency vehicle.  Short-term solutions to these issues have been addressed by the relatively remote placement of receivers (on a pole above the [[traffic signal]], or around a corner that approaches an intersection, for example), and also with physical additions to receiver designs that are less likely to pick up signals unless they are originating from a location certain to be in the path approaching the intersection covered.  Research into [[dynamic route clearance]] has been made to solve these problems and improve traffic preemption with centrally-based route command and control.

A common implementation of signal preemption systems is a method of communicating to the emergency vehicle operator as well as civilian drivers that a traffic signal is under control of a preemption device.  Known as a '''notifier''', this device is almost always an additional light located near the traffic signals.  It may be a single [[light bulb]] visible to all, which flashes or stays on, or it may be a more sophisticated system such as that available with the OptiCom system from [[3M]] where a spotlight is aimed in each direction.  The spotlight will either flash or stay on, which communicates to all drivers which direction a preempting signal is being received from.  This informs regular drivers which direction may need to be cleared, and informs emergency vehicle drivers if they have control of the light (especially important when more than one emergency vehicle approaches the same intersection).
