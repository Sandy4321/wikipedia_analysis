'''Raw foodism''' is a lifestyle promoting the consumption of uncooked, unprocessed, and often [[organic food]]s, as a large percentage of the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Depending on the type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a select<U+0131>on of '''''raw''''' [[fruits]], [[vegetables]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[seed]]s (including sprouted [[whole grain]]s), and sometimes, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[fish]], [[meat]] and [[Pasteurization|unpasteurized]] [[dairy]] products (such as [[raw milk]], [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]).

A ''raw foodist'' is a person who consumes primarily raw food, or all raw food, depending on how strict the person is. Raw foodists typically believe that the greater the percentage of raw food in the diet, the greater the health benefits. Some believe raw food highly encourages weight loss and prevents and/or heals many forms of [[sickness]] and many [[chronic disease]]s that are seen as incurable by the medical community. [[Freezing]] food is considered acceptable by many raw foodists; although decreasing enzyme activity,{{Fact|date=September 2007}} it is still a raw food - and some choose to preserve nuts and seeds in a [[freezer]].

== Background ==
=== History ===
Raw food, being the diet of almost every species of animal for all time, necessarily dates to [[prehistoric]] eras, before humans began [[cooking]] with [[fire]]. Some believe that prehistoric humans were largely [[vegetarian]]s, and thus that, the [[human digestive system]] is configured for [[raw vegetarianism]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Others believe their primitive ancestors were chiefly hunters who ate raw meat.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

Raw foods gained more prominence throughout the [[20th century|1900's]], as proponents such as [[Ann Wigmore]] and [[Herbert Shelton]] claimed that a diet of raw [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s is the ideal diet for humans. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[Artturi Ilmari Virtanen|Artturi Virtanen]] ([[1895]]-[[1973]]), a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning biochemist, showed that [[enzymes]] in uncooked foods are released in the mouth when vegetables are chewed. It is believed that these enzymes interact with other substances, notably the enzymes produced by the body itself, to aid the digestion process.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} (This research was unrelated to his [[Nobel Prize]].)

[[Leslie Kenton]]'s book, ''[[The New Raw Energy]],'' in [[1984]] popularized food such as sprouts, seeds, and fresh vegetable juices, which are now moving into the mainstream. The book brought together research into raw foodism and its support of health, citing examples such as the [[Hunza diet|sprouted seed enriched diets]] of the long lived [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[Hunza people]], as well as [[Max Gerson]]'s claim of a raw juice-based [[cancer]] cure. The book advocates a diet of 75% raw food in order to prevent degenerative diseases, slow aging, provide enhanced energy, and boost emotional balance.

The raw food lifestyle has gained acceptance, although not all nutrition experts condone it.  Restaurants catering to this diet have opened, especially in large cities,<ref>[http://www.live-food.com/resources/locations.html]</ref> and numerous all-raw cookbooks have been published.<ref>[http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net/Amazon/VegRawFoods.htm]</ref> Celebrities including [[Demi Moore]] and [[Woody Harrelson]], who have been known to follow a raw food diet, provide additional exposure.<ref>[http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/food_and_drink/reviews/article351374.ece The Independent]</ref>

"Supercharge Me! 30 Days Raw" is a documentary feature film of an overweight woman who allowed her <U+2018>experiment<U+2019> to be filmed showing the beneficial effects of a 30 day vegan, organic raw food detox diet.<ref>"Supercharge Me! 30 Days Raw" [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercharge_Me]</ref>

===Beliefs===
Those who follow this way of eating may believe:
*Raw foods contain [[enzymes]] which greatly aid in their own digestion, freeing the body's own enzymes to do the work unimpeded of regulating all the body's many metabolic processes. Heating food degrades or destroys these enzymes in food, putting the onus on the body's own enzyme production. 
*Eating food without enzymes makes digestion more difficult, deprives the body of enzymes, and leads to [[toxicity]] in the body, to excess consumption of food, and therefore to [[obesity]] and to [[chronic disease]].
*Raw foods contain [[bacteria]] and other [[micro-organisms]] that stimulate the [[immune system]] and enhance [[digestion]] by populating the [[digestive tract]] with [[Gut flora|beneficial flora]].
*Raw foods have higher [[nutrient]] values than foods which have been cooked.
*Wild foods, particularly edible wild plants are particularly nutritious raw foods.<ref>[http://www.living-foods.com/articles/davidinterview.html Interview of David Wolfe, co-author of ''Nature's First Law: The Raw Food Diet'', by Bob Avery.]</ref><ref>An Invitation from Sergei. Raw Family Newsletter, June 2007.  [http://archives.zinester.com/1819/133854.html?rss=1 Statement on Wild Edibles]</ref>

The benefits of the diet are said to include: a stable [[body mass index]], clear [[skin]], more energy, and minimising a range of common illnesses, from the [[flu]] to obesity-related illnesses.

Some raw food advocates believe cooked food is [[toxic]] because cooking the food converts some particles into harmful chemicals. They also often believe cooked food is less digestible than raw food because cooking destroys the [[enzyme]]s contained in food. One source for this belief is the work of [[Artturi Virtanen]], a biochemist.

Anthropologist [[Peter Lucas]] of [[George Washington University]] in [[Washington, DC]], US, was reported in [[New Scientist]] magazine in [[2005]] as having the theory that man being the only mammal with chronic poor [[dentition]], and the only mammal to significantly process and cook his food, are causally linked. He believes that the adoption of food processing and cooking reduced the size of our jaw through evolutionary processes, but not the size of our teeth.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

==Research==
===Early 20th century===
A [[1933]] paper by E. B. Forbes says, "Cooking renders food pasty, so that it sticks to the teeth, and undergoes acid [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]]. Furthermore, the cooking of food greatly diminishes the need for use of the teeth; and thus tends to diminish the [[circulation]] of blood to the jaws and teeth, and to produce under-development of the [[maxillary]] and contiguous bones<U+2014>thus leading to contracted [[dental arch]]es, and to [[malocclusion]] and [[dental impaction|impaction]] of the teeth, with complications of great seriousness."<ref>The Ohio Journal of Science. Vol. 33, No.5 (September, 1933), 389-406</ref>

In a [[1936]] work entitled ''[[Nutrition and Physical Degeneration]]'', dentist [[Weston A. Price]] observed dental degeneration in the first generation who abandoned traditional nutrient dense foods which included unprocessed raw foods e.g. un-pasteurised milk products, fruit and dried meats. Price claimed that the parents of such first generation children had excellent jaw development and dental health, while their children had [[malocclusion]] and tooth decay and attributed this to their new modern insufficient nutrient diet (which would have included a proportion of raw food).

Dr. Edward Howell, an [[Illinois]] physician, wrote ''[[Food Enzymes for Health & Longevity]]'' in 1941. Forty years later he published ''[[Enzyme Nutrition]]'', a book which claimed that the [[pancreas]] is forced to work harder on a diet of cooked foods, and that food enzymes are just as essential to digestion as the body's self-generated enzymes. The book was based largely on ideas from his previous book, and ideas derived from early enzyme research from the 1930s before it was established that enzymes were proteins.

===Recent research===
==== Raw dairy products ====

A study by the [[University of Toronto]] and another published in the [[Journal of the National Cancer Institute]] suggest that ingesting cooked or pasteurized [[dairy|dairy products]] may increase risk of [[colon cancer]]. The increased risk is due to the effect of heating [[casein]], a [[phosphoprotein]] found in dairy products.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=2208161&dopt=Abstract Promotion of colonic microadenoma growth in mice and rats fed cooked sugar or cooked casein and fat]</ref><ref>[http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/13/1026?ck=nck Promotion of Aberrant Crypt Foci and Cancer in Rat Colon by Thermolyzed Protein]</ref>

==== Raw meat ====

Several studies published since [[1990]] indicate that cooking [[meat|muscle meat]] creates [[heterocyclic amines]] (HCA's), which are thought to increase cancer risk in humans.<ref name="nci-hca">[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/heterocyclic-amines National Cancer Institute - Heterocyclic Amines in Cooked Meats]</ref> While eating muscle meat raw may be the only way to avoid HCA's fully, the [[National Cancer Institute]] states that cooking meat below 212<U+00BA>[[fahrenheit|F]] (100<U+00BA>[[celsius|C]]) creates "negligible amounts" of HCA's. Also, [[microwaving]] meat before cooking may reduce HCA's by 90%.<ref name="nci-hca"/>

==== Raw vegetables ====

[[Germany|German]] research in [[2003]] showed significant benefits in reducing [[breast cancer]] risk when large amounts of raw vegetable matter are included in the diet. The authors attribute some of this effect to heat-labile [[phytonutrients]].<ref>Nutr Cancer. 2003;46(2):131-7</ref>

===Pottenger's Research===

Research was conducted by Dr. [[Francis Pottenger]] in [[1932]] to determine the effect of cooked foods in [[cat]]s. For 10 years, Pottenger fed half of the cats a diet of raw meat, the other half a diet of cooked meat. At the conclusion of his study, he reported that the cats who were fed raw meat appeared to be in better health. In addition, the exclusively cooked diet led to congenital problems including birth defects and deformities, after several generations.<ref>[http://www.ppnf.org/catalog/ppnf/Articles/PottsCats.htm Pottenger's Cats - A Study in Nutrition]</ref>

Pottenger's study was conducted in a time before the nutritional needs of cats was understood - especially the role of [[taurine]] in the diet. Since cats cannot synthesize adequate amounts of taurine, they must get taurine from food. Heat renders taurine inactive; cooked food without taurine supplements can cause health problems in cats. However, this finding does not apply to humans - since humans, like most other animals, synthesize their own taurine.<ref>[http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1h.shtml Lesson of the Pottenger's Cats Experiment--Cats are Not Humans]</ref>

However, when comparing the cats fed 1/3 raw meat and 2/3 raw milk to the cats fed 1/3 raw meat and 2/3 pasteurized milk, there were significant differences in the pasteurized cats, including an undeveloped heart, fatty atrophy of the liver, and poor intestinal tone.<ref>[http://www.realmilk.com/ppt/RawMilk.PPT#445,43,Raw Milk vs. Pasteurized There IS a difference!]</ref>

However the point was made that changing from a traditional diet of several thousand years could result in serious health problems in only a few generations.

==Raw food movement==

Early proponents include [[Johnny Love-Wisdom]], [[Ann Wigmore]] and [[Viktoras Kulvinskas]] (co-founders of the [[Hippocrates Health Institute]]), [[Arnold Ehret]] (author and authority on [[fasting]]), [[A Hovannessian]] and [[Norman W. Walker]] (who advocated the consumption of juices, living up to the age of 99 years{{Fact|date=February 2007}}).

The principles of [[Natural hygiene]] promote a mainly [[raw veganism|raw vegan diet]]. Famous natural hygienists have included [[Herbert Shelton]] and [[Anthony Robbins]].

==Raw food diet practices==
===Food preparation===
Many foods in raw food diets are simple to prepare, such as fruits, salads, meat, and dairy. Other foods can require considerable advanced planning to prepare for eating. [[Rice]] and some other grains, for example, require [[sprouting]] or overnight soaking to become digestible.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Many raw foodists believe it is best to soak nuts before eating them, in order to activate their [[enzymes]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Preparation of ''gourmet'' raw food recipes usually call for a [[blender (device)|blender]], [[food processor]], [[juicer]], and [[Drying (food)|dehydrator]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Depending on the recipe, some food (such as crackers, breads and cookies) may need to be dehydrated. These processes, which produce foods with the taste and texture of cooked food, are lengthy.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Some raw foodists dispense with these foods, feeling that there is no need to emulate the other non-raw diets.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Care may be required in planning a raw food diet, especially for children. There is little research on how to plan a nutritionally adequate raw food diet; however, nutritionists and raw M.D.s are usually willing to provide professional advice.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Raw foodists claim that with sufficient [[food energy]], essential fatty acids, variety and density, people of all ages can be successful at eating raw foods, although whether the diet works for any one person depends on their unique metabolism.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Avoiding poisoning===

As the consumption of raw foods gains popularity, some unsafe foods have re-entered the diets of humans. The following should be consumed with caution:

* [[Buckwheat]] greens are toxic when raw, particularly if juiced or eaten in large quantities by fair skinned individuals. The chemical component [[fagopyrum]] is known to cause severe [[photosensitivity]] and other [[dermatology|dermatological]] complaints.<ref>{{cite web

* [[Kidney beans]], including sprouts, are toxic when raw.<ref>N.D. Noah, A.E. Bender, G.B. Reaidi, and R.J. Gilbert. "Food poisoning from raw red kidney beans." ''British Medical Journal'' [[1980]] [[July 19]];281(6234):236-7.</ref>
* [[Rhubarb]]: when eaten in sufficient quantity, leaves can be toxic when raw, stalks are completely safe to eat when harvested early.
* [[Potatoes]]: a member of the [[nightshade]] family, can produce the toxic alkaloid [[solanine]].  The flesh of the potato just beneath the skins is usually green if solanine is present, but one may be present without the other. Solanine can be removed by peeling the potatoes, or neutralized by cooking in a deep fryer.<ref>[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntpweb/index.cfm?objectid=6F5E933B-F1F6-975E-7B1D19DE73F21505 Raymond Tice]</ref>  In processed potatoes such as chips and fries, there is little hazard since peels are removed and they are fried.<ref>The University of Nebraska, Lincoln, <U+201C>The Potato Education Guide: Greening<U+201D> http://www.panhandle.unl.edu/potato/html/greening.htm</ref><ref>Food Science Australia, "Greening of Potatoes" http://www.foodscience.afisc.csiro.au/spuds.htm</ref>  
* Raw foods contain [[bacteria]] and may contain [[parasites]], which may cause [[foodborne illness]]es. Heating to high temperatures destroys most bacteria and parasites.

==Criticism==

===Food enzymes in the stomach===

Some raw foodists claim that ingesting [[enzyme]]s aids digestion in the [[mouth]], [[stomach]], and [[intestines]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The claim about stomach digestion, however, goes against well established knowledge regarding the [[biochemistry]] of enzymes. Enzymes are very sensitive to [[pH]] and their activity will be nullified outside a specific pH range.<ref>Creighton, T.E. ''Proteins - Structures and Molecular Properties'' ISBN 978-0716770305</ref> The digestive enzymes produced by the stomach are active in the low pH (2-4) of the stomach, whereas enzymes found in most foods will be most active at cellular pH (approximately 7).<ref>Berg, J.M.; Tymoczko, J.L.; Stryer L. ''Biochemistry'' ISBN 978-0716767664</ref> 

However, some dietary enzymes such as [[bromelain]] and a protected form of [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD]] have been shown to be absorbed through the intestines and into the bloodstream.{{Fact|date=September 2007}} Also, enzymes found in acidic plant foods, including many fruits, are active at low pH similar to that of the human stomach.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

===Dental malocclusion and cooked food===

The earliest indisputable fossil evidence for the use of fire to prepare food dates to approximately 350,000 years ago.<ref>[http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo/homo_3.htm "Early Human Culture"]</ref> Other evidence traces cooking to more than 1.5 million years ago, well before the emergence of modern humans.<ref>[http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/2004-04-29_ErectusFire.html Rincon, Paul, "Early human fire mastery revealed"]</ref> Evolutionary evidence indicates that the [[musculature]] and bone structure of the [[jaw]] [[evolution|evolved]] away from forms most suited for eating tough raw foods.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=14527628 Wrangham R, Conklin-Brittain N. '''Cooking as a biological trait'.'' Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol. 2003 Sep;136(1):35-46. PMID 14527628]</ref> 

Some critics believe, based on this evidence that humans have evolved to eat cooked foods. Advocates counter that this is repudiated by the incidence of [[malocclusion]] found in cooked-food-eating populations. However, this claim is disputed by dentists who state that malocclusion tends to be an [[inherited trait]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001058.htm Malocclusion of Teeth] viewed August 5, 2006</ref> Research contradicts common opinion amongst dental practitioners and shows that malocclusion is essentially an acquired, and therefore avoidable, trait.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=1998301&query_hl=6&itool=pubmed_DocSum Heritability of craniometric and occlusal variables: a longitudinal sib analysis.]</ref>

However, other research indicates that consumption of softened foods is a major factor in severity of malocclusion, and that the occlusal transition found in one [[Kentucky]] community "could not be genetic in origin."<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=6938135&dopt=Abstract Occlusal variation in a rural Kentucky community]</ref> Other research indicates that [[Taiwanese aborigines]] with nearly ideal [[occlusion]] "have adequate jaw growth since the muscular stimulation from [[mastication]] is quite sufficient," and that "raw, dry sweet [[potato chips]] and vegetables are the major diet items."<ref>[http://jdr.iadrjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/2/117 Dental condition of two tribes of Taiwan aborigines--Ami and Atayal]</ref>

=== Potential damage ===

A [[2005]] study has shown that a raw food [[vegetarian]] diet is associated with a lower [[bone density]].<ref>Fontana L, Shew JL, Holloszy JO, Villareal DT. ''Low bone mass in subjects on a long-term raw vegetarian diet.'' Arch Intern Med. 2005 Mar 28;165(6):684-9. PMID 15795346</ref> This may not be a problem however, as new research appears to indicate that high bone density early in life is associated with [[osteoporosis]], regardless of genetic variation.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15949902&query_hl=1Lifetime high calcium intake increases osteoporotic fracture risk in old age.] .</ref> 

Douglas N. Graham warns that most raw diets obtain a high percentage of daily calories from fats, by including significant amounts of avocado, nuts and seeds. According to him, these diets tend to be unsustainable since too much fat, even raw fat, causes health problems and results in the underconsumption of carbohydrates. He promotes a low-fat raw vegan diet which draws the great bulk of its daily calories from fruits, along with liberal amounts of vegetables and small amounts of nuts and seeds.<ref>[http://www.foodnsport.com/joomla/]</ref>

One study of raw veganism shows [[amenorrhea]] and [[underweight]]ness in women,<ref>Koebnick C, Strassner C, Hoffmann I, Leitzmann C. ''Consequences of a long-term raw food diet on body weight and menstruation: results of a questionnaire survey.'' Ann Nutr Metab. 1999;43(2):69-79. PMID 10436305</ref>
another one increased risk of [[Erosion (dental)|dental erosion]].<ref>Ganss C, Schlechtriemen M, Klimek J. ''Dental erosions in subjects living on a raw food diet.'' Caries Res. 1999;33(1):74-80. PMID 9831783</ref> However, these are all common side effects of eating disorders, and it is possible that some women may use the raw vegan diet to disguise these disorders, so these health problems may not be caused by the diet itself, but by problems with food some followers may have.

Some advocates of raw foodism claim that [[amenorrhea]] may be a normal condition of fertile women, and that indeed [[menstruation]] as most women experience is neither natural nor healthy, but a consequence of intoxication due to unnatural cooked diets.<ref>[http://www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/menstruation.htm]</ref>
