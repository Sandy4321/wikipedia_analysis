'''C-SPAN''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|s|i<U+02D0>|s|p|<U+00E6>|n}}), an acronym for '''Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network''', is an [[United States|American]] [[cable television]] [[Television network|network]] that offers coverage of [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] proceedings and other [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs programming]] via its three television channels (C-SPAN, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3), one radio station and a group of websites that provide [[streaming media]] and archives of C-SPAN programs. C-SPAN's television channels are available to over 100 million cable and satellite households within the [[United States]], while [[WCSP-FM]], also called C-SPAN Radio, is broadcast on FM radio in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is available throughout the U.S. on [[XM Satellite Radio]], and via internet streaming and an [[IPhone#Third-party_applications|iPhone app]].

The network televises U.S. political events, particularly live and gavel to gavel coverage of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] as well as occasional proceedings of the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]s and major events worldwide. Its coverage of political and policy events is unedited, thereby providing viewers (or listeners) with unfiltered information about politics and government. Non-political coverage includes: historical programming, programs dedicated to [[non-fiction]] books and interview programs with noteworthy individuals connected to [[public policy]]. C-SPAN is a [[non-profit]] organization, funded by the [[Network affiliate|affiliate]] fees paid by its [[Cable television in the United States|cable]] and [[Satellite television in the United States|satellite]] affiliates, and does not carry advertisements on any of its networks, radio stations or websites. The network operates independently, and neither the cable industry nor Congress has power over the content of its programming.

==History==
===Development===
[[Brian Lamb]], C-SPAN's [[chairman]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], first conceived of C-SPAN in 1975 while working as the [[Washington, D.C.]] bureau chief of cable industry trade magazine ''Cablevision''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Peer Participation and Software: What Mozilla Has to Teach Government |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |year=2010 |first=David R. |last=Booth |page=81 |isbn=9780262514613}}</ref> It was a time of rapid growth in the number of cable TV channels available in the U.S.,<ref name=Barnhart/> and Lamb envisioned a cable-industry financed non-profit network for televising sessions of the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and other public affairs event and policy discussions.<ref name=NewsCheck>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/04/20/41591/cspan-the-other-washington-monument |title=C-SPAN: The Other Washington Monument |date=20 April 2010 |work=TVNewsCheck.com |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Legislative Television As Political Advertising: A Public Choice Approach |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |first=Franklin G. |last=Mixon |year=2003 |isbn=9780595270866 |page=2}}</ref> Early cable executive [[Bob Rosencrans]] provided the initial seed funding of $25,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/jan05/features3.php|title=Original Cable Guy|accessdate=5 August 2008|work=Columbia College Today}}</ref> for Lamb to launch C-SPAN in 1979<ref name=Barnhart/> and other cable executives followed suit, eventually forming C-SPAN's first board of directors.

C-SPAN was launched on March 19, 1979,<ref>{{cite news |title=Lamb opened government with C-SPAN |newspaper=Journal and Courier |date=3 November 2007}}</ref> in time for the first televised session made available by the House of Representatives, beginning with a speech by then-Tennessee representative [[Al Gore]].<ref name=TWP/><ref>{{cite book |title=The C-Span Revolution |first=Stephen E. |last=Frantzich |coauthor=John Sullivan |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1996 |page=23}}</ref> Upon its debut, only 3.5 million homes were wired to see C-SPAN,<ref name=Marcus>{{cite news |title=Confessions of a C-SPAN Junkie |author=Ruth Marcus |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=18 March 2004}}</ref> and the network had just three employees.<ref name=Wallace>{{cite news |title=Power Player of the Week Brian Lamb |author=Chris Wallace |newspaper=Fox News Network |date=15 August 2004}}</ref> The second C-SPAN channel, C-SPAN2, launched on June 2, 1986<ref name=Shales/> when the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] opened its chambers to TV cameras.<ref name=Ragsdale>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN has taken viewers on tour of history, government for 20 years |author=Shirley Ragsdale |newspaper=Argus Leader  |date=14 March 1999}}</ref> C-SPAN3, the most recent expansion channel, began full-time operations on January 22, 2001,<ref name=Milestones/> and shows other public policy and government-related live events on weekdays along with weekend historical programming.<ref name=NewsCheck/> C-SPAN3 followed a predecessor digital channel called C-SPAN Extra, launched in the Washington-area in 1997, televising live and recorded political events from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST Monday to Friday.<ref name=Milestones/><ref name=Moss>{{cite news |title=Time Warner Gives Lift to C-SPAN3 |author=Linda Moss |newspaper=Multichannel News |date=19 February 2001}}</ref>

[[WCSP-FM|C-SPAN Radio]] launched on October 9, 1997, covering similar events as the TV networks and often [[simulcast]]ing their programming.<ref name=Stoddard>{{cite news |author=A.B.

===Anniversaries===
C-SPAN reached its 10th anniversary in 1989 and celebrated with a three-hour retrospective, featuring Lamb recalling the development of the network.<ref name=Shales>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN, America's Town Hall; Looking Back on the Decade That Brought Government Home |author=Tom Shales |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=3 April 1989}}</ref> The 15th anniversary was commemorated in a more unusual manner; the network launched a series of re-enactments of the seven historic [[Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858]], which were televised from August to October in 1994.<ref name=Hodges>{{cite news |title=Historic debates will mark 15 years of C-SPAN |author=Ann Hodges |newspaper=The Houston Chronicle |date=19 March 1994}}</ref>

[[Robert Byrd]] flips the switch for C-SPAN2 on June 2, 1986.]]In 2003, C-SPAN celebrated its 25th anniversary, by which time the original network was carried in 86 million homes, C-SPAN2 was in 70 million homes and C-SPAN3 was in 8 million homes.<ref name=Barnhart>{{cite news |title=Win like a lamb; C-SPAN remains a reliable source thanks to founder's fair approach |author=Aaron Barnhart |newspaper=Kansas City Star |date=3 May 2003}}</ref> On the anniversary date, C-SPAN repeated the first televised hour of floor debate in the House of Representatives from 1979 and, throughout the month, 25th anniversary features included "then and now" segments with journalists who had appeared on C-SPAN in its early years.<ref name=TWP>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN By the Numbers |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=14 March 2004}}</ref>

To commemorate 25 years of taking viewer calls, in 2005, C-SPAN held a 25-hour "call-in marathon", running from 8:00 p.m. on Friday, October 7, concluding at 9:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 8. The network also held a viewer essay contest, whose winner was invited to host an hour of the broadcast from C-SPAN's Capitol Hill studios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/C-SPAN25/contestwinners.asp |title=C-SPAN's 24-Hour Call-In Marathon  |last1= |first1= |date= |work=c-span.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref>

===Scope of coverage===
C-SPAN continues to expand its coverage of government proceedings, with a history of requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised on C-SPAN.<ref name=FoxNews>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/05/c-span-challenges-congress-open-health-care-talks-tv-coverage/ |title=C-SPAN Challenges Congress to Open Health Care Talks to TV Coverage |date=5 January 2010 |work=FOXNews.com |publisher=FOX News Network |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> Committee meetings on health care were subsequently shown on C-SPAN and are available on the C-SPAN website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/MiniP |title=Mini-Health Insurance Policies |author=C-SPAN |date=1 December 2010 |work=C-SPAN.org |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref> In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming [[House_Speaker#United_States|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House.<ref name=O'Connor>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/15/more-cameras-in-the-house/ |title=More Cameras in the House? |author=Patrick O'Connor |date=15 November 2010 |work=Washington Wire |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request.<ref name=Weiner>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN denied cameras in the House of Representatives, again |author=Rachel Weiner  |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=4 February 2011 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/04/AR2011020407317.html |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> C-SPAN had previously written to Speaker Designate [[Nancy Pelosi]] on December 14, 2006, requesting to add its own cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional floor feeds, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/pdf/npelosi.pdf| title=C-SPAN's Letter to Speaker of House Representatives|last=Lamb|first=Brian P.|date=14 December 2006|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref> The Pelosi request was denied.<ref name=Weiner/> Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner held by the [[Gridiron Club]] have also been denied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34686.html

===Expansion and technology===
Since the late 1990s, C-SPAN has significantly expanded its online presence. In January 1997, C-SPAN began real-time streaming of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 on its website. This was the first time Congress had been live streamed online.<ref name=Milestones/> To cover the Democratic and Republican conventions and the presidential debates in 2008, C-SPAN launched two standalone websites: the Convention Hub and the Debate Hub.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2008/09/26/don%E2%80%99t-like-twitter%E2%80%99s-election-site-c-span-has-a-way-cooler-alternative-really/

C-SPAN began promoting audience interaction early in its history, through the regular incorporation of viewer calls in its programming. It has since expanded into social media, incorporating [[Twitter]] in its broadcasts. In March 2009,<ref name=Milestones/> Twitter became an additional way for viewers to interact with guests on ''Washington Journal'', with users of the service submitting questions live to the C-SPAN call-in program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/21/profiles-in-twittering-c_n_206431.html

In 2010 C-SPAN began a transition to [[HDTV|high definition]] telecasts, planned to take place over an 18-month period.<ref name="NewsCheck"/> The network launched C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 in high definition on June 1, 2010, and C-SPAN3 in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/452819-IN_BRIEF.php |title=Cable Show Draws News Of HD Channel Launches |author= |date=18 May 2010 |work=Multichannel News' |publisher= |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref>

==Programming==
===House and Senate===
The core programming of C-SPAN is live coverage of the U.S. House and Senate, with the primary C-SPAN channel focusing on the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Between 1979 and May 2011, the network has televised more than 24,246 hours of floor action.<ref name="TWP"/> C-SPAN2, the first of the C-SPAN spin-off networks, provides uninterrupted live coverage of the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=Hodges/>  With coverage of the House on C-SPAN and the Senate on C-SPAN2, viewers can track legislation as it moves through both bodies of Congress.<ref name=Newswire/> A few key debates in Congress that C-SPAN has covered live include the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf conflict]] in 1991, and the House impeachment vote and Senate trial of [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=Ragsdale/> During periods when the House or Senate are not in session, C-SPAN channels carry other public affairs programming.<ref name=Newswire>{{cite news |title=C-SPAN2 to be Added to PRIMESTAR's Channel Lineup |author= |newspaper=PR Newswire |date=4 December 1996}}</ref>

===Public affairs===
The public affairs coverage on the C-SPAN networks other than the House and Senate floor debates is wide-ranging. C-SPAN is viewed as a useful source of information for journalists, lobbyists, educators and government officials as well as casual viewers interested in politics, due to its unedited coverage of political events.<ref name=Wallace/> C-SPAN has been described by media observers as a "window into the world of Washington politics"<ref name=Harrington/> and it characterizes its own mission as being "to provide public access to the political process".<ref name=AboutC-SPAN>{{cite web | url=http://www.c-span.org/About/About-C-SPAN/ | title=About C-SPAN | date = | work=c-span.org | accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> The networks cover U.S. political campaigns, including the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] in their entirety. Coverage of presidential campaign events are provided during the duration of the campaign, both on a weekly television program, ''[[Road to the White House]]'',<ref name=Hodges/> and at its dedicated politics website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-span.org/politics/ |title=C-SPAN Politics |author= |date= |work=C-SPAN.org |publisher= |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:C-SPAN 112th Congress Roll Call.jpg|thumb|left|250px|C-SPAN broadcasts the opening of the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] on January 5, 2011.]]All three channels televise events such as White House press briefings and presidential speeches, as well as other government meetings including [[Federal Communications Commission]] hearings and [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] press conferences.<ref name=Gillespie>{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/archives/2010/11/16/the-democratizer |title=The Democratizer |author=Nick Gillespie |date=December 2010 |work=Reason.com |publisher=Reason Magazine |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> Other U.S. political coverage includes [[State of the Union]] speeches,<ref name=Ragsdale/> [[congressional hearing]]s<ref name=Hodges/> and presidential press conferences.

Occasionally, proceedings of the [[Parliament of Canada]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (usually [[Prime Minister's Questions]] and the [[State Opening of Parliament]]) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC Parliament Goes Live On Digital Satellite |newspaper=M2 Presswire |date=25 November 1998}}</ref> Similarly, the networks will sometimes carry news reports from around the world when major events occur<U+2014>for instance, C-SPAN carried [[CBC Television]] coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=Milestones/> Newscasts and other broadcasts in foreign languages are dubbed into [[English language|English]]. Following the deaths of [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan]] in 2004, [[Rosa Parks]] in 2005 and [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|Gerald Ford]] in 2006, C-SPAN featured live, uninterrupted coverage of the visitors who came to the [[Capitol Rotunda]] to pay their final respects and the funeral services.<ref name=Turegano>{{cite news |title=Television did its job as window on America's farewell to Reagan |author=Preston Turegano |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune |date=14 June 2004}}</ref> The network also provided coverage of [[Lady Bird Johnson]]'s funeral in [[Stonewall, Texas]].<ref name=Shannon>{{cite news |title=Lady Bird Johnson, former first lady, remembered at Texas funeral attended by 1,800 |author=Kelley Shannon |newspaper=The Associated Press |date=14 July 2007}}</ref> In 2005, C-SPAN covered [[Hurricane Katrina]] through [[New Orleans|New Orleans']] NBC affiliate [[WDSU]], as well as [[Hurricane Ike]] coverage via Houston's CBS affiliate [[KHOU-TV|KHOU]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Coverage of Gustav tops politics on Day 1 |author=John Timpane |newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=2 September 2008}}</ref> C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect [[Canada|Canadians]], such as the [[Canadian federal elections]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.connect2canada.com/event/electionNight_2008/

In early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by [[Al Jazeera]] to cover the events in [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]] and other Arab nations.<ref name=Milestones/><ref name="Al Jazeera">{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Qadha |title=Moammar Qadhafi Address |date=2 March 2011 |work=c-spanvideo.org |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref> Additionally, C-SPAN simulcasts [[NASA]] Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live, using the footage and audio from [[NASA TV]].<ref name=AlBawaba>{{cite news |title=E-Vision launches C-Span channel on its cable network |author= |newspaper=Al-Bawaba |date=11 June 2009}}</ref>

With its public affairs programming, C-SPAN aims to offer different points of view, by allowing time for multiple viewpoints to be discussed on a given topic. However, this practice is not always successful as in 2004, when C-SPAN intended to televise a speech by [[Holocaust]] [[historian]] [[Deborah Lipstadt]] adjacent to a speech by [[Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]], who had unsuccessfully sued Lipstadt for [[libel]] in the [[United Kingdom]] four years earlier. C-SPAN received criticism for its use of the word "balance" to describe the plan to cover both Lipstadt and Irving.<ref>{{cite web |title=C-SPAN's David Irving contretemps |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_america_updates/individuals/david_irving/irving_update_20050413.htm|date=13 April 2005 |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=29 July  2009}}</ref> Once Lipstadt closed media access to her speech, C-SPAN canceled coverage of both.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lipstadt/Irving Libel Trial |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/Lipst |publisher=C-SPAN |accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref>

The network strives for [[Objectivity (journalism)|neutrality]] and a lack of [[bias]];<ref name=Barnhart/> in all programming, the content is the focus and when on-camera hosts are present their role is simply to facilitate and explain proceedings to the viewer.<ref name=Barnhart/> Due to this policy, no C-SPAN host has said his or her own name on television.<ref name="Wallace"/>

===C-SPAN and C-SPAN2 flagship programs===

===Special programming===
C-SPAN has occasionally produced [[spin-off (media)|spinoff]] programs from ''Booknotes'' focusing on specific topics. In 1994, ''Booknotes'' collaborated with Lincoln scholar [[Harold Holzer]] to produce a re-creation of the seven [[Lincoln<U+2013>Douglas debates of 1858|Lincoln<U+2013>Douglas debates]].<ref name=Rust>{{cite news |title=Americans Speak Up on Talk TV |author=Michael Rust |newspaper=Insight on the News |date=9 February 1998}}</ref> Several years later, a similar series retraced the journey of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] described in ''[[Democracy in America]]''.<ref name=Prial>{{cite news |title=After Many Million Pages, 'Booknotes' Ends Its Run |author=Frank J.

In 2008 to 2009, as part of programming specially commissioned for the 200th birthday of [[Abraham Lincoln]], C-SPAN produced a series titled ''Lincoln 200 Years'', which featured episodes on a variety of topics relating to the life of Lincoln including his career, his homes and his views on slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/lincoln200years/video/?title=cspan |title=Lincoln 200 Years |date= |work=C-SPAN.org |accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Run up to Lincoln's Thursday 200th Birthday celebration: C-SPAN Lincoln specials |first=Lynn |last=Sweet |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/02/run_up_to_lincolns_thursday_20.html |newspaper=Chicago Sun Times |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref>

The network has also produced special feature documentaries on American institutions and historical landmarks, exploring their historical background through to the present day.

Prior to the launch of the C-SPAN Video Library, websites such as [[Metavid]] and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records. However C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid's removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Democratizing_the_Archive:_An_Open_Interface_for_Mediation#Motivations_for_Metavid_and_its_Contested_Legality |title=Democratizing the Archive: An Open Interface for Mediation |publisher=Metavid|accessdate=12 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080605053154/http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Democratizing_the_Archive:_An_Open_Interface_for_Mediation#Motivations_for_Metavid_and_its_Contested_Legality |archivedate =5 June 2008}}</ref> C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|Stephen Colbert's performance]] at the [[White_House_Correspondents%27_Association#WHCA_Dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] from [[YouTube]].

==Organization and operations==
C-SPAN is operated by the National Cable Satellite Corporation, a [[non-profit organization]]<ref name=Wallace/> whose board of directors consists primarily of representatives of the largest [[cable television|cable companies]].<ref name=AboutCompany>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/about/company/index.asp?code=MISSION |title=Company/Corporate Information |author= |date= |work=C-SPAN.org |publisher= |accessdate=22 March 2011}}</ref> Early chairmen of C-SPAN include [[Bob Rosencrans]], [[John Saeman]], [[Ed Allen (businessman)|Ed Allen]] and [[Gene Schneider]].<ref name=AboutBoard>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.c-span.org/about/company/index.asp?code=BOARD |title=The Board |author= |date= |work=C-SPAN.org |publisher= |accessdate=7 December 2010}}</ref> Funding for C-SPAN does not come from advertising; instead, it receives nearly all of its funding from subscriber fees charged to cable and [[Direct-broadcast satellite]] (DBS) operators.<ref name=AboutCompany/> As the network is an independent entity, neither the cable industry nor Congress has power over the content of its programming.<ref name="Gillespie"/>

{{As of|2010|6}}, the network has more than 225 full and part-time employees.

==Audience==
There are no official viewing figures for C-SPAN because the network, which carries no commercials or underwriting spots, does not use the [[Nielsen ratings]],<ref name=Harden/> however there have been a number of surveys providing estimated figures. A 1994 survey found that 8.6% of the U.S. population regularly watched C-SPAN.<ref name=Harden/> Ten years later this figure had increased to 12% of the U.S. population, according to a Pew Research Center survey, while 31% of the population was categorized as occasional viewers.<ref name=Marcus/> {{As of|2004}}, over 28 million people said they watched C-SPAN programming each week.<ref name=Wallace/> A March 2009 Hart Research survey found that 20 percent of homes with cable TV watch C-SPAN at least once a week, for an estimated 39 million Americans.
