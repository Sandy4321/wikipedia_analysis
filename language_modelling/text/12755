'''Trafford Park''' is an area of the [[Trafford|Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England. Located opposite [[Salford Quays]], on the southern side of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], it is {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} west-southwest of [[Manchester city centre]], and {{convert|1.3|mi|km|1}} north of [[Stretford]]. Until the late 19th century it was the ancestral home of the [[Trafford (surname)|Trafford]] family, who sold it to entrepreneur Ernest Terah Hooley in 1896. Occupying an area of {{convert|4.7|mi2}}, it was the first planned [[Industrial park|industrial estate]] in the world,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=xiii}}</ref> and remains the largest in Europe.<ref name=MasterPlan/>

Trafford Park is almost entirely surrounded by water. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal, which opened in 1894, its northeastern and northwestern boundaries. Hooley's plan was to develop the Ship Canal frontage, but the canal was slow to generate the predicted volume of traffic, therefore in the early days the park was largely used for leisure activities such as golf, polo, and boating. [[British Westinghouse]] was the first major company to move in; by 1903 it was employing about half of the 12,000&nbsp;workers then employed in the park, and for almost 100&nbsp;years it remained one of the most important engineering facilities in Britain.

Trafford Park was a major supplier of [[materiel]] during the First and Second World Wars, producing the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines used to power both the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]]. At its peak in 1945, an estimated 75,000&nbsp;workers were employed in the park. That number began to decline during the 1960s as companies closed in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere. By 1967 employment had fallen to 50,000, and the decline continued throughout the 1970s. The new generation of container ships was too large for the Manchester Ship Canal, which led to a further decline in Trafford Park's fortunes. The workforce had fallen to 15,000 by 1976, and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared from the park.

The Trafford Park Urban Development Corporation, formed in 1987, reversed the estate's decline. In the 11&nbsp;years of its existence the park attracted 1,000&nbsp;companies, generating 28,299&nbsp;new jobs and <U+00A3>1.759&nbsp;billion of private sector investment. As of 2008, there were 1,400&nbsp;companies within Trafford Park, employing an estimated 35,000&nbsp;people.

==History==
===Pre-industrial===
Until the industrial development of the park began in the late 19th century, much of the area now known as Trafford Park was a "beautifully timbered deer park".<ref name=NichollsP3>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=3}}</ref>  Its {{convert|1183|acre|m2}} comprised flat meadows and grassland, and an inner park containing a tree-lined avenue leading from an entrance lodge at [[Barton-upon-Irwell]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=66<U+2013>67}}</ref>  It was the ancestral estate of the [[Trafford (surname)|de Trafford family]], one of the most ancient in England,<ref>{{citation |last=Thorber |first=Craig |title=The Trafford Family |publisher=Cheshire Antiquities |url=http://www.thornber.net/cheshire/htmlfiles/trafford.html | accessdate = 6&nbsp;February 2008}}</ref> and then one of the largest landowners in Stretford.  The family acquired the lands around Trafford in about 1200, when Richard de Trafford was given the lordship of Stretford by [[Hamon de Massey]], 4th Baron of Dunham.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masterson|Cliff|2002|pp=65<U+2013>66}}</ref>  Some time between 1672 and 1720, the de Traffords moved from the home they had occupied since 1017, in what is now known as [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester|Old Trafford]], to what was then called Whittleswick Hall, which they renamed Trafford Hall.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=9}}</ref> Their new home was a little to the east of where Tenax Circle is now, at the northwestern end of Trafford Park Road.

Trafford Park contained the hall, its grounds, and three farms: Park Farm, Moss Farm, and Waters Meeting Farm.<ref>{{citation |title=Park House Farm, Trafford Park |publisher=Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council |url=http://www.canalarchive.org.uk/stories/getobjectstory.php?rnum=T1433&enum=TE128&pnum=1&maxp=9 | year = 1896 | accessdate = 20&nbsp;July 2008}}</ref> From the original three entrance lodges to the park, at Throstle Nest, Barton-upon-Irwell and [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester|Old Trafford]], only the latter has survived, having been relocated from its original position opposite what is today the White City retail park to become the entrance to Gorse Hill Park.

[[File:Trafford park old entrance lodge.jpg|right|thumb|The Old Trafford entrance lodge and gates to Trafford Park were moved to their present site at the entrance to [[Gorse Hill]] Park in 1921.<ref>{{Harvnb|Newton|1998|p=5}}</ref>]]
In 1761, a section of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] was built along the southeast and southwest sides of Trafford Park. The canal along with the River Irwell, which marked the estate's northeast and northwest boundaries, gave the park its present-day "island-like" quality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=10}}</ref> In about 1860, an {{convert|8|acre|m2|sing=on}} ornamental lake was dug in the north of the park, close to the River Irwell.

A meeting held in 1882 at the [[Didsbury]] home of engineer [[Daniel Adamson]] began the estate's transformation, with the creation of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] committee. [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford]] was an implacable opponent of the proposed canal,<ref>{{citation |title=The Arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal |publisher=The Transport Archive |url=http://www.canalarchive.org.uk/stories/pages.php?enum=TE128&pnum=2&maxp=9 | accessdate = 5&nbsp;August 2008}}</ref> objecting that, amongst other things, it would bring polluted water close to his residence, interfere with his drainage, and render Trafford Hall uninhabitable, forcing him to "give up his home and leave the place". Despite Sir Humphrey's opposition the Ship Canal Bill became law on its third passage through Parliament, on 6&nbsp;August 1885.  Construction began in 1888, more than two years after Sir Humphrey's death,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=13}}</ref> although a nine foot high wall was built between the canal and the park, so as to block it off from view.  Two wharves were also built, for the exclusive use of the de Traffords.<ref>{{Harvnb|Masterson|Cliff|2002|p=68}}</ref>

The opening of the ship canal in 1894 made Trafford Park a prime site for industrial development.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=23<U+2013>24}}</ref> During the following century, the park was built over with factories and some housing for workers. The deer were initially allowed to continue roaming free, but as the park's industrialisation gathered pace they were considered inappropriate and were killed, the last of them in 1900.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=42}}</ref> Trafford Hall survived until its demolition following the Second World War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=99}}</ref>

===Early development===
On 7&nbsp;May 1896, [[Sir Humphrey de Trafford, 3rd Baronet|Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford]] put the {{convert|1183|acre|m2|adj=on}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Woodroofe | first = Fletcher A. | title = Manchester Ship Canal: the economic results of the Ship Canal on Manchester and the surrounding district | page = 37 | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/60241154 | publisher = LSE Selected Pamphlets, hosted at jstor.org | year = 1899}}</ref> estate up for auction, but it failed to reach its reported reserve price of <U+00A3>300,000 (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|300000|1896|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{#tag:ref|Comparing relative [[purchasing power]] of <U+00A3>300,000 in 1896 with 2008.|group="nb"}}<ref name=MeasuringWorth>{{citation |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present |publisher=MeasuringWorth |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/index.php |year=2009 |accessdate=3&nbsp;December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=16}}</ref> There was much public debate, before and after the abortive sale, as to whether Manchester Corporation ought to buy Trafford Park, but the corporation could not agree terms quickly enough, and so on 23&nbsp;June Ernest Terah Hooley became the new owner of Trafford Park, for the sum of <U+00A3>360,000 (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|360000|1896|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{#tag:ref|Comparing relative [[purchasing power]] of <U+00A3>360,000 in 1896 with 2008.|group="nb"}}<ref name=MeasuringWorth>{{citation |last=Officer |first=Lawrence H. |title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1264 to Present |publisher=MeasuringWorth |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/index.php |year=2009 |accessdate=3&nbsp;December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=22}}</ref>

On 17 August, Hooley formed Trafford Park Estates Ltd, transferring his ownership of the park to the new company&nbsp;<U+2013> of which he was the chairman and a significant shareholder&nbsp;<U+2013> at a substantial profit. The initial plans for the estate included a [[racetrack]], exclusive housing and a cycle works, along with the development of the ship canal frontage for "all types of trade including timber". By that time the ship canal had been open for two years, but the predicted traffic had yet to materialise. Hooley met with [[Marshall Stevens]], the general manager of the Ship Canal Company, and both men recognised the benefit that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to the ship canal, and the ship canal to the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=24}}</ref> He remained with the company, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director, until 1930.<ref name=NichollsP112>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=112}}</ref>

[[File:Salford docks 1924.jpg|thumb|left|220px|1924 map showing Trafford Park almost entirely enclosed by the Manchester Ship Canal and the Bridgewater Canal]]
The company initially chose not to construct buildings for letting, but instead to lease land for development. However, by the end of June 1897 less than 1&nbsp;percent of the park had been leased,<ref name="Nevell131">{{Harvnb|Nevell|1997|p=131}}</ref> and so the park's existing assets were put to use until more tenants could be found. Trafford Hall was opened as a hotel in 1899, to serve prospective industrialists considering a move to the park, along with their key employees. It had 40&nbsp;bedrooms, available to "Gentlemen only".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=29,&nbsp;42}}</ref> The hall's stables and some other outbuildings were used for stock auctions and the sale of horses, from 1900<U+2013>1902,<ref name=FarnieP128>{{Harvnb|Farnie|1980|p=128}}</ref> and the ornamental lake was leased to William Crooke and Sons, for use as a boating lake, initially on a five-year lease.<ref name=NichollsPP28-29>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=28<U+2013>29}}</ref> A [[polo]] ground was set up in the park in 1902,<ref name=FarnieP128 /> and {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land near the hall were leased to the Manchester Golf Club, who laid out a three-mile (4.8&nbsp;km) long course. The club moved from Trafford Park to a new site at Hopwood Park in 1912.<ref>{{citation |title=History |publisher=The Manchester Golf Club |url=http://www.mangc.co.uk/history.htm | accessdate = 8&nbsp;August 2008}}</ref> All of the open-field land uses were subsequently pushed out by industry.

In 1908 the Estates Company decided to reverse its earlier policy of only leasing the land, and began to construct what were known as "Hives", {{convert|25|ft|adj=on}} wide subdivisions of a longer single building that could be internally reconfigured for each tenant's needs. A series of 19 were built initially, available to rent at <U+00A3>80 per annum (<U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|80|1908|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} [[Brooke Bond]] was one of the companies that took advantage of the Hives, before moving to its purpose-built factory on the park in 1922. The Estates Company also built large reinforced concrete warehouses, known as "Safes". These buildings were fitted with sprinkler systems and were considered fireproof, which reduced insurance costs to 25&nbsp;percent of those of comparable warehouses elsewhere in the area. Each Safe had a capacity of {{convert|778000|cuft}}, sufficient to hold 50,000&nbsp;bales of cotton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=54<U+2013>55}}</ref>

===Industrialisation===
Among the first industries to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power station in the park, on the banks of the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. Most of these early developments were built on the eastern side of the park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=32}}</ref>

The first American company to arrive was Westinghouse, which formed its British subsidiary <U+2013> [[British Westinghouse|British Westinghouse Electric Company]] <U+2013> in 1899, and purchased {{convert|130|acre|km2}} on two sites. Building work started in 1900, and the factory began production of turbines and electric generators in 1902. By the following year, British Westinghouse was employing about half of the 12,000&nbsp;workers in Trafford Park. Its main machine shop was {{convert|899|ft|m|0}} long and {{convert|440|ft|m|0}} wide; for almost&nbsp;100 years Westinghouse's Trafford Park works was the most important engineering facility in Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stratton|Trinder|1997|p=88}}</ref> In 1919, Westinghouse was sold to the Vickers Company and renamed [[Metropolitan-Vickers]], often shortened to Metrovicks.<ref>{{Harvnb|1996|p=75}}</ref>

In 1903, the [[Cooperative Wholesale Society]] (CWS), bought land at Trafford Wharf and set up a large food-packing factory and a flour mill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=56,&nbsp;135}}</ref> Other companies arriving at about the same time included Kilverts ([[lard]] manufacturers), the Liverpool Warehousing Company, and Lancashire Dynamo & Crypto Ltd.<ref name="Nicholls 1996 35">{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=35}}</ref>

[[File:Trafford park kelloggs bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Trafford Park's southern entrance is marked by this bridge connecting [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]] manufacturing plant to its warehouse. Kellogg's moved into the park during the 1930s.<ref name=NichollsP71>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=71}}</ref>]]
The second major American company to set up a manufacturing base in Trafford Park was the [[Ford Motor Company]], in 1911. Initially Ford used its factory as an assembly plant for the [[Model T]], although other vehicles were assembled there in later years, before moving to a new factory at [[Dagenham]], [[Essex]], in 1931.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=63<U+2013>65}}</ref> By 1915, 100&nbsp;American companies had moved into the park, peaking at over 200 by 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Farnie|1980|p=129}}</ref> When the cotton industry began to decline in the early 20th century, Trafford Park and the Manchester Ship Canal helped Manchester&nbsp;<U+2013> and to a lesser extent the rest of south Lancashire&nbsp;<U+2013> to weather the economic depression from which the rest of [[Lancashire]] suffered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kidd|1996|p=185}}</ref> During the First World War, the park was used for the manufacture of munitions, chemicals and other war materiel. Most firms at Trafford Park succeeded in avoiding bankruptcy during the [[Great Depression]], unlike the rest of Lancashire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kidd|1996|pp=185<U+2013>186}}</ref> Ford moved to Dagenham in 1931, but returned temporarily to Trafford Park during the Second World War.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=80,&nbsp;103}}</ref>

Metropolitan Vickers set up Manchester's and one of the UK's first radio stations at their factory in 1921. The station's first broadcast took place on 17&nbsp;May 1922. In October that year the company was one of six who formed the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Company]] (BBC), which started broadcasting from the Metrovicks studio under the call sign 2ZY on 15 November 1922. Much of the station's content was musical, but news, plays, and children's programmes were also transmitted. Conditions in the small {{convert|30|x|16|ft|adj=on}} studio were cramped, and the BBC moved the station to larger premises outside the park in 1923.<ref name=NicholsPP76-77>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=76<U+2013>77}}</ref>

===Westwards expansion===
Sir Humphrey de Trafford had retained {{convert|1300|acre}} of land on the western side of the ship canal after his 1897 sale of Trafford Park. Hemmed in as it was between the canals and "an increasingly urbanised Stretford to the east", as the industrialisation of the park neared its completion the Estates Company started to acquire parcels of the remaining de Trafford land, then in the control of family trustees, as did the Canal Company. In 1924 the Estates Company bought a half share in Dumplington Estates Ltd., a company set up to administer {{convert|38|acre}} of land bought from the de Trafford Trustees on which it was intended to build a garden village. In 1929 the Ship Canal Company acquired Dumplington Estates, and in return gave the Estates Company land to the south of Barton, the Trafford Park Extension. The Canal Company recognised the potential for a new dock on the land, giving the area its name of Barton Dock Estate, although no dock was ever built. The Barton Docks area was developed during and after the Second World War, but the land belonging to Dumplington Estates remained largely undeveloped until the construction of the [[Trafford Centre]], which opened in 1998.<ref name name=NichollsPP70-72>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=70<U+2013>72}}</ref>

===Second World War===
Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war [[materiel]] during the Second World War, such as the [[Avro Manchester]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers, and the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines used to power the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] and the Lancaster. The engines were made by Ford, under licence. The 17,316&nbsp;workers employed in Ford's purpose-built factory had produced 34,000&nbsp;engines by the war's end. The facility was designed in two separate sections to minimise the impact of bomb damage on production.<ref name="NichollsP103-104">{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=103<U+2013>104}}</ref> The wood-working factory of F. Hills & Sons built over 800&nbsp;[[Percival Proctor]] aircraft for the RAF between 1940 and 1945, which were flight tested at the nearby [[Barton Aerodrome]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|2004|p=227}}</ref> Other companies produced gun bearings, steel tracks for [[Churchill tank]]s, munitions, [[Bailey Bridge]]s, and much else. ICI built and operated the first facility in the UK able to produce [[penicillin]] in quantity.<ref name=NichollsP101>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=101}}</ref>

As an important industrial area, the park suffered from extensive bombing, particularly during the [[Manchester Blitz]] of December 1940. On the night of 23&nbsp;December 1940, the Metropolitan-Vickers aircraft factory in Mosley Road was badly damaged, with the loss of the first 13&nbsp;MV-built Avro Manchester bombers in final assembly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rowlinson|1947|p=56}}</ref> The new Ford factory producing aircraft engines was bombed only a few days after its opening in May 1941.<ref name="NichollsP103-104"/> Trafford Hall was severely damaged by bombing, and was demolished shortly after the war ended.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=99<U+2013>100}}</ref> At the outbreak of war in 1939 there were an estimated 50,000&nbsp;workers employed in the park. By the end of the war in 1945 that number had risen to 75,000,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nevell|1997|pp=130<U+2013>133}}</ref> probably the peak size of the park's workforce; Metropolitan-Vickers alone employed 26,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stratton|Trinder|1997|p=117}}</ref>

===Decline and regeneration===
[[File:Trafford park hook and chain.jpg|right|thumb|upright|One of a pair of {{convert|56|ft|adj=on}} high sculptures named ''Skyhooks'', at the eastern end of the park. They were designed by Brian Fell and installed in 1995, as part of the estate's regeneration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wyke|Cocks|2004|pp=400<U+2013>401}}</ref>]]
In the 1960s, employment in the park began to decline as companies closed their premises in favour of newer, more efficient plants elsewhere.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=118}}</ref> [[Ellesmere Port]] and [[Runcorn]] at the western end of the Manchester Ship Canal were in the ascendency industrially and they overtook Trafford Park in economic importance. In 1967, employment had fallen to 50,000 and there was a further decline in the 1970s.<ref name="Kidd186">{{Harvnb|Kidd|1996|p=186}}</ref> In 1971, Stretford Council responded by setting up the Trafford Park Industrial Council (TRAFIC), membership of which was open to any firm in Trafford Park. One of TRAFIC's early initiatives was to encourage businesses in the park to address the general air of decay, by improving their own areas through landscaping and other environmental improvements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=123}}</ref> The park's decline was exacerbated by the decreasing use of the Manchester Ship Canal during the 1970s, which was unable to accommodate the newer, larger container ships then entering service.<ref name="Kidd186"/> By 1976, the workforce had fallen to 15,000,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kidd|1996|p=187}}</ref> and by the 1980s industry had virtually disappeared.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kidd|1996|p=188}}</ref>

On 12&nbsp;August 1981, {{convert|483|acre|km2}} of Trafford Park <U+2013> along with [[Salford Quays]] <U+2013> were declared an [[Enterprise Zone]] by the UK government, in an attempt to encourage new development within the estate. The new status did little to reverse the park's fortunes however; during a 1984 [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate, [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Stretford]], [[Tony Lloyd]], described the area's decline as "spectacular and disastrous".<ref name=NichollsPP135-140>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=135<U+2013>140}}</ref> The target had been to create 7,000&nbsp;new jobs over 10&nbsp;years, but by 1986 only 2,557 had been created, not even enough to compensate for the ongoing job losses caused by closures within the park.<ref name=NichollsPP135-140 /> On 10&nbsp;February 1987 the [[Trafford Park Development Corporation]] was formed to assume responsibility for a {{convert|3130|acre|km2}} Urban Development Area that included not only Trafford Park but also parts of Stretford, Salford Quays, and the former steelworks at [[Irlam]], now known as Northbank.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=141,&nbsp;147}}</ref> Of the four redevelopment schemes undertaken by the corporation one, Wharfside, included {{convert|200|acre}} of the eastern end of the park as well as part of the ship canal docks and the area around [[Manchester United F.C.]]'s [[Old Trafford]] football ground to the east of the Bridgewater Canal. The intention was to build "a flagship site" containing prestigious accommodation for offices, shops, and "hi-tech" industries, capitalising on the area's proximity to Manchester city centre and mirroring the earlier success of the redevelopment at nearby Salford Quays.<ref name=NichollsPP147-151>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=147<U+2013>151}}</ref>

Between 1987 and 1998, the [[development corporation]] attracted 1,000&nbsp;companies, generating 28,299&nbsp;new jobs and <U+00A3>1.759&nbsp;billion of private sector investment.<ref name=MasterPlan>{{citation |title=Trafford Park Masterplan |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=DD1FBEE9-38F4-4024-B10C-C0515C48C2C4 |publisher=Trafford Council | date = October 2008 |accessdate=5&nbsp;July 2010}}</ref> The setting up of the corporation was intended to be only a temporary measure, terminating on 31&nbsp;March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=165}}</ref> The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/localgov/audit/inspection/reports/Pages/economicregeneration_03.aspx | date = July 2005 |title=Economic regeneration: Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council|publisher=Audit Commission | accessdate = 31&nbsp;August 2010}}</ref> As of 2008, there were 1,400&nbsp;companies within the park, employing an estimated 35,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=MasterPlan />

==Governance==
===Civic history===
The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of [[Stretford Urban District]]; the west was controlled by the urban district of [[Barton-upon-Irwell]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=49}}</ref> Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.<ref name="Nicholls 1996 35"/>

In 1901, Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford [[Urban district|UDC]], on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26&nbsp;percent between 1892 and 1895.<ref>{{Harvnb|Farnie|1980|p=11}}</ref> Stretford and [[Lancashire County Council]] opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry.<ref name=NichollsP59>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=59}}</ref> In 1969 [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] wrote: "That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England."<ref>{{Harvnb|Pevsner|1969|p=265}}</ref>

The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government [[Ward (politics)|ward]], Park Ward, was created within Stretford, However, the new ward did not include the western part of the park, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=60<U+2013>61}}</ref>

As a consequence of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the borough of Stretford was abolished and Trafford Park has, since 1&nbsp;April 1974, formed part of the [[Trafford|Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]].<ref>{{citation |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=Greater Manchester County Record Office |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/Guides/Gazeteer/gazzs.htm|at=Places names <U+2013> S}}</ref> As of 2010, the park is in the Trafford ward of Gorse Hill.<ref name=GorseHill>{{citation |title=Gorse Hill Ward Profile <U+2013> 2010/11 |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=181B1502-8B02-4FCB-A49F-BD2467F098F0 |publisher=Trafford Council |accessdate=12&nbsp;August 2010}}</ref>

===Political representation===
Since 1997, Trafford Park has been in the [[Stretford and Urmston (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Stretford and Urmston]]. [[Kate Green]], a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], became the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]], with a majority of 8,935, representing 48.6&nbsp;percent of the vote. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] took 28.7&nbsp;percent of the vote, the [[Liberal Democrats]] 16.9&nbsp;percent, the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] 3.4&nbsp;percent, the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] 2.0&nbsp;percent, and the [[Christian Party (UK)|Christian Party]] 0.4&nbsp;percent.<ref>{{citation |title=Stretford and Urmston |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/1347/stretford-and-urmston |accessdate=7&nbsp;April 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==
The [[topography]] of Trafford Park is either flat or gently undulating, about {{convert|144|ft|m|0}} above sea level at its highest point.<ref>{{citation |title=Trafford Park, United Kingdom |work=Global Gazetteer, Version 2.1 |publisher=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/UK/00/Trafford_Park.html | accessdate = 2&nbsp;July 2007}}</ref> The local bedrock is [[Bunter (geology)|Triassic Bunter Sandstone]], overlaid by sand and gravel deposited during the last [[ice age]], around 10,000&nbsp;years ago. There are some areas of [[bog|peat bog]] in the west of the park, in the area formerly known as Trafford Moss.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nevell|1997|pp=xii,&nbsp;3}}</ref> In 1793, [[William Roscoe]] began work on reclaiming the bog, and by 1798 that work was sufficiently advanced for him to turn his attention to the task of reclaiming the much larger [[Chat Moss]] in nearby Salford, also owned by the Trafford family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1985|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref>

The park occupies an area of {{convert|4.7|mi2}},<ref name=MasterPlan /> and is almost entirely surrounded by water. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] forms its southeastern and southwestern boundaries, and the Manchester Ship Canal forms its northeastern and northwestern boundaries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=1}}</ref> Trafford Park is the most northerly area of Trafford,<ref name=GorseHill /> and faces [[City of Salford|Salford]] across the Manchester Ship Canal. Stretford lies to the south and east, and [[Urmston]] to the west.

==Trafford Park Village==

In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200&nbsp;houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as "The Village".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=38<U+2013>40}}</ref> The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 over 500&nbsp;houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060.<ref name=NichollsP40>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=40}}</ref> The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north<U+2013>south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east<U+2013>west.

[[File:St anthonys church trafford park.jpg|thumb|left|St Antony of Padua, built in 1904 and reclad in 1994<ref name=Cube>{{citation |last=Griffin |first=Phil |title=St Anthony's Roman Catholic Church|url=http://www.cube.org.uk/thecity/archisnap_detail.asp?id=84 |publisher=Centre for the Urban Built Environment |accessdate=11&nbsp;August 2010}}</ref>|alt=photograph]]
The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nevell|1997|p=133}}</ref> Three [[tin tabernacle|corrugated iron churches]] were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts ([[Church of England]]) in 1902, and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] St Antony's in 1904.<ref name=NichollsP40/> St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982.<ref>{{citation |title=St Cuthbert |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Stretford/StCuthbert.shtml |publisher=GENUKI |accessdate=11&nbsp;August 2010}}</ref> Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford.<ref name=Nicholls>{{Harvnb|1996|p=150}}</ref> The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as [[slum]]s in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298&nbsp;houses were demolished. A further 325&nbsp;houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84&nbsp;houses remaining.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=130<U+2013>132}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[Image:ImperialWarMuseumNorth02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The main entrance to the Imperial War Museum North]]
The [[Imperial War Museum North]], opened on 5&nbsp;July 2002, is in Trafford Wharf, on the southern edge of the ship canal looking over towards [[Salford Quays]]. An example of [[Deconstructivism|deconstructivist architecture]], it was the first building in the United Kingdom to be designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]]. The structure consists of three interlocking sections: the air shard, the earth shard, and the water shard, representing a world torn apart by conflict. Entrance to the museum is via the air shard, which is {{convert|180|ft|m|0}} in height, and is open to the elements. It has a viewing platform about {{convert|95|ft}} high, offering views across [[City of Salford|Salford]] and the Quays towards Manchester city centre. The museum houses two extensive exhibition spaces. The largest is dedicated to the permanent exhibition covering conflicts from 1900 to the present day, and the other space is used for special exhibitions.<ref>{{citation |title=About the Building and its Architect |url=http://north.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.993 |publisher=Imperial War Museum North | accessdate = 1&nbsp;August 2008}}</ref>

'''Trafford Ecology Park'''
[[File:Trafford ecology park.jpg|thumb|left|What remains of Trafford Park's boating lake, now the Trafford Ecology Park]]
The {{convert|11|acre|m2|adj=on}} Trafford Ecology Park is what remains of Trafford Park's ornamental boating lake. Boating continued on the lake until the 1930s, but by then its water had become polluted by asbestos and oil seepage from the neighbouring Anglo American Oil depot. During the Second World War the site was used as a tip for foundry waste. [[Esso]] bought the land in 1974, and levelled and partly seeded it, to improve the frontage to its own site. Trafford council bought the land from Esso in 1983, for <U+00A3>50,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1983|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{#tag:ref|Comparing relative [[purchasing power]] of <U+00A3>50,000 in 1983 with 2008.|group="nb"}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Government spending restrictions delayed the park's restoration and conversion, and it was not fully opened to the public until 1990.<ref name="NichollsPP143-147">{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=143<U+2013>147}}</ref>

The present lake is about one-third of its original size, but although now relatively small it supports a wide variety of wildlife, including foxes, weasels, rabbits, hedgehogs, lapwings, kestrels, herons, coot, Canada Geese, and several varieties of newt.<ref name="NichollsPP143-147" /> In 2007 the park was designated a [[Local Nature Reserve]], one of only two in Trafford.<ref>{{citation |title=Ecology park wins accolade |date=12&nbsp;January2007 |work=This is Cheshire |publisher=Newsquest Media Group |url=http://archive.thisischeshire.co.uk/2007/1/12/283162.html | accessdate = 8&nbsp;May 2008}}</ref>

==Transport==
At the end of the 19th century there were no public transport routes in, and few running close to, Trafford Park. Its size meant that the Estates Company was obliged to provide some means of travelling around the park, and so a gas-powered [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]] was commissioned, intended to carry both people and freight. The first tram ran on 23&nbsp;July 1897, but after a few days of operation there was an accident in which a tramcar was derailed, and the service was suspended until the following year.<ref name=StartOfANewEra/> The tram's maximum speed was {{convert|12|mph}}, and their distinctive exhaust smell quickly earned them the nickname "Lamp Oil Express". The service was operated by the Gas Traction Company, which paid a share of its takings to the Estates Company, but receipts were so low that by 1899 the Gas Traction Company was in serious financial difficulty, and entered voluntary liquidation. Salford Corporation then refused to provide any more gas for the trams, and the service was once again suspended until the Estates Company bought the entire operation for <U+00A3>2,000 in 1900.<ref name=NichollsP34>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=34}}</ref> A separate electric tramway was installed in 1903, and was taken over and operated by Manchester and Salford Corporations in 1905.<ref name=NichollsP47>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=47}}</ref> The takeover did not affect the gas trams however, which continued to run until 1908, when they were replaced by steam locomotives.<ref name=StartOfANewEra/> Between 1904 and 1907 the Estates Company also operated a horse-drawn bus for the use of "gentlemen" staying at Trafford Hall, then a hotel. The service, available 24-hours a day, was replaced by a motor car in 1907.<ref name=NichollsP48>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=48}}</ref>

[[File:Trafford park railway.jpg|right|thumb|Trafford Park's railway system was closed in 1998, although much of its infrastructure remains.]]
Under an 1898 agreement between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and to the construction of a permanent connection between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track.<ref name=NichollsP36>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=36}}</ref> In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, as a result of the Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament.<ref name=StartOfANewEra>{{citation |title=The Start of a New Era |publisher=The Transport Archive |url=http://www.canalarchive.org.uk/stories/pages.php?enum=TE128&pnum=5&maxp=9 | accessdate = 8&nbsp;August 2007}}</ref> The network was also connected to the [[Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway]] near Cornbrook.<ref name="Nevell131"/> At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26&nbsp;route miles (42&nbsp;km), handling about 2.5&nbsp;million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|2004|p=84}}</ref> The Trafford Park Euroterminal rail freight terminal, which has the capacity to deal with 100,000 containers a year, was opened in 1993, at a cost of <U+00A3>11&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|p=161}}</ref>

[[Trafford Park Aerodrome (Manchester)|Trafford Park Aerodrome]] was Manchester's first purpose-built airfield, laid out on a site between Trafford Park Road, Mosley Road, and Ashburton Road.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|2004|p=212}}</ref> The first aircraft landed there on 7&nbsp;July 1911, flown from [[Liverpool]] by Henry G. Melly.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hayes|1994|p=26}}</ref> The aerodrome was in use until the early years of the First World War, and possibly until 1918,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholls|1996|pp=61<U+2013>63}}</ref> when it was replaced by the newly completed [[Alexandra Park Aerodrome]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|2004|p=214}}</ref>
