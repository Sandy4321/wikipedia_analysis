'''''Slay Tracks (1933-1969)''''' (also referred to as '''''Slay Tracks''''') is the debut [[extended play]] by the [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] band [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]. Pavement, then consisting of founding members [[Stephen Malkmus]] ([[rhythm guitar|guitar]], [[vocalist|vocals]]) and [[Scott Kannberg]] ([[lead guitar|guitar]]), recorded ''Slay Tracks'' with [[Record producer|producer]] and future member [[Gary Young]] ([[drummer|drums]]) during a four hour session. The EP was released as a [[Gramophone record#Common formats|7"]] vinyl record on the band's own [[record label]] Treble Kicker in 1989. The music in ''Slay Tracks'' is influenced by indie and [[punk rock]] bands, including [[Swell Maps]] and [[The Fall]], and many of the lyrics are inspired by life in the band's hometown of [[Stockton, California]].

Although only 1000 copies of ''Slay Tracks'' were pressed, the EP became an underground hit, largely due to a cover of its second track, "Box Elder", by [[England|English]] band [[The Wedding Present]]. It was met with generally positive reviews from critics, though most of its initial reviews were from independently produced [[zine]]s. The songs on ''Slay Tracks'' would later appear on the 1993 compilation ''[[Westing (By Musket & Sextant)]]'', reaching a wider audience than the EP's limited initial release. The release of ''Slay Tracks'' was significant to Pavement's signing to [[Drag City]] Records, and later to [[Matador Records]]. 

==Background and recording==
Pavement was formed in 1989 in [[Stockton, California]] by [[Steve Malkmus]] and [[Scott Kannberg]]. Malkmus and Kannberg had previously performed together in the band Bag O' Bones.<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 41</ref> Pavement had its start playing at [[open mike]] nights at clubs and bars.<ref name="p. 61" /> The songs the band played during this time were mostly [[Cover version|covers]], although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on ''Slay Tracks''.<ref name="p. 61" /> Malkmus recalls, "It was pretty reasonable to be able to make a single for [[United States dollar|$]]1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band."<ref name="p. 61">Jovanovic (2004). p. 61</ref> Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally-minded of which was [[Gary Young]]'s Louder Than You Think Studio.<ref name="p. 63" /> The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities.<ref name="p. 63">Jovanovic (2004). p. 63</ref> Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record ''Slay Tracks''.<ref>"[http://www.matadorrecords.com/preston_school_of_industry/biography.html Preston School of Industry Biography]". [[Matador Records]], [[August 28]], [[2001]]. Retrieved on [[December 17]], [[2007]].</ref>

''Slay Tracks'' was recorded during a four hour session on [[January 17]], [[1989]] at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing the studio and the recording process, said, "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big [[cannabis (drug)|pot]] plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top."<ref name="p. 65" /> Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, "[Malkmus and Kannberg] come in and they play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'"<ref name="p. 66">Jovanovic (2004). p. 66</ref> Kannberg said, "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it."<ref name="p. 66" /> The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the [[pseudonym]]s S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.<ref name="p. 65" />

==Release==
After recording was completed Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus had left on a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various [[independent label]]s, distributors, and [[zine]]s. He recalled "I had no idea how to do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like [[SST Records|SST]] and [[Twin/Tone Records|Twin Tone]] and ask, 'How do I do this?'"<ref name="p. 67">Jovanovic (2004). p. 67</ref> It was recommended to Kannberg by a representative from SST to use Erica Records, a [[Los Angeles]] 7" manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of ''Slay Tracks''; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the [[Audio mastering|master]] recording produced by the company: "It sounds like it sounds now<U+2014>it's just a mess<U+2014>but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, if it sounds like that<U+2013>whatever.'"<ref name="p. 67" /> 1000 copies of ''Slay Tracks'' were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label.<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 208</ref> The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the [[United States]] and [[England]], although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting [[Austria]].<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 71</ref>

''Slay Tracks'' found unexpected attention after the [[Leeds]], [[England]]-based band [[The Wedding Present]] covered "Box Elder" on their own 1990 EP, ''Brassneck''. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to ''Slay Tracks'' by future Pavement bassist [[Mark Ibold]] while visiting [[New York City]].<ref name="p. 73">Jovanovic (2004). p. 73</ref> The Wedding Present cover is different from the original in that the line "that I had to get the fuck out of this town" was changed to "that I had to get right out of this town".<ref name="p. 74">Jovanovic (2004). p. 74</ref> The "Box Elder" cover received radio airplay from influential English [[disc jockey]] [[John Peel]], which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement.<ref name="p. 73" /> Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended."<ref name="p. 73" /> However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that."<ref name="p. 73" />

Shortly after its release, ''Slay Tracks'' became a [[Record collecting|collector's]] item.<ref name="p. 72">Jovanovic (2004) p. 72</ref> According to an April 1990 [[Drag City]] Records press release, copies were typically sold for $500-$600.<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 79</ref> Malkmus and Kannberg each kept 100 copies of the EP, and Malkmus said "I used to sell them for fifty dollars. When I needed money I'd go in and sell a couple to the store and they'd sell for a hundred dollars each. I rarely meet anyone who bought it when it originally came out."<ref name="p. 72" /> Malkmus also said that the pair "probably gave away about one-hundred to friends and bands we later toured with."<ref name="p. 72" /> The songs on ''Slay Tracks'' found [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]] on several [[college radio]] stations, including [[University of Virginia]]'s [[WTJU]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[KALX]].<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 54<U+2013>57.</ref> Kannberg commented on the EP's unanticipated popularity, saying "It was very surprising to find that people were into [''Slay Tracks'']."<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 76</ref>

==Reception==
''Slay Tracks'' received generally positive reviews. Much of the initial critical reception to ''Slay Tracks'' was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the [[San Francisco, California]]-based zine ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' said "Most of the tunes work by virtue of their eclecticism, freshness, and originality<U+2014>this is a good one."<ref name="p. 70">Jovanovic (2004). p. 70</ref> The zine ''Conflict'' called the EP "absolutely perfect."<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 68</ref> ''Slay Tracks'' also received attention from mainstream publications. [[Robert Christgau]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]'' rated ''Slay Tracks'' an A-,<ref>Christgau, Robert. "[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv291-91.php Consumer Guide Feb. 26, 1991]".

Retrieved on [[October 22]], [[2007]].</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review said: "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. .... What a party!"<ref name="p. 69">Jovanovic (2004). p. 69</ref> A reviewer for ''[[Option (music magazine)|Option]]'' praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP "loose and intentionally lo-fi," and saying "let's hope this Pavement says cracked."<ref name="p. 69" /> ''[[College Music Journal]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> review was also favorable, noting "You're Killing Me" and "She Believes" as highlights, and calling the EP a "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive {{sic}} melodic balance, and whether that is in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential."<ref name="p. 70" />

==Legacy==
Young's drum performance on ''Slay Tracks'' eventually lead to his joining of Pavement as a full-time member. Young produced the group's 1990 EP ''[[Demolition Plot J-7]]'', but displayed hostility toward then-current drummer Jason Fawkes.<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 78</ref> Fawkes left Pavement in 1991 due to animosity with Malkmus, allowing Young to drum on their third EP, ''[[Perfect Sound Forever (EP)|Perfect Sound Forever]]''.<ref>Jovanovic (2004). p. 82</ref> Young drummed on all Pavement releases from then on until 1992's ''[[Watery, Domestic]]'', after which he was fired for his increasingly erratic behavior and was replaced with [[Steve West]]. Young's drumming on ''Slay Tracks'' was later recognized as an important turning point in Pavement's history, and was considered to be "the opportunity of a lifetime" by C. Harris-Nystrom of the ''[[News & Review]]''.<ref>Harris-Nystrom, C. "[http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Content?oid=oid%3A30311 Outsider art]". ''[[News & Review]]'', [[May 6]], [[2004]].

Dan Koretzky, founder of [[Drag City]] Records, ordered 200 copies of the EP for the [[Chicago]] Reckless Records store he worked for at the time.<ref name="p. 73" /> Koretzky asked Kannberg if he would sign to Drag City during the same phone call that he ordered the EP.<ref name="p. 73" /> Kannberg remembered expressing reluctance to sign to any label, but Drag City producer and session musician [[Rian Murphy]] recalled that "We asked, they said yes. Lives didn't seem to be on the line."<ref name="p. 73" /> Chris Lombardi and Gerald Cosloy of [[Matador Records]] also first heard of Pavement after Kannberg sent a copy of ''Slay Tracks'' to their zine, ''Conflict''.<ref name="p. 95">Jovanovic (2004). p. 95</ref> Matador signed Pavement in 1992 for the release of their debut studio album, ''[[Slanted and Enchanted]]''.

The songs on ''Slay Tracks'' are all included on the 1993 compilation ''[[Westing (By Musket & Sextant)]]'', along with several of Pavement's other early material.
