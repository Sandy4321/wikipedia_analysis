'''Tool''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[Band (music)|band]], formed during 1990 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], that consists of drummer [[Danny Carey]], bassist [[Justin Chancellor]], guitarist [[Adam Jones]], and vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]].

== History ==
=== Early years (1990<U+2013>1992) ===
During the 1980s, the future members of Tool had all moved to Los Angeles. Both [[Paul d'Amour]] and [[Adam Jones]] wanted to enter the film industry, while [[Maynard James Keenan]] studied arts and later worked applying spatial design concepts to remodeling pet stores.<ref name="livewire"/> [[Danny Carey]] performed as a drummer for [[Green Jell<U+00FF>]],<ref>{{cite web | title= Cereal Killer | publisher=imdb.com | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355502/ | accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> was a studio drummer for [[Carole King]], and played around Los Angeles with [[Pigmy Love Circus]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Tool Bio: Danny Carey | publisher =Toolband.com | url =http://www.toolband.com/identity/danny/main.html | accessdate =2007-05-08 }}</ref>

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend and started [[jam session|jamming]] together around the end of the decade. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by [[Tom Morello]], an old high school friend of Jones and former bandmate of [[Electric Sheep (band)|Electric Sheep]].<ref>{{cite book

=== ''Undertow'' (1993<U+2013>1995) ===

[[Image:Screenshot tool sober lollapalooza 93 mtv clip.jpg|thumb|right|Tool's [[Lollapalooza]] 1993 performance was an important step in boosting their popularity. Above the band performs "[[Sober (song)|Sober]]". Left to right: Jones, Keenan, Carey.]]
The following year, Tool was able to release their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993), because many of the songs on ''Undertow'' had already been written at the time ''Opiate'' was released.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/> The band began touring again as planned, with a memorable exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play the Garden Pavilion in [[Hollywood]], but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Church of Scientology]], which clashes with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being."<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> Keenan recalled that he "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."<ref name="33 things">{{cite web | url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=2002 | title=33 Things You Should Know About Tool | work=Blender | accessdate=2006-09-18 | author=Jon Dolan | year=2006 | month=August }}</ref> 

After several successful concerts on the second stage during the [[Lollapalooza]] road show later that year, Tool was offered the chance to play on the main stage due to their "presence, prowess and power."<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"/> On Lollapalooza's last night, a hometown concert in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Tool was introduced by [[Bill Hicks]], who had become a friend and important influence on the band after being mentioned in ''Undertow'''s liner notes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=April_1997--High_Times.html | title=Hard rockers hail comic genius Bill Hicks.

Rather than miss out on a large audience, Tool decided to censor itself and released a plain white album cover that contained nothing more than a giant bar code, the band's name, and the album tracks. }}</ref> The single "[[Sober (song)|Sober]]" continued to go strong as well, closing in on becoming a hit single by March 1994,<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/> and winning the band first awards for the accompanying music video, such as Billboard's "Best Video By A New Artist".<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/>

With the release of Tool's follow-up to "Sober", "[[Prison Sex (Tool song)|Prison Sex]]", the band again became the target of censorship. Due to the symbolic portrayal of [[child abuse]], the American branch of [[MuchMusic]] called the band into question by deeming the respective music video &mdash; like "Sober" mainly created by guitarist Adam Jones &mdash; too graphic and offensive,<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows" /> and [[MTV]] stopped airing the video after a few viewings.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/text/sfc.nov.94.html | title=A Tool for the Truly Cool - Big hit of Lollapalooza tour gears up for second album | accessdate=2006-03-02 | year=1994 | work=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Still, ''Undertow'' was certified platinum in September 1994.<ref>{{cite web | title =Tool Timeline | publisher =Rock On The Net | url =http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-t/tool.htm | accessdate =2007-05-09}}</ref>

[[Image:Tool aenima cover dedication to hicks.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This version of the ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' artwork shows a dedication to satirist [[Bill Hicks]], "another dead hero."]]
After Justin Chancellor came on board, recording of the already-begun ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' continued. The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''<U+00C6>nima'''s (later Grammy-nominated) artwork. The album was released in October 1996, and displayed influences of other artists as well:

[[Satire|Satirist]] [[Bill Hicks]] had long been an inspiration for the band and is noted as such in the liner notes of ''Undertow''. Two-and-a-half years prior to the release of ''<U+00C6>nima'' Bill Hicks died, and the album is dedicated to his memory.<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"/> The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks' material and ideas, because they felt that they "were resonating similar concepts. Unity is the philosophical center. Evolution. Change."<ref name="austinkeenanhicks">{{cite web

| quote = The late, Austin-based comedian gets big play on Aenima: several of his routines are sampled, there's a painting of him in the CD booklet titled Another Dead Hero, and the disc's back cover inlay depicts Hicks' California-in-the-ocean "Arizona Bay" theory. Keenan says Aenima is not a tribute to Hicks, he's fully aware what kind of exposure this highly anticipated album should give the late comedian. [...] "I think that's what he really liked about us as well -- that we were resonating similar concepts. Unity is the philosophical center. Evolution. Change. Internally and externally. Individually and globally. That's pretty much the gist of his comedy no matter what he was talking about -- music, porno, smoking." [...] Still, the most obvious connection are the Hicks' samples that end Aenima's title cut and segue into the album-closing, "Third Eye," a song about the government's war on drugs.

To support the album, the band released "[[Stinkfist]]" as a first single. Yet it had difficulty gaining airplay, and it was shortened by radio programmers. Additionally, MTV renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track #1" due to offensive connotations,<ref name="stinkfist" /> and the lyrics of the song were altered.<ref>{{cite book

A tour began as well, in October 1996, only two weeks after ''<U+00C6>nima'''s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia in late March 1997. April 1 saw the first of several [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] pranks related with the band, most of them being initiated by Kabir Akhtar, webmaster of the semi-official fanpage [http://toolshed.down.net t.d.n.], announcing that:
<blockquote>"...while on tour in Australia, Tool's tour bus was involved in a serious highway accident. Early reports from Zoo Entertainment are that at least three of the band are listed in critical condition."<ref name="tdn - april fools 97">{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/news/aprilfools97.html | title=Tool News: April Fools 1997 | accessdate=2007-03-29 | author=Kabir Akhtar}}</ref></blockquote>

The hoax gained wide attention, and was eventually exposed on radio and MTV.<ref name="tdn - april fools 97"/> Akhtar later posted an apology, claiming that t.d.n. "will not indulge itself in such outlandish pranks in the future"<ref name="tdn - april fools 97"/> - a false claim as later pranks would prove. Of course, the tour continued the next day as originally announced. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at [[Lollapalooza]] '97 in July, this time as a headliner, gaining critical praise from ''[[The New York Times]]'':
<blockquote>"Tool was returning in triumph to Lollapalooza after appearing among the obscure bands on the festival's smaller stage in 1993. Now Tool is the prime attraction for a festival that's struggling to maintain its purpose. [...] Tool uses taboo-breaking imagery for hellfire moralizing in songs that swerve from bitter reproach to nihilistic condemnation. Its music has refined all the troubled majesty of grunge."<ref name="nytimeslollapalooza">{{cite web | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903EEDF1738F937A25754C0A961958260 | title=Lollapalooza's Recycled Hormones: Rebellion by the Numbers | work=The New York Times | accessdate=2006-03-06 | author=Jon Pareles}}</ref></blockquote>

''<U+00C6>nima'' proved to be able to match Tool's successful debut, selling equal numbers,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=August_1997--Circus.html | date= August, 1997 | title=Never Wanted To Be Rock Stars But They Are (transcript) | work=Circus | accessdate=2006-06-25 | author=Edward Fruchtman | quote =Both albums (Aenima and 1993s Undertow) have already exceeded a million in sales and their first release, [...] }}</ref> featuring the Grammy-awarded "[[<U+00C6>nema]]", and appearing on "Best Albums of 1996" lists as in ''[[Kerrang!]]''.<ref name="acclaimedaenima">{{cite web

[[Volcano Records]] &mdash; the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment &mdash; alleged contract violations by Tool and filed [[lawsuit|suit]]. Tool looked at offers from other record labels, an action not allowed by the contract, according to Volcano. After Tool filed a [[Lawsuit|counter suit]] stating that Volcano failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. The parties later agreed to a new contract and a three-record deal.<ref>{{cite web

Tool filed suit against Volcano, saying that the label had failed to exercise a renewal option in their contract, and so they were free to leave. This ugly deadlock lasted for over a year, when finally, at the last minute, both parties agreed to terms (including a three-record deal), rather than going to court.

In January 2001, Tool announced a new album, ''Systema Enc<U+00E9>phale'', along with a 12-song tracklist full of esoteric and obscure words such as "Riverchrist," "Numbereft," "Encephatalis," "Musick," and "Coeliacus."<ref name="tdnsystematracks">{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/news/oldnews/old0101.html | title=January - march 2001 | work=news archive | accessdate=2006-03-06 | author=Kabir Akhtar | quote=[[01/12/01]] - Yesterday, the Official Site reported a title and tracklist for the new album. The album is apparently called "Systema Enc<U+00E9>phale" and features 12 tracks: "Malfeasance, U.V.R., Numbereft, Encephatalis, Musick, Coeliacus, Pain Canal, Lactation, Smyrma, Riverchrist." Whether this is real, or another "we read the Joyful Guide to Lachrymology while recording <U+00C6>nima in eight days in France", is not yet clear. [...] [03/29/01] Sadly, yes, there are a whole lot of fake Tool songs out there on Napster now. I have no idea which they are, and keeping a list here would really take far too much time to be worth it. }}</ref> As anticipated, file-sharing engines such as [[Napster]] became flooded with bogus files disguised with those titles.<ref name="tdnsystematracks"/> During that time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of engines like Napster due to the negative impact on smaller artists that are dependent on success in record sales to continue their career. Keenan had this to say during an interview with ''NY Rock'' in 2000:

<blockquote>"I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by [[MP3]]s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2000/apc_int.asp | title=Interview with Maynard James Keenan of A Perfect Circle | work=NY Rock | accessdate=2006-04-28 | author=Gabriella}}</ref></blockquote>

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'', and included a personal highlight of the band: a 10-show mini-tour with King Crimson in August 2001, during which the progressive rock veterans opened for Tool. During a show at the [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] Keenan concluded: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with [[Led Zeppelin]], or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]]."<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour">{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=August_2001--MTV_Online.html | title=Tool Stretch Out And Slow Down In Show With King Crimson | work=MTV.com | accessdate=2007-03-23 | year=2001 | author=Laura Bond}}</ref> The tour eventually came to an end on [[November 24]] [[2002]] in [[Long Beach, California]] at [http://www.longbeachcc.com/arena.htm Long Beach Arena].

Although the end of the tour seemed to spell another dormancy for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with [[A Perfect Circle]], the other band members released an official yet fanclub exclusive interview and a recording of new material. On [[March 31]], [[2005]], the official website announced - to the shock of many fans and friends - that "Maynard has found Jesus" and would be abandoning the recording of the new Tool album temporarily and possibly permanently. [[Kurt Loder]] of [[MTV]] contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a very nonchalant confirmation.

==Musical traits, genre and influences==
Tool has gained appreciation and critical praise for a complex and ever-evolving sound,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200701120170.html | date=January 12, 2007 | title=In Sight/Music & Arts Tool frontman: 'I have not smashed up 1 hotel room' | work=International Herald Tribune/The Asahi Shimbun | accessdate=2007-05-25|author=C.B.

===Musical traits===
An essential component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the heavy use of odd meter [[time signature]]s. For instance, bassist Justin Chancellor describes the time signature employed on ''[[Lateralus|Lateralus']]'' first single "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]", as 6.5/8 and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times".<ref name="bassplayer052001">{{cite journal |last=Scott Shiraki & E.E.

Beyond this fundamental aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within their musical scope. In general, Chancellor's bass playing is characterized by "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility".<ref name="bassplayer052001"/> An example of this is the use of a [[Wah-wah|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient" (''Lateralus'' 2001).<ref name="bassplayer052001"/>

The band's drummer, Danny Carey, gained fame within the drum world for his use of [[tabla]]-style techniques, [[polyrhythm]]s, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded [[octoban]] drum patterns.<ref name="moderndrummer072006"/>

Maynard James Keenan's contribution to Tool's sound has been characterized more subjectively. Specific accolades attested him a "distinct and soft but powerful" singing voice (''Undertow'' 1993)<ref>{{cite web | url=

The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempt to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album.<ref name="livewire"/> In some instances, their song lyrics are arranged in extraordinary manner, such as in "Lateralus".

===Genre allusions===
The band is often described using [[umbrella term]]s and critics often place them in many different [[Musical genre|genres]] at the same time.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0638,sally,74479,22.html | title =Tool: An Appreciation | author =Zak Sally | work =The Village Voice | date =[[September 15]], 2006 | accessdate = 2007-05-09 | quote = ...they have transcended whatever genre label they are tagged with<U+2014>they aren't quite "metal," "prog" does not cut the mustard, "hard rock" is too vague, and "pop" is just plain wrong, although all those elements are in the mix. }}</ref> While seemingly contradictory, this is merely the result of "music genre" being "an ill-defined notion, that is not founded on any [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic property]] of the music, but rather depends on cultural [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|extrinsic]] habits",<ref>{{Citation

The band's next evolution involved more musical and visual art experimentation. Representing this is ''[[Lateralus|Lateralus']]'' elaborate album packaging and their complex live shows during the supporting tour, which sparked the use of the terms [[art rock]]<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/><ref name="kingcrimsonminitour"/><ref name="e!onlinelateralus"/> and art metal.<ref name="33 things"/><ref name="mtvnewssystema"/><ref name="munge">{{cite web | authorMilano, Brett| year=2006| title=Power Tool: Maynard James Keenan and band craft epic art-metal | format=HTML | work=Boston Herald | url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=139842 | accessdate=2006-05-27}}</ref> Simultaneously, the band expressed their kinship with one of their prime influences, King Crimson, whose first albums are considered to have pioneered [[progressive rock]], by launching a joint mini-tour. Comparisons between the two bands were made, calling the bands "the once and future kings of progressive rock".<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour"/> Reviews of ''Lateralus'' often considered it to be progressive rock,<ref name="rollingstonelateralus"/><ref name="AMG_Lateralus_review"/> while others favored its heavier counterpart, [[progressive metal]].<ref name="AllMusic Biography"/><ref name="soberencephale"/> However, longtime King Crimson member [[Robert Fripp]] downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview with Tool, he touched briefly on how the two bands relate to each other:

<blockquote>"Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." (Robert Fripp during a "Tool Army" exclusive interview)<ref>{{cite web | title= Tool Army exclusive interview | url=http://www.toolarmy.com/home/ | accessdate=2006-09-17}}</ref></blockquote>
Unsurprisingly, the band itself has a [[Satire|satirical]] point of view on this debate:

<blockquote>"As far as the prog references go, we embrace them. However, we would prefer our new moniker, which is a Mulligan stew of progressive rock, Bulgarian folk metal, rock <U+2019>n<U+2019> roll, <U+2019>80s disco and Christian rap that we like to call Munge." (Maynard James Keenan cited in Boston Herald, 2006)<ref name="munge"/></blockquote>

===Influence on other bands===
Meanwhile, Tool has impacted newer bands, such as the [[nu metal]] genre as a whole.<ref>{{cite web | author= Sean Richardson | title =Perfect circles - Tool connect on Lateralus | work =The Boston Phoenix | date =May 10, 2001 | url =http://72.166.46.24/boston/music/top/documents/01532143.htm | accessdate =2007-05-25 | quote=[...] today Tool are the well-respected pre-Korn godfathers of rock radio.

<blockquote>"I do not really see the connection. Because there is some intensity in some of our songs, I think these bands pick up the surface noise, and that's their influence. [...] When I hear these loud, goofy posturing idiots jumping up and down, more concerned about their hairdos than their music, it's just we do not do that, what am I missing? There's nothing to the music that moves me, or compels me to want to sit down and listen to it, which is unfortunate.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Tool-logo-early.jpg|thumb|right|The "Wrench", one of Tool's early logos, created by longtime collaborator [[Cam de Leon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lowelaw.com/articles/ | title=Visual Artist Cam De Leon's Lawsuit Against Rock Band TOOL Allowed to Proceed | work=Press release | accessdate=2007-06-15 | year=2006 | author=Lowe Law Lawyers agency}}</ref>]]
The band has circulated several stories surrounding the origin of their name. One of the most vital speculations revolved around [[lachrymology]], a [[pseudophilosophy]] that the band has stated was founded in 1949 by Ronald P. Vincent after the death of his wife in a snow plowing accident. Drummer [[Danny Carey]] alleged that the name "Tool" means that the band served its fans as a tool through which those people would come to understand the concept of lachrymology.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toolarmy.com/toolband/lachrymology/lachrymology.php?key=fob | title=Let Not My Tears Fall Unnoticed: Being the Secret Joys of a Lachrymist | work=toolarmy.com | accessdate=2007-05-06 | author=Blair MacKenzie Blake}}</ref> However, it is more likely that the band made this up in order to create a unique backdrop, since singer Maynard James Keenan gave a more direct approach to explaining his band's name in an interview in 1994:

<blockquote>"Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. It's also what it sounds like: It's a verb, it's a digging factor. It's an active process of searching, as in use us, we are a shovel, we are the match, we're the blotter of acid, your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://toolshed.down.net/articles/index.php?action=view-article&id=April_1994--RayGun.html | title=Tool Rules | work=RayGun Magazine | accessdate=2006-08-27 | year=1994 | author=Moon Unit Zappa}}</ref></blockquote>
