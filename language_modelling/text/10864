'''Sesame Workshop''' ('''SW''', or "'''the Workshop'''"), formerly known as the '''Children's Television Workshop''' ('''CTW'''), is a worldwide American [[non-profit organization]] behind the production of several educational children's programs, including its first and most well-known, ''[[Sesame Street]]'', that have run on public broadcasting around the world (including PBS in the United States).  Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] came up with the idea to form an organization to oversee the production of ''Sesame Street'', which would, through the medium of television, help prepare children, especially those from low-income families, for school.  They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new show.  Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".<ref name=":9" />

''Sesame Street'' premiered on PBS in November 1969, and the Workshop was formally incorporated shortly after, in 1970.  [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to conduct research for the show; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model".  They also hired a staff of producers and writers.  After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other TV shows.  The 1980s was a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments hurt them until licensing agreements stabilized their revenues by 1985.

After ''Sesame Street's'' initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were made up of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them.  Government funding ended by 1981, so they expanded into other areas, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and outreach programs to preschools.  By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the show was $96 million.  By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[Muppets]] accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees.

Cooney stepped down as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.  In 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop, to better reflect its entry into non-television and interactive media, and Gary E. Knell became CEO.  H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell in 2011.

''Sesame Street Unpaved''. New York: Hyperion Publishing, p. 9. ISBN 0-7868-6460-5</ref> Many children's television programs were produced by local stations, with little regard for educational goals, or cultural diversity,<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 7</ref> and the use of children's programming as an educational tool was "unproven" and "a revolutionary concept".<ref name=":0" /> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families, however, had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested "substantially lower"<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 5</ref> than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school.<ref>Lesser, Gerald S. and Joel Schneider (2001) "Creation and Evolution of the Sesame Street Curriculum".

In the summer of 1967, Cooney took a leave of absence from Channel 13, and funded by Carnegie Corporation, traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education".<ref>Davis, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> The report described what the new show, which became ''[[Sesame Street]]'', would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW).<ref name=":1" />

=== Founding ===
For the next two years, Cooney and Morrisett worked on researching and developing the new show, raising $8 million for ''Sesame Street'', and establishing the CTW.<ref>Morrow, p. 71</ref> Although Cooney, due to her professional experience, always assumed the natural home for the show was [[PBS]], Morrisett was open to airing the show on commercial television, but all three networks rejected the idea. Davis, considering ''Sesame Street's'' stream of licensing income in the decades to come, called their decision "a billion-dollar blunder".<ref>Davis, p. 114</ref> Morrisett was responsible for fund-raising, while Cooney was responsible for the show's creative development, and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW.<ref>Davis, p. 105</ref> The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $1 million grant, and Morrisett procured additional multi-million-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, the [[Arthur Vining Davis Foundations]], the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], and the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref>Davis, p. 8</ref> Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial networks, but caused challenges in procuring future funding.<ref>Lesser, p. 17</ref>

Cooney's proposal included using in-house formative research that would inform and improve production, and independent summative evaluations to test the show's impact on its young viewers' learning.<ref>Fisch, Shalom M. and Lewis Bernstein (2001) "Formative Research Revealed: Methodological and Process Issues in Formative Research".

ISBN 0-8058-3395-1</ref> In 1967, Morrisett recruited [[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Gerald S. Lesser]], whom he had met while they were both psychology students at [[Yale University|Yale]],<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 8</ref> to help develop and lead the Workshop's research department. Lesser also served as the first chairman of their advisory board, a position he held until his retirement in 1997.<ref>[http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news-impact/2010/09/remembering-professor-emeritus-gerald-lesser/ "Remembering Professor, Emeritus, Gerald Lesser"] (24 September 2010). ''Harvard Graduate School of Education.'' Accessed 25 December 2013</ref> According to Lesser, the CTW's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber-stamping the Workshop's decisions like most boards for other children's TV shows, they contributed significantly to the show's design and implementation.<ref>Lesser, pp. 42<U+2014>43</ref> Lesser reported in ''[[Children and Television: Lessons from Sesame Street]]'', his 1974 book about the beginnings of ''Sesame Street'' and the Children's Television Workshop, that roughly 8<U+2014>10% of the Workshop's initial budget was spent on research.<ref>Lesser, p. 132</ref>

CTW's summative research was done by the Workshop's first research director, [[Edward L. Palmer]], whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967. In the summer of 1968, Palmer began to create educational goals, define the Workshop's research activities, and hire his research team.<ref name=":2">Lesser, p. 39</ref> Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time.<ref>Davis, p. 144</ref> They were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later called the "CTW model".<ref>Morrow, p. 68</ref><ref>Cooney, Joan Ganz.

"Foreword". In Fisch, Shalom M. and Rosemarie T. Truglio, Eds. ''"G" is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street''. Mahweh, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers. p. xi. ISBN 0-8058-3395-1</ref>

The CTW devoted 8% of their initial budget to outreach and publicity.<ref>Lesser, p. 169</ref> In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called "an extensive campaign"<ref>Morrow, p. 112</ref> that Lesser stated "would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research",<ref name=":2" /> they promoted the show with educators, the broadcast industry, and their target audience, which consisted of inner-city children and their families. They hired Evelyn Davis from the [[Urban League]], whom Michael Davis called "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable",<ref>Davis, p. 154</ref> as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.<ref name=":2" /> Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new show, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention that surrounded ''Sesame Street'' its first year of production.<ref>Lesser, p. 40</ref>

According to Davis, despite her leadership in the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was put in doubt due to her lack of high-level managerial experience and leadership, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience in children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, "Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries".<ref>Davis, p. 124</ref> At first, Cooney did not fight for the position, but with the support of Tim Cooney and Morrisett, and after the investors of the project realized that they could not move forward without her, Cooney pursued it and was named the first executive director of CTW in February 1968.[36] As one of the first female executives in American television, her appointment was called "one of the most important television developments of the decade".<ref name=":9">Davis, pp. 125<U+2013>126</ref> The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City on May 20, 1968.<ref>Davis, p. 127</ref>

After her appointment, Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant; he was responsible to making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to air the new show.<ref>Lesser, p. 41</ref> She assembled a team of producers for the new show:<ref>Finch, Christopher (1993).

== Early years ==

During the second season of ''Sesame Street'', in order to capitalize on the momentum they were enjoying and the attention they received from the press, and to take advantage of the federal government's push to improve [[literacy]], the Workshop created its second show, ''[[The Electric Company]]'', in 1971. Morrisett used the same fund-raising techniques as he had used for ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, p. 216</ref> ''The Electric Company'' stopped production in 1977, but continued in re-runs until 1985; it eventually became one of the most widely-used TV shows in American classrooms<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">O'Dell, p. 75</ref> and was [[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|revived in 2009]].<ref>Davis, Michael (12 May 2008).

According to writer Cary O'Dell, the show "lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience".<ref>O'Dell, p. 74</ref> In 1977, they aired an adult drama called ''Best of Families'', which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century, but it lasted for six or seven episodes and helped them decide to focus on children's programs only.<ref name=":5">Shirley Wershba (27 April 1998).

Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's outreach efforts turned from promotion to the development of educational materials used in preschool settings.<ref>Yotive and Fisch, pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref> Early outreach efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in [[Appalachia]], in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] communities, and in [[migrant worker]] camps.<ref>Gikow, pp. 282<U+2013>283</ref> In the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the show as an educational resource.<ref>Yotive and Fisch, pp. 182<U+2013>183</ref> The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers.<ref>Gikow, pp. 280<U+2013>281</ref> The Workshop's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.<ref>Gikow, pp. 286<U+2013>293</ref>

According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s was a challenging period for the Workshop.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":6">Shirley Wershba (1998-04-27).

Retrieved 26 December 2013</ref> Other than ''Sesame Street'', many of its productions struggled finding an audience. ''[[3-2-1 Contact]]'' premiered in 1980, and ran in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this show and other science-oriented shows like ''[[Square One TV]]'', which ran from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the [[National Science Foundation]] and other foundations were interested in funding science education.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":7">Shirley Wershba (27 April 1998).

== Later years ==
Cooney stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in 1990, when she was replaced by David Britt, who was her "chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid-1990s"<ref>Davis, p. 260</ref> and whom Cooney called her "right-hand for many years".<ref name=":7" /> Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988.  At that time, Cooney became chairman of the Workshop's executive board, which oversaw its businesses and licensing, and became more involved in the organization's creative side.<ref>Carter, Bill (31 July 1990).

The Workshop went through a reorganization in 1995, and laid off about 12 percent of its staff.<ref>O'Dell, p. 76</ref> In 1998, for the first time in the show's history, they accepted funds from corporations to support ''Sesame Street'' and its other programs.<ref>Brooke, Jill (13 November 1998).

Knell stated, "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled that we were able to bring them home. It protected ''Sesame Street'' and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".<ref>Davis, p. 348</ref>

The CTW changed its name to the Sesame Workshop (SW) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non-television and interactive media.<ref>[http://www.muppetcentral.com/news/2000/060500.shtml "CTW Changes Name to Sesame Workshop".] Reuters (05 June 2000).

In 2007, the Sesame Workshop founded [[The Joan Ganz Cooney Center]], an independent, non-profit organization which studies how to improve children's literacy by using and developing digital technologies "grounded in detailed educational curriculum", just as was done during the development of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Jensen, Elizabeth (06 December 2007).

For the first time, a public broadcasting show had the potential to earn a great deal of money, so the show gained attention from marketers who wanted to take advantage of it.<ref name=":10" />  The Workshop explored other sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a "multiple media institution".<ref name=":12">Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref>  Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow put it, the Sesame Workshop endowment,<ref name=":13">Gikow, p. 268</ref> which had the potential to support the CTW and fund future productions and projects.<ref name=":11" />  Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during airings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203<U+2013>205</ref>  As Davis reported, "Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref>  In the early 1970s, the CTW approached [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum.<ref name=":11">Davis, p. 205</ref>

=== Publishing ===
In 1970, the CTW established a department overseeing the development of "nonbroadcast" materials based upon ''Sesame Street''. They decided that all materials their licensing program created would "underscore and amplify"<ref name=":11" /> the show's curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because they felt they would restrict children's imaginations.<ref name=":13" /> The CTW published ''Sesame Street Magazine'' in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 198</ref>  As with the show, research was conducted for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.<ref name=":12" />

Working with [[Random House]] editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to run ''Sesame Street's'' book publishing program.<ref name=":13" /><ref name=":11" /> In the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He left to become more involved with writing and composing music for the show,<ref>Davis, p. 206</ref> but was eventually replaced by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2009, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model followed by other children's shows.<ref name=":13" /> As of 2001, there were over 600 books available in the ''Sesame Street'' library,<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 209</ref> and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated, "the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street".<ref name=":12" />  In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was dealt with in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published shortly after the show dealt with it in 1983.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}
Director Jon Stone stated, about the music of ''Sesame Street'', "There was no other sound like it on television".<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref>  For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref>  Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an "affinity for commercial jingles",<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17</ref> so many of the show's songs were constructed like television ads.

In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the show, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, "helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show".<ref name="Davis 256">Davis, p. 256</ref> Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.<ref name="Davis 256"/> Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo, Jeff Moss, Christopher Cerf, Tony Geiss, and Norman Stiles. Many of the songs written for ''Sesame Street'' have become what writer David Borgenicht called "timeless classics".<ref>Borgenicht, David (1998). ''Sesame Street Unpaved.'' New York: Hyperion Publishing. p. 145. ISBN 0-7868-6460-5</ref>  These songs included the "Sesame Street Theme" (also known as "Sunny Day"), "I Love Trash", "Rubber Duckie", "Bein' Green", and "Sing". Many ''Sesame Street'' songs were recorded by well-known artists such as [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Jos<U+00E9> Feliciano|Jose Feliciano]].<ref name="Gikow 221">Gikow, p. 221</ref>

The show's first album, ''Sesame Street Book & Record'', recorded in 1970, went gold and won a Grammy.<ref>Gikow, p. 270</ref> '' Entertainment Weekly'' reported that by 1991, ''Sesame Street'' had received eight Grammys.<ref>Kohn, Martin F (1991-03-08).

Retrieved 21 January 2014</ref> According to Gikow, Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work on the show.<ref name="Gikow 221"/>

=== International co-productions ===
{{Main|International co-productions of Sesame Street}}
Shortly after ''Sesame Street'' debuted in the US, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show in their countries.<ref name=":15">Cole et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 147</ref> Cooney remarked, "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created".<ref name=":16">Knowlton, Linda Goldstein and Linda Hawkins Costigan (producers) (2006). ''The World According to Sesame Street ''(documentary). Participant Productions.</ref> She hired former [[CBS]] executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of ''Sesame Street'' in other countries. Dann's appointment resulted in television critic Marvin Kitman, referring to the May 1970 [[Mississippi]] state commission decision to ban the show,<ref>Guernsey, Lisa (23 May 2009). [http://www.newsweek.com/how-sesame-street-changed-world-80067 "How Sesame Street Changed the World".] ''Newsweek''. Retrieved 22 January 2014</ref> to state: "After [Dann] sells [''Sesame Street''] in [[Russia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".<ref>Davis, p. 209</ref> By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call "co-productions".

The earliest international versions were what CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues called "fairly simple",<ref name=":15" /> consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it.<ref>Gikow, p. 252</ref> Eventually, a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries.<ref name=":14" /> By 2006, there were twenty co-productions.<ref name=":16" /> In 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of ''Sesame Street'',<ref name=":15" /> and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.<ref>Gikow, p. 263</ref> In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of ''The New York Times'' reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.<ref>Carvajal, Doreen (12 December 2005).

{{Main|Sesame Street video games}}Ten years after the premiere of ''Sesame Street'', the CTW began experimenting with new technologies. In 1979, it began to plan the development of a theme park, Sesame Place, which did not open until 2006 in Philadelphia.<ref name=":17">Revelle, et al. in Fisch & Truglio, p. 215</ref><ref>Whitlock, Natalie Walker.

Although the park did not materialize for several decades, the team evolved into the Children's Computer Workshop (CCW) in 1982, which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s.<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":18">Gikow, p. 282</ref> As ''Sesame Street'' researcher Shalom M.

ISBN 0-8058-3936-4.</ref> shows like ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' or the ''Sesame Street'' segment "[[Elmo's World]]". The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television show's content and curriculum.<ref>Revelle et al. in Fisch & Truglio , p. 217</ref>

In 2008, a new "research-driven"<ref name=":18" /> website was created; it reached 18 million downloads in one month. Also in 2008, the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full-length episodes on [[Hulu]], [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]], where "Word on the Street" segments became the most popular webcast.<ref>Gikow, p. 285</ref> In 2010, the Workshop began offering [[Ebooks|eBooks]] through the website sesamestreet.org, including a free rotating selection of five titles. Their selection of eBooks came in a variety of formats, some of which were interactive, and covered nineteen subject areas, including letters, numbers, counting, colors, and cultural appreciation.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/20/idUS138288+20-May-2010+MW20100520 "Sesame Street eBookstore Debuts with Collection of More Than 100 Titles"] (Press release).
