'''Chris Casamassa''' (born January 17, 1965) is an American martial artist of half [[Italians|Italian]] half [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]] origin, actor and stuntman who is best known for his role as [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat character)|Scorpion]] in the movie ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]'', which was based on the popular fighting-game series. He was unavailable for the second movie, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'' (where he doubled for [[George Clooney]]), but he was able to return as Scorpion in the TV show, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]''. He is the son of martial arts guru and Red Dragon Karate founder Louis D. Casamassa. They appeared together in the film 'Sword of Heaven' in 1985.

Despite his success in landing roles in ''[[The Red Canvas]]'', ''[[Food Fight]]'', and ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', Casamassa is continuing to improve on his acting craft by studying with well-known Hollywood acting coach, Joel Asher{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

==Karate==
Casamassa is also the President of the successful Red Dragon Karate Schools, which were founded by his father. As a national competitor on the North American Karate Association circuit (N.A.S.K.A) Casamassa was the #1 forms competitor in the country for four consecutive years. During his time on the competition circuit, he won 18 Forms Grand 
Championship titles, 12 Weapons Grand Championships as well as being at top 10 ranked middleweight fighter {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. After he retired from active competition, Casamassa was voted into the American Karate Kung fu Federation, (A.K.K.F.) Hall of Fame, then soon after, he was selected as a member of the prestigious USA international Hall of Fame for two separate categories <U+201C>Top Competitor of the decade<U+201D> and <U+201C>Instructor of the Year.<U+201D>{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Biography===
Casamassa and his wife Michelle have two children Emily, age 7, and Adam, age 4. <U+201C>I am excited about training my kids in the Martial arts,<U+201D> says Casamassa. They were already following me with their kicks and punches at home. Now that they are in class at the studio its even more fun to watch them grow and learn in the Martial Arts. Casamassa trains at least 3 days a week for 3 to 4 hours. The Martial Arts is my passion, it is in my blood."{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In addition to his feature acting roles, Casamassa is also regularly working as a stunt man, having worked on the sets of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[V.I.P.]]'', and ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. One of Casamassa<U+2019>s biggest thrills came when he actually got to do a fight scene with World Black Belt<U+2019>s First Founding Member [[Chuck Norris]]. <U+201C>At first, Chuck was going to have a stunt man do the scene, but then we got to talking and he decided to test me out, it was really quite an honor,<U+201D> remembers Casamassa {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

Casamassa is one of the few original actors to be in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Devastation]]'', he announced that he will reprise his role as Scorpion. However, the film still has yet to officially go into production, and no information about the project exists on the official ''MK'' website produced by [[Threshold Entertainment]], which has not been updated since 2004.<ref name="MKsite">[http://mortalkombat.com/index-film.shtml mortalkombat.com - Threshold Entertainment]</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] reported in January 2010 that Warner Bros. had hired Oren Uziel to write a new script of the reboot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35528/finish-them-a-new-mortal-kombat-way|title=Finish Them! A New Mortal Kombat on the Way!|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref>
Paul W.S. Anderson, who had directed the original, expressed interest in returning to the franchise in a May 4 interview with [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]], though he is not currently under consideration to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/704421/Paul-WS-Anderson-Interested-In-Shooting-Another-Mortal-Kombat-Movie.html|title=Paul W.S.
