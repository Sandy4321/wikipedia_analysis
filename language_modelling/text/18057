'''Kilkis''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''<U+0398>/<U+039A> <U+039A><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03BA><U+03AF><U+03C2>''') was a 13,000 ton [[Mississippi class battleship|''Mississippi''-class]] Greek [[battleship]] (''<U+03B8><U+03C9><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03CC>'') named for a crucial [[Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas|battle]] of the [[Second Balkan War]]. Laid down for the [[United States Navy]] in 1903, she served in that navy as the [[USS Mississippi (BB-23)|USS ''Mississippi'' (BB-23)]] from 1908 until [[1914]], when both ''Mississippi''-class ships were purchased from the United States by Greece. The sale financed the purchase of the new dreadnought battleship USS ''Idaho.'' Taken over at Newport News, [[Virginia]], late in July of that year, the ship was seized by [[France]] along with the rest of the Greek Fleet in [[1916]] due to Greece's neutrality in [[World War I]] (see the [[National Schism]]). When the Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] was re-established as head of the entire country in June 1917 and Greece entered the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], France turned both battleships over to the Royal Hellenic Navy, and saw action in the [[1919]] [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Crimea|Crimean]] expedition in support of [[White movement|White Russian]] forces, and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Asia Minor Campaign]]. Kilkis served actively in the Royal Hellenic Navy until [[1932]]. In [[1935]], after a period in reserve, she became a training ship. She was sunk in the [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] channel by dive [[Stuka]] bombers on April 23, [[1941]], during the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]]. Her wreck was salvaged for scrap in the 1950s.
