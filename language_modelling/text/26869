On December 25, 2009, 23-year-old [[Nigeria]]n [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] made an attempt to detonate an explosive substance on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]]. The international flight originated in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] and made an emergency landing at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], United States. All 290 people aboard the flight, including the attacker, survived, though he and several others sustained injuries, most of them minor. After being released from a local hospital, Abdulmutallab was indicted by a federal grand jury on six criminal counts. In the aftermath of the attack, various countries and agencies updated security protocols and opened investigations into the incident.

Representative Hoekstra said that Detroit may not have been singled out for the attack, but the focus may have simply been to attack a destination with many international travelers.

On January 7, 2010, [[James L.

He said that President Obama would be "legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behavior that were available, were not acted on."<ref>{{vcite news|publisher=Fox News|title=National Security Adviser Says Airline Bomber Report Will 'Shock' Americans|date=January 7, 2010|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/01/07/national-security-adviser-airline-bomber-report-shock/|accessdate=January 7, 2010}}</ref>

The U.S. also increased the installation and use of full-body scanners in many of its major airports as a result of the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including [[O'Hare International Airport]] in [[Chicago]], began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following [[fiscal year]], starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors.<ref name="Bloomberg body scanners">{{vcite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-05/u-s-adding-body-scanners-at-11-airports-napolitano-says.html|title=U.S. Adding Full-Body Bomb Scanners at 11 Airports (Update3)|author=Hughes, John|date=March 5, 2010|work=BusinessWeek|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Chicago Tribune body scanners">{{vcite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-met-airport-body-scanner-20100223,0,3580465.story|title=Full-body scanner arriving at O<U+2019>Hare|author=Mack, Kristen|date=February 24, 2010|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}</ref>

Abdulmutallab's "age, name, illogical travel route, high-priced ticket purchased at the last minute, his boarding without luggage (only a carry-on), and many other signs should have been sufficient to alert the security officers and warrant further examination of the suspect.
