The '''[[Roman province]] of Africa''' (named for [[Afri|a people who lived there]]) was established after the Romans defeated [[Carthage]] in the [[Third Punic War]]. It roughly comprised the territory of present-day northern [[Tunisia]], and the small [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast of modern-day western [[Libya]] along the [[Syrtis Minor]]. The [[Arab]]s later named roughly the same region as the original province [[Ifriqiya]], a rendering of ''Africa''.

==History==
{{Further|History of Tunisia|History of Algeria|History of Africa|Numidia|Mauretania}}

The land acquired for the province of Africa was the site of the ancient city of [[Carthage]]. Other large cities in the region included [[Hadrumetum]] (modern [[Sousse]], [[Tunisia]]), capital of [[Byzacena]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba (city)|Annaba]], [[Algeria]]). The province was established by the [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BC, following the [[Third Punic War]]. Rome established its first African colony, ''Africa Proconsularis'' or ''Africa Vetus'' (Old Africa), governed by a [[proconsul]], in the most fertile part of what was formerly Carthaginian territory. [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] was formed as the administrative capital. The remaining territory was left in the domain of the [[Numidia]]n [[client king]] [[Massinissa]]. At this time, the Roman policy in Africa was simply to prevent another great power from rising on the far side of [[Sicily]]. In 118 BC, the Numidian prince [[Jugurtha]] attempted to reunify the smaller kingdoms. However, upon his death, much of Jugurtha's territory was placed in the control of the Mauretanian client king [[Bocchus I|Bocchus]]; and, by that time, the romanization of Africa was firmly rooted. In 27 BC, when the [[Roman Republic|Republic]] had transformed into an [[Roman Empire|Empire]], the province of Africa began its [[Imperialism|Imperial]] occupation under Roman rule.

Several political and provincial reforms were implemented by [[Augustus]] and later by [[Caligula]], but [[Claudius]] finalized the territorial divisions into official Roman provinces. Africa was a senatorial province. After [[Diocletian]]'s administrative reforms, it was split into ''Africa Zeugitana'' (which retained the name ''Africa Proconsularis'', as it was governed by a [[proconsul]]) in the north and ''[[Byzacena|Africa Byzacena]]'' in the south, both of which were part of the ''[[Diocese of Africa|Dioecesis Africae]]''. The region remained a part of the Roman Empire until the great Germanic migrations of the 5th century. The [[Vandals]] crossed into North Africa from Spain in 429 and overran the area by 439 and founded their own kingdom, including [[Sicily]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]] and the [[Balearic Islands|Balearics]]. The Vandals controlled the country as a warrior-elite, enforcing a policy of strict separation and suppressing the local Romano-African population. They also persecuted the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faithful, as the Vandals were adherents of the [[Arian heresy]] (the semi-trinitarian doctrines of Arius, a priest of Egypt). In 476, when the [[Roman Empire]], had finally [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fallen]], it became a remanent of the [[Western Roman Empire|Empire]]. Towards the end of the 5th century, the Vandal state fell into decline, abandoning most of the interior territories to the Mauri and other Berber tribes of the desert.

In AD 533, Emperor [[Justinian]], using a Vandal dynastic dispute as pretext, sent an army under the great general [[Belisarius]] to recover Africa. In a [[Vandalic War|short campaign]], Belisarius defeated the Vandals, entered [[Carthage]] in triumph and succeeded in reestablishing Roman rule over the province. The restored Roman administration was successful in fending off the attacks of the Amazigh desert tribes, and by means of an extensive fortification network managed to extend its rule once again to the interior. The North African provinces, together with the Roman possessions in Spain, were grouped into the [[Exarchate of Africa]] by Emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]]. The exarchate prospered, and from it resulted the overthrow of the tyrannical emperor [[Phocas]] by [[Heraclius]] in 610. Its stability and strength in the beginning of the 7th century can be seen from the fact that Heraclius briefly considered moving the imperial capital from [[Constantinople]] to Carthage. Faced with the onslaught of the Muslim Conquest after 640, and despite occasional setbacks, the exarchate managed to stave off the threat, but in 698, a Muslim army from [[Egypt]] sacked Carthage and conquered the exarchate, ending Roman and Christian rule in North Africa. Thus the last of the provinces of the Western Roman Empire had ceased to exist, 222 years after the fall of Rome and the [[Romulus Augustulus|last Western Roman emperor]].

The African provinces were amongst the wealthiest regions in the Empire (rivaled only by Egypt, Syria and Italy itself) and as a consequence people from all over the Empire migrated into the Roman Africa Province, most importantly [[Roman Army|veterans]] in early retirement who settled in Africa on farming plots promised for their military service. Historian [[Theodore Mommsen]] estimated that under [[Hadrian]] nearly 1/3 of the eastern [[Numidia]] population (roughly modern [[Tunisia]]) was descended from Roman veterans. Even so, the Roman military presence of North Africa was relatively small, consisting of about 28,000 troops and auxiliaries in Numidia and the two Mauretanian provinces. Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants. A sizable [[Latin]] speaking population developed that was multinational in background, sharing the north African region with those speaking [[Punic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]] languages.<ref>Abun-Nasr, ''A History of the Maghrib'' (1970, 1977) at 35-37.</ref><ref>Laroui challenges the accepted view of the prevalence of the Latin language, in his ''The History of the Maghrib'' (1970, 1977) at 45-46.</ref> Imperial security forces began to be drawn from the local population, including the Berbers. 

Abun-Nasr, in his ''A History of the Maghrib'', said that "What made the Berbers accept the Roman way of life all the more readily was that the Romans, though a colonizing people who captured their lands by the might of their arms, did not display any racial exclusiveness and were remarkably tolerant of [[Early History of Tunisia#Ancient Berber religion|Berber religious cults]], be they indigenous or [[History of Punic era Tunisia#Punic religion|borrowed from the Carthaginians]]. However, the Roman  territory in Africa was unevenly penetrated by Roman culture. Pockets of non-Romanized Berbers continued to exist throughout the Roman period, even in such areas as eastern Tunisia and Numidia."

By the end of the Western Roman Empire nearly all of the Maghreb was fully [[Romanization|romanized]], according to Mommsen in his ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire'' and the Roman Africans enjoyed a high level of prosperity. This prosperity (and romanization) touched partially even the populations living outside the [[Roman limes]] (mainly the [[Garamantes]] and the [[Getuli]]), who were reached with [[Roman expeditions to Sub-Saharan Africa]].

==Economics==
The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture. Called the "granary of the empire", North Africa, according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, one-quarter of which was exported. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits. By the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. In addition to the cultivation of slaves, and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.

The incorporation of colonial cities into the Roman Empire brought an unparalleled degree of urbanization to vast areas of territory, particularly in North Africa. This level of rapid urbanization had a structural impact on the town economy, and artisan production in Roman cities became closely tied to the agrarian spheres of production. As Rome's population grew, so did her demand for North African produce. This flourishing trade allowed the North African provinces to increase artisan production in rapidly developing cities, making them highly organized urban centers. Many Roman cities shared both consumer and producer model city aspects, as artisanal activity was directly related to the economic role cities played in long-distance trade networks. The urban population became increasingly engaged in the craft and service sectors and less in agrarian employment, until a significant portion of the town<U+2019>s vitality came from the sale or trade of products through middlemen to markets in areas both rural and abroad. The changes that occurred in the infrastructure for agricultural processing, like olive oil and wine production, as trade continued to develop both cities and commerce directly influenced the volume of artisan production. The scale, quality, and demand for these products reached its acme in Roman North Africa.<ref>Wilson, A. I., 2002. Papers of the British School at Rome. Vol 70, Urban Production in the Roman World:

===Pottery production===
[[File:African Red Slip vessels.JPG|thumb|230px|African Red Slip flagons and vases, 2nd-4th century]]
[[File:Roman pottery African Red Slip.jpg|thumb||230px|A typical plain African Red Slip dish with simple rouletted decoration. 4th century.]]
{{Main|African Red Slip}}
The North African provinces spanned across regions rich with olive plantations and potters' clay sources, which led to the early development of fine [[Ancient Roman pottery]], especially [[African Red Slip]] ''[[terra sigillata]]'' tableware and clay [[oil lamp]] manufacture, as a crucial industry. Lamps provided the most common form of illumination in Rome. They were used for public and private lighting, as votive offerings in temples, lighting at festivals, and as grave goods. As the craft developed and increased in quality and craftsmanship, the North African creations began to rival their Italian and Grecian models and eventually surpassed them in merit and in demand. The innovative use of molds around the 1st c. BC allowed for a much greater variety of shapes and decorative style, and the skill of the lamp maker was demonstrated by the quality of the decoration found typically on the flat top of the lamp, or discus, and the outer rim, or shoulder. The production process took several stages. The decorative motifs were created using small individual molds, and were then added as appliqu<U+00E9> to a plain archetype of the lamp. The embellished lamp was then used to make two plaster half molds, one lower half and one upper half mold, and multiple copies were then able to be mass produced. Decorative motifs ranged according to the lamp's function and to popular taste. Ornate patterning of squares and circles were later added to the shoulder with a stylus, as well as palm trees, small fish, animals, and flower patterns. The discus was reserved for conventional scenes of gods, goddesses, mythological subjects, scenes from daily life, erotic scenes, and natural images. The strongly Christian identity of post-Roman society in North Africa is exemplified in the later instances of North African lamps, on which scenes of Christian images like saints, crosses, and biblical figures became commonly articulated topics. However, traditional mythological symbols had enduring popularity as well, which can be traced back to North Africa's Punic heritage. Many of the early North African lamps that have been excavated, especially those of high quality, have the name of the manufacturer inscribed on the base, which gives evidence for a highly competitive and thriving local market that developed early and continued to influence and bolster the colonial economy.<ref>Brouillet, Monique Seefried., ed. 1994. ''From Hannibal to Saint Augustine: Ancient Art of North Africa from the Musee Du Louvre'', 82-83, 129-130. Atlanta: Emory University.</ref>

After a period of artisanal, political, and social decline in the 3rd century AD, lamp-making revived and accelerated artistry in the early Christian age to new heights. The introduction of fine local red-fired clays in the late 4th century triggered this revival. [[African Red Slip]] ware (ARS), or African Terra Sigillata, revolutionized the pottery and lamp-making industry.<ref>Brouillet, Monique Seefried., ed. 1994. ''From Hannibal to Saint Augustine: Ancient Art of North Africa from the Musee Du Louvre'', 129-130. Atlanta: Emory University.</ref> ARS ware was produced from the last third of the 1st c. AD onwards, and was of major importance in the mid-to-late Roman periods. Famous in antiquity as "fine" or high-quality tableware, it was distributed both regionally and throughout the Mediterranean basin along well-established and heavily-trafficked trade routes. North Africa's economy flourished as its products were dispersed and demand for its products dramatically increased.<ref name="Mackensen 2006">Mackensen, Michael and Gerwulf Schneider. 2006. <U+201C>Production centres of African Red Slip Ware (2nd-3rd c.) in northern and central Tunisia: Archaeological provenance and reference groups based on chemical analysis.<U+201D> ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 19: 163-188.</ref> Initially, the ARS lamp designs imitated the simple design of third to 4th century courseware lamps, often with globules on the shoulder or with fluted walls. But new, more ornate designs appeared before the early 5th century as demand spurred on the creative process. The development and widespread distribution of ARS finewares marks the most distinctive phase of North African pottery-making.<ref>Brouillet, Monique Seefried., ed. 1994. ''From Hannibal to Saint Augustine: Ancient Art of North Africa from the Musee Du Louvre'', 129. Atlanta: Emory University.</ref>

These characteristic pottery lamps were produced in large quantities by efficiently organized production centers with large-scale manufacturing abilities, and can be attributed to specific pottery-making centers in northern and central Tunisia by way of modern chemical analysis, which allows modern archeologists to trace distribution patterns among trade routes both regional and across the Mediterranean.<ref name="Mackensen 2006"/> Some major ARS centers in central Tunisia are Sidi Marzouk Tounsi, Henchir el-Guellal (Djilma), and Henchir es-Srira, all of which have ARS lamp artifacts attributed to them by the microscopic chemical makeup of the clay fabric as well as macroscopic style prevalent in that region. This underscores the idea that these local markets fueled the economy of not only the town itself, but the entire region and supported markets abroad. Certain vessel forms, fabrics, and decorative techniques like rouletting, appliqu<U+00E9>, and stamped d<U+00E9>cor, are specific for a certain region and even for a certain pottery center. If neither form nor decoration of the material to be classified is identifiable, it is possible to trace its origins, not just to a certain region but even to its place of production by comparing its chemical analysis to important northeastern and central Tunisian potteries with good representatives.

==Known governors of Roman Africa==

===Republican era===
Unless otherwise noted, names of governors in Africa and their dates are taken from [[T.R.S. Broughton]],  ''The Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', (New York: American Philological Association, 1951, 1986), vol. 1, and vol. 2 (1952).

====146<U+2013>100 BC====
Inscriptional evidence is less common for this period than for the Imperial era, and names of those who held a ''provincia'' are usually recorded by historians only during wartime or by the [[Fasti#Fasti triumphales|triumphal ''fasti'']]. After the defeat of Carthage in 146 BC, no further assignments to Africa among the senior magistrates or promagistrates are recorded until the [[Jugurthine War]] (112<U+2013>105 BC), when the command against [[Jugurtha]] in [[Numidia]] became a consular province.
