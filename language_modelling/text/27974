'''''Yamato''''' (<U+5927><U+548C>), named after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], was the lead ship of the [[Yamato class battleship|Yamato class]] of [[battleship]]s that served with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. She and her sister ship, [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], were the largest, heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load and armed with nine 46&nbsp;cm (18.1&nbsp;inch) main guns. Neither survived the war.

Laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned in late 1941, ''Yamato'' was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the United States, Japan's main rival in the Pacific. Throughout 1942 she served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet]], and in June 1942 Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] directed the fleet from her bridge during the disastrous [[Battle of Midway]]. ''Musashi'' took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and ''Yamato'' spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of [[Truk]] and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in response to American threats. Although she was present at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, ''Yamato'' played no part in the battle. The only time she fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. On the verge of success the Japanese force turned back, believing they were engaging an entire US carrier fleet rather than the light escort-carrier group that was all that stood between ''Yamato'' and the vulnerable troop transports.

During 1944 the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945 the Japanese fleet was much depleted and critically short of fuel stocks in the home islands, limiting its usefulness. In April 1945, in a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, ''Yamato'' was [[Operation Ten-Go|dispatched on a one-way voyage]] to [[Okinawa]], where it was intended that she should protect the island from invasion and fight until destroyed. Her task force was spotted south of [[Kyushu]] by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.

==Design and construction==
{{Main|Yamato class battleship}}
[[Image:Yamato battleship under construction.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A view over a dock containing a large warship in the final stages of construction. Hills and a town can be seen across the harbour, a number of other ships are visible in the middle distance, and filling the foreground the warship's deck is littered with cables and equipment.|''Yamato'' near the end of her [[fitting-out]], 20 September 1941<ref name="G&D55">Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 55.</ref>]]

During the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an [[ultranationalist]] militancy with a view to greatly expanding the [[Japanese Empire]].<ref>Willmott (2000), p. 32.</ref> Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 44.</ref> No longer bound by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy designed the [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'' class]] of heavy battleships in the late 1930s. ''Yamato'' was the lead ship of the class.<ref>Skulski (2004), pp. 8<U+2013>11.</ref> Planners recognised that Japan would be unable to compete with the output of United States (US) naval shipyards should war break out, so the vessels of the ''Yamato'' class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.<ref name=johnston122>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 122.</ref><ref>Willmott (2000), p. 35. The Japanese Empire produced 3.5% of the world's industrial output, while the United States produced 35%.</ref> They displaced over 70,000 tons each, and it was hoped that their firepower would offset American naval production capabilities.<ref name=jackson74/>

''Yamato''{{'}}s keel was laid down at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]], [[Hiroshima]], on 4 November 1937, in a dockyard that had to be adapted to accommodate its enormous hull.<ref name=johnston123/><ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 52<U+2013>54.</ref> The dock was deepened by one metre, and gantry cranes capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed.<ref name=johnston123>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 123.</ref><ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 53.</ref> Fearful that the United States would learn of the vessel's characteristics, the Japanese erected a canopy over part of the [[slipway]] to screen the ship from view.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref> ''Yamato'' was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command.<ref name=G&D54>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 54.</ref>

===Armament===
''Yamato''{{'}}s main battery consisted of nine 460&nbsp;millimetre (18.1&nbsp;in) [[40 cm/45 Type 94|45 Calibre Type 94]] naval guns<U+2014>the largest calibre of naval artillery ever fitted to a warship.<ref name=jackson75>Jackson (2000), p. 75.</ref> Each gun was {{convert|21.13|m|ft}} long, weighed {{convert|147.3|t|ST}}, and was capable of firing high-explosive or armour-piercing shells {{convert|42.0|km|mi}}.<ref>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 123. Because of the size of the guns and thickness of armour, each of the three main turrets weighed more than a good-sized destroyer.</ref> Her secondary battery comprised twelve {{convert|155|mm|in|adj=on}} guns mounted in four triple turrets (one forward, one aft, two midships), and twelve {{convert|127|mm|in|adj=on}} guns in six twin mounts (three on each side amidships). In addition, ''Yamato'' carried twenty-four {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on}} anti-aircraft guns, primarily mounted amidships.<ref name=jackson75/> When refitted in 1944 and 1945 for naval engagements in the South Pacific,<ref name="jackson128">Jackson (2000), p. 128.</ref> the secondary battery configuration was changed to six 155&nbsp;mm guns and twenty-four 127&nbsp;mm guns, and the number of 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns was increased to 162.<ref name=johnston180>Johnston and McAuley (2000), p. 180.</ref>

==Service==
===Trials and initial operations===
During October or November 1941 ''Yamato'' underwent [[sea trial]]s, reaching her maximum possible speed of {{convert|27.4|knots}}.<ref name="G&D54"/>{{#tag:ref|Garzke/Dulin and Whitley's books do not give specific dates, and disagree on the month; the former gives October, and the latter gives November.<ref name="G&D54"/><ref name="Whitley211">Whitley (1998), p. 211.</ref>|group=N}} As war loomed, priority was given to accelerating military construction. On 16 December&mdash;months ahead of schedule&mdash;the battleship was formally commissioned at Kure.  The ceremony was more austere than usual; the Japanese were still intent on concealing the ship's characteristics.<ref name="G&D54"/> The same day, under Captain (later Vice Admiral) Gihachi Takayanagi, she joined fellow battleships {{ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Mutsu||2}} in the 1st Battleship Division.<ref name=Skulski10>Skulski (2004), p. 10.</ref>

On 12 February 1942, ''Yamato'' became the flagship of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]].<ref name="G&D54"/><ref name="Whitley211"/> The Japanese admiral was planning a decisive engagement with the United States Navy at [[Midway Island]], so after participating in [[Military simulation|war game]]s ''Yamato'' departed [[Hiroshima Bay]] on 27 May for duty with Yamamoto's main battleship group.<ref name="G&D54"/><ref name=ballard36>Ballard (1999), p. 36.</ref> US codebreakers were aware of Yamamoto's intentions and the [[Battle of Midway]] proved disastrous for Japan's carrier force, with four fleet carriers and 332 aircraft destroyed.<ref name="G&D54"/> Yamamoto exercised overall command from ''Yamato''{{'}}s bridge,<ref name=ballard36/> but his battleplan had widely dispersed his forces to lure the Americans into a trap, and the battleship group was too far away to take part in the engagement.<ref name="G&D54"/> On 5 June, Yamamoto ordered the remaining ships to return to Japan, so ''Yamato'' withdrew with the main battleship force to [[Hashirajima]] before making her way back to Kure.<ref name="Whitley211"/><ref name=Skulski10/>

''Yamato'' left Kure for [[Truk]] on 17 August 1942.<ref name=cfrecord>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/yamato.htm|title= Combined Fleet <U+2013> tabular history of ''Yamato''|accessdate=1 April 2010 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |year=2009}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Whitley says that ''Yamato'' left six days earlier (the 11th).<ref name="Whitley211"/>|group=N}} After 11 days at sea, she was sighted by the American submarine {{USS|Flying Fish|SS-229|6}}, which fired four torpedoes.

''Yamato'' escorted Transport Operation BO-1 from Truk to Yokosuka during 12&ndash;17 December.<ref name="Whitley212"/> Subsequently, because of their extensive storage capacity and thick armour protection, ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were pressed into service as transport vessels.<ref name=S-78-147/> On 25 December, while ferrying troops and equipment&mdash;which were wanted as reinforcements for the garrisons at [[Kavieng]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]]&mdash;from Yokosuka to Truk, ''Yamato'' and her task group were intercepted by the American submarine {{USS|Skate|SS-305|2}} about {{convert|180|mi|km}} out at sea.<ref name="G&D54"/><ref name="Whitley213">Whitley (1998), p. 213.</ref> ''Skate'' fired a spread of four torpedoes at ''Yamato''; one struck the battleship's starboard side towards the stern.<ref name="G&D54"/> A hole {{convert|5|m|ft}} below the top of her [[anti-torpedo bulge]] and measuring some {{convert|25|m|ft}} across was ripped open in the hull, and a joint between the upper and lower armoured belts failed, causing the rear turret's upper magazine to flood.<ref name="G&D55"/> ''Yamato'' took on {{convert|3000|LT|t}} of water,<ref name="G&D55"/><ref name="Whitley213"/> but reached Truk later that day.  Repair ship {{Ship|Japanese repair ship|Akashi||2}} effected temporary repairs on the battleship,<ref name="cfrecord"/> and ''Yamato'' departed on 10 January for Kure.<ref name="Whitley213"/>

On 16 January 1944, ''Yamato'' arrived at Kure for repairs and was drydocked until 3 February 1944.<ref name=cfrecord/> During this time, armour plate [[sloped armor|sloped]] at {{degree|45}} was fitted in the area of the torpedo damage; it had been proposed that {{convert|5000|LT|t}} of steel be used to bolster the ship's defense against flooding from torpedo hits outside the armoured citadel, but this was rejected out-of-hand because the additional weight would have increased ''Yamato''{{'}}s displacement and [[draft (nautical)|draft]] by too great a margin.<ref name="G&D55"/> While ''Yamato'' was drydocked, Captain Nobuei Morishita<U+2014>former captain of the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}<U+2014>assumed command.<ref name=cfrecord/> On 25 February, both ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were reassigned from the 1st Battleship Division to the Second Fleet.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===
{{Main|Battle of the Philippine Sea}}

In early June, ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' were again requisitioned as troop transports, this time to reinforce the garrison and naval defenses of the island of [[Biak]] as part of [[Operation Kon]].<ref name=S-78-147>Steinberg (1978), p. 147.</ref><ref name="G&D56">Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 56.</ref> The mission was cancelled when word reached Ozawa's headquarters of American carrier attacks on the [[Mariana Islands]].<ref name=S-78-147/> Instead the Imperial Japanese Navy reorganized, concentrating the majority of its remaining fighting strength in the hope of achieving a decisive success against the Americans. By this time though, the entire Japanese navy was inferior in numbers and experience to the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]].<ref name="G&D56"/> From 19 June to 23 June 1944, ''Yamato'' escorted forces of Ozawa's Mobile Fleet during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], dubbed by American pilots "The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot".<ref name="G&D56"/><ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 139.</ref> The Japanese lost three aircraft carriers and 426 aircraft;<ref name="G&D56"/> ''Yamato''{{'}}s only significant contribution was mistakenly opening fire on returning Japanese aircraft.<ref name=cfrecord/>

Following the battle ''Yamato'' withdrew with the Mobile Fleet to the [[Hashirajima]] staging area near Kure to refuel and rearm. With ''Musashi'' she left the fleet on 24 June for the short journey to Kure, where she received five more triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts.<ref name="G&D56"/> The opportunity was taken to put in place "emergency buoyancy-keeping procedures." These resulted in the removal of almost every flammable item from the battleship, including linoleum, bedding, and mattresses. In place of the latter, men slept on planks which could be used to repair damage. Flammable paints received a new [[silicon]]-based overcoat, and additional portable pumps and fire-fighting apparatus were installed.<ref name="G&D56"/> Leaving Japan on 8 July, ''Yamato''<U+2014>accompanied by the battleships ''Musashi'', {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kongo||2}}, ''Nagato'', and eleven cruisers and destroyers<U+2014>sailed south. ''Yamato'' and ''Musashi'' headed for the [[Lingga Islands]], arriving on 16<U+2013>17 July. By this stage of the war Japan's tanker fleet had been much reduced by marauding American submarines, so major fleet units were stationed in the East Indies to be near the source of their fuel supply.<ref name="G&D56"/> The battleships remained at the islands for the next three months.<ref name="G&D56"/>

===Battle of Leyte Gulf===

Between 22 October and 25 October 1944, as part of Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Centre Force (also known as Force A or First Striking Force), ''Yamato'' took part in one of the largest naval engagements in history<U+2014>the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]].<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 152.</ref> In response to the American invasion of the Philippines, Operation Sh<U+014D>-G<U+014D> called for a number of Japanese groups to converge on the island of Leyte, where American troops were landing. On 18 October, ''Yamato'' was given a coating of black camouflage in preparation for her nighttime transit of the [[San Bernardino Strait]]; the main ingredient was [[soot]] taken from her smokestack.<ref name=cfrecord/> While en route to Leyte the force [[Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage (23 October)|was attacked in Palawan Passage]] on 23 October by the submarines {{USS|Darter|SS-227|6}} and {{USS|Dace|SS-247|2}}, which sank two [[Takao class cruiser|''Takao''-class]] [[heavy cruiser]]s including Kurita's flagship, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Atago||2}}, and damaged a third.<ref name="G&D57">Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 57.</ref> Kurita survived the loss of ''Atago'' and transferred his flag to ''Yamato''.<ref name=cfrecord/> The following day the [[Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf#Sibuyan Sea airstrike (24 October)|Battle of the Sibuyan Sea]] hurt the Centre Force badly with the loss of three more heavy cruisers, eliminating a substantial part of the fleet's anti-aircraft defence. During the course of the day, American carrier aircraft sortied a total of 259 times. Aircraft from the {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}} struck ''Yamato'' with two armour-piercing bombs and scored one near miss; ''Yamato'' suffered moderate damage and took on about {{convert|3370|t|LT}} of water.<ref name="G&D58">Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 58.</ref> ''Musashi'' sank after being hit with 17 torpedoes and 19 bombs.<ref>Skulski (2004), p. 11.</ref>

Unknown to the Japanese admiral, the main American defensive force with Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.]] departed Leyte on the evening of 24 October. Convinced that Kurita's Centre Force had been turned back, Halsey took his powerful [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] in pursuit of the Japanese Northern Force, a decoy group composed of one fleet aircraft carrier ({{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}), three light carriers, two [[Ise class battleship|''Ise''-class]] hybrid battleship-carriers, and their escorts.<ref name="G&D57"/> The deception was a success, drawing away five fleet carriers and five light carriers with more than 600 aircraft among them,<!--are you sure this number is that small?

As the final step before their [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion]] of the Japanese mainland, Allied forces [[Battle of Okinawa|invaded Okinawa]] on 1 April.<ref name=Feifer-7>Feifer (2001), p. 7.</ref> The Imperial Japanese Navy's response was to organise a mission codenamed [[Operation Ten-Go]] that would see the commitment of much of Japan's remaining surface strength. ''Yamato'' and nine escorts (the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi||2}} and eight destroyers) would sail to Okinawa and, in concert with ''[[kamikaze]]'' and Okinawa-based army units, attack the Allied forces assembled on and around Okinawa. ''Yamato'' would then [[beaching (nautical)|beach]] herself to act as an unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed.<ref name=R166/><ref name="G&D60"/> In preparation for the mission, ''Yamato'' had taken on a full stock of ammunition on 29 March.<ref name=cfrecord/> According to the Japanese plan, the ships were supposed to take aboard only enough fuel for a one-way voyage to Okinawa, but additional fuel amounting to 60 percent of capacity was issued on the authority of local base commanders. Designated the "Surface Special Attack Force", the ships left [[Tokuyama, Yamaguchi|Tokuyama]] at 15:20 on 6 April.<ref name=R166>Reynolds (1982), p. 166.</ref><ref name="G&D60">Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 60.</ref>

Unfortunately for the Japanese, the Allies had intercepted and decoded their radio transmissions, learning the particulars of Operation Ten-Go. Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the [[Bungo Strait]], was spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}. Both reported ''Yamato''{{'}}s position to the main [[Fast Carrier Task Force|American carrier strike-force]],<ref name="jackson128"/><ref name="G&D60"/> but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships<U+2014>{{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}<U+2014>and their extreme [[zigzag]]ging.<ref name="G&D60"/>

The Allied forces around Okinawa began to brace for an assault. Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]] ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in the sector to prepare for surface action against ''Yamato''. These orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]]'s aircraft carriers, but as a contingency the battleships together with seven cruisers and twenty-one destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force before it could reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft.<ref name="G&D60"/>{{#tag:ref|Authors Garzke and Dulin speculate that the likely outcome of a battle between the two forces would have been a victory for the Allies, but at a serious cost due to the large margin of superiority ''Yamato'' held over the old battleships in firepower (460&nbsp;mm vs. 356&nbsp;mm), armour and speed ({{convert|27|knots}} vs. {{convert|21|knots}}).<ref name="G&D60"/>|group=N}}

''Yamato''{{'}}s crew were at [[general quarters]] and ready for anti-aircraft action by dawn on 7 April. The first Allied aircraft made contact with the Surface Special Attack Force at 08:23; two [[flying boat]]s arrived soon thereafter, and for the next five hours, ''Yamato'' fired [[Beehive (ammunition)|Beehive Common Type 3]] (''3 Shiki ts<U+00FB>j<U+00F4>dan'') shells at the Allied seaplanes, but could not prevent them from shadowing the force. ''Yamato'' obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later American F6F Hellcat fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.<ref name="G&D61">Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 60<U+2013>61.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The poor quality of the Japanese naval radar during World War II meant that only large groups of planes could be detected. Smaller detachments were usually picked up via line-of-sight|group=N}}

At about 12:30, 280 bomber and torpedo-bomber aircraft arrived over the Japanese force. {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asashimo||2}}, which had earlier fallen out of formation due to engine trouble, was caught and sunk by a detachment of aircraft from the ''[[USS San Jacinto (CVL-30)|USS San Jacinto]]''. The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to {{convert|24|knot|mph km/h}}, and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling ''Yamato''. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. ''Yahagi'' turned and raced away at {{convert|35|knot|mph km/h}} in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; although the manoeuvre was successful, the numbers it drew away were insignificant. ''Yamato'' avoided being hit for four minutes until, at 12:41, two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127&nbsp;mm mount. At 12:46 another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155&nbsp;mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great amount of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man climbed out alive.<ref name="G&D61"/>{{#tag:ref|This account is based on Garzke and Dulin's ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II''. Other works generally agree, although the exact timings of events can vary between sources.<ref name="G&D54"/>|group=N}} At 12:45 a single torpedo struck ''Yamato'' far forward on her port side sending extreme shocks throughout the ship. Because many of the hit's survivors were later killed by strafing or were trapped when ''Yamato'' sank, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused.<ref name="G&D61"/> Shortly afterward up to three more torpedoes struck home. Two impacts<U+2014>on the port side near the engine room and on one of the boiler rooms<U+2014>are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in ''Yamato''{{'}}s auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship to [[List (watercraft)|list]] {{degree|5<U+2013>6}} to port; counterflooding&mdash;deliberately flooding compartments on the other side of the ship&mdash;reduced the list to {{degree|1}}. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing ''Yamato''{{'}}s top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned ''Yamato''{{'}}s unprotected 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.<ref name="G&D61"/>

[[File:Yamato damaged 7 apr 1945.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large area of ocean with a warship in the middle distance.

The battleship is on fire and visibly listing to port.]]
The second attack started just before 13:00. In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo-laden aircraft approached from all directions at just above sea-level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were less than effective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. ''Yamato''{{'}}s main guns were loaded with Beehive shells fused to explode one second after firing<U+2014>a mere {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ship<U+2014>but this had little effect. Four or five torpedoes struck the battleship, three or four to port and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fireroom that had been hit earlier, one impacted a different fireroom, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a previously damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water that had already been flowing into that space and possibly causing flooding in nearby locations. The fourth hit (though unconfirmed) may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding that reportedly occurred in that location.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 62<U+2013>63.</ref> This attack left ''Yamato'' in a perilous position, listing {{degree|15<U+2013>18}} to port. Counterflooding all of the remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to {{degree|10}}, but further correction would have required either repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was in no danger of sinking at this point, the list meant that the main battery was unable to fire and her maximum speed was limited to {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 63.</ref>

The third and most damaging attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs damaged the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses damaged the ship by driving in her outer plating, partially compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water intake into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already underwater, the ship lost all maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was in the process of being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike increased the rate of water intake by a large margin, trapping many crewmen before they could escape.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 64<U+2013>65.</ref>

At 14:02 the order was belatedly given to abandon ship. By this time ''Yamato''{{'}}s speed had dropped to {{convert|10|knots}} and her list was steadily increasing. Fires were raging out of control in some sections of the ship and alarms had begun to sound on the bridge warning of critical temperatures in the forward main battery magazines.{{#tag:ref|Garzke and Dulin state in their 1985 account that the alarms were for the aft magazines. ''Yamato''{{'}}s wreck was discovered that same year and more detailed surveys were completed in 1999; these conclude that it was the fore magazines that exploded.

At 14:05 ''Yahagi'' sank, the victim of twelve bombs and seven torpedoes. At the same time a final flight of torpedo bombers attacked ''Yamato'' from her starboard side. Her list was now such that the torpedoes<U+2014>set to a depth of {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<U+2014>impacted on the bottom of her hull. The battleship continued her inexorable roll to port.<ref name=cfrecord/> By 14:20 the power went out and her remaining 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns began to drop into the sea. Three minutes later ''Yamato'' capsized. Her main 460&nbsp;mm turrets fell off, and as she rolled she created a suction that drew swimming crewmen back towards the ship. When the roll reached approximately {{degree|120}} one of the two bow magazines detonated in a tremendous explosion.<ref name="G&D65"/> The resulting [[mushroom cloud]]<U+2014>over {{convert|4|mi|km}} high<U+2014>was seen {{convert|100|mi|km}} away on [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]].<ref>Reynolds (1982), p. 169.</ref> ''Yamato'' sank rapidly, losing an estimated 3,055 of her 3,332 crew, including Vice-Admiral [[Seiichi It<U+014D>]], the fleet commander.<ref name=cfrecord/>{{#tag:ref|Garzke and Dulin give a slightly different number of 2,063 out of 2,332 lost.

From the time of their construction ''Yamato'' and her sister ''Musashi'' carried significant weight in Japanese culture. The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the [[Western Powers#The Colonial "West"|Western Powers]] and the United States in particular. [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the ships as "symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy."<ref>Evans and Peattie (1997), pp. 298, 378.</ref>

Decades after the war, ''Yamato'' was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese. Historically, the word "[[Yamato]]" was used as a poetic name for Japan; thus, its name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.<ref>Yoshida and Minear (1985), p. xvii; Evans and Peattie (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Skulski (2004), p. 7.</ref> In April 1968, a memorial tower was erected on Cape Inutabu in Japan's [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten-Go.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu/kamikaze/monuments/yamato/index.htm |title=Battleship Yamato Memorial Tower |author= Bill Gordon |date=27 March 2010 |accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> In October 1974, [[Leiji Matsumoto]] created a new television series, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning five feature films and two more TV series; as post-war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives, ''Yamato'' became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country's defeat in the war.<ref>Mizuno (2007), pp. 106, 110&ndash;111, 121&ndash;122.</ref><ref>Levi (1998), p. 72.</ref> Brought to the United States as ''Star Blazers'', the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market.<ref>Wright (2009), p. 99.</ref> The motif in ''Space Battleship Yamato'' was repeated in ''[[The Silent Service|Silent Service]]'', a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the Japan-US relationship. The crew of the main plot device, a nuclear-powered super submarine, mutinied and renamed their vessel to ''Yamato'', an allusion to the World War II battleship and the ideals it symbolises.<ref>Mizuno (2007), pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref>

In 2005, [[Toei Company|Toei]] released a 143-minute movie, ''[[Yamato (film)|Yamato]]'', to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II; [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] released special editions of scale models of the battleship in conjunction with the film's release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tamiya.com/japan/products/8966x_yamato/index.htm |title=<U+6226><U+8266><U+5927><U+548C><U+30FB><U+6620><U+753B><U+300C><U+7537><U+305F><U+3061><U+306E><U+5927><U+548C><U+FF0F>YAMATO<U+300D><U+7279><U+5225><U+4ED5><U+69D8> |date=14 December 2005 |publisher=[[Tamiya Corporation]] |language=Japanese |trans_title=Battleship Yamato&mdash;Special Edition for ''Yamato'' the Movie |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref> Based on a book of the same name, the film is a tale about the sailors aboard the doomed battleship and the concepts of honour and duty.
