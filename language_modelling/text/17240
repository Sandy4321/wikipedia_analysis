The '''San Juan Bautista School of Medicine (SJBSOM)''' is a [[Private university|private]] U.S. [[medical school]], located within the '''San Juan Bautista Medical Center''' in [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]], [[Puerto Rico]]. It formally opened its doors in 1978.

The school offers a four-year [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctor of Medicine Degree Program]] (M.D.) and a local [[Internship (medicine)|Transitional Year]] Program. The first two years of the curriculum are Basic Sciences Courses within the school campus and the last two years Clinical Sciences at the hospitals. Mostly, Spanish is spoken, but medicine is taught in both Spanish and English. The faculty is composed of experienced [[medical doctors]] and professors that integrate knowledge with practice. The school also offers programs in Nursing and Master in Public Health.

==History==
The San Juan Bautista School of Medicine (SJBSOM) was founded in 1978 in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. It's a non profit corporation, incorporated under the laws of the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]]. On June 22 of 1979, it was authorized by the [[Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico]] to offer studies pertinent to the M.D. degree. The Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico is the governmental agency with the responsibility to coordinate the efforts related to the higher education in Puerto Rico.

The Institution has continued to develop through the years, and it moved its facilities to the city of [[Caguas]] in 1988, one of the most important urban centers in Puerto Rico. Nearly 150,000 people live in this progressive city of Puerto Rico. Caguas is located in the East-Central region of the island, {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} south of San Juan the Capital City of Puerto Rico. Due to the short distance between Caguas and San Juan, it is accessible to ports and airport facilities, thus permitting the fast movement of people and merchandise.  This element facilitates commercial, industrial and tourism expansion activities. The commercial development effect of urban growth during the last twenty years has allowed the construction of shopping centers with modern amenities and installations.  Around the periphery of the city, arise modern, recreational, sports and cultural facilities which have been developed in recent years.

On February 1998, the [[Middle States Association]] (MSA), granted Candidacy for Accreditation Status to the School.  The self-study design was accepted and the School was authorized to start its self-study process in April 2001.  Thanks to this Candidacy, San Juan Bautista School of Medicine was certified on November 1998 to participate in the Title IV Program of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Federal Education]], specifically in the [[Federal Family Education Loan Program]]. Through the [[Puerto Rico Health Reform]], there was the opportunity of buying hospitals from the government.  The School of Medicine saw the possibility of growth and presented a proposal to buy Caguas' Regional Hospital, Dr. Eduardo Garrido Morales, and on July 1, 1999 took control over its operations under the name of San Juan Bautista Medical Center.  On June 2004, San Juan Bautista School of Medicine is accredited by the [[Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].  The Commission on Higher Education is an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation|Council for the Higher Education Accreditation]].  The school is also member of the Board of Medical Examiners of Puerto Rico.  

In 2006, the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its Legislative Assembly approved the act that creates the Regional Academic Medical Centers.  This act establish that the four medical schools in Puerto Rico will lead and coordinates the health services of a determined area of the island under an environment of health education and the integration of the community in the academic development of the medical students interns and residents.  The San Juan Bautista School of Medicine and its hospital the San Juan Bautista Medical Center, is part of these Academic Medical Center, serving the Central Region of Puerto Rico. (Regional Academic Medical Centers of Puerto Rico Act: ''Act 136 of 2006'').  

Up to June 2009, San Juan Bautista School of Medicine has graduated more than 1,000 medical doctors that have been integrated successfully to provide health care in Puerto Rico and abroad. Many students have also been able to continue graduate medical education or [[Residency (medicine)|residencies]] in Puerto Rico and in the United States.

This made San Juan Bautista the fourth LCME accredited medical school in Puerto Rico. LCME public announcement was: "At its June 5<U+2013>7, 2007 meeting, the LCME granted accreditation to the medical education program leading to the M.D. degree at the San Juan Bautista School of Medicine in Caguas, Puerto Rico. The decision to grant accreditation will take effect at the beginning of academic year 2007<U+2013>2008, and apply to all students enrolled in the M.D. program and taking coursework leading to the completion of the M.D. degree at that time."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lcme.org/sjbaccred.htm | publisher=LCME |title=San Juan Bautista School of Medicine Granted LCME Accreditation  | year=2007| accessdate=August 31, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/pressrel/2008/080229.htm | publisher=AAMC |title=Three New Medical Schools Join AAMC Membership  | year=2007| accessdate=August 31, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

As a result, it could no longer accept new students via the [[AMCAS]] applicaton process and its current fourth year medical students could not participate in the [[National Resident Matching Program]] (NRMP).<ref>{{cite web|last=Barzansky|first=Barbara|title=Letter to Yocasta Brugal, MD, President and Dean, San Juan Bautista School of Medicine from LCME|url=http://www.lcme.org/sjb3oct2011letter.pdf|publisher=Liaison Committee on Medical Education|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Information for San Juan Bautista School of Medicine Students and Applicants|url=https://www.aamc.org/students/sjb/|work=San Juan Bautista <U+2013> Students|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges|accessdate=October 31, 2011}}</ref> On October 12, 2011, the San Juan Bautista School of Medicine filed a federal [[lawsuit]] against the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]], [[American Medical Association]] and the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico|District Court of Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Escuela de Medicina San Juan Bautista, Inc. v.

However, rather than maintain the loss of accreditation, the panel instead placed the medical education program on probationary accreditation, pending the LCME's consideration of the results of a full survey visit to take place as previously scheduled on January 29 <U+2013> February 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/articles/2011/11/21/what-medical-school-probation-means-for-students | title=What Medical School Probation Means for Students | work=U.S. News | date=November 21, 2011 | accessdate=November 22, 2011 | author=Wecker, Menachem}}</ref>
