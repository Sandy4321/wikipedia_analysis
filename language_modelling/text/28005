'''Jena Six''' was the name given to a group of six [[African American|black]] teenagers who have been [[criminal charge|charged]] with the beating of Justin Barker, a [[White American|white]] student at [[Jena High School]] in [[Jena, Louisiana|Jena]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States]], on December 4, 2006. Barker was injured, but was released from the emergency room the same day.<ref name="wapo"/> He has since brought suit against members of the Jena Six, their parents, the school district, and others allegedly involved.<ref name="USA Today"/>

A number of events took place in and around Jena in the months preceding the Barker assault, which have been linked to an alleged escalation of racial tensions. These events included the hanging of [[noose]]s from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between several white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School.The incidents were often linked in the extensive news coverage regarding the Jena Six.<ref name = "NPR"/>

Six individuals (Robert Bailey, then aged 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; Jesse Ray Beard, then 14; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were [[arrest|arrested]] in the assault on Barker. One, Mychal Bell, was initially convicted as an adult of [[Assault#Aggravated_assault|aggravated battery]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit aggravated battery. His convictions were overturned on the ground that he should have been tried as a [[minor (law)|juvenile]]. Prior to a retrial in [[juvenile court]], he pled guilty to a reduced charge of [[battery (crime)|simple battery]]. The other five defendants still await [[Trial#Criminal_trial|trial]].<ref name = "Yeager"/>

The Jena Six case sparked protests by those viewing the arrests and subsequent charges, initially [[attempted murder|attempted second-degree murder]] (though later reduced), as excessive and racially discriminatory. The protesters believed that white Jena youths involved in other incidents were treated leniently. On September 20, 2007, between 10,000 and 20,000&nbsp;protesters marched on Jena in what was described as the "largest civil rights demonstration in years".<ref>{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Gallacher |title=Huge rally in small-town Louisiana |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7005866.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=Jena, Louisiana |date=September 21, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Maria |last=Newman |title=Jena, La. |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/national/usstatesterritoriesandpossessions/louisiana/jena/index.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> Related protests were held in other US cities on the same day.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Simmons |title="Jena 6" Protest at Justice Dept. |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/02/AR2007100202254.html |publisher=Associated Press via ''The Washington Post'' |location=Washington, D.C. |date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> Subsequent reactions include songs alluding to the Jena Six, a considerable number of editorials and opinion columns, and Congressional hearings.

==Background to the assault==
===Noose hanging===
[[Image:Rsz schoolpicture.gif|thumb|Jena High School]]
At [[Jena High School]], about 10% of students are black and more than 80% are white, reflecting the population of the city of Jena, which has about 3,000&nbsp;people.<ref name="cdata">{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Jena-Louisiana.html |title=Jena, Louisiana (LA) Detailed Profile |accessdate=2008-08-25 |year=2007 |publisher=City-data.com}}</ref> Some early reporting indicated that students of different races seldom sat together, although this has been disputed.<ref name="nowhitetree">{{cite news |first=Todd |last=Lewan |title=Black and White Becomes Gray in La.

A school assembly was held on August 31, 2006.

The following morning, nooses were discovered hanging from the tree. Reports differ as to whether there were three<ref name="NPR"/> or two.<ref name="nowhitetree"/> A black teacher described seeing both white and black students "playing with [the nooses], pulling on them, jump-swinging from them, and putting their heads through them" that same day.<ref name="nowhitetree"/> Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', stated that the nooses were actually a prank by three students aimed at white members of the school rodeo team, and that the school's investigating committee had concluded that "the three young teens had no knowledge that nooses symbolize the terrible legacy of the lynchings of countless blacks in American history."<ref name = "MediaMyths"/> The names of those who hung the nooses have not been publicly disclosed.

=== Repercussions ===
The school disciplinary process that followed is unclear. It has been reported that the principal learned that three white students were responsible and recommended [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]], that the [[board of education]] overruled his recommendation, and that school superintendent Roy Breithaupt agreed with the overruling. It was initially reported that the punishment was reduced to three days of in-school suspension.<ref name="wapo">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/03/AR2007080302098.html |title=La.

The school superintendent was quoted as saying, "Adolescents play pranks.

According to US Attorney Donald Washington, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigators and federal examiners of the crime found that the hanging of the nooses "had all the markings of a [[hate crime]]". However, it could not be prosecuted as such because it failed to meet federal standards for the teens to be certified as adults.<ref name="notrelated">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/19/jena.six.link/index.html |title=U.S. Attorney: Nooses, beating at Jena High not related |date=September 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=CNN}}</ref> District Attorney [[J.

Police were called to the school in the days after the noose incident.<ref name="whitlock"/> The principal took action by calling an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked [[La Salle Parish, Louisiana|La Salle Parish]] District Attorney J. Reed Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to his message. Walters warned the students "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life.

===School arson, fight, and confrontation===
On November 30, 2006, the main building of the high school was set on fire and burned down. Although it would be many months before the perpetrators were known, the news media widely cited the fire as a racially-charged event leading up to the assault on Barker.<ref name="NPR"/> On December 28, 2007, LaSalle Parish Sheriff-elect Scott Franklin announced that an investigation had shown that the fire was set in an effort to destroy grade records in the building and to close the school for a time. Six racially diverse male suspects (three juveniles and three adults) had been arrested, and two more adult males were being sought. Franklin indicated that the fire was not racially motivated, and had no connection to the Jena Six.<ref name="face charges"/>
[[Image:Gotta go.jpg|thumb|The "Gotta Go" convenience store outside Jena, Louisiana]]
On Friday, December 1, 2006, a private party was held at the Jena Fair Barn.<ref name="clearup"/> Bailey and four other black youths attempted to enter the party at about 11:00&nbsp;p.m. According to US Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already in attendance at the party. A white male, who was not a student, then jumped in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black students to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students.<ref name="clearup" /> Justin Sloan, a white male, was charged with [[battery (crime)|battery]] for his role in the fight and was put on [[probation]]. Bailey later stated that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head,<ref name="wapo"/> but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.<ref name="clearup"/>

The following day, another incident occurred at the Gotta Go convenience store, outside Jena in unincorporated LaSalle Parish, between Matt Windham and three black youths including Bailey.<ref name="lasupct">{{cite court |litigants=''State of Louisiana v.

Windham alleged that Bailey and his friends chased him, that he ran to get his gun, and that the students wrestled it away from him. According to the black students, as they left the convenience store, they were confronted by Windham with a shotgun. They stated they wrestled the gun away from him and fled the scene.

==Attack on Barker==
On December 4, 2006 17-year-old Justin Barker, a white Jena High School student, was assaulted at school by a group of black students. Superintendent Breithaupt described the fight as a "premeditated ambush and attack by six students against one. The victim attacked was beaten and kicked into a state of bloody unconsciousness."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cbs11tv.com/politics/jena.6.mychal.2.507349.html |publisher=CBS News |title=Jena Six teen to be freed on bail |date=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>
Barker was released after three hours of treatment and observation at a local emergency room for a concussion and an eye that had swollen shut.<ref name="wapo"/> The emergency physician's record shows that he also had injuries to his face, ears, and hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70916045 |title=Documents give details about fight |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=''The Town Talk'' |last=Brown |first=Abbey}}</ref> Nevertheless, he attended his school's Ring ceremony that evening.

At a [[Law Day]] luncheon on April 30, 2008, US Attorney Washington decried what he termed "distortion of several key facts" by supporters of the Jena Six, most notably the linking of the Barker assault to the noose hangings.<ref name=distort/> In July 2007, Washington had noted that of the more than 40&nbsp;statements taken regarding the assault, none mentioned the noose incident.<ref name="clearup"/> Walters likewise indicated there was no linkage between the noose incident and the beating. "When this case was brought to me and during our investigation and during the trial, there was no such linkage ever suggested. This compact story line has only been suggested after the fact."<ref name="notrelated"/> Although Washington believes that both the noose hangings and the Barker assault were symptoms of racial tension, he has also said that there was no apparent lingering anger after the noose hangings.<ref name=distort>{{cite news |title=U.S. Attorney: Critics in Jena Six case have distorted the facts |url=http://www.ktbs.com/news/U.S.-Attorney-Critics-in-Jena-Six-case-have-distorted-the-facts-11518/ |publisher=KTBS-3 |date=April 30, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-24}}</ref>

==Criminal cases==
Law enforcement arrested six students, eventually dubbed the "Jena Six", who were accused in the attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/04/bell.jena.six/ |publisher=CNN |title=Residents: Nooses spark school violence, divide town |accessdate=2007-09-04 |date=September 5, 2007 |author=McLaughlin, Eliott C. & [[Susan Roesgen|Roesgen, Susan]]}}</ref> Five of them (Robert Bailey, Jr., then 17; Mychal Bell, then 16; Carwin Jones, then 18; Bryant Purvis, then 17; and Theo Shaw, then 17) were charged with attempted murder.<ref name="lasupct"/> The sixth student, Jesse Ray Beard (also known as Jesse Rae Beard), was charged as a juvenile. Despite his age, Mychal Bell was charged as an adult.<ref name="overturn"/> This was due to Bell's previous [[criminal record]] and because Walters believed Bell initiated the attack.<ref name="releaseabc"/>

The jury found Bell guilty, and he faced the possibility of up to 22&nbsp;years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007.

==Media coverage==
===News coverage===
Initially, the Jena Six were largely ignored by the United States national media, though covered locally and within Louisiana. Both ''The Jena Times''<ref name="MediaMyths"/> and ''The Town Talk''<ref>{{cite news |title=Jena Six |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/70915030 |work=The Town Talk |date=September 3, 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> (a regional newspaper published in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]) covered the story from its inception.

===Columnists and editorials===
Many major editorial pages and columnists have been sympathetic to the supporters of the Jena Six and have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and to call for a renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published around the time of the Jena rally. ''[[The New York Post]]'', in a September 23, 2007 editorial, stated "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work."<ref name="nyposted">{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09232007/postopinion/editorials/the_jena_six.htm |title=The Jena Six |accessdate=2007-10-23 |date=September 23, 2007 |publisher=''New York Post''}}</ref> Byron Williams, writing on the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', was one of several to cite the [[Urban League]]'s 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48&nbsp;months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man.<ref name="ByronWilliams">{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/oldfashioned-southern-ju_b_65178.html |title=Old Fashioned Southern Justice in the Modern South |work=The Huffington Post |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |last=Williams |first=Byron}}</ref> Their report also stated that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to prison than a white male convicted of the same crime.<ref name="pbs">{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/july-dec07/jena_9-24.html |title=Jena Six Rally Highlights Racial Tensions |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |last=Miller |first=Talea |publisher=PBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2040080.htm |title=Jena 6 case sparks anti-racism protest |accessdate=2007-09-27 |date=September 21, 2007 |last=Landers |first=Kim |publisher=ABC News}}</ref><ref name="younge">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,2170644,00.html |title=Apart from the noose, this is an everyday story of modern America |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |last=Younge |first=Gary |publisher=''The Guardian''}}</ref><ref name="page">{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/09/injustice_is_bigger_than_jena.html |title=Injustice is bigger than the 'Jena 6' |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=2007-09-27 |last=Page |first=Clarence |authorlink=Clarence Page |publisher=''The Baltimore Sun'' via RealClearPolitics}}</ref> Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist [[Clarence Page]] wrote that "The best legacy for the Jena March 6&nbsp;would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears.

Other columnists have argued that inaccuracies in the media coverage unfairly tarnish the town and have led to a national overreaction. ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' columnist Heather MacDonald, while condemning the noose hangings as a "despicable provocation", expressed her view that "the media, the (race) advocates and pandering politicians have erupted in an outpouring of seeming joy at the alleged proof that America remains a racist country."<ref name="macdonald">{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-macdonald_30edi.ART.State.Edition1.4257c86.html |title=Don't make Jena out to be more than it is |last=Mac Donald |first=Heather |authorlink=Heather Mac Donald |accessdate=2007-10-24| work=The Dallas Morning News |date=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> In a column in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', [[Jason Whitlock]] drew attention to what he called factual inaccuracies in reporting of the story. He focused on the piece circulated by Bean to news outlets, "Bean's story is framed<U+2014>by his own admission<U+2014>as an indictment of the criminal justice system and the people in power in Jena and, therefore, the story is unfairly biased."<ref name="whitlock"/> Craig Franklin, assistant editor of ''The Jena Times'', who states that he is the only writer to have covered this story from its inception, wrote in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' "I have never before witnessed such a disgrace in professional journalism. Myths replaced facts&nbsp;... the truth about Jena will eventually be known."<ref name="MediaMyths">{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Franklin |title=Media myths about the Jena 6 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1024/p09s01-coop.html |work=The Christian Science Monitor |location=Jena, Louisiana |pages=1<U+2013>3 |date=October 24, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

== Public response==
The case has elicited allegations that the charges against the Jena Six were disproportionate and racially motivated. Supporters of the Jena Six circulated online petitions, raised money for legal defense, and held a demonstration in Jena on September 20, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc13.com/gulfcoastwest/vtm/news.apx.-content-articles-VTM-2007-09-20-0007.html |title=Thousands March to Decry Treatment of Jena Six |date=September 20, 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-22 |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

=== Artistic tributes ===
Multiple songs have been produced in response to the Jena Six case. [[John Mellencamp]] released a song and video called "Jena", with lyrics such as "Jena, take your nooses down" which gained considerable media attention, and which Mellencamp described as a "condemnation of racism."<ref name = "mellencamp">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299824,00.html |title=Louisiana mayor balks at Mellencamp 'Jena 6' protest song and video |accessdate=2008-09-02 |date=October 6, 2007 |publisher=Associated Press via Foxnews}}</ref> The video juxtaposes images of Jena, the high school, and the tree with video from the 1960s, including civil rights marchers and police beatings.

===Other reactions===
[[Image:Jena Six petition.JPG|thumb|right|A worker gathers petition signatures at a [[Los Angeles]] rally, October 2007.]]
Multiple online petitions have circulated calling for various actions in response to the Jena Six case. A petition created by online advocacy group [[Color of Change]], which had previously advocated for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], called for District Attorney Walters to drop all charges and for Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] to investigate his conduct.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorofchange.org/jena/main.html|title=Justice for the Jena 6 |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Color of Change}}</ref> The Color of Change petition had received 312,880&nbsp;signatures as of October 18, 2007.

A legal defense fund was established to pay attorney and other fees for the Jena Six. Color of Change raised more than $212,000, largely through online donations.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Garofoli |title=Louisiana's Jena Six beating case galvanizes S.F.'s 'black MoveOn' |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/09/22/MNEISAVOE.DTL |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle''|date=September 22, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://secure.colorofchange.org/jena_fund/info.html |title=How funds are managed |author=Color of Change |accessdate=2008-02-08 |publisher=Color of Change}}</ref> While the NAACP provided a link to the fund through its website,<ref name = "naacp"/> initially, the donation link on the NAACP Jena Six support page steered potential donors to the generic NAACP donation page, with no way to designate funds for the Jena Six.

In the months following the Jena Six rally, controversy arose about accounting and dispersal of the legal defense funds. Questions about the money were first sparked by photos posted on Robert Bailey's former [[MySpace]] account, which show him with quantities of hundred dollar bills stuffed in his mouth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetowntalk.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS/399990074 |title='Jena Six' notebook |accessdate=2007-11-10 |date=September 28, 2007 |publisher=''The Town Talk''}}</ref> The controversy grew significantly when radio host [[Michael Baisden]] accused Color of Change of being "shady" with their use of the funds.

On September 22, 2007, the [[FBI]] opened an investigation of a white supremacist website that listed the addresses of five of the Jena Six and the telephone numbers of some of their families "in case anyone wants to deliver justice". According to an FBI spokeswoman, the website "essentially called for their [[lynching]]".<ref name="FBIprobe"/> Civil rights advocate [[Al Sharpton]] has stated that some of the families have continuously received threatening and harassing phone calls.<ref name="FBIprobe">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/22/AR2007092201404.html?nav=rss_technology |title=FBI probes anti-Jena 6 Web page |accessdate=2007-09-25 |date=September 22, 2007 |last=Bohrer |first=Becky |publisher=Associated Press}}</ref>

==Developments since September 20 rally==
===Action by Members of Congress===
On September 25, 2007, Representative [[John Conyers]], Chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]], announced that he would hold congressional hearings on what he described as "the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in Jena, Louisiana", with the goal of pressuring the [[United States Department of Justice]] into taking action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/25/AR2007092501666.html |title=Lawmakers Seek Jena 6 Teen's Release |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=Associated Press via ''The Washington Post'' |last=Barrett |first=Devlin}}</ref> The hearing took place on October 16, 2007; Washington and Sharpton, among others, testified. Walters was invited to testify but declined. Most Republican members of the committee declined to attend.

On December 19, 2007, Representative Lee and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus called upon outgoing Louisiana Governor Blanco to pardon the Jena Six, stating that "we believe Mychal Bell and the Jena 6 have paid a sufficient debt to society for any transgressions they may have committed".<ref name = "pardonme"/> Blanco's office responded that she cannot grant pardons without a recommendation from the state Pardon Board, and no meeting of that body was scheduled during her remaining term of office. Walters commented that Lee's "passion for racial equality is admirable, but her grasp of the facts is not".<ref name = "pardonme"/> He indicated that the attack on Barker was not just a schoolyard fight "but rather an unprovoked, unforeseen assault on a young man who had nothing to do with the hanging of the nooses".<ref name = "pardonme">{{cite news |title=Black congressional members seek pardon for 'Jena Six' |url=http://www.kltv.com/Global/story.asp?S=7529253 |publisher=Associated Press |date=December 24, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Governor Blanco's term of office ended without any pardons being granted.

===Other developments===
On July 31, 2007, the school had the tree cut down.<ref name="wapo"/> School Board member Fowler said, "There's nothing positive about that old tree. It's all negative.
