'''Martin Francis Hogan''' (October 25, 1869 &ndash; August 15, 1923), nicknamed "The Indianapolis Ringer", was an [[England|Anglo]]-American [[right fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[Cincinnati Reds]] (1894) and [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] (1894&ndash;1895). After leaving the [[National League]], Hogan moved on to the [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] [[Indianapolis Hoosiers (minor league baseball)|Indianapolis Hoosiers]]. Some sources suggest he set a national [[baserunning]] record in the 1890s.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23">{{cite news

When his playing career ended, he worked as a minor league baseball [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]]. As a manager, Hogan groomed several [[pitcher]]s who excelled in the major leagues. He signed future stars [[Stan Coveleski]] and [[Sad Sam Jones|Sam Jones]] to their first professional contracts<ref name="roy">{{cite web | url = http://bioproj.sabr.org/bioproj.cfm?a=v&v=l&pid=2264&bid=1194 | first = Craig | last = Lammers | title = Roy Castleton | publisher = Society for American Baseball Research | accessdate = 2007-03-04}}</ref> and helped launch the career of [[Roy Castleton]], the first native of [[Utah]] to play in the major leagues.<ref name="roy"/> 

In 1912, Hogan was among a select group of veteran managers invited to participate in the [[United States Baseball League]], which was treated by the baseball establishment as an "outlaw league".<ref name="nyt-03-16-12">{{cite news| title = New York Not Yet Named In Outlaw League| work = The New York Times| date = March 16, 1912}}</ref><ref name="LA84">{{cite web | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/NASSH_Proceedings/NP1976/NP1976zi.pdf |format=PDF|first = Rudolf K. |last = Haerle |title = The United States Baseball League of 1912: A Case Study of Organizational Failure | publisher = LA84 Foundation | accessdate = 2009-01-22}}</ref> For reasons that are unclear, he did not actually manage a franchise in the short-lived alternative league<ref name="nyt-04-18-12">

== Early years ==
Hogan was born to Patrick J. Hogan, Sr., and his wife, the former Margaret Gillen, in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] industrial town of [[Wednesbury]], [[Staffordshire]], England.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/> When he was still a child, his parents, both natives of Ireland, relocated the family from England to Youngstown, Ohio, a steel-production center near the [[Pennsylvania]] border.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/>  Although Hogan is routinely identified as Anglo-American (given his English birth), baseball historians [[Joel Zoss]] and John Bowman wrote that he probably regarded himself as an Irish American.<ref name="zossbowman120">Zoss and Bowman (2004), p. 120.</ref>    

The Hogan family settled on Youngstown's near west side, in a working-class district known as Westlake's Crossing.<ref name="vindy-yo-02-08-1897">{{cite news

Hogan, Sr.'s obituary described him as "a great baseball fan", who "was as quick to appreciate a clever 'steal' or a 'heady' play as any one of the younger generation".<ref name="telegram-yo-07-16-09"/> 

While little is known about Martin Hogan's early years in Youngstown, there is evidence he was popular among local residents. His obituary referred to him as an individual "of pleasing personality" who "made many friends during his long residence in Youngstown".<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/> Another newspaper article described him as "a good fellow",<ref name="vindy-yo-05-03-05">{{cite news

At Indianapolis, Hogan led at the bat,<ref name="vindy-yo-05-17-1895"/> and contemporary sources indicate his performance improved.  "Marty Hogan, who is playing temporarily in middle field for the Indianapolis team of the western league...is covering himself in glory with his superb playing", the ''Vindicator'' reported on June 4, 1895.  "The Indianapolis Sentinel of May 31st says: Hogan made a great record at the bat yesterday morning", the newspaper added.  "One of the drives was for a home run and three of the hits were bunts".  In addition, the article credited Hogan with four runs, five base hits, and two put outs in a late morning game against a rival team from [[St. Paul, Minnesota]].<ref name="vindy-yo-06-04-1895">{{cite news 
  | title = Sporting News

He got five hits, one a home run, and his bunting was even cleverer than usual, and that is saying a great deal".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-04-1895"/>  The article concluded, "If he keeps up this gait, it will not be long before [St. Louis Browns owner Chris] [[Chris von der Ahe|Von der Ahe]] reclaims his pet".<ref name="vindy-yo-06-04-1895"/>  

Hogan's obituary stated that, at some point in his playing career, he set a record for [[baserunning]].<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/>  Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds.<ref name="baltimoresun200"/><ref name="worldalmanac1906"/><ref name="post">

In 1907, for instance, ''[[Washington Post]]'' sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that "Hogan was a great sprinter" but described his unofficial record as "out of reason".  Grillo, who argued that "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by [[International League|Eastern League]] player Wally Clement.<ref name="post"/>  An article published in the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record.

According to an article that appeared in '' Sporting Life'' in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4".  The retired player added: "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and I doubt if he could".  For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports.<ref name="sportinglife03-31-1906">

The article noted that the outfielder had "offered to match himself to run 100 yards for $500 a side against any player in the National League".<ref name="slmay21896"/>  Meanwhile, his batting evidently continued to improve.

The article added, "Dithridge is not to be sold to Zanesville, and he has informed Hogan that he will play with his team under no conditions whatever".

An article that appeared in ''The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times'' in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization.  "There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run", the paper reported.

In March 1912, organizers of a proposed United States Baseball League&ndash;described by members of the sports establishment as an "outlaw league"&ndash;met in New York City's Hotel Imperial.<ref name="nyt-03-16-12" /> The league is widely viewed as "a major precursor to the [[Federal League]] of 1914&ndash;1915".<ref name="LA84"/> Hogan, who attended the New York meeting, was named as manager of a [[Cincinnati]]-based franchise scheduled to compete in the league.<ref name="nyt-03-16-12"/> (The U.S. Baseball League also established teams in [[Chicago]], Cleveland, Pittsburgh, [[New York City|New York]], Reading, Pennsylvania; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]])<ref name="LA84"/> The following month, however, Hogan was evidently replaced by Hugh McKinnon, who was described in an April ''New York Times'' article as manager of the league's Cincinnati franchise.<ref name="nyt-04-18-12"/> An article that appeared in ''The New York Times'' several weeks earlier suggested that McKinnon was originally tapped as manager of the league's Washington franchise. The same article also pointed out that ex-major leaguer [[George Browne (baseball)|George Browne]] "had been approached by the Washington Club".<ref name="nyt-03-19-12">

}}</ref> In the end, Browne was named as head of the Washington team when McKinnon was appointed manager of the Cincinnati club.<ref name="nyt-04-18-12"/> While these developments shed some light on the outcome, the reasons for Hogan's replacement as manager of the Cincinnati franchise remain uncertain. 

In any event, the league did not survive for long. Sports historian Rudolf K. Haerle observed that the U.S. Baseball League "stressed the inherent 'good' of baseball for all individuals and communities, and indicated that it wished to conduct its business in the accepted capitalist style&ndash;free competition in the marketplace".<ref name="LA84"/> The new league, however, quickly incurred the scorn and hostility of the baseball establishment.<ref name="LA84"/> Burdened with weak leadership, limited financing, poor attendance, and a lack of skillful players, the U.S. Baseball League "folded after about one month of action".<ref name="LA84"/> In June 1912, when the league ceased operation, the Cincinnati team that Hogan was supposed to manage ranked fourth in the eight-team roster, earning 12 wins and 10 losses.<ref name="LA84"/>  The following year, former players of the Cincinnati club successfully sued the team's owner, John J. Ryan, for unpaid wages.<ref name="sportinglife02-22-13">

In November 1912, ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' reported that Hogan would once again manage a local minor league ball club.<ref name="vindy-yo-11-06-12">{{cite news

In November 1912, ''Sporting Life'' reported that the manager was still mulling his next move when he attended the annual meeting of the National Association in New York.  "Marty Hogan, the veteran minor league manager, who is known from end to end of the land as a developer of minor league talent and winner of pennants, could not bear to miss meeting his old friends", the paper stated.  "Marty wound up the season with Zanesville and has not definitely decided upon his plans for the coming season".<ref name="sportinglife11-23-12">

During Hogan's tenure as manager of the Zanesville Flood Sufferers, the club took advantage of at least one opportunity to test their skills against a major league club.  Sports writer Walter LeConte observed that, on June 15, 1913, the Zanesville team participated in an in-season [[exhibition game]] with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]].  When the umpire declared the game forfeited after a disagreement with Giants player [[Fred Merkle]], Hogan "ordered the game continued so the fans could see a 9-inning baseball game".  LeConte added that "Hogan even assumed umpiring duties and the game was then concluded". The Giants won the game, with a score of 5&ndash;4.<ref name="leconte"/>  Reliable information on the Zanesville club's overall performance is currently unavailable, but an Associated Press report indicated the team had disbanded by late July 1913.<ref name="nyt-07-20-13">

=== Fond du Lac Molls ===

On July 20, 1913, ''The New York Times'' reported that Hogan left Zanesville to manage a [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]] franchise in the Illinois-Wisconsin League.<ref name="nyt-07-20-13"/> According to the article, he planned to bring with him five players from the defunct Zanesville club.<ref name="nyt-07-20-13"/> Reliable information on the Fond du Lac Molls' overall performance is currently unavailable. 

In February 1914, ''Sporting Life'' reported that Hogan was considering a return to the Tri-State League.  "In a letter to a friend in Lancaster [Pennsylvania] the former Lancaster manager stated that the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] [New Jersey] Club was after him and that there was [sic] good prospects of both sides coming to terms," the paper stated.  "Marty is anxious to get back in the Tri-State, where he won fame as a manager".<ref name="sportinglife2-28-14">

Throughout his sports career, Hogan's pastimes included trap shooting.  In July 1911, when he was manager of the Lancaster Red Roses, ''Sporting Life'' reported, "Marty shoots targets very well and can be looked to for high scores once he gets a little shooting".<ref name="sportinglife7-22-11">{{cite news

== Final years ==
In the mid-1910s, Hogan permanently resettled in Youngstown, where he became athletic director of Thomas Field, a ballpark owned by the local [[Brier Hill]] Industrial Works.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/>  Prior to the enforcement of the [[Volstead Act]], he was also employed as a clerk at Buckley & Hogan, a downtown saloon operated by his older brother, Patrick J. Hogan, Jr., and his business partner, John J. Buckley, Sr.<ref>''Youngstown City Directory'' (Akron, OH: Burch Directory Co., 1917).</ref>  Further research will be required to determine Martin Hogan's level of involvement, if any, in local baseball during the last decade of his life.   

Martin F. Hogan was only 54 years old when he died at his north side home from injuries sustained months earlier in an auto accident.  Several blood transfusions failed to revive him, and a bout with pneumonia proved fatal. Funeral services for Hogan were held at St. Columba Church, and he was buried at Youngstown's [[Calvary]] Cemetery.  His wife, Agnes, survived him along with his brother, Patrick.  A sister, Mrs. John Dillon, had died several years earlier.  Hogan's obituary in ''The Youngstown Daily Vindicator'' highlighted his contributions to organized sports, observing that many young athletes he trained and managed went on to careers in major league baseball.<ref name="vindy-yo-08-17-23"/>  Major league players who worked with Hogan during his years as a minor league manager included Roy Castleton,<ref name="roy"/> Stan Coveleski,<ref name="roy"/> Lee Fohl,<ref name="sportinglife12-16-05"/> Sam Jones,<ref name="roy"/> Billy Phyle,<ref name="sportinglife12-16-05"/> and Louis Schettler.<ref name="sportinglife12-16-05"/>  His disputed baserunning record remains a curious footnote in American baseball history.<ref name="evar"/>
