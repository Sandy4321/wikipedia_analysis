[[Northern Ireland]] has a literary tradition in English, [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]. Irish writers have also played an important part in the development of English-language literature.

Literature in the [[Celtic languages]] of the islands is the oldest surviving [[vernacular literature]] in [[Europe]]. The Welsh literary tradition stretches from the 6th century to the 21st century. The oldest Welsh literature does not belong to the territory we know as Wales today, but rather to [[Yr Hen Ogledd|northern England and southern Scotland]]. But though it is dated to be from the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries, it has survived only in 13th- and 14th-century [[manuscript]] copies.

==Latin literature==
{{main|British literature in Latin}}
[[Chronicle]]rs such as [[Bede]], with his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', and [[Gildas]], with his ''[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]'', were figures in the development of indigenous [[Latin literature]], mostly ecclesiastical, in the centuries following the withdrawal of the Roman Empire. 

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' composed in the 9th century is traditionally ascribed to [[Nennius]]. It is the earliest source which presents [[King Arthur]] as a historical figure, and is the source of several stories which were repeated and amplified by later authors.

[[Adomn<U+00E1>n]]'s most important work is the ''[[Vita Columbae]]'', a hagiography of [[Columba]], and the most important surviving work written in early medieval Scotland. It is a vital source for knowledge of the [[Picts]], as well as an insight into the life of [[Iona Abbey]] and the early medieval Gaelic monk. The vita of Columba contains a story that has been interpreted as the first reference to the [[Loch Ness Monster]].

==Early Celtic literature==

For a comparatively small country, Ireland has made a large contribution to [[world literature]] in all its branches. The [[Irish literature]] that is best known outside the country is in English, but the [[Irish language]] also has the most significant body of written literature, both ancient and recent, in any Celtic language, in addition to a strong [[orature|oral tradition]] of legends and poetry. 

The [[Ulster Cycle]] written in the 12th century,  is a body of medieval Irish heroic legends and sagas of the traditional heroes of the [[Ulaid]] in what is now eastern [[Ulster]] and northern [[Leinster]], particularly counties [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Louth|Louth]]. The stories are written in [[Old Irish|Old]] and [[Middle Irish]], mostly in prose, interspersed with occasional verse passages. The language of the earliest stories is dateable to the 8th century, and events and characters are referred to in poems dating to the 7th.<ref>Garret Olmsted, "The Earliest Narrative Version of the ''T<U+00E1>in'': Seventh-century poetic references to ''T<U+00E1>in b<U+00F3> C<U+00FA>ailnge''", Emania 10, 1992, pp. 5<U+2013>17</ref>

In [[Medieval Welsh literature]] the period before 1100 is known as the period of ''Y Cynfeirdd'' ("The earliest poets") or ''Yr Hengerdd'' ("The old poetry"). It roughly dates from the birth of the Welsh language until the arrival of the [[Normans]] in Wales towards the end of the 11th century.

The stories of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' appear in either or both of two Medieval Welsh manuscripts, the [[White Book of Rhydderch]] (''Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch'') written ca. 1350, and the [[Red Book of Hergest]] (''Llyfr Coch Hergest'') written about 1382<U+2013>1410, although texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later manuscripts. Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing manuscripts, but disagree over just how much older.

Gaelic literature in Scotland includes a celebration, attributed to the Irish monk Adomn<U+00E1>n, of the Pictish King [[Bridei III of the Picts|Bridei]]'s (671-93) victory of the Northumbrians at the [[Battle of Dunnichen]] (685).

==Old English literature 449<U+2013>1066==
{{main|Old English literature}}
[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|left|170px|thumb|[[Beowulf]]]]

The earliest form of [[English literature]] developed after the settlement of the [[Saxon people|Saxons]] and other Germanic tribes in England after the withdrawal of the Romans and is known as [[Old English language|Old English]] or Anglo-Saxon.
 
[[C<U+00E6>dmon]] is the earliest [[English people|English]] poet whose name is known. C<U+00E6>dmon's only known surviving work is ''C<U+00E6>dmon's Hymn'', probably dating from the late 7th century. The poem is one of the earliest attested examples of Old English and is, with the [[runic]] [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Franks Casket]] inscriptions, one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of Old English poetry. It is also one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]].

The [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is the most famous work in Old English. A hero of the Geats, Beowulf battles three [[antagonist]]s: [[Grendel]], [[Grendel's mother]], and a [[Dragon]]. The only surviving manuscript is the [[Nowell Codex]]. The precise date of the manuscript is debated, but most estimates place it close to the year 1000.

[[Chronicle]]s contained a range of historical and literary accounts; one notable example is the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' which contains various heroic poems inserted throughout.

The Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity after their arrival in England. A popular poem, ''[[The Dream of the Rood]]'', was inscribed upon the Ruthwell Cross. ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]'' is a retelling of the story found in the Latin Bible's [[Book of Judith]] of the beheader of the Assyrian general Holofernes. The ''[[Old English Martyrology]]'' is a [[Mercia]]n collection of hagiographies. [[<U+00C6>lfric of Eynsham]] was a prolific 10th century writer of hagiographies and homilies.

==Late medieval literature==
[[Image:Bedivere.jpg|thumb|205px|[[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] casts [[King Arthur]]'s sword [[Excalibur]] back to the [[Lady of the Lake]]. The [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian Cycle]] has influenced British literature across languages and down the centuries.]]

The linguistic diversity of the islands in the medieval period, with each of the languages producing literatures at various times which contributed to the rich variety of artistic production, made British literature distinctive and innovative.<ref name=Companion>''Language and Literature'', Ian Short, in ''A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'', edited Christopher Harper-Bill and Elisabeth van Houts, Woodbridge 2003, ISBN 0851156738</ref>

Latin literature circulated among the educated classes. [[Gerald of Wales]]'s most distinguished works are those dealing with Wales and Ireland, with his late 12th century two books in Latin on his beloved Wales the most important: ''Itinerarium Cambriae'' and ''Descriptio Cambriae'' which tell us much about Welsh history and geography.

Following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, the development of [[Anglo-Norman literature]] in the Anglo-Norman realm introduced literary trends from [[Continental Europe]] such as the ''[[chanson de geste]]''. However, the indigenous development of Anglo-Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental [[O<U+00EF>l languages|O<U+00EF>l]] literature: [[Geoffrey Gaimar]] produced the earliest rhymed chronicle; Benedeit, the earliest adventure narrative inspired by Celtic sources; [[Jordan Fantosme]], the earliest eyewitness historiography; Philippe de Thaun, the earliest scientific literature.<ref name=Companion />

Religious literature continued to enjoy popularity. [[hagiography|Hagiographies]] continued to be written, adapted and translated: for example, ''[[The Life of Saint Audrey]]'', [[Eadmer]]'s contemporary biography of [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and the ''[[South English Legendary]]''.

The [[Roman de Fergus]] was the earliest piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to come from Scotland. As the Norman nobles of Scotland assimilated to indigenous culture they commissioned Scots versions of popular continental romances, for example: ''Launcelot o the Laik'' and ''The Buik o Alexander''. 

While chroniclers such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and [[Henry of Huntingdon]] attempted to weave such historical information they had access to into coherent narratives, other writers took more creative approaches to their material.<ref name="wace">''Wace's Roman de Brut <U+2013> A History of the British'', Weiss, Exeter 1999, ISBN 0-85989-734-6</ref>

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] was one of the major figures in the [[English historians in the Middle Ages|development of British history]] and the popularity for the tales of [[King Arthur]]. He is best known for his chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (History of the Kings of Britain) of 1136, which spread Celtic motifs to a wider audience, including accounts of Arthur's father [[Uther Pendragon]], wizard [[Merlin]], and sword Caliburnus (named as [[Excalibur]] in some manuscripts of Wace).

''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' is a Welsh tale about a hero connected with Arthur and his warriors, and is the longest of the surviving Welsh prose tales. It is perhaps the earliest extant Arthurian tale and one of Wales' earliest extant prose texts.
[[Image:Wace monument St Helier Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wace]], the earliest known Jersey poet, developed the [[Arthurian legend]] and chronicled the Dukes of Normandy]]
The 12th century [[Jersey]] poet [[Wace]] is considered the founder of Jersey literature and contributed to the development of the Arthurian legend in British literature. His ''[[Roman de Brut|Brut]]'' showed the interest of Norman patrons in the mythologising of the new English territories of the Anglo-Norman realm by building on Geoffrey of Monmouth's History, and introduced King Arthur's [[Round Table]] to literature. His ''[[Roman de Rou]]'' placed the [[Dukes of Normandy]] within an epic context.<ref name="wace"/>

The ''[[Prophecy of Merlin]]'' is a 12th-century poem written in Latin [[hexameter]]s by [[John of Cornwall (theologian)|John of Cornwall]], which he claimed was based or revived from a lost manuscript in the [[Cornish language]]. [[Marginalia|Marginal notes]] on Cornish vocabulary are among the earliest known writings in the Cornish language.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Literature'', Volume 1 By Joseph T. Shipley (page 176) here [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jtmASIRhosAC&pg=PA176&dq=John+of+Cornwall's+Seven+Kings&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=&f=false]</ref>

At the end of the 12th century, [[Layamon]]'s ''[[Layamon's Brut|Brut]]'' adapted Wace to make the first English language work to discuss the legends of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It was also the first historiography written in English since the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. 

The ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' is a short chronicle of the [[Kings of Scots|Kings]] of [[Alba]]. It was written in [[Hiberno-Latin]] but displays some knowledge of contemporary [[Middle Irish language|Middle Irish]] [[orthography]] and probably put together in the early 13th century by the man who wrote ''[[de Situ Albanie]]''. The original text was without doubt written in Scotland, probably in the early 11th century, shortly after the reign of [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth II]], the last reign it relates. 

[[Early English Jewish literature]] developed after the Norman Conquest with Jewish settlement in England. [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] is known chiefly as the author of a 13th century set of over a hundred fables, called ''Mishle Shualim'', (Fox Fables), which are derived from both Berachyah's own inventions and some borrowed and reworked from [[Aesop]]'s fables, the Talmud, and the Hindus.<ref name="Adventures in Philosophy">[http://www.radicalacademy.com/adiphiljewish2.htm#Berachyah Adventures in Philosophy: A Brief History of Jewish Philosophy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The collection also contains fables conveying the same plots and morals as those of [[Marie de France]]. The development of Jewish literature in mediaeval England ended with the [[Edict of Expulsion]] of 1290.

[[Matthew Paris]] wrote a number of works in the 13th century. Some were written in Latin, some in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] or [[medieval French|French]] verse. His ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' is an oft-cited historical source.

In the later medieval period a new form of English now known as [[Middle English]] evolved. This is the earliest form which is comprehensible to modern readers and listeners, albeit not easily. [[Middle English Bible translations]], notably [[Wyclif's Bible]], helped to establish English as a literary language. Romances appear in English from the 13th century, with ''[[King Horn]]'' and ''[[Havelock the Dane]]'', based on Anglo-Norman originals such as the ''[[Romance of Horn]]''.<ref name=Companion />

[[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' is considered by many critics to be one of the early great works of English literature along with Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' (most likely by the [[Pearl Poet]]) during the Middle Ages. It is also the first allusion to a literary tradition of the legendary English [[archery|archer]], [[swordsman]], and [[outlaw]] [[Robin Hood]].
[[Image:Geoffrey Chaucer (17th century).jpg|185px|thumb|left|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], father of English literature]]
The most significant Middle English author was [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] who was active in the late 14th century. Often regarded as the father of [[English literature]], Chaucer is widely credited as the first author to demonstrate the artistic legitimacy of the [[vernacular]] [[English language]], rather than French or Latin. ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' was Chaucer's [[magnum opus]], and a towering achievement of [[Western culture]]. The first recorded association of [[Valentine's Day]] with [[romantic love]] is in Chaucer's ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' 1382,<ref>Oruch, Jack B., "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February," ''Speculum,'' '''56''' (1981): 534<U+2013>65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be "the original mythmaker in this instance." [http://colfa.utsa.edu/chaucer/ec23.html Colfa.utsa.edu]</ref> and sending [[Valentine's Day#Modern times|Valentine's Day]] [[greeting card|cards]] became hugely popular in Britain in the late 18th century, a practice that has since spread to other nations.<ref>[http://www.ummah.net/Al_adaab/dawah/valentines.html Ummah.net]</ref><ref>[http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/vals.html Emotionscards.com]</ref>

The multilingual audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of [[John Gower]], who wrote in Latin, Middle English and Anglo-Norman.

Women writers were also active, such as Marie de France in the 12th century and [[Julian of Norwich]] in the early 14th century. Julian's ''[[Revelations of Divine Love]]'' (circa 1393) is believed to be the first published book written by a woman in the English language.<ref name="ec">{{cite book

</ref> [[Margery Kempe]] (c. 1373 &ndash; after 1438) is known for writing ''The Book of Margery Kempe'', a work considered by some to be the first [[autobiography]] in the English language, which chronicles, to some extent, her extensive [[pilgrimage]]s to various holy sites in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

[[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]'s main themes were love and nature. The influence of wider European ideas of [[courtly love]], as exemplified in the [[troubadour]] poetry of [[Provence|Proven<U+00E7>al]], is seen as a significant influence on Dafydd's poetry. He was an innovative poet who was responsible for popularising the metre known as the "[[cywydd]]" and first to use it for praise. But perhaps his greatest innovation was to make himself the main focus of his poetry. By its very nature, most of the work of the traditional Welsh court poets kept their own personalities far from their poetry. Dafydd's work is full of his own feelings and experiences.

Since at least the 14th century, poetry in English has been written in Ireland and by Irish writers abroad. The earliest poem in English by a Welsh poet dates from about 1470. The Latin and English poem ''[[Flen flyys]]'' written around 1475, is chiefly famous for containing in coded form the first known written usage in English of a particular [[fuck|profane term]] in the English language. 

Among the earliest [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] literature is [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour's]] ''[[The Brus|Brus]]'' (14th century). [[Andrew of Wyntoun|Whyntoun]]'s ''Kronykil'' and [[Blind Harry|Blind Harry's]] ''Wallace'' date from the (15th century). From the 13th century much literature based around the [[List of monarchs of Scotland|royal court]] in [[Edinburgh]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] was produced by writers such as [[Robert Henryson|Henrysoun]], [[William Dunbar|Dunbar]], [[Gavin Douglas|Douglas]] and [[David Lyndsay|Lyndsay]]. The works of [[Chaucer's influence on fifteenth-century Scottish literature|Chaucer had an influence on Scottish writers]].

In the [[Cornish language]] ''Passhyon agan Arloedh'' ("The Passion of our Lord"), a poem of 259 eight-line verses written in 1375, is one of the earliest surviving works of [[Cornish literature]]. The most important work of literature surviving from the Middle Cornish period is ''An Ordinale Kernewek'' ("The Cornish [[Ordinalia]]"), a 9000-line religious [[drama]] composed around the year 1400. The longest single surviving work of Cornish literature is ''[[Bywnans Meriasek]]'' (The Life of Meriasek), a play dated 1504, but probably copied from an earlier manuscript. 

''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', is Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s 15th century compilation of some French and English Arthurian romances, was among the earliest books printed in England, and was influential in the later revival of interest in the Arthurian legends.

[[Image:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Thomas More]] book ''[[Utopia]]'', illustration of imaginary island, 1516]]
[[Sir Thomas More]] coined the word "[[utopia]]", a name he gave to the ideal, imaginary island nation whose political system he described in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', written in Latin and published in 1516.

The landmark work in the reign of [[James IV of Scotland]] was [[Gavin Douglas]]'s ''[[Eneados]]'', the first complete translation of a major classical text in an [[Anglic language|Anglian]] language, finished in 1513. Its reception however was overshadowed by the [[Battle of Flodden Field|Flodden]] defeat that same year, and the political instability that followed in the kingdom. Another major work, [[David Lyndsay]]'s ''[[Ane Pleasant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis]]'', later in the century, is a surviving example of a dramatic tradition in the period that has otherwise largely been lost. At the end of the 16th century, [[James VI of Scotland]] founded the [[Castalian Band]], a group of [[makar]]s and musicians in the court, based on the model of the [[Pl<U+00E9>iade]] in France. The courtier and makar [[Alexander Montgomerie]] was a leading member. However this cultural centre was lost after the 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]] when James [[Stuart London|shifted his court to London]]. From 1603, London was the unrivalled cultural capital of the isles.

[[Image:Shakespeare.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[William Shakespeare]]'s career straddled the change of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart dynasties]] and encompassed English history and the emerging imperial idea of the 17th century]]
The [[English Renaissance]] dated from the early 16th century to the early 17th century. The [[sonnet]] form and other Italian literary influences arrived in English literature. The sonnet was introduced into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] in the early 16th century. 

In the later 16th century English poetry was characterised by elaboration of language and extensive allusion to classical myths. The most important poets of this period included [[Edmund Spenser]] and [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]].

[[English Renaissance theatre]] was among the most important literary achievements of the [[English Renaissance]]. [[William Shakespeare]], widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language, wrote over [[Shakespeare's plays|35 plays]] in several genres, including [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedy]], [[Shakespearean comedy|comedy]] and [[Shakespearean history|history]]. Other major playwrights of the time included [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], and [[Thomas Kyd]].

[[Image:John Milton - Project Gutenberg eText 13619.jpg|thumb|174px|[[John Milton]], religious [[epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' published in 1667.]]
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the translation of [[liturgy]] and [[Bible]] into vernacular languages provided new literary models. The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the ''[[Authorized King James Version]]'' of the Bible have been hugely influential. The King James Bible as one of the biggest translation projects in the history of English up to this time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. It represents the culmination of a tradition of [[English translations of the Bible|Bible translation into English]] from the original languages that began with the work of [[William Tyndale]] (previous translations into English had relied on the [[Vulgate]]). It became the standard [[Bible]] of the [[Church of England]], and some consider it one of the greatest literary works of all time. 

Philosopher [[Sir Francis Bacon]] wrote the [[utopian novel]] ''[[New Atlantis]]'', and coined the phrase "''[[Knowledge is Power]]''".

The prolific Jacobean playwright and poet [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[The Revenger's Tragedy]]'', is an early example of [[illegitimacy in fiction]]. Other Jacobean playwrights include [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[John Webster]].

English poets of the early 17th century are crudely classified by the division into [[Cavalier poet]]s and [[metaphysical poets]], the latter being much concerned with religion. The division is therefore along a line approximating to secular/religious.
Major poets of the 17th century included [[John Donne]], [[Andrew Marvell]], and [[George Herbert]]. [[Thomas Carew]] was among poets who wrote [[country house poem]]s. [[John Milton]]'s 1644 ''[[Areopagitica]]'', is an influential and impassioned philosophical defence of the principle of a right to [[freedom of speech]], written in opposition to licensing and censorship, as an eloquent defence of [[press freedom]]. Milton's religious epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was first published in 1667.

Their works are among the most important [[primary source]]s for the [[English Restoration]] period, and consists of [[witness|eyewitness]] accounts of many great events, such as the [[Great Plague of London]], and the [[Great Fire of London]].

The publication of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' in 1678, established the theologian [[John Bunyan]] as a notable writer.

A seminal book in piracy, ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'' 1724, was published in London, and contained biographies of several notorious English pirates such as [[Blackbeard]] and [[Calico Jack]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5ou7Bm11IgEC&pg=PR7&dq=Charles+Johnson+(1724),+A+General+History+of+the+Robberies+and+Murders+of+the+Most+Notorious+Pyrates&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Charles%20Johnson%20(1724)%2C%20A%20General%20History%20of%20the%20Robberies%20and%20Murders%20of%20the%20Most%20Notorious%20Pyrates&f=false ''A general history of the robberies & murders of the most notorious pirates''.

The early 18th century is known as the Augustan Age of English literature. The poetry of the time was highly formal, as exemplified by the works of [[Alexander Pope]].

The English pictorial [[satire|satirist]] and editorial [[cartoonist]] [[William Hogarth]] emerged In the 18th century, who has been credited with pioneering western [[sequential art]]. His work ranged from [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] portraiture to [[comic strip]]-like series of pictures called "modern moral subjects". Much of his work poked fun at contemporary politics and customs; illustrations in such style are often referred to as "Hogarthian".<ref>[http://www.britishmuseumshoponline.org/invt/brimus068?stylecat=art_prints The British Museum.

Although documented history of [[Irish theatre]] began at least as early as 1601, the earliest Irish dramatists of note were [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]], one of the most interesting writers of [[Restoration comedy|Restoration comedies]], and [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage in the 18th century.

The [[Graveyard Poets]] were a number of pre-Romantic English poets of the 18th century characterised by their gloomy meditations on mortality, 'skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms' in the context of the graveyard.  To this was added, by later practitioners, a feeling for the [[Sublime (philosophy)|'sublime']] and uncanny, and an interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry. They are often considered precursors of the Gothic genre, and poets include; [[Thomas Gray]], [[William Cowper]], [[Christopher Smart]], [[Thomas Chatterton]], and [[Edward Young]].

The question of identifying the [[first novel in English]] is a subject of academic discussion. The [[English novel]] developed during the 18th century, partly in response to an expansion of the [[middle-class]] reading public. One of the major early works in this genre was the seminal [[castaway]] novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' by [[Daniel Defoe]]. The 18th century novel tended to be loosely structured and semi-comic. [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' is considered a [[comic novel|comic]] masterpiece. [[Samuel Richardson]] is known for his three [[epistolary novel]]s: ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela: Or, Virtue Rewarded]]'' 1740, ''[[Clarissa|Clarissa: Or the History of a Young Lady]]'' 1748 and ''[[The History of Sir Charles Grandison]]'' 1753. Novelists from the mid-to-late 18th century include; [[Laurence Sterne]],  [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[Tobias Smollett]], who influenced [[Charles Dickens]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Literature 1640<U+2013>1789: An Anthology |author= Robert DeMaria|year= 2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-21769-X|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

[[Image:Jonathan Swift by Charles Jervas detail.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Jonathan Swift]]]]
Although the epics of Celtic Ireland were written in prose and not verse, most people would probably consider that Irish fiction proper begins in the 18th century with the works of [[Jonathan Swift]], notably ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' 1726, and [[Oliver Goldsmith]], with his best known novel ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' 1766.

[[Edward Cave]] created the first general-interest magazine with ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He was the first to use the term "[[magazine]]" on the analogy of a military storehouse of varied material. 

[[John Newbery]] made [[children's literature]] a sustainable and profitable part of the literary market, and he published his most popular story ''[[The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes]]'' in 1765.

[[Horace Walpole]]'s 1764 novel ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', invented the [[Gothic fiction]] genre, that combines elements of [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[Romance (genre)|romance]]. The pioneering gothic novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] introduced the brooding figure of the gothic [[villain]] which developed into the [[Byronic hero]]. Her most popular and influential work ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' 1794, is frequently cited as the archetypal Gothic novel. ''[[Vathek]]'' 1786 by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], and ''[[The Monk]]'' 1796 by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], were further notable early works in both the gothic and horror literary genres.

==Non English-language literatures from the 16th century to the 19th century==
[[Image:Robert Burns 1.jpg|thumb|185px|[[Robert Burns]] inspired many vernacular writers across the Isles with works such as ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'', ''[[A Red, Red Rose]]'' and ''[[Halloween (poem)|Halloween]]''.]]
 
The earliest datable text in [[Manx language|Manx]] (preserved in 18th century manuscripts), a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of [[Christianity]], dates to the 16th century at the latest.

The first book to be printed in Welsh was published in 1546. From the Reformation until the 19th century most literature in the Welsh language was religious in character. [[Morgan Llwyd]]'s  ''Llyfr y Tri Aderyn'' ("The Book of the Three Birds") (1653) took the form of a dialogue between an eagle (representing [[secular]] authority, particularly Cromwell); a dove (representing the Puritans); and a raven (representing the [[Church of England|Anglican]] establishment). 

Chaucerian, classical and French [[literary language]] continued to influence Scots literature up until the Reformation. [[The Complaynt of Scotland]] shows the interplay of language and ideas between the kingdoms of Scotland and England in the years leading up to the [[Union of the Crowns]].

The earliest surviving examples of Cornish prose are ''Pregothow Treger'' (The Tregear Homilies) a set of 66 [[sermon]]s translated from English by John Tregear 1555<U+2013>1557. [[Nicholas Boson]] (1624<U+2013>1708) wrote three significant texts in Cornish, ''Nebbaz gerriau dro tho Carnoack'' (A Few Words about Cornish) between 1675 and 1708; ''Jowan Chy-an-Horth, py, An try foynt a skyans'' (John of Chyannor, or, The three points of wisdom), published by [[Edward Lhuyd]] in 1707, though written earlier; and ''The Dutchess of Cornwall's Progress'', partly in English, now known only in fragments. The first two are the only known surviving Cornish prose texts from the 17th century.<ref>''The Cornish writings of the Boson family: Nicholas, Thomas and John Boson, of Newlyn, circa 1660 to 1730'', Edited with translations and notes by O. J. Padel (Redruth: Institute of Cornish Studies, 1975) ISBN  0903686090</ref>

[[Ellis Wynne]]'s ''Gweledigaetheu y Bardd Cwsc'' ('Visions of the Sleeping Bard'), first published in London in 1703, is regarded as a Welsh language classic. It is generally said that no better model exists of such 'pure' idiomatic Welsh, before writers had become influenced by English style and method.

The first printed work in Manx dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book [[catechism]] in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson. The [[Book of Common Prayer]] and [[Bible]] were translated into Manx in the 17th and 18th centuries. A tradition of ''carvals'', religious songs or [[Carol (music)|carols]], developed. Religious literature was common, but secular writing much rarer. 

In Scotland, after the 17th century, [[anglicisation]] increased, though Lowland Scots was still spoken by the vast majority of the population. At the time, many of the oral [[Border ballads|ballads from the borders]] and the North East were written down. Writers of the period include [[Robert Sempill]] (c.1595<U+2013>1665), Lady Wardlaw and Lady [[Grizel Baillie]].

In the [[Scots language|Scots]]-speaking areas of [[Ulster]] there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. [[Alexander Montgomerie]]'s ''The Cherrie and the Slae'' in 1700, shortly over a decade later an edition of poems by [[Sir David Lindsay]], nine printings of [[Allan Ramsay (1686<U+2013>1758)|Allan Ramsay]]'s ''The Gentle shepherd'' between 1743 and 1793, and an edition of [[Robert Burns]]' poetry in 1787, the same year as the Edinburgh edition, followed by reprints in 1789, 1793 and 1800. Among other Scottish poets published in Ulster were [[James Hogg]] and [[Robert Tannahill]]. In 1780, [[Dumfries]] poet [[John Mayne]] makes note of pranks at Halloween; ''"What fearfu' pranks ensue!"'', as well as the supernatural associated with the night, ''"Bogies"'' (ghosts).<ref name=CHM>Robert Chambers [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdVkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA154&dq=halloween+poem+(burns)&hl=en&ei=YaX2TI2CH4uwhQfP_8GKCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=halloween%20poem%20(burns)&f=false The life and works of Robert Burns, Volume 1] Lippincott, Grambo & co., 1854 </ref> Robert Burns' 1785 poem ''[[Halloween (poem)|Halloween]]'' is recited by Scots at Halloween, and Burns was influenced by Mayne's composition.<ref>Thomas Crawford [http://books.google.com/books?id=BDCsAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA125&dq=scottish+halloween+traditions+-+burns+poem&hl=en&ei=_qv2TKz9EIyIhQee78ShAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false Burns: a study of the poems and songs] Stanford University Press, 1960</ref><ref name=CHM/>

In the 18th century, Scottish writers such as Ramsay, [[Robert Fergusson]], Robert Burns and [[Sir Walter Scott]] continued to use Lowland Scots. Scott introduced vernacular dialogue to his novels. The [[Habbie stanza]] was developed as a poetic form.

[[Iolo Morganwg]], founder of the [[Gorsedd]], first came to public notice in 1789 when he produced ''Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym'', a collection of the poetry of the 14th-century [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]]. Included in this edition was a large number of previously unknown poems by Dafydd that he claimed to have discovered; these poems are regarded as Williams' first [[Literary forgery|literary forgeries]].<ref name="Jonesiolo">Jones, Mary (2004). [http://www.maryjones.us/jce/iolo.html "Edward Williams/Iolo Morganwg/Iolo Morgannwg"]. From ''Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia''. Retrieved June 11, 2009.</ref> In 1794 he published some of his own poetry, which was later collected in the two-volume ''Poems, Lyric and Pastoral''. Essentially his only genuine work, it proved quite popular.<ref name="Jonesiolo"/>

The first printed [[J<U+00E8>rriais literature]] appears in the first newspapers following the introduction of the printing press at the end of the 18th century. The earliest identified dated example of printed poetry in [[J<U+00E8>rriais]] is a fragment by Matchi L'G<U+00E9> (Matthew Le Geyt 1777<U+2013>1849) dated 1795.

Some 60 to 70 volumes of Ulster ''[[Weaver Poets|rhyming weaver]]'' poetry were published between 1750 and 1850, the peak being in the decades 1810 to 1840. These weaver poets, such as [[James Orr (poet)|James Orr]], looked to Scotland for their cultural and literary models and were not simple imitators but clearly inheritors of the same literary tradition following the same poetic and orthographic practices; it is not always immediately possible to distinguish traditional Scots writing from Scotland and Ulster.

The importance of translation in spreading the influence of English literature to other cultures of the islands can be exemplified by the abridged Manx version of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]] published in 1796 by Thomas Christian. The influence also went the other way as [[Romanticism]] discovered inspiration in the literatures and legends of the Celtic countries of the islands. The [[Ossian]] hoax typifies the growth of this interest.
[[Image:George M<U+00E9>tivier.jpg|thumb|left|180px|George M<U+00E9>tivier (1790<U+2013>1881), Guernsey's "national poet"]] 

Increased [[literacy]] in rural and outlying areas and wider access to publishing through, for example, local newspapers encouraged regional literary development as the 19th century progressed. Some writers in lesser-used languages and dialects of the islands gained a literary following outside their native regions, for example [[William Barnes]] in [[Dorset]], [[George M<U+00E9>tivier]] (1790<U+2013>1881) in [[Guernsey]] and [[Robert Pipon Marett]] in Jersey. George M<U+00E9>tivier published ''Rimes Guernesiaises'', a collection of poems in [[Guern<U+00E9>siais]] and [[French language|French]] in 1831 and ''Fantaisies Guernesiaises'' in 1866. M<U+00E9>tivier's poems had first appeared in newspapers from 1813 onward, but he spent time in Scotland in his youth where he became familiar with the Scots literary tradition although he was also influenced by [[Occitan literature]]. The first printed anthology of J<U+00E8>rriais poetry, ''Rimes Jersiaises'', was published in 1865. [[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]]'s tales of Bram Bilo, an innocent abroad in Paris, were an immediate success in Jersey in 1889 and went through a number of reprintings. [[Denys Corbet]] published collections of poems ''Les Feuilles de la For<U+00EA>t'' (1871) and ''Les Ch<U+00E0>nts du dra<U+00EF>n rimeux'' (1884), and also brought out an annual poetry anthology 1874<U+2013>1877, similar to [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]]'s annual in Jersey 1868<U+2013>1875.<ref>''La Gr<U+00E8>ve de Lecq'', Roger Jean Lebarbenchon, 1988 ISBN 2-905385-13-8</ref>

Ulster Scots was used in the narrative by Ulster novelists such as W. G. Lyttle (1844<U+2013>1896). By the middle of the 19th century the ''[[Kailyard school]]'' of prose had become the dominant literary genre, overtaking poetry. This was a tradition shared with Scotland which continued into the early 20th century.<ref name="Robinson 2003">''The historical presence of Ulster-Scots in Ireland'', Robinson, in ''The Languages of Ireland'', ed. Cronin and <U+00D3> Cuillean<U+00E1>in, Dublin 2003 ISBN 185182698X</ref> Ulster Scots also regularly appeared in Ulster newspaper columns auch as those of "Bab M'Keen" from the 1880s.<ref name="Ferguson 2008">''Ulster-Scots Writing'', ed. Ferguson, Dublin 2008 ISBN 9781856820748</ref> Scottish authors; [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], William Alexander, [[J. M. Barrie]], and [[George MacDonald]], also wrote in Lowland Scots or used it in dialogue. 

[[Ewen MacLachlan]] translated the first eight books of Homer's [[Iliad]] into Scottish Gaelic. He also composed and published his own ''Gaelic Attempts in Verse'' (1807) and ''Metrical Effusions'' (1816), and contributed greatly to the 1828 Gaelic<U+2013>English Dictionary.

The so-called "[[Cranken Rhyme]]" produced by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of [[Boswednack]], one of the last people with some traditional knowledge of the language,<ref name=ellis>Ellis, p. 129.</ref><ref name=Koch4>Koch, pp. 492<U+2013>493.</ref> may be the last piece of traditional Cornish literature. Later Cornish revivalists produced literary works: John Hobson Matthews wrote several poems, such as the patriotic "Can Wlascar Agam Mamvro" ("Patriotic Song of our Motherland"). [[Robert Morton Nance]] created a body of verse, such as "Nyns yu Marow Myghtern Arthur" ("King Arthur is not Dead").

[[John Ceiriog Hughes]] desired to restore simplicity of diction and emotional sincerity and do for Welsh poetry what Wordsworth and Coleridge did for English poetry. The first major novelist in the Welsh language was [[Daniel Owen]], author of works such as ''[[Rhys Lewis]]'' (1885) and ''[[Enoc Huws]]'' (1891). 

Edward Faragher (1831<U+2013>1908) has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. He wrote poetry, reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and translations of selected [[Aesop]]'s Fables.

==19th century English language literature==
[[Image:Tyger.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[William Blake|William Blake's]] "[[The Tyger]]," published in his ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' is a work of Romanticism]]

===Romanticism===
Major political and social changes at the end of the 18th century, particularly the [[French Revolution]], prompted a new breed of writing known as [[Romanticism]]. [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] began the trend for bringing emotionalism and introspection to English literature, with a new concentration on the individual and the common man. The reaction to urbanism and industrialisation prompted poets to explore nature, for example the [[Lake Poets]]. The third major Lake poet, [[Robert Southey]], enjoys lasting popularity, although perhaps his most enduring contribution to literary history is the immortal children's classic, ''The Story of the Three Bears'', the basis of the original ''[[Goldilocks]]'' story. 

Around the same period, the iconoclastic printer [[William Blake]], largely disconnected from the major streams of elite literature of the time, was constructing his own highly idiosyncratic poetic creations, while the Scottish nationalist poet [[Robert Burns]] was collecting and adapting the folk songs of [[Scotland]] into a body of national poetry for his homeland.
[[Image:Lord Byron coloured drawing.png|left|160px|thumb|[[Lord Byron]]]]
The major "second generation" Romantic poets included [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron]]. They flouted social convention and often used poetry as a political voice. Amongst Lord Byron's best-known works are the brief poems ''[[She Walks in Beauty]]'' and ''[[So, we'll go no more a roving]]'', in addition to narrative poems ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' and ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]''. Another key poet of the Romantic movement was [[John Keats]], whose poems such as ''[[Ode to a Nightingale]]'' expound on his aesthetic theory of [[negative capability]], and remain among the most celebrated by any author of the period. ''[[To Autumn]]'' is the final work in a collection of poems known as "[[John Keats's 1819 odes|Keats's 1819 odes]]". [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]], famous for his association with Keats and Byron, was the third major romantic poet of the second generation. Critically regarded as among the finest lyric poets in the English language, Shelley is most famous for such widely anthologized verse works as ''[[Ozymandias]]'', and long visionary poems which include ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. Shelley's groundbreaking poem ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' calls for nonviolence in protest and political action. It is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of [[civil disobedience|nonviolent protest]].<ref name=AFP>http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf</ref> [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's verse, and Gandhi would often quote the poem to vast audiences.<ref name=AFP/><ref>Thomas Weber, "Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor," Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28<U+2013>29.</ref>

===The 19th century novel===
[[File:CassandraAusten-JaneAusten(c.1810) hires.jpg|right|thumb|145px|[[Jane Austen]]]]
At the same time, [[Jane Austen]] was writing highly polished novels about the life of the landed gentry, seen from a woman's point of view, and wryly focused on practical social issues, especially marriage and money. Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' 1813, is often considered the epitome of the [[Romance novel|romance]] genre, and some of her other most notable works include ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and ''[[Emma]]''.

[[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] novel-writing career was launched in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', often called the first [[historical novel]], and was followed by ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. His popularity in England and further abroad did much to form the modern stereotype of Scottish culture. Other novels by Scott which contributed to the image of him as a Scottish patriot include ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]''. Scott was the highest earning and most popular author up to that time.
[[File:RothwellMaryShelley.jpg|left|thumb|155px|[[Mary Shelley]]]]
[[Mary Shelley]] is best known for her novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' 1818, infusing elements of the [[Gothic novel]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement. Frankenstein's chilling tale suggests modern organ transplants, tissue regeneration, that remind readers of the moral issues raised by today's medicine. Shelley's 1826 novel ''[[The Last Man]]'' is often identified as the first work of modern [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] fiction.<ref>M. Keith Booker, Anne-Marie Thomas [http://books.google.com/books?id=uW9xST9UsOIC&pg=PA53&dq=the+last+man+apocalyptic+fiction&hl=en&ei=qXP-TNq4NdC7hAeqyISlCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=the%20last%20man%20apocalyptic%20fiction&f=false The science fiction handbook] John Wiley and Sons, 2009 </ref>

[[John William Polidori]] wrote ''[[The Vampyre]]'' 1819, creating the literary [[vampire literature|vampire genre]]. His short story was inspired by the life of [[Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. Another major influence on vampire fiction is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' 1845, where many standard Vampire features originated <U+2014> Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, has hypnotic powers, superhuman strength, and was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.<ref>Skal, David J. (1996). V is for Vampire. p.99. New York: Plume. ISBN 0-452-27173-8.</ref>

From the mid-1820s until the 1840s, [[fashionable novel]]s depicting the lives of the upper class in an indiscreet manner, identifying the real people whom the characters were based, dominated the market. It was in the [[Victorian era]] (1837<U+2013>1901) that the novel became the leading form of literature in English. Most writers were now more concerned to meet the tastes of a large middle-class reading public than to please aristocratic patrons. The 1830s saw a resurgence of the [[social novel]], where sensationalized accounts and stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class audiences to incite sympathy and action towards pushing for legal and moral change. [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. 

[[Sir John Barrow]]'s descriptive [[The Eventful History of the Mutiny and Piratical Seizure of HMS Bounty|1831 account]] of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] immortalised the Royal Navy ship [[HMS Bounty]] and her people. The legend of [[Dick Turpin]] was popularized when the 18th century English [[highwayman]]'s exploits appeared in the novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' in 1834. 

[[Image:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Charles Dickens]]]]
[[Charles Dickens]] emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s, confirming the trend for [[serial publication]]. Dickens wrote vividly about [[London]] life and struggles of the poor, often, as in ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', employing a popular style which would prove accessible to readers of all classes. The festive tale ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' he called his "little Christmas book". ''[[Great Expectations]]'' is a quest for maturity. ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' is set in London and Paris. Dickens early works are masterpieces of comedy, such as ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''. Later his works became darker, without losing his genius for caricature.

The emotionally powerful works of the [[Bront<U+00EB>|Bront<U+00EB> sisters]]: Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]'' were released in 1847 after their search to secure publishers. [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s satirised British society in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' 1847, while [[Anthony Trollope]]'s novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England.

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' 1858. [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the 19th century.

[[Image:CharlesDodgson.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Lewis Carroll]]]]
Literature for children was published during the Victorian period, some of which has become globally well-known, such as the works of [[Lewis Carroll]], notably ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', while [[Anna Sewell]] wrote the classic animal novel ''[[Black Beauty]]''.

[[Wilkie Collins]] [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' 1868, is often considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language.<ref>David, Deirdre [http://books.google.com/books?id=VXQXzUbCSygC&pg=PA179&dq=the+first,+the+longest,+and+the+best+of+modern+English+detective+novels&cd=5#v=onepage&q=the%20first%2C%20the%20longest%2C%20and%20the%20best%20of%20modern%20English%20detective%20novels&f=false The Cambridge companion to the Victorian novel] p.179. Cambridge University Press, 2001.</ref> ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]].

The novels of [[George Eliot]], such as ''[[Middlemarch]]'', were a milestone of [[literary realism]], and combine high [[Victorian literature|Victorian literary]] detail with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow confines they often depict. Novels of [[Thomas Hardy]] and others, dealt with the changing social and economic situation of the countryside.

[[Image:BramStoker.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Bram Stoker]]]]
[[Penny dreadful]] publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous [[Sweeney Todd]]. The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' 1865, and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. [[Bram Stoker]], author of seminal horror work ''[[Dracula]]'', featured as its primary antagonist the vampire [[Count Dracula]], with the [[vampire hunter]] [[Abraham Van Helsing]] his arch-enemy. ''Dracula'' has been attributed to a number of [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].
[[Image:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|130px|left|thumb|[[H. G. Wells]]]]
[[H. G. Wells]], who alongside Jules Verne, is referred to as "The Father of Science Fiction", invented a number of themes that are now classic in the [[science fiction]] genre. ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' 1898, describing an invasion of late Victorian England by Martians using tripod fighting machines equipped with advanced weaponry, is a seminal depiction of an [[alien invasion]] of Earth. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of time travel using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposefully and selectively. The term "''[[Time travel|time machine]]''" coined by Wells, is now universally used to refer to such a vehicle.

[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess, skillful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases.  Holmes' [[archenemy]] [[Professor Moriarty]], is widely considered to be the first true example of a [[supervillain]], while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six [[short stories]] featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr. John H. Watson]].

The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novels]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' 1894, and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]'', 1898.

[[F. Anstey]]'s [[comic novel]] ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river [[Thames]]. Grossmith brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] & [[Weedon Grossmith|Weedon]]'s ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.

In the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern [[picture book]] were illustrated books of poems and [[Short story|short stories]] produced by English illustrators [[Randolph Caldecott]], [[Walter Crane]], and [[Kate Greenaway]]. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books, include [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Cicely Mary Barker]], [[W. Heath Robinson]], [[Henry J. Ford]], [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], and [[George Cruikshank]]. One of the earliest and most influential books with the format that modern picture books retain is [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''.

An important forerunner of [[modernist literature]], [[Joseph Conrad]] wrote the novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' 1899, a [[symbolic]] story within a story or [[frame narrative]] about an Englishman Marlow's foreign assignment, that is widely regarded as a significant work of English literature and part of the [[Western canon]].

===Victorian poets===
[[Image:Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Lord Tennyson]]]]
Leading poetic figures of Victorian era include; [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], and [[Matthew Arnold]], whilst multi-disciplinary talents such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] were also famous for their poetry. The poetry of this period was heavily influenced by the Romantics, but also went off in its own directions.  Particularly notable was the development of the [[dramatic monologue]], a form used by many poets in this period, but perfected by Browning, most of his poems were in the form of dramatic monologues. 

[[Image:Kipling If (Doubleday 1910).jpg|thumb|left|188px|[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[If<U+2014>]]'' (1895), often voted Britain's favourite poem.<ref>Emma Jones (2004) [http://books.google.com/books?id=WELwa9Sds-EC&pg=PA25&dq=IF+VOTED+BRITAIN'S+FAVOURITE+POEM&hl=en&ei=_QQ5TKWqG5OLnAekhpWFBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false The Literary Companion] Robson, 2004.</ref><ref>Mike Robinson (2004) [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ePsxlk3tTOsC&pg=PA61&dq=IF+VOTED+BRITAIN%27S+FAVOURITE+POEM&hl=en&ei=_QQ5TKWqG5OLnAekhpWFBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q= Literature and tourism]</ref>]]  
[[Nonsense verse]], such as by [[Edward Lear]], taken with the work of Lewis Carroll, is regarded as a precursor of [[surrealism]].  Writers of comic verse included [[W. S. Gilbert]], who produced the [[Bab Ballads]] and the lyrics for the [[Savoy Operas]].

Towards the end of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolism]] and Victorian poetry entered a decadent ''[[Fin de si<U+00E8>cle|fin-de-si<U+00E8>cle]]'' phase. Two groups of poets emerged, the ''[[The Yellow Book|Yellow Book]]'' poets who adhered to the tenets of [[Aestheticism]], including [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Arthur Symons]] and the [[Rhymer's Club]] group that included [[Ernest Dowson]], [[Lionel Johnson]] and [[William Butler Yeats]]. Poetry of [[A. E. Housman]] consisting of wistful evocation of doomed youth in the English countryside, grew in popularity in early 20th century.

===Ireland===
[[Image:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Oscar Wilde]], 1882]]
In the 19th century, the Irish playwright [[Dion Boucicault]] was an extremely popular writer of comedies. However, it was in the last decade of the century that the Irish theatre finally came of age with the emergence of [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Oscar Wilde]]. All of these writers lived mainly in England and wrote in English, with the exception of some works in French by Wilde.

The [[Celtic Revival]] (c. 1890), was begun by [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]], [[John Millington Synge]], [[Se<U+00E1>n O'Casey]], [[James Joyce]] and others. The Revival stimulated new appreciation of traditional Irish literature. The movement also encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of Irish culture, as distinct from British culture.

===Wales===
[[Anglo-Welsh literature]] is a term used to describe works written in the English language by Welsh writers, notably [[Dylan Thomas]], especially if they either have subject matter relating to Wales or (as in the case of [[Anglo-Welsh poetry]] in particular) are influenced by the Welsh language in terms of patterns of usage or syntax. It has been recognized as a distinctive entity only since the 20th century. The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because of the parallel development of modern Welsh literature, i.e. literature in the Welsh language.

===Scotland===
[[Image:Robert Louis StevensonJune 1885.jpg|left|thumb|185px|[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], 1885]]
Scottish literature in the 19th century, following the example of Walter Scott, tended to produce novels that did not reflect the realities of life in that period.

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s short novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' 1886, depicts the [[multiple personality disorder|dual personality]] of a kind and intelligent physician who turns into a psychopathic monster after imbibing a drug intended to separate good from evil in a personality. His ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' is a fast-paced [[historical novel]] set in the aftermath of the '45 [[Jacobite Rising]], and ''[[Treasure Island]]'' 1883, is the classic [[Piracy|pirate]] adventure.

The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers presented an idealised version of society and brought elements of [[fantasy]] and [[folklore]] back into fashion. [[J. M. Barrie]] created ''[[Peter Pan]]'', a boy who can fly, magically refuses to grow up in a never-ending childhood in [[Neverland]], is one example of this mix of modernity and nostalgia.

[[Image:Thomashardy restored.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Thomas Hardy]]]]

The major lyric poet of the first decades of the 20th century was [[Thomas Hardy]]. Following the classic novels ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' and ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'', Hardy then concentrated on poetry after the harsh response to his last novel, ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''. 
[[Image:Kiplingcropped.jpg|164px|left|thumb|[[Rudyard Kipling]]]]
The most widely popular writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably [[Rudyard Kipling]], a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, often based on his experiences in [[British Raj|British India]]. To date the youngest ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], Kipling's novels include ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]'' and ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'', while his inspirational poem ''[[If<U+2014>]]'' is a national favourite. Like [[William Ernest Henley]]'s poem ''[[Invictus]]'' that has inspired such people as [[Nelson Mandela]] when he was incarcerated,<ref>[[Elleke Boehmer]] (2008). Nelson Mandela: a very short introduction. p. 157. Oxford University Press, 2008. "'Invictus', taken on its own, Mandela clearly found his Victorian ethic of self-mastery given compelling expression within the frame of a controlled rhyme scheme supported by strong, monosyllabic nouns. It was only a small step from espousing this poem to assuming a Victorian persona, as he could do in letters to his children. In ways they predictably found alienating, he liked to exhort them to ever-greater effort, reiterating that ambition and drive were the only means of escaping an 'inferior position' in life".</ref> ''If<U+2014>'' is a memorable evocation of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[stoicism]], regarded as a traditional British virtue. [[Robert Erskine Childers|Erskine Childers]]''' [[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' 1903, defined the [[spy novel]]. ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' 1905, by [[Emma Orczy]], is a precursor to the "disguised superhero". In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'', while the [[Scouts]] founder [[Robert Baden Powell]]'s first book ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' was published. [[John Buchan]] penned the [[adventure novel]] ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' 1915. The [[medieval]] scholar [[M. R. James]] wrote highly regarded ghost stories in contemporary settings. Strongly influenced by his Christian faith, [[G. K. Chesterton]] was a prolific and hugely influential writer with a diverse output.

From around 1910, the [[Modernist literature|Modernist Movement]] began to influence English literature. While their Victorian predecessors had usually been happy to cater to mainstream middle-class taste, 20th century writers such as [[James Joyce]] often felt alienated from it, so responded by writing more intellectually challenging works or by pushing the boundaries of acceptable content.

Major poets of this period in Britain included the American-born [[T. S. Eliot]] and Irishman [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]]. [[Free verse]] and other stylistic innovations came to the forefront in this era.

The experiences of the [[World War I|First World War]] were reflected in the work of [[war poet]]s such as [[Wilfred Owen]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[Edmund Blunden]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Following the [[Arab Revolt]], [[T. E. Lawrence]] "''Lawrence of Arabia''" wrote his autobiographical account in ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]''.

[[Image:DH Lawrence 1906.jpg|160px|right|thumb|[[D. H. Lawrence]], 1906]]
Important novelists between the two World Wars include Irish writer [[James Joyce]], alongside English authors [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Virginia Woolf]], [[E. M. Forster]], [[C. S. Forester]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]

Joyce's complex works included ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', arguably the most important work of [[Modernist literature]], that is referred to as "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement".<ref>Beebe, Maurice (Fall 1972). "Ulysses and the Age of Modernism". [[James Joyce Quarterly]] (University of Tulsa) 10 (1): p. 176.</ref> It is an interpretation of the [[Odyssey]] set in [[Dublin]], and culminates in ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. [[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|167px|left|thumb|[[James Joyce]], 1918]] 
[[D. H. Lawrence]] wrote with understanding about the social life of the lower and middle classes, and the personal life of those who could not adapt to the social norms of his time. ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'' 1913, is widely regarded as his earliest masterpiece. There followed ''[[The Rainbow]]'' 1915, and its sequel ''[[Women in Love]]'' 1920. Lawrence attempted to explore human emotions more deeply than his contemporaries and challenged the boundaries of the acceptable treatment of sexual issues, most notably in ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' 1928. [[Image:Virginia Woolf by George Charles Beresford (1902).jpg|160px|right|thumb|[[Virginia Woolf]]]] 
[[Virginia Woolf]] was an influential [[Feminism|feminist]], and a major stylistic innovator associated with the [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] technique. Her novels included ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' 1925, ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' 1927, ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'' 1928, ''[[The Waves]]'' 1931, and ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' 1929, that contains her famous dictum; "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction".<ref>''The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf''.  By Sue Roe, Susan Sellers. p.219. Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref> 

[[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'' 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier works such as ''[[A Room with a View]]'' and ''[[Howards End]]'', examined Edwardian society in England. [[Robert Graves]] is best known for his 1934 novel ''[[I Claudius]]''.

The popularity of novelists who wrote in a more traditional style, such as [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] laureate [[John Galsworthy]], whose novels include ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'', and [[Arnold Bennett]], author of ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'', continued in the interwar period. At the same time the [[Georgian poets]] maintained a more conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism, sandwiched between the Victorian era, with its strict classicism, and Modernism, with its strident rejection of pure aestheticism.

Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular between the wars, exemplified by the series of [[H. C. McNeile]] with ''[[Bulldog Drummond]]'' 1920, and [[Leslie Charteris]], whose many books chronicled the adventures of [[Simon Templar]], alias ''[[Simon Templar#Publishing history|The Saint]]''

[[Image:Aldous Huxley.JPG|left|164px|thumb|[[Aldous Huxley]]]]
[[Aldous Huxley]]'s futuristic novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' 1932, anticipates developments in [[reproductive technology]] and [[sleep-learning]] that combine to change society. The future society is an embodiment of the ideals that form the basis of futurism. [[James Hilton]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (novel)|''Lost Horizon'']]'' 1933, is best remembered as the origin of [[Shangri-La]], the mythical [[utopian]] monastery in the mountains of Tibet. His other notable book is ''[[Goodbye Mr. Chips]]''. Author and playwright [[Daphne Du Maurier]] wrote the mystery novel ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' in 1938, followed by short stories ''[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]'' and ''[[Don't Look Now (book)|Don't Look Now]]''. [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s most notable work is ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'', that is strongly autobiographical and is generally agreed to be his masterpiece. Novelist [[A. J. Cronin]] often drew on his experiences practising medicine. ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' 1937, was groundbreaking with its treatment of the contentious theme of medical ethics, and is credited with laying a foundation for the introduction of the NHS in the UK a decade later. 

[[Evelyn Waugh]] satirised the "bright young things" of the 1920s and 1930s, notably in ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', and ''[[Decline and Fall]]'', while his magnum opus ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' 1945, deals with theology.

Classics of [[children's literature]] consisted of [[A A Milne]]'s collection of books about a fictional bear he named ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', who inhabits [[Hundred Acre Wood]]. Prolific children's author [[Enid Blyton]] chronicled the adventures of a group of young children and their dog in ''[[The Famous Five (series)|The Famous Five]]''. [[T. H. White]] wrote the [[Arthurian]] [[fantasy]] ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', the first part being ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]'' 1938. [[Mary Norton (author)|Mary Norton]] wrote ''[[The Borrowers]]'', that feature tiny people who borrow from humans. Inspiration for [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s novel ''[[The Secret Garden]]'', was the [[Great Maytham Hall|Great Maytham Hall Garden]] in Kent. [[Hugh Lofting]] created the character [[Doctor Dolittle]] who appears in a series of [[Doctor Dolittle#The books|twelve books]], while the novelist [[Dodie Smith]] wrote ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' featuring the villainous [[Cruella de Vil]].

Auden]], [[Louis MacNeice]], [[Cecil Day-Lewis]],  [[Stephen Spender]],  [[Christopher Isherwood]], and sometimes [[Edward Upward]] and [[Rex Warner]]. 
 
One of the most significant English writers of this period was [[George Orwell]]. An essayist and novelist, Orwell's works are considered among the most important social and political commentaries of the 20th century. Dealing with issues such as poverty in ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' and ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'', totalitarianism in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Animal Farm]]'', and colonialism in ''[[Burmese Days]]''. Orwell's works were often semi-autobiographical and in the case of ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', wholly. [[Malcolm Lowry]] is best known for ''[[Under the Volcano]]''

[[Image:Tolkien 1916.jpg|left|190px|thumb|[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]]]

Lewis is known for his fiction, especially ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' 1942, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' 1937, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

[[Kitchen sink realism]] (or ''kitchen sink drama'') is a term coined to describe a British cultural movement which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in [[theatre]], [[art]] (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by [[John Bratby]]), [[novel]]s, [[film]] and [[television play]]s, whose 'heroes' usually could be described as [[angry young men]]. It used a style of [[social realism]] which often depicted the domestic situations of [[working class]] Britons to explore social issues and political controversies. In drama of the post war period, the [[drawing room play]]s typical of dramatists like [[Terence Rattigan]] or [[Noel Coward]] were challenged in the 1950s by the [[Angry Young Men]], exemplified by [[John Osborne]]'s iconic play ''[[Look Back in Anger]]''. [[Arnold Wesker]] and [[Nell Dunn]] also brought social concerns to the stage.

The series begins with ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' 1997, and ends with the seventh and final book ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' 2007.

In the 1950s, the bleak [[Absurdism|absurdist]] play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', by the Irish playwright [[Samuel Beckett]] profoundly affected British drama. The [[Theatre of the Absurd]] influenced playwrights of the later decades of the 20th century, including [[Harold Pinter]], whose works are often characterized by menace or claustrophobia, and [[Tom Stoppard]]. Stoppard's works are however also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. [[Michael Frayn]] is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas.

Formerly an appointment for life, the appointment of the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]] is now made for a fixed term of 10 years, starting with [[Andrew Motion]] in 1999 as successor to [[Ted Hughes]].<ref name=PS>[http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/duffy09/ Carol Ann Duffy is the new Poet Laureate] at The Poetry Society</ref> [[Carol Ann Duffy]] succeeded Motion in the post in May 2009.<ref name=about>[http://www.hlss.mmu.ac.uk/english/staff/profile.php?id=146 ''Manchester Metropolitan University, Profile: Professor Carol Ann Duffy''].

==Non English language literatures since 1900==
[[File:Hedd Wyn statue.jpg|thumb|left|A statue of [[Hedd Wyn]] in [[Trawsfynydd]]]]
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Welsh literature began to reflect the way the Welsh language was increasingly becoming a political symbol. Two important literary [[nationalism|nationalists]] were [[Saunders Lewis]] and [[Kate Roberts (author)|Kate Roberts]]. [[Islwyn Ffowc Elis]] was a popular novelist in Welsh (also a winner of the crown at the 1947 National Eisteddfod), who produced novels in a range of genres new to Welsh literature, such as science fiction in ''[[Wythnos yng Nghymru Fydd]]'' and ''Y Blaned Dirion''. Contemporary novelists in Welsh include [[Mihangel Morgan]] and [[Fflur Dafydd]].

With the revival of Cornish there have been newer works written in the language. In the first half of the 20th century poetry was the focus of literary production, A. S. D. Smith's epic poem ''Trystan hag Isolt'' reworked the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend. Peggy Pollard's 1941 play ''Beunans Alysaryn'' was modelled on the 16th-century saints' plays. 

In the early 20th century in Scotland, a [[Scottish Renaissance|renaissance in the use of Lowland Scots]] occurred, its most vocal figure being [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]. Other contemporaries were [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]], [[Sidney Goodsir Smith]], [[Robert Garioch]] and [[Robert McLellan]]. The revival produced verse and other literature, including the plays for which Robert McLellan is best known.<ref>''Scots: The Language of the People'', Carl MacDougall, Edinburgh 2006, ISBN 1-84502-084-7</ref>

A somewhat diminished tradition of vernacular Ulster Scots poetry survived into the 20th century in the work of poets such as Adam Lynn, author of the 1911 collection ''Random Rhymes frae Cullybackey'', John Stevenson (died 1932), writing as "Pat M'Carty", and John Clifford (1900<U+2013>1983) from East Antrim.<ref>Ferguson (ed.) 2008, ''Ulster-Scots Writing'', Dublin, p. 21 ISBN 9781856820748</ref>

The end of the First World War saw a decline in the quantity of poetry published in J<U+00E8>rriais and Guern<U+00E9>siais in favour of [[Feuilleton|short-story-like newspaper columns in prose]], some being collected in book or booklet form <U+2013> this being a common genre in the Norman mainland. For example, a collection of [[Thomas Henry Mahy]]'s '' Dires et Pens<U+00E9>es du Courtil Poussin'', was published in 1922. The imported eisteddfod tradition in the Channel Islands encouraged [[Oral literature|recitation]] and performance, a tradition that continues today. The [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German military occupation of the Channel Islands]] 1940<U+2013>1945 encouraged increased use of the vernacular languages among those who remained, but the German censorship permitted little original writing to be published. Within the restrictions, ''Les Chroniques de Jersey'', the only surviving [[French language]] newspaper in the Islands, republished considerable quantities of older J<U+00E8>rriais literature for purposes of morale and the assertion of identity. The post-Liberation social changes meant, however, that vernacular literature has never regained the situation it had enjoyed previously. 
[[File:Christopher Whyte.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Christopher Whyte]] (Crisdean MhicIlleBhain) is a Scottish Gaelic poet, who won in 2002 a [[Saltire Society]] Research Book of the Year award for his edition of Sorley Maclean's ''D<U+00E0>in do Eimhir'']] 

The first novel in Scottish Gaelic was John MacCormick's ''[[D<U+00F9>n Aluinn|D<U+00F9>n-<U+00C0>luinn, no an t-Oighre 'na Dh<U+00EC>obarach]]'', which was serialised in the ''People's Journal'' in 1910, before publication in book form in 1912. The publication of a second Scottish Gaelic novel, ''An t-Ogha M<U+00F2>r'' by Angus Robertson, followed within a year.<ref>[http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/4586/1/09kidd.pdf THE FORGOTTEN FIRST: JOHN MACCORMICK<U+2019>S D<U+00D9>N-<U+00C0>LUINN]</ref> [[D<U+00F2>mhnall Ruadh Chor<U+00F9>na]] was a Scottish Gaelic poet who served in the First World War, and as a [[war poet]] described the use of poison gas in his poem ''<U+00D2>ran a' Phuinnsuin'' ("Song of the Poison"). His poetry is part of [[oral literature]], as he himself never learnt to read and write in his native language. As part of the [[Scottish Gaelic Renaissance]], [[Sorley MacLean]]'s work in Scottish Gaelic in the 1930s gave new value to modern literature in that language. [[Iain Crichton Smith]] was more prolific in English but also produced much Gaelic poetry and prose, and also translated some of the work of Sorley Maclean from Gaelic to English, as well as some of his own poems originally composed in Gaelic. Much of his English language work was related to, or translated from, Gaelic equivalents. Contemporary writers in Scottish Gaelic include [[Aonghas MacNeacail]], and [[Angus Peter Campbell]] who, besides two Scottish Gaelic poetry collections, has produced two Gaelic novels: ''An Oidhche Mus Do Sheol Sinn'' (2003) and ''L<U+00E0> a' Deanamh Sgeil Do L<U+00E0>'' (2004).

Highly anglicised Lowland Scots is often used in contemporary Scottish fiction, for example, the Edinburgh dialect of Lowland Scots in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' by [[Irvine Welsh]]. ''[[But'n'Ben A-Go-Go]]'' is a 2000 [[cyberpunk]] novel entirely in Scots by [[Matthew Fitt]], notable for using as many of the different varieties of Scots as possible, including many [[neologism]]s <U+2013> imagining how Scots might develop by 2090. In Northern Ireland, [[James Fenton (Ulster-Scots poet)|James Fenton]]'s poetry, at times lively, contented, whistful, is written in contemporary Ulster Scots.<ref name="Robinson 2003"/> The poet Michael Longley (born 1939) has experimented with Ulster Scots for the translation of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection ''The Ghost Orchid''.<ref name="Ferguson 2008"/> Philip Robinson's (born 1946) writing has been described as verging on "[[Postmodern literature|post-modern]] kailyard".<ref name="Ferguson 2008"/> He has produced a trilogy of novels, as well as story books for children, and two volumes of poetry.<ref>http://www.ulsterscotslanguage.com/en/texts/biography/philip-robinson/</ref>

There is some production of [[modern literature in Irish]] in Northern Ireland.

In contemporary Cornish poetry, [[Tony Snell]]'s work is heavily influenced by the early poetry of Wales and Brittany, and it was he who adapted the Welsh [[traethodl]] to Cornish. The bard Pol Hodge is another example of a poet writing in Cornish. A few novels have been published in Cornish since the last decades of the 20th century, including Melville Bennetto's ''An Gurun Wosek a Geltya'' (The Bloody Crown of the Celtic Countries) in 1984; subsequently Michael Palmer published ''Jory'' (1989) and ''Dyroans'' (1998).<ref>Koch, John T. (2006). Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. ISBN 1-85109-440-7</ref>

Since the 1970s a number of books of J<U+00E8>rriais literature have been published, including two collections of writings by George F. Le Feuvre: ''J<U+00E8>rri Jadis'' and ''Histouaithes et Gens d'J<U+00E8>rri''.<ref>''George d'la Forge: Guardian of the Jersey Norman heritage <U+2013> A study of the life and writings of George Francis Le Feuvre (1891<U+2013>1984)'', Annette Torode, Jersey, 2003, ISBN 1-904210-10-5</ref>

A collection of short stories ''P'tites Lures Guern<U+00E9>siaises'' (in Guern<U+00E9>siais with parallel English translation) by various writers was published in 2006.<ref>''P'tites Lures Guern<U+00E9>siaises'', edited Hazel Tomlinson, Jersey 2006, ISBN 1903341477</ref>

In March 2006 [[Brian Stowell]]'s ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' (''The vampire murders'') was published - the first full-length novel in Manx.<ref>[http://www.iomonline.co.im/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1143&ArticleID=1397570 ''Isle of Man Today'' article on ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'']</ref> 

Original literature continues to be promoted by institutions such as the [[Eisteddfod]] or the [[Mod (Scotland)|Mod]], and by publishing organisations such as [[<U+00D9>r-sgeul]] and the [[Welsh Books Council]]. In Welsh poetry, [[Alan Llwyd]] came to prominence when he achieved the rare feat of winning both the [[Crowning of the Bard|Crown]] and the [[Chairing of the Bard|Chair]] at the 1973 [[National Eisteddfod]] and then repeated the feat in 1976. He also wrote the script for the Oscar-nominated Welsh-language film ''[[Hedd Wyn (film)|Hedd Wyn]]'' (1992) about the life of poet [[Hedd Wyn]], who was killed in [[World War I]].

Translations are an important feature of the literatures of the [[regional language]]s of the islands, for example: ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' has been translated into Manx as ''Contoyryssyn Ealish ayns Cheer ny Yindyssyn'' by Brian Stowell (published in 1990) and into Cornish as ''Alys in Pow an Anethow'' by [[Nicholas Williams]]  (published in 2009), and the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] was translated into J<U+00E8>rriais, from the English version by [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]], during the German Occupation by Frank Le Maistre,<ref>''Eune Collection J<U+00E8>rriaise'', [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Jersiaise]], Jersey 2007 ISBN 0-901897-41-8</ref> and into Scots by Rab Wilson (published in 2004). Alexander Hutchison has translated the poetry of [[Catullus]] into Scots, and in the 1980s [[Liz Lochhead]] produced a Scots translation of [[Tartuffe]] by [[Moli<U+00E8>re]].
