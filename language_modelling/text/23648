Haas was an [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]] in high school, and attended [[Seton Hall University]] on a wrestling scholarship, before becoming a stockbroker. He became a professional wrestler in 1996, and teamed regularly with his brother, [[Russ Haas|Russ]], with the two winning numerous championships on the [[independent circuit]], including the [[CZW World Tag Team Championship]] and the [[JAPW Tag Team Championship]]. After signing contracts with WWE, [[The Haas Brothers]] were assigned to WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territories]], where they won the [[MCW Southern Tag Team Championship]] on three occasions. After Russ' death in 2001 due to a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], Haas began wrestling in singles competition, winning the [[HWA Heavyweight Championship]] once.

Haas formed a team with [[Shelton Benjamin]] and the two debuted on ''SmackDown'' in December 2002. They won the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] twice, and dubbed themselves [[The World's Greatest Tag Team]] before they split in 2004. Haas won the WWE Tag Team Championship once more with [[Rico Constantino|Rico]], and gained [[Jackie Gayda|Miss Jackie]] as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|valet]]. Haas then transferred into singles competition before being released from WWE in 2005. After a short stint in [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] and other independent promotions, Haas was re-signed to WWE in April 2006. He formed a short-lived team with [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Viscera]], before reforming the World's Greatest Tag Team with Benjamin. After Benjamin transferred to the [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brand, Haas began wrestling with a comical [[Lucha libre|luchador]] persona, before developing a character where he imitated other wrestlers and [[WWE Hall of Fame]]rs.

Aside from wrestling, Haas and his wife Jackie, his former valet, run a nutritional store, Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop, in [[Frisco, Texas]], which they opened in October 2008.
