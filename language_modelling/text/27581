'''''Gone to Earth''''' ({{fy|1950}}) is a film by the [[United Kingdom|British]]-based director-writer team of [[Powell and Pressburger|Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger]].  It stars [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]], [[David Farrar (actor)|David Farrar]] and [[Cyril Cusack]] and features [[Esmond Knight]]. The film was significantly changed for the American market by [[David O. Selznick]] and retitled '''''The Wild Heart'''''.

''Gone to Earth'' is based on the {{lty|1917}} novel of the same name<ref>''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7055 Gone to Earth]''</ref> by author [[Mary Webb]].  The novel was all but ignored when it first appeared, but became widely known in the 1930s, as the [[neo-romanticism|neo-romantic]] revival gathered pace, even inspiring an even more famous and wickedly funny parody, [[Stella Gibbons]]'s ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]''.

==Plot==
Hazel Woodus ([[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]]) is a child of nature in the [[Shropshire]] countryside in 1897. She loves and understands all the wild animals more than the people around her. Whenever she has problems she turns to the book of spells and charms left to her by her [[Romani people|gypsy]] mother.

Local squire, Jack Reddin ([[David Farrar (actor)|David Farrar]]) sees Hazel and wants her. But she has already promised herself to the [[Baptist]] Minister, Edward Marston ([[Cyril Cusack]]). A struggle for her body and soul ensues.

==Production==
Filming on ''Gone to Earth'', which was shot in [[Technicolour]], began on [[1 August]] {{fy|1949}},<ref>IMDB [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042513/business Box office/business]</ref>. Studio filming took place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Shepperton]], [[Surrey]].<ref>IMDB [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042513/locations Filming locations]</ref>, while most of the film was shot on location at many sites around [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]], [[England]]. Many local people were recruited as extras; for instance, the choir from the local Methodist church appears in the film. When director Michael Powell heard them sing, he thought they weren't ragged enough to portray a choir of "country folk", only to be told "But we '''''are''''' country folk, Mr. Powell."<ref>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=556354&category=Trivia Notes]</ref>

The film was a co-production with American producer [[David O. Selznick]]. Selznick flooded the production with memos, most of which were studiously ignored. Powell summed up the relationship this way, "We decided to go ahead with David O. (Selznick) the way hedgehogs make love: verrry carefully!"

==Subsequent history==
[[Image:GTE.jpg|thumb|left|275px|A black and white still from the film, which is in colour.]]
Although he had been involved throughout the filming, executive producer [[David O. Selznick]] disliked the finished film and took The Archers, Powell and Pressburger's production company, to court to get it changed. He lost the court case, but discovered that he had the right to have the film changed for its American release. Consequently, he had the film re-edited and some extra scenes shot in [[Hollywood]] under director [[Rouben Mamoulian]]<ref name=amg /> to make the version known as ''The Wild Heart'' (1952). Selznick's changes were mostly additions to the film: a prologue; scenes explaining things, often literally, by putting labels or inscriptions on them; and more close-ups of Jennifer Jones. The most infamous of the alterations are the scenes at the end when Jones is supposedly carrying a tame fox - in the additional scenes, she is carrying what is obviously a stuffed toy fox. Selznick also deleted a few scenes that he felt weren't dramatic enough, some of which were major plot points, so the story doesn't make as much sense as it does in the original film. In his autobiographies, Powell claimed that Selznick only left about 35 minutes of the original film, but, in fact, about two-thirds remains intact.  Overall, Selznick cut the film's length by 28 minutes, from the original 110 minutes to 82 minutes.

The original version of ''Gone to Earth'' was fully restored by the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[BFI National Archive|National Archive]] in 1985. A ''New Statesman'' review claimed the restored film to be "One of the great British regional films" and, according to Powell's cinematographer, [[Christopher Challis]], "one of the most beautiful films ever to be shot of the English countryside".<ref>{{cite web
