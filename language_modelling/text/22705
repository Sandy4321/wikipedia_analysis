'''Brazilian Pepper''' (''Schinus terebinthifolius''; also known as '''Aroeira''', '''Florida holly''', and '''Christmasberry''') is a sprawling [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] (7-10 m tall) that is native to [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] [[South America]], in southeastern [[Brazil]], northern [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]]. In addition, this plant is found in the following states of Brazil: [[Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Esp<U+00ED>rito Santo]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Paran<U+00E1> (state)|Paran<U+00E1>]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], and [[Sergipe]].<ref>{{pt icon}} [http://www.ipef.br/identificacao/nativas/detalhes.asp?codigo=30 ''Schinus terebinthifolius''] at [http://www.ipef.br/ Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Florestais]</ref>

== Description ==
The branches can be upright, reclining, or nearly vine-like, all on the same plant. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 10-22 cm long, pinnately compound with (3-) 5-15 leaflets; the leaflets are roughly oval (lanceolate to elliptical), 3-6 cm long and 2-3.5 cm broad, and have finely toothed margins, an acute to rounded apex and yellowish veins. The leaf rachis between the leaflets is usually (but not invariably) slightly winged. The plant is [[plant sexuality|dioeceous]], with small white [[flowers]] borne profusely in axillary clusters. The [[fruit]] is a small red spherical [[drupe]] 4-5 mm diameter, carried in dense clusters of hundreds of berries.

There are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]]:
*''Schinus terebinthifolius'' var. ''acutifolius''. Leaves to 22 cm, with 7-15 leaflets; fruit pink.
*''Schinus terebinthifolius'' var. ''terebinthifolius''. Leaves to 17 cm, with 5-13 leaflets; fruit red.

Like many other species in the family [[Anacardiaceae]], Brazilian pepper has aromatic [[sap]] that can cause skin reactions (similar to [[Poison-ivy (plant)|poison-ivy]] burns) in some sensitive people.

== Cultivation and uses ==
Brazilian pepper is an attractive small tree, widely grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in frost-free regions of South America for its decorative foliage and fruit. Although it is not a true pepper (''[[Piper (genus)|Piper]]''), its dried berries are often sold as '''pink peppercorns'''. The seeds can be used as a [[spice]] if used in moderation, adding a [[black pepper|pepper]]-like taste to food, but they are toxic in large amounts.

It has been introduced in [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], [[Louisiana]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/esadocs/documnts/schiter.pdf | title=Schinus terebinthifolius; Element stewardship abstract}}</ref>. Planted originally as an ornamental outside of its native range, Brazilian pepper has become widespread and is considered an [[invasive species]] in many subtropical regions with moderate to high rainfall, including parts or all of [[Australia]], the [[Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], southern [[China]], [[Cuba]], [[Fiji]], [[French Polynesia]], [[Guam]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mauritius]], [[New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[R<U+00E9>union]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]] (primarily [[Florida]] and [[Hawaii]]). In drier areas, such as [[Israel]] and southern [[California]], it is also grown but has not generally proved invasive. 

Brazilian Pepper is hard to control because it sends up root suckers and new shoots if the trunk is cut, and trees produce abundant seeds that are dispersed by birds.

"Florida Holly" was introduced to Florida by at latest 1891, probably earlier (Gogue et al. 1974), where it has spread rapidly, replacing native plants, with thousands of acres occupied. It is especially suited to colonizing disturbed sites and can grow in both wet and dry conditions. Its growth habit allows it to climb over understory trees and invade mature canopies, forming thickets that choke out most other plants. The species is now legally prohibited from sale, transport, or planting in the United States, where it is classified as a Category I pest by the Exotic Pest Plant Council (EPPC) <ref>[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/lands/invaspec/4thlevpgs/WGFloridakeys.htm Florida Departament of Environmental Protection]</ref>. To keep the plant from spreading into native plant communities and displacing them, local regulations and environmental guidelines require eradiction of Brazilian Pepper wherever possible.
