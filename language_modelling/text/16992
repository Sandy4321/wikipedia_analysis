The '''Pintail''' or  '''Northern Pintail''' (''Anas acuta'') is a  widely-occurring [[duck]] which breeds in the northern areas of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. It is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]] and winters south of its breeding range to the [[equator]]. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific Eaton's Pintail is considered to be a separate species.

This is a fairly large duck, with a long pointed tail that gives rise to the species' English and scientific names. The male has a very distinctive brown, grey and white appearance, whereas the female has mainly light brown plumage and a shorter tail. The male's call is a mellow whistle, whereas the female quacks like a [[Mallard]]. 

The Northern Pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small [[invertebrate]]s to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. 

This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing,  have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, this species' huge range and large population mean that it is not threatened globally.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''Systema naturae'' in 1758 as ''Anas acuta''<ref name=" Linnaeus ">{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carolus | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Within the large [[Anatinae|dabbling duck]] genus ''Anas'',<ref name="Linnaeus "/> the Northern Pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, such as the [[Yellow-billed Pintail]] (''A. georgica'') and [[Eaton's Pintail]] (''A. eatoni'').

Eaton's Pintail has two subspecies, ''A. e. eatoni'' (the Kerguelen Pintail) of [[Kerguelen Islands]], and ''A. e. drygalskyi'' (the Crozet Pintail) of [[Crozet Islands]], and was formerly considered conspecific with the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere's]] Northern Pintail. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's  breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, Northern Pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's Pintail is treated as a separate species.<ref name= Madge>{{cite book | last =Madge | first =Steve | coauthors= Burn, Hilary|title = Wildfowl: An Identification Guide to the Ducks, Geese and Swans of the World (Helm Identification Guides) | year =  1988| publisher = Christopher Helm|pages =222-224| isbn = 0-7470-2201-1}}</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:Northern Pintail (Male) I2 IMG 1123.jpg| thumb|Male]]
The Northern Pintail is a fairly large duck with a wingspan of 23.6&ndash;28.2&nbsp;centimetres (9.3&ndash;11.1&nbsp;in). The male is 59&ndash;76&nbsp;centimetres (23&ndash;30&nbsp;in) in length and weighs 450&ndash;1360 grammes (1&ndash;3&nbsp;lb), and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is 51&ndash;64&nbsp;centimetres (20&ndash;25&nbsp;in) long and weighs 454&ndash;1135&nbsp;grammes (1&ndash;2.5&nbsp;lb).<ref name= umich/> The male in breeding [[plumage]] has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail,<ref name=Madge/> which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in). The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.<ref name= Gooders >{{cite book | last = Gooders | first = John | coauthors= Boyer, Trevor |title = Ducks of Britain and the Northern Hemisphere | year = 1997 | pages = 58-61 | publisher = Collins & Brown | isbn =1855855704}}</ref>

The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male<U+2019>s; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. [[Image:Northern Pintail (Males) near Hodal I IMG 9252.jpg|thumb|left|Non-breeding males wintering in India]] 

In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake Pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown [[speculum feathers|speculum]] with a narrower trailing edge.<ref name=Collins/>

The Pintail walks well on land, and swims buoyantly.<ref name=Madge/> It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female's speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of 1600&nbsp;metres (1&nbsp;mi).<ref name=Collins/>

The male's call is  a soft ''proop-proop'' whistle, similar to that of the [[Common Teal]], whereas the female has a [[Mallard|Mallard-like]] descending quack, and a low croak when flushed.<ref name=Madge/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Northern Pintails, Garganies etc.- Taking off at Purbasthali I IMG 1544.jpg|thumb|  Wintering Pintails and [[Garganey]]s in  [[West Bengal]]. ]]

This [[dabbling duck]] breeds across northern areas of [[Eurasia]] south to about [[Poland]] and [[Mongolia]],<ref name= umich/> and in [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and the mid-western [[United States]]. It winters mainly south of its breeding range, reaching almost to the equator in [[Panama]], northern [[Sahara|sub-Saharan]] [[Africa]] and tropical south Asia. Small numbers migrate to [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] islands, particularly  [[Hawaii]], where a few hundred birds winter on the main islands in shallow [[wetland]]s and flooded agricultural habitats.<ref name=Madge/> [[Atlantic Ocean|Transatlantic]] journeys also occur: a bird that was caught and [[bird ringing|ringed]] in [[Labrador]], Canada, was shot by a hunter in [[England]] nine days later.<ref name=umich/> In parts of the range, such as [[Great Britain]] and the northwestern United States, the Pintail may be present all year.<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter. (2001). ''Birds of Europe.'' Princeton University Press. p 48-9 ISBN 0691050546</ref><ref name = Cornell>{{cite web|title= Northern Pintail species description |work=Bird Guide |url= http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Northern_Pintail_dtl.html |publisher= Cornell Lab of Ornithology |accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref><ref name = SDB>{{cite web|title= Northern Pintail Information and Photos |work= Species accounts|url= http://www.sdakotabirds.com/species/northern_pintail_info.htm |publisher= South Dakota Birds and Birding |accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>

The Northern Pintail's breeding habitat is open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra, In winter, it will utilise a wider range of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.<ref name=Madge/>

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
[[Image:2005.01.10-10.18.52-(DSCF00.jpg|thumb|Breeding pair]]
Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. The male courts the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there is a group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.<ref name= umich/>

Breeding takes place between April and June, with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location, often some distance from water. It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down.<ref name= Madge/> The female lays seven to nine cream-coloured eggs at the rate of one per day; <ref name= umich/> the eggs are 55&nbsp;x&nbsp;38 millimetres (2.2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;in) in size and weigh 45&nbsp;grammes (1.6&nbsp;oz), of which 7% is shell.<ref name= BTO/> If predators destroy the first  clutch, the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July.<ref name= umich/>

The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch. The [[precocial]] downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed [[moult]]ing.<ref name= umich/>

Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce.<ref name= umich/> The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] bird,<ref name = BTO>{{cite web|title= Pintail ''Anas acuta'' [Linnaeus, 1758] |work= BTO''Web'' BirdFacts|url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob1890.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> but the average life span for wild birds will be much shorter than this, and is likely to be similar to that of other wild ducks, such as the [[Mallard]], at about two years.<ref name = Guidetobirds>{{cite web|title= Mallard Duck Drake: ''Anas platyrhynchos''|work=Guide to Birds |url= http://www.paraisongibon.com/mallard-duck-drake-anas-platyrhynchos.html |publisher= |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Northern Pintails (Male & Female)- Up-ending I 342.jpg|thumb|Up-ending to feed (male on right)]]
The Pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting.<ref name=Madge/> Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to 30&nbsp;centimetres (1&nbsp;ft) deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard.<ref name=Gooders/>

The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and [[rhizome]]s of aquatic plants, but the Pintail  sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other ''Anas'' ducks.<ref name=Gooders/>  During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly [[invertebrate]] animals, including aquatic [[insect]]s, [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s.<ref name=umich/>

==Health==
Pintail nests and chicks are vulnerable to predation by mammals, such as [[fox]]es and [[badger]]s, and birds like [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s and [[magpie]]s. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large [[carnivore]]s such as [[bobcat]]s.<ref name= umich>{{cite web |last= Robinson |first= Jerry |coauthors= Johansson, Carl (editor) |title=''Anas acuta'' |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Anas_acuta.html |year=2002 |work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref> Large [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], such as [[Goshawk|Northern Goshawks]], will take ducks from the ground, and some [[falcon]]s, including the [[Gyrfalcon]], have the speed and power to catch flying birds.<ref name=Forsman>{{cite book | last =Forsman | first =Dick  | coauthors= |title = The Raptors of Europe & the Middle East A Handbook of Field Identification | year =  2008| publisher = Princeton University Press | pages = 21-25|isbn =0856610984 }}</ref>

==Status==
The Northern Pintail  has a large range, estimated at 10&nbsp;million square kilometres (0.4-3.8&nbsp;million sq mi), and a population estimated at 6.1&ndash;7.7 million individuals. It is therefore not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold  criterion of a population decline  of more than 30% in ten years or three generations, and is evaluated as Least Concern.<ref name= IUCN/>

Pintails in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5 million water birds, the majority being Northern Pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.<ref name= Friend/>
