He wrote to every club in the local area, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] asking for a trial. [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] responded first, two weeks before any other club, and a trial was offered. During the trial, he scored two goals in three games and was handed a scholarship straight away. He made his full team debut in 2003.  

He made six appearances in the league during the 2003&ndash;04 season, with the away performance at QPR particularly good. The next season Davies achieved his first promotion as he appeared in 44 league games for the Hatters, scoring his first senior goal in the title-clinching win at [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. Davies was named League One Player of the Year for that season,<ref name="AVFC Davies Profile">{{cite news
