==History==

===Early history===
Occupying land in both [[Charlotte County, Florida|Charlotte County]] and [[Lee County, Florida|Lee County]] near [[Fort Myers, Florida]], Babcock Ranch was named for [[Edward V. Babcock|Edward Vose Babcock]], a lumber baron<ref name=Parker2>{{cite news |title=Big Deal |author=Betty Parker |newspaper=Gulfshore Life |date=01 February 2008 |url=http://www.gulfshorelife.com/ARTICLES/Past-Issues/2008/February-2008/Big-Deal.aspx |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> and former mayor of [[Pittsburgh]], who purchased the land in 1914.<ref name=Bernstein>{{cite news |title=Betting the Ranch in Southwest Florida |author=Fred A. Bernstein |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 July 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/realestate/30national.html |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> The land's primary use was logging and agriculture,<ref name=Parker2/> and those uses continue to generate funds for maintenance and operation of the Babcock Ranch Preserve. The Babcock Ranch Preserve Act enacted by the Florida legislature in 2006 made it the first Florida preserve responsible for generating its own funding under a public private management partnership that includes the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Department of Forestry.<ref name=USNews>{{cite news |title=Gov. Bush Signs Bill to Purchase Babcock Ranch |newspaper=US States News |date=19 June 2006}}</ref>

===Sale===
In the late 1990s, the Babcock family sought to sell the ranch to the state of Florida. The property was considered a priority for purchase by conservation leaders who saw it as the final section needed to establish an environmental corridor stretching from Lake Okeechobee in the center of Florida all of the way to the Charlotte Harbor Estuary on Florida<U+2019>s Gulf Coast.<ref name=Fullerton>{{cite news |title=State boosts offer, sets deal deadline; One option raises development fears |author=Wendy Fullerton |newspaper=The News-Press |date=7 April 2005}}</ref>

The state offered [[United States dollar|US$]]455 million for {{convert|91,000|acre|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on}} in 2005,<ref name=Bernstein/>
but  negotiations broke down over the structure of the transaction and tax issues.  A sale of the real estate would have triggered significant tax liabilities that could be avoided if ownership was transferred through sale of all corporate stock. The state was barred from meeting the family<U+2019>s terms by a provision in the [[Florida Constitution|state constitution]] which prohibits use of land acquisition funds for purchase of a private company<U+2019>s stock.<ref name=Parker2/>

Florida real estate development firm Kitson & Partners, led by former professional [[American football]] player [[Syd Kitson]], signed a contract for purchase of the Babcock Florida Company including the ranch in July of 2005<ref name=Martin>{{cite news |title=Once in a lifetime opportunity |author=Greg Martin |newspaper=The Charlotte Sun |date=23 July 2005}}</ref> and laid out a plan to sell over {{convert|74,000|acres|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on|adj=on}}<ref name=Bernstein/> to the State of Florida for preservation of the most  [[Environmentally Sensitive Area|environmentally-sensitive areas]]<ref name=Grunwald/> The contract was contingent on a series of local and state approvals for development on the property to be retained by Kitson & Partners and a land management agreement that would provide for continued ranching operations and employment of the ranch staff under state ownership.<ref name=Parker2/><ref name=Martin/> Purchase from the family and sale of the preserve lands to the State of Florida and Lee County closed on July 31, 2006.<ref name=Parker2/><ref name=Bernstein/> 

As part of the arrangement, Kitson & Partners received $350 million for the land, with approximately $310 million provided in the final budget of Governor [[Jeb Bush]] and $40 million from Lee County, Florida.<ref name=Parker>{{cite news |title=Jeb puts $310 M in pot for Babcock |author=Betty Parker |newspaper=The News Press |date=2 February 2006}}</ref> According to ''Time'', the purchase was the "largest preservation buy in Florida history".<ref name=Grunwald/> Governor Bush stated that the state ownership "would preserve the single largest tract of contiguous land in the state's history".<ref name=Parker/>

===Community and infrastructure===
Plans for the proposed future city of Babcock Ranch were developed with public participation through a series of planning <U+201C>charettes<U+201D> held in Charlotte County in early 2006<ref name=Martin>{{cite news |title=Developer begins workshops on new city |author=Greg Martin |newspaper=The Charlotte Sun |date=26 January 2006}}</ref> and formally announced with the first application for development approvals.<ref name=FortMyers>{{cite news |title=Babcock blueprint is 90 percent green |newspaper=Fort Myers News-Press |date=15 March 2006}}</ref> Designed as a magnet for high tech companies and research and development hub for clean energy methods, Babcock Ranch will be completely self-contained, with 20,000 permanent jobs<ref name=Burnham>{{cite news |title=Developer shrugs off recession, plots all-solar Fla. city |author=Michael Burnham |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 April 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/04/09/09greenwire-developer-shrugs-off-recession-plots-allsolar-10492.html |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> sustaining up to 45,000 residents in 19,500 households.

Kitson & Partners is expected to break ground on infrastructure and housing developments sometime in late 2011 or early 2012, with construction of homes and buildings to follow, and with the first residents and businesses to move in during late 2013.<ref name=Sarasota>{{cite news |title=Kitson secures private funds |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=11 September 2010 |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20080911/ARTICLE/809110348 |accessdate=29 September 2010}}</ref> 

===Solar power generation===
An on-site 75-[[megawatt]] solar [[photovoltaic array]],<ref name=Bishop>{{cite news |title=Babcock Ranch to be United States first solar powered city |author=Pete Bishop |newspaper=Naples Daily News |date=9 April 2009 |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2009/apr/09/babcock-ranch-be-worlds-first-solar-powered-city/ |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> to be built by [[Florida Power & Light|Florida Power & Light Company]],<ref name=Burnham/>
will combine with a network of solar rooftop arrays on commercial buildings<ref name=Nusca/> to generate more energy than the city consumes,<ref name=FMRW/> making Babcock Ranch the first solar-powered city in the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/10/solarpowered-city-in-flor_n_185683.html |title=Solar-Powered City in Florida |date=10 April 2009 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> 

According to Florida Power & Light chief development officer Eric Silagy, the photovoltaic solar plant to be built at Babcock Ranch will be the largest in the world,<ref name=Burnham/> occupying rooftops throughout the city plus {{convert|400|acre|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on}} of land.<ref name=Nusca/> It is expected to be almost two times the size as the current largest array.<ref name=Grunwald/> Babcock Ranch's solar power plant will connect to the [[Electric power transmission|main grid]] so a consistent energy supply can be maintained by importing power on overcast days and exporting it on sunny days.<ref name=Nusca/> The objective in using a solar generator to power the city is a reduction in [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] and dependence on [[petroleum|oil]], and to lower energy bills for residents, aided by proposed "smart home" energy efficiency technology.<ref name=Grunwald/> Residents and businesses will utilize smart grid technology to monitor and control their energy consumption.<ref name=Grunwald/>

==Nature preserve==
Approximately ninety percent of Babcock Ranch's total land will remain undeveloped,<ref name=Parker2/> including more than half of the area owned by developers Kitson & Partners, to be preserved as open space, nature reserves or for agricultural use.<ref name=Burnham/> The Babcock Ranch Preserve, which includes land owned by the State of Florida and by Lee County, covers eighty percent of the ranch's original approximately {{convert|91,000|acre|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on}}. The preserve is self-funding, with all operations supported by revenue from the publicly owned working ranch, the first and only of its type in Florida.<ref name=Parker2/> The preserve is being managed by Kitson & Partners until 2016 when a non-profit entity with board members appointed by the state will take over.<ref name=Bernstein/> The state plans to continue business enterprises to maintain the publicly owned land as a nature reserve with accommodations for recreation, including hunting, camping and hiking.<ref name=Burnham/>
