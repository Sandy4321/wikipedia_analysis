'''Martin Luther King, Jr.''' (January 15, 1929&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist, and leader in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]]. He is best known for his role in the advancement of [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] using nonviolent [[civil disobedience]]. King has become a national icon in the history of [[American progressivism]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Conscience of a Liberal |last=Krugman |first=Paul R. |year=2009 |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |isbn= 9780393333138 |page=84 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AHgZib2fngIC&q=Martin+Luther+King#v=snippet&q=Martin%20Luther%20King&f=false|accessdate=2013-01-09}}</ref>

A [[Progressive National Baptist Convention|Baptist]] minister, King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] and helped found the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) in 1957, serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King led an unsuccessful struggle against segregation in [[Albany, Georgia]] in 1962, and organized nonviolent protests in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] that attracted national attention following television news coverage of the brutal police response. King also helped to organize the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], where he delivered his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history. He also established his reputation as a radical, and became an object of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[COINTELPRO]] for the rest of his life. FBI agents investigated him for possible [[communist]] ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter that he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.

On October 14, 1964, King received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for combating racial inequality through [[nonviolence]]. In 1965, he and the SCLC helped to organize the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and the following year, he took the movement north to [[Chicago]]. In the final years of his life, King expanded his focus to include [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]] and the [[Vietnam War]], alienating many of his liberal allies with a 1967 speech titled "Beyond Vietnam". King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., called the [[Poor People's Campaign]]. King [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|was assassinated]] on April 4, 1968 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His death was followed by [[King assassination riots|riots in many U.S. cities]]. Allegations that [[James Earl Ray]], the man convicted of killing King, had been framed or acted in concert with government agents persisted for decades after the shooting, and the jury of a 1999 civil trial found [[Loyd Jowers]] to be complicit in a conspiracy against King. 

King was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] was established as a [[Federal holidays in the United States|U.S. federal holiday]] in 1986. [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King, Jr.|Hundreds of streets]] in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor. A [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial|memorial statue]] on the [[National Mall]] was opened to the public in 2011.

==Ideas, influences, and political stances==

===Religion===
Civil rights leader, theologian, and educator [[Howard Thurman]] was an early influence on King. A classmate of King's father at Morehouse College,<ref>{{cite book|title=With Head and Heart: The Autobiography of Howard Thurman|last= Thurman |first= Howard|page= 254|publisher= Harcourt|year= 1981| isbn= 015697648X}}</ref> Thurman mentored the young King and his friends.<ref>{{cite book| page=6|last=Thurman|first=Howard|first2=Walter E.|last2=Fluker|first3=Catherine|last3=Tumber|publisher= Beacon Press|year=1998|isbn=080701057X|title=A Strange Freedom: The Best of Howard Thurman on Religious Experience and Public Life}}</ref>

===Non-violence===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015.tif|thumb|250px|King at a Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.]]
With assistance from the [[Quaker]] group the [[American Friends Service Committee]], and inspired by Gandhi's success with non-violent activism, King visited Gandhi's birthplace in India in 1959.{{sfn|King|1992|p=13}} The trip to India affected King in a profound way, deepening his understanding of [[non-violent resistance]] and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, "Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity. In a real sense, Mahatma Gandhi embodied in his life certain universal principles that are inherent in the moral structure of the universe, and these principles are as inescapable as the law of gravitation."{{sfn|King|1992|pp=135&ndash;36}}

African American civil rights activist [[Bayard Rustin]] had studied Gandhi's teachings.<ref>{{cite news| title= Book Review: Bayard Rustin: Troubles I've Seen| last=Kahlenberg| first=Richard D.| work=Washington Monthly | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_n4_v29/ai_19279952 | accessdate=2008-06-12 | year=1997}}

Rustin counseled King to dedicate himself to the principles of non-violence,<ref>{{cite book| page= 217| last=Bennett | first=Scott H.| title=Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915<U+2013>1963 | publisher=Syracuse University Press| year=2003| isbn=0815630034}}

</ref>
Rustin's open homosexuality, support of [[democratic socialism]], and his former ties to the [[Communist Party USA]] caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin,<ref>{{cite book | page=62 | last=Arsenault|first=Raymond|title=Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice|isbn= 0195136748| publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}</ref> which King agreed to do.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=42}}

===Politics===
As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: "I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both<U+2014>not the servant or master of either."<ref name="Oates1993">{{cite book|first=Stephen B.|last=Oates|title=Let the Trumpet Sound: A Life of Martin Luther King, Jr|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=85fOOMQaNaQC&pg=PA159|accessdate=2011-10-26|date=December 13, 1993|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=9780060924737|page=159}}
</ref>
In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, "I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party."<ref name="King-Carson2000p364">{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King, Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957 <U+2013> December 1958|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&pg=PA364|accessdate=2011-10-26|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520222311|page=364}}</ref>

King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality: {{Quote|Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.<ref name="King-Carson2000p84">{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King, Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957 <U+2013> December 1958|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qW-NYdIefPgC&pg=PA84|accessdate=2011-10-26|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520222311|page=84}}</ref>}}

Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he was undecided as to whether he would vote for [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] or [[Dwight Eisenhower]], but that "In the past I always voted the Democratic ticket."<ref name="King-Carson1992p384">{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King, Jr.|editor1-first=Clayborne|editor1-last=Carson|editor2-first=Peter|editor2-last=Holloran|editor3-first=Ralph|editor3-last=Luker|editor4-first=Penny A.|editor4-last=Russell|title=The papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4ysIWgsSr9AC&pg=PA384|accessdate=2011-10-26|year=1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520079519|page=384}}

In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]: "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one." King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964."<ref name="King-Carson1998p187">{{cite book|first=Martin Luther|last=King, Jr.|first2=Clayborne|last2=Carson|title=The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr. |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pynSnGuC964C&pg=PT187|accessdate=2011-10-26|year=1998|publisher=Hachette Digital|isbn=9780446524124|page=187}}</ref>

===Compensation===

King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50&nbsp;billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.{{sfn|Washington|1991}}

He posited that "the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils".{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=365&ndash;67}} He presented this idea as an application of the [[common law]] regarding settlement of unpaid labor, but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, "It should benefit the disadvantaged of ''all'' races".{{sfn|Washington|1991|pp=367&ndash;68}}

==Montgomery Bus Boycott, 1955==

In March 1955, a fifteen-year-old school girl in Montgomery, [[Claudette Colvin]], refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in compliance with [[Jim Crow laws#Public arena|Jim Crow laws]], laws in the US South that enforced [[racial segregation]]. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, [[Edgar Nixon|E.D.

King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses.{{sfn|King|1992|p=9}}{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=53}} King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=52}}

==Southern Christian Leadership Conference==
In 1957, King, [[Ralph Abernathy]], and other civil rights activists founded the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). The group was created to harness the [[moral authority]] and organizing power of black churches to conduct non-violent protests in the service of civil rights reform. King led the SCLC until his death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal: an African American Anthology|last= Marable| first= Manning | first2=Leith|last2=Mullings|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=084768346X|year=2000|pages=391<U+2013>2}}</ref>

King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as [[Jim Crow laws]] would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the [[Civil rights|Civil Rights]] Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Race and Labor Matters in the New U.S. Economy|last=Wilson|first=Joseph|first2=Manning|last2=Marable|first3=Immanuel|last3=Ness| page= 47|isbn= 0742546918|publisher= Rowman & Littlefield|year= 2006}}

King and the SCLC put into practice many of the principles of the [[Christian Left]] and applied the tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the method of protest and the places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities. Sometimes these confrontations turned violent.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|p=190}}

===Albany movement===
{{Main|Albany movement}}
The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in [[Albany, Georgia]] in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a broad-front nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation within the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he "had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel."<ref name=Hatchette>King, Martin Luther. [http://books.google.com/books?id=pynSnGuC964C&pg=PT147&lpg=PT147&dq=%22had+planned+to+stay+a+day+or+so+and+return+home+after+giving+counsel%22&source=bl&ots=ufx5vGFL7U&sig=qTflYbxB7-s8zIkaQSat_XYcpz8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vvHmUK68Oqn22AXRiIGoBg&ved=0CGYQ6AEwBg The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.] Hatchette Digital. Accessed 2013-01-04.
</ref>
The following day he was swept up in a [[mass arrest]] of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, "that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city" after he left town.<ref name=Hatchette />

King returned in July 1962, and was sentenced to forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine. He chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. "We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools... ejected from churches... and thrown into jail... But for the first time, we witnessed being persons kicked out of jail."<ref>{{cite book |title=A Testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King, Jr. |last=King |first=Martin Luther |year=1990 |publisher=Harper Collins |isbn=9780060646912 |page=105 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qnoc3JhV5iUC&pg=PA106&dq=But+for+the+first+time,+we+witnessed+persons+being+kicked+out+of+jail&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4OH5UKiEJKTX2QXyt4HIDg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=But%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20we%20witnessed%20persons%20being%20kicked%20out%20of%20jail&f=false |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a "Day of Penance" to promote non-violence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.{{sfn|Glisson|2006|pp=190&ndash;93}} Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for Dr. King and the national civil rights movement <ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961albany| title= Albany, GA Movement|publisher= Civil Rights Movement Veterans | accessdate=2008-09-08}}</ref>, the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=96}}

===Birmingham campaign===
{{Main|Birmingham campaign}}

In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Rev. [[Wyatt Tee Walker]]. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and [[sit-in]]s, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.

King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and "create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation".<ref>Garrow, (1986) p.&nbsp;246.
</ref>
However, the campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist [[James Bevel]] changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join in the demonstrations.<ref name="McWhorter 2001">{{cite book|last=McWhorter|first=Diane|title=Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama: The Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution|year=2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743226486|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7jnr8GdvSZcC|accessdate=2012-08-22|chapter=Two Mayors and a King}}</ref>

During the protests, the Birmingham Police Department, led by [[Eugene "Bull" Connor]], used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news and dominated the nation's attention, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=113&ndash;14}} Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the "Jim Crow" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks.

From his cell, he composed the now-famous "[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]" which responds to [[A Call for Unity|calls on the movement]] to pursue legal channels for social change. King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: "We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed."<ref name=LetterFromBirmJail /> He points out that the [[Boston Tea Party]], a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, "everything [[Adolf Hitler]] did in Germany was 'legal'".<ref name=LetterFromBirmJail /> King also expresses his frustration with white moderates and clergymen too timid to oppose an unjust system:
<blockquote>I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season."<ref name=LetterFromBirmJail>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther|title=Letter from Birmingham Jail|date=April 16, 1963|publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute|url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/annotated_letter_from_birmingham/|accessdate=2012-08-22|archivedate=2013-01-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DXtUBxxX |deadurl=no}} King began writing the letter on newspaper margins and continued on bits of paper brought by friends.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:March on Washington edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]

==March on Washington, 1963==
{{Main|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom}}

King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the so-called "Big Six" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were [[Roy Wilkins]] from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]; [[Whitney Young]], [[National Urban League]]; [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]; [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], SNCC; and [[James L. Farmer, Jr.]] of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|first2=Anthony|last2=Appiah|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|isbn= 0465000711| year=1999| page=1251}}</ref> 

The primary logistical and strategic organizer was King's colleague Bayard Rustin.<ref>{{cite book| title= African-Americans and the Quest for Civil Rights, 1900<U+2013>1990| last= Cashman| first= Sean Dennis| page=162 | isbn=0814714412|publisher=NYU Press|year=1991}}
</ref>
For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President John F. Kennedy in changing the focus of the march.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|last=Schlesinger, Jr. |first= Arthur M. |page= 351| isbn=0618219285|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|origyear=1978 | year=2002}}

Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.<ref>{{cite book| title= Kennedy, Johnson, and the Quest for Justice: The Civil Rights Tapes| last= Rosenberg|first= Jonathan|first2=Zachary|last2=Karabell| page= 130| isbn= 0393051226| year= 2003| publisher=WW Norton & Co}}</ref> With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to work to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|last=Schlesinger, Jr. |first= Arthur M. |pages= 350, 351| isbn=0618219285|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|origyear=1978 | year=2002}}</ref>

[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|King is most famous for his "I Have a Dream" speech, given in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]].]]
The march originally was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and an opportunity to place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.<ref name=farce>{{cite book | title=Living for Change: An Autobiography|last=Boggs|first=Grace Lee|page= 127|publisher= U of Minnesota Press|year= 1998 | isbn=0816629552}}

As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the "Farce on Washington", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending the march.<ref name=farce/><ref>{{cite book|title= Mysteries in History: From Prehistory to the Present| last=Aron| first=Paul| page=399|isbn=1851098992|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005}}

The march did, however, make specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 [[minimum wage]] for all workers; and self-government for [[Washington, D.C.]], then governed by congressional committee.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sixties in America|last=Singleton|first=Carl|first2=Rowena|last2=Wildin|page= 454|isbn= 0893569828 |publisher=Salem Press|year=1999}}

King, James Bevel, and the SCLC, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery, for March 7, 1965. The first attempt to march on March 7 was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has since become known as [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]]. Bloody Sunday was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the Civil Rights Movement, the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.{{sfn|King|1998}}

King met with officials in the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration]] on March 5 in order to request an [[injunction]] against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, "If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line."{{sfn|King|1998|pp=276&ndash;79}} Footage of [[police brutality]] against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=222<U+2013>23}}

King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against the State of Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=223}} The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.<ref>{{cite book|last= Isserman|first= Maurice|title= America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s |first2=Michael|last2=Kazin|page=175|publisher=Oxford University Pressk|year= 2000|isbn= 0195091906}}

==Chicago, 1966==
[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr. and Lyndon Johnson 2.jpg|thumb|270px|upright|King with President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1966]]
In 1966, after several successes in the South, King and others in the civil rights organizations tried to spread the movement to the North, with [[Chicago]] as their first destination. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Ave., in the slums of [[North Lawndale]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/901.html | title= North Lawndale | work=Encyclopedia | publisher=Chicago History | accessdate=2008-09-08 |archivedate=2013-01-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DXxKlutX |deadurl=no}}

The SCLC formed a coalition with CCCO, Coordinating Council of Community Organizations, an organization founded by [[Albert Raby]], and the combined organizations' efforts were fostered under the aegis of The Chicago Freedom Movement.<ref name=Ralph>{{cite book | last=Ralph| first= James| isbn=0674626877| publisher=Harvard University Press| year=1993| title=Northern Protest: Martin Luther King, Jr., Chicago, and the Civil Rights Movement|p=1}}</ref>
During that spring, several white couple / black couple tests of real estate offices uncovered [[racial steering]]: discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income, background, number of children, and other attributes.{{sfn|Cohen|2000|p=347}} Several larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, [[Belmont Cragin, Chicago|Belmont Cragin]], [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson Park]], [[Evergreen Park, Illinois|Evergreen Park]] (a suburb southwest of Chicago), [[Gage Park, Chicago|Gage Park]], [[Marquette Park (Chicago)|Marquette Park]], and others.{{sfn|Cohen|2000|p=416}}}<ref name=Ralph /><ref>{{cite book | last= Fairclough|first= Adam|page= 299| title= To Redeem the Soul of America: The Southern Christian Leadership Conference & Martin Luther King, Jr.| year= 1987| publisher=University of Georgia Press | isbn=0820323462}}</ref>

Abernathy later wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs.

==Opposition to the Vietnam War==
{{see also|Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War}}
In 1965 King began to publicly express doubts about the Vietnam War. In an April 4, 1967 appearance at the New York City [[Riverside Church]]<U+2014>exactly one year before his death<U+2014>King delivered a speech titled "Beyond Vietnam".<ref name=vwar29>{{cite book|title= The African American Voice in U.S. Foreign Policy Since World War II| last=Krenn|first=Michael L.|page=29|isbn=0815334184|publisher= Taylor & Francis|year= 1998}}
</ref>
He spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam "to occupy it as an American colony"{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=107}}
and calling the U.S. government "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today".{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=102}} He also connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:

{{Quote|A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: "This is not just."{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=109}}}}

King also opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on [[social welfare]] at home. The [[United States Congress]] was spending more and more on the military and less and less on anti-poverty programs at the same time. He summed up this aspect by saying, "A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death".{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=109}} He stated that North Vietnam "did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands",{{sfn|Robbins|2007|p=106}} and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, "mostly children".<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first= Lewis V.|page=273|title= To Make the Wounded Whole: The Cultural Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr |isbn= 0800625439| publisher=Fortress Press|year=1992}}

He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to [[communism]] by his enemies, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.

On April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war demonstration where he also brought up issues of civil rights and the draft.

{{Quote |I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements.

==Poor People's Campaign, 1968==
{{Main|Poor People's Campaign}}
In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the "Poor People's Campaign" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an 'economic bill of rights' for poor Americans.<ref>{{cite book| first= Ernesto B.|last=Vigil|title=The Crusade for Justice: Chicano Militancy and the Government's War on Dissent|page= 54| publisher =University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299162249|year=1999}}

</ref>
The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the United States.

King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown "hostility to the poor" by spending "military funds with alacrity and generosity". He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided "poverty funds with miserliness".<ref name=lied/> His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of "racism, poverty, militarism and materialism", and argued that "reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced".{{sfn|Lawson|2006|p=148&ndash;49}}

The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, the demands unrealizable, and thought that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington|last=Isserman|first=Maurice|page=281|isbn=1586480367|publisher=Public Affairs|year=2001}}</ref>

===After King's death===
The plan to set up a [[shantytown]] in Washington, D.C. was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations for the purpose of carrying it out.

On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]" address at [[Mason Temple]], the world headquarters of the [[Church of God in Christ]].

In the close of the last speech of his career, in reference to the bomb threat, King said the following:

{{Quote |And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?

Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight.

King was booked in room 306 at the [[Lorraine Motel]], owned by Walter Bailey, in Memphis.

According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King's last words on the balcony before his assassination were spoken to musician [[Ben Branch]], who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: "Ben, make sure you play '[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]' in the meeting tonight.

According to the [[Church Committee]], a 1975 investigation by the [[U.S. Congress]], "From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader."<ref name=Church /> 

The Bureau received authorization to proceed with wiretapping from Attorney General Robert F.

In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: "No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups&nbsp;... to insure the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited."<ref name=Honey2007ch4 /><ref>{{cite book |title=War at Home: Covert Action Against U.S. Activists and What We Can Do About It |last=Glick |first=Brian |year=1989 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=9780896083493 |page=77 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M4uvwy_C3egC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22No+opportunity+should+be+missed+to+exploit+through+counterintelligence+techniques+the+organizational+and+personal+conflicts+of+the+leaderships+of+the+groups%22&source=bl&ots=xzg-2Y8pAt&sig=-FWC8xzQz4oS2VZtTK0rg-57qss&hl=en&sa=X&ei=57z4UJGwM4nFqgGp6IFo&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22No%20opportunity%20should%20be%20missed%20to%20exploit%20through%20counterintelligence%20techniques%20the%20organizational%20and%20personal%20conflicts%20of%20the%20leaderships%20of%20the%20groups%22&f=false |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref>

===Allegations of communism===
For years, Hoover had been suspicious about potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.<ref>{{cite book|title= To See the Promised Land: The Faith Pilgrimage of Martin Luther King, Jr|pages=246<U+2013>7|last= Downing|first= Frederick L.|publisher= Mercer University Press| year= 1986| isbn =0865542074}}
</ref>
Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC as it was established (it did not have a full-time executive director until 1960).<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The investigations were largely superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.{{sfn|Kotz|2005|p=233}}

The FBI feared Levison was working as an "agent of influence" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.{{sfn|Kotz|2005|pp=70&ndash;74}} Another King lieutenant, [[Hunter Pitts O'Dell]], was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC).<ref>{{cite book| last= Woods | first= Jeff|page=126|year=2004|publisher=LSU Press|isbn= 0807129267|title= Black Struggle, Red Scare: Segregation and Anti-communism in the South, 1948<U+2013>1968}} See also: {{cite book| page= 87| title= The Real J.

For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism, stating in a 1965 ''Playboy'' interview that "there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida".{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=362}} He argued that Hoover was "following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to "aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements".<ref name=Church>{{cite web |last=Church |first=Frank | authorlink= Frank Church |title=Church Committee Book III |work= Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Case Study|publisher= [[Church Committee]] | date=April 23, 1976 |url=http://www.icdc.com/~paulwolf/cointelpro/churchfinalreportIIIb.htm |accessdate=2009-03-28}}

Hoover did not believe King's pledge of innocence and replied by saying that King was "the most notorious liar in the country".<ref>{{cite book |title=Martin Luther King, Jr.: A Biography |last=Bruns |first=Roger |page=67 |isbn=0313336865 | publisher =Greenwood Publishing |year= 2006}}
</ref>
After King gave his "I Have A Dream" speech during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, the FBI described King as "the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country".<ref name=track /> It alleged that he was "knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists".{{sfn|Kotz|2005|p=83}}

The attempt to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were happy with their lot but had been stirred up by "communists" and "outside agitators".<ref>{{cite book |title= Democratic Individuality: A Theory of Moral Progress |page=435 |last=Gilbert |first=Alan |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990 |isbn=0521387094}}
</ref>
However, the civil rights movement arose from activism within the black community dating back to before World War I. King said that "the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals<U+2014>the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations."{{sfn|Washington|1991|p=363}}

===Allegations of adultery===
Having concluded that King was dangerous due to communist infiltration, the FBI shifted to attempting to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he also engaged in numerous extramarital affairs.<ref name=track/> Lyndon Johnson once said that King was a "hypocritical preacher".<ref>{{cite news | title=L.B.J., Hoover and Domestic Spying |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912799-2,00.html |work=Time | last=Sidey | first=Hugh | accessdate=2008-06-14| date=February 10, 1975}}

Ralph Abernathy stated in his 1989 autobiography ''And the Walls Came Tumbling Down'' that King had a "weakness for women", although they "all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage.

David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, "that relationship...increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings...of King's travels." King explained his extramarital affairs as "a form of anxiety reduction". Garrow noted that King's promiscuity caused him "painful and at times overwhelming guilt".<ref>{{cite book| title =Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference|year=1986|pages=375<U+2013>6 | publisher=William Morrow & Co}}</ref> King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that "all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high level relationship we enjoyed."{{sfn|Frady|2002|p=67}}

The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Conspiracy Encyclopedia]] |last= Burnett | first =Thom |isbn=1843402874 |publisher=Collins & Brown |year= 2005 |page= 58}}

One anonymous letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part, <blockquote>The American public, the church organizations that have been helping<U+2014>Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are<U+2014>an evil beast.

A tape recording of several of King's extramarital liaisons, excerpted from FBI wiretaps, accompanied the letter.{{sfn|Frady|2002|pp=158&ndash;159}} King interpreted this package an attempt to drive him to suicide,<ref>{{cite book |page= 466 |last= Wilson |first= Sondra K. | publisher =Oxford University Press |year=1999 |isbn=019511633X |title=In Search of Democracy: The NAACP Writings of James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Roy Wilkins (1920<U+2013>1977)}}

The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an [[all points bulletin]] to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.<ref>{{cite book | pages= 408<U+2013>9 |title= Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |last=Knight |first=Peter |isbn=1576078124 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003}}</ref>

King's main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King's assassination, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]].<ref name=HUDHistory>{{cite web|title=The History of Fair Housing|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/aboutfheo/history|publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|accessdate=2012-04-19}}
</ref>
Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.<ref name=HUDHistory />

Internationally, King's legacy included influences on the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] and Civil Rights Movement in South Africa.<ref>{{cite book |title=Soweto Blues: Jazz, Popular Music, and Politics in South Africa |last= Ansell |first=Gwen |page=139 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=0826417531}}

King's wife, Coretta Scott King, followed in her husband's footsteps and was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006.

There are opposing views, even within the King family, of the slain civil rights leader's religious and political views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would have supported [[gay rights]]. However, his daughter Bernice believed he would have been opposed to [[gay marriage]].<ref name=MPR-WEB1>{{cite news|last=Williams|first= Brandt|title= What would Martin Luther King do?|publisher= [[Minnesota Public Radio]]| date=January 16, 2005 | url= http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/17_williamsb_wwmlkd/| accessdate=2008-08-27}}

In speaking once about how he wished to be remembered after his death, King stated:

{{Quote|I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.

I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.

Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.<ref name="1968 Year In Review, UPI.com"/>}}
