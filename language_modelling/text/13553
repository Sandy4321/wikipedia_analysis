'''Amanda Scheer Demme''' is an American photographer, creative director, music supervisor, and entrepreneur.  Best known as a nightlife producer, Demme was described by The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as an "expert at 'building a room,' choosing a precise mix of guests, sculpting space with light and shadow, and cultivating a mood something akin to performance art."<ref name="LA Times 2013">{{cite news|last1=Piccalo|first1=Gina|title=Amanda Demme is glad to no longer be the life of the party|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/04/entertainment/la-et-cm-amanda-demme-20130504|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="New York Times Dawn">{{cite news|last1=Waxman|first1=Sharon|title=Rough Dawn for a Nighttime Queen|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16DEMME.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=16 April 2006}}</ref>

== Career ==
===New York===
After a brief career in hotel administration,  Demme moved to New York.  At 21,she worked as a doorgirl at [[The World (nightclub)|The World]].<ref>{{cite web|title=I'll Give You the World: Five Best Nightclubs in the History of New York City|url=http://www.bbook.com/five-easy-pieces-the-best-nightclubs-in-the-history-of-new-york-city/|website=bbook.com|publisher=Black Book|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>  In the late 80s, after working for the [[New Music Seminar]], [[Sleeping Bag Records]], and in the hip-hop department at [[Arista Records]],  Demme began promoting shows at Carwash in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]].    At Carwash, she held DJ and  MC contests and booked then-new artists and rap acts, including [[KRS One]], [[Leaders of the New School]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Digital Underground]],and Ultra Magnetic.  She put together private parties and managed artists including Pop's Cool Love --  who were featured on the first-ever ''MTV Unplugged'' episode of ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'' -- and was considered a prominent figure in the New York hip hop community. <ref name="nghtlife LA Weekly">{{cite news|last1=Ryder|first1=Caroline|title=She Loves the Nightlife|url=http://www.laweekly.com/columns/she-loves-the-nightlife-2142785|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=LA Weekly|date=12 April 2006}}</ref><ref name="LA Times Long">{{cite news|last1=Piccalo|first1=Gina|title=In the Wink of an Eye|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/12/entertainment/et-piccalo12|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 12, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MTV Unplugged Season 2|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/mtv-unplugged/yo-unplugged-rap-145344/|website=tv.com|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref><ref name="The Radar" />
===Los Angeles===
Demme moved to Los Angeles in 1993 after meeting Happy Walters, with whom she founded Buzztone Management and later Immortal Records.   In addition to the overall management of the company, she served as Immortal's creative director and in an a&r capacity. Through Buzztone, she and Walters managed artists including [[Cypress Hill]] and [[House of Pain]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A New Label Tentatively Called Immortal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5SUIAQAAMAAJ&q=amanda+scheer+immortal&dq=amanda+scheer+immortal&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h9nxVPOLB5PisATTnIKwDQ&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=May 1991}}</ref> Demme also worked on her first film as a music supervisor, putting hip-hop artists together with rock/metal artists for ''[[Judgment Night]],'' and launched Lava Caro at Guatelindas, a weekly event at an East Hollywood venue.  Lava Caro -- which attracted a celebrity clientele -- was regularly filled to capacity and established Demme as a nightclub promoter in Los Angeles.  <ref name="New York Times Dawn" /> <ref name="LA Times opening Teddy's">{{cite news|last1=Baltin|first1=Steve|title=Invitations are Being Sent|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/23/news/wk-roosevelt23|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=23 June 2005}}</ref>

After releasing several well-received albums, including debuts by [[Korn]] and [[Incubus]] as well as the ''Judgment Night'' soundtrack,  Demme and Walters parted ways.   Demme subsequently created Ventrue Records in association with [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings]], and gained attention via the guerilla marketing campaigns she developed for Ventrue artists including [[Lordz of Brooklyn]] and [[Psychotica]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moss|first1=Corey|title=Unusual can find itself mainstage|url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/article_1c81045c-a1b2-51e8-aa4f-04ec782e3410.html?mode=jqm|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Iowa State Daily|date=June 25, 1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Amoroso|first1=A.D.|title=Bound, Gagged and Powdered|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/080896/article024.shtml|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Philadelphia City Paper|date=8 August 1996}}</ref><ref name="Ted and Amanda collab">{{cite news|last1=Borzillo|first1=Carrie|title=Popular Uprisings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&dq=lordz+of+brooklyn+amanda+demme&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GvfxVOjAIImwsATSxICwAg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=lordz%20of%20brooklyn%20amanda%20demme&f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=1 July 1995}}</ref>

Amanda Demme met Ted Demme, the co-creator of ''[[Yo! MTV Raps]]'', at the show's House of Pain taping in 1992, and they were married in 1994. She subsequently served as the music supervisor on all of his film projects, and collaborated with him creatively on the music videos he directed for the artists with whom she was affiliated.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Atwood|first1=Brett|title=Spirit TV Host Goes Behind Camera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=lordz+of+brooklyn+video+demme&source=bl&ots=eTKU4q58u8&sig=18t8-568tGE5eBOq3hoaRnfBk5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=k_TxVLq0DPK_sQS79YGACg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=lordz%20of%20brooklyn%20video%20demme&f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=July 1, 1995}}</ref> In addition to working as a music supervisor on her husband's projects,  Demme supervised the music for the television series ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' and ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and the films ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' and ''[[Slackers (film)|Slackers]]'', among others. She was also involved with the [[Virgin Records|Virgin]] imprint Cheeba Sounds, who released the ''Blow'' soundtrack, as well as records by [[Nikka Costa]], [[D'Angelo]] and others. <ref name=imdb>{{cite web|title=Amanda Scheer-Demme at IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0770468/|website=imdb.com|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Rashaun|title=Virgin's Nikka Costa Goes Beyond Family Ties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=cheeba+sound&source=bl&ots=9iH_cKvJnC&sig=pdQY11tZBgUnQwY0TNCzemuZMvo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9DDyVOnGH86dygTSvYGADg&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=cheeba%20sound&f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Billboard|date=5 May 2001}}</ref> During the same time period, Demme founded Supermarket, an events-film-music-marketing collective with [[Brent Bolthouse]], Jenifer Rosero, and Dominique Trenier.   With Supermarket,  Demme designed and promoted events for organizations including [[Rock the Vote]] and [[Step Up]], as well as for corporate clients such as [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[DKNY]], ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and [[Motorola]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cuda|first1=Heidi Sigmund|title=Buzz Clubs|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/20/news/wk-buzz20|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=20 March 2003}}</ref>

The Demmes had two children, Jaxon and Dexter. In 2002, when Jaxon was four and Dexter was six weeks old, Ted Demme died after suffering a heart attack.  He had been playing a charity basketball game.<ref>{{cite web|last1=MTV News Staff|title=Ted Demme, Director and <U+2018>Yo!

After her husband's death, Demme continued to supervise music for films, most notably with the Grammy Award-winning ''Garden State'' and ''Mean Girls.'' In 2004, she returned to her role as a nightclub impresaria, turning Monday nights into Los Angeles' "new 'it' night" at the Sunset Tower Hotel, an Art Deco landmark on Sunset Boulevard.<ref name="NY Times Argyle">{{cite news|last1=Corcoran|first1=Monica|title=Never on Saturday|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/fashion/25BOIT.html|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=25 July 2004}}</ref><ref name="LA Times Long" />  In 2005, based partly on her success at the Sunset Tower Hotel, she was hired to develop and rebrand the nightclubs at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].<ref name="SF Chronicle" />  

In June 2005,  Demme opened the Tropicana Bar, which she co-owned, at the Roosevelt.  In  a matter of weeks, "celebrities packed the poolside Tropicana Bar, and anybody else who made it past Demme<U+2019>s velvet rope could consider it a career achievement in itself."<ref name="LA Times Long" /> In October she opened a second bar at the Roosevelt, Teddy's,  which was  named after her late husband.   Teddy's was equally successful, and with celebrities present every night, became a "paparazzi heaven."  Credited for transforming the Roosevelt into the "hottest joint in town," Demme personally oversaw the door, and the exclusivity of Teddy's was even more extreme than it was at the Tropicana Bar, with the [[LA Weekly]] noting that she was both "celebrated and vilified for her in-crowd-only gatherings."<ref name="vilifed and celebrated weekly">{{cite news|last1=Licaro|first1=Lina|title=Lina's Party Pick of the Week|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/linas-party-pick-of-the-week-4169112|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=LA Weekly|date=3 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Corcoran|first1=Monica|title=Amanda Scheer Demme: Queen of the Hollywood Night|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/fashion/sundaystyles/17NITE.html|accessdate=23 February 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=April 17, 2005}}</ref><ref name="nghtlife LA Weekly" />  However, Demme's reign was short-lived; with frequent complaints of underage drinking and noise, a heavily covered incident which ended with [[Courtney Love]] leaving Teddy's in an ambulance,  and a discrimination suit filed against the Roosevelt by football player [[Terrell Davis]], her contract with the hotel was terminated.<ref name="LA Times opening Teddy's" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Apoldaca|first1=Rose|title=Starry  Nights|url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/starry-nights-570533?full=true|accessdate=25 February 2015|publisher=Women's Wear Daily|date=27 June 2005}}</ref>

Demme, who had become progressively more interested in physical design, next launched  H. Wood, in the former location of the Stork, a club adjacent to the [[Kodak Theater]] in Hollywood.  Designing the exterior of the club with bricks that were salvaged from a decommissioned naval base and windows from Andy Warhol<U+2019>s Factory, Demme said she viewed the project as an art installation. "It<U+2019>s more of an exterior palette where people can create their own experience. It<U+2019>s a condensed version of those pockets of street culture that you find in incredible urban settings," she stated in a 2008 interview with ''[[Women's Wear Daily]].''<ref name=WWD>{{cite news|last1=Medina|first1=Marcy|title=Amanda Demme on Her Latest Venture|url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/amanda-demme-on-her-latest-venture-1729750|accessdate=24 February 2015|publisher=Women's Wear Daily|date=28 August 2008}}</ref> Although it was referred to by the media as Demme's comeback, her involvement with the club was limited, and in 2010, she began to focus on photography.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shoeneman|first1=Deborah|title=Yes, Hollywood, She<U+2019>s Back, Maybe|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/fashion/22boite.html|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=February  21, 2009}}</ref><ref name="LA Times Long" /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Painter|first1=Alysia Gray|title=Scheer-Demme's Hollywood Return|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/the-scene/events/Scheer-Demmes_Hollywood_Return.html|website=nbc.com|publisher=NBC|accessdate=28 February 2015|date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>

The first exhibit of Demme's photography took place at the Obsolete Gallery in Venice, California in May 2013.   Comprised of oversized portraits,  her work was described by the ''LA Times'' as "emotional and dark, even cinematic."  In addition to her fine art photography,   Demme has shot editorially for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'', ''[[New York Magazine]]'', ''[[Flaunt (magazine)|Flaunt]]'' and others. <ref name="LA Times Long" />
