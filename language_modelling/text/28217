'''Sir John Soane''', [[Royal Academy|RA]] ({{IPAc-en|s|o<U+028A>|n}}; 10 September 1753 &ndash; 20 January 1837) was an English [[architect]] who specialised in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-Classical]] style. The son of a bricklayer, he rose to the top of his profession, becoming professor of architecture at the Royal Academy and an official architect to the [[Office of Works]].  He received a knighthood in 1831. 

His architectural works are distinguished by their clean lines, [[massing]] of simple form, decisive detailing, careful proportions and skilful use of light sources. The influence of his work, coming at the end of the Georgian era, was swamped by the revival styles of the 19th century. It was not until the late 19th century that the influence of Sir John's architecture was widely felt. 

His best-known work was the [[Bank of England]] (his work there is largely destroyed), a building which had a widespread effect on commercial architecture. He also designed [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], which, with its top-lit galleries, was a major influence on the planning of subsequent art galleries and museums. His main legacy is [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], London. The museum comprises his former home and office, designed to display the art works and architectural artifacts that he collected during his lifetime.

==Background and training==
[[File:Sir John Soane from CW Hunneman.png|thumb|John Soane by [[Christopher William Hunneman]] in 1776]]
Soane was born in [[Goring-on-Thames]] on 10 September 1753. He was the second surviving son of John Soan and his wife Martha. The 'e' was added to the surname by the architect in 1784 on his marriage. His father was a builder or bricklayer, and died when Soane was fourteen in April 1768. He was educated in nearby [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in a private school run by William Baker. After his father's death Soane's family moved to nearby [[Chertsey]] to live with Soane's brother William, 12 years his elder. William was also a bricklayer.<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21">Darley, 1999 pp. 1<U+2013>21</ref>
His brother introduced Soane to James Peacock, [[Surveying|a surveyor]] who worked with [[George Dance the Younger]]. Soane began his training as an architect age 15 under George Dance the Younger and joining the architect at his home and office in the [[City of London]] at the corner of Moorfields and Chiswell Street.<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21">Darley, 1999 pp. 1<U+2013>21</ref> Dance was a founding member of the [[Royal Academy]] and doubtless encouraged Soane to join the schools there on 25 October 1771 as they were free.<ref name="Richardson & Stevens, 1999, P. 86">Richardson & Stevens, 1999, P. 86</ref> There he would have attended the architecture lectures delivered by [[Thomas Sandby]]<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21"/> and the lectures on [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] delivered by [[Samuel Wale]].<ref name="Richardson & Stevens, 1999, P. 86"/> Soane would have had access to the library at the Royal Academy. 

Dance's growing family was probably the reason that in 1772 Soane continued his education by joining the household and office of [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]].<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21"/> He recalled later that he was 'placed in the office of an eminent builder in extensive practice where I had every opportunity of surveying the progress of building in all its different varieties, and of attaining the knowledge of measuring and valuing artificers' work'.<ref>Richardson & Stevens, 1999, P. 85</ref> During his studies at the Royal Academy, he was awarded the Academy's silver medal on 10 December 1772 for a measured drawing of the [[facade]] of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]], which was followed by the gold medal on 10 December 1776 for his design of a ''Triumphal Bridge''. He received a travelling scholarship in December 1777. In 1777 he exhibited at the Royal Academy a design for a [[Mausoleum]] for his friend and fellow student James King, who had drowned in 1776 on a boating trip to [[Greenwich]]. Soane, a non-swimmer, was going to be with the party but decided to stay home and work on his design for a ''Triumphal Bridge''.<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21"/> By 1777 Soane was living in his own accommodation in Hamilton Street.<ref>de la Ruffini<U+00E8>re du Prey, 1982, P. 88</ref> In 1778 he published his first book ''Designs in Architecture''.<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21"/> He sought advice from Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] on what to study:<ref>Stroud, 1984, P. 26</ref> 'Always see with your own eyes...[you] must discover their true beauties, and the secrets by which they are produced'. Using his travelling scholarship of <U+00A3>60 per annum for three years,<ref>Darley, 1999 P.36</ref> plus an additional <U+00A3>30 travelling expenses for each leg of the journey.<ref name="Richardson & Stevens, 1999, P. 86"/> Soane set sail on his [[Grand Tour]], his ultimate destination being Rome, at 5:00 a.m. 18 March 1778.<ref name="Darley1999 1<U+2013>21"/>

==The Grand Tour==

They finally reached Rome on 2 May 1778.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.24</ref> Soane wrote home 'my attention is entirely taken up in the seeing and examining the numerous and inestimable remains of Antiquity...'.<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref> Soane's first dated drawing is 21 May of [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]]. Soane's former classmate, the architect [[Thomas Hardwick]] returned to Rome in June from [[Naples]]. He and Soane would produced a series of measured drawings and ground plans of Roman buildings together.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.26</ref> During the summer they visited [[Hadrian's Villa]] and the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli]], back in Rome they investigated the [[Colosseum]].<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref> In August Soane was working on a design for a ''British Senate House'' to be submitted for the 1779 [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]].<ref name="Darley, 1999 P.27">Darley, 1999 P.27</ref> 

In the autumn he met the builder and [[Bishop of Derry]], [[Frederick Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol]].<ref name="Darley, 1999 P.27"/> The Earl presented copies of ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' and ''[[De architectura]]'' to Soane.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.28</ref> In December the Earl introduced Soane to [[Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford]] this would lead eventually to architectural commissions.<ref>Darley, 1999 p. 29</ref> The Earl persuaded Soane to accompany him to Naples setting off from Rome on 22 December 1778. On the way they visited [[Capua]] and the [[Palace of Caserta]]<ref>Darley, 1999 P.30</ref> arriving in Naples on 29 December. It was in Naples that Soane met two future clients, [[John Patteson (1755<U+2013>1833)|John Patteson]] and Richard Bosanquet.<ref>Darley, 1999 p. 33</ref> From Naples Soane made several excursions including: [[Pozzuoli]], [[Cumae]], [[Pompeii]] where he met yet another future client [[Philip Yorke, 3rd Earl of Hardwicke|Philip Yorke]].<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 33<U+2013>36</ref> Soane also attended a performance at [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and climbed [[Mount Vesuvius]].<ref>Darley, 1999 p. 35</ref> Visiting [[Paestum]], Soane was deeply impressed by the Greek temples.<ref>Darley, 1999 p. 38</ref> Next he visited the [[Certosa di Padula]],<ref>Darley, 1999 P.39</ref> then on to [[Eboli]] and [[Salerno]] and its cathedral. Later they visited [[Benevento]] and [[Herculaneum]].<ref>Darley, 1999 p. 40</ref> The Earl and Soane left for Rome on 12 March 1779, travelling via Capua; [[Gaeta]]; the [[Pontine Marshes]]; [[Velletri]]; [[Alban Hills]] and [[Lake Albano]]; [[Castel Gandolfo]]. Back in Rome they visited the [[Palazzo Barberini]], and witnessed the celebrations of [[Holy Week]]. Shortly after the Earl and his family departed for home, followed a few weeks later by Thomas Hardwick.<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 40<U+2013>41</ref> 

It was now that Soane met [[Maria Cosway|Maria Hadfield]] (they became lifelong friends) and [[Thomas Banks]], Soane was now fairly fluent in the Italian language. Signs of his growing confidence.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.41</ref> It was now that a party of British men, [[Thomas Bowdler]], [[Rowland Burdon (died 1838)|Rowland Burdon]], John Patteson, John Stuart and Henry Grewold Lewis, decided to visit [[Sicily]] and paid for Soane to accompany them as a draughtsman.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.43</ref> The party headed for Naples on 11 April, where on 21 April they caught a Swedish ship to [[Palermo]]. Soane visited the [[Villa Palagonia]], which made a deep impact on him.<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref> Leaving Palermo from where the party split, Stuart and Bowlder going off together. The rest headed for [[Segesta]], [[Trapani]], [[Selinunte]]  and [[Agrigento]], exposing Soane to [[Ancient Greek architecture]].<ref>Darley, 1999 P.45</ref> From Agrigento the party headed for [[Licata]], where they sailed for [[Malta]] and [[Valletta]] returning on 2 June, to [[Syracuse, Sicily]]. Moving on to [[Catania]] and [[Palazzo Biscari]] then [[Mount Etna]], [[Taormina]], [[Messina]] and the [[Aeolian Islands|Lepari Islands]].<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref> They were back in Naples by 2 July where Soane purchased books and prints, visiting [[Sorrento]] before returning to Rome.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.48</ref> Shortly after John Patterson returned to England via Vienna, from where he sent Soane the first six volumes of ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', delivered by [[Antonio Salieri]].<ref name="Darley, 1999 P.49">Darley, 1999 P.49</ref>

In Rome Soane's circle now included [[Henry Tresham]], [[Thomas Jones (artist)]] and [[Nathaniel Marchant]].<ref name="Darley, 1999 P.49"/> Soane continued to study the buildings of Rome, including the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]]. Soane and Rowland Burdon set out in August for [[Lombardy]]. Their journey include visits to [[Ancona]], [[Rimini]], [[Bologna]], [[Parma]] and its Accademia, [[Milan]], [[Verona]], [[Vicenza]] and its buildings by [[Andrea Palladio]], [[Padua]], the [[Brenta (river)]] with its villas by Palladio, [[Venice]]. Then back to Bologna where Soane copied designs for completing the west front of [[San Petronio Basilica]] including ones by Palladio, [[Vignola]] and [[Baldassare Peruzzi]]. Then to [[Florence]] and the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] of which he was later, in January 1780 elected a member; then returned to Rome.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.50</ref>

Soane continued his study of buildings, including [[Villa Lante]], [[Palazzo Farnese]], [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], the [[Capitoline Museums]] and the [[Villa Albani]].<ref>Darley, 1999 pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> That autumn he met [[Henry Bankes]], Soane prepared plans for the Banke's house [[Kingston Lacy]], but these came to nothing.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.51</ref> Early in 1780 Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol wrote to Soane offering him various architectural commissions, Soane decided to return to England and began to organise his return journey. He left Rome on 19 April 1780, travelling with the Reverend George Holgate and his pupil Michael Pepper. They visited the [[Villa Farnese]], then on to [[Siena]]. Then Florence where they visited the [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Uffizi]], [[Santo Spirito, Florence]], [[Giotto's Campanile]] and other sites.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.52</ref> Performing at the [[Teatro della Pergola]] was [[Nancy Storace]] with whom Soane formed a lifelong friendship. Their journey continued on via Bologna, Padua, Vicenza, Verona, [[Mantua]] where he sketched [[Palazzo del Te]], Parma, [[Piacenza]]. Milan where he attended [[La Scala]], the theatre was a growing interest, [[Lake Como]] from where they began their crossing of the [[Alps]] via the [[Spl<U+00FC>gen Pass]].<ref>Darley, 1999 PP.53-54</ref> They then passed on to [[Zurich]], [[Reichenau, Switzerland]], [[Wettingen]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Basel]] on the way to which the bottom of Soane's trunk came loose on the coach and spilled the contents behind it, he thus lost many of his books, drawings, drawing instruments, clothes and his gold and silver medals from the Royal Academy (none of which was recovered). He continued his journey on to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[Cologne]], [[Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Leuven]] and [[Brussels]] before embarking for England.<ref>Darley, 1999 P.55</ref>

==Struggle to establish architectural practice==

He reached England in June 1780,<ref>de la Ruffini<U+00E8>re du Prey, 1982, P. 197</ref> thanks to his Grand Tour he was <U+00A3>120 in debt.<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.59">Darley, 1999, P.59</ref> After a brief stop in London, Soane headed for Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol's estate at [[Ickworth House]] in Suffolk, where the Earl was planning to build a new house. But immediately the Earl changed his mind and dispatched Soane to [[Downhill House]], [[County Londonderry]], in Ireland, where Soane arrived on 27 July 1780.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.56</ref> The Earl had grandiose plans to rebuild the house, but Soane and the Earl disagreed over the design and parted company, Soane receiving only <U+00A3>30 for his efforts, he left via [[Belfast]] sailing to [[Glasgow]].<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.59"/> From Glasgow he travelled to [[Allanbank, Scottish Borders]], home of a family by the name of Stuart he'd met in Rome, he prepared plans for a new mansion for the family,<ref>Darley, 1999, P.60</ref> but again the commission came to nothing.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.61</ref> In early December 1780 Soane took lodgings at 10 Cavendish Street London. To pay his way his friends from the Grand Tour, Thomas Pitt and Philip Yorke gave him commissions for repairs and minor alterations. [[Anna, Lady Miller]] considered building a temple in her garden at [[Batheaston]] to Soane's design and he hoped he might receive work from her circle of friends. But again this was not be so.<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.62">Darley, 1999, P.62</ref> To help him out, George Dance gave Soane a few measuring jobs. Including during May 1781 on his repairs to [[Newgate Prison]], of damage caused by the [[Gordon Riots]].<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.62"/> 

To give Soane some respite, Thomas Pitt invited him to stay in 1781 at his Thamesside villa of Petersham Lodge which Soane was commissioned to redecorate and repair.<ref>Darley, 1999, p.63</ref> Also in 1781 Philip Yorke gave Soane commissions, at his home Hamels Park in [[Hertfordshire]], he designed a new entrance gate and lodges, followed by a new dairy and alterations to the house, and in London alterations and redecoration of 63 New Cavendish Street.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P. 239,</ref> Increasingly desperate for work Soane entered a competition in March 1782 to design a prison, but failed to win.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.63</ref> Soane continued to get other minor design work in 1782.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.64</ref>

==Success at last==
From the mid-1780s on Soane would receive a steady stream of commissions until his semi-retirement in 1832.

===Early domestic works===
It wasn't until 1783 that Soane received his first commission for a new country house, [[Letton Hall]], Norfolk,<ref>Darley, 1999, pp. 64<U+2013>65</ref> the house was a fairly modest villa but it was a sign that at last Soane's career was taking off and led to other work in [[East Anglia]]; [[Saxlingham]] Rectory in 1784 and Shotesham Hall, [[Shotesham]] in 1785;<ref>Darley, 1999, P.68</ref> Tendring Hall, Suffolk, (1784<U+2013>86)<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.124</ref> and the remodelling of [[Ryston|Ryston Hall]] (1787)<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.131</ref>

[[File:Bank of England - Soane's south facade edited.jpg|thumb|200px|Bank of England Entrance Facade 1818<U+2013>1827]]
At this early stage in his career Soane was dependent on domestic work, including: [[Piercefield House]] (1784) now a ruin;<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.138</ref> the remodelling of [[Chillington Hall]] (1785);<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.246">Stroud, 1984, P.246</ref> The Manor, [[Cricket St Thomas]] (1786);<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.244</ref> [[Bentley Priory]] (1788);<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.246"/> the extension of the Roman Catholic Chapel at [[New Wardour Castle]] (1788).<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.247</ref> An important commission in terms of the client, were alterations to [[William Pitt the Younger]]'s house at [[Holwood House]] in 1786,<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.260</ref> Soane had befriended William Pitt's uncle Thomas on his grand tour; In (1787) Soane remodelled the interior of Fonthill Splendens (later replaced by [[Fonthill Abbey]]) for Thomas Beckford, adding a picture gallery lit by two domes and other work.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.134</ref>
[[File:Ground plan of the Bank of England.jpg|thumb|200px|Ground Plan of the Bank of England]]

===The Bank of England===
{{main|Bank of England}}
On 16 October 1788, he succeeded [[Robert Taylor (architect)|Sir Robert Taylor]] as architect and surveyor to the Bank of England,<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.151</ref> he would work at the bank for the next 45 years, resigning in 1833.<ref>Darley, P.304</ref> Given Soane's youth and relative inexperience, his appointment was down to the influence of William Pitt then the Prime Minister and his friend from the Grand Tour Richard Bosanquet whose brother was Samuel Bosanquet, Director and later Governor of the Bank of England.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.60">Stroud, 1984, P.60</ref> His salary was set at 5% of the cost of any building works at the Bank, paid every six months.<ref>Schumann-Bacia, 1991, p. 45</ref> Soane would virtually rebuild the entire bank, and vastly extend it. The five main banking halls were based on the same basic layout, starting with the Bank Stock Office of 1791<U+2013>96, consists of a rectangular room, the centre with a large lantern light supported by piers and [[pendentive]]s, then the four corners of the rectangle have low vaulted spaces, and in the centre of each side compartments rising to the height of the arches supporting the central lantern, the room is vaulted in brick and windows are iron framed to ensure the rooms are as fire proof as possible.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.156</ref> 
[[File:Aerial cutaway view of Soane's Bank of England by JM Gandy 1830.jpg|thumb|200px|Cutaway view of the Bank of England 1830]]
His work at the bank was:

*Erection of outer wall along the north-east corner of the site, including an entrance arch for carriage (1794<U+2013>98).<ref>Schumann-Bacia, P.77</ref>
*Erection of houses for the Chief Accountant and his deputy (1797).<ref>Schumann-Bacia, P.87</ref>
*The erection of the Lothbury Court within the new gate, leading to the inner courtyard used to receive [[Bullion]] (1797<U+2013>1800).<ref>Schumann-Bacia, P.91</ref>
*Extension of the Bank to the north-west, the exterior wall was extended around the junction of Lothbury and Princes Street, forming the 'Tivoli Corner' which is based on the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli]] that Soane had visited and much admired, halfway down Princes street he created the [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Vestibule (architecture)|Vestibule]] as a minor entrance to the building and within two new courtyards that were surrounded by the rooms he built in 1790 and new rooms including printing offices for [[banknote]]s, the <U+00A3>5 Note Office and new offices for the Accountants, the Bullion Office off the Lothbury Court (1800<U+2013>1808).<ref>Schumann-Bacia, PP.107-144</ref>

In 1807 Soane designed New Bank Buildings on Princes Street for the Bank, consisting of a terrace of five mercantile residences, which were then leased to prominent city firms.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.190</ref>

The Bank being Soane's most famous work, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s rebuilding of the Bank, demolishing most of Soane's earlier building was described by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] as "the greatest architectural crime, in the [[City of London]], of the twentieth century".<ref>Bradley and Pevsner, 1997, P.276</ref> 
The Bank job, and especially the personal contacts arising from it, increased the success of Soane's practice.

===The Architects' Club===
A growing sign of Soane's success was an invitation to become a member of the Architects' Club that was formed on 20 October 1791, practically all the leading practitioners in London were members, and it combined a meeting to discuss professional matters, at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. on the first Thursday of every month with a dinner.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.70</ref> The four founders were Soane's former teachers George Dance and Henry Holland with, [[James Wyatt]] and [[Samuel Pepys Cockerell]]. Other original members included: Sir William Chambers, Thomas Sandby, [[Robert Adam]], [[Matthew Brettingham the Younger]], [[Thomas Hardwick]] and [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]]. Members who later joined included Sir Robert Smirke and Sir Jeffry Wyattville.

===Royal Hospital Chelsea===

{{main|Freemasons' Hall, London}}
Soane who was a freemason was employed to extend Freemasons' Hall, London in 1821 by building a new gallery, later in 1826 he prepared various plans for a new hall, but it was only built in 1828<U+2013>1831, including a council chamber, and smaller room next to it and a staircase leading to a kitchen and scullery in the basement.<ref>Stroud, 1984, PP.234<U+2013>235</ref> The building was demolished to make way for the current building.

===Official appointments===

In October 1791, Soane was appointed [[Clerk of Works]] with responsibility for [[St James's Palace]], [[Whitehall]] and The [[Palace of Westminster]].<ref>Darley, P.117</ref> Between 1795 and 1799 Soane was Deputy Surveyor of His Majesty's Woods and Forest, on a salary of <U+00A3>200 per annum.<ref>Stroud, 1984, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> [[James Wyatt]]'s death in 1813 led to Soane together with [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], being appointed official architect to the [[Office of Works]] in 1813, the appointment ended in 1832, at a salary of <U+00A3>500 per annum.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.98</ref> As part of this position he was invited to advise the Parliamentary [[Commissioners' church|Commissioners]] on the building of new churches from 1818 onwards.<ref>Port, 2006, P.59</ref> He was required to produce designs for churches to seat 2000 people for <U+00A3>12,000 or less though Soane thought the cost too low,<ref>Port, 2006, P.74</ref> of the three churches he designed for the Commission all were classical in style. The three churches were: [[St Peter's Church, Walworth]] (1823<U+2013>24) for <U+00A3>18,348; [[Holy Trinity Church Marylebone]] (1826<U+2013>27) for <U+00A3>24,708; St. John's [[Bethnal Green]] (1826<U+2013>28) for <U+00A3>15,999.<ref>Port, 2006, pp. 74<U+2013>79</ref>

===Public buildings===
Soane designed several public buildings in London, including: National Debt Redemption Office<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.207</ref> (1817) demolished 1900; Insolvent Debtors Court<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.219">Stroud, 1984, P.219</ref> (1823) demolished 1861; Privy Council and Board of Trade Offices, [[Whitehall]]<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.226</ref> (1823<U+2013>24) remodelled by Sir [[Charles Barry]] the building now houses the [[Cabinet Office]]; in a new departure for Soane he used the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] style for The New State Paper Office,<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.235</ref> (1829<U+2013>1830) demolished 1868 to make way for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] building. 

His commissions in Ireland included: [[Dublin]], Soane was commissioned by the [[Bank of Ireland]] to design a new headquarters for the triangular site on Westmoreland Street now occupied by the Westin Hotel. However, when the Irish Parliament was abolished in 1800, the Bank abandoned the project and instead bought the former Parliament Buildings.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.262</ref> In 1808 he started work on the design of the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], for which he refused to charge. Building work began on 3 July 1810 and was completed in 1814. The remodelling of the interior has left little of Soane's work.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.270</ref>

===Later domestic work===
[[File:Moggerhangerhouse.jpg|thumb|right|Moggerhanger House 1809]]
Country homes for the [[landed gentry]] included: new rooms and remodelling of [[Wimpole Hall]] and garden buildings, (1790<U+2013>94) for his friend Philip Yorke that he met on his Grand Tour; remodelling of [[Baronscourt]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland (1791);[[Tyringham]] Hall (1792<U+2013>1820); the remodelling of [[Aynhoe Park]] (1798); In 1804 Soane remodelled [[Ramsey Abbey]] none of his work there now survives;<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.189</ref> the remodelling of the south front of [[Port Eliot]] and new interiors (1804<U+2013>06); the Gothic Library at [[Stowe House]] (1805<U+2013>06); [[Moggerhanger House]] (1791<U+2013>1809); for Marden Hill, [[Hertfordshire]], Soane designed a new porch and entrance hall (1818);<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.209</ref> remodelling of [[Wotton House]] after damage by fire (1820); a terrace of six houses above shops in [[Regent Street]] London, (1820<U+2013>21) demolished;<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.210</ref> [[Pell Wall Hall]] (1822). Among Soane's most notable works are the dining rooms of both numbers [[10 Downing Street|10]] and [[11 Downing Street]]<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.228</ref> (1824<U+2013>26) for the Prime Minister and Chancellor of Britain.

===Dulwich Picture Gallery===
[[File:Dulwich-picture-gallery-interior.JPG|thumb|200px|Dulwich Picture Gallery Interior 1811<U+2013>1817]]
{{main|Dulwich Picture Gallery}}
In 1811, Soane was appointed as architect for Dulwich Picture Gallery, the first purpose-built public [[art gallery]] in Britain, to house the Dulwich collection, which had been held by art dealers Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] and his partner [[Noel Desenfans]]. Bourgeois's will stipulated that the Gallery should be designed by his friend John Soane to house the collection. Uniquely the building also incorporates a [[mausoleum]] containing the bodies of Francis Bourgeois, and Mr and Mrs Desenfans.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.200"/> The Dulwich Picture Gallery was completed in 1817. The five main galleries are lit by elongated [[roof lantern]]s, thus freeing the walls from reflections and maximising the wall area for paintings, and it has influenced the design of art galleries ever since.

===The New Law Courts===
As an official architect of the Office of Works Soane was asked to design the New Law Courts at [[Westminster Hall]], he began surveying the building on 12 July 1820.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.221</ref> Soane was to extend the law courts along the west front of Westminster Hall providing accommodation for five courts: The Court of Exchequer, Chancery, Equity, King's Bench and Common Pleas. The foundations were laid in October 1822 and the shell of the building completed by February 1824. Then [[Henry Bankes]] launched an attack on the design of the building, as a consequence Soane had to demolish the facade and set the building lines back several feet and redesign the building in a [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic]] style instead of the original classical design, Soane rarely designed gothic buildings.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.222</ref>  The building opened on 21 January 1825, and remained in use until the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] opened in 1882, after this the building was demolished in 1883 and the site left as lawn.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.224</ref> All the court rooms displayed Soane's typically complex lighting arrangements, being top lit by [[roof lantern]]s often concealed from direct view.

===Palace of Westminster===
{{main|Palace of Westminster}}
In 1822 as an official architect of the Office of Works, Soane was asked to make alteration to the House of Lords at the Palace of Westminster. He added a curving gothic arcade with an entrance leading to a coutyard, a new Royal Gallery, main staircase and Ante-Room, all the interiors were in a grand neo-classical style, completed by January 1824.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.216</ref> Later four new committee rooms, a new library for the House of Lords and for the House of Commons alterations to the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] house, and new library, committee rooms, clerks' rooms and stores, all would be destroyed in the fire of 1834.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.219"/>

[[File:Soane Design for a Royal Palace 1.jpg|thumb|right|1821 Design for new Royal Palace probably on the site of Green Park London]]

===Design for a Royal Palace===
One of Soane's largest designs was for a new Royal Palace in London, a series of designs were produced c.1820-1830. The design was unusual in that the building was triangular, there were grand porticoes at each corner and in the middle of each side of the building, the centre of the building consisted of a low dome, with ranges of rooms leading to the entrances in each side of the building, creating three internal courtyards. As far as is known it is not related to an official commission and was merely a design exercise by Soane, indeed the various drawings he produced date over several years, he first produced a design for a Royal Palace while in  Rome in 1779.<ref>de la Ruffini<U+00E8>re du Prey, 1985, P.37</ref>

==The Royal Academy==
[[File:Somerset House Strand Block.JPG|thumb|right|Strand Block, Somerset House, designed by William Chambers, home to the Royal Academy 1780<U+2013>1837, Soane delivered all his lectures here]]
{{main|Royal Academy}}
The Royal Academy was at the very centre of Soane's architectural career, in the sixty four years from 1772 to 1836 there were only five years, 1778 and 1788<U+2013>91 in which he did not exhibit any designs there.<ref>Watkin, 1996, p. 65</ref> Soane had received part of his architectural education at the Academy and it had paid for his Grand Tour. On 2 November 1795 Soane was elected an Associate Royal Academician and on 10 February 1802 Soane was elected a full [[Royal Academician]],<ref name="Bingham, 2011, P.66">Bingham, 2011, P.66</ref>  his diploma work being a drawing of his design for a new House of Lords.<ref>Bingham, 2011, P.50</ref> There were only ever a maximum of forty Royal Academicians at any one time. Under the rules of the Academy Soane automatically became for one year a member of the Council of the Academy, this consisted of the President and eight other Academicians.<ref>Watkin, 1996, page 67</ref>

After Thomas Sandby died in 1798, George Dance, Soane's old teacher was appointed professor of architecture at the Academy, but during his tenure of the post failed to deliver a single lecture. Naturally this caused dissatisfaction, and Soane began to manoeuver to obtain the post for himself.<ref>Watkin, 1996, page 70</ref> Eventual Soane succeeded in ousting Dance and became professor on 28 March 1806.<ref>Watkin, 1996, page 71</ref> Soane did not deliver his first lecture until 27 March 1809 and did not begin to deliver the full series of twelve lectures until January 1810. All went well until he reached his fourth lecture on 29 January 1810, in it he criticised several recent buildings in London, including George Dance's [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] and his former pupil Robert Smirke's [[Royal Opera, London|Covent Garden Theatre]].<ref>Watkin, 1996, p. 72</ref> Naturally Royal Academicians [[Robert Smirke (painter)]] father of the architect and his friend [[Joseph Farington]] led a campaign against Soane,<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.74</ref> as a consequence the Royal Academy introduced a rule forbidding criticism of a living British artist in any lectures delivered there.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.76</ref> Soane attempted to resist what he saw as interference and it was only under threat of dismissal that he finally amended his lecture and recommenced on 12 February 1813 the delivery of the first six lectures.<ref>Watkin, 1996, p. 96</ref> The rift that all this caused between Soane and George Dance would only be healed in 1815 after the death of Mrs Soane.<ref>Darley, 1999, p. 236</ref>

The twelve lectures, they were treated as two separate courses of six lectures, were all extensively illustrated with over one thousand drawings and building plans in total. The lectures were:
*Lecture I <U+2013> traced 'architecture from its most early periods' and covered the origin of civil, military and naval architecture.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.291</ref>
*Lecture II <U+2013> outlined the [[Classical architecture]] of the ancient world continuing on from the first lecture.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.303</ref>
*Lecture III <U+2013> an analysis of the five [[Classical order]]s, their application and the use of [[Caryatid]]s.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.309</ref>
*Lecture IV <U+2013> use of the classical orders structurally and decoratively and for [[Victory column|commemorative monuments]].<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.317</ref>
*Lecture V <U+2013> the history of architecture from [[Constantine the Great]] and the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]] to the rise of [[Renaissance architecture]], followed by a survey of British architecture from [[Inigo Jones]] to [[William Chambers (architect)]].<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.323</ref>
*Lecture VI <U+2013> covered [[arch]]es, [[bridge]]s the theory and symbolism of architectural ornament.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.346</ref>
*Lecture VII <U+2013> appropriate character in architecture and the correct use of decoration.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.358</ref>

*Lecture IX <U+2013> the design of [[window]]s, [[door]]s, [[pilaster]]s, [[roof]]s and [[chimney]]-shafts.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.370</ref>
*Lecture X <U+2013> [[landscape architecture]] and [[garden building]]s.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.374</ref>
*Lecture XI <U+2013> a discussion of the architecture and planning of London contrasting it with Paris.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.379</ref>
*Lecture XII <U+2013> a discussion of [[construction]] methods and standards.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.388</ref>

==Soane's library==
[[File:Pitzhanger Manor Libraly 1802.jpg|thumb|right|Soane's Library at Pitzhanger Manor c. 1802]]
Soane over the course of his career built up an extensive library of 7,783 volumes,<ref name="Dorey et al, 1991, P.86">Dorey et al, (1991), P.86</ref> this is still housed in the library he designed in his home now museum of 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields. The library covers a wide range of subjects: Greek and Roman classics, [[poetry]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[history]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[philosophy]], grammars, topographical works, encyclopaedia's, runs of journals and contemporary novels.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.8</ref>

The main architectural books include: several editions of [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', including Latin, English, French and Italian editions, including the commentary on the work by [[Daniele Barbaro]].<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.99</ref> [[Julien-David Le Roy]]'s ''Les Ruines des plus beaux monuments de la Gr<U+00E8>ce'', [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]]'s ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'',  in its French translation bought in 1806 just before Soane was appointed to the professorship.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.111</ref> [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s ''Essai sur l'Architecture''.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.115</ref> [[Jacques-Fran<U+00E7>ois Blondel]]'s nine volumes of ''Cours d'architecture ou trait<U+00E9> de la d<U+00E9>coration, distribution et constructions des b<U+00E2>timents contenant les le<U+00E7>ons donn<U+00E9>es en 1750, et les ann<U+00E9>es suivantes''.<ref>Watkin, 1996, P.130</ref> Six works by [[Quatrem<U+00E8>re de Quincy]], including the ''Dictionnaire historique de l'Architecture''. These are some of the major thinkers who influenced Soane and his own writings.

Soane also acquired several [[illuminated manuscript]]s:<ref name="Dorey et al, 1991, P.86"/> a 13th-century English [[Vulgate]] Bible; a 15th-century [[Flemish]] copy of [[Josephus]]'s works; four [[book of hours]], two Flemish of the 15th century and early 16th century, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] of the late 15th century and French 15th century; a French [[missal]] dated 1482; ''Le Livre des Cordonniers de Caen'', French 15th century; [[Marino Grimani]]'s commentary of the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans the work of [[Giulio Clovio]].

==Sir John Soane's Museum==
[[File:Soane Museum 1.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sir John Soane's Museum|Soane Museum, 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields]]]]
{{main|Sir John Soane's Museum}}
In 1792, Soane bought a house at 12 [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], London. Later purchasing 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields, he used the house as his home and library, but also entertained potential clients in the drawing room. The houses along with 14 Lincoln's Inn Fields, is now Sir John Soane's Museum and is open to the public for free.

===Antiquities, medieval and non-western objects===
Between 1794 and 1824 Soane remodelled and extended the house into two neighbouring properties &mdash; partly to experiment with architectural ideas, and partly to house his growing collection of [[antiquities]] and architectural salvage. As his practice prospered, Soane was able to collect objects worthy of the [[British Museum]], including the [[alabaster]] [[sarcophagus]] of [[Seti I]].<ref>Darley, 1999, P.274</ref> 

After the Seti sarcophagus arrived at his house in March 1825, Soane held a three-day party, to which 890 people were invited, the basement where the sarcophagus was housed was lit by over one hundred lamps and candelabra, refreshments were laid on and the exterior of the house was hung with lamps.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.275</ref> Among the guests were the then Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool]] and his wife, [[Robert Peel]], [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]], [[Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough]], [[Benjamin Haydon]] as well as many foreign dignitaries.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.276</ref>

He also bought Greek and Roman bronzes, [[cinerary urn]]s, fragments of [[Roman mosaic]]s, [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] many displayed above the bookcases in the library, Greek and Roman busts, heads from statues and fragments of sculpture and architectural decoration, examples of [[Roman glass]]. Medieval objects include: architectural fragments, tiles and [[stained glass]].<ref>Dorey et al, (1991), P.84</ref> Soane acquired 18th century [[Chinese ceramics]] as well as [[Huaco (pottery)|Peruvian pottery]].<ref name="Dorey et al, 1991, P.85">Dorey et al, (1991), P.85</ref> Soane also purchased four Indian [[ivory]] chairs and a table.<ref>Knox, 2009, P.122</ref>

===Sculpture===
[[Francis Leggatt Chantrey]] carved a white marble [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Soane.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.113</ref> Soane also acquired Sir [[Richard Westmacott]]'s plaster model for ''Nymph unclasping her Zone''<ref>Knox, 2009, P.93</ref> and the plaster model of John Flaxman's memorial sculpture of William Pitt the Younger.<ref>Knox, 2009, P.70</ref> 

Of ancient sculptures a miniature copy of the famous sculpture of [[Diana of Ephesus]] is one of the most important in the collection.<ref>Knox, 2009, P.66</ref> After the death of his teacher Henry Holland, Soane bought part of his collection of ancient marble fragments of architectural decoration.<ref>Knox, 2009, P.60</ref> He also acquired Plastercasts of famous antique sculptures include.<ref>Knox, 2009, P.120</ref>

On the death of George Wyatt in February 1790 the Soanes inherited money and property, including a house in Albion Place, [[Southwark]], where Soane moved his office.<ref>Gillian Darley, 1999, P.95</ref>

On 30 June 1792 Soane purchased 12 [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] for <U+00A3>2100.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.64</ref> He demolished the existing house and rebuilt it to his own design, the Soanes moving in on 18 January 1794.<ref>Stroud, 1984, p. 65</ref> By 1800 Soane was rich enough to purchase [[Pitzhanger Manor]] Ealing as a country retreat, for <U+00A3>4,500 on 5 September 1800.<ref>Stroud, 1984, p. 74</ref> Apart from a wing designed by George Dance, Soane demolished the house and rebuilt it to his own design and was occupied by 1804,<ref>Stroud, 1984, p. 76</ref> Soane used the manor to entertain friends and used to go [[fishing]] in the local streams.<ref>Stroud, 1984, p. 83</ref> 

In June 1808 Soane purchased 13 Lincoln's Inn Fields for <U+00A3>4,200, initially renting the house to its former owner and extending his office over the garden to the rear. On 17 July 1812 number 13 was demolished,<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.88</ref> the house was rebuilt and the Soanes moved in during October 1813.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.89</ref> In 1823 Soane purchased 14 Lincoln's Inn Fields, he demolished the house, building the Picture Room attached to no. 13 over the site of the stables, in March 1825 he rebuilt the house to match externally no. 12.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.204</ref>

===Family problems===
Soane hoped that one or both of his sons would also become architects. His purchase of Pizhanger Manor was partially an inducment to this end. But both sons became increasingly wayward in their attitude and behaviour, showing not the slightest interest in architecture. John was lazy and suffered from ill health, whereas George had an uncontrolable temper. As a consequence Soane decided to sell Pitzhanger in July 1810.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.81">Stroud, 1984, P.81</ref>

John was sent to [[Margate]] in 1811 to try and help his illness and it was here that he became involved with a woman called Maria Preston.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.81"/> Soane agreed reluctantly to John's and Maria's marriage on 6 June, on the agreement that her father would produce a [[dowry]] of <U+00A3>2000, which failed to happen.<ref>Stroud, 1984, pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref> Meanwhile George who had been studying law at [[Cambridge University]] developed a friendship with [[James Boaden]]. George developed a relationship with Boaden's daughter Agnes and one month after his brother's wedding married her on 5 July. He wrote to his mother 'I have married Agnes to spite you and father'.<ref>Stroud, 1984, pp. 85<U+2013>86</ref>

George Soane tried to extort money from his father in March 1814 by demanding <U+00A3>350 per annum, and claiming he would otherwise be forced to become an actor.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.228</ref> Agnes gave birth to twins in September, one child died shortly after. By November her husband George Soane had been imprisoned for debt and fraud. In January 1815 Eliza paid her son's debts and repaid the person he had defrauded to ensure his release from prison.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.230</ref>

[[File:2778soaneMausoleumOldStPancrasChurchyard.jpg|thumb|200px|Sir John Soane's family tomb in the [[St Pancras Old Church|Old St Pancras churchyard]] (1816)]]

In 1815 an article was published in the ''Champion'' for 10 to 24 September entitled ''The Present Low State of the Arts in England and more particularly of Architecture''. In the article Soane was singled out for personal attack, although anonymous it soon emerged that his son George had written the article. On 13 October Mrs Soane wrote 'Those are George's doing. He has given me my death blow. I shall never be able to hold up my head again'. Soane's wife died on 22 November 1815, she had been suffering from ill health for some time.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.100">Stroud, 1984, P.100</ref> His wife's body was interred on 1 December in the churchyard of [[St Pancras Old Church]]. He wrote in his diary for that day 'The burial of all that is dear to me in this world, and all I wished to live for!'.<ref>Waterfield, 1996, P.107</ref> George and Agnes had another child, this time a son born in 1815, Frederick.

In 1816 Soane designed the tomb above the vault his wife was buried in<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.103</ref> it is built from [[Carrara marble]] and [[Portland Stone]]. The tomb avoids any Christian symbolism, the roof has a pine cone finial the symbol in [[Ancient Egypt]] for regeneration, below which is carved a serpent swallowing its own tail, symbol of eternity, there are also carvings of boys holding extinguished torches symbols of death.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.239</ref> 

The inscription is:<ref>Waterfield, P.110</ref>

<blockquote>
Sacred To The Memory of Elizabeth, The Wife of John Soane, Architect She Died the 22nd November, 1815.
With Distinguished Talents She United an Amiable and Affectionate Heart.
Her Piety was Unaffected, Her Integrity Undeviating, Her Manners Displayed Alike Decision and Energy, Kindness and Suavity.
These, the Peculiar Characteristics of Her Mind, Remained Untainted by an Extensive Intercourse With The World.
</blockquote>

The design of the tomb was a direct influence on [[Giles Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[red telephone box]].<ref>Darley, 1999, P.324</ref> Soane's elder son John died on 21 October 1823, and was also buried in the vault. Maria Soane's daughter-in-law was now a widow with young children including a son also called John in need of support. So Soane set up a [[Trust law|trust]] fund of <U+00A3>10,000 to support the family.<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.108</ref>

Soane found out in 1824 that his son George was living in a [[M<U+00E9>nage <U+00E0> trois]] with his wife and her sister by whom he had a child called George Manfred.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.109"/> Soane's grandson Fred and his mother were both subjected to [[domestic violence]] by George Soane, including beatings and in Agnes's case being dragged by her hair from a room.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.310</ref> Soane refused to help them while they remained living with his son, who was in debt. However by February 1834 Soane relented and was paying Agnes <U+00A3>200 per annum, also paying for Fred's education. In the hope that Fred would become an architect, after he left school, Soane placed him with architect [[John Tarring]]. In January 1835 Tarring asked Soane to remove Fred,<ref>Darley, 1999, P.312</ref> who was staying out late often in the company of a Captain Westwood, a known [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.109"/>

===Personal beliefs, travels and health===
On Monday 6 August 1810 Soane and his wife set off on a thirteen-day tour of England and Wales.<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.198">Darley, 1999, P.198</ref> They normally rose at five or six in the morning and would visit many towns and monuments a day. Starting in [[Oxford]] they visited [[New College, Oxford]], [[Merton College, Oxford]], [[Blenheim Palace]] and [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire]], where they stayed the night.<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.198"/> Next day they went to [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and [[Shakespeare's Birthplace]], [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]] to visit [[Shakespeare]]'s tomb, [[Kenilworth Castle]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Whitley, Coventry|Whitley Abbey]], [[Coventry]] and on to [[Lichfield]].<ref>Darley, 1999, P.199</ref> They next travelled to [[Liverpool]], staying for four nights at the Liverpool Arms near [[Liverpool Town Hall]]. They attended a performance of [[Othello]] with [[George Frederick Cooke]] as [[Iago]]. Among the people they visited was Soane's former assistant [[Joseph Gandy]], then living in the city. Their son John was also living and studying with Gandy, in a failed attempt to become an architect. They visited [[John Foster (architect)]]. Leaving Liverpool on Saturday 11, they crossed the [[River Mersey]] to the [[Wirral Peninsula]] and on to [[Chester]] where they saw the Rows and greatly admired [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]]'s work at [[Chester Castle]]. From Chester they visited [[Wrexham]], [[Ellesmere, Shropshire]]. On Sunday they moved on to [[Shrewsbury]], visiting architect George Steuart's [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]]. Monday they headed for [[Coalbrookdale]], with [[The Iron Bridge]] then on to [[Buildwas Abbey]]. The journey continued down the [[River Severn]] to [[Bridgnorth]] then [[Ludlow]] and [[Ludlow Castle]], [[Leominster]]. Wednesday 15 they were in [[Hereford]], where they visited [[Hereford Cathedral]] and the Gaol designed by his friend John Nash.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.200</ref> Continuing on they reached [[Ross-on-Wye]]. from where they journeyed down the [[River Wye]] stopping at [[Tintern Abbey]], glimpsed [[Piercefield House]] one of Soane's designs and arriving in [[Chepstow]]. Before moving on to [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Gloucester]] where they spent the night. The next day they headed for [[Cheltenham]], returning through the [[Cotswolds]].

Soane was taken ill on 27 December 1813 and was incapacitated until 28 March 1814, when he underwent an operation by [[Astley Cooper]] on his bladder to remove a [[fistula]].<ref>Stroud, 1984, P.97</ref> 

For the first time since his Grand Tour Soane decided to travel abroad, he set off on 15 August 1815 for Paris returning on 5 September.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.226</ref> In the summer of 1816 Soane's and his late wife's mutual friend [[Barbara Hofland]], persuaded him to take a holiday in [[Harrogate]],<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.258">Darley, 1999, P.258</ref> there they visited [[Knaresborough]], [[Plompton]] and its rocks, [[Ripon]], [[Newby Hall]], [[Fountains Abbey]] and [[Studley Royal Park]], [[Castle Howard]], [[Harewood House]] and [[Masham]].<ref>Darley, P.241</ref>

Soane visited Paris again in 1819, setting off on 21 August, he travelled via [[Dunkirk]], [[Abbeville]] and [[Beauvais]] arriving in Paris.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.255</ref> He stayed at 10 rue Vivienne, over the following days he visited, the [[Pont de Neuilly]], [[Les Invalides]], Palais du Roi de Rome, [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise Cemetery]], [[<U+00C9>tienne-Louis Boull<U+00E9>e]]'s chapel at Sainte-Roche, the [[Arc de Triomphe]],<ref>Darley, 1999, P.256</ref> [[Vincennes]] and the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Vincennes]], [[S<U+00E8>vres]], [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Arcueil]] with its ancient [[Roman aqueduct]], [[Basilica of St Denis]], [[Chamber of Deputies of France]], [[Saint-<U+00C9>tienne-du-Mont]], [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre]], [[Luxembourg Palace]], [[Palace of Versailles]] with the [[Grand Trianon]] and [[Petit Trianon]] with its [[Hameau de la reine]], Halle aux bl<U+00E9>s, Halle aux vins, [[Jardin des Plantes]], [[Bassin de la Villette]] with its Rotonde de la Villette by [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]],<ref>Darley, 1999, P.257</ref> [[Tuileries Palace]], [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Malmaison]], he failed to gain admission to the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Bagatelle]], he travelled home via [[Amiens]] and [[Amiens Cathedral]], Abbeville, stopping of to visit [[Canterbury]] and  [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.258"/>

On 24 December 1825 Soane underwent an operation to have a [[cataract]] removed from his eye.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.109"/>

In 1835 Soane had this to say:<ref>Stroud, P.21</ref>
<blockquote>
Devoted to Architecture from my childhood, I have through my life pursued it with the enthusiasm of a passion.
</blockquote>

===Friends===
[[File:Soane Museum 5.jpg|thumb|right|12, 13 & 14 Lincoln's Inn Fields]]
Soane included many members of the Royal Academy as friends including [[J. M. W. Turner]], who was professor of drawing at the Royal Academy, with whom he spent the Christmas after his wife's death<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.100"/> as well as owning three works by the artist; [[John Flaxman]] was an old friend, he was professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy and Soane also acquired several plastercasts of Flaxman's work for his museum; [[Thomas Banks]] again Soane owned sculptures by him;<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.101"/> [[Thomas Lawrence]] who painted Soane's portrait;<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.109"/> despite falling out with his old master, George Dance the Younger, they were firm friends after his death Soane purchased Dance's drawings; after the death of his other teacher Henry Holland, Soane tried to buy his drawings and papers, but found they had been destroyed, but did purchase some of his antique sculptures;<ref>Stroud, 1966, P.152</ref> despite being rivals Soane got on with fellow architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], they often dined together.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.292</ref> Soane called on [[William Thomas Beckford]] both in London and when he was taking the waters in [[Bath, Somerset]] in 1829.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.60"/> Soane had other friends including: [[James Perry (journalist)|James Perry]], [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]], [[Barbara Hofland]].<ref>Waterfield, P.45</ref> As well as several lifelong friendships he formed while on the Grand Tour, including Rowland Burdon.

===Death and funeral===
Soane died, a widower and estranged from his surviving son George, who he felt had betrayed him, contributing to his own mother's death. Having caught a chill, Soane died in 13 Lincoln's Inn Field at half past three on Friday 20 January 1837,.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.115">Stroud, 1984, P.115</ref> His [[obituary]] appeared in the Monday 23 January edition of ''[[The Times]]''. Following a private funeral service, at his own request it was 'plain without ostentation or parade'<ref>Darley, 1999, P.316</ref> he was buried in the same vault as his wife and elder son.<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.115"/>

Within days of his father's death George Soane, left an annuity of <U+00A3>52 per annum, challenged Soane's will. Soane stated that he was left so little because 'his general misconduct and constant opposition to my wishes evinced in the general tenor of his life'. To his daughter-in-law Agnes he left <U+00A3>40 per annum 'not to be subject to the debts or control of her said husband'.<ref>Darley, 1999, p.319</ref> The grounds for overthrowing the will were that his father was insane. On 1 August 1837 the judge at the [[Prerogative court]] rejected the challenge. George appealed but on 26 November dropped his suit.<ref>Darley, 1999, P.320</ref>

==Pupils and assistants==
From 1784 Soane took a new pupil on roughly ever other year,<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.76"/> these were:<ref name="Colvin, 1978, P.767">Colvin, 1978, P.767</ref> J. Adams, George Bailey, [[George Basevi]], S. Burchell, H. Burgess, J. Buxton, [[Robert Dennis Chantrell]], Thomas Chawner, F. Copland, E. Davis, E. Foxall, J.H. Good, Thomas Jeans, [[David Laing (architect)|David Laing]], C. Malton, John McDonnell, A.P. Mee, Frederick Meyer, [[David Mocatta]], Henry Parke, C.E. Papendick, David Richardson, W.E. Rolfe, [[John Sanders (architect)|John Sanders]] his first pupil taken on 1 September 1784,<ref name="Stroud, 1984, P.58"/> H.H. Seward, Thomas Sword, B.J. Storace, Charles Tyrrell and Thomas Williams. His most famous and successful pupil was [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]], though thanks to a personality clash with Soane, Smirke stayed less than a year.<ref>Darley, 1999, pp. 137<U+2013>8</ref>

His main assistants that he employed at various times were:<ref name="Colvin, 1978, P.767"/> [[Joseph Gandy]] who prepared many of the perspective drawings of Soane's designs, Christopher Ebdon, J.W. Hiort, G.E. Ives, William Lodder, R. Morrison, D. Paton, [[George Allen Underwood]] and [[George Wightwick]] (also Soane's final pupil).

The office routine for both assistants and pupils was in summer to work from seven in the morning to seven at night Monday to Saturday and in winter eight to eight, often assistants and pupils would be sent out to supervise building work on site.<ref>Stroud, 1984, Page 65</ref> Students would be given time off to study at the Royal Academy and for holidays.<ref name="Darley, 1999, P.76"/> The Students' room at the museum still exists, it is a [[mezzanine]] at the rear of the building, lined with two long wooden benches with stools, surrounded by plastercasts of [[Classical architecture|classical architectural]] details and lit by a long [[skylight]].<ref>Knox, 2009, P.78</ref> The students were trained in surveying, measuring, costing, superintendence and draftsmanship, normally a student stayed for five to seven years.<ref name="Kostof, 2000, P.197">Kostof, 2000, P.197</ref> 

As an example Robert Dennis Chantrell's indentures were signed on 14 January 1807 just after he was fourteen (a typical age to join the office), his [[apprenticeship]] was to last for seven years, at a cost of one hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|Guineas]] (early in Soane's career he charged <U+00A3>50 and this grew to 175 guineas<ref name="Kostof, 2000, P.197"/>), Soane would provide 'board, lodgings and wearing apparel'; Chantrell only arrived in the office on 15 June 1807. It was normal to serve a probationary period of a few weeks.<ref>Webster, 2010, P.56</ref>

In 1788 Soane defined the professional responsibility of an architect:<ref>Kostof, 2000, P.194</ref>
<blockquote>
The business of the architect is to make the designs and estimates, to direct the works and to measure and value the different parts; he is the intermediate agent between the employer, whose honour and interest he is to study, and the mechanic, whose rights he is to defend. His situation implies great trust; he is responsible for the mistakes, negligences, and ignorances of those he employs; and above all, he is to take care that the workmen's bills do not exceed his own estimates. If these are the duties of an architect, with what propriety can his situation and that of the builder, or the contractor be united? 
</blockquote>
