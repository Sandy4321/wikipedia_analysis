'''''Admiral Makarov''''' was the second of the four {{sclass|Bayan|cruiser|0}} [[armoured cruiser]]s built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in France during the mid-1900s. While initially assigned to the [[Baltic Fleet]], the ship was detached to the [[Mediterranean]] several times before the start of [[World War I]] in 1914. She was modified to lay [[naval mine|mines]] shortly after the war began. ''Admiral Makarov'' laid mines herself and provided cover for other ships laying [[minefield]]s. The ship fought several inconclusive battles with German ships during the war, including the [[Battle of <U+00C5>land Islands]] in mid-1915. She also defended [[Moon Sound]] during [[Operation Albion|the German invasion of the Estonian islands]] in late 1917. ''Admiral Makarov'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1918 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1922.

==Design and description==
''Admiral Makarov'' was {{convert|449.6|ft|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a maximum [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|57.5|ft|1}}, a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|1}} and displaced {{convert|7750|LT|t}}. The ship had a crew of 568 officers and men. ''Admiral Makarov'' was named in honour of [[Admiral]] [[Stepan Makarov]].<ref name=m5>McLaughlin, p. 75</ref>

The ship had two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] with a designed total of {{convert|16500|ihp|kW|lk=in|0}} intended to propel the cruiser at {{convert|21|kn|lk=in}}.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 190</ref> However, during [[sea trial]]s, they developed {{convert|19320|ihp|kW|lk=in}} and drove the ship to a maximum speed of {{convert|22.55|kn}}. Steam for the engines was provided by 26 [[Belleville boiler]]s. She could carry a maximum of {{convert|1100|LT|t|0}} of coal, although her range is unknown.<ref name=m5/>

''Admiral Makarov''{{'}}s main armament consisted of two {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] guns in single [[gun turret|turrets]] fore and aft. Her eight {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} gun were mounted in [[casemate]]s on the sides of the ship's hull.<ref name=w0>Watts, p. 100</ref> Anti-[[torpedo boat]] defense was provided by twenty {{convert|75|mm|adj=on}} 50-calibre guns; eight of these were mounted in casemates on the side of the hull and in the superstructure. The remaining guns were located above the six-inch gun casemates in pivot mounts with [[gun shield]]s. ''Admiral Makarov'' also mounted four {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The ship also had two submerged {{convert|15|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one mounted on each [[broadside]].<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 68, 75</ref>

The ship used [[Krupp armour]] throughout. Her [[Belt armor|waterline belt]] was {{convert|190|mm|1}} thick over her machinery spaces. Fore and aft, it reduced to {{convert|90|mm|1}}. The upper belt and the casemates were {{convert|60|mm|1}} thick. The armour [[deck (ship)|deck]] was {{convert|50|mm|0}} thick; over the central [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] it was a single plate, but elsewhere it consisted of a {{convert|30|mm|adj=on}} plate over two {{convert|10|mm|adj=on}} plates. The gun turrets were protected by {{convert|132|mm}} of armour and  the [[conning tower]] had walls {{convert|136|mm}} thick.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 68</ref>

==Service==
''Admiral Makarov'' was built by [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e|Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e]] in [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]], [[France]]. The ship was [[laid down]] in April 1905, and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 May 1906. ''Admiral Makarov'' was completed in April 1908.<ref>Watts, p. 99</ref> The ship sailed for the Baltic on 27 May and reached [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] on 11 June where she was assigned to the Baltic Fleet. A few months later, she returned to the Mediterranean and provided assistance to the survivor of the [[1908 Messina earthquake|Messina earthquake]] in December. The ship then rejoined the Baltic Fleet, but she was transferred back to Mediterranean in 1910 where she represented the Russian Empire, together with the [[battleship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, the armored cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Rurik|1906|2}}, and the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bogatyr||2}}, at the coronation of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in August 1910.<ref name=m8/> ''Admiral Makarov'' was back in the Baltic during 1911 and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in 1912. The following year, the ship was one of a group of cruisers that visited [[Brest, France]], the [[Isle of Portland]] in Great Britain, and [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]].<ref name=m8>McLaughlin, p. 78</ref>

When World War I began, ''Admiral Makarov'' was assigned to the First Cruiser Brigade.<ref name=m8/> On 17 August, the ship, together with the armored cruiser {{ship|Russian cruiser|Gromoboi||2}}, encountered two German [[light cruiser]]s and an auxiliary [[minelayer]] near the entrance to the [[Gulf of Finland]] en route to lay a [[minefield]] at the entrance. The Russian commander refused combat because he mistakenly thought that the Germans had two additional armored cruisers with them. Shortly afterward, ''Admiral Makarov'' was modified to carry mines. She laid her first mines in early December when she was one of a group of ships that mined the northern and western entrances to the [[Gulf of Danzig]]. The following month, she provided cover as other cruisers laid minefields in the western [[Baltic Sea]], near [[Bornholm]] and [[R<U+00FC>gen]] Islands on the night of 12 January 1915. On 13 February, the ship was en route to cover another minelaying [[sortie]] in the Gulf of Danzig, when ''Rurik'' ran aground in fog off [[F<U+00E5>r<U+00F6>]] Island. She was pulled off despite taking {{convert|2400|LT}} of water aboard, and ''Admiral Makarov'' escorted the damaged ship back home. Together with her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bayan|1907|2}} and two protected cruisers, she fought a brief and inconclusive action with the light cruiser {{SMS|M<U+00FC>nchen}} during the night of 6/7 May while covering a minelaying sortie off [[Liep<U+0101>ja|Libau]].<ref>Halperin, pp. 184, 186<U+2013>87, 192</ref>

On 2 July, the ship participated in the Battle of <U+00C5>land Islands when intercepted and decoded [[wireless]] signals informed the Russians that a small German force was at sea to lay a minefield off the [[<U+00C5>land Islands]]. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Mikhail Bakhirev]] was already at sea with ''Admiral Makarov'', ''Bayan'', ''Rurik'', the protected cruisers ''Bogatyr'' and {{ship|Russian cruiser|Oleg||2}}, and the destroyer {{ship|Russian destroyer|Novik|1911|2}} en route to bombard [[Klaip<U+0117>da|Memel]]. ''Rurik'' and ''Novik'' got separated from the others in fog, but the rest of the force encountered the light cruiser {{SMS|Augsburg}} and a number of destroyers escorting the minelayer {{SMS|Albatross|1907|6}}. The Russians concentrated on ''Albatross'', which was forced to run aground in Swedish territorial waters, while the faster ''Augsburg'' escaped to the south. The Russian cruisers were low on ammunition when they encountered two more German cruisers and broke off the action after exchanging fire.<ref>Halperin, pp. 194<U+2013>95</ref>

When the German launched Operation Albion, the invasion of the [[Estonia]]n islands of [[Saaremaa]] (<U+00D6>sel), [[Hiiumaa]] (Dag<U+00F6>) and [[Muhu]] (Moon), on 11 October 1917, ''Admiral Makarov'' was in [[Finland]], although she was assigned to the naval forces defending the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ship arrived in Moon Sound on 14 October and engaged German destroyers attempting to enter the Sound from the west until ordered to withdraw on 19 October.<ref>Staff, pp. 6, 67, 85, 97, 101, 139</ref>

The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] required the Soviets to evacuate their base at [[Helsinki]] in March 1918 or have the ships based there interned by newly independent [[Finland]] even though the [[Gulf of Finland]] was still frozen over. ''Admiral Makarov'' was among the first group of ships that sailed on 25 March and reached [[Kronstadt]] five days later in what became known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet|'Ice Voyage']]. She was [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] upon arrival and did not participate in the Russian Civil War. The ship was sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up in [[Stettin]].<ref name=m8/>
