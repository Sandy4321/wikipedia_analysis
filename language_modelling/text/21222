'''Owen Schmitt''' (born [[February 13]], [[1985]] in {{city-state|Gilman|Wisconsin}}) is an [[American football]] [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] of the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the Seahawks in the fifth round of the [[2008 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]].

==Early years==
Schmitt played fullback, [[defensive end]], and [[linebacker]] at first [[Paul VI Catholic High School]] and then [[Fairfax High School]] in Virginia.

==Collegiate career==
===Wisconsin-River Falls===
After graduation from high school, Schmitt left to attend the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. However, his grades kept him out of Maryland and instead he enrolled at [[University of Wisconsin-River Falls|Wisconsin-River Falls]]. At River Falls, he posted a 1063yd and five touchdown performance his freshman year, which earned him [[Division III]] all-conference honors in only nine starting performances.

===West Virginia===
Schmitt attended spring practice the next year at [[West Virginia University]]. Schmitt walked-on to the Mountaineers' squad, and was the starter for the [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|2005]] season. Schmitt's sophomore season was his breakout year. He blocked for various runners, but after the mid-point of the season, freshman [[Steve Slaton]] earned starting duties at [[halfback (American football)|halfback]]. Along with quarterback [[Patrick White (American football)|Pat White]], Schmitt and Slaton teamed up to make one of the best rushing attacks in the [[NCAA]]. Schmitt totaled 380 yds and two scores, while running back Slaton recorded 1128 yds.

In [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season|2006]], Slaton, White, and Schmitt were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'s'' regional "Big Man On Campus" article. With high expectations, the Mountaineers posted an 11-2 record. Schmitt rushed for 351 yds and seven touchdowns on the season, also totaling a receiving score. Slaton rushed for 1744 yds, due in large part to Schmitt's lead blocking. Schmitt's biggest game was in the come-from-behind bowl game win against [[2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]], where Schmitt filled in for the injured Steve Slaton, rushing for 109 yds and two scores.

Schmitt earned [[NSCA]] Strength All-American honors at the end of the season, as he bulked up from 245 pounds to 260. After the season he was named "College football's top workout freak" by ESPN.com.<ref name=ESPN022206>Bruce Feldman, [http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=2339239&name=feldman_bruce College football's top workout freaks], ESPN.com, February 22, 2006, Accessed June 8, 2008.</ref>

In [[2007 NCAA Division I-A football season|2007]], his senior year, Schmitt was arguably one of the best fullbacks in the NCAA. Schmitt took many snaps at tight end in spring practice, where head coach [[Rich Rodriguez]] lined him up occasionally. Schmitt's first big game of the season came against [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] when Schmitt rushed four times for 46yd, including a 44 yd dash early in the 31-14 win. According to [[ESPN]] during the Maryland game, Schmitt has broken eight face masks in his career. In the next game against [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]], Schmitt rushed for 32 yds on four rushes with two receptions for 9yd. Against [[Syracuse Orange#Football history|Syracuse]] at the [[Carrier Dome]], Schmitt earned [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] honors for the game with 39 yds on eight rushes for two touchdowns. He also had a 31yd reception(where he hurdled one defender and rumbled over another) and a 27 yd punt that was downed inside the Syracuse ten-yard line on a trick play. In the 28-23 victory over #22 [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], Schmitt rushed for 19 yd on six carries, including the first score of the ballgame with a 4yd touchdown rush. Now Owen has 10 broken facemasks, coming off of the Louisville and Cincinnati games. Unfortunately West Virginia suffered a heartbreaking loss to Pitt the last game of the season which knocked them out of the National Championship picture and matched them up with [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] in the [[Fiesta Bowl]].

Schmitt was awarded the [[Ira Rodgers|Ira Errett Rodgers Award]] and [[Fred Schaus]] Captain's Award at the end of the season by head coach Rich Rodriguez. Schmitt finished out his collegiate career with three rushes for 64yd and a touchdown in the 48-28 Fiesta Bowl victory over Oklahoma. Schmitt's 57 yd touchdown was a career-long and was a school bowl record until [[Noel Devine]] broke the record in the fourth quarter of that same game. It also marked the third consecutive bowl that Schmitt finished with a 50 yd rush.

Schmitt ended the season with 106 knockdown blocks and 17 touchdown-resulting blocks and finished the season with two of his three "pooch" punts downed inside the 20yd line, for an average of 20.3yd per punt.

In Schmitt's career, he earned 21 career starts, four of which were at tight end. Through his 353 career carries (at WVU and Wisconsin-River Falls), he was only tackled for a loss four times. He also carried the ball for 1003yd, a 6.3yd average, during his Mountaineer career. In his four collegiate seasons, Schmitt totaled 122 points and 2,398 all-purpose yards.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/owen-schmitt?id=312 NFL Events: Combine Player Profiles - Owen Schmitt]</ref>

At [[West Virginia University|West Virginia's]] Pro Day on March 13, Schmitt ran a 4.72 40, a 4.11 short shuttle, a 6.85 three-cone, and an 11.85 long shuttle. He measured in at 6'2" and {{convert|249|lb|abbr=on}}.
