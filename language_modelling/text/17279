A talented footballer, he helped them to win a host of trophies in the mid sixties to early seventies.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

He went freelance aged 20 and, with the encouragement of his agent, went to live in [[Guernsey]] aged 21 in 1963. There he played for St Martin's FC and between 1963 and 1965 won several more titles and trophies.{{cn|date=February 2014}} It was there he met his future wife,{{cn|date=February 2014}} Ann, who he married in 1967.<ref name=obit /> However the distractions of life in Guernsey proved too much and Tony started missing his deadlines, so he returned to London.{{cn|date=February 2014}} In 1972 he moved to [[Shanklin]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], continuing to work freelance from home. On Saturdays he continued to play football, this time for Rookley FC, playing over 300 games in total and winning many more trophies,<ref name=obit /> only hanging up his boots aged 43 with a dodgy knee.{{cn|date=February 2014}} He was voted Life President of Rookley Football Club due to his many years of faithful service as player and captain.<ref name=obit />

Originally a Catholic, he became a born-again Christian in 1980, joining the Isle of Wight [[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International|Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship]], of which he became Vice-President, and the Sacred Heart of Jesus Music Group. He became an Independent Arts teacher, using art to help people recovering from strokes and people with disabilities, and a carer at the [[Isle of Wight NHS Trust|Sevenacres mental health unit]]. He founded the Isle of Wight Re-Cycle project, collecting bicycles for Africa.<ref name=obit />

Work in comics began to dry up in the early 1990s after ''Roy of the Rovers'' and ''The Victor'' ceased publication. He did some work in the late 1990s for ''Football Picture Story Monthly'' and a soccer comic in the USA, and left comics in 2000.{{cn|date=February 2014}} He suffered from an irregular heartbeat, and died suddenly on 12 January 2014, aged 72, while returning from work at the Afton ward at Sevenacres.<ref name=obit />

==Comics work==
One of Harding's earliest strips was "Wonder Man" for ''[[The Victor (comics)|The Victor]]'' in 1961-62. A revival of on an old prose serial from ''[[The Rover (story paper)|The Rover]]'' from 1946, it starred H. K. Rodd, a young man raised by scientists to be the perfect athlete. Another early strip was "Bouncing Briggs", which first appeared in ''[[Hornet (DC Thomson)|The Hornet]]'' in 1963. Subtitled "the goalie who's good for a laugh", it featured Bernard Briggs, a young scrap metal dealer who became goalkeeper for Blackton Rovers after calling at the club grounds to collect some iron railings, and criticising their goalkeeper so loudly the team challenged him to have a go himself. The strip ran in ''The Hornet'' until 1976, and from then in ''[[The Hotspur]]'' until 1980.<ref name=gifford>Denis Gifford, ''Encyclopedia of Comic Characters'', Longman, 1987, pp. 20, 245</ref> 

Harding drew various strips for ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]'' between 1976 and 1993, but it was only in the annuals that he got to illustrate the adventures of [[Roy Race]] himself. In 1976-77 he drew the controversial football strip "Look Out For Lefty", written by [[Tom Tully (writer)|Tom Tully]], for ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'', taking over from his friend Barrie Mitchell. Harding regarded it as a "cheeky", humorous story,<ref name=bottle>[http://www.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/?p=918 How Lefty lost his Bottle], SevenPennyNightmare.co.uk]</ref> but objected to some of the things he was asked to draw, for example refusing to depict Lefty sticking two fingers up to the crowd.<ref>[http://www.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/?p=557 The Whole Story: Look Out for Lefty!], SevenPennyNightmare.co.uk</ref> He did draw a scene involving a character throwing a bottle from the crowd and hitting a player on the head, thinking the player was "such a horror" he deserved it.<ref name=bottle /> This story caused controversy, making the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' under the headline "Comic Strip Hooligans".<ref>Joe Steeples, "Comic Strip Hooligans", ''Daily Mail'', 17 September 1976, [http://www.sevenpennynightmare.co.uk/?p=317 reprinted at SevenPennyNightmare.co.uk]</ref>

Other comic strips he drew include:

*"Bobby of the Blues", ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher]]'', January 1970-June 1971
*"The Footballer Who Wouldn't Stay Dead", ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]''
*"Roy's Action Replay", ''All Action Monthly'', [[Fleetway]], 1987
*"The Safest Hands in Soccer", ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]''
*"This Goalie's Got Guts", ''Scoop'', 1978-81
*"Twisty", ''[[Bullet (DC Thomson)|Bullet]]'', 1976-78
