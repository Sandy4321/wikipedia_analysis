'''Heinrich Alexander Ludwig Peter Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein'''<ref group="Notes">{{German rank|Prinz}}</ref> (14&nbsp;August 1916 &ndash; 21&nbsp;January 1944) was a German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[night fighter]] [[flying ace]] of aristocratic descent during [[World War II]]. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> At the time of his death, he was the highest scoring night fighter pilot in the [[Luftwaffe]] and still the third highest by the end of [[World War II]].<ref group="Notes">For a list of Luftwaffe night fighter aces see ''[[List of German World War II night fighter aces]]''</ref>

Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein was born on 14 August 1916 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] and joined the cavalry of the German [[Wehrmacht]] in the spring of 1937. He was accepted for flight training and transferred to the emerging ''Luftwaffe''. He initially served as an observer and later as pilot in [[Kampfgeschwader 1]] (KG 1) and [[Kampfgeschwader 51]] (KG 51). With these units he fought in the [[Battle of France]], [[Battle of Britain]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, before he transferred to the night fighter force. He claimed his first aerial victory on the night of 6 to 7 May 1942. By October 1942, he had accumulated 22 aerial victories for which he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'') on 7 October 1942. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves (mit Eichenlaub)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') on 31 August 1943, for 54 aerial victories. He was tasked with the leadership of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (NJG&nbsp;2) in January 1944, before he was [[killed in action]] on the night of 21 January 1944<!--  after he had shot down his 83rd enemy aircraft -->. Posthumously he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross#Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern)|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern'').<ref>''Helden der Wehrmacht II'' 2003, pp. 186<U+2013>187.</ref>

==Personal life==
Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein was born on 14&nbsp;August 1916 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] as a member of the aristocratic family [[Sayn-Wittgenstein]]. He was the second of three sons of Gustav Alexander Prince zu Sayn-Wittgenstein (1880&ndash;1953), a diplomat at the German embassy in Copenhagen, and his wife, Walburga, Baroness von Friesen (1885&ndash;1970). His brother Ludwig was older and Alexander younger.<ref name="Knott p29">Knott 2008, p. 29.</ref> Sayn-Wittgenstein was a descendant of Russian Field Marshal Prince [[Peter Wittgenstein|Peter Khristianovich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein Berleburg]], a prominent commander in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]].<ref>Knott 2008, p. 111.</ref>

Sayn-Wittgenstein attended numerous schools in numerous locations. These included a private tutor at [[Lake Geneva]], a boarding school in [[Neubeuern]] in [[Upper Bavaria]], a brief stay at [[Davos]] in Switzerland, and a private school in [[Montreux]]. He received his ''[[Abitur]]'' from the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'', a higher education facility, in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] on 17 December 1935.<ref name="Knott p29"/><ref>Knott 2008, p. 32.</ref>

He joined the [[Hitler Youth]] on 12&nbsp;April 1932 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]. On 15&nbsp;January 1933, he became a ''Kameradschaftsf<U+00FC>hrer'' (group leader). From Easter 1933 until fall of 1933 he led the group's military-sports activities as a ''Wehrsportleiter''. He then became head of the instruction unit (''Ausbildungsschar'') until May 1934. From June 1934 he led the work unit 2/1/113 (''Gefolgschaft'') and received further pre-military sports training at the different camps of the unit 113 (''Bann'') and at the Regional Leaders' School (''Gebietsf<U+00FC>hrerschule'').<ref name="Knott p29"/>

==Military career==
In April 1937, Sayn-Wittgenstein decided on a military career and joined the 17. ''Kavallerie-Regiment'' (17th Cavalry Regiment) in [[Bamberg]]. He transferred to the ''Luftwaffe'' in the summer of 1937 and, in October 1937, he was accepted at the flight training school in [[Braunschweig]]. He received his officer's commission and was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (second lieutenant) in June 1938.<ref>Knott 2008, p. 34.</ref> Sayn-Wittgenstein served on various air bases from where he flew the [[Junkers Ju 88]] and the [[Heinkel He 111]]. In the winter of 1938&ndash;39 he served as a ''Kampfbeobachter'' (combat observer or navigator) in [[Kampfgeschwader 54]] (KG 54&mdash;54th Bomber Wing) based at [[Fritzlar]].<ref name="Knott p38">Knott 2008, p. 38.</ref><ref group="Notes">For an explanation of the meaning of Luftwaffe unit designation see [[Luftwaffe Organization]]</ref>

===With the bomber arm===
After the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, Sayn-Wittgenstein experienced his first combat action on the [[Western Front]] in the [[Battle of France]] and, later, during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Initially he served as an observer on the He 111 H-3 from [[Kampfgeschwader 1]] "Hindenburg,", piloted by Gerhard Baeker, with whom he flew high-altitude missions against the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) airfield at [[Biggin Hill]].<ref name="Knott p38">Knott 2008, p. 38.</ref>

In the winter of 1940&ndash;41, Sayn-Wittgenstein returned to pilot school and took his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate 2 (''Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugf<U+00FC>hrerschein 2''), also known as 'C2'-Certificate, confirming proficiency for blind-flying, a necessary pre-requisite for night duty, and returned to a combat unit in March 1941. In preparation for [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, his unit moved to [[Eichwalde]] in [[East Prussia]]. In support of [[Heeresgruppe Nord]] (Army Group North), KG 1 flew its first missions against [[Liep<U+0101>ja]] and then [[Jelgava]] and [[Riga]], targeting the heavily-occupied enemy airfields.<ref name="Knott p45">Knott 2008, p. 45.</ref>

In August 1941, Sayn-Wittgenstein transferred to the night fighter force. By this time, he had flown 150&nbsp;combat missions and was awarded both classes of the [[Iron Cross]] (''Eisernes Kreuz''), [[Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe|Honour Goblet of the Luftwaffe]] (''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe'') and the [[Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe]] for Bomber Pilots in Gold (''Frontflugspange f<U+00FC>r Kampfflieger in Gold'').<ref name="Knott p45"/><ref name="Berger p312">Berger 2000, p. 312.</ref>

===Night fighter===
Sayn-Wittgenstein had left KG 51&nbsp;by January 1942, after he had volunteered for the night fighter force and been appointed ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' (squadron leader) of the 9./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (9./NJG 2&mdash;9th Squadron of the 2nd Night Fighter Wing) on 1 November 1941.<ref name="Obermaier p34">Obermaier 1989, p. 34.</ref> He claimed his first nocturnal victory&mdash;a [[Bristol Blenheim]] {{convert|40|km|mi}} west of [[Walcheren]]&mdash;on the night of 6 May 1942, while serving with the ''Eg<U+00E4>nzungsgruppe'' (Supplementary Group) of NJG 2.<ref name="Knott p73">Knott 2008, p. 73.</ref> He shot down three aircraft in both the nights of 31 July 1942 (victories 15&ndash;17) and 10 September 1942 (victories 19&ndash;21). Sayn-Wittgenstein received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes'')  on 7 October 1942, after 22&nbsp;aerial victories.<ref name="Obermaier p34"/> The award was presented by General [[Josef Kammhuber]], after which they both inspect the personnel of 9./NJG 2.<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 81<U+2013>82.</ref>

[[File:Junkers Ju 88 RAF Hendon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|A Ju 88 night fighter with the [[Lichtenstein radar|FuG 202 Lichtenstein B/C]] radar installation similar to those flown by Sayn-Wittgenstein]]
''[[Hauptmann]]'' (captain) Sayn-Wittgenstein was moved to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in February 1943 after he had been appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the IV./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 5]] (IV./NJG 5&mdash;4th Group of the 5th Night Fighter Wing) on 1 December 1942. Here ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' Herbert K<U+00FC>mmritz joined Sayn-Wittgenstein's crew as his radio and wireless operator (''Bordfunker''). K<U+00FC>mmritz at this time already had six months of operation experience on board a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] serving with the II./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3]] (II./NJG 3&mdash;2nd Group of the 3rd Night Fighter Wing) stationed at [[Stade]]. K<U+00FC>mmeritz had studied  [[high frequency]] technology at the [[Telefunken]] Company in Berlin before World War II. Prior to K<U+00FC>mmeritz, Sayn-Wittgenstein had rejected all his previous radio operators after only a few missions.<ref>Hinchliffe 1998, p. 125.</ref> In March and April 1943, Kammhuber ordered IV./NJG 5 to relocate to [[Rennes]], France in defense of the German [[U-boat]] bases.<ref name="Knott p74">Knott 2008, p. 74.</ref>

Stationed at [[Gilze-Rijen]] the order was issued to convert to the Bf 110 night fighter. Sayn-Wittgenstein flew the Bf 110 for one short flight only, but on the night of 24 June 1943, the aircraft had technical problems and was considered unserviceable. K<U+00FC>mmeritz and Sayn-Wittgenstein took off in their usual Ju 88&nbsp;C and shot down four [[Avro Lancaster]] bombers (victories 32&ndash;35). Sayn-Wittgenstein never flew another Bf 110 again, preferring his Ju 88 over the Bf 110.<ref name="Obermaier p34"/><ref name="Knott p74"/> The group was relocated to the Eastern Front again and redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 100]] (I./NJG 100&mdash;1st Group of the 100th Night Fighter Wing) on 1 August 1943. While stationed at [[Insterburg]], [[East Prussia]], Sayn-Wittgenstein shot down seven aircraft in one mission, six of them within 47&nbsp;minutes (victories 36<U+2013>41), in the area north-east of [[Oryol]] on 20 July 1943.<ref name="Obermaier p34"/><ref name="Knott p73">Knott 2008, p. 73.</ref>

Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed three more victories on 1 August 1943 (victories 44<U+2013>46) and three more on the night of 3 August 1943 (victories 48<U+2013>50). He was appointed ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of the II./NJG 3 on 15 August 1943. Sayn-Wittgenstein became the 290th recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub'') after 54&nbsp;aerial victories on 31 August 1943. The award was presented at the [[F<U+00FC>hrerhauptquartier]] in [[East Prussia]] on 22 September 1943.<ref name="Knott p98">Knott 2008, p. 98.</ref> For these achievements he also received a letter from the commanding general of the [[4th Fighter Division (Germany)|4. ''Jagd-Division'']] (4th Fighter Division) ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' (lieutenant general) [[Joachim-Friedrich Huth]].<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 100<U+2013>101.</ref>

On 1 December 1943, Sayn-Wittgenstein was ordered to take over command of the II./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2]] (II./NJG 2&mdash;2nd Group of the 2nd Night Fighter Wing). He was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of NJG 2&nbsp;on 1 January 1944; he had already reached 68 aerial victories. He claimed shooting down 6 four-engined Bombers on the same night (victories 69<U+2013>74).<ref name="Obermaier p34"/> In late 1943, his wireless operator K<U+00FC>mmeritz went on a study leave and was replaced by ''[[Feldwebel]]'' (sergeant or warrant officer) Friedrich Ostheimer, who flew with Sayn-Wittgenstein from October 1943 until January 1944.<ref name="Knott p100">Knott 2008, p. 100.</ref>

On the night of 20 January 1944 Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed three enemy aircraft shot down in the Berlin area (victories 76<U+2013>78). He almost collided with the third burning Lancaster which went into a dive and came very close to his own Ju 88. The Ju 88 went out of control and Sayn-Wittgenstein regained control of his just flyable aircraft. His radio operator on this mission, ''Feldwebel'' Friedrich Ostheimer established contact with airfield at [[Erfurt]]. Since the aircraft began stalling after the wheels and flaps went down the crew decided to belly-land the aircraft. They discovered that about {{convert|2|m|ft}} of the wing had been cut off by the Lancaster's propeller.<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 104<U+2013>107.</ref><ref>Hinchliffe 1998, pp. 235<U+2013>236</ref>

===Death===
The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, wireless operator Ostheimer and board mechanic ''Unteroffizier'' Kurt Matzuleit took off on a ''[[Zahme Sau]]'' (Tame Boar), a combination of ground controlled and airborne radar, night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju 88&nbsp;R4+XM (''Werknummer'' 750 467&mdash;factory number), which normally was assigned to the Technical Officer of NJG 2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaser was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which hit the ground at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump,<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 107<U+2013>108.</ref> and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.<ref name="knott10809">Knott 2008, pp. 108<U+2013>109.</ref>

Sayn-Wittgenstein's body was found near the wreckage of the Ju 88&nbsp;in a forest area belonging to the municipality of [[Neuermark-L<U+00FC>bars|L<U+00FC>bars]] by [[Stendal]] the next day. His parachute was discovered unopened and it was assumed that he may have hit his head on the [[vertical stabiliser]] of his aircraft when trying to escape. The death certificate listed "closed fracture of the skull and facial bone" as his cause of death. He was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the 44th [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] (''Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern'') on 23 January 1944.<ref name="knott10809"/> Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein had flown 320&nbsp;combat missions, 150&nbsp;of which as a bomber pilot or observer. At the time of his death he was the leading night fighter pilot with 83&nbsp;aerial victories, with 23 of them claimed on the Eastern and and 60&nbsp;on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western front]].<ref name="Obermaier p34"/>

On 25 January 1944, Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein death was announced in the [[Wehrmachtbericht]], an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the [[Wehrmacht]], the name of the unified armed forces of Germany from 1935 to 1945. He was buried on 29 January 1944 in the ''Geschwader'' cemetery at the [[Deelen Air Base]]. His remains were re-interred in 1948. He is now resting next to Prinz [[Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld|Egmont zur Lippe-Wei<U+00DF>enfeld]] at [[Ysselsteyn]] in the [[Netherlands]].<ref>Knott 2008, p. 206.</ref> 

The question who shot down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained convinced that they were shot down by a long range intruder [[de Havilland Mosquito]] night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquito's, two [[Serrate radar detector]]s from [[No. 141 Squadron RAF]] and one from [[No. 239 Squadron RAF]], participated in the attacks on [[Magdeburg]]. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito FII, DZ 303, piloted by [[Flight Sergeant]] Desmon Snape with [[Flying Officer]] L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23:15&nbsp;south of [[Brandenburg]]. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88&nbsp;with its [[Navigation light#Aviation navigation lights|position light]]s on. They attacked the Ju 88&nbsp;and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit, but they did not claim a victory. This encounter exactly matches time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.<ref>Hinchliffe 1998, pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref>

==Personality==
Night fighter pilot [[Wilhelm Johnen]] commented on the arrival of Sayn-Wittgenstein at his unit: "... A madman, I thought, as I took my leave. Once outside I got into conversation with the Prince's crew. Among other things they told me that their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he (the radio operator) had lost his screen [radar contact with the enemy] during a mission."<ref>Knott 2008, p. 76.</ref>

Herbert K<U+00FC>mmeritz recalled that Sayn-Wittgenstein often used his seniority and rank to ensure that he would get the best initial contact with the incoming bombers. He would often wait on the ground until the best contact was established. If another fighter had already engaged the enemy before Wittgentein arrived, the prince would announce on the radio "''Hier Wittgenstein&mdash;geh weg!''" (Wittgenstein here, clear off!)<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 77<U+2013>78.</ref>

[[Wolfgang Falck]] felt that Sayn-Wittgenstein was not officer-material. Falck described him as: "...not the type to be a leader of a unit. He was not a teacher, educator or instructor. But he was an outstanding personality, magnificent fighter and great operational pilot. He had an astonishing sixth sense&mdash;an intuition that permitted him to see and even feel where other aircraft were. It was like a personal radar system. He was an excellent air-to-air shot."<ref>Knott 2008, pp. 78<U+2013>79.</ref>

His mother, Princess Walburga, commented that: "... he was boundlessly disillusioned and boundlessly disappointed. In 1943 he contemplated the thought of shooting Hitler. It was only out of sense of honour and duty that Heinrich went on fighting, carried along by the ambition to overtake ''Major'' [[Helmut Lent|Lent]] in his score of enemy aircraft shot down".<ref name="Knott p108">Knott 2008, p. 108.</ref> In her memoirs, [[Tatjana Metternich]] reported that Wittgenstein planned to kill [[Hitler]] after the ceremony at which he received his [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1943. He said," I am not married, I have no children - I am expendable. He will receive me personally. Who else among us can ever get as near to him?"<ref>Metternich 1976, p. 194.</ref>
