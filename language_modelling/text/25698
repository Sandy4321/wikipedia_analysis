'''George Washington Johnson''' (May 27, 1811{{ndash}}April 8, 1862) was the first [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Confederate governor]] of [[Kentucky]]. A lawyer-turned-farmer from [[Scott County, Kentucky]], Johnson favored secession as a means of preventing the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], believing the Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] would be forces of equal strength, each too wary to attack the other. As political sentiment in the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] took a decidedly Union turn following the elections of 1861, Johnson was instrumental in organizing a sovereignty convention in [[Russellville, Kentucky]] with the intent of "severing forever our connection with the Federal Government."<ref name="bcoref">{{cite web |url=http://www.breathittcounty.com/JCN-2governors.html |title=Kentucky Had Two Confederate Governors |accessdate=2009-06-09|author=Neace, James Clell and Harned, Edgar Porter |date=2000 |format=HTML}}</ref> The convention created a Confederate [[shadow government]] for the Commonwealth, and Johnson was elected its governor.

Despite his meager political experience&mdash;having previously served only three years in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]]&mdash;Johnson labored vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government. Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, but the shadow government's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the [[Confederate Army]] advanced. When [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] abandoned the Confederate capital of [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him. Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm, Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston's army. Johnson was killed at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], making him the only state governor, Union or Confederate, to fall in battle during the Civil War. He was succeeded by [[Richard Hawes]], the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky.

==Early life and career==
George Washington Johnson was born on May 27, 1811 near [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] in Scott County, Kentucky, the son of [[Major (United States)|major]] William and Betsy Payne Johnson.<ref name=brown>"The Government of Confederate Kentucky" in Brown, p. 82</ref><ref name=kye>"Johnson, George W." in Kleber, p. 473</ref><ref name=harrison>Harrison in ''Kentucky Governors'', pp. 82&ndash;84</ref> Major Johnson died soon after the close of the [[War of 1812]], in which he was a participant, and George Johnson was reared in the home of his stepfather, John Allen.<ref name=register3>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 3</ref> Johnson received three degrees from [[Transylvania University]]: an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in 1829, an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] in 1832, and an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in 1833.<ref name=harrison /> On August 20, 1833, he married Ann Eliza Viley, daughter of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] Willa and Lydia Smith Viley.<ref name=powell>"George W. Johnson" in Powell, p. 114</ref> The couple had ten children, seven of whom lived to adulthood.<ref name=kye />

Johnson briefly practiced law in Georgetown, but decided he preferred farming.<ref name=harrison /> He owned a {{convert|300|acre|km2|sing=on}} farm near Georgetown, as well as a {{convert|1000|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation in [[Arkansas]].<ref name=harrison /><ref name="ppcorg">{{cite web |url=http://www.potterflats.com/johnson.html |title=George W. Johnson - A Tribute |accessdate=2009-06-09|author=Berry, Letha |date=2000 |format=HTML |publisher=Pride in Pike County }}</ref> In 1838, Johnson was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=kye /><ref name=powell /> He was offered the nominations for [[lieutenant governor]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U. S. Congressman]], but declined them both.<ref name="ppcorg" /> In August 1845, Johnson headed the Committee of Sixty that seized [[abolitionist]] [[Cassius Clay (1810<U+2013>1903)|Cassius M. Clay]]'s printing press and shipped it to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].<ref name=rose>"George W. Johnson, Governor of Confederate Kentucky" in Rose, pp. 63&ndash;65</ref>

==Civil War==
Although he supported [[John C. Breckinridge]] for president in 1860, he did not feel that [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s election justified secession, since [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s controlled neither [[United States Congress|Congress]] nor the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].<ref name=kye /> As the Confederate States of America were formed, however, Johnson began to lose hope for Kentucky as a part of the Union.<ref name=rose /> Instead, he began to advocate that Kentucky  join the Confederacy, believing that the Union and Confederate nations would be too evenly matched to consider war and would negotiate a free trade agreement that would benefit both.<ref name=rose />

In 1861, Johnson traveled to [[Richmond, Virginia]] to ask [[Jefferson Davis]] to respect Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War.<ref name=harrison /> Following a near sweep of Kentucky's state and federal elections by Union sympathizers, [[William "Bull" Nelson]] established [[Camp Dick Robinson]], a Union recruiting camp, in [[Garrard County, Kentucky|Garrard County]].<ref name=harrison /> Southern sympathizers saw this as a breach of the Commonwealth's neutrality, and called a State Rights Convention on September 10, 1861.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson was among the delegates from seventy [[List of counties in Kentucky|Kentucky counties]] who attended the convention.<ref name=register8>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 8</ref> The delegates elected Richard Hawes as chair, called for a restoration of Kentucky's neutrality in the war, and condemned the Federal government for its "invasion."<ref name=register8 /> This last-minute effort to prevent Kentucky from aiding the Union was unsuccessful, and Johnson, a known Southern sympathizer, fled to [[Virginia]] with Breckinridge and others to avoid potential arrest by Union forces.<ref name=rose /><ref name=perrin>Perrin, p. 598</ref> From Virginia, Johnson traveled through [[Tennessee]] to Bowling Green where, despite his age (49) and a crippled arm, he volunteered as an aid to General [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]].<ref name=kye /><ref name=perrin />

===Russellville Convention===
[[File:Clark House Russellville KY.png|thumb|right|The Clark House in Russellville, Kentucky]]
On October 29, 1861, a group of Kentuckians&mdash;Johnson among them&mdash;met at [[Russellville, Kentucky]] to discuss the formation of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth, believing the Unionist government in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention's final report, and personally introduced some of its key resolutions.<ref name=harrison /> The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson, Breckinridge, and [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]] were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made arrangements for the convention.<ref name=register13>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 13</ref>

On November 18, 1861, 116 delegates representing 68 Kentucky counties convened at the Clark House in Russellville.<ref name=kye-gov>"Confederate State Government" in Kleber, p. 222</ref> Over the next three days, a shadow government was established with Bowling Green as its temporary capital.<ref name=powell /> Johnson was unanimously chosen as governor of the new Confederate state.

===Confederate governor===
On November 21, 1861, Johnson wrote Confederate president Jefferson Davis to request Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy.<ref name=rose /> Though Davis had some reservation about the circumvention of the elected General Assembly in forming the Confederate government, he concluded that Johnson's request had merit.<ref name=rose /> Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861.<ref name=harrison />

During the winter of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the legitimacy of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army.<ref name=rose /> Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the [[Confederate Congress]] in Richmond.<ref name=rose /> Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful.<ref name=rose /> On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3 million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses.<ref name=register20>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 20</ref> The Congress instead approved a sum of $2 million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War [[Judah P. Benjamin]] and President Davis.<ref name=register20 />

During his labors to sustain the provisional government, Johnson's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him. The only family member with whom he had contact was his son Madison ("Matty"), who had joined [[John Hunt Morgan]]'s cavalry. Johnson admired and respected Morgan, and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him. In 1862, he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen-year-old son Junius to serve in the Confederate Army. Despite Johnson's protestations that he would ensure his son's safety, his wife refused this request.<ref name=register1617>Harrison in ''Register'', pp. 16&ndash;17</ref>

It was Johnson's practice to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery pieces that became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed the command of General [[Lloyd Tilghman]], trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed. It is unclear how much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship with most of the Confederate generals.<ref name=register18>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 18</ref>

===Death at the Battle of Shiloh===
[[File:GeorgeWJohnsongrave.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's gravestone in Georgetown Cemetery in Georgetown, Kentucky.]]
When General Albert Sydney Johnston was forced to withdraw his troops from Bowling Green in February 1862, the Confederate state government moved with his army to Tennessee.<ref name=harrison /> On April 6, 1862, General Johnston attacked the Union army at [[Shiloh, Tennessee]].<ref name=harrison /> During this battle, Governor Johnson served as a volunteer aide to General Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue.<ref name=harrison /> After his horse was killed out from under him, Johnson fought on foot with Company E of the Fourth Kentucky Infantry Regiment, and insisted on being sworn in as a [[Private (rank)|private]].<ref name=harrison /> He declared "I will take a good night's rest and be ready for the fight tomorrow."<ref name="bcoref" />

The next day, Governor Johnson was seriously wounded in the right thigh and abdomen.<ref name=harrison /> He lay wounded on the battlefield until the next morning, when he was recognized by Union General [[Alexander McDowell McCook]].<ref name=harrison /> Johnson and McCook had both attended the 1860 [[Democratic National Convention]] and were both [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].<ref name=rose /> Johnson was taken aboard the Union hospital ship ''Hannibal'', where despite the ministrations of several physicians, he died on April 8.<ref name=rose /> Friends in the Union army, including General [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], packed Johnson's body in salt and shipped it to Louisville, then on to Georgetown for burial.<ref name=perrin />
