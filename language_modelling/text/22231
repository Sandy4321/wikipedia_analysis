He was the eldest son of Sardar Yazdan Khan, born in a [[Hazara people|Hazara]] [[Shia Muslim family in [[Quetta]], he was from the Sardar family of the Hazara tribe in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]]. He was a ''[[Naik (military rank)|Naik]]'' (Junior Non-Commissioned Officer) in the '''[[106th Hazara Pioneers]]''' and went to the [[India]]n Military Academy in ''[[Dehradun|Dehra Dun]]'' as a cadet and graduated with the first batch of the British [[King's Commissioned Indian Officer|Indian commissioned officers]] on 1 February 1935.

He took part in the '''[[Waziristan]] Operations''' in 1936-1938 and in '''[[World War II]]''', where he served in [[North Africa]]. He served with distinction in the Pakistani Army and rose to the rank of the commander in chief of [[Military of Pakistan|Pakistan Armed Forces]] during President Mohammad Ayub Khan<U+2019>s regime (1958-1969).

After Gen. Musa retired from the army, President Ayub Khan appointed him as the [[Governor]] of [[West Pakistan]] from 1967 to 1969. After serving for a few years, he retired and settled in [[Karachi]]. In 1987, he was once again involved in politics. He was appointed [[Governor of Balochistan]] Province by the then President General [[Zia-ul-Haq]]. In Balochistan, Governor; General (Retd) Musa dissolved the [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan|provincial assembly]] in December 1988. However, the [[Quetta High Court|Balochistan High Court]] restored the assembly amid public condemnation of Governor's move. The step towards dissolving the assembly was believed to have been taken with the consent of the [[President of Pakistan|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]].

General Mohammed Musa commanded the Army in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], and had overall responsibility for operations throughout the conflict. As Army Chief, he was criticised for not anticipating an assault across the international border. However he was given credit for blunting the Indian offensive towards [[Sialkot]] during the [[Battle of Chawinda]]. He has narrated the events and experiences of the war in his book "My Version". In the book he has given accounts of the secret war that was going on in Kashmir between the two countries, long before the real war actual began.

General Musa Khan is the author of his autobiography, ''[[Jawan]] to General'' in which he describes his lifetime experiences from a simple foot-soldier rising to become a general.

He died on 12 March 1991 in [[Quetta]].
