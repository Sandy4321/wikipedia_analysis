'''Alanya''' (pronounced {{IPA2|<U+02C8><U+00E6>l<U+0259>ny<U+02D0><U+0251>}}) is a seaside resort city and district of [[Antalya Province]] in the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean region of Turkey]], {{nowrap|74.6 miles}} ({{nowrap|120 km}}) from the city of [[Antalya]]. The municipal district, which includes the city center, has close to {{nowrap|400,000 inhabitants}}. The population is almost entirely of [[Anatolia]]n origin, but is home to almost {{nowrap|10,000 [[Demography of Europe|European]]}} residents, with a growing presence in the city and its economy.

Because of its natural strategic position on a small peninsula into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] below the [[Taurus Mountains]], Alanya has been a local stronghold for many [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean-based empires]], including the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire]]s. Alanya's greatest political importance came in the [[Middle Ages]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R<U+00FB>m]] under the rule of [[Alaeddin Keykubad I]], from whom the city derives its name. His building campaign resulted in many of the city's landmarks, such as the [[K<U+0131>z<U+0131>l Kule]] (Red Tower), Tersane (Shipyard), and [[Alanya Castle]].

The relatively moderate [[Mediterranean climate]], natural attractions, and historic heritage makes Alanya a popular destination for tourists, and responsible for 9% of [[Tourism in Turkey|Turkey's tourism sector]]. Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city, resulting in a corresponding increase in city population. Warm-weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya. [[List of mayors of Alanya|Mayor]] Hasan Sipahio<U+011F>lu of the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] has led the city since 1999.

== Names ==
The city has changed hands many times over the centuries, and its name has reflected this.  Alanya was first known in [[Latin]] as ''Coracesium'' or in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] as ''Korakesion'' from the [[Luwian]] ''Korakassa'' meaning "point/protruding city".<ref name=Korekesion/>  Under the [[Byzantine Empire]] it become known as ''Kalonoros'' or ''Kalon Oros'', meaning "beautiful" or "fine mountain" in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name=crane/>  The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] renamed the city ''[[Alaiye]]'' (<U+0639><U+0644><U+0627><U+0639><U+064A><U+0629>), a derivative of the [[Sultan]] [[Alaeddin Keykubad I]]'s name. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Italian traders called the city ''Candelore'' or ''Cardelloro''.<ref name=medici/> In his 1935 visit, [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] finalized the name in the [[Turkish alphabet|new alphabet]] as ''Alanya'', changing the 'i' and 'e' in Alaiye, reportedly because of a misspelled [[Telegraphy|telegram]] in 1933.<ref>{{cite book |url= http://www.happydreamhomes.com/mhia.asp?sp=aainfo&dil=1 |title= D<U+00FC>nden Bug<U+00FC>ne Alanya |accessdate=2007-01-03 |last=Yetkin |first=Ha<U+015F>im |year= 1990 |publisher= Yetkin Da<U+011F>itim |location= [[Antalya]] |accessdate= 2008-02-18}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Alanya has a relatively moderate [[Continental climate|continental]] [[Mediterranean climate]]. The [[Mediterranean Basin]] ensures that most rain comes during the winter, leaving the summers long, hot, and dry, prompting the Alanya board of Tourism to use the slogan "where the sun smiles".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=133604 |title= Summer sun for southern beaches, eastern Anatolia remains icy |work= [[Today's Zaman]] |date= [[February 9]], [[2008]] |accessdate= 2008-02-10}}</ref> Storm cells sometime bring with them fair weather [[waterspout]]s when close to the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherist/comment.html?entrynum=3&tstamp=200610 |title=  	Waterspouts in Alanya |work= [http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherist/show.html Istanbul Journal of Weather] |publisher= Weather Underground |date= [[October 19]], [[2006]] |accessdate= 2008-02-22}}</ref> The presence of the Taurus Mountain in close proximity to the sea causes fog, in turn creating visible rainbows many mornings.

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Alanya kale byzantine church.jpg|thumb|right|Byzantine era church built inside Alanya Castle]]
On the peninsula stands [[Alanya Castle]], a [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] era citadel dating from 1226.  Most major landmarks in the city are found inside and around the castle.  The current castle was built over existing fortifications and served the double purpose of a palace of local government and as a defensive structure in case of attack. In 2007, the city began renovating various sections of the castle area, including adapting a Byzantine church for use as a Christian community center.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://english.yenialanya.com/index.aspx?Tarih=20070128&Mansetim=328&ManRes=engman3 |accessdate=2007-02-13 |date=[[2007-01-28]] |title=Ancient church will be restored |publisher= [http://english.yenialanya.com Orange Alanya]}}</ref>  Inside the castle is the S<U+00FC>leymaniye [[mosque]] and [[caravanserai]], built by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].<ref name=hp/> The old city walls surround much of the eastern peninsula, and can be walked.  Inside the walls are numerous historic [[villa]]s, well preserved examples of the classical period of [[Ottoman architecture]], most built in the early 19th century.

The [[K<U+0131>z<U+0131>l Kule]] (Red Tower) is another well-known building in Alanya.  The {{nowrap|108 foot}} ({{nowrap|33 m}}) high brick building stands at the harbor below the castle, and contains the municipal [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] museum.  Sultan [[Alaeddin Keykubad I]] brought the accomplished architect Ebu Ali from [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] to Alanya to design the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antalya-ws.com/english/location/alanya/history.asp?out=1 |title=K<U+0131>z<U+0131>l Kule (Red Tower) |work=Alanya Cities and Historical Sites |publisher= Turkish Class |date= 2007 |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> The last of Alanya Castle's {{nowrap|83 towers}}, the octagonal structure specifically protected the Tersane ([[arsenal]]), it remains one of the finest examples of medieval military architecture.<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0066-1546%281954%294%3C13%3ASOAWIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7 |title= Summary of Archaeological Work in Turkey in 1953 |author= D<U+00F6>rner, F.

Atat<U+00FC>rk's House and Museum, from his short stay in the city on [[February 18]], [[1935]] is preserved in its historic state and is a good example of the interior of a traditional Ottoman villa, with artifacts from the 1930s.  The house was built between 1880 and 1885 in the "karniyarik" (stuffed eggplant) style.  Bright colors and red roofs are often mandated by neighborhood councils, and give the modern town a pastel glow.

From only {{nowrap|87,080 in}} 1985, the district has surged to hold a population of {{nowrap|384,949}} in 2000.
