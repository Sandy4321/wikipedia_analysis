'''David Starbuck''' (born 6 December 1950) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er who played for [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL).

Starbuck was recruited to Essendon from [[Pascoe Vale Football Club|Pascoe Vale]], a team he played under 19s with. A wingman, Starbuck played in a reserves premiership for Essendon in 1968 and, in the same year, came second in the [[Morrish Medal]] <U+2013> awarded to the [[best and fairest]] player in the VFL under 19s competition <U+2013> to [[Paul Callery]] of [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]].

He made his senior debut in round 6, 1970, and went on to play seven total games that season. Starbuck played six games in 1971 and he kicked the only two goals of his senior VFL career what was to be his last game, a round 22 loss to [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]].

Following Starbuck's departure from Essendon he went to play for [[Coburg Football Club|Coburg]] in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] from 1972 to 1973. Subsequent to that he played for various local clubs, including [[Romsey Football Club|Romsey]] (1974), his original team Pascoe Vale (1975<U+2013>79), [[Reservoir-Lakeside Football Club|Reservoir-Lakeside]] (1980<U+2013>82) and [[Woodend Football Club|Woodend]] (1983<U+2013>84).
