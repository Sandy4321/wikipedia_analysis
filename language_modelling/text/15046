'''''Illinois''''' (styled '''''Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel the Illinoise''''' on the cover; sometimes written as '''''Illinoise''''') is a 2005 [[concept album]] by American [[indie folk]] songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]]. His fifth studio album, ''Illinois'' features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. The album is Stevens' second based on a U.S. state<U+2014>part of a [[The Fifty States Project|planned series of fifty]] that began with the 2003 album ''[[Michigan (album)|Michigan]]'' and that Stevens has since acknowledged was a gag.

Stevens recorded the album using [[Low fidelity|low-fidelity]] methods and a variety of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005 at multiple venues in New York City, where he also produced the album. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state<U+2014>Stevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following a July 4, 2005, release date, Stevens promoted ''Illinois'' with a world tour.

Critics praised the album for its well-written lyrics and complex orchestrations; in particular, reviewers noted Stevens' progress as a songwriter since the release of ''Michigan''. ''Illinois'' was named the best-reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator [[Metacritic]], and was included on several reviewers' "best of the decade" lists<U+2014>including those of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'', [[National Public Radio]], and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. The album amounted to Stevens' greatest public success to date: it was his first to place on the [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'' 200]], and it topped the ''Billboard'' list of "Heatseekers Albums". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by [[Steve Reich]], [[Neil Young]], and [[The Cure]]. Besides numerous references to Illinois history, geography, and attractions, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.

==Background, recording, and tour==

He is wearing a blue t-shirt with an orange letter "I" on it and orange pants.|thumb|right|250px|Sufjan Stevens performing on stage during a tour for ''Illinois''. Stevens and his band the Illinoisemakers wore outfits modeled after those of the cheerleaders of the [[University of Illinois]].]]
Stevens launched his 50-state project in 2003 with the album ''[[Michigan (album)|Michigan]]'' and chose to focus on Illinois with this recording because "it wasn't a great leap", and he liked the state because he considered it the "center of gravity" for the [[American Midwest]].<ref name="dusted" /> Before creating the album, Stevens read literature by Illinois authors [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Carl Sandburg]],<ref name="dusted" /> and studied immigration records<ref name="nme" /> and history books for the state<U+2014>he made the deliberate decision to avoid current events and focused on historical themes.<ref name="quietusinterview" /> He also took trips through several locations in Illinois<ref name="oregon" /> and asked friends and members of Internet [[chat rooms]] for anecdotes about their experiences in the state.<ref name="observer2005" /> Although he began work in 2004<ref name="guardianprofile" /> on [[Oregon]]-themed songs and briefly considered releasing a [[Rhode Island]] [[7"]],<ref name="oregon" /> Stevens has since not released another album focused on a state, saying in a November 2009 interview with [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']] that "the whole premise was such a joke,"<ref name="pastefind" /> and telling Andrew Purcell of ''[[The Guardian]]'' in October 2009 "I have no qualms about admitting [the fifty states project] was a promotional gimmick."<ref name="guard" /> An Arkansas-related song was released through [[NPR]] as "The Lord God Bird"<ref name="lgb" /> and material intended for [[New Jersey]] and [[New York]] became ''[[The BQE (soundtrack)|The BQE]]''.<ref name="nymag" />

All of the songs on ''Illinois'' were written, recorded, [[Audio engineering|engineered]], and [[Record producer|produced]] by Stevens, with most of the material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in [[Astoria, Queens]], and in Stevens' [[Brooklyn]] apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations,<ref name="dusted" /> with additional piano recorded in [[St. Paul's Church (Brooklyn, New York)|St. Paul's Church]] in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in [[Clarksboro, New Jersey]]; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City.<ref name="liner" /> Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: "I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of ''Illinois''. I spent a lot of time alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all."<ref name="pitchinterview" />

Stevens employed low-fidelity recording equipment, which allowed him to retain creative control and keep costs low on recording ''Illinois''. Typically, his process involved recording to 32&nbsp;kHz [[8-track tape]] using inexpensive microphones such as the [[Shure SM57]] and [[C1000 (microphone)|AKG C1000]]. He then employed [[Pro Tools]] for mixing and other production tasks.<ref name="tapeop" />

After consulting with Michael Kaufmann and Lowell Brams of [[Asthmatic Kitty]] about the amount of material he had recorded, Stevens decided against a [[double album]], saying that would be "arrogant".<ref name="pitchinterview" /> In 2006, several tracks recorded during these sessions were sent to Seattle-based musician and producer James McAllister for additional instrumentation and production,<ref name="pitchinterview" /> and were released in 2006 on the follow-up album ''[[The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album]]''. Among these outtakes are three separate recordings of the song "[[Chicago (2005 song)|Chicago]]"<U+2014>including the "Multiple Personality Disorder Version", which was produced during a subsequent tour. The "Adult Contemporary Easy Listening Version" of the song was supposed to appear on the ''Illinois'' album, but was changed at the last minute.<ref name="pitchinterview" />

''Illinois'' was released on July 4, 2005, through [[Rough Trade Records]] in Europe and was distributed domestically by [[Asthmatic Kitty Records]] starting July 5, 2005. Although he initially had no plans to perform this material live,<ref name="pitchinterview" /> less than two weeks after the release of ''Illinois'', Stevens embarked on a North American tour to promote the album,<ref name="bvtour1" /> performing with a string section of eight to ten members<ref name="billboardtour" /> named the Illinoisemakers.<ref name="stereogumtour" /> He deliberately chose to avoid television as a promotional tool and focused on the tour performances themselves.<ref name="observer2005" /> He was supported on some dates by opening acts [[Liz Janes]] (who is also signed to Asthmatic Kitty) and [[Laura Veirs]]<ref name="bvtour2" /> as well as ''Illinois'' collaborator [[Shara Worden]]'s solo project [[My Brightest Diamond]].<ref name="pastetour" /> He toured in support of the album again from September through November 2006, this time including dates in several European cities.<ref name="nmetour" /> During the 2006 dates, Stevens and his band transitioned from wearing [[University of Illinois]]-themed outfits to butterfly suits and bird wings.<ref name="independenttour" />

Reviewers have noted similarities between this album and those of musicians and composers in several [[musical genre]]s<U+2014>from [[Pop music|pop]] to [[contemporary classical music|contemporary classical]], even [[show tunes]] and [[jazz]]-based [[time signature]]s.<ref name="observer2005" /> The lyrics and their rich thematic elements have been noted for their literary quality, earning comparisons to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Walt Whitman]].<ref name="oregon" />

===Musical style===
Reviewers of ''Illinois'' have compared Stevens' style to [[Steve Reich]],<ref name="rs" /> [[Vince Guaraldi]], the [[Danielson Famile]], [[Neil Young]],<ref name="allmusic" /> [[Nick Drake]], and [[Death Cab for Cutie]].<ref name="avclub" /> Stevens' use of large [[orchestra]]l [[arrangement]]s in his music<U+2014>much of it played by himself through the use of [[multi-track recording]]<ref name="pitchfork" /><U+2014>has been noted by several reviewers. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' summarized the musical influences of ''Illinois'', saying "the music draws from high school [[marching band]]s, [[show tunes]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] electronics; we can suspect Steve Reich's ''[[Music for 18 Musicians]]'' is an oft-played record in the Stevens household, since he loves to echo it in his long instrumental passages."<ref name="rs" /> A review in [[The A.V. Club]] referred to some of the vocal work as "regressively [[Twee pop|twee]] communalism", but found Stevens' music overall to be "highly developed".<ref name="avclub" /> The song "Come On! Feel the Illinoise!" uses a [[saxophone]] part from "Close to Me" by [[The Cure]].<ref name="nme" />

The creation of ''Illinois'' marked a shift in Stevens' emphasis on songwriting and studio work toward live performance and more abstract concepts of motion and sound<U+2014>subsequent tours and albums emphasized electronic music and modern dance over the indie folk material on ''Michigan'' and ''Illinois''.<ref name="pitchfork2011" /> He has ceased writing songs about individual characters with straightforward narratives<ref name="observer2011" /> or concept albums<ref name="guardian2009" /> and briefly considered quitting the music business entirely after creating and promoting this album. He also found that the way in which he listened to music had changed after producing ''Illinois'':
{{quote|I think now I listen more as a technician and a researcher. I'm always hearing music in terms of what I can take out of it, and I think I've always listened like that. I have a hard time just listening for pleasure. I'm much less about instinct, and more of a utilitarian listener. Like, what is the use of this song? What is the usefulness of this melody for this theme or statement? What are they doing that's unusual sounding, and how can I learn from that?|Sufjan Stevens, 2006<ref name="pitchinterview" />}}
Stevens is a classically trained [[Oboe|oboist]]<ref name="dusted" /> and his knowledge of [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[baroque music]] influenced many of his arrangements. Stevens himself has noted the influence of composers [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and [[Edvard Grieg]]; along with [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary composers]] [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]].<ref name="dusted" /> The music on this album was written to be grandiose, to match the history of the territory.<ref name="oregon" /> Stevens used [[time signature]] changes in the composition of ''Illinois'' for dynamic effect<U+2014>for instance, "Come On! Feel the Illinoise!" begins with a 5/4 time signature and then changes <ref name="popmatters" /> to a standard 4/4 later in the song.<ref name="slanted" />

===Illinois themes===
[[File:Kazimierz Pu<U+0142>aski pod Cz<U+0119>stochow<U+0105>.PNG|alt=A painting of Casimir Pulaski leading a cavalry and brandishing a sword.|thumb|Casimir Pulaski is memorialized in Illinois by the name of [[Pulaski County, Illinois|Pulaski County]] as well as the state holiday [[Casimir Pulaski Day]].]]
Many of the lyrics in ''Illinois'' make references to persons, places, and events related to the state of the same name. "Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois" is about [[Black Triangle (UFO)#Illinois police sighting incident|a UFO sighting]] by police officers near [[Highland, Illinois]], where several persons reported seeing a large triangular object with three lights flying at night. "Come on! Feel the Illinoise!" makes reference to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], which took place in Chicago in 1893.<ref name="chicagoreader" />

"John Wayne Gacy, Jr." documents the story of the 1970s Chicago-based [[John Wayne Gacy|serial killer of the same name]]. Several lyrics make explicit references to events in his life: "[w]hen the swingset hit his head" refers to event in Gacy's childhood, when a swing hit his head and caused a blood clot in his brain;<ref name="liner" /><ref name="pitchfork" /> "He dressed up like a clown for them / with his face paint white and red" alludes to the nickname given to Gacy<U+2014>the "Killer Clown";<ref name="nme" /> and "He put a cloth on their lips / Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth" references Gacy's use of [[chloroform]] to subdue and molest his victims.<ref name="liner" /><ref name="pitchfork" /> The song ends with the narrator turning inward with the lyrics: "And in my best behavior, I am really just like him / Look beneath the floorboards for the secrets I have hid." Stevens stated in a 2009 interview with [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']] that "we're all capable of what [Gacy] did."<ref name="pastefind" />

"Casimir Pulaski Day" interweaves a personal story with the state holiday [[Casimir Pulaski Day]].<ref name="chicagoreader" /> "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts" makes references to [[Superman]], whose fictional hometown of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] was partially modeled after Chicago (the town of [[Metropolis, Illinois]] has also capitalized on this association). Jessica Hooper of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' noted that [[Ray Middleton]]<U+2014>who was the first actor to play the comic book superhero<U+2014>was also born in Chicago.<ref name="chicagoreader" /> "They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!" makes references to ghost towns of Illinois.<ref name="dusted" /> Stevens relates experiences from a summer camp he went to as a child in [[Michigan]] for "The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!", but moved the locale to Illinois for the sake of the album.<ref name="tikkun" /> The track "Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!" includes references to [[Decatur, Illinois]], but Stevens stated the track also acted as "an exercise in rhyme schemes".<ref name="av2" /> Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="av2" />

Other allusions to the state's people, places, and events include the [[Black Hawk War]], author [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Stephen A. Douglas]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], the [[Sangamon River]], the [[Chicago Cubs]], the Sears Tower dubbed "Seer's Tower" (now called [[Willis Tower]]), and the localities of [[Jacksonville, Illinois|Jacksonville]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Metropolis, Illinois|Metropolis]], [[Savanna, Illinois|Savanna]] [[Caledonia, Illinois|Caledonia]], [[Secor, Illinois|Secor]], [[Magnolia, Illinois|Magnolia]], [[Kankakee, Illinois|Kankakee]], [[Evansville, Illinois|Evansville]], and the several locations named [[Centerville, Illinois (disambiguation)|Centerville, Illinois]].<ref name="liner" /> During the tour following the release of ''Illinois'', Stevens' band wore cheerleader outfits based on those of the [[University of Illinois]].<ref name="av2" />

===Christianity===

|format = [[Ogg]] [[Vorbis]]}}
Although ''Illinois'' is a concept album about the U.S. state, Stevens also explored themes related to [[Christianity]] and the [[Bible]]. As a Christian, he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career<U+2014>particularly on the 2004 album ''[[Seven Swans]]''<U+2014>and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements.<ref name="observer2005" /> The song "Decatur, or, Round of Applause for Your Stepmother!" includes the line "It's the great [[YHWH|I Am]]"<ref name="liner" /><U+2014>taken from the [[I Am that I Am|response]] God gave when [[Moses]] asked for his name in the [[Book of Exodus]] ({{Bibleref|Exodus|3:14}}).<ref name="ct" /> "Casimir Pulaski Day" describes the death of a girlfriend due to [[bone cancer]], and the narrator questions God in the process.<ref name="ct" /> More abstract allusions appear in "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts", which utilizes Superman as a [[Christ figure]] and "The Seer's Tower", which references the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Second Coming of Christ]].<ref name="ct" /> Songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus<U+2014>such as "John Wayne Gacy, Jr."<U+2014>also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption.<ref name="independenttour" />

==Artwork==

Divya Srinivasan created the album artwork,<ref name="liner" /> depicting a variety of Illinois-related themes, including [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], the [[Willis Tower|Sears Tower]], and [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]. The album cover reads, "Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come On Feel the Illinoise!" as a wordplay on the common mispronunciation of the state's name as "ill-i-NOYZ" and a reference to the [[Slade]] song "[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]" made famous by the metal band [[Quiet Riot]]. The text on the cover caused some confusion over the actual title of the album<U+2014>it is officially titled ''Illinois'', as opposed to ''Come on Feel the Illinoise'' or ''Illinoise''. ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' listed ''Illinois'' as having the seventh best album art of the decade 2000<U+2013>2009.<ref name="pasteart" /> The album also won the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards|PLUG Independent Music Award]] for Album Art/Packaging of the Year in 2006.<ref name="plug" />

Shortly after the release of the album, reports arose that [[DC Comics]] had issued a [[cease and desist letter]] to Asthmatic Kitty because of the depiction of [[Superman]] on the cover.<ref name="pweekly" /><ref name="chicagoist" /> However, on October 4, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty announced that there had been no cease and desist letter; the record company's own lawyers had warned about the copyright infringement. On June 30, 2005, Asthmatic Kitty's distributor [[Secretly Canadian]] asked its retailers not to sell the album; however, it was not recalled. On July 5, the distributor told its retailers to go ahead and sell their copies,<ref name="billboard2" /> as DC Comics agreed to allow Asthmatic Kitty to sell the copies of the album that were already manufactured, but the image was removed from subsequent pressings.<ref name="ak" /> Soon after it was made public that the cover would be changed, copies of the album featuring Superman were sold for as high as $75 on [[eBay]].<ref name="billboard2" /> On the vinyl edition released on November 22, 2005, Superman's image is covered by a balloon sticker.<ref name="discogs" /> The image of the balloon sticker was also used on the cover of the Compact Disc and later printings of the double vinyl release.<ref name="ak2" /> Stevens himself was surprised by the development and also had to pay a fee for referencing lyrics from [[Woody Guthrie]]'s folk anthem "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" in the track "No Man's Land", which was later released on ''The Avalanche''.<ref name="pitchinterview" />

==Reception==
''Illinois'' was Sufjan Stevens' greatest commercial and critical success to date. For the first time, his work charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received several awards from critics.

===Sales figures and chart performance===
In its first week of sales, ''Illinois'' sold 9,000 copies, 20% coming from online sales.<ref name="billboard3" /> Overall, the album sold more than 100,000 copies by November 2005<ref name="observer2005" /> and over 300,000 by the end of 2009.<ref name="pastefind" /> It was the first Sufjan Stevens release to place on the ''Billboard'' 200, reaching No. 121 within eight weeks on the chart.<ref name="billboard" /> It also placed number one on ''Billboard''{{'}}s "Heatseekers Albums" list and number four on the "Independent Albums" list, remaining on them for 32 and 39 weeks respectively.<ref name="billboard" />

Critical reception of ''Illinois'' was overwhelmingly positive. Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] compiled 40 critic reviews of ''Illinois'', and gave the album a 90/100 ("Universal Acclaim"),<ref name="metacritic" /> designating it the best-reviewed album of 2005.<ref name="mcbest" /> Andy Battaglia of [[The A.V. Club]] said that Stevens "has grown into one of the best song-makers in indie rock" with the album.<ref name="avclub" /> Tim Jonze of ''[[NME]]'' called ''Illinois'' "a brainy little fucker" and described Stevens as "prolific, intelligent and<U+2014>most importantly<U+2014>brimming with heart-wrenching melodies."<ref name="nme" /> Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' responded favorably to the album, praising the "over-the-top arrangements" and Stevens' "breathy, gentle voice". Sheffield criticized "John Wayne Gacy, Jr.", stating that it "symbolizes nothing about American life except the existence of creative-writing workshops", but elsewhere praised the personal nature of songs such as "Chicago" and "Casimir Pulaski Day".<ref name="rs" /> Michael Metivier of [[PopMatters]] described "John Wayne Gacy, Jr." as "horrifying, tragic, and deeply sad without proselytizing."<ref name="popmatters" /> Amanda Petrusich of [[Pitchfork Media]] described ''Illinois'' as "strange and lush, as excessive and challenging as its giant, gushing song titles."<ref name="pitchfork" /> Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'' echoed this sentiment by saying that the music sounds like "[[The Polyphonic Spree]] produced by [[Brian Eno]]."<ref name="guardianreview" />

Jesse Jarnow of ''Paste'' praised the playful nature of ''Illinois'', commenting that it had "sing-song" melodies and "jaunty" orchestrations. Jarnow also noted ironic lyrics, citing a line from "The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades is Out to Get Us!": "I can't explain the state I'm in..." after a section of the song that references many Illinois landmarks.<ref name="paste" /> [[Q (magazine)|''Q'']] called ''Illinois'' a "sizeable step forward" from ''Michigan'', and said Stevens' love for the state of Illinois is infectious.<ref name="q" /> Catherine Lewis of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' responded favorably to the album, stating that it has well-written lyrics, comparing Stevens' rhyming to that of [[Stephin Merritt]]. Lewis cited "Casimir Pulaski Day" as one of the most memorable songs of the album.<ref name="post" />

===Accolades===
''Illinois'' achieved lasting fame with inclusion on numerous reviewers' "best of the year" and "best of the decade" lists. In particular, the album topped the best of the decade list appearing in the November 2009 issue of ''Paste'' <ref name="paste2" /> and [[National Public Radio]] named ''Illinois'' on their list of "The Decade's 50 Most Important Recordings".<ref name="npr" /> Pitchfork Media called ''Illinois'' the sixteenth best album of the decade,<ref name="pitchforklist" /> with Stevens' previous album<U+2014>''Michigan''<U+2014>placing 70 on that same list.<ref name="pitchforklist2" /> The album also won the 2005 New Pantheon Award<U+2014>a type of [[Shortlist Music Prize]].<ref name="shortlist" /> Finally, ''Paste'' listed Stevens as one of their "100 Best Living Songwriters" in 2006, primarily due to the writing on ''Michigan'' and ''Illinois''.<ref name="pasteliving" />
