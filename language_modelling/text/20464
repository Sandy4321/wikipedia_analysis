'''Port Saeed''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+064A><U+0646><U+0627><U+0621> <U+0633><U+0639><U+064A><U+062F>}}) is a locality in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).  Port Saeed is one of the smaller ports in the city of Dubai and is not comparable in size or traffic to either [[Port Rashid]] or [[Jebel Ali Port]].  Port Saeed provides docking and logistical facilities for boats and small ships in the [[Dubai Creek]].

Port Saeed also has a small residential neighbourhood that is currently being redesigned by [[Dubai Municipality]].<ref name=residential>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19850506_ITM Dubai Municipality re-designs Port Saeed area]. AMEInfo.com. December 28, 2003</ref> As a result, several new buildings and real estate property development projects are being planned for the area.  

Port Saeed is bordered in the north and west by [[Al Rigga]] and in the east by [[Al Garhoud]]. Important landmarks in Port Saeed include [[Deira City Centre]], [[Dubai Shopping Centre]] and [[Welcare Hospital]].
