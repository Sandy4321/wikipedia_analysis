'''Roland Henry Chaplin''', [[Order_of_the_British_Empire|OBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society|FRAeS]], (1899&ndash;1988) was known as <U+2018>Roy<U+2019>. He worked with Sir [[Sydney Camm]] at [[Hawker Aircraft]] from 1927 to 1962. In 1927 the company was producing biplanes for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). During the [[World War II|Second World War]] over 14,000 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s were built. In 1962 the [[Hawker P.1127]], a vertical and/or short take-off and landing aircraft ([[V/STOL]]), was being flight tested and would later be developed into the [[BAe Harrier]], the world<U+2019>s first operational V/STOL aircraft. So Chaplin went from biplanes to the jump-jets.

== Early Career ==
Chaplin was educated at [[Tiffin School|Tiffin Boys School]]. He attended [[London University]] between 1915&ndash;1917 reading engineering. The [[World War I|First World War]] interrupted his studies when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] serving in France and Belgium until 1919. Chaplin was then obliged to repeat his second year at London University, finally graduating with a second class<!--do we need to state the class here?--> honours degree in engineering ([[Bachelor_of_Science|BSc]]) in 1921.<ref name="Times1988">{{cite news |title=Roy Chaplin; Obituary |first= |last= |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA117348047&v=2.1&u=cam_earl&it=r&p=SPJ.SP01&sw=w |newspaper=Times|location=London, England |date=20&nbsp;December 1988|accessdate=31&nbsp;January 2013}} {{subscription required}}</ref> In 1922 Chaplin got his first job at [[William Foster & Co.|Gwynnes of Hammersmith]] who manufactured pumps.<ref name="Guardian1988">{{cite news|last=Barfield|first=Norman|title=Obituary of Roy Chaplin: Shaper of our planes|accessdate=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 December 1988}}</ref>

== Hawkers ==
[[File:HawkerFury43sqn.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin worked on the [[Hawker Fury]]]]
=== Biplanes ===
In 1926 Chaplin joined [[Hawker Aircraft|Hawkers]] at [[Kingston upon Thames (parish)|Kingston]],<ref name="Times1988" /> when its entire design staff numbered less than forty people. By the time he left thirty-seven years later, the design team had expanded to around five-hundred. In the 1920s and 1930s Hawkers produced many biplanes. The most successful was the [[Hawker Hart]]. A contemporary design on which Chaplin worked was the [[Hawker Fury]]. At times in the 1930s, over eighty&nbsp;percent of the aircraft of the RAF were Hawker biplanes. [[Robert Lickley|Lickley]] and others give details of these early aircraft, the modern Hawker monoplanes and the jets.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fozard|first=John|title=Sydney Camm and the Hurricane|year=1991|publisher=Airlife|location=Shrewsbury|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pJTfAAAAMAAJ|pages=44-57|isbn=9781560980346}}</ref>

=== Monoplanes ===
Monoplanes had been built in the early years of aviation, but biplanes found greater favour during the First World War. By 1933 it was believed that the monoplane was unsuitable, unsafe and even dangerous for use as a military aeroplane, as Chaplin himself said.<ref name="Hurricane">{{Citation | title = Proceedings of the Hurricane 50th Anniversary Symposium| editor-last = Fozard | editor-first = John W | date = 6&nbsp;November 1985 | place = Brooklands | publisher = [[Royal Aeronautical Society]].

Hawkers developed the idea of a monoplane version of the Fury biplane fighter with other refinements such as an enclosed cockpit. In 1934 the 'Hawker Fury Monoplane' became the [[Hawker Hurricane|<U+2018>Hurricane<U+2019>]] and the prototype first flew from [[Brooklands]] on 6&nbsp;November 1935. At this time, no contract had yet been placed to build the Hurricane in quantity.<ref name="Flight1940">{{cite journal | date = 31&nbsp;October 1940| title = The Hawker Hurricane| journal = [[Flight_(magazine)|Flight]] | page = h| url =http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1940/1940%20-%203082.html| accessdate = 31&nbsp;January 2013 | quote=... it would be impossible to mention all. However, we feel that at the very least the names of Messrs. R. H. Chaplin, S. D. Davies, R. Mclntyre, and R. Lickley should be brought into this account of the birth and growth of the Hurricane.}}</ref>
 
[[File:Hawker_Hurricane_before_maiden_flight_1935.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin's share in the design of the [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] was rewarded in 1946 with an&nbsp;[[OBE]]]]

By March 1936, test flying of the prototype was proceeding satisfactorily. The Hawker Board issued instructions planning, jigging and tooling for the production of one-thousand aircraft. The official contract followed three months later. Chaplin wrote "[I]t is solely due to the foresight and courage of the Hawker Directors in taking this advance action that something like an extra 500 aircraft had been delivered by August 1940 than would have been the case if we waited for a production contract".<ref name="Hurricane" /> Chaplin also said that he "... was particularly proud of the fact that the Hurricane brought down more enemy aircraft in the Battle of Britain than all the Spitfires, Blenheims, Defiants, and ground defences put together".<ref name="Times1988" />

In 1939 that Chaplin was formally promoted to Assistant Chief Designer. In 1940 Chaplin and most of the Hawker Design Office moved down the Portsmouth Road from Kingston to [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]], an 18th-century mansion at Esher. From 1937 and on until after the Second World War, Chaplin was involved with the design of the [[Hawker Typhoon|Typhoon]], [[Hawker Tempest|Tempest]] and [[Hawker Sea Fury|Sea Fury]] aircraft. In 1946 Chaplin<U+2019>s share in the design and development of the Hurricane was acknowledged when he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37412 |date= 9&nbsp;January 1946|startpage=277|supp=yes }}</ref><ref name="RAeS awards">{{cite book|last=Royal Aeronautical Society|title=Wilbur and Orville Wright Medals and Awards Brochure|year=1960|location=London}}</ref>

[[File:Hawker_P._1127_-_NASA.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin was proud of his work on the [[Harrier Jump Jet]] (P.1127)]]

=== Jets ===
Less than twenty years after Chaplin joined Hawkers, the company moved into the jet era when work was started on the [[Hawker Sea Hawk|P.1040]] in 1944. An account of Hawker jet aircraft is documented elsewhere.<ref name="Mason1991">{{cite book|last=Mason|first=Francis K|title=Hawker Aircraft since 1920|year=1991|publisher=Putnam|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ooJH-hcMJA0C|isbn=9781557503510}}</ref> 

The success of the [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter]], of which nearly two-thousand were built, seemed to be the foundation of a secure future for Hawkers. The [[1957 Defence White Paper]] contained the devastating pronouncement that the defence of the country would in the future be achieved with guided weapons rather than piloted fighters. Hawkers were then proceeding with a private venture design of a [[Mach_number|Mach 2+]] fighter designated [[Hawker P.1121|P.1121]]. The White Paper was the death knell of that project. The cancellation of the P.1121 led to increased emphasis on another project which soon became the [[Hawker P.1127|P.1127]].<ref name="Guardian1988" />

In 1957, Chaplin became Chief Designer<ref name="Times1988" /> and in 1959 an Executive Director on the Hawker Board.<ref name="RAeS awards" /><ref name="Flight1959">{{cite journal | date = 24&nbsp;April 1959| title = Hawker Board Strengthened| journal = [[Flight_(magazine)|Flight]] | page = 562| url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1959/1959%20-%201167.html| accessdate = 31&nbsp;January 2013}}</ref> That year an order for two prototypes of the P.1127 was placed, with first flights of this revolutionary machine in 1960.

== Retirement == 
Hawkers had full UK government support for the supersonic V/STOL [[Hawker P.1154|P.1154]] while its competitor, the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], was building the [[BAC TSR2|TSR2]]. In 1965, Harold Wilson<U+2019>s government realized that the country could afford neither of these aircraft, and abruptly cancelled them. 

The 1982 [[Falklands War|Falklands Conflict]] might not have been won by Britain but for the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Harrier]], in the opinion of [[Admiral_of_the_Fleet_(Royal_Navy)|Admiral of the fleet]] [[Terence Lewin, Baron Lewin]].<ref name="Godden1983">{{cite book|last=Godden|first=John|title=Harrier - Ski Jump to Victory|year=1983|publisher=Brassey|location=Oxford|pages=v|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2nENAAACAAJ}}</ref> The BBC interviewed Chaplin in his quiet Wiltshire home. It was late public acclamation for his work.
 
1985 was the fiftieth anniversary of the first flight of the Hurricane. The Royal Aeronautical Society organized a Hurricane Golden Jubilee symposium. The venue was at Brooklands, Weybridge where the first flight of the Hurricane had taken place in 1935. Eighty-seven year-old Chaplin was the oldest of four speakers who had worked on the design of the aircraft.<ref name="Hurricane" /> 

Chaplin died on 13&nbsp;December 1988 in his ninetieth-year.<ref name="Times1988" />
