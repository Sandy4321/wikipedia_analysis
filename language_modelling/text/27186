'''''Village of Idiots''''' is a short [[animated]] [[comedy]] based on the classic [[Jewish]], humorous, [[folk tales]] of [[Jewish humour#Chelm|Helm]] made by animators/directors [[Eugene Fedorenko]] and [[Rose Newlove]] with the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB).

==Summary==
<U+201C>Outsiders call Helm the village of idiots,<U+201D> Shmendrick explains, <U+201C>but our rabbi said we were a city of natural geniuses, with our own way of figuring things out.<U+201D>

With muted, mesmerizing illustrations and heavy accordion-based music, the film follows Shmendrick as he sets out on a journey away from home for the first time. But along his journey from Helm to [[Warsaw]], he comes upon a city that is eerily similar to the one he left behind. The rest of us might think Shmendrik just took a wrong turn and ended up back home, but for Shmendrik, this discovery sheds light on holy teachings: <U+201C>The [[Talmud]] tells us that the world everywhere is the same,<U+201D> he recalls.
