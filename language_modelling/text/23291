=== Critical response ===
In reviewing ''House of Music'', Irv Cohn of ''[[Stereo Review]]'' called "Bon Bon Vie" an "interesting" song and stated, "real musicians are at work in dance music in the post-disco era."<ref name="Cohn"/> The ''Black Music & Jazz Review'' commented that they were not "overly impressed by the album, they enjoyed the single and its B-side "a lot", as well as T.S. Monk's subsequent single "Candidate for Love".<ref>{{cite journal|title=TS MONK: Candidate For Love/The Last Of The Wicked Romancers (Mirage K11648)|journal=Black Music & Jazz Review|year=1981|volume=4|page=43}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Sandy Linzer "has found for T.S. Monk a flexible, melodic style that is halfway between [[Chic (band)|chic]]'s disco and [[Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band|Dr. Buzzard]]'s [[swing music|swing]]."<ref name="Holden"/> 

Although he found Monk's album "spotty", [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' praised "Bon Bon Vie" as "a rich song about aspiring to the rich life" and wrote in a 1981 review, "I love not only the subtle Sandy Linzer lyric but also Thelonious Monk Jr.'s rough, high-humored vocal and incisive drumming, and its arrangement keeps giving up new pleasures."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv4-81.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=March 30, 1981|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> He also noted its musical aesthetic, calling it "ebullient on top and this far from desperation underneath".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=1980|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=8534|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=The Village Voice|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}</ref> Christgau later named it the second-best song of the 1980s in a list for ''The Village Voice''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/list/decade80.php|title=Decade Personal Best: '80s|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=January 2, 1990|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref>
