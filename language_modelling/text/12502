The '''Bennelong Society''' is as a conservative [[think-tank]] dedicated to [[Indigenous Australian]] affairs.

The society was established to:

* promote debate and analysis of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] policy in [[Australia]], both contemporary and historical; 
* inquire into the causes of the present appalling plight of many contemporary Aboriginal people; 
* seek to influence public opinion so that the prospects for amelioration of the condition of these people are improved; 
* encourage research into the history of the interaction between Australia's Indigenous people and the Europeans and others who settled in Australia from [[1788 in Australia|1788]] onwards, and of the ideas through which this interaction was interpreted by both Europeans and Aborigines; 
* make available to the Australian community, particularly through the Internet, the results of these activities. 

The [http://www.bennelong.com.au Bennelong Society's Website] was officially launched by Senator the Hon. [[John Herron (Australian politician)|John Herron]] with a speech at Parliament House, Canberra on [[15 May]] [[2001 in Australia|2001]].
