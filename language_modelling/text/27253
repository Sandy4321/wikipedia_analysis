The '''snoring rail''' (''Aramidopsis plateni'') also known as the '''Celebes rail''' or '''Platen's rail''' is a large flightless [[Rallidae|rail]], the only member of the [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus '''''Aramidopsis'''''. It is an Indonesian [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] found in dense vegetation in wet areas of [[Sulawesi]] and nearby [[Buton]]. The rail has grey underparts, a white chin, brown wings and a rufous patch on the hindneck. The sexes are similar, but the female has a brighter neck patch and a differently coloured bill and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The typical call is the snoring ''ee-orrrr'' sound that gives the bird its English name.

Its inaccessible habitat and retiring nature mean that the snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and [[predation]] by [[introduced species]]; it is therefore evaluated as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] on the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

==Taxonomy==
The [[Rallidae|rails]] are a large and very widespread family, with nearly 150 species. They are small to medium-sized, terrestrial or wetland birds, and their short bodies are often flattened laterally to help them move through dense vegetation. Island species readily become flightless; of 53 extant or recently extinct [[taxon|taxa]] restricted to islands, 32 have lost the ability to fly.<ref name = hbwonlinefam>{{cite web| author = Hoyo, Josep del; Elliott, Andrew; Sargatal, Jordi; Christie, David A; de Juana, Eduardo (eds.)|year=2013| title = Rails, Gallinules and Coots | work= Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | url=http://www.hbw.com/family/rails-gallinules-and-coots-rallidae | publisher= Lynx Edicions | location =Barcelona|accessdate = 13 April 2014}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

The snoring rail was first classified as ''Rallus plateni'' by German ornithologist [[August Wilhelm Heinrich Blasius]] in 1860,<ref name = hbwonlinefam/> but was moved to its current [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus ''Aramidopsis'' by English zoologist [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] in 1893.<ref name= sharpe>{{cite journal |last1=Sharpe |first1= Richard Bowdler |year=1893 |title= ''Aramidopsis'', gen. nov.| journal= Bulletin of the British Ornithologists | volume= 1| page=54 | url =http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32475196 |doi= | jstor= |issue=}}</ref> Following Taylor (1998), it was considered to be more similar to the [[Inaccessible Island rail|Inaccessible Island]] and [[white-throated rail]]s than to members of the ''[[Rallus]]'' [[genus]],<ref name=hbwonline>{{cite web| author =Hoyo, Josep del; Elliott, Andrew; Sargatal, Jordi; Christie, David A; de Juana, Eduardo (eds.)|year=2013| title= Snoring Rail (''Aramidopsis plateni'') | work= Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive | url=http://www.hbw.com/species/snoring-rail-aramidopsis-platen| location =Barcelona | publisher= Lynx Edicions | accessdate = 28 May 2014}} {{subscription required}}</ref> but a 2012 [[mitochondria]]l [[gene]] study suggests that it should actually be placed in ''[[Gallirallus]]'', with [[Lewin's rail]] and the [[slaty-breasted rail]] as its closest relatives.<ref name= kirchman>{{cite journal |last1= Kirchman |first1= Jeremy J  |year= 2012|title= Speciation of flightless rails on islands: a DNA-based phylogeny of the typical rails of the Pacific | journal= The Auk | volume=129 | pages= 56<U+2013>59 | url = |doi=10.1525/auk.2011.11096|jstor= |issue=1}}</ref>

'' Aramidopsis '' derives from the genus name of the [[limpkin]], ''Aramus'' and the Greek suffix ''opsis'', "resembling". Although the rail shares the origin of its name with the South American ''[[Aramides]]'' species,<ref name=job52>Jobling (2010) p. 52.</ref> its distinctive bill, thick legs and barred lower belly distinguish it from that group.<ref name= olson>{{cite journal|journal=Wilson Journal|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v085n04/p0381-p0416.pdf|volume=85|issue=4|pages=381<U+2013>416 | last1=Olson |first1= Storrs L |year=1973 | title=A classification of the Rallidae | jstor=4160386}}</ref> The species name '' plateni'' commemorates [[Carl Constantin Platen]], a German doctor who collected birds and butterflies in the [[Malay Archipelago]]<ref name=job309>Jobling (2010) p. 309.</ref> and gave Blasius his specimen of the rail.<ref name=meyer> Meyer & Wiglesworth (1898) vol. 1, pp. 7<U+2013>8. </ref> The common name refers to the rail's distinctive call, and was given to the bird as ''der Vogel Schnarch'' (the snoring bird) by German [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Gerd Heinrich]] when he rediscovered the species in 1932.<ref name= heinb> Heinrich (2007) pp. 103<U+2013>105. </ref>

==Description==
The snoring rail is {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weighs {{convert|143|<U+2013>|160|g|oz|abbr=on}}. It is flightless, with short wings, a very short tail and strong legs and feet. The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey, apart from a white chin, and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange-red. Most of the rest of the upperparts are brown, and the belly, flanks and undertail have white barring. The male has black legs, a yellow [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and a brown and greenish down-curved bill. The female is similar, but has a brighter hindneck colour, less white on the chin, a red iris, a cream and reddish bill and blue-grey legs. Immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed. Visual confusion with [[Sympatry|sympatric]] rails is unlikely. The [[blue-faced rail]] is similar in size, but is chestnut above and black below, and the [[buff-banded rail]] has strongly marked upperparts, breast and head. The slaty-breasted rail is smaller and has barred upperparts.<ref name=taylor/>

The call, given frequently, is a short ''wheez'' followed by a distinctive snoring ''ee-orrrr''. A deep ''hmmmm'' sound has also been recorded.<ref name=taylor/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The snoring rail is an uncommon Indonesian [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] species of lowland and hill forests in northern, north central and southeastern [[Sulawesi]].<ref name=taylor/> Another population was found on [[Buton]] island in 1995.<ref name=birdbase>{{cite web|title=Snoring Rail ''Aramidopsis plateni'' |url= http://birdbase.hokkaido-ies.go.jp/rdb/rdb_en/aramplat.pdf |work= Birdbase | publisher = Hokkaido Institute of Environmental Sciences |accessdate=30 May 2014}}</ref>

The typical habitat of this species is dense vegetation in wet areas. This may include impenetrable [[bamboo]] and [[liana]] in forests, [[rattan]] in regrown forests, or [[Miscanthus sinensis|elephant grass]] and bushes on the hillsides of the [[Minahassa Peninsula]]. Claims of the species occurring in rice fields are believed to be due to confusion with the buff-banded rail.<ref name=hbwonline/> The snoring rail occurs from sea level to {{convert|1300|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=taylor/>

==Behaviour==
Its inaccessible habitat and sparse distribution means that little is known about this species. A few birds were shot by Platen and another expedition led by [[Paul Sarasin]] and his second cousin, [[Fritz Sarasin|Fritz]], between 1893 and 1898,<ref name=meyer2> Meyer & Wiglesworth (1898) vol. 2, pp. 690<U+2013>692. </ref> but the rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until Heinrich found it almost at the end of a two-year survey of Sulawesi, then known as Celebes. He described it as "the most priceless catch that I have ever hunted or will hunt".<ref name= collar>{{cite journal |last1= Collar |first1=Nigel J|year=2009 |title= Pioneer of Asian ornithology: Gerd Heinrich | journal= BirdingASIA | volume=11 | pages=33<U+2013>40 | url =http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/cns26/njc/Papers/Gerd%20Heinrich%20pioneer%20of%20Asian%20ornithology.pdf }}</ref> More than a decade later, Dutch ornithologist Louis Coomans de Ruiter also took a year to find the rail, despite concentrating on known suitable habitat.<ref name=birdbase/> There were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989.<ref name= Watling>{{cite journal |last1= Watling|first1=Dick |year=1983 |title= Ornithological notes from Sulawesi | journal= Emu | volume= 83 | pages= 247<U+2013>261 | url = |doi=|jstor= |issue=}}</ref><ref name= lambert>{{cite journal |last1= Lambert |first1= Frank |year= 1989|title= Some observations of the endemic rails | journal= Kukila | volume= 4| pages=34<U+2013>36 | url = http://kukila.org/index.php/KKL/article/view/47 |doi=|jstor= |issue=1}} (registration required)</ref> Sight records remain infrequent,<ref name=birdbase/> and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied.<ref name = IUCN/>

The snoring rail catches crabs in highland streams, and these crustaceans may be a major dietary item. It also forages in muddy areas, and has been recorded as consuming lizards.<ref name=taylor>Taylor & van Perlo (1998) pp. 329<U+2013>331.</ref> Nothing is known of its breeding behaviour other than a report of an adult seen feeding with two chicks in August 1983,<ref name=hbwonline/> but the original report gives no details of the claimed sighting.<ref name= kukila>{{cite journal |last1= Andrew |first1= Paul |last2= Holmes |first2=Derek A|year=1990 |title= Sulawesi Bird Report | journal= Kukila | volume=5 | pages=4<U+2013>26 | url = http://kukila.org/index.php/KKL/article/view/78/77 |doi=|jstor= |issue=1}} (registration required)</ref>

==Status==
The snoring rail is restricted to Sulawesi and Buton, and has an estimated population of 3,500<U+2013>15,000 individuals. Its numbers are thought to be decreasing, and its restricted range and small population mean that the species is classified as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).<ref name=IUCN/>

It may always have been thinly spread, but there has been widespread deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large [[Lore Lindu National Park|Lore Lindu]] and [[Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park]]s are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name= roots> Roots (2006) pp. 56<U+2013>57. </ref> A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.<ref name= lee>{{cite journal |last1= Lee |first1= Tien Ming |last2= Sodhi |first2= Navjot S |last3=Prawiradilaga |first3= Dewi M |year=2007 |title= The importance of Protected Areas for the forest and endemic avifauna of Sulawesi (Indonesia) | journal= Ecological Applications | volume=17 | pages=1727<U+2013>1741 | url = |doi=|jstor=40062070 |issue=6}}</ref>
