'''William I Montagu''', alias '''de Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury, 3rd Baron Montacute, King of Mann''' (1301 - 30 January 1344) was an [[English people|English]] nobleman and loyal servant of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].

The son of [[William de Montacute, 2nd Baron Montacute|William de Montacute]], the second [[Baron Montacute]], he entered the royal household at an early age, and became a close companion of the young Prince Edward. The relationship continued after Edward was crowned king following the deposition of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] in 1327. In 1330, Montagu was one of Edward's main accomplices in the coup against [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who up until then had been acting as the king's protector.

In the following years Montagu served the king in various capacities, primarily in the [[Second War of Scottish Independence|Scottish Wars]]. He was richly rewarded, and among other things received the lordship of the [[Isle of Man]]. In 1337, he was created Earl of Salisbury, and given an annual income of 1000 [[Mark (money)|marks]] to go with the title. He served on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] in the early years of the [[Hundred Years' War (1337<U+2013>1360)|Hundred Years' War]], but in 1340 he was captured by the French, and in return for his freedom had to promise never to fight in France again. Salisbury died of wounds suffered at a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] early in 1344.

Legend has it that Montagu's wife [[Catherine Montacute, Countess of Salisbury|Catherine]] was raped by Edward III, but this story is almost certainly French propaganda. William and Catherine had six children, most of whom married into the nobility. Modern historians have called William Montague Edward's "most intimate personal friend"<ref name="McK 152">{{cite book|first=May|last=McKisack|authorlink=May McKisack|title=The Fourteenth Century: 1307-1399|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1959|page=152|isbn=0-19-821712-9}}</ref> and "the chief influence behind the throne from Mortimer's downfall in 1330 until his own death in 1344."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Reign of Edward III|first= W.M.|last=Ormrod|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|year=1990|page=24|isbn=0-300-04876-9}}</ref>

==Family background==
William was born in [[Cassington]] in [[Oxfordshire]] in 1301. His was the eldest son of [[William de Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu|William de Montagu]], the second [[Baron Montagu]], and Elizabeth Montfort, daughter of Peter de Montfort of [[Beaudesert, Warwickshire|Beaudesert]], [[Warwickshire]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Ormrod|first=W.

==Early service==
The younger William was still a minor at the time of his father's death, and entered the royal household as a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the king in 1320.<ref name="PE223">{{cite book|first=M.C.|last=Prestwich|authorlink=Michael Prestwich|title=Plantagenet England: 1225-1360|edition=|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2005|page=223|isbn=0-19-822844-9}}</ref> On 21 February 1323 he was granted his father's lands and title.<ref name="DNB"/> His service to [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] took him abroad to the Continent in both 1320 and 1325.<ref name="DNB"/> In 1326 he was knighted.<ref name="WW?"/> After the deposition of Edward II in 1327, Montagu continued in the service of Edward's son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. He helped the new king in repelling the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] invasion of 1327, and was created [[knight banneret]] in 1328.<ref name="DNB"/>

Montagu enjoyed a close relationship with Edward III, and accompanied him abroad on a diplomatic mission in 1329. That same year he was sent on an embassy to negotiate a marriage alliance with King [[Philip VI of France]].<ref name="DNB"/> His most important task, however, came in connection with a mission to the Papacy in [[Avignon]]. The young king<U+2014>along with his government<U+2014>was under the dominance of his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who had been responsible for the deposition of the king's father.<ref>Ormrod (1990), p. 15.</ref> Montagu explained the king's situation, and [[Pope John XXII]] asked for a special signal that assure him that he was dealing with the king in person. After Montagu's return, [[Richard Aungerville|Richard Bury]], [[Lord Privy Seal|Keeper of the Privy Seal]], wrote to inform the pope that only letters containing the words ''pater sancte'' (holy father), in Edward's own handwriting, were indeed from the king. Only Edward, Bury and Montagu were party to the scheme.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 152.</ref>

==Coup against Mortimer==
When Mortimer discovered the conspiracy against him, Montagu was brought in for interrogation{{ndash}} along with the king{{ndash}} but gave nothing away.<ref name="PE223"/> Afterward he supposedly advised Edward to move against his protector, because "It was better that they should eat the dog than that the dog should eat them".<ref name="DNB"/> On 19 October 1330, while Mortimer and Isabella were entrenched in [[Nottingham Castle]], the constable of the castle showed Montagu a secret entrance through an underground tunnel.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 101.</ref> Along with Edward de Bohun, [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Robert Ufford]], and John Neville and others, he entered the castle, where he met up with the king.<ref name="DNB"/> A short brawl followed before Mortimer was captured. The queen stormed into the chamber shouting "Good son, have pity on noble Mortimer".<ref>Prestwich (2005), p. 224</ref> Edward did not obey his mother's wishes, and a few weeks later Mortimer was executed for treason in London.<ref>Prestwich (2005), pp. 223&ndash;4</ref> As a reward for his part in the ''coup,'' Montagu was given lands worth <U+00A3>1000, including the Welsh lordship of [[Denbigh]] that had belonged to Mortimer.<ref>Prestwich (2005), p. 416</ref> His family also benefited; his brother [[Simon Montacute|Simon]] became [[Bishop of Worcester]] and later of [[Bishop of Ely|Ely]].<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 153.</ref> Another brother, Edward de Montacute, 1st Baron Montacute, was married to [[Alice of Norfolk|Alice]], a co-heir of [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk]].<ref name="Douch 87">Douch (1951), p. 87.</ref>

==Service under Edward III==
[[File:Edward III of England (Order of the Garter).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward III of England|Edward III]] founded the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1348, and included Salisbury's son among in the founding members.]] In the years to come, Montagu acted as Edward's closest companion.<ref name="McK 152"/> In April 1331, the two went on a secret expedition to France, disguised as merchants so they would not be recognised. In September of the  same year, Montagu held a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] at [[Cheapside]], where he and the king were costumed as Tartars.<ref name="DNB"/> From 1333 onwards, Montagu was deeply engaged in the [[Second War of Scottish Independence|Scottish Wars]], and distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Halidon Hill#Berwick Under Siege|Siege of Berwick]] and the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]]. It was after this event that his lordship over the [[Isle of Man]] was recognised, a right he held from his grandfather.<ref name="DNB"/> The lordship was at the moment of a purely theoretical nature, however, since the island was still under Scottish control.

In February 1334 Montagu was sent on a commission to Edinburgh, to demand Edward Balliol's homage to Edward. In the great summer campaign of 1335, it was Montagu who provided the largest English contingent, with 180 [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 136 archers.<ref name="DNB"/> He was well rewarded for his contributions: after the Scots had been forced to cede the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], Montagu was granted the county of [[Peeblesshire]]. He was also allowed to buy the [[Ward (law)|wardship]] of Roger Mortimer's son [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March|Roger]] for 1000 [[Mark (money)|marks]], a deal that turned out to be very lucrative for Montagu.<ref>Mortimer later married Montagu's daughter Philippa; Prestwich (2005), p. 268</ref> At this point, however, the fortunes were turning for the English in Scotland. Montagu campaigned in the north again in 1337, but the siege of [[Dunbar]] met with failure.<ref>Douch (1951), p. 86.</ref> Following the abortive attempt in Scotland, Edward III turned his attention to the continent.

==The Hundred Years' War==
Montagu was created [[Earl of Salisbury]] on 16 March 1337. This was one of six [[comital]] promotions Edward III made that day, in preparation for what was to become the [[Hundred Years' War (1337<U+2013>1360)|Hundred Years' War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Given-Wilson|first=Chris|title=The English Nobility in the Late Middle Ages|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=1996|page=35|isbn=0415148839}}</ref> To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal [[Stannary|stannaries]] of Cornwall.<ref>Given-Wilson (1996), pp. 38&ndash;40.</ref> A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl on the eve of the wars{{ndash}} he would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]].<ref>Prestwich (2005), p. 343. According to Douch, the eye was lost in the Scottish Wars; Douch (1951), p. 86.</ref>

In April 1337, Montagu was appointed to a diplomatic commission to [[Valenciennes]], to establish alliances with [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and the [[Germany|German]] princes.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 121.</ref> In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing the greatest number of soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers.<ref name="DNB"/> In September of that year he was made [[Earl Marshal|Marshal of England]]. After the death of [[Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk|Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk]], this office had come into the hands of Norfolk's daughter [[Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk|Margaret]]. The king did not trust the office with her husband, so he decided instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prestwich|first=M.C.|title=The Three Edwards: War and State in England 1272-1377|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1996|edition=reprint|pages=190}}</ref> Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and when he left the Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Earl of Derby]].<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 163.</ref> The earl had earlier voiced concerns about the costly alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waugh|first=Scott L.|title=England in the Reign of Edward III|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|date=1991|page=220|isbn=0521325102}}</ref>

While Edward was away, Salisbury was captured by the French at [[Lille]] in April 1340, and imprisoned in [[Paris]].<ref name="DNB"/> Reportedly, King [[Philip VI of France]] wanted to execute Salisbury and [[Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Robert Ufford, Earl of Suffolk]], who was captured with him. Philip was, however, dissuaded by [[John of Bohemia]], who argued that the earls could come in handy in an exchange, should any French noblemen be captured.<ref>Prestwich (1996), p. 206</ref> Though released on parole in September, it was not until May 1342 that he reached a final settlement with the French. Salisbury was freed in a prisoner exchange, but only on the condition that he never fight in France again.<ref name="DNB"/>

==Final years==
[[File:Bisham - geograph.org.uk - 1155.jpg|thumb|Salisbury's residence of Bisham Manor in [[Berkshire]].]] Salisbury had long been frustrated by the failure of the government in England to provide sufficient funds for the war effort.<ref>Prestwich (2005), p. 275</ref> On his return, however, he played little part in the conflict of 1341 between King Edward and [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]] [[John de Stratford|John Stratford]]. In May that year he was appointed to a committee to hear the king's charges against Stratford, but little came from this.<ref>McKisack (1959), p. 177.</ref> In 1342&ndash;43 he fought with [[Robert III of Artois|Robert of Artois]] in the [[Breton War of Succession]], and in 1343 helped negotiate the [[Hundred_Years'_War_(1337-1360)#Truce_of_Malestroit_.281343.E2.80.931345.29|Truce of Malestroit]].<ref name="DNB"/> It was probably sometime after this he made good his claim on the Isle of Man, by conquering the island which was until then held by the Scots.<ref name="DNB"/>

His final international commission took place late in 1343, when he accompanied [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Derby]], on a diplomatic mission to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].<ref name="DNB"/> Early in 1344 he was back in England, where he took part in a great tournament at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]]. It was during this tournament, according to the chronicler [[Adam Murimuth]], that he received wounds that would prove fatal.<ref name="DNB"/> Salisbury died on 30 January 1344. He was buried at [[Bisham Abbey|Bisham Priory]] in [[Berkshire]], adjoining his home, Bisham Manor. He had founded the priory himself in 1337, on his elevation to the earldom.<ref>Prestwich (2005), p. 286</ref> King Edward's financial obligations were never paid in full during the earl's lifetime, and at Salisbury' death the king owed him <U+00A3>11,720. Of this, some <U+00A3>6374 were written off by his [[executor]]s in 1346.

==Family==
In or before 1327 Salisbury married [[Catherine Montacute, Countess of Salisbury|Catherine]], daughter of William de Grandison, 1st Baron Grandison. Two anecdotal stories revolve around Catherine Montagu; in one she is identified as the "Countess of Salisbury" from whose dropped garter Edward III named the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref name="DNB"/> In the other, Edward III falls in love with the countess, and arranges to be alone with her so he can rape her. Neither story is supported by contemporary evidence, and the latter almost certainly is a product of French propaganda.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Antonia | last=Gransden |title=The alleged rape by Edward III of the countess of Salisbury| journal=English Historical Review | volume=87 | year=1972|pages=333&ndash;44|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/563289}}</ref>

William and Catherine had six children, most of whom made highly fortunate matches with other members of the nobility.<ref name="Douch 87"/> The first Earl of Salisbury made enormous additions to the family fortune; at the time of his father's death, the lands had been valued at just over <U+00A3>300. In 1344, only the annual income of the lands has been estimated to more than <U+00A3>2,300,<ref name="Douch 87"/> equivalent to about <U+00A3>{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|2300|1344|r=-4}}}} in present day terms.{{inflation-fn|UK}} Edward was also free with granting [[Exclusive right|franchises]] to Salisbury, including the [[return of writs]], which gave the earl authority in his lands normally held by the royally appointed [[sheriff]].<ref>Ormrod (1990), p. 99.</ref> Salisbury's oldest son William succeeded his father in July 1349, while still a minor, as [[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Leland|first=John L.|authorlink=|title=Montagu, William, second earl of Salisbury (1328-1397)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/19002|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> The younger William was one of the founding members of the [[Order of the Garter]], but he never enjoyed the same favour with the king as his father had.<ref name="WW?"/>
