'''Ernest R. Emerson''' ([[March 7]], [[1955]])  is a custom knifemaker, [[martial artist]], and edged-weapons authority who founded Emerson Knives, Inc in 1996.  Once known for making "art knives", he later became better known as one of the knifemakers who started the Tactical Knife trend in the early 1990s with his award winning knives. Emerson's knives have been displayed as [[museum]] pieces, carried by [[Navy SEALs]], used by [[NASA]] in [[outer space]], and have been featured in books and films, making them valuable and popular with collectors.

Emerson's knifemaking career was born from his lifelong study of [[martial arts]].  His own personally developed fighting technique, Emerson Combat Systems, has been taught to [[police officers]], [[United States Special Operations Forces|elite military units]], and civilians worldwide; making Emerson a highly sought after combatives instructor, [[author]], and noted authority on edged-weapons in combat.    

==Background==
Ernest Emerson was born in a 20'X20' [[log cabin]] built by his grandfather in Northern [[Wisconsin]] on [[March 7]], [[1955]] and raised in a family of farmers, craftsmen, and teachers.<ref name ="combs">

==Early knifemaking==
[[Image:firstknife.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Emerson's first handmade balisong knife.]]
Although Emerson credits his grandfather's gift of a Barlow knife to him at the age of 8 years as starting his interest in knives, it was not until later in life when he turned to making one.<ref name="barlow"/>  The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a [[balisong knife]] for his studies of a [[Filipino Martial Art]] and unable to afford one on a working man's salary;<ref name ="herndon">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Herndon | Given=Bill| Title=The Emerson Evolution in Hard Use Knives | Journal=Blade Magazine | Volume=27 | Issue=8| Year=2000 | Page=133-138 }}</ref> Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead.<ref name="combs"/>  He [[Mill (grinding)|milled]] and drilled the handles from [[aluminium]] stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he handcut with a [[hacksaw]], shaped by [[File (tool)|files]], and heat treated at his dining room table with a [[butane]] torch.<ref name="combs"/><ref name="imb"/>

After starting classes with this "homemade knife", his instructors and students were impressed with his handiwork and asked him to make [[knives]] for them.<ref name="imb"/><sup id="fn_c_back">[[#fn c|c]]</sup><ref name ="tieves">
{{Harvard reference | Surname=Tieves | Given=Bruce| Title=Captain Tactical | Journal=Blade Magazine | Volume=25 | Issue=1| Year=1998 | Page=41-44 }}</ref>  Emerson did so and sold these early [[butterfly knife|butterfly knives]] for just the cost of materials, but soon had to raise his price to [[US$]]50 each as demand for his knives increased.<ref name="combs"/> Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but after seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding-knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided he was going to make folding [[Pocket knife|pocketknives]] from that point.<ref name="herndon"/><sup id="fn_d_back">[[#fn d|d]]</sup>  Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the [[Walker Linerlock]] mechanism on his own knives.<ref name="herndon"/><ref name ="ewing1"/><ref name ="basch">
{{Harvard reference | Surname=Basch | Given=Paul| Title=Searching for the Super Blade| Journal=The Blade Magazine | Volume=17 | Issue=12| Year=1990 | Page=34-37}}</ref>

==Pre-tactical models==
[[Image:pretacs.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Pre-Tac Folders.]]
Emerson's early folding knives were of the [[Walker Linerlock|linerlock]] variety and utilized rare materials that working in the [[aerospace]] industry gave him access to at the time, including [[titanium]], [[carbon fiber]], [[micarta]], and [[meteorite]].<ref name="edge">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Covert | Given=Pat| Title=Cutting Edge Knifemaker| Journal=American Handgunner Magazine | Volume=23 | Issue=133| Year=1998 | Page=70-75,122}}</ref><sup id="fn_e_back">[[#fn e|e]]</sup>  He also incorporated exotic materials common to knifemakers of the time including [[Mother of pearl]], [[abalone]] shell, [[paua]] shell, stag, and rare hardwoods into his pieces.<ref  name ="lang">{{Harvard reference | Surname = Lang | Given = Bud| Title = Emerson E1 Raven| Journal=Knives Illustrated | Volume=12 | Issue=12 | Year=1997| Page=64-65 }}</ref>  Writer Paul Basch reported in 1990 that Emerson refused to use the parts of any animal or plant which was an endangered species, noting Emerson as being an environmentally conscious knifemaker.<ref name="basch"/>   The steel used in these blades was typically ATS-34, AEB-L, or 440C and the blades were either highly polished or handrubbed, Emerson also made knives with [[Damascus steel]] blades.<ref name="basch"/>  Among custom knife collectors and purveyors today, these knives are  known as the "Pre-Tac" (Pre Tactical) models.<ref name="Norman"/>  They can be identified by their bright [[Anodising|anodized]] Titanium bolsters and liners and the predominant use of clip point blades.<ref name="basch"/>  The knives were also noted for their close tolerances and precise locking mechanisms.<ref name ="Norman"/>  Emerson credits the following knifemakers for helping him along durring his early years as a knifemaker: Michael Walker, Clint Breshears, Bob Engnath, and Jim Ferguson.<ref name="basch"/>

[[Image:bowie_logo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The rare Bowie Logo, which appeared on Emerson's early custom knives.]]
Emerson's first logo or stamp on these knives was "Emerson Knives" surrounding the outline of a [[Bowie knife]]; accordingly this is referred to as the rare "Bowie Logo", appearing on only a very small number of knives.  When a knife collector asked Emerson if he made Bowie knives, Emerson informed him that he did not.  The collector then advised him to change his logo or he might confuse the knife-buying public as they would ask for Bowie knives instead of linerlock folders.  Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word "knives" from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo.  This marking is known among collectors as the "Half-Moon Logo" and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives.<ref name ="Norman"/> 

These early knives sold for between $800 and $2,000 each; that combined with his appearance at knife shows and writeups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and credibility as a custom knifemaker.<ref name="tieves"/> Once established as a serious and reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make: knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.<ref name="tieves"/>

==Viper Knives==
[[Image:3 Vipers 1.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Viper Knives: MV-5, MV-3, and MV-1.]]  As a direct result of watching his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting-knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding-knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding-knife designed primarily for combat.<ref name="tieves"/>  Although Emerson always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting-knives first and foremost;<ref name="basch"/> in October 1988, he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials.<ref name="combs"/> He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high-tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used prior.<ref name="Norman"/>  He also retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to beadblast them a flat-grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives.<ref name="Norman"/>  The other reason for using titanium is because it provided an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and being a non-ferrous metal that does not rust it offered excellent corrosion resistance.<ref name="titanium">

Emerson ground the blades on these knives from ATS-34 steel with a [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness]] of 57-59 and made them thicker toward the tip, creating a stronger-tipped blade than he had made previously.<ref name="tieves"/> He bead-blasted the blades as he did the liners and bolsters, instead of rubbing or polishing them, giving them a matte-finish as opposed to the mirror-polished finish common on his earlier knives.<ref name="combs"/><ref name="walker"/>  Emerson designed each one of these knives for a specific purpose.  The slender Viper 1 and smaller Viper 2 were designed for use as a police officer's backup weapon.<ref name="Norman"/>  The Viper 5 was designed to be used by Naval boat-crews as the handle was contoured with a rear-brake to not slip from the user's hand when wet.<ref name="Norman"/>

[[Image:viperlogo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Viper Knives Logo.]]
Emerson's goal for this Viper line was to produce a working knife which would be more resistant to the elements and more durable than the "art knives" which he had become known for.<ref name="tieves"/><ref name="Norman"/>  These knives were created to satisfy the demand for a practical combat field-grade knife which could be carried discreetly and accessed quickly.<ref name="garrett"/>  He sold these five models under the name "Viper Knives" and changed the logo on the blades to read the same.<ref name="garrett"/><sup id="fn_f_back">[[#fn f|f]]</sup>  Emerson still makes these models to this day on a custom basis under the names MV1-5.<ref name="combs"/><ref name ="walker">Walker, Greg (1993).

==Specwar Knives==
[[Image:5 6s-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Five variants of the CQC6, top knife is a Super Sized version and with the knife below features the WAVE.]]
In the mid 1980s individual [[Navy SEALs]] from a [[West Coast]] Team had been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker, [[Phill Hartsfield]].<ref name="steele"/> Hartsfield's knives are hard ground from differentially heat treated A2 toolsteel known for their distinctive [[chisel]] ground blades.<ref name="steele">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Steele| Given=David E.| Title=The Hottest Grind of All | Journal=Blade Magazine | Volume=24 | Issue=3| Year=1997 | Page=16-18 }}</ref><ref name="tieves"/> More accurately they were also Zero ground, in that the edge had no secondary bevel allowing for no additional drag when used for cutting purposes.  Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives; which Hartsfield granted.<ref name="steele"/>  When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.<ref name="steele"/><ref name="profile"/><ref name="SEALS">

According to the SEALs requirements, the knife had to be corrosion resistant, designed for easy cleaning in the field, durable enough to be used on a daily basis as a tool, and capable as a weapon should the need arise.<ref name="garrett"/>  Emerson's folding chisel ground tanto became the sixth model in his Viper series and while a handful of prototypes were referred to as "Viper 6's"; the model was soon named the CQC6 ([[CQC]] refers to Close Quarter Combat) and was chosen by the SEALs for use.<ref name ="profile">Staff, Knives Illustated.

==Popularizing the tactical knife==
While not the first knifemaker to build what is known as a tactical folding knife, Emerson was one of several makers who popularized and perfected the concept of the handmade tactical folder in the 1990s.<ref name="pickles"/><ref name ="covert">Covert, Pat.

This surge in interest for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming.  Although he had been making knives full time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later.<ref name="tieves"/><ref name="lang"/>  As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, he realized that the demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them.<ref name="lang"/>  The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.<ref name="tieves"/> 

[[Image:timberline-specwar.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Emerson-Neely Timberline SPECWAR.]]
Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his SPECWAR model.<ref name="covert"/><ref name="dick"/><sup id="fn_k_back">[[#fn k|k]]</sup>  This model featured a one-side chisel ground tanto blade almost 1/4 inch thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass reinforced Nylon, molded around a near-full tang.

In 1994 the president of [[Benchmade|Benchmade Knives]], Les DeAsis, approached Emerson to manufacture the CQC6 on a larger scale as a factory production model.<ref name="Norman"/> Preferring to keep the CQC6 as a custom only knife, Emerson instead licensed a similar design of his, the CQC7.<ref name ="wsj"> {{cite news | last = Fritz | first = Mark | title = How New, Deadly Pocketknives Became a $1 Billion Business | publisher = The Wall Street Journal | date = [[2006-07-25]] | url =http://online.wsj.com/PA2VJBNA4R/article/SB115379426517016179-search.html |accessdate = 2007-01-02}}</ref><ref name="cqc7"/>

In February 1996, Emerson and his wife, Mary, founded Emerson Knives Inc. (also referred to as EKI) to manufacture knives on a larger scale than he was then capable.<ref name="herndon"/><ref name="tieves"/><ref name="lang"/> This new company would be a distinct entity from his Specwar lineup of custom knives, although several custom designs would make their way to production from time to time.  Four years after starting this venture, Emerson sold an entire year's worth of production in four hours at the [[SHOT Show|SHOT]] (Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade) Show in January of 2000.<ref name="shot">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Hopkins| Given=Cameron| Title=The Worse it Gets, the Better We Like It| Journal=American Handgunner Magazine | Volume=25 | Issue=157 | Year=2000 | Page=92-93}}</ref>

Emerson continued to collaborate with other companies on knife related projects as his own company grew, in some cases these collaborators were now his competition such as [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber Knives]].   In 2002 Emerson collaborated with Gerber Knives to create both companies' first [[switchblade|automatic opening knife]], the Gerber-Emerson Alliance.<ref name="auto">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Karwan| Given=Chuck| Title=Automatic Success| Journal=Tactical Knives | Volume=9 | Issue=6 | Year=2003| Page=50-54 }}</ref><sup id="fn_m_back">[[#fn m|m]]</sup>  In that same year, Emerson collaborated with [[Surefire|SureFire Flashlights]] by making an exclusive CQC8 (Banana Knife)numbered and marked with the SureFire logo and sold with an identically numbered Emerson marked Centurion C2 CombatLight.<ref name="lights"/>  In 2005 Emerson collaborated with Andy Prisco, the CEO of the American Tomahawk Company to produce the CQC-T [[Tomahawk (axe)|Tomahawk]].  This tomahawk features a curved head machined from 4140 steel with a rear spike and a lightweight fiberglass handle.  Although not made by Emerson, the tomahawk was designed by him.<ref >{{Harvard reference | Surname=Steele| Given=David E.| Title=Wedged Edges at War| Journal=Blade Magazine | Volume=32 | Issue=9 | Year=2005| Page=12-18 }}</ref>

The Navy, went to Emerson who designed and fabricated a working prototype within 24 hours.<ref name="combs"/> They found that it met their needs and the model was dubbed the SARK (Search and Rescue Knife).<ref name="covert"/> The SARK is a folding knife with a warncliffe-style blade and a blunt tip designed so a rescuer could cut free a trapped victim without stabbing them, the knife also features Emerson's Wave.<ref name="combs"/><sup id="fn_n_back">[[#fn n|n]]</sup>  Seeing another need in the [[police]] community, Emerson replaced the blunt end of the SARK with a pointed end and named it the P-SARK or Police Search And Rescue Knife. The [[Ontario, California]] Police Department consulted Emerson to produce written policy for the carry and deployment of the P-SARK knives in their department.<ref name="griffith">{{Harvard reference | Surname=Griffith| Given=David| Title=On the Cutting Edge| Journal=Police Magazine| Volume=10 | Issue=2 | Year=2002 | Page=68-75 }}</ref>

[[Image:nasaknife.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Emerson NASA Knife.]]
In [[1999]] [[NASA]] approached Emerson with a special request for a knife for use on [[Space Shuttle]] missions and the [[International Space Station]] to replace the Randall Model 17 Astronaut Knife.  Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement.  The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline with the addition of a guthook cut into the [[tanto]] point of the blade in order for the [[astronauts]]' to be able to open their [[freeze dried]] food packages.  The knife features the NASA logo and is not available for purchase outside of NASA.<ref>"Emerson Knives",''American Handgunner Magazine'', November, 2000</ref>

==Emerson's knives in popular culture==
Emerson's knives have appeared onscreen in films and television shows.  In ''Night of the Running Man'', [[Scott Glenn]]'s character carried a white-handled, one-of-a-kind Emerson CQC6.  Ravens, neck knives, and the Commander knife were featured in the short lived UPN television series, ''[[Soldier of Fortune, Inc.]]''<ref name="cutler"/>  

[[Ridley Scott|Ridley Scott's]] 2001 film ''[[Black Hawk Down]]'' portrayed soldiers carrying Emerson folding knives in the hangar scene; and in ''[[Tears of the Sun]]'', the Kandahar model appeared on [[Bruce Willis]]' character's web gear and other actors were seen with Emerson Police Utility Knives.<ref>
{{cite web | title=Internet Movie Database| work=Tears of the Sun|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0314353/trivia | accessmonthday=January 24 | accessyear=2007 }}</ref>  Frank Castle used an Emerson Karambit to kill an opponent in one of the final scenes in ''[[The Punisher]]''.  ''[[The Transporter 2]]'' briefly featured an Emerson fixed-blade Kandahar knife in the trunk of [[Jason Statham|Jason Statham's]] car along with other weapons.

Future projects mentioned in the ''Emerson Collector's Association Newsletter'' indicate the CQC-T Tomahawk and other knives are to be used in the upcoming movies ''[[Rambo IV]]'' and ''Alien Vs Predator 2''.<ref name="ECA">{{Citation| last =Emerson| first =Ernest| last2 =Emerson| first2 =Mary| title =ECA 2007| newspaper =Emerson Collector's Association Newsletter| pages = 2| year =2007| date=February}}</ref>

The main character "Solid Snake" of the tactical espionage Playstation game ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' uses an Emerson-style knife referred to as a "CQC Knife" throughout the game.  Screenshots show the knife to strongly resemble an Emerson fixed-blade tanto.

Emerson's knives are featured in mystery, spy, military, action and adventure novels.  At least seven of [[Richard Marcinko]]'s ''[[Rogue Warrior]]'' Novels, (''[[Red Cell]]'', ''Green Team'', ''Task Force Blue'', ''Detachment Bravo'', ''SEAL Force Alpha'', ''Violence of Action'', and ''Holy Terror'') prominently feature Emerson's knives (CQC6 or CQC7) as a regularly carried piece of equipment.<ref name="red">{{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko |coauthors=Weisman |title=Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell|year= 1994|publisher= Pocket Books|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-671-79956-8 |pages=108 }}</ref><ref name ="green">{{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko |coauthors=Weisman |title=Rogue Warrior: Green Team|year= 1995|publisher= Pocket Books|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-671-89671-7 |pages=3,18,56,78, 130-132, 204, 230, 265}} </ref><ref name="blue">{{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko |coauthors=Weisman |title=Rogue Warrior: Task Force Blue|year= 1996|publisher= Pocket Books|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-671-79958-4 |pages=4,22,107,153, 174-175.}}</ref><ref name="voa">{{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko|title= Violence of Action|year= 2002|publisher= Atria Books|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-743-42246-5 |pages=28,101,105,110,112,116,154 }}</ref><ref name ="Bravo"> {{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko |coauthors=Weisman |title=Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo|year= 2001|publisher= Pocket Books|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-671-00071-3 |pages=217,317,323}}</ref><sup id="fn_p_back">[[#fn p|p]]</sup><ref name="ht">{{cite book |last=Marcinko |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Marcinko |coauthors=DeFelice, Jim|title=Rogue Warrior: Holy Terror|year= 2006|publisher= Atria|location=New York |language=English |isbn=0-743-42248-1  |page=108 }}</ref>  The protagonist, Marcinko, uses an Emerson CQC6 or CQC7 on various occasions.

Emerson's study and instruction of martial arts is ongoing and continuing to this day.<ref name="herndon"/> He has accumulated close to 40 years of  experience in a variety of styles and philosophies of combat.<ref name="combs"/> As a result he has developed a unique fighting system known as Emerson Combat Systems, which has been taught to hundreds of law enforcement agencies, members of the U.S. Military, and civilians.<ref name="combs"/><ref name="herndon"/><ref name="tieves"/><ref name="steele"/><ref name="covert"/>

The purpose of Emerson Combat Systems is to give the student the tools to survive the first few seconds of a violent attack.  It is based upon the recognition of two factors: the human body's [[physiological]] response to [[stress]] and its reduction to the use of gross motor skills.<ref name="BladeU"/> All of the techniques are based upon the physical and instinctual laws that govern the survival instincts and physical function of a human being.<ref name="combatives"/> 
[[Image:ElbowStrike.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ernest Emerson demonstrates an elbow strike.]]
This system is based on techniques unencumbered by the ritual or "sport" aspects of martial arts and is characterized by training as realistically as possible and utilizing flowing, dynamic concepts (for example, Integrated Fighting Skills<sup id="fn_t_back">[[#fn t|t]]</sup> and Weapon Transition Skills<sup id="fn_u_back">[[#fn u|u]]</sup>) with a strong emphasis placed on overall physical fitness.<ref>Emerson, Ernest R. "Old World Skills Keep Today's Soldiers Alive", ''Tactical Gear Annual'', Summer 2005. 12-20</ref>  Emerson maintains he does not teach an "art", but a combat system where the goal is more than simple self defense, but also to overwhelm and destroy the opponent.<ref name="combatives"/><ref name="3rules"/><sup id="fn_v_back">[[#fn v|v]]</sup>

Along with the individual Martial Arts Instructor Rankings listed earlier, Emerson's teaching credentials include, California POST (Peace Officer Standards & Training) Instructor, Gunsite Instructor, Hand-to-hand Combat Instructor for H&K Defense Group, and Director of the Combat Research and Development Group.<ref name="trexpo">{{cite web | title=Ernest Emerson | work=TREXPO East 2006 |url=http://www.trexpo.com/east/t_inside.cfm?action=attendee&s_id=bio&ln=Emerson | accessdate=12-31-2006 }}</ref><ref name ="guzy"/><sup id="fn_w_back">[[#fn w|w]]</sup> Emerson is also an expert witness for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and has been consulted as a technical advisor to television and movie productions,<ref name="trexpo"/> including ''[[National Geographic]]'', specifically a program titled ''[[Fight Science]]''; due in part to his position as the Hand To Hand Combat Instructor for Global Studies Group Incorporated.<ref name ="waterman">Waterman, Steve.
