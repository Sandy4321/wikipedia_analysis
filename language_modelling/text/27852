Her first book, ''Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust'' (2006), is an autobiographical work detailing how she survived during the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. She was featured on [[PBS]] on one of [[Wayne Dyer]]'s programs, and also on a December 3, 2006 segment of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' (which re-aired on July 1, 2007).

''Left to Tell'' recounts how Immacul<U+00E9>e Ilibagiza survived for 91 days with another seven other women during the Rwandan Genocide in a damp and small bathroom, no larger than {{convert|3|ft|m}} long and {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide.
