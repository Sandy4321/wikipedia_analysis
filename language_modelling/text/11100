'''''Freedom from Want''''', '''''The Thanksgiving Picture''''' or '''''I<U+2019>ll Be Home for Christmas''''' is the third of the ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' series of four [[oil painting]]s by American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The works were inspired by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1941 [[State of the Union Address]], known as [[Four Freedoms]]. Until then, Freedom from Want was not a commonly understood or accepted universal freedom.

The painting was created in November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. All of the people in the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in [[Arlington, Vermont]], who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on [[Thanksgiving]] 1942 to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. ''The Post'' published ''Freedom from Want'' with a corresponding essay by [[Carlos Bulosan]] as part of the ''Four Freedoms'' series. Despite many who endured [[sociopolitical]] hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the [[socioeconomic]] hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.

The painting has had a wide array of adaptations, parodies, and other uses, such as for the cover for the 1946 book ''Norman Rockwell, Illustrator''.  Although the image was popular at the time in the United States and remains so, it caused resentment in Europe where the masses were enduring wartime hardship. Artistically, the work is highly regarded as an example of mastery of the challenges of white-on-white painting and as one of Rockwell's most famous works.

==Background==
''Freedom from Want'' is the third in a series of four oil paintings entitled ''[[Four Freedoms (Norman Rockwell)|Four Freedoms]]'' by [[Norman Rockwell]]. They were inspired by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the Union Address]], known as [[Four Freedoms]], delivered to the [[77th United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941.<ref name="U.S. News & World Report, L.P">{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|title=100 Documents That Shaped America:President Franklin Roosevelt's Annual Message (Four Freedoms) to Congress (1941)|accessdate=2008-04-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412075512/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/documents/docpages/document_page70.htm|archivedate=2008-04-12|publisher=U.S. News & World Report, L.P.|work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]}}</ref> In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism.<ref name=MaM7>{{cite book|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|author=Murray, Stuart and James McCabe|isbn=0-517-20213-1|publisher=[[Gramercy Books]]|year=1993|page=7}}</ref> The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the [[Atlantic Charter]],<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=7VjcHPR2lfcC&pg=PA49&dq=%22Four+Freedoms%22+Atlantic+Charter#v=onepage&q=%22Four%20Freedoms%22%20Atlantic%20Charter&f=false|title=2048: Humanity's Agreement to Live Together|author=Boyd, Kirk|isbn=1-4596-2515-3|page=12|publisher=ReadHowYouWant|year=2012|accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mhhecYMgUNsC&pg=PA287&dq=%22Four+Freedoms%22+Atlantic+Charter#v=onepage&q=%22Four%20Freedoms%22%20Atlantic%20Charter&f=false|title=The Kravchenko Case: One Man's War on Stalin|author=Kern, Gary|isbn=1-929631-73-1|page=287|publisher=[[Enigma Books]]|year=2007|accessdate=2014-08-21}}</ref> and it became part of the charter of the [[United Nations]].<ref name="U.S. News & World Report, L.P"/> The series of paintings ran in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'' (February 20), ''[[Freedom of Worship (painting)|Freedom of Worship]]'' (February 27), ''Freedom from Want'' (March 6), and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' (March 13).

The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FwF-AWzsLIYC&pg=PA72&dq=|title=Norman Rockwell: The Underside of Innocence|accessdate=2013-11-28|year=2006|isbn=0-226-31440-5|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]|pages=72<U+2013>73|author=Halpern, Richard}}</ref>

In mid-June Rockwell sketched in charcoal the ''Four Freedoms'' and sought commission from the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] (OWI). He was rebuffed by an official who said, "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're going to use fine artists men, real artists."<ref name=LaF/> However, ''Saturday Evening Post'' editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized the potential of the set and encouraged him to produce them right away.<ref name=LaF/> By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that ''Freedom from Want''  did not match Bulosan's text.  In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine was on the verge of being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell had better get the work published before relegation to halftone printing.<ref name=C307>{{cite book|title=Norman Rockwell: A Life|chapter=21: The Big Ideas|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2001|author=Claridge, Laura|pages=307<U+2013>308|isbn=0-375-50453-2}}</ref>

After the ''Four Freedoms'' series ran in ''The Saturday Evening Post'', the magazine made sets of reproductions available to the public and received 25,000 orders. Additionally the OWI, which six months earlier had declined to employ Rockwell to promote the Four Freedoms, requested 2.5 million sets of posters featuring the Four Freedoms for its war-bond drive in early 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/norman-rockwell-and-the-four-freedoms/|title=Norman Rockwell and the Four Freedoms|accessdate=2013-12-17|author=Heydt, Bruce|work=America in WWII|date=February 2006}}</ref>

Rockwell bequeathed this painting to a custodianship that became the Norman Rockwell Museum in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] and it is now part of the museum's permanent collection. Rockwell lived in Stockbridge from 1953 until his death in 1978.<ref name=FFWaNRaamtn/>

Despite Rockwell's general optimism, he had misgivings about having depicted such a large turkey when much of Europe was "starving, overrun [and] displaced" as [[World War II]] raged.<ref name=TAlbaNRiiFFW/><ref name=ANDFTW>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Wk9tVC7WwyoC&pg=PT24&dq=%22Freedom+From+Want%22+Rockwell#v=onepage&q=%22Freedom%20From%20Want%22%20Rockwell&f=false|title=A New Deal For The World|accessdate=2013-11-28|year=2007|isbn=0-674-28192-6|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=|author=Borgwardt, Elizabeth}}</ref><ref name=BHRH>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=eyDQEt3tKoEC&pg=PA33&dq=%22Freedom+From+Want%22+Rockwell#v=onepage&q=%22Freedom%20From%20Want%22%20Rockwell&f=false|title=Bringing Human Rights Home: Portraits of the movement|accessdate=2013-11-28|year=2007|isbn=0-275-98821-X|publisher=[[Praeger Perspectives]]|page=33|editor=Albisa, Catherine, Martha F.

He parallels the emotional nourishment provided by the image to that of the food nourishment that it depicts, remarking that the picture is noticeably inviting. However, by depicting the table with nothing but empty plates and white dishes on white linen, Rockwell may have been invoking the [[Puritan]] origins of the Thanksgiving holiday.<ref name=NRTUoI>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=FwF-AWzsLIYC&pg=PA72&dq=|title=Norman Rockwell: The Underside of Innocence|accessdate=2013-11-28|year=2006|isbn=0-226-31440-5|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]|page=72|author=Halpern, Richard}}</ref>

To Robert Hughes, the painting represents the theme of family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water.<ref name=AV>{{cite book|title=American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America|author=Hughes, Robert|isbn=0-679-42627-2|publisher=Alfred A.

One of the notable and artistically challenging elements of the image is Rockwell's use of white-on-white: white plates sitting on a white tablecloth.<ref name=FFWaNRaamtn/><ref name=HaK102/> Art critic [[Deborah Solomon]] describes this as "one of the most ambitious plays of white-against-white since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]'s ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl|Symphony in White, No. 1]]''".<ref name=S210/> Solomon further describes the work as "a new level of descriptive realism.

Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard [[liberalism]] philosophies of the [[western world]] than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration.<ref name=RftM>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oNKyvL7ccB4C&pg=PR21&dq=|title=Realism for the Masses: Aesthetics, Popular Front Pluralism, and U.S. Culture, 1935<U+2013>1947|accessdate=2013-11-30|year=2009|isbn=1-60473-123-0|page=XXI|author=Vials, Chris|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]}}</ref> In his essay, Bulosan treats [[Negative liberty|negative liberties]] as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of [[Karl Marx]]'s "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs".<ref name=RotL>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=nMdZeP-6oGQC&pg=PA307&dq=|title=Regionalists on the Left: Radical Voices from the American West|accessdate=2013-11-29|year=2013|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=0-8061-4340-1|page=307|author=Steiner, Michael C.}}</ref>  In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase "The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" describes an egalitarian America.<ref name=RotL/>  In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'',<ref name=TBoC/><ref name=RftM/> Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as "haunting and sharp" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state had an obligation to provide a basic level of subsistence.<ref name=TBoC/> Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the [[New Deal]] had not already granted freedom from want as it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.<ref name=TPoC/>
