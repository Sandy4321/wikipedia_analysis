'''James Warren White''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born [[2 May]] [[1962]]) is an [[English people|English]] professional [[snooker]] player, best known as '''Jimmy White'''. Nicknamed the "Whirlwind" (and occasionally the "People's Champion"){{fact|date=August 2008}}, White is a multiple World Championship finalist. He has been a professional since 1980, the year in which he won the World Amateur title.

==Early life==
White was born in [[Tooting]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], and studied at [[Ernest Bevin College]]. He never achieved academic success, as he was often [[truant]] from school from the age of eight or nine, spending more and more time at Ted Zanicelli's [[Pool hall|snooker hall]]. It was around this time that he met [[Tony Meo]] with whom he would compete in [[hustling|money matches]] in many venues.<ref>{{cite book | last = White | first = Jimmy | co-authors = and Rosemary Kingsland | year = 1998 | title = Behind the White Ball: My Autobiography | publisher = Hutchinson | location = London | isbn = 0-09-180126-5}}</ref> His natural aptitude for snooker led to a successful amateur career. After winning the [[English Amateur Championship]] in 1979, a year later he became the youngest ever winner of the World Amateur Snooker Championship, aged 18.

==Career==
With a host of major titles and achievements, including ten ranking tournaments, White's overall record ranks puts him well up the list of snooker's most successful players. The BBC describes him as a "legend".<ref name="BBCWhirl">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6572815.stm Whirlwind Q&A]<!--THIS IS NOT A PROPER REF CITATION. Use [[Template:Cite web]].--></ref> A left-hander, he reached the World Professional Championship Final on six occasions (1984, 1990-1994) but failed to win the sport's most prestigious title since his first attempt in 1981.   Nonetheless, his consistency waned in the 2000s and a first-round defeat in the 2006 World Championship saw White drop out of the world's top 32 [[Snooker world rankings|player rankings]]. On 20 July 2006, White said that he would go off and play golf in Spain if he thought he had no chance of regaining his former competitiveness: "I guarantee you I will be in the top 16 for next year. I am far too good.{{fact|date=July 2008}} White's continued slide down the rankings saw him drop to 65th (as of May 2008). However, he remains in the 2008-09 professional tour.

The World Championship has provided the theatre for White's greatest disappointments. In 1982, he led [[Alex Higgins]] 15-14 in their nip-and-tuck semi-final, was up 59-0 in the penultimate {{Cuegloss|Frame|frame}} and a {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red}} and {{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour}} away from the final. However, he eventually succumbed to Higgins' fightback. In the 1984 final he trailed [[Steve Davis]] 12-4 at the end of the first day's play, made a determined comeback, yet eventually lost by a margin of only 18-16.

In 1992, he led [[Stephen Hendry]] 12-6 and then 14-8. After Hendry pulled back to 14-9, White needed to {{Cuegloss|Pot|pot}} only one red to win both the 24th and 25th frames, obstacles he could not overcome. After the deficit was reduced further to 12-14, White went {{Cuegloss|In-off|in-off}} when compiling a potentially frame-winning break. Hendry drew level at 14-14 without conceding a further {{Cuegloss|Point|point}} and won the closely contested 29th and 30th frames to lead 16-14. Two {{Cuegloss|Century|century}} {{Cuegloss|#Break|breaks}} completed Hendry's ten-frame winning streak and a remarkable 18-14 victory. White's defeat may be attributed to a combination of his own inability to secure crucial frames from winning positions, to an opponent who played his best snooker as White faltered, and, less importantly, to one or two instances of bad luck.  White admitted later that he had been drinking the night before and that this was a contributing factor to his downfall.{{fact|date=January 2009}}

White also reached the final in 1993 but found Hendry much too strong: his 5-18 defeat was the second heaviest reverse in a final in the modern era. However, arguably his best chance came in the 1994 final, his fifth consecutive and third in a row against Hendry. White trailed 1-5 early on but recovered well to lead 10-9. Hendry again surged clear 15-13 and 17-16 but a break of 75 from White took the match to a decider. In the final frame, White was on a break of 29 and leading the frame by 37 points to 24. He then missed an easy black off its spot, after which commentator [[Dennis Taylor]] observed: "Dear me, that was just a little bit of tension". Had White potted the {{Cuegloss|Black ball|black}}, he would have been required to pot only three more reds (with blacks) to leave Hendry needing penalty points to win. As it happened, Hendry cleared with a technically straightforward break of 58 to win the title. Gracious in defeat, White joked that Hendry was "beginning to annoy" him in the post-match interview.

White became the first player to beat Hendry twice at the World Championship, when he added a 1998 first-round win (10-4 after leading 7-0 and 8-1) to his 13-12 second-round success over Hendry ten years earlier. The feat has since been matched by [[Matthew Stevens]] and [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]].

White is one of only six players to have completed a [[Highest snooker break|maximum 147 break]] at the World Championship (1992). He has also compiled 253 competitive centuries during his career.

Rather than being deficient in any technical aspect of the game, for instance he is very proficient in using the rest, it is arguable that occasional moments of inconsistency or lack of concentration, particularly at critical points in a match, have cost White dearly. But for these, his record could have been even better. His improvement in the 2003-04 season also highlighted how tough a player White could be when he adopted a more disciplined approach and reined in his array of shots.

Despite being best known for snooker, he is also a [[Pocket billiards|pool]] player. Along with Steve Davis and Alex Higgins, White was a member of Europe's victorious [[Mosconi Cup]] team of 1995, and won the deciding match against [[Lou Butera]].
