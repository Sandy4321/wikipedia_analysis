===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1996<U+2013>1999)===
[[Mark LoMonaco|Buh-Buh Ray]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von]] (two of the many on-screen sons of Willy Loman-esque "Big Daddy" Dudley) began wrestling together in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in 1996.<ref name=hardy29>Peterson Kaelberer, Angie.

With the departure of The Sandman, the Dudley Boyz took advantage of Sabu's ban from competing in the US, and D-Von defeated Rob Van Dam in singles competition for their sixth ECW World Tag Team Title.<ref name=slambio/> With a brewing feud between the Dudleys and the [[Impact Players]], ([[Justin Credible]] and [[Lance Storm]]) Buh Buh Ray and D-Von still had their hands full with the new team of Spike Dudley and Balls Mahoney.

===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (1999<U+2013>2005)===
[[File:Dudley Boys 1999 WWF Smackdown (WWE).jpg|thumb|left| The Dudley Boyz in their early WWF attire.]]
In 1999, Buh Buh Ray and D-Von joined the World Wrestling Federation. They requested a $1 raise above the WWF's offer to stay in ECW, but their request was denied because ECW owner [[Paul Heyman]] was working a deal with Vince McMahon to supply talent to the WWF.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Rise and Fall of ECW|people=Kevin Dunn III|date=2004-11-16|medium=[[DVD]]|url=http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-Tammy-Lynn-Sytch/dp/B0001Y4LZU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1221857690&sr=8-1|accessdate=2008-08-19|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Upon entering the WWF, Buh Buh Ray was renamed "Bubba Ray Dudley" and began sporting thick black glasses with white tape around them. He also began stuttering his promos - returning to a character trait he had initially used early in his ECW tenure.<ref name=slambio/> D-Von began wearing thick white glasses with black tape and slapping Bubba in the back of the head to help him get his words out. After several weeks, most of the gimmick was dropped. They also dropped their classic tie-dye attire and begin wearing [[military camouflage|camouflage]]-like ring attire.

While part of the WWF, the Dudley Boyz's claim to fame was bringing the use of [[Furniture#Table|tables]] as weapons into the wrestling mainstream, often using their signature double-team move, the [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Dudley Death Drop|3D]], to put their opponents through one of these tables. They were initially villains and were known for Bubba Ray's penchant for driving women (including [[Terri Runnels]], [[Trish Stratus]], [[Amy Dumas|Lita]], and [[Mae Young]]) through tables however they became fan favorites in mid 2000 when they engaged in a feud with the then villainous [[D-Generation X]] stable which culminated in a tag team table dumpster match at [[King of the Ring#2000|King of the Ring 2000]] in which Bubba drove [[Terri Poch|Tori]] through a table.<ref name=slambio/> Throughout 2000 and 2001, the Dudley Boyz engaged in a three way feud for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] with the [[Hardy Boyz]] and [[Edge and Christian]].<ref name=slambio/> The feud incorporated two [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match|Tables, Ladders and Chairs]] (TLC) matches, the first at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]] in 2000.<ref>Peterson Kaelberer, Angie. ''The Hardy Boyz: Pro Wrestlers Matt and Jeff Hardy'', p.28.</ref> The second was at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] in April 2001, in which Spike Dudley (who had joined the WWF in early-2001) interfered to aid the Dudleys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingWM17/wm17_powell-can.html|title=Austin turns heel at WM X-Seven|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

[[Image:Duchessofdudleyville.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Stacy Keibler]] as the "Duchess of Dudleyville" at [[WrestleMania X8]]]]
In mid-2001, the Dudley Boyz became villains again by joining [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]], a massive [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|group of wrestlers]] mostly consisting of former ECW and WCW wrestlers led by [[Shane McMahon]] and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, who attempted to take over the WWF.<ref name=slambio/> During this time, the Dudleys acted as enforcers of the Alliance, interfering on the behalf of Alliance mid-carders and main eventers. [[Stacy Keibler]] became the Dudleys' manager during this time<U+2014> dubbed the "Duchess of Dudleyville" by ECW manager Paul Heyman<U+2014>but she later cost the Dudleys a tag team match, and they put her through a table.<ref name=slambio/> During the storyline, they became the first tag team to ever hold the WCW, ECW, and WWE Tag Team Championships.<ref name=slambio/> Later, The Dudleys beat the Hardy Boyz in a cage match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] in 2001 to unify the WWF and WCW Tag Team Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/nov19_survivor-can.html|title=WWF pulls out Survivor Series win|last=Powell|first=John| publisher=SLAM!

Following [[WrestleMania X8]] in March 2002, the WWF was renamed "World Wrestling Entertainment" (WWE) and the roster was divided into two brands, [[WWE Raw|Raw]] and [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]. The Dudley Boyz were separated for a short time when Bubba Ray was [[WWE Draft|drafted]] to ''Raw'' and D-Von to ''SmackDown!''.<ref name=slambio/> Bubba became a fan favorite again by reuniting with Spike Dudley while D-Von, who was still a villain, went on to become the corrupt preacher character "Reverend D-Von" and gained a protege with [[Dave Batista|Deacon Batista]].<ref name=slambio/> At [[WWE Judgment Day#2002|Judgment Day]] in 2002, Bubba Ray was in the corner of ''Raw's'' [[Trish Stratus]], who was defending the [[WWE Women's Championship]] against Keibler; D-Von and Batista were in Stacy's corner as asked by [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]]. After Stratus successfully retained her title, Bubba Ray and D-Von stood in the ring and shook hands before an altercation broke out between the three men where D-Von and Batista ended up driving Bubba through a table.<ref name=slambio/> As 2002 went along, Bubba Ray teamed with Spike on ''Raw'' to form a new version of the Dudley Boyz.<ref name=slambio/>

Bubba and D-Von reunited following the [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]], when D-Von helped Bubba Ray in a match.<ref name=slambio/> From then on, he was back on ''Raw'' (as he was part of a package deal that would send [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] to ''SmackDown!''). After the Dudley Boyz were back together they became an alliance in the ''Raw'' tag team division over the next sixteen months. During this time, alternating between siding with and feuding with ''Raw'' General Manager, [[Eric Bischoff]].<ref name=slambio/> They continued competing in the tag team division  until all three Dudleys were drafted/traded over to ''SmackDown!'' in March 2004,<ref name=slambio/> Bubba Ray and D-Von aligned with Paul Heyman and feuded with [[The Undertaker]].<ref name=keith95/> By July, the Dudleys were helping Spike win matches by interfering in his favor, which Spike seemed to dislike at first,<ref name=spike/> only to reveal his hand as the "boss" of the outfit after they helped him take the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] from [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]].<ref name=slambio/><ref name=spike/> This was a very ironically fitting role, as while Spike is considered the "little brother" due to easily being the smallest of the three, he's actually the oldest in real life.

After a lengthy hiatus, Bubba, D-Von, and Spike made what would be their final appearance at a WWE sanctioned event, when they were a part of the original [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|One Night Stand]] in June 2005.<ref name=slambio/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2005/06/13/1084767.html|title=One great Night of hardcore nostalgia|last=Gramlich| first=Chris|publisher=SLAM!

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005<U+2013>present)===
[[File:Team 3D with a fan.jpg|thumb|250px|Team 3D with a fan.]]
On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Bubba and D-Von (now under the names Brother Ray and Brother Devon, respectively) had signed multi-year contracts with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), as Team 3D. Team 3D made their first appearance on the October 1 episode of ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', helping save the [[3Live Kru]] ([[Ron Killings]], [[Konnan]], and [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]]) from [[Planet Jarrett]] and [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]]. Team 3D's first rivalry in TNA was against [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm]]) (AMW), which included a mock "funeral" for the careers of Team 3D.<ref name=slambio/> At the TNA's December pay-per-view [[TNA Turning Point#2005|Turning Point]] in 2005, Team 3D successfully defeated AMW in a Tables match.<ref name=slambio/> At [[Final Resolution (2005)|Final Resolution]] on January 15, 2006, Team 3D fought AMW again, but this time for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]], which AMW held.<ref name=slambio/> They won the match, however, due to Team Canada's interference the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] awarded the match to AMW.<ref name=slambio/>

On the April 13 episode of ''Impact!'', Spike Dudley, now referred to as "Brother Runt", debuted in TNA, helping Team 3D beat Team Canada.<ref name=slambio/> At TNA's April pay-per-view [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown]], Team 3D defeated Team Canada in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Six Sides of Steel]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Flag match|Anthem match]]. Ray and Devon then started a rivalry with [[New Age Outlaws|The James Gang]] (B.G. James and [[Monty Sopp|Kip James]]),<ref name=slambio/> with the two teams meeting at TNA's June pay-per-view [[Slammiversary (2006)|Slammiversary]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|match which no can be counted count or disqualified]]; Ray and Devon claimed victory in the match. After their brief absence, Ray and Devon made a return to TNA in October 2006 and went back on the tag title hunt.<ref name=slambio/> They first fought with [[The Naturals]] ([[Chase Stevens]] and [[Andy Douglas]]), who defeated Team 3D in their signature tables match.<ref name=slambio/>
[[File:Team3dlockdown.jpg|thumb|left|Team 3D in an electrified steel cage at LockDown in 2007.]]
At the beginning of 2007, Team 3D were announced as the number one contenders to the [[The Latin American Xchange]]'s (LAX) NWA World Tag Team Championship and faced them at TNA's January pay-per-view [[Final Resolution#2007|Final Resolution]].<ref name=slambio/> During the match, however, Runt was scripted to appear drunk, wearing a [[Santa Claus]] outfit, and interfere, causing Team 3D to get disqualified. They continued their rivalry with LAX at TNA's March pay-per-view [[Destination X#2007|Destination X]] in a match which neither team could be disqualified called a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|Ghetto Brawl]] by TNA, in which they lost after interference from [[Alex Shelley]]. At [[Lockdown (2007)|Lockdown]] in 2007, Team 3D defeated LAX in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Electrified Cage match|Electrified Six Sides of Steel match]] to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=slambio/> In this match, the cage was electrified by electrical powerlines, to give the illusion when a wrestler touched the cage, they would be instantly electrocuted, in storyline.

On May 13, 2007, the Executive Director of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) announced Team 3D had been stripped of the NWA World Tag Team Championship due to the permanent discontinuation of the relationship between the NWA and TNA Wrestling. TNA continued to recognize Team 3D as their World Tag Team Champions and were then designated as the very first official [[TNA World Tag Team Championship|TNA World Tag Team Champions]], and the new TNA World Tag Team Championship belts were unveiled on their "TNA Today" webcast on May 16, 2007. On the broadcast they were awarded the new championship by [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Management Director|authority figure]] [[Jim Cornette]]. Before the new championship was unveiled, Team 3D successfully defended their champion status at TNA's May pay-per-view [[TNA Sacrifice#2007|Sacrifice]] in a standard tag team match involving three teams known as a[[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|3-Way Dance]], which also including the teams of Tomko ([[Travis Tomko]]) and Scott Steiner ([[Scott Steiner|Scott Rechsteiner]]) and LAX. After the match, Steiner's brother, Rick Steiner ([[Rick Steiner|Robert Rechsteiner]]), came out and attacked Team 3D which set up a match between the two teams at [[Slammiversary (2007)|Slammiversary]] for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Scott, however, could not compete due to a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] injury; instead Road Warrior Animal ([[Joseph Laurinaitis]]) took his place, but Team 3D retained the championship. On the June 21 episode of ''Impact!'', Cornette announced a "Champions versus Champions" match for TNA's July pay-per-view [[TNA Victory Road#2007|Victory Road]], in which the Tag Team Champions would face the World Champion and the [[TNA X Division Championship|X Division Champion]].<ref name=slambio/> At Victory Road, Team 3D lost the championship to Samoa Joe after interference from [[the Steiner Brothers]].<ref name=slambio/>

On the following ''Impact!'', they blamed the Steiner Brothers ''and'' the fans (who had actually been taking intervals to chant "3D sucks" for weeks at the time) for their loss. At [[TNA Hard Justice#2007|Hard Justice]] and [[Bound for Glory (2007)|Bound for Glory]], Team 3D lost to the Steiner Brothers,<ref name=slambio/> the latter defeat coming in a two out of three tables match after [[Chris Sabin]] and Alex Shelley, [[the Motor City Machineguns]], interfered on the Steiners' behalf. On the October 18 ''Impact!'', Team 3D assaulted the Machine Guns in the middle of their match, whipping them with studded belts and simultaneously powerbombimg then through two tables while Ray derided the supposedly terrible quality of the Guns' match. Team 3D continued on this path of attack and verbal putdown, directing it towards the Guns' fellow TNA X Division wrestlers. This led to a match against the Guns at [[TNA Genesis#2007|Genesis]], which Shelley and Sabin won.<ref name=slambio/> They later stole [[Jay Lethal]]'s belt and kidnapped X-Division wrestler [[Johnny Devine]], who subsequently turned on his fellow X Division wrestlers. While still referred to by most as Johnny, Ray and Devon called Devine "Brother Devine" and treated him as a member of Team 3D, though he did not share the half brother backstory. [[TNA Against All Odds#2008|At Against All Odds]], Team 3D and Johnny Devine fought The Motor City Machineguns and Jay Lethal in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]] but lost. Per the match stipulation, Ray and Devon could not compete unless they weighed in at 275&nbsp;lbs. or lower.
[[Image:TNA Bound to Glory IV (47 of 136).jpg|thumb|right|260px|Team 3D at [[Bound for Glory IV]].]]
After Against All Odds, 3D were matched with [[Shark Boy]] and [[Christopher Daniels|Curry Man]] on numerous occasions in tag matches, with either one or both of the brothers being unable to compete due to the weight restriction. The week before Destination X, a stipulation was added to the match between 3D and Shark Boy and Curry Man: if Ray and Devon did not each weigh in at under 275 pounds, they would be fired from TNA. Both Ray and Devon made weight, and as such never had to weigh in under 275 ever again. Shortly afterward, Devine returned to competing for the X-Division Title, his association with Team 3D being quietly phased out for a time, though it would soon return. As this went on, 3D, meanwhile, became part of several loose collectives of self-identified "bad guys" and "scumbags", aligning them at some point or another with almost every important villain on the TNA roster, including but not limited to [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Kurt Angle]]. They would begin a feud with [[Jason Reso|Christian Cage]], [[Terry Gerin|Rhino]] and [[A.J. Styles]] attacking them on several occasions. Their feud ended at [[Hard Justice (2008)|Hard Justice]] with Cage and Rhino defeating them in a "New Jersey Street Fight". They then began a feud with the team of "The Monster" Abyss and [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]], both teams competed at [[No Surrender (2008)|No Surrender]] with Abyss and Morgan picking up the victory.

Team 3D turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] when they joined the TNA Frontline after appearing to join Kurt Angle's [[The Main Event Mafia|Main Event Mafia]], double crossing them and jumping them along with Frontline leaders Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles and Rhino.  They also attempted to put Angle through a table. At Final Resolution in December, Team 3D along with Styles and Joe lost to the Main Event Mafia in an eight man tag team match. After Against All Odds 2009 Team 3D began a feud with [[Beer Money, Inc.]] [[James Storm]] and [[Robert Roode]] over the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]]. They faced each other in an Off the wagon challenge match (where if 3D lost then the person who lost is [[kayfabe]] fired). Beer Money lost by countout.  On April 19, 2009, at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], [[IWGP Tag Team Championship|IWGP Tag Team Champions]] Team 3D defeated Beer Money, Inc. to win the TNA World Tag Team Championships in a match where both titles were on the line. This made Team 3D World Tag Team Champions for the 22nd time. On June 21, 2009, at  [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], Beer Money, Inc. defeated Team 3D to become three-time TNA World Tag Team Champions after outside interference from [[The British Invasion (professional wrestling)|The British Invasion]] of [[Nick Aldis|Brutus Magnus]], [[Doug Williams (wrestler)|Doug Williams]] and [[Rob Terry]].<ref>http://www.tnawrestling.com/content/view/1564/84/</ref> Soon after, 3D then reignited their feud with the Main Event Mafia from late 2008 by becoming number 1 contenders to face [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and Scott Steiner for the TNA Tag Team Championships. After a failed attempt at the titles, they started a long feud with The British Invasion and other members of World Elite. Team 3D was attacked by World Elite on multiple occasions, until (now fan favorite) Beer Money Inc. intervened, leading to a loose partnership between the two teams.

On October 18, 2009, at [[Bound for Glory (2009)|Bound for Glory]], Team 3D captured their 23rd tag team championship when they defeated Beer Money, the British Invasion, and The Main Event Mafia's Scott Steiner and Booker T in a [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match#Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match]]. With both the IWGP and TNA Tag tiles on the line, they captured the IWGP titles, which the British Invasion had beaten them for, only for the Brits to take them out and win what at the time were Booker and Steiner's TNA tag championships moments later.<ref name=bfg09>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_36107.shtml|title=TNA Bound For Glory PPV Report 10/18: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of the pre-game and first hour of the show|last=Parks|first=Greg|date=2009-10-18|work=PWTorch|accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref> During the following weeks Team 3D once again turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and aligned themselves with Rhino in a battle against the younger talent of the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_36579.shtml|title=CALDWELL'S TNA IMPACT REPORT 11/5: Complete coverage of Dixie Carter addressing TNA roster, Styles vs. Daniels|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2009-11-05|work=PWTorch|accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_36725.shtml|title=WILKENFELD'S TNA IMPACT REPORT 11/12: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of Spike TV broadcast|last=Wilkenfeld|first=Daniel|date=2009-11-12|work=PWTorch|accessdate=2009-11-13}}</ref> On the November 19 edition of ''Impact!''

===Japan and independents===
Aside from TNA, Team 3D has also participated in many [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Hustle (professional wrestling)|Hustle]]'s shows after their WWE release. Team 3D held an unbeaten streak in All Japan, where they won All Japan's [[World's Strongest Tag Team League#2005|Real World Tag League in 2005]]. Team 3D has also won HUSTLE's [[Hustle Super Tag Team Championship|tag title]] in 2006, which they held until the promotion folded in October 2009. Team 3D also appeared in the [[Pro Wrestling Alliance]] June show, defeating [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and Dawg in the main event. Team 3D has also participated in two of the [[January 4 Dome Show]] PPV events for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]. [[January 4 Dome Show#Wrestle Kingdom II in Tokyo Dome|In 2008]], they won a hardcore match against [[Togi Makabe]] and Toru Yano. [[January 4 Dome Show#Wrestle Kingdom III in Tokyo Dome|The following year]], Team 3D were booked to face Makabe and Yano, at that time the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship|IWGP Tag Team Champions]], and the team of [[Satoshi Kojima]] and [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]] in a three-way match for the Tag Team title, later with a Hardcore rules stipulation added. However, days before the event, the team of Kojima and Tenzan withdrew due to Tenzan sustaining a serious eye injury which required an operation.<ref>[http://www.puroresufan.com/njpw/?p=299 Strong Style Spirit <U+00BB> Blog Archive <U+00BB> Tenzan seriously injured; TenKoji off 1/4]</ref> Team 3D won the resulting tag match against Makabe and Yano to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship, thus making them 22-time tag-team champions. On the July 30 edition of ''TNA Impact!'' The British Invasion of Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams defeated Team 3D in a tables match to win the tag titles. Team 3D would later regain the IWGP titles on October 18, 2009 at TNA Bound For Glory by defeating Beer Money, Booker T and Scott Steiner, and the British Invasion to capture their 24th Tag Team Championship. On January 4, 2010, at [[January 4 Dome Show#Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome|Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome]] Team 3D lost the IWGP Tag Team Titles to [[Tetsuya Nait<U+014D>]] and [[Yujiro Takahashi|Yujiro]] in a three-way hardcore match, which also included [[Matt Bloom|Giant Bernard]] and [[Karl Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/content/view/11848/|title=January 4 New Japan Tokyo Dome report - legends, promotional wars|date=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-04|publisher=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer]]}}</ref>
