'''Lego 4+''' (also previously known as ''4 Juniors'' in 2003) was a [[Lego]] theme for children 4 years old or more.<ref name="legobook">{{Cite book|last = Lipkowitz|first = Daniel|title = The Lego Book|publisher = Dorling Kindersley|date = 2009|pages = 177|isbn = 978-1-4053-4169-1}}</ref> The product range used regular Lego bricks but came with a different kind of [[minifigure]] that were larger and couldn't be disassembled. The sets tended to have a small number of larger pieces, in order to be easy to put together.
