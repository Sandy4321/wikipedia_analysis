"'''Ocean's Three and a Half'''" is the seventh episode of the seventh season of ''[[Family Guy]]''. It first aired in the United States on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]] on February 15, 2009. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decides to induce his friend [[Joe Swanson]]'s wife [[List of characters from Family Guy#The Swansons|Bonnie]] into labor so that Joe will be able to spend more time with him. Bonnie gives birth to a baby girl named Susie, but Joe then has trouble with medical bills. Peter, Joe, [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] decide to rob Peter's father-in-law, [[Pewterschmidt family#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter Pewterschmidt]]. Peter's wife and Pewterschmidt's daughter, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], convinces Joe to stop. Lois gets the money from Pewterschmidt by telling him she needs the money for a divorce lawyer. A subplot involves [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], who becomes infatuated with Bonnie's daughter Susie.

The episode includes a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] [[parody]] of [[Christian Bale]]'s rant on the set of ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', with actual audio clips of Bale interspersed with Peter's voice. The spoof received positive reception from the television critics for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. The episode received a positive overall review on the video game website [[IGN]].

==Plot==
Frustrated that [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] is growing more concerned that Bonnie is due to give birth within days, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]]  attempts to induce labor so Joe will spend more time with him, [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]. Peter plays ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' near Bonnie, hoping that the baby will come out to change the channel. When Bonnie finally gives birth to her baby, a girl named Susie, Joe is unable to pay the $20,000 he needs for her medical bills. He turns to a [[loan shark]] for the money, but ends up in debt to him. Peter and his friends turn to [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] for the money to pay off the loan shark, but Carter refuses as he thinks it would be funnier. In one final act of desperation, Peter decides they should rob Carter. Once they reach the vault, however, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] arrives on the scene and convinces Joe to stop. Lois talks Carter into providing the money, telling him she is using it for a divorce lawyer. When Peter asks her if she is joking, Lois says nothing, leaving Peter somewhat worried. Carter gives the money to Lois as opposed to Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland, and Joe.

Meanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] falls in love with Susie and attempts to win her heart by writing songs specifically for her. This culminates in making a detailed music video featuring Stewie singing a direct version of [[Bryan Adams]]' song "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]". In the end, however, he states he is over his crush and has an interest in Bryan Adams.
