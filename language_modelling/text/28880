'''Kenneth Horne''' (27 February 1907 <U+2013> 14 February 1969) was an [[England|English]] comedian and businessman. 

==Early life==
Born Charles Kenneth Horne,<ref>Barry Took, "Horne, (Charles) Kenneth (1907<U+2013>1969)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37568], accessed 17 April 2007</ref> he was the son of [[Charles Silvester Horne]] (1865-1914), a [[Congregationalist]] minister, [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]], and powerful orator who built the ''White House'' in Sandford Avenue,  [[Church Stretton]] as the family home, and is commemorated by the 'Silvester Horne Institute' in Church Stretton, [[Shropshire]]. His maternal grandfather was [[Baron Cozens-Hardy|Herbert Cozens-Hardy]], the Liberal MP for [[North Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North Norfolk]] who became both the [[Master of the Rolls]] and [[Baron Cozens-Hardy]] on 1 July 1914.
 
During [[World War II]], Horne served in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], reaching the rank of [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]]. As part of BBC Radio's support of the war effort, entertainment programmes were devised to target each wing of the armed forces, which led to Horne's involvement in ''Much-Binding-In-The-Marsh'', set initially at the titular fictitious [[Royal Air Force station]].

==Career==
Horne starred in the BBC radio programmes ''[[Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh]]'', with [[Richard Murdoch]] (1944-53), ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' (1958-64) and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' (1965-68), in the last two supported by [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Hugh Paddick]], [[Betty Marsden]] and [[Bill Pertwee]]. These four played a succession of grotesque characters revolving around the imperturbable establishment figure of Horne himself.

Horne was an excellent comedian as well as chairman of Triplex Glass (later merged into [[Pilkington]]) and [[Chad Valley|Chad Valley Toys]], until he gave up business in 1958 after a debilitating stroke and concentrated on comedy.

He was particularly close to [[Kenneth Williams]], who looked on him as a substitute father. He also did TV advertising and starred in the Thames TV series ''[[Horne A'plenty]]'' in 1968. In addition, he hosted a game show called ''Treasure Hunt'' - not to be confused with the later [[Kenneth Kendall]] / [[Anneka Rice]] show of the same name - on [[Westward Television]].

==Death==
Horne died from a massive heart attack on 14 February 1969, while hosting the annual Guild of Television Producers' and Directors' Awards at the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London. Presenting the awards was Earl Mountbatten of Burma; an award had just gone to Barry Took and Marty Feldman (writers of ''Round the Horne'') for their TV series ''Marty'', and Horne had just urged viewers to tune into the fifth series of ''Round the Horne'' (due to start on 16 March) when he fell from the podium. It was decided that ''Round the Horne'' could not continue without its star, so the scripts were hastily adapted into a new series called ''Stop Messing About'', which was widely judged a failure.

Horne was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]]. 

==Legacy==
Editions of ''Beyond Our Ken'' and ''Round the Horne'' are regularly broadcast on the digital radio service [[BBC 7]].

In October 2003 a successful stage show called ''Round the Horne ... Revisited'' opened in London, compiled by Series Four co-writer Brian Cooke from original scripts, and ran until April 2005 (also siring three nationwide tours). Horne was played by [[Jonathan Rigby]], who in 2008 reprised the role in a new show, devised this time by Lyn Took, called ''Round the Horne - Unseen and Uncut''.
