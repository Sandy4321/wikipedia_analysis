It is one of the sixteen [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] (along with the smaller [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] of [[Pateros]]) that comprise [[Metro Manila]].

Manila is located on the eastern shore of [[Manila Bay]] and is bordered by [[Navotas]] and [[Caloocan]] to the north; [[Quezon City]] to the northeast; [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Mandaluyong]] to the east; [[Makati]] to the southeast, and [[Pasay]] to the south.

Manila has a total population of 1,652,171 according to the 2010 census.<ref name="2010 census">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov.ph/data/sectordata/2010/2010CPH_ncr.pdf|title=2010 Census of Population and Housing: National Capital Region|publisher=National Statistics Office of the Republic of the Philippines|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref> Manila is the second most populous city in the Philippines, behind its neighbor, [[Quezon City]].

The city is divided into [[Legislative districts of Manila|six legislative districts]] and consists of sixteen geographical districts: [[Binondo, Manila|Binondo]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]], [[Intramuros]], [[Malate, Manila|Malate]], [[Paco, Manila|Paco]], [[Pandacan, Manila|Pandacan]], [[Port of Manila|Port Area]], [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]], [[San Andres, Manila|San Andres]], [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]], [[San Nicolas, Manila|San Nicolas]], [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[Santa Mesa, Manila|Santa Mesa]] and [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]].

Manila is also home to many scientific and educational institutions, numerous sport facilities, and other culturally and historically significant venues.

The earliest written account of the city is the 10th-century [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] which describes a context of an [[Greater India|Indianised]] [[Kingdom of Maynila|kingdom]] maintaining diplomatic relations with [[Medang Kingdom|the Kingdom of Medang]]. The city was invaded by Brunei's Sultan [[Bolkiah]] and was already Islamized by the 15th century when the Spanish first arrived. Manila eventually became the center of Spanish activity in the [[Far East]] and one end of the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade route inking [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]]. This caused it to be called the "Pearl of the Orient". Several Chinese insurrections, local revolts, a [[British Occupation of the Philippines|British Occupation]] and a [[Sepoy]] mutiny also occurred thereafter. Later, it saw the rise of the [[Philippine Revolution]] which was followed by the [[History of the Philippines (1898<U+2013>1946)|arrival of the Americans]] who made contributions to the city's urban planning and development only to have most of those improvements lost in the devastation of [[World War II]]. Since then the city has been rebuilt. <!-- As per [[WP:City Guidelines]]-->

==History==
{{Main|History of Manila}}
[[File:EscoltaManila1899.jpg|thumb|left|Escolta Street in [[Stereoscopy|stereoptical]] view, 1899.]]

Manila was first known as ''Gint<U+00F4>'' (gold) or ''Suvarnadvipa'' by neighbouring settlements, and was officially the [[Kingdom of Maynila]]. The Kingdom flourished during the latter half of the [[Ming Dynasty]] as a result of direct trade relations with China. [[Kingdom of Tondo|Ancient Tondo]] was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire, with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieftains, and were addressed variously as ''panginuan'' or ''panginoon'' ("lords"); ''anak banwa'' ("son of heaven"); or ''[[lakandula]]'' ("lord of the palace"). In the 13th century, the city consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the [[Pasig river]], on top of previous older towns. There is also early evidence of Manila being invaded by the Indianized empire of [[Majapahit]], due to the epic eulogy poem [[Nagarakretagama]] which inscribed its conquest by [[Maharaja]] [[Hayam Wuruk]].<ref name="ManilaHistoryJSTOR"/> Saludong or Selurong which is a historical name for the city of Manila is listed in Canto 14 alongside Sulot, which is now [[Sulu Province|Sulu]], and Kalka.<ref name="ManilaHistoryJSTOR">{{cite journal |last1=Gerini |first1=G.

During the reign of Sultan [[Bolkiah]] in 1485 to 1521, the [[Brunei|Sultanate of Brunei]] decided to break the [[Ancient Tondo|Dynasty of Tondo]]'s monopoly in the China trade by attacking it and establishing the state of Selurong (now Manila) as a Bruneian satellite-state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history-centre.gov.bn/sultanbrunei.htm |title=Pusat Sejarah Brunei |publisher=Government of Brunei Darussalam |language=Malay |accessdate=04-03-10}}</ref> A new dynasty under the Islamized Rajah Salalila. was also established to challenge the House of Lakandula in Tondo. Islam was further strengthened by the arrival to the Philippines of traders and [[proselytizer]]s from [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=22}}</ref> The multiple states that existed in the Philippines simplified [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|Spanish colonization]]. Manila was temporarily threatened by the invasion of Chinese pirate-warlord [[Limahong]] before it became the seat of the [[Colonialism|colonial]] government of [[Spain]].

In 1571 Spanish conquistador [[Miguel Lopez de Legazpi]] founded the Manila in what today is [[Intramuros]]. Manila was made the capital of the Philippine Islands, which Spain would control for over three centuries, from 1565 to 1898. [[British occupation of the Philippines|The city was occupied]] by [[Great Britain]] for two years from 1762 to 1764 as part of the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362270/Manila |title=Manila (Philippines) |publisher=[[Britannica]] |accessdate=24-04-10}}</ref> The city remained the capital of the Philippines under the government of the provisional British governor, acting through the Mexican-born Archbishop of Manila, [[Manuel Rojo del Rio y Vieyra]] and the captive [[Real Audiencia]].<ref name=tracy1995p58 /> However, armed resistance to the British persisted, centered in [[Pampanga]], and was led by Oidor Don Sim<U+00F3>n de Anda y Salazar.<ref name=tracy1995p58>{{Harvnb|Tracy|1995|p=58}}</ref>

[[File:BurnhamPlanOf-Manila.jpg|thumb|left|The Burnham Plan of Manila. North is at the left.]]
Manila also became famous during the Manila-[[Acapulco]] galleon trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from as far as Mexico and Peru all the way to [[Southeast Asia]]. Silver that was mined in [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]] were exchanged for Chinese silk, Indian gems, and the spices of the East Indies.

In 1898, [[Spain]] ceded the Philippines to the [[United States]]. Under American control, the new government invited [[Daniel Burnham]] to plan a modern Manila.<ref>Tiongson, Nicanor, Tuklas Sining, Sentrong Pangkultura ng Pilipinas, 1991</ref> The Burnham Plan was a project that attempted to create Manila as ''Paris on the Prairie'', with a vision of a government center occupying all of Wallace Field, which extends from Luneta to the present Taft Avenue. The Philippines Capitol was to rise on the Taft Avenue end of the field, facing toward the sea, and would form, with the buildings of different government bureaus and departments, a mighty quadrangle, lagoon in the center and a monument to Rizal at its Luneta end. Of Burnham<U+2019>s proposed government center, only three units were built: the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments, which were completed on the eve of the War. By then, [[President Manuel L. Quezon]] had doomed the Burnham Plan by creating a new capital outside Manila, which was named after him, [[Quezon City]].

Manila was the site of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|bloodiest battle]] in the [[Pacific theater]] during the war. After falling to the Japanese on January 2, 1942, it was recaptured by the joint American and Filipino troops in February to March 1945. Some [[Manila massacre|100,000 civilians were killed]] in Manila between November 1944 and February 1945.<ref>{{cite web | last =White | first =Matthew | title = Death Tolls for the Man-made Megadeaths of the 20th Century | url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Manila | accessdate = 2007-08-01}}</ref> It was the second most devastated city in the world after [[Warsaw]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Since then the city has been rebuilt.

The rebuilt of the general headquarters of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was active on March 1945 to June 1946 was relocating stationed in the capital city after the liberation and the Battle of Manila by the combined Filipino and American troops.

[[File:Manila Walled City Destruction May 1945.jpg|left|thumb|The destruction brought about by the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]]]]
With [[Arsenio Lacson]] becoming the first elected [[Mayor of Manila|mayor]] in 1952 (all mayors were appointed prior to this), the City of Manila underwent ''The Golden Age'',<ref name=RoseHistorianManila>{{Harvnb|Hancock|2000|p=16}}</ref> was revitalized, and once again became the "Pearl of the Orient", a moniker it earned before the outbreak of the war. After Mayor Lacson's term in the 1950s, the city was led by Mayor [[Antonio Villegas]] during most of the 1960s, and Mayor [[Ramon Bagatsing]] for nearly the entire decade of the 1970s until the 1986 Edsa revolution, making him the longest serving [[Mayor of Manila]]. Mayors Lacson, Villegas, and Bagatsing are oftentimes collectively considered as the "Big Three of Manila" for their rather long tenures as the City Hall's chief executive (continuously for over three decades, from 1952<U+2013>1986), but more importantly, for their indelible contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in uplifting the quality of life and welfare of the people of the City of Manila.

During the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] dictatorship, the region of the Manila Metropolitan area was enacted as an independent entity in 1975 encompassing several [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] and towns, being a separate local-regional unit and the [[seat of government]] of the Philippines.

In 1992, [[Alfredo Lim]] became the mayor, and was known for his anti-crime crusades. When Lim ran for the [[President of the Philippines|presidency]] during the [[Philippine presidential election, 1998|1998 presidential election]], his vice mayor [[Lito Atienza]] was elected as city mayor. Atienza was known for renovating most of the city's plaza, and projects that would benefit the populace. He was the Mayor of Manila for 3 terms (9 years); barred for seeking a fourth consecutive term. Lim defeated Atienza's son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of Atienza's projects<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/12/01/09/it%E2%80%99s-atienza-vs-lim-part-2-manila |title=It<U+2019>s Atienza vs. Lim Part 2 in Manila |first=Sheryl |last=Mundo |author=Sheryl Mundo |date=12-01-09 |month=December |year=2009 |work= |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] |location=Manila |accessdate=25-04-10 |quote=Environment Secretary Jose 'Lito' Atienza will get to tangle again with incumbent Manila Alfredo Lim in the coming 2010 elections.}}</ref> claiming the projects made little contribution to the improvements of the city. On July 17, 2008, councilor Dennis Alcoreza filed [[human rights]] complaints before the [[Commission on Human Rights]], against Lim, and other Manila officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/107511/Councilor-files-raps-vs-Lim-Manila-execs-before-CHR|title=Councilor files raps vs Lim, Manila execs before CHR |author=Amita Legaspi |first=Amita |last=Legaspi |publisher=[[GMA Network|GMA News]] |date=17-07-08 |accessdate=20-04-10 |quote= A Manila City councilor on Thursday filed human rights complaints against Mayor Alfredo Lim, other city officials and policemen over the violent takeover of the Dealco slaughterhouse in Vitas, Tondo last July 11.}}</ref> Twenty-four Manila officials also resigned because of the maltreatment of Lim's police forces.

While the eastern part of [[Metro Manila]] faced a catastrophe during the flooding of [[Typhoon Ketsana|Tropical Storm Ketsana]] (local name: Ondoy) in 2009, the only major inconvenience in the city was the flooded Quezon Boulevard underpass which took two days to clean up and the district of [[Santa Mesa, Manila|Santa Mesa]], the most flooded area within the city. During the [[Manila local elections, 2010|2010 city elections]], Alfredo Lim won against secretary Lito Atienza. After a few months of taking office, Lim was harshly criticized on the bloody resolution of the [[Manila hostage crisis]], one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Philippines.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Manila|Port of Manila}}
[[File:Manila Bay Landsat 2000.jpg|thumb|Landsat satellite [[false-color]] photo of [[Manila Bay]] and the [[Metro Manila|Metropolis of Manila]]]]
Manila is located on the eastern shores of [[Manila Bay|Manila bay]], which rests on the western shores of [[Luzon]]. The city lies {{convert|800|mi|km|abbr=off}} from mainland [[Asia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/asia/geography-of-manila.htm |title=Geography of Manila |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |accessdate=13-04-10}}</ref> The [[Pasig River]] bisects the city. Almost all of the city sits on top of centuries of prehistoric [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits built by the waters of the Pasig and on some land reclaimed from [[Manila Bay]]. The city's land has been altered substantially by human intervention, with considerable land reclamation along the waterfronts since the American colonial times. Some of the natural variations in topography have been evened out due to the urbanization of the city. The city occupies an area of 38.55 square kilometers and was divided into 897 [[barangay]]s, the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines. Each barangay has its own chairperson and councilors. For administrative convenience, all the barangays in Manila are grouped into 100 zones and which are further grouped into 16 geographical districts. These zones and districts have no form of local government. These 16 geographical districts are further grouped into the six [[legislative districts of Manila]].

===Climate===

Under the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] system, Manila features a [[tropical savanna climate]] that borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the [[equator]] means that the temperature range is very small, rarely going lower than 20&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] and going higher than 38&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. However, humidity levels are usually very high which makes it feel much warmer. It has a distinct, albeit relatively short [[dry season]] from January through April, and a relatively lengthy [[wet season]] from May through December.

==Sports==
[[File:Basketball in Intramuros.jpg|thumb|Children playing basketball at Intramuros]]

Sports in Manila have a long and distinguished history. The city's, and the country's in general, main sport is [[basketball]], and most barangays have a makeshift basketball court, with court markings drawn on the streets. Larger barangays have covered courts; this is where interbarangay leagues are held every summer (April<U+2013>May).

The city has several well-known sports venues, such as the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]] and San Andres Gym, the home of the now defunct [[Manila Metrostars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Manila-Sports.html |title=Manila: Sports |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium, the Baseball Stadium, Tennis Courts, Memorial Coliseum and the Ninoy Aquino Stadium (the latter two are indoor arenas).

The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the [[1954 Asian Games]] and the [[1934 Far Eastern Games]]. Whenever the country hosts the [[Southeast Asian Games]], most of the events are held at the complex, but on the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games|2005 Games]], most events were held elsewhere. The [[1960 ABC Championship]] and the [[1973 ABC Championship]], forerunners of the [[FIBA Asia Championship]], was hosted by the complex, with the [[Philippines men's national basketball team|national basketball team]] winning on both tournaments. The [[1978 FIBA World Championship]] was held at the complex although the latter stages were held in the [[Araneta Coliseum]] in [[Quezon City]], Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena.

Manila also hosts several well-known sports facilities such as the [[Enrique M. Razon Sports Center]] and the [[University of Santo Tomas Sports Complex]], both of which are private venues owned by a university; collegiate sports are also held, with the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] basketball games held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum and Ninoy Aquino Stadium, although basketball events had transferred to [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]'s [[Filoil Flying V Arena]] and the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. Other collegiate sports are still held at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex. Professional basketball also used to play at the city, but the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] now holds their games at Araneta Coliseum and [[Cuneta Astrodome]] at [[Pasay]]; the now defunct [[Philippine Basketball League]] played some of their games at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex.

Previously a widely-played sport in the city, Manila is now the home of the only sizable [[baseball]] stadium in the country, at the [[Rizal Memorial Baseball Stadium]]. The stadium hosts games of [[Baseball Philippines]]; [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Babe Ruth]] were the first players to score a [[home run]] at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2, 1934.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/158970 |title=Baseball loses no time in preparing for SEAG |first=Tito |last=Talao |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=2004-03-10 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>

Another popular sport in the city are [[cue sports]], and billiard halls are a feature in most barangays. The [[2010 World Cup of Pool]] was held at [[Robinsons Place Manila]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/09/07/10/world-cup-pool-begins |title=World Cup of Pool begins |work=ABS-CBNnews.com|date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref>

The [[Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium]] hosted the first [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifier in decades when the [[Philippines national football team|Philippines]] hosted [[Sri Lanka national basketball team|Sri Lanka]] in July 2011. The stadium, which was previously unfit for international matches, had undergone a major renovation program prior to the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/6646/all-systems-go-for-azkals-world-cup-qualifier-at-rizal-memorial |title=All systems go for Azkals' World Cup qualifier at Rizal Memorial |first=Ryan |last=Fenix |work=Interaksyon.com |date=2011-06-04 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}</ref> The Football Stadium now regularly hosts matches of the [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]].

Data presented by the <!-- http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/p143900.html --> [[National Statistics Office (Philippines)|National Statistics Office]] still do not reflect the 16-district configuration recognized by the city government of Manila. It recognizes neither the western area of Santa Ana that now belongs to the fifth congressional district of Manila as the geographical district of San Andres Bukid, nor the area of Sampaloc south of the Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard which now belongs to the sixth congressional district as the geographical district of Santa Mesa.

[[File:Ph map manila.svg|thumb|Map of Manila with landmarks highlighted]]
Aside from the division of the sixteen geographical districts, the city is also divided into the six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city's representatives to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|lower house]] of the [[Congress of the Philippines]] and of the regular members to the ''[[Sangguniang Panlungsod]]'' (SP; City Council). Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and six SP members to the council. The city, along with the rest of the nation, elects 12 [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] as one [[at-large]] district.

* The '''[[Legislative districts of Manila#1st District|1st District]]''' (2007 population: 407,331) is Manila's (and the country's) most densely populated congressional district. It covers the western portion of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] that lies along [[Manila Bay]].

The City Seal depicts the words ''Lungsod ng Maynila'' and ''Pilipinas'', [[Filipino language|Filipino]] for ''City of Manila'' and ''Philippines'', in a circle around a shield. The circle also contains six yellow stars representing the city's six congressional districts. The city seal composes of the shield, in the shape of pre-colonial people's shield, depicts the city's nickname ''Pearl of the Orient'' on top, a sea lion in the middle, in reference to the city's Spanish influences, and the waves of the Pasig river and Manila bay in the bottom. The colors of the seal mirror that of the [[flag of the Philippines]]. The sea lion in the seal of Manila was adopted by [[Singapore]] into its merlion.

===National government===
[[File:Malacanang palace view.jpg|thumb|The fa<U+00E7>ade of [[Malaca<U+00F1>ang Palace]], the official residence of the [[President of the Philippines]].]]
Manila, being the seat of political power of the Philippines, has several national government offices headquartered at the city. Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of [[History of the Philippines (1898<U+2013>1946)|American colonization to the country]] when they envisioned a well-designed city outside the walls of Intramuros. The strategic location chosen was Bagumbayan, a former town which is now the [[Rizal Park]] to become the center of government and a design commission was given to [[Daniel Burnham]] to create a master plan for the city patterned after [[Washington D.C.]]. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. Quezon. A new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now [[Quezon City]]. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still resides in Manila. However, many of the plans were substantially altered after the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|devastation of Manila]] during [[World War II]] and the subsequent administrations.

The city, as the capital, still hosts the [[President of the Philippines|Office of the President]], as well as the president's official residence. Aside from these, important institutions such as the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] (''Kataas-taasang hukuman''), the [[Philippine Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]], the [[Executive Departments of the Philippines|Departments]] of [[Department of Budget and Management (Philippines)|Budget and Management]] (''Kagawaran ng Pagbabadyet at Pamamahala''), [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Finance]], [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Health]], [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Justice]], [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Labor and Employment]], and [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Tourism]] still call the city home. Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital.

Congress previously held office at the [[Old Congress Building, Manila|Old Congress Building]]. In 1972, due to declaration of martial law, Congress was dissolved; its successor, the [[unicameral]] [[Batasang Pambansa]], held office at the new [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. When a new [[constitution of the Philippines|constitution]] restored the [[bicameral]] Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it currently shares with the [[Government Service Insurance System]] at reclaimed land at [[Pasay]].

The center of education since the colonial period, Manila, particularly Intramuros, is the home of several of the oldest schools. It currently contains the majority of the Philippine's colleges and universities. It served as the home of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (1611), [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] (1620), and [[Ateneo de Manila University]] (1859). Only [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] (1620) is left at Intramuros; the [[University of Santo Tomas]] transferred to a new campus at [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]] in 1927, and Ateneo left Intramuros for Loyola Heights, [[Quezon City]] (while still retaining "de Manila" in its name) in 1952. The [[University of the City of Manila]] located at Intramuros, and [[Universidad De Manila]] located outside the walled city, are both owned and operated by the Manila city government. The national government controls the [[University of the Philippines Manila]], the oldest of the [[University of the Philippines]] constituent universities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The city is also the site of the [[Polytechnic University of the Philippines]], the largest university in the country in terms of student population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pup.edu.ph/profile/ |title=PUP: Profile |first= |last= |author= |date=30-03-11 |month=March |year=2011 |publisher=Polytechnic University of the Philippines |accessdate=30-03-11|ref=PUP Website |quote=}}</ref>

Intramuros and Sampaloc are now a part of the [[University Belt]], the colloquial term for the high concentration of institutions of higher education in the city, which also includes of [[San Miguel, Manila|San Miguel]] and [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]] located in the northern bank of the Pasig River, and the districts of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] on its southern bank.

Manila, being a major city, has various transportation options, the most famous being the [[jeepney]], which has been in use since the years immediately following World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/philippines/pro-transportation.htm |title=Transportation in the Philippines |publisher=AsianInfo.org |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |ref=Information provided in part by the Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref> In more recent years, air-conditioned [[Toyota Kijang|Tamaraw FX]], the third generation [[Toyota Kijang]] was often used for the service, which have begun to compete with jeepneys. Along with buses, jeepneys and FX ply fixed routes for a set price, though each mode has different routes.

On a for-hire basis, the city is served by numerous [[taxicab]]s, "tricycles" (motorcycles with sidecars, the Philippine version of the [[auto rickshaw]]), and "trisikads" or "sikads" (bicycles with a sidecars, the Philippine version of [[pedicabs]]). In some areas, especially in Divisoria, two stroke motors are fitted to the pedicabs and are used to transport goods. Spanish-era horse-drawn [[calesa]]s are still used in the streets of [[Binondo]] and [[Intramuros]], but mostly for tourists. Which mode of for-hire used depends upon the distance to be traveled, the cost, and the width of the streets. All types of public transport are privately owned and operated under government franchise.

The city is serviced by the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System]], popularly known as LRT, as distinct from the MRT in other parts of Metro Manila. Development of the railway system began in the 1970s under the Marcos administration, making it the first light rail transport in [[Southeast Asia]]. In recent years, the system has undergone a multi-billion dollar expansion.<ref name="10points">{{cite web |author=Republic of the Philippines.

In 2006 Forbes ranked Manila <U+201C>the world<U+2019>s most congested city<U+201D>. Manila has become notorious for its frequent traffic jams and heavily crowded metro. Infrastructure planning has faces a series of drawbacks, such as [[corruption]], disorganised polity and poor public transport.<ref>[http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220429/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation]</ref>
