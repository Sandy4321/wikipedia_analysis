*********************** -->

'''Howard Staunton''' (1810&nbsp;<U+2013> 22 June 1874) was an English [[chess master]] who is generally regarded as having been the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851, largely as a result of his 1843 victory over [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]]. He promoted a [[chess]] set of clearly distinguishable [[Chess piece|pieces]] of standardised shape<U+2014>the [[Staunton chess set|Staunton pattern]] promulgated by [[Nathaniel Cook]]<U+2014>that is still the style required for competitions. He was the principal organiser of the [[London 1851 chess tournament|first international chess tournament]] in 1851, which made [[England]] the world's leading chess centre and caused [[Adolf Anderssen]] to be recognised as the [[World Chess Championship|world's strongest player]].

From 1840 onwards he became a leading chess commentator, and won matches against top players of the 1840s. In 1847 he entered a parallel career as a [[Shakespeare]]an scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between Staunton and [[Paul Morphy|Morphy]], but they failed. It is often alleged that Staunton deliberately misled Morphy while trying to avoid the match, but it is also possible Staunton overestimated his chances of getting physically fit and of making time available for a match.

Modern commentators consider Staunton's understanding of [[Glossary of chess#Positional play|positional play]] to have been far ahead of his contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his ''Chess-Player's Handbook'' (1847) was a reference for decades. The [[chess opening]]s the [[English Opening]] and [[Staunton Gambit]] were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.

==Life==
[[Image:HowardStaunton.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Staunton, c. 1860]]
Most information about Staunton's early life is based on claims he made. Record of his birth or baptism has never been found. The chess historian [[Harold James Ruthven Murray|H.J.R. Murray]] summarized the information that he "[[glean]]ed" from various sources: Staunton was born in 1810, reputedly the [[Legitimacy (law)|natural son]] of [[Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle|Frederick Howard, fifth Earl of Carlisle]]; he was neglected in youth, receiving little or no education; although he spent some time in Oxford, he was never a member of the University; when he came of age he inherited a few thousand pounds, which he soon squandered; in later life Staunton often used to tell how he had once played Lorenzo in the ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'', with the famous English actor [[Edmund Kean]] playing Shylock.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/><ref name="WinterChessNote4776">{{cite web

===1836<U+2013>42, first steps in chess===
In 1836 Staunton came to [[London]], where he took out a subscription for William Greenwood Walker's ''Games at Chess, actually played in London, by the late [[Alexander McDonnell]] Esq.'' Staunton was apparently twenty-six when he took a serious interest in chess. He said that at that time the strongest players he saw in London, [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]] and [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]], could easily have given him [[Chess handicap|rook odds]].<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/> In 1838 he played many games with [[William Davies Evans|Captain Evans]], inventor of the [[Evans Gambit]], and also lost a match against the German chess writer [[Aaron Alexandre]]. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H.W. Popert,<ref name="ScoresRomanticEra"/> a slow, cautious player with great defensive skill.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/>

From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a chess column for the ''New Court Gazette''. He then became chess editor of the magazine ''British Miscellany'', and his chess column developed into a separate magazine, the ''[[Chess Player's Chronicle]]'', which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton">{{cite journal

Early in 1843 Staunton prevailed in a long series of games against [[John Cochrane (chess player)|John Cochrane]], a strong player and [[chess theoretician]].<ref name="ScoresRomanticEra"/> [[Chessmetrics]] treats these games incorrectly as one match when it was in fact a series of matches, and lists it as Staunton's best performance.<ref name="chessmetricsProfileStaunton">{{cite web

A little later that year he lost a short match (2<U+00BD>-3<U+00BD>) in London against the visiting French player [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]], who was generally regarded as the world's strongest active player.<ref name="storiascacchiMatchesTo1849"/><ref name="Fine1952WorldsGreatChessGames">Fine 1951</ref>

[[Image:Howard Staunton Chess Handbook.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''The Chess-Player's Handbook'']]
The first chess match by [[Electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] took place in 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and [[Hugh Alexander Kennedy|Captain Kennedy]] traveled to [[Gosport]] to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in the ''Illustrated London News''. In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between [[Sydney]] and [[Adelaide]] calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had traveled a total of 220,000&nbsp;miles (not much less than the distance between [[Earth]] and [[Moon]]).<ref name="HilbertStauntonChessByTelegraph"/>

In 1847 Staunton published his most famous work, ''The Chess-Player's Handbook'', which is still in print.<ref>{{cite web

If, however, there are two Knights and one Bishop opposed to a Rook, the latter may generally be [[Exchange (chess)|exchanged]] for the Bishop, and as two Knights are insufficient of themselves to force checkmate, the game will be drawn."

He still found time for two matches in 1846, comfortably beating the professionals [[Bernhard Horwitz]] (fourteen wins, three draws, and seven losses) and [[Daniel Harrwitz]]. The match against Harrwitz was set up in a very unusual way: seven games in which Staunton gave Harrwitz [[chess handicap|odds]] of pawn and two moves (Staunton won four and lost three), seven games where he gave pawn and move (Staunton lost six and won one), and seven at no odds (Staunton won all seven).<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/><ref name="ScoresRomanticEra"/><ref name="chessOdds">A stronger player sometimes gives a weaker player an [[chess handicap|advantage]]. In "pawn odds" the stronger player starts without one of his pawns and plays as White (or, if there is a match at odds, the players alternate colors in the normal way), while at "pawn and move odds" (abbreviated P+1) the stronger player always has the black pieces. If the gap in skill is greater the stronger player might give "pawn and two moves" (P+2), where he starts without one of his pawns, plays as Black ''and'' lets his opponent have a further extra move. If the difference in skill is even greater, the stronger player may give knight, bishop or even rook odds (removing the relevant piece before the game starts).</ref>

The tournament was a success, but disappointing for Staunton personally; in the second round he was [[Single-elimination tournament|knocked out]] by Anderssen, who won the tournament convincingly; and in the [[play-off]] for third place Staunton was narrowly beaten by [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]].<ref name="WeeksLondon1851">{{cite web | url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/v1lon-ix.htm | title=1851 London Tournament | accessdate=2008-06-19 }}</ref><ref>Williams beat Staunton by one game in the match.

The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organised a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in Staunton's tournament), and the result was the same - Anderssen won.<ref name="storiascacchiTorneiAl1879" />

In 1852 Staunton published his book ''The Chess Tournament'', which recounted in detail the efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play.<ref name="StauntonLondon1851" /> Unfortunately some of Staunton's comments in the book and in the ''Illustrated London News'' were intemperate, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton" />

===1852<U+2013>60, final stages of playing career and Shakespeare publication===
Immediately after the London International tournament Staunton challenged [[Adolf Anderssen|Anderssen]] to a match of twenty-one games, for <U+00A3>100. Anderssen accepted the challenge but the match could not be arranged: Staunton was physically unfit for an immediate contest, and Anderssen had to return to work.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/>

[[Carl Jaenisch]] had arrived too late for the tournament; Staunton convincingly won a match with him soon after (seven wins, one draw, and two losses).<ref name="Matches1850To1864"/> Later in 1851 Staunton played a match against [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]], who had won their play-off for third place in the London International tournament. Staunton won more games (six wins, three draws, and four losses) but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start.<ref name="ScoresRomanticEra"/>

In 1853, while trying to arrange a match against Anderssen, Staunton met [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa]] in Brussels. The two began a match, but had to abandon it in the middle of the thirteenth game, with von der Lasa leading (five wins, four losses, and three draws). Staunton was unfit to continue because of heart [[palpitations]], which had affected him in the second match against [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]] in 1843. In von der Lasa's opinion there was no chance that Staunton's health would be good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards.<ref name="vdLasa1874Staunton">{{cite journal

In the mid-1850s Staunton obtained a contract with the publishers [[Routledge]] to edit the text of [[Shakespeare]]. This [[The Globe Illustrated Shakespeare: The Complete Works Annotated|edition]] appeared in parts from 1857 to 1860, and Staunton's work was praised by experts.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/>

[[Image:PaulmorphyHair.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Paul Morphy]]]]
While Staunton was busy with the Shakespeare edition, he received a courteous letter from the [[New Orleans]] Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play [[Paul Morphy]], who had won the recent [[American_Chess_Congress#First_American_Chess_Congress|First American Chess Congress]]. Staunton replied, thanking the New Orleans Chess Club and Morphy "for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion" and pointing out that he had not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and that he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' that he had "been compelled, by laborious literary occupation, to abandon the practice of chess, beyond the indulgence of an occasional game...&nbsp;If Mr. Morphy<U+2014>for whose skill we entertain the liveliest admiration<U+2014>be desirous to win his spurs among the chess chivalry of Europe, he must take advantage of his purposed visit next year; he will then meet in this country, in France, in Germany and in Russia, many champions&nbsp;... ready to test and do honor to his prowess."<ref>The full text of Staunton's letter was:"Gentlemen:<br />In reply to your very courteous proposal for me to visit New Orleans for the purpose of encountering Mr. Paul Morphy at Chess, permit me to mention that for many years professional duties have compelled me to abandon the practice of the game almost entirely except in the most desultory manner, and at the present time these duties are so exacting that it is with difficulty I am enabled to snatch one day out of seven for exercise and relaxation.<br />Under the circumstances you will at once perceive that a long and arduous chess contest, even in this Metropolis, would be an enterprise too formidable for me to embark in without ample opportunity for the recovery of my old strength in play, together with such arrangements as would prevent the sacrifice of my professional engagements for the sake of a match at chess, and that the idea of undertaking one in a foreign country, many thousand miles from here, is admissible only in a dream.<br />With friendly greetings to my proposed antagonist, whose talent and enthusiasm no one can more highly estimate, and with compliments to you for the honor implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion, I beg to subscribe myself, with every consideration.<br />Yours obediently,<br />H.

Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]], the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in the ''Illustrated London News'', and demanding "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place."<ref name="batgirlPaulWaitsForAnderssen" /> Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.<ref name="batgirlPaulWaitsForAnderssen" /><!-- Lyttleton quoted at Talk:Paul Morphy
The main criticism against Staunton was never his failure to play Morphy. As Lord Lyttleton put it:

"In the general circumstances of the case, I conceive that Mr. Staunton was quite justified in declining the match."

His further statements explain Staunton's failings: "...I cannot but think, that in all fairness and considerate-ness, Mr. Staunton might have told you of this long before he did. I know no reason why he might not have ascertained it, and informed you of it in answer to your first letter from America. Instead of this, it seems to me plain, both as to the interview at which I myself was present, and as to all the other communications which have passed, that Mr. Staunton gave you every reason to suppose that he would be ready to play the match within no long time...." -->

===Later life===
Staunton continued writing the chess column in ''Illustrated London News'' until his death in 1874, greeting new developments with enthusiasm.<ref name="batgirlStaunton"/><ref name="HilbertStauntonChessByTelegraph"/> In 1860 he published ''Chess Praxis'', a supplement to his 1847 work ''The Chess Player's Handbook''. The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy's games and praised the American's play.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/><ref name="WallStaunton"/> Five years later Staunton published ''Great Schools of England'' (1865), whose main subject was the history of major English [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] but which also presented some progressive ideas: learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged; [[corporal punishment]] is to be avoided and [[fagging]] should be abolished.<ref>{{cite book

==Assessment==
Staunton has been a controversial figure ever since his own time. In the words of chess journalist Mark Weeks, "Staunton represents a unique challenge to chess history. Many players immediately associate his name with Paul Morphy, as in 'Staunton ducked a match with Morphy'.&nbsp;... This is extremely unfair, as it concentrates the focus on Staunton to a relatively minor, factually controversial incident, while it ignores his significant achievements."<ref name="WeeksChessHistory2000n23">{{cite web

They just can't seem to accept that Staunton was an unmitigated bastard in his treatment of Morphy because he knew damned well he could never have made any decent showing against him in a match." However, Frederick Edge (1830<U+2013>82) and [[Philip W. Sergeant]] (1872<U+2013>1952), two of Staunton's harshest critics, were British, while former world champion [[Bobby Fischer]] (1943<U+2013>2008), one of the biggest fans of both Staunton and Morphy, was American.<ref>Fischer in a famous 1964 article listed Morphy and Staunton as two of the ten greatest players in history.

H.J.R. Murray wrote that Staunton's response to Morphy's initial challenge and his article about the same in the ''Illustrated London News'' should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/> Murray also commented on the whole affair, "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/> In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.<ref name="batgirlPaulWaitsForAnderssen" /> [[von der Lasa]] later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that he thought there was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards.<ref name="vdLasa1874Staunton" /> [[William Norwood Potter]] wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the ''City of London Chess Magazine'', "...&nbsp;nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means of getting out of an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, all said and done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one."<ref name="Potter1874Staunton">{{cite journal

Some 20th-century commentators have been more critical of Staunton. However some well-known chess writers, including [[Fred Reinfeld]], [[Israel Albert Horowitz|Israel "Al" Horowitz]] and [[Reuben Fine]], have been criticized by chess historians for their lack of accuracy, both in general and specifically where Staunton is concerned.<ref name="DiggleOnEdgeSergeantStainton">{{cite web

There is a famous story that [[Paul Morphy]] described Staunton as the author of "some devilish bad games". Chess historian [[Edward Winter (chess historian)|Edward Winter]] traced this back to a book published in 1902, whose author said he had seen a copy of Staunton's ''The Chess Tournament'' in which Morphy had written "some devilish bad games" on the title page; Winter was unable to trace the copy.<ref>{{cite web

From the early 1840s to 1851 Staunton could successfully give [[chess handicap|odds]] to almost any [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based player, including eventually [[John Cochrane (chess player)|John Cochrane]];<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/><ref name="chessOdds"/> the exceptions were [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], to whom Staunton gave [[List of chess terms#Pawn and move|pawn and move]] in 1843 and lost their match (six losses, no draws, one win), and [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]] in 1851, against whom Staunton won more games but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start.<ref name="ScoresRomanticEra"/> According to match records collected by Jeremy P. Spinrad, the only players who were successful against Staunton without receiving odds from 1840 to 1852 were: [[Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant|Saint-Amant]], who won their first match in London in 1843 and lost their second, longer match in Paris the same year; [[Adolf Anderssen]], who eliminated Staunton from the [[London 1851 chess tournament|1851 London International tournament]]; and [[Elijah Williams (chess player)|Elijah Williams]], who beat Staunton in the play-off for third place in the same tournament.<ref name="ScoresRomanticEra" /> Before 1840 Staunton was still a relative beginner, and after 1851 his health was too fragile for serious competition. In the late 1840s some UK commentators wrote that Buckle was stronger, and [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa]] was regarded by some as the world's best.<ref name="Spinrad2006EarlyWorldRankings"/> Staunton did not play von der Lasa until 1853, and was forced by ill-health to abandon the match.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/>

In his own time Staunton was regarded as belonging to the "closed" category of chess players (along with for example [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]] and [[J<U+00F3>zsef Sz<U+00E9>n]]) rather than to the "heroic" category (which included [[Louis-Charles Mah<U+00E9> de La Bourdonnais|La Bourdonnais]], Morphy and Anderssen)<U+2014>instead of seeking immediate combat, Staunton deferred it until he was ready.<ref name="Spinrad2006Bledow">{{cite web

On the other hand Staunton's often-criticized description of Anderssen as Germany's second best player, after Anderssen had won the 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable on the basis of what is now known about [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa's]] skill.<ref name="Spinrad2006EarlyWorldRankings"/> Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: a large percentage of his 1860 book ''Chess Praxis'' was devoted to Morphy's games, which he praised highly;<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/> and in ''The Chess-Player's Companion'' (1849) Staunton sometimes criticized his own play, and presented a few of his losses.<ref name="StauntonChessplayersCompanion"/>

Staunton showed excellent management skills in building the team to organize the London International tournament of 1851, and determination and resourcefulness in overcoming the difficulties of getting enough competitors.<ref name="Murray1908Staunton"/><ref name="batgirlAnderssen"/> He also maintained good working relationships with important players and enthusiasts, for example: Popert and [[John Cochrane (chess player)|Cochrane]] helped him to prepare for his second match against Saint-Amant; [[William Davies Evans|Captain Evans]] agreed to be one of his seconds in that match and later helped Staunton to organize the 1845 telegraphic match;<ref name="batgirlStaunton"/> the Calcutta Chess Club contributed <U+00A3>100 to help finance the London International Tournament in 1851, and in addition its principal officers Cochrane and T.C.

Although he introduced the [[English Opening]], it has been called "really a twentieth-century invention" that only became fully respectable after future World Champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] began playing it in the 1930s.<ref name="MCO-15_page675">{{cite book

<!-- Old content, KEEP until mined out ***************
In 1852 Staunton wrote a book about London 1851 titled, ''The Chess Tournament.'' The title page to that book read, "By H. Staunton, Esq., author of The Handbook of Chess, Chess-players Companion, &c.&c.&c" to which in 1853 a fifteen or sixteen-year-old lad named [[Paul Morphy]] scribbled in his copy, "and some devilish bad games". If Staunton was famous for his achievement as the best chess player in the world during the period 1843<U+2013>51, then after 1851 to his last days in 1874, he was most famous for his contribution in making England the capital of the chess world. In 1874 Morphy was more polite, and gave his estimate that Staunton's best gift was not in playing chess, but as a theoretician and analyst. In some ways Staunton's style presaged more modern methods; the English opening (1. c4) was so named because he often used it in the period 1840-50.

The American World Champion [[Robert Fischer]], writing on Staunton more than a century later, had a similar opinion. "Playing over his games", Fischer said, "I find they are completely modern." So Staunton was actually well ahead of his time, playing in a style which would become known as the [[Hypermodern]] in the 1920s.

Birmingham 1858 was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. Staunton refused to play [[Paul Morphy]] in public during the latter's visit to England in 1858, saying he was too busy working on his Shakespeare annotations. By 1860 his edition of Shakespeare had been published. Staunton considered it a great work, but modern day critics do not agree, and Staunton is an obscure name in modern Shakespearean scholarship. Staunton also published a book in 1860 titled ''Chess Praxis'', which to take advantage of the public's desire for Morphy material had over 168 pages of the American's games annotated by Staunton.

==Notable games==
*{{cite web

 | title=John Cochrane vs Howard Staunton, match London 1841
}} Staunton calmly focuses on his [[queenside]] attack and then shows that his opponent's [[kingside]] attack simply exposed the white king.
*{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1271878
 | title=John Cochrane vs Howard Staunton, match London 1842
}} Cochrane starts an apparently threatening attack while behind in development; Staunton [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] a piece for a counterattack that leads to a decisive [[list of chess terms#Material|material]] advantage.
*{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001193
 | title=Howard Staunton vs Pierre de Saint Amant, match Paris 1843
}} Staunton develops faster, weakens his opponent's K-side, creates threats on the queenside and then launches a [[checkmate|mating]] attack.
*{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001196
 | title=Pierre de Saint Amant vs Howard Staunton, match Paris 1843
}} Staunton develops his pieces more effectively in a closed position. When Saint Amant mistakenly opens the position, Staunton produces a [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrificial]] [[combination (chess)|combination]] that gives him an easily won endgame.
*{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001396
 | title=Staunton-Horwitz, match, London 1851, game 7 - English Opening
}} Staunton uses a modern-looking formation in the [[English Opening]], with both Bishops [[fianchetto]]ed; gains superior space and mobility; weakens his opponent's queenside and then kingside; and wins by a brisk attack.
*{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1271965
 | title=Adolf Anderssen et al. vs Howard Staunton et al., 1857, in Manchester
}} Staunton`s team adopts a [[Hippopotamus Defence|Hippopotamus]] formation, opens the center to start a queenside attack, and uses a couple of small sacrificial combinations to halt Anderssen's kingside attack and gain a decisive material advantage.
