'''Sangam literature''' refers to a body of classical [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Tamil literature|literature]] created between the years c. 300 BCE to 300 CE.<ref>There are some who claim earlier dates (up to 600 BCE). Others cite as late as 200 BCE.  The date of 300 BCE may represent a middle-of-the road consensus view; e.g. see the well-received textbook, Ancient India,  [[Upinder Singh]], 2009, p.15.   However, it is quite likely that the songs existed in oral tradition well before this date.</ref><ref>Kamil Veith Zvelebil, ''Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature'', p.12</ref><ref>K.A.

The rest of the corpus of Sangam literature deals with human relationship and emotions. See K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, ''A History of South India, OUP (1955) pp.330<U+2013>335</ref>

The poems belonging to the Sangam literature were composed by Tamil poets, both men and women, from various professions and classes of society. These poems were later collected into various anthologies, edited, and with [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s added by anthologists and annotators around 1000 AD. Sangam literature fell out of popular memory soon thereafter, until they were rediscovered in the 19th century by scholars such as [[Arumuga Navalar]], [[C. W. Thamotharampillai]] and [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]].

== Sangam literature ==
Sangam literature deals with  emotional and material topics such as  love, war, governance, trade and bereavement.<ref>Chera, Chola, Pandya: Using Archaeological Evidence to Identify the Tamil Kingdoms of Early Historic South India <U+2013> Abraham, Shinu Anna, Asian Perspectives <U+2013> Volume 42, Number 2, Fall 2003, pp. 207<U+2013>223 University of Hawaii Press</ref>
Much of the Tamil literature believed to have been composed in the Sangam period is lost to us, though detailed lists of works known to the 10th century compilers have survived.

The Indologist [[Kamil Zvelebil]] quotes A.K.Ramanujan: "In their antiquity and in their contemporaneity, there is not much else in any Indian literature equal to these quiet and dramatic Tamil poems. In their values and stances, they represent a mature classical poetry: passion is balanced by courtesy, transparency by ironies and nuances of design, impersonality by vivid detail, austerity of line by richness of implication.  These poems are not just the earliest evidence of the Tamil genius. The Tamils, in all their 2000 years of literary effort, wrote nothing better."<ref>Zvelebil, Kamil V., Tamil Literature, 1975, E J Brill, Leiden, p 108</ref><ref>Ramanujan, A.K., Interior Landscape, 1967, Afterword, p115.</ref>

== Compilation of literature ==
The available literature from this period was categorized and compiled in the 10th century into two categories based roughly on chronology.

== Classification ==
Sangam Poems falls into two categories: the 'inner field' (''Agam''{{spaced ndash}}<U+0B85><U+0B95><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>), and the 'outer field'(''Puram''{{spaced ndash}}<U+0BAA><U+0BC1><U+0BB1><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>) as described even in the first available Tamil [[grammar]], the ''[[Tolkappiyam]]''. 

The 'inner field' topics refer to personal or human aspects, such as love and [[sexual relationship]]s, and are dealt with in a metaphorical and abstract manner. The 'outer field' topics discuss all other aspects of human experience such as [[heroism]], [[valour]], [[ethics]], benevolence, [[philanthropy]], social life, and customs.

The division into ''agam'' and ''puram'' is not rigid, but depends upon the interpretation used in a specific context.

== Environmental classifications ==
{{Main| Sangam landscape}}
Sangam literature illustrates the thematic classification scheme first described in the ''[[Tolkappiyam]]''. The classification ties the emotions involved in agam poetry to a specific landscape. These landscapes are called ''thinai'' (<U+0BA4><U+0BBF><U+0BA3><U+0BC8>). These are: ''kurinji'' (<U+0B95><U+0BC1><U+0BB1><U+0BBF><U+0B9E><U+0BCD><U+0B9A><U+0BBF>), mountainous regions; ''mullai'' (<U+0BAE><U+0BC1><U+0BB2><U+0BCD><U+0BB2><U+0BC8>), forests; ''marutham'' (<U+0BAE><U+0BB0><U+0BC1><U+0BA4><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>), agricultural land; ''neithal'' (<U+0BA8><U+0BC6><U+0BAF><U+0BCD><U+0BA4><U+0BB2><U+0BCD>) coastal regions; ''paalai'' (<U+0BAA><U+0BBE><U+0BB2><U+0BC8>) deserts. In addition to the landscape based ''thinais'', ''kaikkiLai'' and ''perunthinai'' are used for unsolicited love and unsuited love respectively.

Similar ''thinais'' pertain to ''puram'' poems as well, though these categories are based on activity rather than landscape: ''vetchi'', 'karanthai'', ''vanchi'', ''kanchi'', ''uzhignai'', ''nochchi'', ''thumbai'', 'vaagai'', ''paataan'', and ''pothuviyal''.

==Tamil Sangams ==
{{Main|Tamil Sangams}}

According to the compilers of the Sangam works such as Nakkeeran, the Tamil Sangams were academies, where Tamil poets and authors are said to have gathered periodically to publish their works. The legends claim that the [[Pandya kingdom|Pandya]] rulers of the mythical cities of 'South' Madurai, Kapatapuram and Madurai to have patronized the three Sangams. The word "Sangam" is probably of [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] origin (and was not used anywhere in the Sangam literature itself), coming from "''Sangha''", the [[Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] term for an assembly of monks.

While these claims of the Sangams and the description of sunken land masses [[Kumari Kandam]] have been dismissed as frivolous by historiographers,<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/br/2005/08/16/stories/2005081600681500.htm The Hindu : Book Review : Resurrecting Lemuria<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> "Sangam literature" is still the preferred term for referring to the collection of Tamil works from the period 200 BC to 200 AD.  Noted historians like Kamil Zvelebil have stressed that the use of 'Sangam literature' to describe this corpus of literature is a misnomer and ''Classical'' literature should be used instead.<ref>Kamil Zvelebil., The Smile of Murugan</ref>{{Update after|2010|11|16}}

== Rediscovery ==

The works of Sangam literature were lost and forgotten for several centuries before they were brought to light by several Tamil Scholars such as [[Arumuga Navalar]], [[S. V. Damodaram Pillai]] and [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]].<ref>[http://www.chennaionline.com/cityfeature/manu.asp A library of palmyra manuscripts<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref><ref>"Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature", Kamil V. Zvelebil</ref>  They painstakingly collected and catalogued numerous manuscripts in various stages of deterioration. Navalar and Pillai hailed from [[Jaffna]]. Navalar brought to print for the first time any Sangam text; this was the ''Thirumurukaattuppadai'' of ''Pattupattu'' (one of The Ten Idylls), in 1851. Pillai brought the first of the Eight Anthologies (Edduththokai) of the Sangam classics the ''Kaliththokai'', in 1887. Swaminathaiyar brought his first print of ''Pattupattu'' in 1889. Together, these scholars printed and published ''[[Tholkappiyam]]'', ''Nachinarkiniyar urai'' (1895), ''Tholkappiyam Senavariyar urai'', (1868), ''[[Manimekalai]]'' (1898), ''[[Cilappatikaram]]'' (1889), ''[[Pattupattu]]'' (1889), and ''[[Purananuru]]'' (1894), all with scholarly commentaries. They published more than 100 works in all, including minor poems. J V Chellaiah of [[Jaffna College]] did the entire translation of ''Pattupattu'' in English in 1945.
