The Earth's human population is divided among [[List of sovereign states|about two hundred]] [[sovereign state|independent state]]s that interact through diplomacy, conflict, travel, trade, and [[Media (communication)|media]].

According to evidence from sources such as [[radiometric dating]], the Earth was formed [[Age of the Earth|around four and a half billion years]] ago. Within its first billion years,<ref name="age_earth1"/> [[Abiogenesis|life appeared]] in its oceans and began to affect [[Atmosphere of Earth|its atmosphere]] and surface, promoting the proliferation of [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] as well as [[anaerobic organism]]s and causing the formation of the atmosphere's [[ozone layer]]. This layer and the [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic field]] block the most life-threatening parts of the [[Sunlight|Sun's radiation]], so life was able to flourish on land as well as in water.<ref name="Harrison 2002"/> Since then, the combination of the Earth's [[Circumstellar habitable zone|distance from the Sun]],  [[Geophysics|its physical properties]], and [[Geological history of Earth|its geological history]] have allowed life to persist.

The Earth's [[lithosphere]] is divided into several rigid segments, or [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], that migrate across the surface over periods of [[Geologic time scale|many millions of years]].  71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered with water,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/ocean.html |title=NOAA&nbsp;<U+2013> Ocean |publisher=Noaa.gov |accessdate=2013-05-03}}</ref> with the remainder consisting of continents and islands that together have many lakes and other sources of water that contribute to the [[hydrosphere]]. The Earth's [[Geographical pole|poles]] are mostly covered with ice that includes the solid ice of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] and the [[sea ice]] of the [[polar ice packs]]. The [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]] remains active, with a solid iron [[inner core]], a liquid [[outer core]] that generates the magnetic field, and a thick layer of relatively solid [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]].

The Earth [[Gravitational interaction|gravitationally interacts]] with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the [[Moon]]. During one orbit around the Sun, the Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 [[solar time|solar days]], or one [[sidereal year]].<ref group="n" name="sidereal_solar"/> The Earth's axis of rotation is [[Axial tilt|tilted]] 23.4<U+00B0> away from the [[perpendicular]] of its [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]], producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface with a period of one [[tropical year]] (365.24 solar days).<ref name=yoder1995/> The Moon is the Earth's only [[natural satellite]]. It began orbiting the Earth about {{nowrap|4.53 billion years ago (bya)}}. The Moon's gravitational interaction with the Earth stimulates ocean [[tide]]s, stabilizes the axial tilt, and gradually slows the planet's rotation.

Originally, ''earth'' was written in lowercase and, from [[early Middle English]], its [[definite]] sense as "the globe" was expressed as ''[[definite article|the]] earth''. By [[early Modern English]], many nouns were capitalized and ''the earth'' became (and often remained) ''the Earth'', particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as ''Earth'', by analogy with the names of the [[Solar System|other planets]].<ref name=oedearth/> [[House style]]s now vary: [[Oxford spelling]] recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes Earth when appearing as a name (e.g. "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by ''the'' (e.g. "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"<ref name="oxford">''The New Oxford Dictionary of English'', {{nowrap|1st ed.}} "earth".

The shape of the Earth approximates an [[oblate spheroid]], a sphere flattened along the axis from pole to pole such that there is a [[equatorial bulge|bulge]] around the [[equator]].<ref name=milbert_smith96/> This bulge results from the [[rotation]] of the Earth, and causes the diameter at the equator to be {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.<ref name="ngdc2006"/> Thus the point on the surface farthest from the Earth's center of mass is the [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 The 'Highest' Spot on Earth?] NPR.org Consultado el 25-07-2010</ref> The average diameter of the reference spheroid is about {{convert|12742|km|mi}}, which is approximately 40,000&nbsp;km/[[pi|<U+03C0>]], as the [[Meter#Meridional definition|meter]] was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the [[North Pole]] through [[Paris]], [[France]].<ref name=nist_length2000/>

Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to the Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{val|10911|ul=m}} below local sea level), while [[Mount Everest]] (8,848&nbsp;m above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%. If Earth were shrunk to the size of a cue ball, some areas of Earth such as mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like small imperfections, while most of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[Abyssal plain|Abyssal Plains]], would actually feel smoother than a cue ball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher= Billiards Digest |date=2013-06-01 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>  Due to the equatorial bulge, the surface locations farthest from the Earth's center are the summits of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mount Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] and [[Huascar<U+00E1>n]] in [[Peru]].<ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"/><ref name=ps20_5_16/><ref name=lancet365_9462_831/><ref name=tall_tales/>

===Chemical composition===
{{See also|Abundance of elements on Earth}}
The [[Earth mass|mass of the Earth]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}}. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.<ref name=pnas71_12_6973/>

The geochemist [[Frank Wigglesworth Clarke|F. W. Clarke]] calculated that a little more than 47% of the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] consists of oxygen. The more common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides; chlorine, sulfur and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. The principal oxides are silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash and soda. The silica functions principally as an acid, forming silicates, and all the commonest minerals of igneous rocks are of this nature. From a computation based on 1,672 analyses of all kinds of rocks, Clarke deduced that 99.22% were composed of 11 oxides (see the table at right), with the other constituents occurring in minute quantities.<ref>{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}</ref>

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
The Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties, but unlike the other terrestrial planets, it has a distinct outer and inner core. The outer layer of the Earth is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid [[crust (geology)|crust]], which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovi<U+010D>i<U+0107> discontinuity]], and the thickness of the crust varies: averaging {{val|6|ul=km}} (kilometers) under the oceans and 30-{{val|50|u=km}} on the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are comprised. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and {{val|660|ul=km}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].<ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/> The inner core may rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1<U+2013>0.5<U+00B0> per year.<ref name=science309_5739_1313/>

===Heat===
The Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of [[Gravitational binding energy|residual heat from planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).<ref name="turcotte"/> The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within the Earth are [[Potassium|potassium-40]], [[Uranium|uranium-238]], [[uranium-235]], and [[Thorium|thorium-232]].<ref name=sanders20031210/> At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|Celsius}},<ref>http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter</ref> and the pressure could reach 360&nbsp;[[GPa]].<ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/> Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in the Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives had been depleted, the Earth's heat production would have been much higher. This extra heat production, twice present-day at approximately {{val|3|ul=byr}},<ref name="turcotte" /> would have increased temperature gradients with radius, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon [[igneous rock]]s such as [[komatiites]] that are rarely formed today.<ref name=epsl121_1/>

The mean heat loss from the Earth is {{nowrap|87 mW m<sup><U+2212>2</sup>}}, for a global heat loss of {{nowrap|4.42 <U+00D7> 10<sup>13</sup> W}}.<ref name=jg31_3_267/> A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by [[mantle plume]]s; a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock.

The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the [[lithosphere]], the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the [[Oceanic crust|crust]] there is much thinner than that of the [[Continental crust|continents]].<ref name="heat loss" />

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
The mechanically rigid outer layer of the Earth, the [[lithosphere]], is broken into pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], at which two plates come together, [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], at which two plates are pulled apart, and [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], in which two plates slide past one another laterally. [[Earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur along these plate boundaries.<ref name=kious_tilling1999/> The tectonic plates ride on top of the [[asthenosphere]], the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates,<ref name=seligman2008/> and their motion is strongly coupled with convection patterns inside mantle.

As the tectonic plates migrate across the planet, the ocean floor is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. The combination of these processes continually recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=myr}} old in age. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific, and has an estimated age of about {{val|200|u=myr}}.<ref name=duennebier1999/><ref name=noaa20070307/> By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is {{val|4030|u=myr}}.<ref name=cmp134_3/>

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of [[South America]] and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and {{val|55|u=mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of 75&nbsp;mm/year<ref name=podp2000/> and the Pacific Plate moving 52<U+2013>69&nbsp;mm/year. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of about 21&nbsp;mm/year.<ref name=gps_time_series/>

The Earth's [[terrain]] varies greatly from place to place. About 70.8%<ref name="Pidwirny 2006_8"/> of the surface is covered by water, with much of the [[continental shelf]] below sea level. This equates to {{val|361.132|end=&nbsp;million|ul=km2}} (139.43 million sq mi).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html |title=CIA&nbsp;<U+2013> The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> The submerged surface has mountainous features, including a globe-spanning [[mid-ocean ridge]] system, as well as undersea volcanoes,<ref name="ngdc2006" /> [[oceanic trench]]es, [[submarine canyon]]s, [[oceanic plateau]]s and [[abyssal plain]]s. The remaining 29.2% ({{val|148.94|end=&nbsp;million|ul=km2}}, or 57.51 million sq mi) not covered by water consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other [[landform]]s.

The planetary surface undergoes reshaping over [[geological time]] periods due to [[erosion and tectonics|tectonics and erosion]]. The surface features built up or deformed through plate tectonics are subject to steady [[weathering]] and [[erosion]] from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], thermal cycles, and chemical effects. [[Glaciation]], [[coastal erosion]], the build-up of [[coral reef]]s, and large meteorite impacts<ref name=kring/> also act to reshape the landscape.
[[File:AYool topography 15min.png|left|thumb|Present-day Earth [[terrain|altimetry]] and [[bathymetry]]. Data from the [[National Geophysical Data Center]]'s [http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/ TerrainBase Digital Terrain Model].]]

The [[continental crust]] consists of lower density material such as the [[igneous rock]]s [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.<ref name=layers_earth/> [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by [[sedimentary rock]]s, although they form about 5% of the crust.<ref name=jessey/> The third form of rock material found on the Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant [[silicate mineral]]s on the Earth's surface include [[quartz]], the [[feldspar]]s, [[amphibole]], [[mica]], [[pyroxene]] and [[olivine]].<ref name=de_pater_lissauer2010/> Common [[carbonate mineral]]s include [[calcite]] (found in [[limestone]]) and [[dolomite]].<ref name=wekn_bulakh2004/>

The [[pedosphere]] is the outermost layer of the Earth's continental surface and is composed of [[soil]] and subject to [[pedogenesis|soil formation processes]]. It exists at the interface of the [[lithosphere]], atmosphere, [[hydrosphere]] and biosphere. The total arable land is 13.31% of the land surface, with 4.71% supporting permanent crops.<ref name=cia/> Close to 40% of the Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3{{e|7}}&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of cropland and 3.4{{e|7}}&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of pastureland.<ref name=fao1994/>

The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of <U+2212>418&nbsp;m at the [[Dead Sea]], to a 2005-estimated maximum altitude of 8,848&nbsp;m at the top of [[Mount Everest]]. The mean height of land above sea level is 840&nbsp;m.<ref name=sverdrup/>

Besides being divided logically into [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]] hemispheres centered on the poles, the Earth has been divided arbitrarily into [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] hemispheres. The surface of the Earth is traditionally divided into seven continents and various seas. As people settled and organized the planet, nearly all the land was divided into [[nation]]s.

===Hydrosphere===
{{main|Hydrosphere}}
[[File:Earth elevation histogram 2.svg|thumb|Elevation histogram of Earth's surface]]
The abundance of water on the Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. The Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000&nbsp;m. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]] with a depth of 10,911.4&nbsp;m.<ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/><ref name=kaiko7000/>

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&nbsp;[[metric ton]]s, or about 1/4400 of the total mass of the Earth. The oceans cover an area of {{val|3.618|e=8|ul=km2}} with a mean depth of {{val|3682|ul=m}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{val|1.332|e=9|ul=km3}}.<ref name=ocean23_2_112/> If all of the Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8&nbsp;km.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean ''Sphere depth of the ocean,'' Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]</ref><ref>[http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 ''Third rock from the Sun - restless Earth'', NASA's Cosmos]</ref>

About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.<ref>[http://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html "The World of Water", USGS]</ref>

The average [[salinity]] of the Earth's oceans is about 35&nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).<ref name=kennish2001/> Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.<ref name=mullen2002/> The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.<ref name=natsci_oxy4/> Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].<ref name=michon2006/> Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Ni<U+00F1>o-Southern Oscillation]].<ref name=sample2005/>

===Atmosphere===
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth}}
The [[atmospheric pressure]] on the Earth's surface averages 101.325&nbsp;[[kPa]], with a [[scale height]] of about 8.5&nbsp;km.<ref name="earth_fact_sheet"/> It has a composition of 78% [[nitrogen]] and 21% [[oxygen]], with trace amounts of [[water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]] and other gaseous molecules. The height of the [[troposphere]] varies with latitude, ranging between 8&nbsp;km at the poles to 17&nbsp;km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.<ref name=geerts_linacre97/>

The Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. [[Oxygen evolution#Oxygen evolution in nature|Oxygenic photosynthesis]] evolved {{val|2.7|u=bya}}, [[oxygen catastrophe|forming]] the primarily nitrogen<U+2013>oxygen atmosphere of today.<ref name="NYT-20131003" /> This change enabled the proliferation of [[aerobic organisms]] as well as the formation of the [[ozone layer]], which blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.<ref name="atmosphere"/> This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]] and [[ozone]] are the primary [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface would be <U+2212>18&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, in contrast to the current +15&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, and life would likely not exist.<ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" />

====Weather and climate====
{{Main|Weather|Climate}}
[[File:MODIS Map.jpg|thumb|Satellite [[cloud cover]] image of the Earth using [[NASA]]'s [[Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer]]]]
The Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11&nbsp;km of the surface. This lowest layer is called the [[troposphere]]. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises, and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.<ref name="moran2005"/>

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30<U+00B0> latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30<U+00B0> and 60<U+00B0>.<ref name="berger2002"/> [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.<ref name=rahmstorf2003/>

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].<ref name="moran2005" /> Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land, and is a primary factor in the [[erosion]] of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. [[Atmospheric circulation]], [[Topography|topolographic features]] and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.<ref name=hydrologic_cycle/>

The amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4&nbsp;<U+00B0>C per degree of latitude away from the equator.<ref name=sadava_heller2006/> The Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.<ref name=climate_zones/> Climate can also be classified based on the temperature and precipitation, with the climate regions characterized by fairly uniform air masses. The commonly used [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] system (as modified by [[Wladimir K<U+00F6>ppen]]'s student Rudolph Geiger) has five broad groups (humid tropics, [[Desert|arid]], humid middle latitudes, [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.<ref name="berger2002" />

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the full Moon partially obscured by the Earth's atmosphere. ''[[NASA]] image'']]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].<ref name="atmosphere" /> Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].<ref name=sciweek2004/> Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on the Earth. The [[K<U+00E1>rm<U+00E1>n line]], defined as 100&nbsp;km above the Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].<ref name=cordoba2004/>

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can [[escape velocity|escape]] from the Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|leakage of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.<ref name=jas31_4_1118/> The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of the Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is believed to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.<ref name=sci293_5531_839/> Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on the Earth.<ref name=abedon1997/> In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of [[methane]] in the upper atmosphere.<ref name=arwps4_265/>

{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}
The main part of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[dynamo]] process that converts kinetic energy of fluid convective motion into electrical and magnetic field energy.  The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to the Earth's surface, where it is, to rough approximation, a [[dipole]].  The poles of the dipole are located close to the Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 <U+00D7> 10<sup><U+2212>5</sup> [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 <U+00D7> 10<sup>15</sup> T m<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref name=lang2003/>  The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.<ref name=fitzpatrick2006/><ref name=campbelwh/>

===Magnetosphere===
The extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the [[solar wind]] are deflects are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Since the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which wave propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. [[Charged particles]] are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as the Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.

During a magnetic storm, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere, directed along field lines into the Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].<ref name=stern2005/>

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}

[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun<U+2014>its mean solar day<U+2014>is 86,400&nbsp;seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025&nbsp;[[SI]]&nbsp;seconds).<ref name=aj136_5_1906/> Because the Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration]], each day varies between 0 and 2 [[SI]] [[milliseconds|ms]] longer.<ref name=USNO_TSD/><ref>http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat</ref>

The Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.098903691 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.098903691{{smallsup|s}}.}}<ref name=IERS/><ref group="n" name="Aoki"/> The Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean vernal [[equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.09053083288 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.09053083288{{smallsup|s}})}} {{As of|1982|lc=y}}.<ref name=IERS/> Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&nbsp;ms.<ref name=seidelmann1992/> The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623<U+2013>2005<ref name=iers1623/> and 1962<U+2013>2005.<ref name=iers1962/>

Apart from [[meteor]]s within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in the Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15<U+00B0>/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from the Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.<ref name=zeilik1998/><ref name=angular/>

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
The Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150&nbsp;million kilometers every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1<U+00B0>/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&nbsp;hours<U+2014>a [[Solar time|solar day]]<U+2014>for the Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of the Earth averages about 29.8&nbsp;km/s (107,000&nbsp;km/h), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to the Earth's diameter, about 12,742&nbsp;km, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000&nbsp;km, in about 3.5 hours.<ref name="earth fact sheet"/>

The Moon and the Earth orbit a common [[barycentre|barycenter]] every 27.32&nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth<U+2013>Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of the Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: the Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.4&nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth<U+2013>Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth<U+2013>Moon plane is tilted up to <U+00B1>5.1&nbsp;degrees against the Earth<U+2013>Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.<ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /><ref name="moon_fact_sheet"/>

The [[Hill sphere]], or [[Gravity|gravitational]] sphere of influence, of the Earth is about 1.5&nbsp;Gm or 1,500,000&nbsp;km in radius.<ref name=vazquez_etal2006/><ref group="n" name="hill_radius"/> This is the maximum distance at which the  Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

The Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] and orbits about 28,000&nbsp;[[Light-year|light years]] from the center of the galaxy. It is about 20&nbsp;light years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm|Orion spiral arm]].<ref name=nasa20051201/>

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{main|Axial tilt}}
Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes [[season]]al change in climate, with summer in the [[northern hemisphere]] occurring when the North Pole is pointing toward the Sun, and winter taking place when the pole is pointed away. During the summer, the day lasts longer and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes generally cooler and the days shorter. In North temperate latitudes, the sun rises north of true East during the Summer Soltice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The sun rises south of true east in the summer for the Southern Temperate Zone, and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the [[southern hemisphere]] the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons are determined by the [[solstice]]s<U+2014>the point in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun<U+2014>and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the northern hemisphere, [[Winter Solstice]] occurs on about December&nbsp;21, [[Summer Solstice]] is near June&nbsp;21, [[Spring Equinox]] is around March&nbsp;20 and [[Autumnal Equinox]] is about September&nbsp;23. In the Southern hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the Summer and Winter Solstices exchanged and the Spring and Autumnal Equinox dates switched.<ref name=bromberg2008/>

[[File:Earth-Moon system as seen from Saturn (PIA17171).jpg|left|thumb|NASA's [[Cassini spacecraft]] photographs the Earth and the [[Moon]] (visible bottom-right) from [[Saturn]] (July 19, 2013).]]

The angle of the Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axials tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&nbsp;years.<ref name=lin2006/> The orientation (rather than the angle) of the Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across the Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. The Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.<ref name=fisher19960205/>

In modern times, the Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around January&nbsp;3, and its [[aphelion]] around July&nbsp;4. These dates change over time due to [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth<U+2013>Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%<ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/> in solar energy reaching the Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the southern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the southern hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the southern hemisphere.<ref name=williams20051230/>

== Habitability ==
{{see also|Planetary habitability}}
[[File:Pingualuit aerial 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pingualuit crater|This ancient impact crater]], now filled with water, marks the Earth's surface]]

A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. The Earth provides liquid water<U+2014>an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].<ref name=ab2003/> The distance of the Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere and protective magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.<ref name=dole1970/>

===Biosphere===
{{main|Biosphere}}
[[File:EilatFringingReef.jpg|thumb|left|Coral reef and beach]]
A planet's life forms are sometimes said to form a "biosphere". The Earth's biosphere is generally believed to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=bya}}.<ref name="NYT-20131003" /> The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].<ref name=amnat163_2_192/>

Since the 1960s, it has been hypothesized that severe [[Glacier|glacial]] action between 750 and {{val|580|u=mya}}, during the [[Neoproterozoic]], covered much of the planet in a sheet of ice.

The Earth provides resources that are exploitable by humans for useful purposes. Some of these are [[non-renewable resources]], such as [[fossil fuel]]s, that are difficult to replenish on a short time scale.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from the Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magma]]tism, erosion and plate tectonics.<ref name=mnpl_utx2006/> These bodies form concentrated sources for many [[metal]]s and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

The Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including [[food]], wood, [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.<ref name=science299_5607_673/> In 1980, 5,053&nbsp;[[Hectare|Mha]] (50.53 million km<sup>2</sup>) of the Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 6,788&nbsp;Mha (67.88 million km<sup>2</sup>) was grasslands and pasture, and 1,501&nbsp;Mha (15.01 million km<sup>2</sup>) was cultivated as croplands.<ref name="Turner1990"/> The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2}}.<ref name=cia/> Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
Large areas of the Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 deaths per year.<ref name=walsh2008/> Many places are subject to [[earthquake]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[volcano|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species extinction, [[soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], soil depletion, erosion, and introduction of [[invasive species]].

According to the [[United Nations]], a scientific consensus exists linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].<ref name=un20070202/>

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on the Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting the Earth. [[Surveying]], the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent [[navigation]], the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.

The Earth's human population reached approximately seven billion on October 31, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/various-7-billionth-babies-celebrated-worldwide-064439018.html|title=Various '7 billionth' babies celebrated worldwide|accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> Projections indicate that the [[world population|world's human population]] will reach 9.2&nbsp;billion in 2050.<ref name=un2006/> Most of the growth is expected to take place in [[developing nations]].

It is estimated that one-eighth of the Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on <U+2013> three-quarters of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one quarter as land.

{{Main|Earth in culture}}
The standard astronomical symbol of the Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, [[File:Earth symbol.svg|18px]].<ref name=liungman2004/>

Unlike other planets in the Solar System, humankind did not begin to view the Earth as a moving object until the 16th century.<ref name=arnett20060716/> The Earth has often been personified as a deity, in particular a goddess. In many cultures a [[mother goddess]] is also portrayed as a [[fertility deity]]. [[Creation myth]]s in many religions recall a story involving the creation of the Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. A variety of religious groups, often associated with [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] branches of Protestantism<ref name=Dutch2002/> or Islam,<ref name=edis2003/> assert that their [[Hermeneutics|interpretations]] of these creation myths in [[Religious text|sacred texts]] are [[Creation science|literal truth]] and should be considered alongside or replace conventional scientific accounts of the formation of the Earth and the origin and development of life.<ref name=jge53_3_319/> Such assertions are opposed by the [[scientific community]]<ref name=arghg4_143/><ref name=sec_nap2008/> and by other religious groups.<ref name=jrst43_4_419/><ref name=frye1983/><ref name=nathist106_2_16/> A prominent example is the [[creation<U+2013>evolution controversy]].

In the past, there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]],<ref name=russell1997/> but this was displaced by [[spherical Earth]], a concept that has been credited to [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|date=1876|page=49}}</ref> [[Culture|Human cultures]] have developed many views of the planet, including its [[Anthropomorphism|personification]] as a planetary [[deity]], its shape [[flat Earth|as flat]], its position as [[Geocentric model|the center of the universe]], and in the modern [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Principle]], as a single, self-regulating organism in its own right.

===Formation===
{{Main|History of the Earth}}
[[File:Archivo 362.png|thumb|Artist's impression of the birth of the Solar System]]The earliest material found in the Solar System is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (bya);<ref name=bowring_housch1995/> therefore, it is inferred that the Earth must have been formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] around this time. By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=bya}}<ref name="age_earth1" /> the primordial Earth had formed. The [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] bodies occurred in tandem with the Sun. In theory a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that in tandem with the star. A nebula contains gas, ice grains and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclides]]). In [[nebular theory]] [[planetesimal]]s commence forming as [[Granular material#Granular gases|particulate]] accrues by [[cohesion (geology)|cohesive clumping]] and then by gravity. The assembly of the primordial Earth proceeded for 10<U+2013>{{val|20|ul=myr}}.<ref name=nature418_6901_949/> The Moon formed shortly thereafter, about {{val|4.53|u=bya}}.<ref name=science310_5754_1671/>

The formation of the Moon remains a topic of debate. The [[working hypothesis]] is that it formed by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] from material loosed from the Earth after a Mars-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|impacted]] with the Earth.<ref name=reilly20091022/> This model, however, is not self-consistent. In this scenario, the mass of Theia is 10% of that of the Earth,<ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/> it impacted with the Earth in a glancing blow,<ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/> and some of its mass merges with the Earth. Between approximately 3.8 and {{val|4.1|u=bya}}, numerous [[asteroid]] impacts during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to the Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
The Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed by [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity and [[outgassing]] that included [[water vapor]]. The [[origin of the world's oceans]] was condensation augmented by water and ice delivered by [[asteroid]]s, [[Protoplanet|proto-planets]], and [[comet]]s.<ref name="watersource"/> In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].<ref name=asp2002/> By {{val|3.5|u=bya}}, the [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].<ref name=physorg20100304/>
A [[Crust (geology)|crust]] formed when the molten outer layer of the Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid as the accumulated water vapor began to act in the atmosphere. The two models<ref name=williams_santosh2004/> that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms<ref name=science164_1229/> or, more likely, a rapid growth<ref name=tp322_19/> early in Earth history<ref name=rg6_175/> followed by a long-term steady continental area.<ref name=science310_5756_1947/><ref name=jaes23_799/><ref name=ajes38_613/> Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from the Earth's interior. On [[Geologic time scale|time scales]] lasting hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have formed and broken up three times. Roughly {{val|750|ul=mya}} (million years ago), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600<U+2013>{{val|540|u=mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=mya}}.<ref name=as92_324/>

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40<U+2013>{{val|100000|u=years}}. The last continental glaciation ended 10,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref name=psc/>

===Predicted future===
{{Main|Future of the Earth}}
Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to continue to support life range from {{Nowrap|500 million years (myr)}}, to as long as {{Nowrap|2.3 billion years (byr)}}.<ref name="britt2000" /><ref name=carrington /><ref name="pnas1_24_9576" /> The future of the planet is closely tied to that of the Sun. As a result of the steady accumulation of helium at the Sun's core, the [[Solar luminosity|star's total luminosity]] will slowly increase. The luminosity of the Sun will grow by 10% over the next {{val|1.1|ul=byr}} and by 40% over the next {{val|3.5|u=byr}}.<ref name="sun_future"/> Climate models indicate that the rise in radiation reaching the Earth is likely to have dire consequences, including the loss of the planet's oceans.<ref name=icarus74_472/>

The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[Carbon cycle|CO<sub>2</sub> cycle]], reducing its concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately 500-{{val|900|u=myr}}.<ref name="britt2000" /> The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, so animal life will become extinct within several million more years.<ref name=ward_brownlee2002/> After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared<ref name=carrington/> and the mean global temperature will reach {{val|70|ul=degC}}<ref name=ward_brownlee2002/> ({{val|158|ul=degF}}). The Earth is expected to be effectively habitable for about another {{val|500|u=myr}} from that point,<ref name="britt2000"/> although this may be extended up to {{val|2.3|u=byr}} if the nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.<ref name=pnas1_24_9576/> Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.<ref name=hess5_4_569/>
[[File:Solar Life Cycle.svg|thumb|800px|center|alt=14 billion year timeline showing Sun's present age at {{val|4.6|ul=byr}}; from {{val|6|u=byr}} Sun gradually warming, becoming a red dwarf at {{val|10|u=byr}}, "soon" followed by its transformation into a white dwarf star|Life cycle of the Sun]]
The Sun, as part of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]], will become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=byr}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|km| lk=off|abbr=on}}, which is about 250 times its present radius.<ref name="sun_future" /><ref name="sun_future_schroder"/> The Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, the Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|km| abbr=on}} from the Sun, when the star reaches its maximum radius. The planet was, therefore, initially expected to escape envelopment by the expanded Sun's sparse outer atmosphere, though most, if not all, remaining life would have been destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).<ref name="sun_future" /> A 2008 simulation indicates that the Earth's orbit will decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the red giant Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.<ref name="sun_future_schroder" /> After that, the Sun's core will collapse into a [[white dwarf]], as its outer layers are ejected into space as a [[planetary nebula]]. The matter that once made up the Earth will be released into interstellar space, where it may one day become incorporated into a new generation of planets and other celestial bodies.

[[File:FullMoon2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Full moon]] as seen from the Earth's [[northern hemisphere]]]]
{{Main|Moon}}
The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of that of the Earth. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites orbiting other planets are called "moons" after the Earth's Moon.

The gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon causes [[tides]] on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit the Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits the Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from the Earth at the rate of approximately 38&nbsp;mm a year. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications<U+2014>and the lengthening of the Earth's day by about 23&nbsp;[[Microsecond|<U+00B5>s]] a year<U+2014>add up to significant changes.<ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/> During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|ul=mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.<ref name=hannu_poropudas19911216/>

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that the Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.<ref name=aaa428_261/> Some theorists believe that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to the Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.<ref name=nature410_6830_773/>

Viewed from the Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.<ref name=angular /> This allows total and annular [[solar eclipse]]s to occur on the Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact theory]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size [[protoplanet]] called [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements, and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of the Earth's crust.<ref name=nature412_708/>

==Asteroids and artificial satellites==
[[File:STS-130 Endeavour flyaround 5.jpg|thumb|The [[International Space Station]] is an artificial satellite in orbit around the Earth.]]
The Earth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.<ref name=whitehouse20021021/><ref name=christou_asher2011/> A [[trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is librating around the leading [[Lagrange point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in the [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]].<ref name=Connors/><ref name=Choi/>

{{As of|2011}}, there were 931 operational, man-made [[satellite]]s orbiting the Earth.<ref name=ucs/> There are also inoperative satellites and over 300,000 pieces of [[space debris]]. The Earth's largest artificial satellite is the [[International Space Station]].
