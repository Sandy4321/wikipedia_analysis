'''Mount Wilson''' is one of the better-known peaks in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]], part of the [[Angeles National Forest]] in [[Los Angeles County, California]]. It is the location of the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] and has become the astronomical center of Southern California with {{convert|60|in|0|adj=on}} and {{convert|100|in|0|adj=on}} telescopes, and {{convert|60|ft|m|1|adj=mid|-tall}} and {{convert|150|ft|m|1|adj=mid|-tall}} [[solar power tower|solar towers]]. The summit is at {{convert|5710|ft|m|0}}. While not the tallest peak in its vicinity, it is high enough in elevation that snow can sometimes interrupt astronomical activities on the mountain. All of the mountains west of the summit are far shorter leading to unobstructed views all the way to Pacific Ocean. On an extremely clear day [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], some 70 miles southwest, is visible, with the horizon stretching another 30 miles beyond that.

Mount Wilson is also heavily utilized for [[antenna farm|relay broadcasting]] of radio and television for the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]].

== History ==
The native inhabitants of the San Gabriels probably belonged to various tribes of the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] people who lived in the low-lying valleys. Granite outcroppings along the Angeles Crest show signs of meal preparations with [[metate]] pots ground into rock surfaces.

The first recorded exploration of the mountain was performed by [[Benjamin Davis Wilson]] also known as "Don Benito". Wilson, who was the grandfather of [[George S. Patton, Jr.]], was the owner of [[Rancho San Pascual]] in about 1852 and ran a winery at his home, "[[Rancho Huerta de Cuati|Lake Vineyard]]", which was in the area of today's [[San Marino, California|San Marino]]. Wilson hoped to find a suitable wood for his casks but was disappointed by the poor quality of trees on the mountain. He built a trail, following an established Indian route, which became known as the Mount Wilson Trail. In turn Wilson's trail became the predecessor of the [[Mount Wilson Toll Road]]. He was surprised to find line shacks at the summit, probably left by Spaniards who were known to track down destructive grizzly bears. He built a three-room cabin along the trail called "Halfway House." Despite Wilson's inability to find adequate wood, the hike became a popular pastime for locals who would make a weekend trip to the summit. These hikers built signal fires on the summit to let people below know that the party had arrived safely.

In 1889 Professor [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]] of [[Harvard University]] along with [[Alvan Clark|Alvan P. Clark]], famous lens grinder, prepared an experiment with a {{convert|4|and|13|in|0|adj=on}} telescopes at Mount Wilson. University students would operate the telescopes for nighttime viewing, but more often than not they would log in "bad weather, no visibility" and head to town to relieve their boredom. The small observatory was abandoned with plans to build a larger one at a later date.<ref name="oldradio">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/LA/mtwilson1.htm|title=History of Mt. Wilson|publisher=oldradio.com|accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>

In 1891 Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] incorporated the [[Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad]] with the plan of building a scenic mountain railroad to the summit of Mt. Wilson. At the same time land and easement disputes between camp owners Steils and Strain were going on over the public and private use of the Mount Wilson Trail. The courts ruled that the trail was a public thoroughfare and that any blockading would be illegal. At the foot of the mountain, a local contractor Thomas Banbury built a 10-mile (15&nbsp;km) roadway to be named "The New Mount Wilson Trail," aka [[Mount Wilson Toll Road|"The Mount Wilson Toll Road."]] Passage fare was 25<U+00A2> round trip for hikers and 50<U+00A2> for horseback.<ref name="oldradio"/>

In 1892 Prof. [[Charles William Eliot]], president of Harvard University, planned to have two 40-inch (102&nbsp;cm) lenses shipped from [[Alvan Clark & Sons]] in Corning, New York to the newly named Mount Harvard, directly adjacent to Mt. Wilson. The money was to be put up by Mr. Spence of the University of Southern California. Walter Raymond, of Raymond & Whitcomb Travel Agency, Boston, and owner of the Raymond Hotel, Pasadena, offered to pay for rail from New York. Lowe offered to take the lenses up via his yet-to-be-built Mt. Wilson Railway. Spence died suddenly and left no word of the money for the project. The lenses ended up at [[Yerkes Observatory]] in Wisconsin, and Lowe's railway ended up going to Oak Mountain ([[Mount Lowe (California)|Mount Lowe]]).<ref name="oldradio"/>

By 1901 The Mount Wilson Toll Road Co. had purchased [[Henninger Flats]], Strain's Camp, Martin's Camp, and 640 acres (2.6&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of the summit.<ref name="oldradio"/>

In 1903 [[George Ellery Hale]] visited Mt. Wilson only to become enthused by the perfect conditions for which to set up an observatory, which would become the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. In 1905 {{convert|40|acre|m2}} were leased for 99 years by the Carnegie Institute for telescopes, and construction began on a new Mt. Wilson Hotel. In 1908 a 60-inch (1524&nbsp;mm) telescope was installed at the summit, and in 1910 the {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} Solar Tower was erected. In 1913 the hotel burned down and was replaced by a second hotel that lasted until its demolition in 1966. The Toll Road opened to automobiles in 1912 and lasted until 1936.<ref name="oldradio"/>

In 1917 the 100-inch [[Hooker Telescope]] became operational and would be the world's largest telescope until the opening of the 200-inch [[Palomar Observatory|Palomar]] [[Hale Telescope]] in 1948.<ref name="oldradio"/>

In 1919, American astronomer Edwin Hubble arrived at Mt. Wilson and, throughout the 1920s, made many astronomical discoveries using the Hooker Telescope.  Among his contributions are the observational proof that many nebulous objects are actually galaxies beyond our own Milky Way galaxy, the classification of galaxies according to the Hubble sequence, and the development of Hubble's Law relating a galaxy's observed red shift to its distance away.  These contributions led to an understanding that the universe is not static, but expanding.

In 1926 [[Albert Abraham Michelson]] made what was the most precise calculation of the [[speed of light]] at the time by measuring the round-trip travel time of light between Mount Wilson and [[Mount San Antonio]] 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) away.<ref name="oldradio"/>

The first television antenna on Mount Wilson was erected in 1947 for pioneer station [[KTLA]] Channel 5.  At about the same time, the first FM station broadcast from Mount Wilson, which was the old [[KPWR|KFI-FM]] on 105.9 FM (signed off in 1950).  The mountain became so popular as a site for transmitters that, in 1963, the [[Metromedia]] company bought {{Convert|720|acre|km2|1}} from the Mount Wilson Hotel Company. Metromedia built Skyline Park, which consisted of a pavilion, a children's zoo and landscaped walks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldradio.com/archives/stations/LA/mtwilson3.htm |title=The Story of Mt. Wilson, California Part 3 <U+2013> Broadcasters Invade |publisher=oldradio.com|accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref> The park closed in 1976 after operating at a loss for almost a decade. The property is now the home of numerous transmitters serving the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and includes radio, television and microwave relay facilities.

== Observatory salvaged ==
In 1984 the Carnegie Institute began the process of shutting down the observatories on Mount Wilson, opting to concentrate on newer sites in Chile. In 1986 the Mt. Wilson Institute was formed and plans to reopen the observatories were made so that by 2000 all the telescopes were back in operation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Construction began in 1996 for six 1-meter telescopes by the [[CHARA array|Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy]] at [[Georgia State University]]. This is the largest [[Astronomical interferometer|optical interferometric]] array ever built. Ground was broken for the telescopes in 1999 and the facility became operational in 2001.<ref>Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Web site (http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/), Retrieved 8-4-2011.</ref>

On the evening of August 30, 2009, the [[August 2009 California wildfires|Station Fire]] threatened the tower cluster and the Observatory, along with nearby Mount Harvard.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/08/station-fire-approaching-historic-mt-wilson-observatory-fire-officials-say.html | title=Station fire likely to hit historic Mt.
