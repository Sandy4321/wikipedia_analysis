The '''''Bramble''-class gunboat''' was a class of four [[gunboat]]s mounting six 4-inch guns, built for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1886. In 1887 the first three were reclassified as gunvessels.<ref name=RW/>

==Design==
The ''Bramble'' class was designed by [[William Henry White|William White]]. The ships were of composite construction, meaning that the iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts were of iron, while the hull was planked with timber. This had the advantage of allowing the vessels to be coppered, thus keeping marine growth under control, a problem that caused iron-hulled ships to be frequently docked.  They were {{convert|165|ft|m}} in length and displaced 715 tons.<ref name=RW/>

===Propulsion===
Triple-expansion steam engines built by [[Hawthorn Leslie]] (''Rattler''), North East Marine Engineering (''Wasp'') and [[Harland & Wolff]] (''Lizard'' and ''Bramble'') provided 1,000 [[indicated horsepower]] (''Rattler'' 1,200ihp) through a single screw, sufficient for {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=RW/>

===Armament===
Ships of the class were armed with six 4-inch 25-pounder [[British ordnance terms#QF|quick-firing guns]]. Four machine guns were also fitted.<ref name=RW/>
