'''Otis Victor Edelbrock, Sr.''' (1913 - 1962) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[automotive aftermarket]] performance [[parts]] [[engineering|engineer]] and [[racing|racer]]. Victor, known as "Vic", established [[Edelbrock|Edelbrock Corporation]] in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] in 1938 and is the father to [[Vic Edelbrock, Jr.|Otis Victor Edelbrock, Jr.]], who is now [[president]] and [[CEO]] of the Edelbrock corporation.

==Early years==
Vic Sr. was born in a small [[farming]] community near [[Wichita, Kansas]] in 1913. After the family grocery store burned down in 1927, Vic left school at the age of 14 to help support the family by ferrying [[Model T]] Fords from Wichita to the many outlying farms in the area. The frequent stops to replace parts that shook loose on the region's dirt roads made Vic an expert in impromptu repair work.<ref name="Madigan Book">Madigan, Tom.

ISBN 1-931688-18-4</ref><ref name="1999 Annual Report">Edelbrock Corporation annual report 1999, Edelbrock Corporation, 1999.</ref> Soon after, he found work in a local repair shop, working as an [[auto mechanic]].<ref name="History">[http://www.edelbrock.com/automotive_new/misc/company/edelbrock_history.shtml History at Edelbrock's official website]</ref>

In 1931, the [[Great Depression]] hit Kansas, and Edelbrock decided to immigrate to [[California]] to live with his brother, Carl. Initially, Vic took a job as an auto mechanic. In order to earn some extra money to open his own repair shop, Vic took an evening job in downtown [[Los Angeles]] parking cars at a large apartment complex. It was a chance encounter at this parking complex where Vic bumped into a 19-year-old Irish girl named Katherine (Katie) Collins, who was working as a day maid. Despite the fact that Katie was engaged, Vic managed to convince her to give him a chance and not marry her fianc<U+00E9>. Vic and Katie married just eight weeks after meeting in 1933.<ref name="Madigan Book"/> 

He opened a repair garage on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] in [[Beverly Hills]]. The business experienced growth in 1934 and relocated to the corner of [[Venice Boulevard]] and Hoover in [[Los Angeles]]. [[Bobby Meeks]] was hired as an assistant.

Between 1934 and the start of [[World War II]], the small repair garage relocated three more times. Vic, Jr. was born in 1936. Two years later in 1938, he purchased a project car, a 1932 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Roadster]] [[hot rod]].<ref>[http://www.corvettefever.com/eventcoverage/153_0401_edelbrock_tour_vics_garage/index.html Corvette Fever periodical], Retrieved [[June 26]] [[2007]]</ref> For this car, Victor designed and manufactured the first product to feature the Edelbrock name, the ''Slingshot'' manifold, which essentially launched the new [[business]] known as ''Edelbrock''. Edelbrock took the car to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], and went 121.42 MPH weeks before America joined World War II. <ref name=NMARHoF>[http://www.worthyofhonor.com/Inductees/Edelbrock_Vic.htm Biography] at the [[National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame]]</ref>

During World War II, Vic's [[machinist]] skills were put to work [[welding]] in the [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] [[shipyard]]s and hand [[fabrication (metal)|fabricating]] [[aircraft]] parts. First. Vic worked at the Todd Shipyards, then later Edelbrock went to work for [[Len Saulter]], machining parts from newly developed exotic metals. This work was categorized as critical to the war effort and would keep Vic from being [[Conscription in the United States| drafted]] for the remainder of the war<ref name="Madigan Book">Madigan, Tom. ''Edelbrock: Made in USA'', Tehabi Books, 2005.</ref>.

==Racing Fame==
A major source of Edelbrock's fame in [[automotive]] [[racing]] was as a car owner. [[Offenhauser]] motors had a great power advantage over all of the other motors. <ref name=NMARHoF /> [[Rodger Ward]] used Edelbrock's V8-60 [[midget car]] on [[August 10]] [[1950]] to break the Offenhauser-equipped winning streak at the legendary [[Gilmore Stadium]] using his secret blend of [[nitromethane]].  <ref name=NMARHoF /> Edelbrock and Ward followed up the win by travelling to [[Orange Show Stadium]] in [[San Bernardino]] and winning the following night. The wins propelled Ward's career and Edelbrock Corporation. Nitro is now banned from almost all forms of [[dirt track racing]] (due to the required high maintenance costs). Nitromethane is now the industry standard as fuel in all [[top fuel]] dragsters and [[funny car]]s in [[drag racing]]. 

==Manufacturing==
Vic achieved an industry first in 1958 by getting one horsepower per cubic inch from a 283 Chevy small-block with the new Cross Ram manifold.<ref name="SEMA">http://www.sema.org/main/semaorghome.aspx?id=52520 SEMA</ref>

Vic died of [[cancer]] on November 11, 1962 at the early age of 49.<ref name="Madigan Book"/>  His son, Vic Edelbrock, Jr., led the company in the following decades.
