The '''Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority''', often referred to as the '''MBTA''' or '''The T,''' is the public operator of most [[bus]], [[Rapid transit|subway]], [[commuter rail]], and [[ferry]] routes in the greater [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] area.

The MBTA operates an independent law enforcement agency, the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police]]. In 2006, 31.60% of workers in the [[City limits|city proper]] commuted by [[public transport]].<ref>U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2006, Table S0802</ref>

The MBTA is one of only two U.S. transit agencies that operates all of the five major types of terrestrial mass transit vehicles: regional (commuter) rail trains, "heavy" rapid transit (subway/elevated) trains, light rail vehicles (trolleys), electric trolleybuses, and motor buses.

==History==
{{Main|History of the MBTA}}

[[Image:Boston railroad 1880.jpg|thumb|right|Steam railroads in Boston in 1880. From the [[U.S. Census Bureau]].]]
[[Image:West End Street Railway 1885.png|thumb|right|Planned West End Street Railway system, 1885; consolidation of these lines was complete by 1887. See also [[commons:Image:Boston horse rails 1880.jpg|1880 horse railway map]]]]

Mass transportation in Boston was provided by private companies, often granted charters by the state legislature for limited [[monopoly|monopolies]], with powers of [[eminent domain]] to establish a [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]], until the creation of the MTA in 1947. Development of mass transportation followed both existing economic and population patterns, and helped shape those patterns.

=== Railways ===
Shortly after the [[steam locomotive]] became practical for mass transportation, the private [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] was chartered in 1830, connecting Boston to [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], a major northerly [[mill town]], via one of the [[oldest railroads in North America]]. This marked the beginning of the development of American intercity railroads, which in Massachusetts would later become the MBTA Commuter Rail system and the [[Green Line "D" Branch]].

=== Streetcars ===
Starting with the opening of the [[Cambridge Railroad]] on March 26, 1856, a profusion of [[streetcar]] lines appeared in Boston under chartered companies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Therefore, in spite of changes of the companies, Boston is the city with the oldest continuously working streetcar system in the world. Later, many of these companies consolidated, and animal-drawn vehicles were converted to electric propulsion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Subways and elevated railways ===
Streetcar congestion in downtown Boston led to the establishment of [[Rapid transit|subway]]s and [[elevated rail]], the former in 1897 and the latter in 1901, resulting in the [[Tremont Street Subway]], the first active subway in the United States. These [[grade-separated]] railways both added additional transportation capacity and avoided delays caused by intersections with cross streets.<ref name="Famous Firsts in MA">
{{cite web|title=Famous Firsts in Massachusetts|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|url=http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/firsts_1800.htm|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref>
The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston came three years before the first underground line of the [[New York City Subway]], but 34 years after the first [[London Underground]] lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Park Street Station 1898.jpg|left|thumb|[[Park Street (MBTA station)|Park Street station in Boston]] on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] soon after opening, circa 1898]]
Various extensions and branches were built to the subway in both directions, bypassing more surface tracks. As more elevated lines were built, streetcar lines were cut back for faster downtown service.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Buses ===
The Boston Elevated Railway started replacing rail with [[bus]]es in 1922. In 1936, it started replacing rail with [[trackless trolley]]s. The last [[Middlesex and Boston Street Railway]] streetcar ran in 1930.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} By the beginning of 1953, the only [[Boston-area streetcar lines|remaining streetcar lines]] fed two tunnels - the main [[Tremont Street Subway]] network downtown and the short tunnel (now the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]]) in [[Harvard Square]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Public enterprise ===
The old elevated railways proved to be an eyesore and required several sharp curves in Boston's twisty streets. The [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] was closed in 1938 amidst declining ridership and was demolished in 1942. As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to rising [[automobile]] ownership, government takeover prevented abandonment and dismantlement. The MTA purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] in 1947.<ref>

[http://members.aol.com/netransit/private/LRV.html Boston's Green Line Crisis<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}
</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}

In the 1950s, the MTA ran new subway extensions, while the last two streetcar lines running into the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] of the [[Tremont Street Subway]] were substituted with buses in 1953 and 1962.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

On August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an enlarged service area.<ref name="netransit">{{cite web|url=http://www.transithistory.org/roster/MBTARouteHistory.pdf|title=Changes to Transit Service in the MBTA district|accessdate=4 January 2012|last=Belcher|first=Jonathan|date=5 November 2011|format=PDF|publisher=NETransit}}</ref> The original MTA district of 14 cities and towns was expanded to 78 cities and towns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The MBTA was formed partly to [[subsidize]] existing [[commuter rail]] operations. As this happened, the MBTA acquired lines in stages from 1973 through 1976 amidst large cutbacks in service and coverage area. Since then, many of these lines have seen service return.<ref name=netransit />

The MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines in 1965, and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. Shortage of streetcars among other factors caused bus substitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. The [[Green Line "A" Branch|"A" Branch]] ceased operating in 1969 and was replaced by the 57 bus.<ref name=netransit /> The portion of the [[Green Line "E" Branch|"E" Branch]] from [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] to [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] was [[bustitution|replaced by buses]] in 1985.<ref name=netransit />

The MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north and south from the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]] in 1968.<ref name=netransit /> As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes were dropped shortly before or after the takeover due to low ridership and high operating costs.

In the 1970s, the MBTA received a boost from the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] area-wide re-evaluation of the role of mass transit relative to highways. Producing a moratorium on highway construction inside [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], numerous mass transit lines were planned for expansion by the Voorhees-Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-ESL consulting team. The removal of elevated lines continued, and the closure of the [[Washington Street Elevated]] in 1987 brought the end of rapid transit service to the [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood. Between 1971 and 1985, the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] was extended both north and south, providing not only additional subway system coverage, but also major [[parking structure]]s at several of the terminal and intermediate stations.<ref name=netransit />

====Kickback scheme====
On April 30, 1981, MBTA General Manager James O'Leary found on his desk an envelope with the words "To Jim O'Leary For B.M.L." written on it. Thinking that it read "To Jim O'Leary From B.M.L.", O'Leary opened the envelope meant for MBTA Chairman and state Secretary of Transportation [[Barry Locke|Barry M. Locke]]. Inside were four progressively smaller envelopes, with the smallest containing ten $100 bills and an anonymous note instructing Locke to use a lower price when determining how much a [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] man would have to pay for abandoned MBTA land. That evening, O'Leary went to the home of [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Francis X. Bellotti]] and turned over the money and the envelopes to him.<ref>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=James|title=O'Leary testifies about envelopes in Locke trial; prosecution to rest|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JaMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oPwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5943,5119956&dq|accessdate=September 5, 2012|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=January 27, 1982}}</ref>

The following day, Locke was placed on an unpaid leave of absence from his posts after Governor [[Edward J. King]] learned that Bellotti was investigating Locke for accepting kickbacks in connection with MBTA leases in [[South Station]] and the contract for advertising space on MBTA vehicles.<ref>{{cite news|title=T head suspended|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R6krAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IP0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6992,613062|accessdate=August 11, 2011|agency=Associated Press  |date=May 4, 1981}}</ref>

A total of seventeen people, including Locke, and one corporation would be indicted for their roles in the kickback scheme.<ref>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=James|title=Suspended T official's trial starts|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=J6MrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oPwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2914,3061004&dq|accessdate=September 5, 2012|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=January 18, 1982}}</ref>

On February 2, 1982, Locke was convicted on five counts of conspiracy to commit bribery and larceny.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-Massachusetts official convicted in bribery case|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X5BTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4115,6423290|accessdate=August 13, 2011|newspaper=United Press International|date=February 2, 1982}}</ref> He became the first and currently only Massachusetts Cabinet Secretary to be convicted of a felony while in office since the state's adoption of the cabinet system in 1970.<ref name=Kindleberger>{{cite news|last=Kindleberger|first=R.S.|title=Locke Free, Vows to Aid Prison Reform in Mass.|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/662767341.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT|accessdate=August 11, 2011|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=March 20, 1984}}</ref><ref name=AP /> At sentencing, Judge Rudolph Pierce, who described Locke as having an "insatiable appetite" for payoffs, sentenced Locke to 7 to 10 years in [[Massachusetts Correctional Institution <U+2013> Cedar Junction|Walpole State Prison]].<ref name=AP>{{cite news|title=Barry Locke sentenced to 7<U+2013>10 years in Walpole|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HaMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n_wFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3880,3603844|accessdate=August 11, 2011|agency=Associated Press  |date=February 17, 1982}}</ref>

===In the 21st century===
By 1999, the district was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most that were served by or adjacent to commuter rail lines, though the MBTA did not assume responsibility for local service in those communities adjacent to or served by commuter rail.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

A turning point in funding occurred in 2000. Prior to July 1, 2000, the MBTA was reimbursed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all costs above revenue collected (net cost of service). Beginning on that date, the T was granted a dedicated revenue stream consisting of amounts assessed on served cities and towns, along with a dedicated 20% portion of the 5% state [[sales tax]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The MBTA now had to live within this "forward funding" budget.

The Commonwealth assigned to the MBTA responsibility for increasing public transit to compensate for increased automobile pollution from the [[Big Dig]]. The T submerged a nearby portion of the Green Line and rebuilt [[Haymarket (MBTA station)|Haymarket]] and [[North Station]]s during Big Dig construction. However, these projects have strained the MBTA's limited resources, since the Big Dig project did not include funding for these improvements. Since 1988, the MBTA has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as [[Greater Boston]] has been one of the slowest growing metropolitan areas in the United States.<ref>
{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/05/24/t_expansion_on_wrong_track/|work=The Boston Globe|title=T expansion on wrong track|date=May 24, 2006}}</ref>
When, in 2000, the MBTA's budget became limited, the agency began to run into debt from scheduled projects and obligatory Big Dig remediation work, which have now given the MBTA the highest debt of any transit authority in the country. In an effort to compensate, rates underwent an appreciable hike on January 1, 2007. Increasingly, local advocacy groups are calling on the state to assume $2.9 billion of the authority's now approximate debt of $9 billion, the interest on which severely limits funds available for required projects.<ref>[http://www.masspirg.org/news-releases/transportation-agenda/transportation-agenda/legislators-advocacy-groups-and-t-riders-call-for-mbta-debt-relief Legislators, Advocacy Groups and T Riders Call for MBTA Debt Relief - MASSPIRG]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}

With the 2004 replacement of the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] with a subway connection, the only remaining [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]]s are a short portion of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] between Andrew Station (once the train exits the tunnel beyond Andrew Station going southbound) and proceeding southbound to either Ashmont Station on the Ashmont line or Braintree Station on the Braintree line, and a short portion of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] between [[Science Park (MBTA station)|Science Park]] and [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]].

In 2006, the creation of the [[MetroWest Regional Transit Authority]] saw [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]], [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Ashland]], [[Sherborn, Massachusetts|Sherborn]], [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]], [[Holliston, Massachusetts|Holliston]], and [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]] subtract their MWRTA assessment from their MBTA assessment. Communities that are also members of other RTAs such as CATA, MVRTA, LRTA, WRTA, [[Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority|GATRA]], and BAT may also subtract their RTA assessment from their MBTA assessment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The amount of funding the MBTA received remained the same; the assessment on remaining cities and towns increased but is still allocated by the same formula.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

On October 31, 2007 the MBTA reestablished [[Greenbush Line|commuter rail service to the Greenbush section]] of [[Scituate, Massachusetts|Scituate]], the third branch of the [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/11/01/high_hopes_ride_greenbush_rails/ |title=High hopes aboard as Greenbush commuter train gets rolling - The Boston Globe |work=Boston.com |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref>
Rail renovation on the [[Green Line "D" Branch]] took place in the summer of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} New, low-floor cars on the line were introduced on December 1, 2008.

In 2008, [[Daniel Grabauskas]] (then the MBTA General Manager), revealed that the MBTA cut trips from published train and bus schedules without informing passengers, referred to as <U+201C>hidden service cuts<U+201D>, saying this misrepresentation of service had been happening for years. Grabauskas said this practice has been ended.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herald |first=Boston |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/news/regional/general/view.bg?articleid=1073870&srvc=home&position=rated |title=Bus-ted: T lied to cut costs - BostonHerald.com |publisher=News.bostonherald.com |date=2008-02-16 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

On May 28, 2008, a westbound trolley on the [[Green Line "D" Branch]] slammed into a stopped train between the [[Waban (MBTA station)|Waban]] and [[Woodland (MBTA station)|Woodland]] stations shortly after 6 p.m. At least seven people were injured, and the operator of the moving train, Terrese Edmonds, 24, was killed.<ref>

Immediately following the Boston Marathon Bombings on April 15, 2013 the MBTA was partially shut down and National Guardsmen were deployed in various stations around the city. <ref>http://www.army.mil/article/102044/Soldiers_deploy_to_MBTA_subway_stations_following_the_Boston_Marathon_bombing</ref> During the ensuing manhunt for Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev the MBTA was fully shut down until the stay-inside request for Watertown, Cambridge, Belmont, and Boston was lifted. During the manhunt, MBTA buses were used to ferry police around the city. After the suspect was caught the MBTA resumed normal service. The next day the MBTA began displaying "BOSTON STRONG" and "WE ARE ONE BOSTON" on buses and subway cars, in addition to the destination that is normally displayed.

===Buses===
{{Main|MBTA Bus}}

The [[MBTA bus]] system is the nation's [[List of United States local bus agencies by ridership|seventh largest by ridership]] and comprises over 150 routes across the [[Greater Boston]] area. The area served by the MBTA's bus operations corresponds to that served by the subway, but is significantly smaller than that served by MBTA's commuter rail operation. Seven other regional transit authorities also provide bus services within that larger area, these being [[Brockton Area Transit Authority]], [[Cape Ann Transportation Authority]], [[Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority]], [[Lowell Regional Transit Authority]], [[Merrimack Valley Regional Transit Authority]], [[Montachusett Regional Transit Authority]], and [[Worcester Regional Transit Authority]]. All of these authorities have their own fare structures and subcontract operation to private bus companies, but in many cases their buses serve as feeders to the MBTA commuter rail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eot.state.ma.us/downloads/chap196/MBTAreport.pdf|title=Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, Regional Transit Authorities Coordination and Efficiencies Report|format= PDF|publisher=Massachusetts Executive Office of Transportation|accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>

[[Image:MBTA NABI.jpg|thumb|A typical [[NABI]] CNG bus]]
Within MBTA's bus service area, transfers ''from'' the subway are [[Free transfer (transport)|free]] if using a [[CharlieCard]] (for local buses); transfers ''to'' the subway require paying the difference between bus and the higher subway fare (for local buses; if not using a CharlieCard, full subway fare must be paid in addition to full bus fare). Bus-to-bus transfers (for local buses) are free unless paying cash. Many of the outlying routes run express along major highways to downtown. The buses are colored yellow on maps and in station decor.

The [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] is the MBTA's first service designated as [[bus rapid transit]], even though it lacks many of the characteristics of bus rapid transit. The first segment, replacing the 49 bus, which in turn replaced the [[Washington Street Elevated]] section of the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]], began operations in 2002, with free transfers to the subways downtown until January 1, 2007, when the fare system was revised. The "Washington Street" segment runs along various downtown streets, and mostly in dedicated [[bus lane]]s on [[Washington Street (Boston)|Washington Street]] itself. It is categorized as a "bus" service for fare purposes.<ref name="mbta-fare">{{cite web|url=http://mbta.com/fares_and_passes/subway/ |title=> Fare and Pass Information for Subway Service |publisher=MBTA.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

[[Image:Trolleybus4120.Harvard.agr.JPG|thumb|right|Route {{MBTABus|71}} [[trackless trolley]]]]The "Waterfront" section opened at the end of 2004, and connects [[South Station]] to [[South Boston]], partly via a tunnel and partly on the surface. These buses run dual-mode, [[Trolleybus|trackless trolley]] in the tunnel and [[Diesel engine|diesel]] bus outside. Service to [[Logan Airport]] began in June 2005. The Waterfront segment is classified as a "subway" for fare purposes.<ref name="mbta-fare" />

A third, tunneled segment is proposed to connect the two lines for through service. Currently a transfer between phases is possible at South Station. "Phase 3" is controversial due to its high cost and the fact that many do not consider Phase I to be adequate replacement service for the old Elevated.

Current plans include more bus rapid transit routes, including the [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring]], intended to expand upon existing Crosstown Buses.

The MBTA contracts with private bus companies to provide subsidized service on certain routes outside of the usual fare structure. These are known collectively as the HI-RIDE Commuter Bus service, and are not numbered or mapped in the same way as integral bus services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/private_bus/ |title=> Schedules & Maps > Private Bus |publisher=MBTA |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

[[Boston-area trackless trolleys|Four routes]] connecting to [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard Station]] (Red Line) still run as [[Trolleybus|trackless trolleys]]; there was once a much larger trackless trolley system.<ref>[http://www.ieeeboston.org/mbta/mbta_milestone.htm Power System of Boston<U+2019>s Rapid Transit]{{dead link|date=June 2012}} -- Its Development, Historic Significance and Contributions, by Gilmore Cooke: IEEE Milestone Presentation</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}

In FY2005, there were on average 363,500 weekday boardings of MBTA-operated buses and trackless trolleys (not including the Silver Line), or 31.8% of the MBTA system. Another 4,400 boardings (0.38%) occurred on subsidized bus routes operated by private carriers.<ref name="journey.2-8" />

===Subway===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Boston transportation]] -->

[[Image:Redlineatdowntown.jpg|thumb|right|[[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Downtown Crossing (MBTA station)|Downtown Crossing]].]]
The subway system has three [[rapid transit]] lines<U+2014>the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]], [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] Lines, and two [[light rail]] lines<U+2014>the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and the [[Ashmont<U+2013>Mattapan High Speed Line]] (designated as part of the Red Line). The system operates according to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm]], with the lines running between central Boston and its environs. All four colored lines meet downtown at a square configuration, and the Orange and Green Lines (which run parallel) meet directly at two stations. The Red Line has two branches in the south<U+2014>[[Ashmont (MBTA station)|Ashmont]] and [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], named after their [[terminal station]]s. The portion from Harvard to Park Street Under represented the city's first rapid transit subway, 1912. The Green Line has four branches in the west<U+2014>[[Green Line "B" Branch|"B"]] ([[Boston College (MBTA station)|Boston College]]), [[Green Line "C" Branch|"C"]] ([[Cleveland Circle and Reservoir (MBTA stations)|Cleveland Circle]]), [[Green Line "D" Branch|"D"]] ([[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]]) and [[Green Line "E" Branch|"E"]] ([[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]]). The Green Line's underground [[Tremont Street Subway|section between Park Street Station and Boylston Street]] at the [[Boston Common]] was the first subway line in the United States, in 1897. The [[Green Line "A" Branch|"A" Branch]] formerly went to [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]], filling in the north-to-south letter assignment pattern, and the [[Green Line "E" Branch|"E" Branch]] formerly continued beyond Heath Street to [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]]. The colors were assigned on August 26, 1965 in conjunction with design standards developed by [[Cambridge Seven Associates]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c7a.com/Portfolio/transportation/mbta_modernization.asp?pos=0# |title=Cambridge Seven Associates Website |publisher=C7a.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> and have served as the primary identifier for the lines since the 1964 reorganization of the MTA into the MBTA.

In [[fiscal year|FY]]2005, there were on average 628,400 weekday boardings on the rapid transit and light rail lines (including the Silver Line Bus Rapid Transit), or 55.0% of the MBTA system.<ref name="journey.2-8">[http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/resources/plan/plan.htm Journey to 2030]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}.

The Orange Line is so named because it used to run down Orange Street (now lower Washington Street), the Green Line because it runs adjacent to parts of the [[Emerald Necklace]], the Blue Line because it runs under [[Boston Harbor]], and the Red Line because its northernmost station used to be at [[Harvard University]], whose school color is crimson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardsquare.com/History/Glimpses/Transportation.aspx|title=Transportation History|publisher=Harvard Square Business Association|author=Kleespies, Gavin W. and MacDonald, Katie|accessdate=4 October 2011}}</ref>

The three rapid transit lines are incompatible; trains of one line would have to be modified to run on another. Orange and Blue Line trains are similar enough that modification of some Blue Line trains for operation on the Orange Line was considered, although ultimately rejected for cost reasons; some of the new Blue Line cars from [[Siemens|Siemens Transportation]] were tested on the Orange Line after hours before acceptance for revenue service on the Blue Line. There are no direct track connections between lines, except between the Red Line and Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line, but all except the Blue Line have unused connections to the [[national rail network]], which have been used for deliveries.<ref>[http://groups-beta.google.com/group/ne.transportation/browse_frm/thread/eec051cb217f82b3/1b00f0e9d284a6e4 here we go]. The Red Line connection is at [[JFK/UMass (MBTA station)|JFK/UMass]], the Orange Line at [[Wellington (MBTA station)|Wellington]] (last used ca. 1981), and the Green Line at [[Riverside (MBTA station)|Riverside]]. Trucks may also be used to deliver train cars from the manufacturer. http://groups-beta.google.com/group/ne.transportation/browse_frm/thread/e6ba611be5abb7a/6c500ca982d60b28</ref>

A segment of Green Line tunnel from Park Street opened in 1897, making it the first subway in the United States. The downtown portions of what are now the Green, Orange, Blue, and Red lines were all in service by 1912. Additions to the rapid transit network occurred in most decades of the 1900s, and continue in the 2000s with the addition of Silver Line [[bus rapid transit]] and planned Green Line expansion.

===Commuter rail===
{{Main|MBTA Commuter Rail}}
[[Image:Mbtaworcester.jpg|thumb|EMD F40PH-2C Diesel Electric Locomotives of MBTA Commuter trains await their use in Worcester Mass.]][[Image:Mbta district.svg|thumb|Commuter rail lines service the eastern third of the state]]
The [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] system is a [[regional rail]] network that shares its tracks with [[Amtrak|inter-city passenger]] and [[freight train]]s. In 2007, the system was composed of twelve lines, three of which have branches, and another branch provides access to [[Gillette Stadium]] for special events in or near [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]]. The rail network operates according to a [[spoke-hub distribution paradigm]], with the lines running radially outward from the city of Boston. Eight of the lines converge at [[South Station]], with four of these passing through [[Back Bay (MBTA station)|Back Bay]] station. The other four converge at [[North Station]]. [[Amtrak]] uses two of the south-side lines and one of the north-side lines for long-distance intercity service. The Commuter Rail system has used the color purple on train cars and system maps since October 8, 1974, and consequently it is sometimes called the "Purple Line."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston-online.com/subway/cat_purple_line.html |title=Purple Line: Boston subway stories |publisher=Boston-online.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

There is no passenger connection between the two sides. The opportunity for a [[North<U+2013>South Rail Link]], in association with the burying of the [[Central Artery]] in the [[Big Dig]], was furthered by designing the Big Dig tunnel to permit the construction of a rail bed below the level of the automobile roadbeds.<ref name="Assoc. for Public Transportation-Dukakis-2006-10-10 ">

Passengers continue to take the Orange Line between Back Bay and North Station, or the Red and Orange, or Red and Green Lines between South and North stations, or take a [[bus]] or [[taxicab]].

A south-side commuter rail line, the [[Greenbush Line]], recently completed construction and testing and opened for commuting on October 31, 2007. A south-side branch to [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] is in the planning stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/14467087/detail.html?taf=bos |title=Boston News, Boston, Massachusetts News and Local Headlines - WCVB.com |work=Thebostonchannel.com |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref>
Track exists to extend the [[Middleborough/Lakeville Line]] to restore passenger service to [[Cape Cod]], formerly part of the [[Old Colony Railroad]] lines.

Each commuter rail line has up to nine fare zones (previously ten on some lines), numbered 1A and 1 through 8. Riders are charged based on the number of zones they travel through. Tickets can be purchased on the train or at designated ticket vendor locations near major stations, such as the [[Anderson Regional Transportation Center]]. If a local vendor is available, riders must purchase a ticket before boarding to avoid a surcharge. Fares range from $1.70 to $7.75, with multi-ride and monthly passes available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/rail/ |title=Fare and Pass Information for Commuter Rail Service |publisher=Mbta.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> In FY2005, there were on average 135,900 weekday boardings, which was 11.9% of the MBTA system as a whole.<ref name="journey.2-8" />

The MBTA commuter rail network was the first in the nation to offer free [[Wi-Fi]] onboard trains. MBTA recommends use of the service for simple web services.<ref name="mbta.com">{{cite web|url=http://mbta.com/riding_the_t/wifi/ |title=> Riding the T > Wi-Fi Commuter Rail Connect |publisher=MBTA |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> After a successful test on the Framingham/Worcester line, the MBTA has been increasing Internet connectivity for passengers. It now offers at least two wi-fi-enabled coaches per train with the hopes of adding access to the other coaches by the end of the 2010.<ref name="mbta.com"/>

===Ferries===
[[Image:MBTA boat 2.JPG|thumb|right|Commuter boat from [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] approaching the dock at [[Long Wharf (Boston)|Long Wharf]]]]
{{Main|MBTA boat}}

The [[MBTA Boat]] system comprises several [[ferry]] routes via [[Boston Harbor]]. One of these is an inner harbor service, linking the downtown waterfront with the [[Boston Navy Yard]] in [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]]. The other routes are commuter routes, linking downtown to [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]]. Some commuter services operate via [[Logan International Airport]].

All boat services are operated by [[private sector]] companies under contract to the MBTA. In FY2005, the MBTA boat system carried 4,650 passengers (0.41% of total MBTA passengers) per weekday.<ref name="journey.2-8" /> The service is provided through contract of the MBTA by Boston Harbor Cruises (BHC) and Water Transportation Alternatives, Inc. (WTAI) under the name Boston's Best Cruises.

===Paratransit===
{{Main|MBTA accessibility}}

The MBTA contracts out operation of THE RIDE, an on-demand pickup and dropoff service for people with mobility challenges. [[Paratransit]] services carry 5,400 passengers on a typical weekday, or 0.47% of the MBTA system.<ref name="journey.2-8" /><ref>[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/regionalitsarchitecture/bostonv5/web/el/el_88.htm Paratransit Dispatches in Massachusetts], Executive Office of Transportation (EOT)</ref> The three private service providers under contractual agreement with the MBTA for THE RIDE service are: Greater Lynn Senior Services (GLSS),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glss.net/ |title=Greater Lynn Senior Services |publisher=Glss.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> Veterans Transportation LLC,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://handyline.veteranstheride.com/handyline/jnot/trip_book_faq_general.oci?page=van |title=Veterans Transportation LLC |publisher=Handyline.veteranstheride.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> and The Joint Venture of TTI/YCN, LLC..<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jv-theride.com/ |title=TTI/YCN Joint Venture, LLC (A joint venture of TTI and YCN Transportation, Inc.) |publisher=Jv-theride.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

===Parking===
The MBTA operates [[park and ride]] facilities at many outlying stations, with a total capacity of almost 46,000 automobiles. The number of spaces at stations with parking varies from a few dozen to over 2,500. The larger lots and garages are usually near a major highway exit. Lots often fill up during the morning [[rush hour]]. There are some 22,000 spaces on the southern portion of the commuter rail system, 9,400 on the northern portion and 14,600 at subway stations. The parking fee for a day was raised by $2 on November 15, 2008, to $7 at subway parking garages, $5<U+2013>6 at subway surface lots, $4 at commuter rail surface lots, and $3 at commuter ferry lots. Most stations also have parking racks for [[bicycle]]s. Management for a number of parking lots owned by the MBTA are managed by LAZ Parking Limited, LLC.<ref>[http://www.lazparking.com/news/index.cfm?0A154541515D6D020473784545 MBTA Press Release], November 19, 2007</ref>

====Pay by Phone====
Customers parking in MBTA-owned and operated lots with existing cash honor boxes can pay for parking online or via phone while in their cars or once they board a train, bus, or commuter boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mbta.com/riding_the_t/parking/?id=16205 |title=MBTA Pay By Phone FAQs |publisher=Mbta.com |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.parkmobile.com/landing/mbta/ |title=MBTA Pay-By-Phone website |publisher=Us.parkmobile.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

====Zipcar====
From time to time the MBTA has made various agreements with companies that contribute to commuting options. One company the MBTA selected was [[Zipcar]]; the MBTA currently provides Zipcar with a limited number of parking spaces at various subway stations throughout the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=11279&month=&year= |title=mbta.com |publisher=mbta.com |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

[[Image:MBTA-WTCstationTicketMachine&Gates.agr.jpg|thumb|Ticket machines and fare gates at the [[World Trade Center (MBTA station)|World Trade Center]] station on the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]].]]
{{See also|CharlieCard}}
Beginning July 1, 2012, rapid transit trips (including rides on the Green Line) cost $2.00 for [[CharlieCard]] holders, $2.50 for CharlieTicket or cash payers. Bus and trackless trolley fares are $1.50 for CharlieCard holders, $2.00 for others. Persons using CharlieCards can transfer free from a subway to a bus, and from a bus to a subway for the $0.50 difference in price. CharlieTicket holders can transfer free between buses, but not from a subway to a bus. Cash payers may only transfer between subway lines, as well as to and from the Silver Line Washington Street, since it's considered Bus Rapid Transit. (Example: '''Can''' transfer from Red to Silver Line at South Station; '''Can''' transfer from Green to Silver at Boylston St; '''Cannot''' transfer from Green Line to #1 bus at Hynes).<ref>http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/</ref>

Discounted fares ($1.00 for the subway and $0.75 for local buses) as well as discounted ($28) monthly local bus and subway passes are available to seniors over 65, and persons who are permanently disabled who utilize a special photo Charlie Card (called "Senior ID" and "Transportation Access Pass", respectively). Holders of these passes are also entitled to 50% off the Commuter Rail. Persons who are legally blind ride for free on all MBTA services (including express buses and the Commuter Rail) with Blind Access Card.<ref>{{cite web|author=617-222-5854 |url=http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/reduced_fare_programs/ |title=Reduced Fares for Children, Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Mbta.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

Children 11 and under ride for free with an adult, and students aged 12<U+2013>17 receive a 50% discount on fares (or a monthly link pass for $25 Monday-Friday or $28 for no day restrictions) until 11 pm on school days. Student discounts require a Student Charlie Card issued through the holder's school and is good until around the time when school vacation begins.<ref>{{cite web|author=617-222-5854 |url=http://www.mbta.com/fares_and_passes/reduced_fare_programs/ |title=Reduced Fares for Children, Students, Seniors, and Persons with Disabilities |publisher=Mbta.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

The MBTA began collecting fares for outbound trips originating on the surface part of the Green Line on January 1, 2007. The 2007 fare increase also eliminated exit fares at certain Red Line stops and ended higher fares at inbound stops on the outer part of the Green Line "D" Branch.

Monthly passes have been in use since the late 1980s. The MBTA also sells one- and seven-day passes intended for use by visitors. These visitor passes begin from the exact time of purchase at the vending machine. However, for large orders, these visitor passes can be ordered with an exact date if purchased through the MBTA bulk sales in advance.

The fare system, including on-board and in-station fare vending machines, was purchased from [[Germany|German]]-based Scheidt and Bachmann, which developed the technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scheidt-bachmann.com/ |title=Scheidt and Bachmann (S&B) |publisher=Scheidt-bachmann.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> The Charlie Cards were developed by Gemalto<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gemalto.com/php/pr_view.php?id=149 |title=Gemalto Press Release: Gemalto to Provide 3.5 Million Transit Payment Devices to Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority |publisher=Gemalto.com |date=2007-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref> and later by Giesecke & Devrient.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS136568+30-Jan-2008+BW20080130 G&D Delivers Next Generation CharlieCard to MBTA], Reuters News</ref>

Since the "forward funding" reform in 2000, the MBTA is funded primarily through 16% of the state sales tax (with minimum dollar amount guarantee), which is set at 6.25% state-wide. The authority is also funded by passenger fares and formula assessments of the cities and towns in its service area (excepting those which are assessed for the [[MetroWest Regional Transit Authority]]). Supplemental income is obtained from its parking lots (reserved for passengers), renting space to retail vendors in and around stations, rents from utility companies using MBTA rights of way, selling surplus land and movable property, advertising on vehicles and properties, and federal operating subsidies for special programs.

The FY2008 budget includes $1,037M for operating expenses and $374M in debt and lease payments.

The Capital Investment Program is a rolling 5-year plan which programs capital expenses. The draft FY2009-2014 CIP<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/Financials/Z%209-14%20Draft%20CIP.pdf |title=Draft Capital Investment Program, FY2009 <U+2013> FY2014|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> allocates $3,795M, including $879M in projects funded from non-MBTA state sources (required for [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] compliance), and $299M in projects with one-time federal funding from the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Capital projects are paid for by federal grants, allocations from the general budget of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (for legal commitments and expansion projects) and MBTA bonds (which are paid off through the operating budget).

The FY2010 budget was supplemented by $160 million in sales tax revenue when the statewide rate was raised from 5% to 6.25%, to avoid service cuts or a fare increase in a year when deferred debt payments were coming due.<ref>http://www.mbtaadvisoryboard.org/Reports/FY10_Supp%28Sept09%29.pdf {{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}

===Capital improvements and planning process===
{{further2|[[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]]}}

The Boston [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] is responsible for overall regional surface transportation planning. As required by federal law for projects to be eligible for federal funding (except [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]s), the MPO maintains a fiscally constrained 20+ year Regional Transportation Plan for surface transportation expansion, the current edition of which is called ''Journey to 2030''. The required 4-year MPO plan is called the Transportation Improvement Plan.

The MBTA maintains its own 25-year capital planning document, called the Program for Mass Transportation, which is fiscally unconstrained. The agency's 4-year plan is called the Capital Improvement Plan; it is the primary mechanism by which money is actually allocated to capital projects. Major capital spending projects must be approved by the MBTA Board, and except for unexpected needs, are usually included in the initial CIP.

In addition to federal funds programmed through the Boston MPO, and MBTA capital funds derived from fares, sales tax, municipal assessments, and other minor internal sources, the T receives funding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for certain projects. The state may fund items in the [[State Implementation Plan]] (SIP) - such as the Big Dig mitigation projects - which is the plan required under the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution. (As of 2007, all of Massachusetts is designated as a clean air "non-attainment" zone.)

In 2005, the administration of then-governor [[Mitt Romney]] announced a long range transportation plan that emphasized repair and maintenance over expansion.

Due to the financial constraints on the MBTA budget, it is expected that funds for all further expansion projects will be funded with money outside the MBTA's budget. A state transportation bond bill is currently being used to fund the Green Line extension to [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], and planning for commuter rail service to [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].

===Projects underway and future plans===
====Blue Line====
{{see also2|[[Blue Line (MBTA)#Future plans|Blue Line Future plans]]}}
[[File:Revere_to_Lynn_Blue_Line_Extension.jpg|thumb|right|Potential connecting route for Blue Line Extension from Revere to Lynn]]
There is a proposal to extend the Blue Line northward to [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], with two potential extension routes having been identified. One proposed path would run through marshland alongside the existing [[Newburyport/Rockport Line|Newburyport/Rockport commuter rail line]], while the other would extend the line along the remainder of the [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad|BRB&L]] right of way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/pmt-old/PMT-3.pdf|title=Chapter 5C System Expansion|accessdate=14 October 2007|format=PDF|work=MBTA Program for Mass Transportation }}</ref> Construction is expected to begin in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynndevelopment.com/dei_3_10_04.htm|title=Blue Line Rolling into Lynn|first=Thor|last=Jourgensen|publisher=Lynn Office of Economic and Community Development|date=10 March 2005}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>{{dead link|date=June 2012}}

In addition, the MBTA has committed to designing an extension of the line's southern terminus westward to [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], where it would connect with the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]].<ref name=RedBlue>{{cite web|title=Red Line Blue Line Connector|url=http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=RedBlueFact>{{cite web|title=Red Line Blue Line Connector Factsheet|url=http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/downloads/FactSheet2_050310.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref> This was one of the mitigation measures the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] agreed to as part of the [[Big Dig]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/11/30/state_agrees_to_design_link_between_red_and_blue_lines/|title=State agrees to design link between Red and Blue lines|first=Mac|last=Daniels|accessdate=14 October 2007|work=The Boston Globe|date=30 November 2006}}</ref>

====Green Line====
{{see also2|[[Green Line (MBTA)#Future plans|Green Line Future plans]]}}
To settle a lawsuit with the [[Conservation Law Foundation]] to mitigate increased automobile emissions from the [[Big Dig]], the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to extend the Green Line north to [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], two suburbs currently under-served by the MBTA. This plan would start at a relocated [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere Station]], and terminate at [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] and [[Mystic Valley Parkway]] in Medford (on the [[Mystic River]]), by the settlement-imposed deadline of December 31, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/05/potential_green.html|title=Potential Green Line stops announced|first=Andrew|last=Ryan|publisher=Boston Globe|date=7 May 2008}}</ref> There will be an expected daily ridership of 8,420.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Metropolitan Planning Organization|title=The 2003 Program for Mass Transportation, Appendix, tables C-10 and C-11|url=http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/pmt-old/pmt.htm}}</ref>

Another mitigation project in the initial settlement was restoration of service on the [[Green Line "E" Branch|"E" Branch]] between [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] and [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway/Forest Hills]]. A revised settlement agreement resulted in the substitution of other projects with similar air quality benefits. The state Executive Office of Transportation promised to consider other transit enhancements in the Arborway corridor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaicaplaingazette.com/2007/07/20/arborway_public_transit_meetings_to_begin/|title=Arborway public transit meetings to begin|first=Andy|last=Zagastiz<U+00E1>bal|publisher=Jamaica Plain Gazette|date=20 July 2007}}</ref>

====Orange Line====
{{see also2|[[Orange Line (MBTA)#Future plans|Orange Line Future plans]]}}
[[Assembly Square (MBTA station)|Assembly Square]] is a planned new station on the MBTA's [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]]. No new rail trackage will be added, since the Orange Line already runs through the site, but a new platform will be added to allow passengers to board and disembark. The new station is tentatively scheduled to begin construction in 2011, and to open in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedlocal.com/somerville/news/x167303666/MBTA-votes-keep-Somerville-transit-projects-on-track#axzz1IxkBw6aI|title=MBTA votes keep Somerville transit projects on track|work=[[Somerville Journal]]|date=9 February 2011|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> It is being built alongside the planned [[Assembly Square]] project (which is also located right next to the [[Assembly Square Marketplace]]).

====Silver Line====
{{see also2|[[Silver Line (MBTA)#Future plans|Silver Line Future plans]]}}
[[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] Phase III comprises the connection of the two halves of the Silver Line via an underground busway from [[Boylston (MBTA station)|Boylston station]] on the Green Line to [[South Station]]. An initial proposed route involved a mile long tunnel connecting separate portals located at [[Charles Street (Boston)|Charles]] and at [[Tremont Street|Tremont]] streets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/10/officials_endorse_silver_line_tunnel/?page=full|title=Officials endorse Silver Line Tunnel|publisher=Boston Globe}}</ref> The local [[Tufts Medical Center]] has vehemently protested this proposal, citing possible problems with traffic and noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/07/15/mbta_plan_way_off_track/|title=MBTA plan way off track|first=Brian|last=McGrory|date=15 July 2005|publisher=Boston Globe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/10/officials_endorse_silver_line_tunnel/|title=Officials endorse Silver Line tunnel - Some neighbors object to route|first=Mac|last=Daniel|date=10 March 2006|publisher=Boston Globe}}</ref> Environmental review and preliminary engineering were expected to be completed by the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysouthend.com/index.php?ch=news&sc=&sc2=news&sc3=&id=78529|title=Silver Line Phase III moving forward|first=Scott|last=Kearnan|publisher=MySouthEnd.com|date=7 August 2008}}</ref> A federal funding decision was expected in 2010, with possible construction starting in 2011 and ending in 2016.<ref name="all_about">{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/uploadedfiles/About_the_T/T_Projects/T_Projects_List/CH 2 -Final DEIS.pdf|title=MBTA Transit Projects: Silver Line Phase 3|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|date=May 2005}}</ref> The MBTA has been managing project planning. As of 2010, planning and construction of the Phase III tunnel has been suspended indefinitely (without any physical construction having begun) due to funding difficulties and community opposition.

====Urban Ring====
{{main|Urban Ring Project (MBTA)}}
The [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring]] is a project of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]], to develop new [[public transport]]ation routes that would provide improved circumferential connections among many existing transit lines that project radially from downtown [[Boston]], allowing easier travel between locations outside of downtown. The project corridor passes through various neighborhoods of Boston, [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]. The capital cost for this version of the plan is estimated at $2.2 billion, with a projected daily ridership of 170,000. Fifty-three percent of the route is either in a bus-only lane, dedicated busway, or tunnel.<ref name="fenway">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/06/15/lawmakers_seek_700m_for_projects_job_stimulus/|title=Lawmakers seek $700m for projects, job stimulus|publisher=Boston Globe|first=Scott|last=Helman|date=15 June 2008}}</ref> The Urban Ring would have a higher collective ridership than the Orange Line, Blue Line, or the entire commuter rail system.<ref name="fenway" />

====Commuter rail====
{{further2|[[MBTA Commuter Rail#Proposed expansions|MBTA Commuter Rail Proposed expansions]]}}
There are several proposed extension to current commuter rail lines. A controversial extension of the [[Providence/Stoughton Line|Stoughton Line]] is proposed to [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/10/28/battle_lines_drawn_again_on_rail_route/|title=Battle lines drawn again on rail route|first=Christine|last=Wallgren|publisher=Boston Globe|date=28 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eot.state.ma.us/downloads/SCR_plan040407.pdf|title=South Coast Rail Plan|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|date=4 April 2007}}</ref> Critics argue that building the extension does not make economic sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2008/03/11/news/news01.txt/|title=Area residents, officials say give aid not MBTA rail line to South Coast|first=Jim|last=Hand|publisher=Sun Chronicle|11 March 2008}}</ref>

A {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} extension of the [[Providence/Stoughton Line|Providence Line]] past [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] to [[T. F. Green Airport (MBTA station)|T. F. Green Airport]] and [[Wickford Junction (MBTA station)|Wickford Junction]] in [[Rhode Island]] opened in 2012. The [[Rhode Island Department of Transportation]] is also studying the feasibility of serving existing Amtrak stations in [[Kingston (Amtrak station)|Kingston]] and [[Westerly (Amtrak station)|Westerly]] as well as constructing new stations in [[Cranston, Rhode Island|Cranston]], [[East Greenwich, Rhode Island|East Greenwich]], and [[Davisville, Rhode Island|West Davisville]].

In September 2009, [[CSX Transportation]] and the commonwealth finalized a $100 million agreement to purchase CSX's [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] tracks, as well as some other track, to improve service on the Framingham/Worcester Line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/framingham/articles/2009/09/24/deal_expected_to_boost_commuter_rail_service/|title=Deal expected to boost commuter rail service,|work=Boston Globe|first=Noah|last=Bierman|date=September 24, 2009}}</ref> A liability issue that had held up the agreement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/04/10/no_fault_no_way_csx_told/|title=No fault?

There is also a plan to upgrade the [[Fitchburg Line]] to have [[cab signaling]] and to construct a second track along a seven-mile (11&nbsp;km) stretch near [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]] which is shared with freight traffic, so that the [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]] to Boston trip will be able to take only about an hour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20071130/NEWS/711300676/1116/|title=$150M smile for MBTA|publisher=Worcester Telegram & Gazette|first=John J.|last=Monahan|date=30 November 2007}}</ref>

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in 2005 to make improvements on the [[Fairmount Line]] part of its legally binding commitment to mitigate increased air pollution from the [[Big Dig]]. These improvements must be complete by December 31, 2011. Four new stations will be constructed.<ref name="tproject">{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/t_projects/?id=14261|title=Fairmont Line Improvements|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts}}</ref> The total cost of the project is estimated at $79.4 million,<ref>Draft 2008-2013 MBTA Capital Improvement Plan, p. 128.</ref> and will divert 220 trips from automobiles to transit.<ref>2004 MBTA Program for Mass Transportation, Appendix, Table C-15.</ref>

No direct connection exists between North Station and South Station. A [[North<U+2013>South Rail Link]] has been proposed to unite the two halves of the commuter rail system; but, because of the high cost, Massachusetts has withdrawn its sponsorship of the proposal, in communications with the [[United States Department of Transportation]].

==Management and administration==

The MBTA has a board of directors which it shares with the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]]. The Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation leads the executive management team of MassDOT in addition to serving in the [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor's]] Cabinet. The MBTA's executive management team is led by its General Manager, who is currently also serving as the MassDOT Rail and Transit Administrator, overseeing all public transit in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/leadership/RichardDavey/ |title=> About the MBTA > Leadership |publisher=MBTA |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

The MBTA Advisory Board represents the cities and towns in the MBTA service district. The municipalities are assessed a total of $143M annually (as of FY2008). In return, the Advisory Board has veto power over the MBTA operating and capital budgets, including the power to reduce the overall amount.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbtaadvisoryboard.org/ |title=Home |publisher=MBTA Advisory Board |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>

The MBTA's Board of Directors should not be confused with a separate Board of Directors for MBCR.

===Employees and unions===
{{As of|2009}}, the MBTA employs 6,346 workers, of which roughly 600 are in part-time jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal
|title=MBTA Independent Review 11 09
|publisher=MBTA
|year=2009

Structurally, the employees of the MBTA function as part of a handful of [[trade union]]s. The largest union of the MBTA is the Carmen<U+2019>s Union (Local 589), representing bus and subway operators. This includes full and part-time bus drivers, motorpersons and streetcar motorpersons, full and part-time train attendants, and Customer Service Agents (CSAs). Further unions include the Machinists Union, Local 264; Electrical Workers Union, Local 717; the Welder's Union, Local 651; the Executive Union; the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 453; the Professional and Technical Engineers Union, Local 105; and the Office and Professional Employees Union, Local 6.

Within the authority, employees are ranked according to [[seniority]] (or "rating"). This is categorized by an employee's five-digit badge number, though some of the longest serving employees still have only four-digits. An employee's badge number indicates the relative length of employment with the MBTA; badges are issued in sequential order. The rating structure determines many different things, including the rank in which perks are to be offered to employee, such as: When offering the choice for quarter-annual route assignments ("picks"), overtime offerings, and even the rank to transfer new hires from part-time roles to a full-time role.

===Law enforcement and security===
{{Main|Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Police}}
The MBTA maintains its own police force which actively patrols all areas and vehicles used by the Authority. [[MBTA Police]] conduct routine vehicle patrol, routine foot patrol, incident investigations, and specialized patrol with K-9 dogs, and other specialized methods of explosive and narcotics detection.

The MBTA also maintains several [[closed-circuit television]] facilities located throughout its service area.<ref>[http://www.mbtaonline.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=17123&month=&year= MBTA Bus Improvement Program Complete]: MBTA Press release, May 11, 2009</ref> The cameras monitor various areas including trains stations, and MBTA vehicles throughout the system on a 24-hour basis. MBTA phone numbers pasted onto the front of the fare gates can place customers having a problem directly into contact with one of these operations centers.

==Criticism==
[[File:Occupy MBTA April 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|An "Occupy MBTA" banner outside of the [[Massachusetts State House]].]]
Ahead of the MBTA's 2009 restructuring with the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] (MassDOT), the MBTA had a total [[debenture]] of over US$ 8 billion.<ref>[http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/parking/?rn=Needham&transittype=Commuter+Rail Q&A on parking rates increase] Accessed 2009-07-10</ref> As a direct result, MBTA fares and parking fees have increased significantly.<ref>

In July 2009, the MBTA proposed a 20% fare increase and significant service cuts.<ref>[http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/?id=17721 Proposed MBTA fare increase/service reductions] Accessed 2009-09-10</ref> The MBTA has endured criticism that the increases have outpaced inflation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

When the Orange Line was realigned in the 1980s, its course was altered away from the lower income areas of [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], and [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], where residents are less likely to own cars, and depend more on public transit, toward the more affluent towns of [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], as well as sections of the [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood (where car ownership is higher, and thus, reliance on public transit is far lower). In response, the MBTA built a bus line operated by articulated silver buses equipped with specialized dispatching equipment. The MBTA named the service the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]], and classified it as though it were a rail transit service. The service has been criticized in many respects, most notably for its slow speed, and the fact that it utilizes the same roads as cars and other "street" traffic, subsequently increasing gridlock and collisions, earning it the nickname "Silver Lie" among many.<ref>[[T Rider's Union]], [http://www.ace-ej.org/tru/busmarathon Bus Marathon] (April 18, 2006).</ref>

Transportation advocates in Boston have raised the issue that residents cannot go from one outlying area to another without first riding downtown and changing lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring Project]], which would provide more circumferential service, is in the planning stages and has largely not yet been implemented due to lack of funding. This problem also occurs in the [[Washington Metro]] system, where customers cannot travel between suburbs on the same side of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] without going through downtown, and [[Chicago]]'s [[Metra]] and [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] systems, where all lines lead into and out of the central business district, rather than around it.

The T stops running at 12:45 a.m. each night, despite the fact that bars and clubs in most areas of Boston are open until 2 a.m. Like nearly all subways worldwide, the MBTA's subway does not have parallel express and local tracks, so rail maintenance can only be done when the T is not running, and "with a 109-year-old system", says the MBTA press secretary, "you have to be out there every night."<ref>"Fed Up". ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]]'', January 19<U+2013>25, 2007, p17.</ref> The T did experiment with "Night Owl" bus service from 2001 to 2005, but abandoned it on account of the $7.53 per rider cost to the MBTA to keep the service open, five times the cost per passenger of an average bus route.<ref>Tang, Lai-Yan.
