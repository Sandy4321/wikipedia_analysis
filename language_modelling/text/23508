The '''Shvetsov ASh-2''' was an 28-cylinder, air-cooled, radial [[aircraft engine]] designed in the [[Soviet Union]] in the late 1940s. It was inferior to the [[Dobrynin VD-4K]] engine and did not enter production. One of the problems was air-cooling which ate up to 50% of the total engine power at 15000 meters. In contrast, liquid-cooled VD-4K required only 5% of power for cooling at the same altitude.
