The '''Sauber C20''' was the car with which the [[Sauber]] [[Formula One]] team competed in the [[2001 Formula One season]]. It was powered by a [[Petronas]]-branded '01A' 3.0-litre V10 [http://forix.autosport.com/engine.php?l=0&r=2001000116&c=0], supplied by [[Scuderia Ferrari]]. The C20 was notable not only for its eventual position in the  Constructors' World Championship (see below), but also for the introduction of a new type of front suspension mounting: the "[[Suspension keel|twin keel]]".

== The twin keel ==
In 2000, the [[FIA]] announced a 50% increase in the minimum height of the front wing, measured from the ground to the bottom edge of the "endplate", from 100mm to 150mm. This was intended to reduce front [[Downforce|downforce]] as part of the FIA's continued commitment to control speeds in F1.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One_regulations#History] In the search for improved [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency, all Formula One teams had adopted a high nose with a pylon-mounted front wing during the 1990s, and the new regulation was intended to reduce the effectiveness of this configuration. Because the measurement was made only at the ends of the wing, most teams responded by adding either a downward curve or a step to the wing's centre section, but Sauber's solution went further.

In later iterations of this layout, the nose was normally high enough to require the addition of a [[Keel|keel]] to which the lower wishbones were mounted. A desire to optimise this aerodynamically critical area in response to the new wing height led Sauber to employ a pair of keels for the lower wishbones, with only a small brace between them for structural integrity. Among rival teams, opinion was divided. Some teams - such as [[McLaren]], [[Jordan_Grand_Prix|Jordan]] and [[Arrows]] - adopted the idea, while others - notably [[Renault_F1|Renault]] and [[Scuderia_Ferrari|Ferrari]] - declined, citing potential issues with weight, structural rigidity and crash worthiness.

More recently, McLaren developed a "zero-keel" layout in which the lower wishbones are raised and mounted directly to the nose. This restricts suspension geometry to some degree, but provides aerodynamic benefits. It has since been adopted by a number of other teams and the twin keel layout has since fallen out of favour.

== Drivers ==
In contrast to the previous season's experienced pairing of [[Mika Salo]] and [[Pedro Diniz]], Peter Sauber signed Germany's [[Nick Heidfeld]] and Finnish rookie [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]]. His lack of experience prompted some drivers and [[FIA]] officials, including Max Mosley, to question the wisdom of this decision. Heidfeld had made his debut with [[Prost Grand Prix]] in 2000, but R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen was a 21-year old whose only previous single-seater formula experience amounted to one and a half seasons in [[British Formula Renault Championship|British Formula Renault]] from 1999 to 2000, albeit culminating in a title win.

However, the young Finn's performances belied his age and lack of experience, with a point-scoring finish on his debut and a further four points-scoring finishes throughout the year. Heidfeld achieved a podium (one of six in Sauber's history)[http://forix.autosport.com/cmake.php?l=0&r=1993000129&c=51&rst=1021] with 3rd place in the [[2001_Brazilian_Grand_Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] and scored points on six other occasions.[http://forix.autosport.com/cp.php?l=0&r=2001&c=30]

== Constructors' World Championship ==
The C20 turned out to be arguably Sauber's most competitive chassis, providing Sauber with a points total of 21 and 4th place in the Constructors' World Championship standings. Sauber never equalled this result, though it came close in 2002, with 5th place.

== Finishing record ==
The C20 suffered a number of DNFs (Did Not Finish), with six mechanical failures, six driver-related incidents and one DNS (Did Not Start). They break down thus:[http://forix.autosport.com/cmake.php?l=0&x=0&r=1993000129&c=51&rca=2001000116&rst=1000]
* Three [[Driveshaft|driveshaft]] failures.
* One steering failure.
* One transmission failure.
* One suspension failure.
* One DNS.
* Three spins.
* Three collisions.
The C20 achieved 11 points finishes and 10 non-scoring finishes from 33 starts.
