The '''Darfur conflict''' is a crisis in the [[Darfur]] region of western [[Sudan]]. Unlike the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], the current lines of conflict are seen to be ethnic and tribal, rather than religious.<ref>See Wikipedia entries on the [[Fur people|Fur]] and [[Zaghawa]] as well as articles in [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-30-darfurrally_x.htm USA Today], [http://www.slate.com/id/2104814/ Slate] and the [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18674 New York Review of Books]. Additionally, the [http://www.un.org/News/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf#search=%22un%20report%20darfur%20genocide%22 Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General (PDF)], United Nations, [[25 January]] [[2005]], states: "The various tribes that have been the object of attacks and killings (chiefly the Fur, Massalit and Zaghawa tribes) do not appear to make up ethnic groups distinct from the ethnic group to which persons or militias that attack them belong. They speak the same language (Arabic) and embrace the same religion (Islam)" (p. 129).</ref> One side of the armed conflict is composed mainly of the [[military of Sudan|Sudanese military]] and the [[Janjaweed]], a [[militia]] group recruited mostly from the [[Arab]] [[Baggara]] tribes of the northern [[Rizeigat]], camel-herding [[nomads]].  The other side comprises a variety of rebel groups, notably the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]] and the [[Justice and Equality Movement]], recruited primarily from the land-tilling non-Arab [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa]], and [[Massaleit]] ethnic groups. The [[Government of Sudan|Sudanese government]], while publicly denying that it supports the Janjaweed, has provided money and assistance to the militia and has participated in joint attacks targeting the black African tribes from which the rebels draw support.<ref>{{cite news

The combination of decades of [[drought]], [[desertification]], and [[overpopulation]] are among the causes of the Darfur conflict, because the Baggara [[nomads]] searching for water have to take their livestock further south, to land mainly occupied by non-Arab farming communities.<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/db/blogs/1265/2007/06/30-100806-1.htm Looking to water to find peace in Darfur]</ref>

Sudan strongly objected to the resolution and said that it would see the UN forces in the region as foreign invaders. The next day, the [[Military of Sudan|Sudanese military]] launched a major offensive in the region.

==Background== 
{{main|History of Darfur}} 
The conflict taking place in Darfur has many interwoven causes. While rooted in structural inequality between the center of the country around the [[Nile]] and the 'peripheral' areas such as Darfur, tensions were exacerbated in the last two decades of the twentieth century by a combination of environmental calamity, non-sustainable fast [[population growth]], [[desertification]], political opportunism and regional politics<ref>{{cite book|title=Collapse|author=Diamond, Jared|isbn=0143036556|publisher=Penguin|year=2005}}</ref>. On [[June 16]], [[2007]], [[UN]] Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] released a statement in which he proposed that the [[slaughter]] in Darfur was caused "at least in part from [[climate change]]", and that it "derives, to some degree, from man-made [[global warming]]".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ban Ki-moon|title=A Climate Culprit In Darfur|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/15/AR2007061501857.html| date = [[2007-06-16]]| publisher = [[Washington Post]]|accessdate = 2007-06-23}}</ref> "''The scale of historical climate change, as recorded in Northern [[Darfur]], is almost unprecedented: the reduction in rainfall has turned millions of hectares of already marginal semi-desert grazing land into desert. The impact of climate change is considered to be directly related to the conflict in the region, as desertification has added significantly to the stress on the livelihoods of pastoralist societies, forcing them to move south to find pasture,''" the [[UNEP]] report states.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72985 Climate change - only one cause among many for Darfur conflict]</ref>

A point of particular confusion has been the characterization of the conflict as one between '[[Arab]]' and '[[African]]' populations, a [[dichotomy]] that one historian describes as "both true and false".<ref>[[G<U+00E9>rard Prunier]], ''Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide'', Cornell University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8014-4450-0, p. 4</ref><ref>{{cite news

In the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century, the [[Keira dynasty]] of the [[Fur people]] of the [[Marrah Mountains]] established a [[sultan]]ate with [[Islam]] as the [[state religion]]. The sultanate was conquered by the [[Turkiyah|Turco-Egyptian]] force expanding south along the Nile, which was in turn defeated by the [[Muhammad Ahmad]], the self-proclaimed ''[[Mahdi]]''.  The Mahdist state collapsed under the onslaught of the British force led by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], who established an [[History of the Anglo-Egyptian co-dominium|Anglo-Egyptian co-dominium]] to rule Sudan.  The British allowed Darfur ''[[de jure]]'' autonomy until 1916 when they invaded and incorporated the region into Sudan.<ref>Prunier, pp. 8-24</ref>  Within Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the bulk of resources were devoted toward [[Khartoum]] and [[Blue Nile Province]], leaving the rest of the country relatively undeveloped. 

[[Image:Darfur IDPs 1 camp.jpg|thumb|An [[internally displaced persons]] camp in [[Darfur]]]] 
The inhabitants of the Nile Valley, which had received the bulk of British investment, continued the pattern of economic and political marginalization after independence was achieved in 1956.  In the 1968 elections, factionalism within the ruling [[Umma Party (Sudan)|Umma Party]] led candidates, notably [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], to try to split off portions of the Darfuri electorate either by blaming the region's underdevelopment on the Arabs, in the case of appeals to the stationary peoples, or by appealing to the Baggara semi-nomads to support their fellow Nile Arabs. This Arab-African dichotomy, which was not an indigenously developed way of perceiving local relations, was exacerbated after [[Libya]]n President [[Muammar Gaddafi]] became focused on establishing an Arab belt across the [[Sahel]] and promulgated an ideology of Arab supremacy.<ref>Prunier, pp. 42-44</ref>  As a result of a sequence of interactions between Sudan, Libya and [[Chad]] from the late 1960s through the 1980s, including the creation of the Libyan-supported [[Islamic Legion]], Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] established Darfur as a rear base for the rebel force led by [[Hiss<U+00E8>ne Habr<U+00E9>]], which was attempting to overthrow the Chadian government and was also anti-Gaddafi.<ref>Prunier, pp. 44-47</ref>  

In 1983 and 1984, the rains failed and the region was plunged into a [[famine]].<ref>Prunier, pp. 47-52</ref>  The famine killed an estimated 95,000 people out of a population of 3.1 million. Nimeiry was overthrown on [[5 April]] [[1985]], and Sadiq al-Mahdi came out of exile, making a deal with Gaddafi, which al-Mahdi did not honor, to turn over Darfur to Libya if he was supplied with the funds to win the upcoming elections.<ref>Prunier, pp. 52-53, 56</ref>

In early [[2003]], two local rebel groups &mdash; the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) and the [[Sudan Liberation Movement]] (SLM)<ref name=SLM-POLITICAL-DECLARATION>{{cite web

The SLM, which is much larger than the JEM, is generally associated with the Fur and Masalit, as well as the Wagi clan of the Zaghawa, while the JEM is associated with the Kobe clan of Zaghawa. Later that year, leaders of both groups, the Sudanese Government and representatives of the International diplomatic community were brought together in Geneva by the [[Center for Humanitarian Dialogue]] to look at ways of addressing the humanitarian crisis. In 2004, the JEM joined the [[Eastern Front (Sudan)|Eastern Front]], a group set up in 2004 as an alliance between two eastern tribal rebel groups, the [[Rashaida]] tribe's [[Free Lions]] and the [[Beja Congress]]. The JEM has also been accused of being controlled by [[Hassan al-Turabi]].

On [[January 20]], [[2006]], SLM declared a merger with the Justice and Equality Movement to form the Alliance of Revolutionary Forces of West Sudan. However, in May of that year, the SLM and JEM were again negotiating as separate entities.

==History of the conflict, 2003-2007==
{{Darfur conflict}}


The starting point of the conflict in the Darfur region is typically said to be [[26 February]] [[2003]], when a group calling itself the [[Darfur Liberation Front]] (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on [[Golo]], the headquarters of [[Jebel Marra]] District.  Even prior to this attack, however, a conflict had erupted in Darfur, as rebels had already attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys, and the government had engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the [[Marrah Mountains]].  The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on the mountain on [[25 February]] [[2002]] and the Sudanese government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002.  Chroniclers Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]] state that the beginning of the rebellion is better dated to [[21 July]] [[2001]], when a group of Zaghawa and [[Fur people|Fur]] met in [[Abu Gamra]] and swore oaths on the [[Qur'an]] to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages.<ref>Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]], ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', Zed Books, London March 2006, ISBN 1-84277-697-5, p. 76-77</ref> It should be noted that nearly all of the residents of Darfur are [[Muslim]], as are the [[Janjaweed]] and the government leaders in [[Khartoum]].<ref>Ibid.,  [http://www.un.org/News/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf#search=%22un%20report%20darfur%20genocide%22 Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General (PDF)], United Nations, [[25 January]] [[2005]], p. 129.</ref>

[[25 March]], the rebels seized the garrison town of [[Tine, Sudan|Tine]] along the Chadian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms.  Despite a threat by President [[Omar al-Bashir]] to "unleash" the army, the military had little in reserve.  The army was already deployed both to the south, where the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] was drawing to an end, and the east, where rebels sponsored by [[Eritrea]] were threatening the newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to [[Port Sudan]].  The rebel tactic of hit-and-run raids to speed across the semi-desert region proved almost impossible for the army, untrained in desert operations, to counter.  However, its aerial bombardment of rebel positions on the mountain was devastating.<ref>Flint and de Waal, p. 99</ref>

At 5:30 am on [[25 April]] [[2003]], a joint [[Sudan Liberation Army]] (SLA) and JEM force in 33 Land Cruisers entered [[al-Fashir]] and attacked the sleeping garrison. In the next four hours, four Antonov bombers and helicopter gunships, according to the government, (seven according to the rebels) were destroyed on the ground,  75 soldiers, pilots and technicians were killed and 32 were captured, including the commander of the air base, a [[Major General]].  The success of the raid was unprecedented in Sudan; in the 20 years of the war in the south, the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) had never carried out such an operation.<ref>Flint and de Waal, pp. 99-100</ref>  

===Enter the Janjaweed (2003)===
[[Image:Darfur IDPs children sitting.jpg|thumb|[[Internally displaced person]]s camp]]
The al-Fashir raid was a turning point both militarily and psychologically.  The armed forces had been humiliated by the al-Fashir raid and the government was faced with a difficult strategic situation.  The armed forces would clearly need to be retrained and redeployed to fight this new kind of war and there were well-founded concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the army.  Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese [[Military Intelligence]]. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, the rebels won 34 of 38 engagements.  In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at [[Kutum]], killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners and in mid-July, 250 were killed in a second attack on Tine.  The SLA began to infiltrate farther east, threatening to extend the war into [[Kordofan]].

However, at this point the government changed its strategy.  Given that the army was being consistently defeated, the war effort depended on three elements: Military Intelligence, the air force, and the [[Janjaweed]], armed [[Baggara]] herders whom the government had begun directing in repression of a [[Masalit]] uprising in 1996-1999.  The Janjaweed were put at the center of the new counter-insurgency strategy.  Military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a [[paramilitary]] force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery.  The military planners were doubtlessly aware of the probable consequences of such a strategy<U+2014>similar methods undertaken in the [[Nuba Mountains]] and around the southern oil fields during the 1990's had resulted in massive human rights violations and [[forced displacement]]s.<ref>Flint and de Waal, pp. 60, 101-103</ref>

The better-armed Janjaweed quickly gained the upper hand. By the spring of 2004, several thousand people &mdash; mostly from the non-Arab population &mdash; had been killed and as many as a million more had been driven from their homes, causing a major humanitarian crisis in the region. The crisis took on an international dimension when over 100,000 refugees poured into neighbouring [[Chad]], pursued by Janjaweed militiamen, who clashed with Chadian government forces along the border. More than 70 militiamen and 10 Chadian soldiers were killed in one gun battle in April. A [[United Nations]] observer team reported that non-Arab villages were singled out while Arab villages were left untouched: 
[[Image:Villages destroyed in the Darfur Sudan 2AUG2004.jpg|thumb|Destroyed villages [[as of 2004|as of August 2004]] ]]
<blockquote>The 23 Fur villages in the Shattaya Administrative Unit have been completely depopulated, looted and burnt to the ground (the team observed several such sites driving through the area for two days). Meanwhile, dotted alongside these charred locations are unharmed, populated and functioning Arab settlements. In some locations, the distance between a destroyed Fur village and an Arab village is less than 500 meters.<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64DKD6?OpenDocument United Nations Inter-Agency Fact Finding and Rapid Assessment Mission: Kailek Town, South Darfur], United Nations Resident Coordinator, [[25 April]] [[2004]]</ref></blockquote>

In 2004, Chad brokered negotiations in [[N'Djamena]], leading to the [[April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement]] between the Sudanese government, JEM, and SLM.  A group splintered from the JEM in April &mdash; the [[National Movement for Reform and Development]] &mdash; which did not participate in the April cease-fire talks or agreement.  Janjaweed and rebel attacks have continued since the ceasefire.  The [[African Union]] (AU) formed a [[Ceasefire Commission]] (CFC) to monitor observance of the putative ceasefire.  

The scale of the crisis led to warnings of an imminent disaster, with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] warning that the risk of genocide is frighteningly real in Darfur. The scale of the Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the [[Rwandan Genocide]], a parallel hotly denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which include dismemberment and killing of noncombatants and even young children and babies, are more akin to the [[ethnic cleansing]] used in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] but have warned that the region's remoteness means that hundreds of thousands are effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based [[International Crisis Group]] reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of [[starvation]] and disease.<ref name="'Dozens killed'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3741875.stm 'Dozens killed' in Sudan attack] (BBC) [[24 May]] [[2004]]</ref>

On [[10 July]] [[2005]], Ex-SPLA leader [[John Garang]] was sworn in as Sudan's vice-president.<ref name="ex-rebel joins government">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4666701.stm  Sudan ex-rebel joins government] (BBC) [[10 July]] [[2005]]</ref>  However, on [[30 July]] [[2005]], Garang died in a helicopter crash.<ref name="garang killed">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4733571.stm Sudan VP Garang killed in crash] (BBC) [[1 August]] [[2005]]</ref>  His death had long-term implications and, despite improved security, talks between the various rebels in the Darfur region went slowly.

An attack on the Chadian town of [[Adre]] near the Sudanese border led to the deaths of three hundred rebels in December 2005. Sudan was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days.<ref name="Chad fightback">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4544352.stm Chad fightback 'kills 300 rebels'] (BBC) [[20 December]] [[2005]]</ref> The escalating tensions in the region led to the [[Politics of Chad|government of Chad]] declaring its hostility toward Sudan and calling for Chadian citizens to mobilise themselves against the "common enemy".<ref name="Chad in 'state of war'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm Chad in 'state of war' with Sudan] By Stephanie Hancock, BBC News, [[N'Djamena]], [[23 December]] [[2005]]</ref> (See [[Chad-Sudan conflict]])

===May Agreement (2006)===
[[Image:Minni Minnawi and George W Bush (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Minni Minnawi]] was granted a press opportunity with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] after signing the May agreement.]]

On [[May 5]], [[2006]], the government of [[Sudan]] signed an accord with the faction of the SLA led by [[Minni Minnawi]]. However, the agreement was rejected by two other, smaller groups, the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] and a rival faction of the SLA.<ref name="Main Rebel Group Sign">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/05/AR2006050500305.html |title=Sudan, Main Rebel Group Sign Peace Deal |author=Kessler, Glenn and Emily Wax |date=2006, May 5 |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>  The accord was orchestrated by the [[United States Department of State|U.S.]] [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Robert B.

===July-August 2006===
During [[July 2006|July]] and [[August 2006]], fighting had been renewed, "threatening to shut down the world's largest aid operation" as international aid organizations considered leaving due to attacks against their personnel. [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] called for bringing a force of 18,000 international [[Department of Peacekeeping Operations|peacekeepers]] to the region in order to replace the [[African Union]] force of 7,000 ([[African Union Mission in Sudan|AMIS]]).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5239116.stm "Annan outlines Darfur peace plans"], BBC, [[August 2]], [[2006]]</ref><ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-08-09-voa33.cfm "Disagreements Over Darfur Peace Plan Spark Conflict"], ''[[Voice of America]]'', [[August 9]], [[2006]]</ref> In July 2006 at the Darfur town of [[Kalma, Sudan|Kalma]], seven women, who ventured out of a refugee camp to gather firewood, were gang-raped, beaten and robbed by the Janjaweed.

===Implementation failure (September 2006)===
On [[September 8]], [[2006]], [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Guterres]], head of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], said Darfur faces a "humanitarian catastrophe."<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-09-08T090839Z_01_L0866016_RTRUKOC_0_US-SUDAN-DARFUR-REFUGEES.xml&archived=False "U.N. refugee chief warns of Darfur "catastrophe"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[September 8]], 2006</ref> On [[September 12]], [[2006]], Sudan's [[European Union]] envoy Pekka Haavisto claimed that the Sudanese army is "bombing civilians in Darfur".<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12836278.htm "Sudan bombing civilians in Darfur - EU envoy"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[September 12]], 2006</ref> A [[World Food Program]] official reported that food aid has been cut off from at least 355,000 people in the region.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200609/12/eng20060912_302059.html "Violence in Darfur cuts off 355,000 people from food aid"], ''[[People's Daily]]'', [[September 12]], 2006</ref> UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the UNSC that "the tragedy in Darfur has reached a critical moment.

On [[September 14]], [[2006]], the leader of the now defunct [[Sudan Liberation Movement]], currently Senior Assistant to the [[President of Sudan|President of the Republic]] and Chairman of the Regional Interim Authority of Darfur, [[Minni Minnawi]], stated that he does not object to the new UN peacekeeping force, thereby breaking ranks with the Sudanese government who consider such a deployment to be an act of Western invasion. Minnawi claimed that the AU force "can do nothing because the AU mandate is very limited."<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14903230.htm "Ex-rebels says would accept UN in Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[September 14]], 2006</ref> Khartoum, however, remained sternly against the UN peacekeeping force, with Sudanese president Al-Bashir depicting it as a [[colonial]] plan, and stating that "we do not want Sudan to turn into [[Iraq War|another Iraq]]."<ref>[http://www.kuna.net.kw/home/story.aspx?Language=en&DSNO=907164 "We don't want Sudan to turn into "another Iraq" in the region - al-Bashir"], ''[[Kuwait News Agency]]'', [[September 21]], 2006</ref>

===Deterioration (October-November 2006)===
On [[October 2]], with the UN force plan indefinitely suspended on account of Sudanese opposition, the AU announced that it will extend its presence in the region until [[December 31]], [[2006]].<ref name="r1">[http://www.deepikaglobal.com/ENG4_sub.asp?ccode=ENG4&newscode=147406 "Genocide survivors urges EU sanctions over Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[October 20]], 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L0285506.htm "AU will not abandon Darfur - AU chairman"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[October 2]], 2006</ref> Two hundred UN troops were sent to reinforce the AU force.<ref>[http://torontosun.com/News/World/2006/10/10/1992164-sun.html "200 UN troops to deploy in Darfur"], ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', [[October 10]], 2006</ref> On [[October 6]], the UNSC voted to extend the mandate of the [[United Nations Mission in Sudan]] until [[April 30]], [[2007]]. <ref>[http://www.upi.com/InternationalIntelligence/view.php?StoryID=20061006-063151-8650r "Extend Sudan U.N. mission"], ''[[United Press International]]'', [[October 9]], 2006</ref> On [[October 9]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] listed Sudan's Darfur region as the most pressing food emergency out of the forty countries listed on its ''Crop Prospects and Food Situation'' report.<ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20176&Cr=&Cr1=Food "Forty countries face food shortages, Darfur crisis is the most pressing: UN agency"], ''[[United Nations]]'', [[October 9]], 2006</ref> On [[October 10]], the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Louise Arbour]], claimed that the Sudanese government had prior knowledge of attacks by Janjaweed militias in Buram, [[South Darfur]] the month before, an attack which saw hundreds of civilians killed.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1891572,00.html "UN official: Khartoum knew of Darfur militia raid"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[October 10]], 2006</ref> 

[[Image:Darfur report - Page 7 Image 1.jpg|thumb|Children in the camps are encouraged to confront their psychological scars. The clay figures depict an attack by Janjaweed.]]
On [[October 12]], the [[Foreign Minister of Nigeria]] [[Joy Ogwu]] arrived in Darfur for a two-day visit. She urged the Sudanese government to accept a UN formula. Speaking in [[Ethiopia]], [[President of Nigeria|Nigerian President]] [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] spoke against "stand[ing] by and see[ing] genocide being developed in Darfur."<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200610/12/eng20061012_311117.html "Nigerian FM arrives in Khartoum for talks on Darfur"], ''[[People's Daily]]'', [[October 12]], 2006</ref> On [[October 13]], [[President of the United States|US President]]  [[George W. Bush]] imposed further sanctions against those deemed complicit in the Darfur atrocities under the ''[[Darfur Peace and Accountability Act]] of 2006''. The measures were said to strengthen existing sanctions by prohibiting US citizens from engaging in oil-related transactions with Sudan (although US companies were prohibited from doing any business with Sudan since [[1997]]), freezing the assets of complicit parties and denying them entry to the US.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/13/AR2006101301464.html "Bush signs law setting sanctions on Darfur crimes"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[October 13]], 2006</ref>

Because the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]] is underfunded and badly equipped, it is said that until December 31, violence in Darfur will worsen, with government troops and allied militias, as well as rebels, blamed for new attacks. But so far there is no agreement on what will happen after that date. Aid workers say their access is severely limited by fighting, and some have warned the humanitarian situation could deteriorate to levels seen in [[2003]] and [[2004]] when U.N. officials called Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis.<ref name="r1"/>

On [[22 October]] [[2006]], the Sudanese government told U.N. envoy [[Jan Pronk]] to leave the country within three days. Pronk, the senior U.N. official in the country, had been heavily criticized by the army after he posted a description of several recent military defeats in Darfur to his personal [[blog]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6074808.stm "UN envoy is told to leave Sudan"], BBC News, [[22 October]] [[2006]]</ref> On [[November 1]], the US announced that it would formulate an international plan which they hoped the Sudanese government would find more palatable.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=N01464930 "U.S. works on international plan for Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', [[November 1]], [[2006]]</ref> On [[November 9]], senior Sudanese presidential advisor Nafie Ali Nafie told reporters that his government is prepared to start unconditional talks with the [[National Redemption Front]] (NRF)&mdash;the rebel alliance in Darfur&mdash;but noted he saw little use for a new peace agreement. The NRF, who had rejected the May Agreement (only an inter-SLM faction was signatory to it), did not issue a comment. It had previously sought a new peace agreement.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-11-09T105555Z_01_L09311339_RTRUKOC_0_US-SUDAN-DARFUR.xml&WTmodLoc=IntNewsHome_C2_worldNews-7 "Sudan says ready for talks with Darfur's NRF rebels"], ''[[Reuters]], [[November 9]], 2006</ref>
In late 2006, Darfur Arabs started their own rebel group, The Popular Forces Troops, and announced on December 6 that they had repulsed an assault by the Sudanese army at Kas-Zallingi the previous day. In a statement, they called the [[Janjaweed]] mercenaries who do not represent Darfur's Arabs. Since 2003, numerous Darfur Arab groups have announced their opposition to the government's war, some signing political accords with rebel movements.

Some of the splits within the Arab forces were tribe based. Sometime in late 2006, for example, relations between the farming [[Terjem]] and nomadic, camel-herding [[Mahria]] tribes became tense. Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, and Mahria leaders said the Terjem were stealing their animals even before that. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of [[South Darfur]], said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a seasonal migration, trampling through Terjem territory near the [[Bulbul River]]. Fighting would later resume in July 2007.<ref name=jg9307>gettleman, Jeffrey, "Chaos in Darfur on rise as Arabs fight with Arabs", news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[September 3]], [[2007]], pp 1, A7</ref>

Also on November 18, the AU reported that Sudanese military and Sudanese-backed militias had launched a ground and air operation in the region which resulted in about 70 civilian deaths. The AU stated that this "was a flagrant violation of security agreements."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6161692.stm "Sudan 'begins new Darfur attacks'"], ''[[BBC News]]'', [[November 18]], 2006</ref>

On [[November 25]], a spokesperson for [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Louise Arbour]] accused the Sudanese government of having committed "a deliberate and unprovoked attack" against civilians in the town of Sirba on [[November 11]], which claimed the lives of at least 30 people. The Commissioner's statement maintained that "contrary to the government<U+2019>s claim, it appears that the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on civilians and their property in Sirba," and that this also involved "extensive and wanton destruction and looting of civilian property."<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article18893 "Army attack against Darfur civilians was unprovoked - UN"], ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'', [[November 25]], 2006</ref>

The violence has spread over the border to Chad. On [[March 31]], [[2007]] Janjaweed militiamen killed up to 400 people in the volatile eastern border region of Chad near Sudan. The attack took place in the border villages of Tiero and Marena. The villages were encircled and then fired upon. Fleeing villagers were later subsequently chased. The women were robbed and the men shot according to the [[UNHCR]]. There were many who, despite surviving the initial attack, ended up dying due to exhaustion and dehydration, often while fleeing.<ref name=>{{cite news

</ref> The accord was brokered by Saudi Arabia. It sought to guarantee that each country would not be used to harbor, train or fund armed movements opposed to the government of the other. The Reuters News Service reported that "Deby's fears that [[Mahamat Nouri|Nouri]]'s UFDD may have been receiving Saudi as well as Sudanese support could have pushed him to sign the Saudi-mediated pact with Bashir on Thursday". Colin Thomas-Jensen, an expert on Chad and Darfur who works International Crisis Group think-tank has grave doubts as to whether "this new deal will lead to any genuine thaw in relations or improvement in the security situation". Additionally The Chadian rebel Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD) which has fought a hit-and-run war against Chad President Deby's forces in east Chad since 2006 stated that the Saudi-backed peace deal would not stop its military campaign. Thus the agreement may end up hurting the Sudanese rebels the most, leaving the Sudanese government with a freer hand.<ref name=>{{cite news

In its report it showed a photo of [[Nanchang Q-5|Chinese-made Fantan fighters]] that have been seen at [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]], Darfur and a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Antonov-26]] aircraft (painted white). The report provided evidence (including eyewitness testimony) that the Sudan Air Force has been conducting a pattern of indiscriminate aerial bombings of villages in Darfur and eastern Chad using ground attack jet fighters and Antonov planes. The report contained an image of a Russian made [[Mi-24]] attack helicopter (reg. n<U+00B0> 928) at Nyala airport in Darfur in March of 2007. For several years the Sudan Air Force has used this type of attack helicopter for operations during Janjaweed attacks on villages in Al Darfur. The report also showed evidence that the government has been camouflaging military aircraft and helicopters by painting them white and in doing so, tried to cover up their military use by claiming that they were civilian in nature. The photo of the white Antonov-26 aircraft was reported to have been used in Darfur in bombing missions.  Recently it has been confirmed by Airforces Monthly Magazine for June 2007, that China and Iran have financed and delivered "newer" aircraft for Sudan. The most recent additions have been 15-20 A-5 Fantan ground attack aircraft. Also confirmed by Airforces Monthly, is the use of Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships and Mil Mi-171 Assault Helicopters. They have been photographed painted in U.N. markings and white color for disguised use in illegal attack missions into the Darfur Region. The base in which they have been seen is at Nyala Airport in the Dafur Region. 8 Hinds have been confirmed operating in the Dafur region. One An-26 transport has been also confirmed delivered from a Russian civil aviation corporation. This aircraft is modified with bomb racks, and painted in U.N. white for illegal bombing missions into Darfur. The aircraft serial 7705 is used, but actually confirmed as 26563. Training for Sudanese crew has recently been confirmed to have been conducted and ongoing at Dezful-Ardestani Air Base in southern Iran. China and Russia denied they had broken UN sanctions. China has a close relationship with Sudan and increased its military co-operation with the government in early 2007. Because of Sudan's plentiful supply of oil China considers good relations with Sudan to be a strategic necessity that is needed to fuel its booming economy. It must be noted that India also have oil interests in the country. <ref name=>{{cite news

===June 2007===
[[Oxfam]] announced on June 17 that it is permanently pulling out of Gereida, the largest camp in Darfur, where more than 130,000 have sought refuge. The agency cited inaction by local authorities from the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM), which controls the region, in addressing security concerns and violence against aid workers. An employee of the NGO [[Action by Churches Together]] was murdered in June in West Darfur.

On [[July 31]], the ongoing conflict between the Terjem and the Mahria tribes (former partners in the Janjaweed) heated up, with Mahria gunmen surrounding mourners at the funeral of an important Terjem sheik and killing 60 with [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) and belt-fed [[machine guns]].<ref name=jg9307/>

===August 2007===

From [[3 August]] [[2007]] until [[5 August]] [[2007]], a conference was held in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]], to unite the different existing rebel groups to make the subsequent peace negotiations with the [[government of Sudan]] more streamlined.

In the several months up through August, Arab tribes that had worked together in the Janjaweed militia began falling out among themselves, and even further splintered into factions. Terjem fought Mahria as thousands of gunmen from each side traveled hundreds of miles to fight in the strategic Bulbul river valley. Farther south, Habanniya and Salamat tribes clashed. The fighting did not result in as much killing as in 2003 and 2004, the height of the violence. United Nations officials said the groups might be trying to seize land before U.N. and African Union peacekeepers arrived.<ref name=jg9307/>

===September 2007===

On [[September 30]] [[2007]], the rebels [[Haskanita raids|overran an AMIS]] base, killing at least 12 peacekeepers in "the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission" during a raid at the end of [[Ramadan]] season.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071001/ap_on_re_af/sudan_darfur</ref>
===October 2007===
Peace talks started on 27 October 2007 in [[Sirte]], [[Libya]]. The following groups attended the talks:<ref>http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24453</ref>

* Justice and Equality Movement splinters:
** Justice and Equality Movement<U+2013>Collective Leadership, led by Bahar Idriss Abu Garda
** Justice and Equality Movement<U+2013>Azraq, led by Idriss Ibrahim Azraq
** [[National Movement for Reform and Development]], led by Khalil Abdullah
* Revolutionary Democratic Forces Front, led by Salah Abu Surrah
* United Revolutionary Force Front, led by Alhadi Agabeldour
* Sudan Liberation Movement<U+2013>G19, led by [[Khamees Abdullah]]
* Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance, led by Ahmed Ibrahim Diraige

The following groups didn't attend:

* [[Justice and Equality Movement]], led by Khalil Ibrahim; they object to the presence of rebel groups they say had no constituency and no place at the table.
* Sudan Liberation Movement (Abdel Wahed), led by Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur; the group has few forces, but its leader is highly respected; refused to attend until a force was deployed to stem the Darfur violence.
* Sudan Liberation Movement<U+2013>Unity, originally led by Abdallah Yehya, includes many other prominent figures (Sherif Harir, Abu Bakr Kadu, Ahmed Kubur); the group with the largest number of rebel fighters; object for the same reason as JEM.
* Ahmed Abdel Shafi, a notable rebel enjoying strong support from the [[Fur tribe]].

Faced with a boycott from the most important rebel factions, the talks were rebranded as an "advanced consultation phase", with actual talks likely to start in November or December.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm</ref>

===November 2007===
On [[2007-11-15]], nine rebel groups <U+2014> six SLM factions, the Democratic Popular Front, the Sudanese Revolutionary Front and the Justice and Equality Movement<U+2013>Field Revolutionary Command <U+2014> signed a Charter of Unification and agreed to operate under the name of SLM/A henceforth.<ref>http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24751</ref> On [[2007-11-30]] it was announced that Darfur's rebel movements had united into two large groups and were now ready to negotiate in an orderly structure with the government.<ref>http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24965</ref>

== International response==
[[Image:Save Darfur sign from New York .jpg|thumb|The [[Save Darfur Coalition]] advocacy group coordinated a large rally in [[Washington, D.C.]] in April 2006]]
{{main|International response to the Darfur conflict}}
International attention to the Darfur conflict largely began with reports by the advocacy organizations [[Amnesty International]] in July 2003 and the [[International Crisis Group]] in December 2003.  However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, [[Mukesh Kapila]], called Darfur the "world's greatest humanitarian crisis" in March 2004.<ref>Prunier, pp. 124-148</ref>  A movement advocating for [[humanitarian intervention]] has emerged in several countries since then.

[[G<U+00E9>rard Prunier]], a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argues that the world's most powerful countries have largely limited their response to expressions of concern and demands that the United Nations take action. The UN, lacking both the funding and military support of the wealthy countries, has left the [[African Union]] to deploy a token force ([[African Union Mission in Sudan|AMIS]]) without a mandate to protect civilians. In the lack of foreign political will to address the political and economic structures that underlie the conflict, the [[international community]] has defined the Darfur conflict in humanitarian assistance terms and debated the "genocide" label.<ref>Prunier, pp. 124-148</ref>

===Genocide claims===
{{main|International response to the Darfur conflict#Declarations of genocide}}

On [[September 18]], [[2004]], the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|UN Security Council passed Resolution 1564]], which called for a [[Commission of Inquiry on Darfur]] to assess the Sudanese conflict. The UN report released on [[January 31]], [[2005]] stated that while there were mass murders and rapes, they could not label it as genocide because "genocidal intent appears to be missing".<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General], 18 September 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/world/national/2005/02/01/newdarfur-report050201.html Sudan's mass killings not genocide: UN report], [[CBC News]], [[1 February]] [[2005]]</ref>

To address the dire human rights and humanitarian emergency in Darfur, the United Nations has taken several steps, but all of these have been frustrated by the Government of the Sudan with the support of a number of other Governments including Egypt and Algeria.

In January 2005, the UN Secretary-General's Commission of Inquiry on Darfur issued a well documented report that indicated that there was by then already some 1.6 million internally displaced persons as a result of the ongoing violence, more than 200,000 refugees from Darfur into neighbouring Chad, and that Government forces and allied militia had committed widespread and consistent war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, torture, mass rape, summary executions and arbitrary detention. The Commission found that technically there was not a genocide in the legal sense of the term but that massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law were continuing. The Commission also found that the Janjaweed militia operated alongside or with ground or air logistical support from the Government's armed forces. In March 2005, the UN Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, and the Court has since issued arrest warrants for two high ranking individuals in the Government's aparatus.

In early 2007, a High Level Mission on the situation of human rights in Darfur was set up to look into reports of ongoing violations and to try to work with the Government of the Sudan to put a stop to the atrocities. The Mission was led by Nobel Prize Winner Jody Williams and included a number of diplomats and human rights practitioners. The Mission travelled to Ethiopia and Chad but it was never admitted into Sudanese territory itself because the Government refused to issue visas to the Mission. As a result, the High Level Mission could only collect information and in its report of March 2007, it underlined the Government's responsibility to protect civilians in Darfur, noting with regret the Government's abject failure to fulfill this responsibility.

Around the same time, the United Nations Human Rights Council appointed seven UN human rights special rapporteurs to form a group of experts on Darfur. This group was composed of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for children and armed conflict, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Coordinator of the group of experts was [[Lyal Sunga]].  In June 2007, the group of experts issued a report that compiled pre-existing recommendations that had been already issued by UN human rights bodies in order to get the Government to implement them. On 11 December 2007, the group of experts issued its final 106-page report to the Human Rights Council which details the status of the Government's implementation of the recommendations the group had brought together and which concluded that the Government's implementation of human rights recommendations has been largely inadequate. <ref> [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/6session/A.HRC.6.19AEV_en.pdf]</ref><ref> [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/04/AR2007120400790.html]</ref><ref> [http://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B9C2E/(httpNewsByYear_en)/503FF0E7C90944E8C12573AE004E6BF7?OpenDocument]</ref>

In [[2005]], Rep. [[Henry Hyde]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Illinois|IL]]) and Sen. [[Sam Brownback]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Kansas|KS]]) introduced the [[Darfur Peace and Accountability Act]], which calls on the United States to take a more active role in stopping the alleged genocide, encourages [[NATO]] participation, and endorses a [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII mandate]] for a UN mission in Darfur. The bill was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] and as of August 2006 is in [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]]. In [[August]] [[2006]], the [[Genocide Intervention Network]] released a Darfur scorecard, rating each member of Congress on legislation relating to the conflict.<ref>[http://darfurscores.org/ "Darfur scorecard"]</ref>

===Criticism of international response===
On [[October 16]], 2006, [[Minority Rights Group International|Minority Rights Group]] (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the [[great power]]s could have prevented the deepening crisis in Darfur and that few lessons appear to have been drawn from their ineptitude during the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. MRG's executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: "this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ... Darfur would just not be in this situation had the UN systems got its act together after Rwanda: their action was too little too late."<ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=136&art_id=iol1160956523318B235 "UN could have averted Darfur crisis - MRG"], ''Independent Online'', [[October 16]], 2006</ref> On [[October 20]], 120 genocide survivors of the [[Holocaust]], the [[Cambodia under Pol Pot (1975-1979)|Cambodian]] and Rwandan Genocides, backed by six aid agencies, submitted an open letter to the [[European Union]], calling on them to do more to end the atrocities in Darfur, with a [[Darfur conflict#New proposed UN peacekeeping force|UN peacekeeping force]] as "the only viable option." [[Aegis Trust]] director, James Smith, stated that while "the African Union has worked very well in Darfur and done what it could, the rest of the world hasn't supported those efforts the way it should have done with sufficient funds and sufficient equipment."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6069600.stm "Darfur call by genocide survivors"], ''[[BBC]]'', [[October 20]], 2006</ref>

On the opposite side of the issue, publicity given to the Darfur conflict has been criticized in some segments of the Arab media as exaggerated. Statements to this effect take the view that "the (Israeli) lobby prevents any in-depth discussion and diverts the attention from the crimes committed every day in Palestine and Iraq."<ref>[http://64.26.31.21:2010/opinion/OPED/04-2007/Article-20070413-ea5b7f2f-c0a8-10ed-00a3-4c8cb7c2deac/story.html "Since The Victims Are Arabs and Muslims"] by Jihad Al-Khazen, ''[[Al-Hayat]]'' (English edition), April 13, 2007.</ref> and that Western attention to the Darfur crisis is "a cover for what is really being planned and carried out by the Western forces of hegemony and control in our Arab world."<ref>editorial in the newspaper ''Al-Gomhouriya'' (Egypt), April 20, 2007</ref> While "in New York, ... there are thousands of posters screaming 'genocide' and '400,000 people dead," in reality only "200,000 have been killed." Furthermore, "what has been done" in Darfur is "not genocide," simply "war crimes."<ref>editorial in the newspaper ''Al-Gomhouriya'' (Egypt), April 20, 2007</ref>   Another complaint made is that "there is no ethnic cleansing being perpetrated" in Darfur, only "great instability" and "clashes between the Sudanese government, rebel movements and the Janjaweed."<ref>Sudanese journalist Babker 'Issa, editor of the daily newspaper ''Al-Raya,'' ''Al-Raya'' (Qatar), April 20, 2007.</ref>

==Counting deaths==
[[Image:Darfur report - Page 6 Image 1.jpg|thumb|A mother with her sick baby at Abu Shouk IDP camp in [[North Darfur]].]]
Accurate numbers of dead have been difficult to estimate, partly because the Sudanese government places formidable obstacles in front of journalists attempting to cover the conflict.<ref name="Sudan Annual Report 2004">[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=9946 Sudan Annual Report 2004] Reporters Without Borders, 2004</ref>
In September 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to [[starvation]]. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include violent deaths.<ref name="How many have died">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4268733.stm How many have died in Darfur?] By Russell Smith (BBC) 16 February, 2005</ref>  A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,<ref name="death toll may be 300,000">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers] (Reuters), 30 March, 2005</ref> and others have estimated even more.

In March 2005, the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator|Emergency Relief Coordinator]] 
[[Jan Egeland]] estimated that 10,000 were dying each month excluding deaths due to ethnic violence.<ref name="death estimate soars">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4349063.stm UN's Darfur death estimate soars] (BBC) 14 March, 2005</ref> An estimated 2 million people had at that time been displaced from their homes, mostly seeking refuge in camps in Darfur's major towns. Two hundred thousand had fled to neighboring [[Chad]].

In an April 2005 report, the most comprehensive statistical analysis to date, the [[Coalition for International Justice]] estimated that 400,000 people in Darfur had died since the conflict began, a figure most humanitarian and human rights groups now use.<ref name="New analysis claims Darfur deaths near 400,000">[http://www.cij.org/publications/New_Analysis_Claims_Darfur_Deaths_Near_400_000.pdf New analysis claims Darfur deaths near 400,000] [[Coalition for International Justice]], 21 April 2005 (PDF)</ref>

On [[28 April]], [[2006]], Dr. [[Eric Reeves]] argued that "extant data, in aggregate, strongly suggest that total excess mortality in Darfur, over the course of more than three years of deadly conflict, now significantly exceeds 450,000," but this has not been independently verified.<ref name="Quantifying Genocide in Darfur">[http://www.sudanreeves.org/Article102.html Quantifying Genocide in Darfur] Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], 28 April 2006</ref>

A [[21 September]], [[2006]] article by the official [[UN News Service]] stated that "UN officials estimate over 400,000 people have lost their lives and some 2 million more have been driven from their homes."<ref>"[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=19948&Cr=sudan&Cr1= Annan welcomes extension f African Union mission in Darfur]," UN News Service, [[21 September]] [[2006]]</ref> This now appears to be the official UN figure.

==Spreading of violence==
{{main|War in Chad|Central African Republic Bush War}}
Violence in Darfur spread over the border to Chad and the [[Central African Republic]]. In [[Chad]], notably, the Janjaweed were accused of incursions and attacks.  They were also accused of killing over 500,000.
