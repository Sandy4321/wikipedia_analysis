''Coffins on Io'' marks a notable change in sound. It combines influences of [[Type O Negative]], [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[dark wave]] and other 80s electronic musicians.<ref>[http://www.kayodot.net/ Official Kayo Dot website]</ref> It combines aspects of [[electronic music]], [[jazz fusion]], [[post-punk]], [[gothic rock]] and [[new wave music|new wave]]. Unlike [[Hubardo]], there are no death growls on the album.<ref>[http://www.kayodot.net/ Official Kayo Dot website]</ref> It was produced by Toby Driver. The album was officially released on the 15th via Revolver USA.

==Writing and recording==
After releasing an album on [[The Flenser]] for one of Driver's other bands, ''Vaura'', Driver gave the label  four songs that he had considered releasing under a different band moniker. After the label's reception to the tracks, he decided to release it under the Kayo Dot moniker, the label signing the band to a contract then, the band's first music to be released by a label since 2010. The album began as a four-song experiment, and was transformed into a full-length album.<ref>[http://beardedgentlemenmusic.com/2014/10/29/interview-toby-driver-kayo-dot/ Bearded Gentlemen Interview with Toby Driver]</ref> Continuing the theme of the last album, the album was recorded by the full live band.

==Music and lyrics==
Driver has said that the album was influenced by [[dark wave]] as well as [[Type O Negative]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and other similar electronic bands of the 1980s.  Driver said in an interview that the album was heavily influenced by [[dark wave]] and was written as evoking "1980s retrofuture noir."<ref>[http://beardedgentlemenmusic.com/2014/10/29/interview-toby-driver-kayo-dot/ Bearded Gentlemen Interview with Toby Driver]</ref>

Driver's insistence that the album stay away from the influence of [[Hubardo]] resulted in an album that sounds drastically different from prior Kayo Dot albums. There are no growled vocals, and the album is not metal like many of the prior albums. In addition, this album relies heavily on repetition and melody, something prior Kayo Dot albums have strayed away from. Driver said in an interview that film heavily influenced the direction of the album, specifically [[Blade Runner]].<ref>[http://emptylighthouse.com/interview-toby-driver-kayo-dot-1597456051 Empty Lighthouse Interview with Toby Driver]</ref>

The album was released on October 15 through [[The Flenser]]. It is available for purchase on The Flenser's site and Kayo Dot's bandcamp in [[MP3]], [[FLAC]], [[CD]] and [[LP album|LP]].
