'''Bernard Cyril Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg''', [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]], [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] ([[March 21]], [[1889]] <U+2014> [[July 4]], [[1963]]) is probably [[New Zealand]]'s most famous soldier and commander. 

He served as an officer in the [[British Army]] in [[World War I]], during which he was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. 

During the [[Second World War]], he was the [[New Zealand Army]] Expeditionary Force commander in [[Battle of Crete]], the [[North African Campaign]] and the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]].

==Early life==
Freyberg, born in [[Richmond upon Thames]] in [[England]], moved to New Zealand with his parents at the age of two. He attended [[Wellington College (New Zealand)|Wellington College]] from [[1897]] to [[1904]].

A strong swimmer, he won the New Zealand 100-yards championship in [[1906]] and in [[1910]].

On [[May 22]] [[1911]], he gained formal registration as a dentist. He worked as an assistant dentist in [[Morrinsville]] and later practised in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and in [[Levin]]. While in Morrinsville he was asked to take up a [[Subaltern (rank)|subaltern]]ship in the local Territorial Army unit, but he did not succeed in gaining the King's commission.

Freyberg left New Zealand in March [[1914]]. Records exist of him in [[San Francisco]] and in [[Mexico]], where he may have taken part in the [[Mexican Revolution|civil war]] then raging in that country. Upon hearing of the outbreak of [[World War I|war]] in [[Europe]] in August 1914, he travelled to England.

==World War I==
In late 1914, Freyberg met and persuaded the then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]], to grant him a commission in the [[Hood Battalion (Royal Navy)|Hood Battalion]] of the newly-constituted [[Royal Naval Division]].

In [[1915]] Freyberg became involved in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Dardanelles campaign]]. During the initial landings by Allied troops following the unsuccessful attempt to force the straits by sea, Freyberg swam ashore in the [[Gulf of Saros]]. Once ashore, he began lighting flares so as to distract the defending Turkish forces from the real landings taking place at [[Gallipoli]]. Despite coming under heavy Turkish fire, he returned safely from this outing, and for his action he received his first [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]. He received serious wounds on several occasions and left the [[peninsula]] when his division evacuated in January [[1916]].

Freyberg went to France in May 1916. He received the [[Victoria Cross]] at the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. On [[November 13]], 1916 at [[Beaucourt-sur-Ancre]], [[France]], after carrying the initial attack through the enemy's front system of trenches, Freyberg's battalion was much disorganised, but after rallying and re-forming his own men and some others, he led them on a successful assault of the second objective, during which he suffered two wounds, but remained in command and held his ground throughout the day and the following night. When reinforced the next morning he attacked and captured a strongly fortified village, taking 500 prisoners. He was wounded twice more, the second time severely, but he refused to leave the line until he had issued final instructions. His citation described the end result of these actions, stating that "[Freyberg] enabled the lodgement of the corps to be permanently held, and on this point the line was eventually formed" for subsequent offensives.

During his time on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] Freyberg continued to lead by example. His leadership had a cost however: Freyberg received nine wounds during his service in France, and men who served with him later in his career said hardly a part of his body did not have scars.

Freyberg gained promotion to the rank of Temporary Brigadier and took command of a brigade in the [[58th (2/1st London) Division|58th Division]] in April [[1917]], reportedly making him the youngest [[general]] in the [[British Army]]. By the end of the war Freyberg had added a further two DSOs and the French [[Croix de guerre|Croix Militaire de Guerre]] to his name, as well as being [[Mentioned in Dispatches|mentioned in despatches]] five more times after his escapade at Saros.

==Family==
After the war, Freyberg married [[Barbara Freyberg, Baroness Freyberg|Barbara McLaren]] (a daughter of [[Herbert Jekyll|Sir Herbert Jekyll]] and the widow of [[Francis McLaren|Hon. Francis McLaren]]) at [[St. Martha's Hill|St Martha on the Hill]] on [[14 June]] [[1922]]. Barbara had two children from her previous marriage and she and Freyberg later had a son, [[Paul Freyberg, 2nd Baron Freyberg|Paul]].

==World War II==

Freyberg became classified as unfit for active service with the British Army in [[1937]]. However, following the outbreak of war in September [[1939]] he returned to the British Army active list. Following an approach from the New Zealand government, Freyberg offered his services and subsequently gained appointment as commander of the [[2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] and of the [[New Zealand 2nd Division]]. 

In the chaos of the retreat from the [[Balkans Campaign|Greek mainland campaign]] of [[1941]], London gave Freyberg command of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces during the [[Battle of Crete]]. Controversy surrounds his use of [[ULTRA]] intelligence messages during this battle.

Freyberg continued to command the New Zealand 2nd Division through the [[North African Campaign|North African]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]s of the [[British Eighth Army]]. He had become a popular commander with the New Zealand soldiers by the time he left his command (with the rank of lieutenant general) in [[1945]].

==Post war==
Following his retirement from the Army, Freyberg served as [[Governor-General of New Zealand]] from [[1946]] until [[1952]]. In this post he played a very active role, visiting all parts of New Zealand and its dependencies.

The Crown raised Freyberg to the peerage as '''Baron Freyberg''' of Wellington in New Zealand and of Munstead in the County of Surrey in [[1951]].

After his term as New Zealand Governor-General had finished Freyberg returned to England where he sat frequently in the [[House of Lords]]. On [[March 1]], [[1953]] he became the Deputy Constable and Lieutenant-Governor of [[Windsor Castle]]; he took up residence in the Norman Gateway the following year. 

Freyberg died at Windsor on [[July 4]], [[1963]] following the rupture of one of his war wounds, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St. Martha's Hill|St Martha on the Hill]] in [[Guildford]], Surrey.
