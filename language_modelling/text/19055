The '''New Zealand Liberal Party of 1962''', an historic laissez-faire Liberal Party, was formed to stand in the [[New Zealand general election, 1963|1963 New Zealand general election]]. 

<U+201C>At one time (the new <U+2018>Liberal<U+2019> Party) seemed to have two wings, one in Auckland and one in Christchurch, but before polling day (30 November) these were united under Mr. R.M. Hutton-Potts, a former editor of the ''Southland Daily News''. Liberal Party policy was somewhat similar to that of the Constitutional Society, and included attacks on over-staffed government departments and proposals for a written constitution and for the restoration of an upper house.<U+201D> 

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1963|election]] <U+201C>The Liberals, with over twenty candidates, collected only 1 per cent of the vote, although they caused the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] a little concern by drawing financial support from some farmers in Canterbury.<U+201D> <ref> Milne, R. S. ''Political Parties in New Zealand'' pages 66-67 (1966, Clarendon Press, Oxford)  </ref>
