==Personal life==
Kim Yu-Na was born in 1990 in [[Bucheon]], South Korea and moved to [[Gunpo]] when she was 6 years old. In 2006, she moved to [[Toronto, Canada]] for training. Kim is currently a freshman at [[Korea University]]<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/10/136_33341.html | title = Kim Yu-na Captures Skate America Title | accessdate = 2009-03-09 | date = 2008-01-27 | publisher = [[Korea Times]] }}</ref>, but she continues training at [[Toronto, Canada]].

==Career==
===Early career===
Kim Yu-Na began skating at the age of 6 at her mother's encouragement. In 2002, she competed internationally for the first time at the [[Triglav Trophy]] where she won the novice competition. In 2003, at age 12, she became the youngest lady to win the senior title at the [[South Korean Figure Skating Championships]]. She won her second international competition, the novice competition at the [[Golden Bear of Zagreb]] in 2003.

===Junior career===

====2004-2005 season====
In the 2004<U+2013>2005 season, Kim was internationally Junior age eligible. She competed on the ISU Junior Grand Prix, the Junior complement to the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. She won the silver medal in China and the gold medal in Hungary. She won the silver medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final with an overal score 35.08 points behind the gold medalist, future rival [[Mao Asada]]. Kim won the senior national title on her way to the [[2005 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]]. At that competition, Kim won the silver medal, again behind Asada. 

====2005-2006 season====
For the 2005<U+2013>2006 season, the choice was made for Kim Yu-Na to remain on the Junior Grand Prix. She was not old enough to compete at the 2006 Olympics even if South Korea qualified for a spot at the final qualifying competition, the [[2005 Karl Sch<U+00E4>fer Memorial]], and so Kim remained on the Junior Grand Prix. Kim won both her Junior Grand Prix events to qualify for the Junior Grand Prix Final.
She won the Junior Grand Prix Final with a score that was 28.34 points ahead of silver medalist [[Aki Sawada]]. At that free skating, Kim landed seven triple jumps, including a [[Flip jump|triple flip]] - [[Toe loop jump|triple toe loop]] combination and [[Axel jump|double Axel]] - [[Toe loop jump|triple toe loop]] combination.
Kim won her fourth senior national title. At the [[2006 World Junior Figure Skating Championships]], she competed against the defending champion Mao Asada. Kim won the gold medal with a 24.19 margin of victory.

===Senior career===

====2006-2007 season====
In the 2006-2007 season, Kim made her senior international debut at [[2006 Skate Canada]] where she won a bronze medal after winning the short program and placing fourth in the free skate.She won the [[2006 Troph<U+00E9>e Eric Bompard]] with a score 10.1 points above silver medalist [[Miki Ando]]. Her win and bronze medal qualified Kim for the first time for the Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final. At the  [[2006 Grand Prix Final]], held in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, Kim placed third in the short program and won the long program, to win the title overall, with a margin of victory of 11.68 ahead of silver medalist Mao Asada.
Kim originally intended to defend her title at the 2006<U+2013>2007 South Korean Championships, but was forced to withdraw with injury before the event. In January 2007, Kim was diagnosed with early-stage [[disc herniation|lumbar disc herniation (L<sub>4</sub>~L<sub>5</sub>)]]<ref>{{cite web

| url = http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2007010487838
| accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}</ref>. Kim was selected to compete at the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships]] based on her performance from the season so far. Because of the placement of [[Choi Ji Eun]] the year before, South Korea had only one spot to the World Championships.
In March 2007, at the 2007 World Championships in Tokyo, Kim won the short program, setting the short program world record for the highest score under the [[ISU Judging System]]. She placed fourth in the long program and placed third overall. She was 8.31 points behind silver medalist Mao Asada and 5.91 points ahead of fourth place finisher [[Kimmie Meissner]]. Kim's placement qualified South Korea two ladies entries for the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://isu.sportcentric.net/db//files/serve.php?id=597 | title = International Skating Union Communication No. 1469 Entries ISU Championships 2008 | format = PDF | publisher = [[International Skating Union]] | accessdate = 2009-03-09 }}</ref>.

====2007-2008 season====
Kim started off the 2007<U+2013>2008 season winning the [[2007 Cup of China]] with a score that was 24.34 points ahead of silver medalist [[Caroline Zhang]]. At the [[2007 Cup of Russia]], Kim won both the short program and the long program to finish 24.43 points ahead of silver medalist [[Yukari Nakano]].

She won the short program and placed second in the long program to win her second Grand Prix Final competition by 5.24 points ahead of Asada. Kim chose not to compete at the 2007<U+2013>2008 South Korean nationals and withdrew from the [[2008 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships]] a week before the event due to a hip injury. 
Kim recovered in time to compete at the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships]]. She placed fifth in the short program after she fell on [[Lutz jump|triple lutz]] jump. But she rebounded in the free skate to win that portion of the event with 123.38, winning her second consecutive bronze medal at the World Championships.

====2008-2009 season====
Kim was assigned to the [[2008 Skate America]] and the [[2008 Cup of China]] Grand Prix competitions for the 2008-2009 seasons.  At Skate America, Kim placed first in the short program with a score of 69.50, separating herself from the rest of the field by a margin of 11.70 points despite having trouble on her double axel<ref>{{cite web
