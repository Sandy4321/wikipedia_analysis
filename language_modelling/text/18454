'''Quantico National Cemetery''' is a [[military cemetery]] in [[Triangle, Virginia]] for veterans that served in the [[United States Armed Forces]].  Adjacent to and originally part of [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], it was established as a [[national cemetery]] in 1983 with an [[area]] of {{convert|725|acre}}.

==Location==
Quantico National Cemetery is located on land that was part of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] training base adjacent to [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]] in [[Prince William County]], [[Virginia]]. The land has been used by the military for over 200 years. First, around 1775 by the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] for Navy operations, and later, as a blockade point for the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. 

In 1918 a permanent Marine base was established at Quantico. The Marine Corps Schools, a forerunner of the Marine Corps Development and Education Command, was created there in 1921. Since 1941, the focus of the base has been individual education rather than unit training. In 1977, the Marine Corps donated 725 acres (2.9 km<U+00B2>) of this land to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration, to establish a facility at Quantico. The cemetery was formally dedicated on May 15, 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/cems/nchp/quantico.asp |title=Cemeteries - Quantico National Cemetery |date=8 December 2011 |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref>

==Monuments and memorials==
There are seven memorials in all. A monument to [[Marine Raiders|Edson<U+2019>s Raiders]] was the first memorial dedicated at Quantico National Cemetery, unveiled on the memorial pathway on August 6, 1989. It is dedicated to the 800 members of the First Marine Raider Battalion, which from August 1942 to October 1943, played a key role in helping the greatly outnumbered American forces push back Japanese troops in the British Solomon Islands.

The [[Purple Heart]] Memorial was dedicated August 7, 1990, in honor of Purple Heart medal recipients interred at the cemetery. The Purple Heart was created by [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Washington]] in 1782 and was originally awarded for heroism. It eventually fell into disuse until 1931 when Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur]] revived it for soldiers who were wounded or killed in defense of their nation.

Additional memorials honor: the Fourth Marine or <U+201C>Fighting Fourth<U+201D> Division; the Commonwealth of Virginia Memorial dedicated to honor all of the nation<U+2019>s veterans; the First Marine Division Memorial; and the 6th Marine Division or <U+201C>Striking Sixth<U+201D> Memorial to honor the division that won the [[Presidential Unit Citation]] for its actions in the [[Battle of Okinawa]] during [[World War II]]; the memorial design is based on an [[Ryukyuan religion#At the tomb|Okinawan tomb]].<ref>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMB12X Striking Sixth - 6th Marine Division - World War II Memorials]</ref>
