The '''Profumo affair''' was a British political scandal that originated with a brief sexual liaison in 1961 between [[John Profumo]], the [[Secretary of State for War]] in [[Harold Macmillan]]'s government, and [[Christine Keeler]], a 19-year-old would-be model. In March 1963 Profumo denied any impropriety in a personal statement{{#tag:ref|In the UK parliament, the "personal statement" is a device whereby a member can make a point of a personal nature, to correct an earlier mistake, to confirm or deny a rumour, or to apologise for giving offence. According to the political journalist [[Wayland Young]], because members are by tradition never questioned on such statements, they are "occasions for a special degree of truthfulness".<ref name= Y17>Young, p. 17</ref>|group= n}} to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], but was forced to admit the truth a few weeks later. He resigned from the government and from Parliament. The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan's self-confidence, and he resigned as prime minister on health grounds in October 1963. His [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative]] party was marked by the scandal, which may have contributed to its defeat by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]].

When the Profumo<U+2013>Keeler affair was first revealed, public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved  with [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Captain Yevgeny Ivanov]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Military attach<U+00E9>|naval attach<U+00E9>]], thereby creating a possible security risk. Keeler knew both Profumo and Ivanov through her friendship with [[Stephen Ward]], an [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopath]] and socialite who had taken her under his wing.  The exposure of the affair generated rumours of other scandals, and drew official attention to the activities of Ward, who was charged with a series of immorality offences.  Perceiving himself as a [[scapegoat]] for the misdeeds of others, Ward took a fatal overdose during the final stages of his trial, which found him guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and her friend [[Mandy Rice-Davies]].

An inquiry into the affair by a senior judge, [[Lord Denning]], indicated that there had been no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection. Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at [[Toynbee Hall]], an East London charitable trust. By 1975 he had been officially rehabilitated, although he did not return to public life. He died, honoured and respected, in 2006.  Keeler found it difficult to escape the negative image attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of [[The Establishment|Establishment]] revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]], with the possibility of a later reference to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]]. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.

==Background==
===Government and press===
In the early 1960s British news media were dominated by several high-profile spying stories: the breaking of the [[Portland Spy Ring|Portland spy ring]] in 1961, the capture and sentencing of [[George Blake]] in the same year and, in 1962, the case of the [[Admiralty]] clerk, [[John Vassall]], blackmailed into spying by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] who threatened to expose his homosexuality.<ref>Pincher, p. 65</ref> In October 1962 Vassall was jailed for 18 years.  After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters, the responsible minister, [[Tam Galbraith|Thomas Galbraith]], resigned from the government pending inquiries. Galbraith was later exonerated by the [[Cyril Radcliffe, 1st Viscount Radcliffe|Radcliffe inquiry]], which sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall's private life.<ref>Levin, pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref> The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] government;<ref>Levin, p. 62</ref> the ''[[New Statesman]]''{{'}}s columnist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] threatened: "[A]ny Tory minister or MP&nbsp;... who gets involved in a scandal during the next year or so must expect<U+2014>I regret to say<U+2014>the full treatment".<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 241, quoting Paul Johnson in the ''New Statesman'', 22 March 1963</ref>{{#tag:ref|The two imprisoned reporters, Brendan Mulholland and Reg Foster, were initially hailed as martyrs and heroes, defending the high moral principle of press freedom. Davenport-Hines states "they did not want to admit they were liars who had invented their stories".<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 240</ref> |group= n}}

===Profumo===
[[John Profumo]] was born in 1915, of Italian descent. He first entered [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament]] in 1940 as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member for [[Kettering (UK Parliament constituency)|Kettering]], while serving with the [[Northamptonshire Yeomanry]], and combined his political and military duties through the Second World War. He lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], but was elected in 1950 for [[Stratford-on-Avon (UK Parliament constituency)|Stratford-on-Avon]]. From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations. In 1960 Macmillan promoted him to [[Secretary of State for War]], a senior post outside the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].<ref name= odnbP>{{cite web|last= Heffer|first= Simon|title= Profumo, John Dennis  [Jack]|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/97107?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate= 11 January 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref>  After his marriage in 1954 to [[Valerie Hobson]], one of Britain's leading film actresses, he may have conducted casual affairs, using late-night parliamentary sittings as his cover.<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 59</ref> Profumo's tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces, involving the end of conscription and the development of a wholly professional army. His performance was watched with a critical eye by his opposition counterpart [[George Wigg]], a former [[Regular army|regular soldier]].<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 66</ref><ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 93<U+2013>94</ref>

===Keeler, Rice-Davis, and Astor===

[[Christine Keeler]], born in 1942, left school at 15 with no qualifications and took a series of short-lived jobs in shops, offices and caf<U+00E9>s. She aspired to be a model, and at 16 had a photograph published in ''[[Tit-Bits]]'' magazine.<ref>Irving et al, pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref> In August 1959 she found work as a topless showgirl at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, [[Soho]]. This long-established club attracted a distinguished clientele who, Keeler wrote, "could look but could not touch".<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 56</ref><ref>Keeler, p. 2</ref> Shortly after starting at Murray's, Keeler was introduced to a client, the society [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopath]] [[Stephen Ward]].

===Ward and Ivanov===
Stephen Ward, born in [[Hertfordshire]] in 1912, qualified as an osteopath in the United States. After the Second World War he began practising in [[Cavendish Square]], London,<ref name= odnbW>{{cite web|last= Davenport-Hines|first= Richard|title= Ward, Stephen Thomas  |url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40839|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|accessdate= 11 January 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> where he rapidly established a reputation and attracted many distinguished patients. These connections, together with his personal charm, brought him considerable social success. In his spare time Ward attended art classes at the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade school]],<ref name= odnbW/> and developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 he was commissioned by ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the Royal family, among them [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]].<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 61<U+2013>66</ref> 

Ward hoped to visit the  Soviet Union  to draw portraits of Russian leaders; to help him, one of his patients, the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' editor [[Colin Coote|Sir Colin Coote]], arranged an introduction to [[Yevgeny Ivanov (spy)|Yevgeny Ivanov]] (anglicised as "Eugene"), listed as a naval attach<U+00E9> at the Soviet Embassy.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> British Intelligence ([[MI5]]) knew from the  double-agent [[Oleg Penkovsky]] that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]].<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 74</ref> Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, where he met Keeler and Rice-Davis, and sometimes joined Ward's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage.<ref name= Denning8>Denning, p. 8</ref> MI5 considered Ivanov a potential defector, and sought Ward's help to this end, providing him with a case officer known as "Woods".<ref>Robertson, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref><ref>Summers and Dorril, pp. 24 and 123</ref>  Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a [[Track II diplomacy|backchannel]], through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union,<ref>Robertson, p. 166</ref> and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 105<U+2013>12</ref> His closeness to Ivanov raised concerns about his loyalty; according to [[Lord Denning]]'s September 1963 report, Ivanov often asked Ward questions about British foreign policy, and Ward did his best to provide answers.<ref name= Denning8/>

==Origins==

===Cliveden, July 1961===
[[File:Cliveden, June 2005.JPG|thumb|upright= 1.2|left|Cliveden House, the scene of the swimming-pool party at which Profumo met Keeler]]
During the weekend of 8<U+2013>9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the Cliveden cottage.<ref>Irving et al, pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref> That same weekend, at the main house, John and Valerie Profumo were among the large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]], the president of Pakistan. On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref> Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, "a very pretty girl and very sweet".<ref>Profumo, pp. 157<U+2013>58</ref> Keeler did not know, initially, who Profumo was, but was impressed that he was the husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have "a bit of fun" with him.<ref>Keeler, pp. 110<U+2013>11</ref>

The next afternoon the two parties reconvened at the pool, joined by Ivanov, who had arrived that morning. There followed what Lord Denning described as "a light-hearted and frolicsome bathing party, where everyone was in bathing costumes and nothing indecent took place at all".<ref>Denning, pp. 11<U+2013>12</ref> Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler,<ref>Profumo, p. 161</ref> and promised to be in touch with her. Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where, according to Keeler, they had sex. Most commentators doubt this<U+2014>Keeler was generally outspoken about her conquests, yet said nothing about sex with Ivanov until she informed a newspaper 18 months later.<ref>Davenport-Hines, pp. 248<U+2013>49</ref><ref name=Knightley87/>

On 12 July Ward reported on the weekend's events to MI5.<ref>Robertson, p. 25</ref> He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated that he had been asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of [[West Germany]] with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a [[Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting#Love, honeypots, and recruitment|honey trap operation]] against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, [[Roger Hollis|Sir Roger Hollis]].<ref name= Knightley87/>

===Brief liaison===
A few days after the Cliveden weekend, Profumo contacted Keeler. The affair that ensued was brief; some commentators have suggested that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961.<ref name= Knightley87/><ref name= DH250>Davenport-Hines, pp. 250<U+2013>53</ref><ref name= P165>Profumo, pp. 165<U+2013>66</ref>  The liaison has been characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations, a "screw of convenience",<ref>Summers and Dorril, p. 139</ref> although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer-term commitment and that he offered to set her up in a flat.<ref>Keeler, pp. 127<U+2013>28</ref> More than 20 years later, Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who "seem[ed] to like sexual intercourse", but who was  "completely uneducated", with no conversation beyond make-up, hair and gramophone records.<ref>Profumo, p. 163</ref> 
{{Quote box|width=250px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= "Darling,&nbsp;... Alas something's blown up tomorrow night and I can't therefore make it&nbsp;...

Please take great care of yourself and don't run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love J"|salign = left |source=  From Profumo's "Darling" letter to Keeler, 9 August 1961<ref name= Knightley87/> }}
The couple usually met at Wimpole Mews, when Ward was absent, although once, when Hobson was away, Profumo took Keeler to his home at [[Chester Terrace]] in [[Regent's Park]].<ref name= Knightley87/>  On one occasion he borrowed a [[Bentley]] from his ministerial colleague [[John Hare, 1st Viscount Blakenham|John Hare]] and took Keeler for a drive around London, and another time the couple had a drink with [[George Ward, 1st Viscount Ward of Witley|Viscount Ward]], the former [[Secretary of State for Air]]. During their time together, Profumo gave Keeler a few small presents, and once, a sum of <U+00A3>20 as a gift for her mother.<ref name= DH250/> Keeler maintains that although Stephen Ward asked her to obtain information from Profumo about the deployment of nuclear weapons, she did not do so.<ref>Keeler, p. 126</ref> Profumo was equally adamant that no such discussions took place.<ref>Profumo, p. 164</ref>

On 9 August Profumo was interviewed informally by [[Norman Brook, 1st Baron Normanbrook|Sir Norman Brook]], the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]],<ref name= P165/> who had been advised by Hollis of Profumo's involvement with the Ward circle. Brook warned the minister of the dangers of mixing with Ward's group, since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward's dependability. It is possible that Brook asked Profumo to help MI5 in its efforts to secure Ivanov's defection<U+2014>a request which Profumo declined.<ref name= DH250/>  Although Brook did not indicate knowledge of Profumo's liaison with Keeler, Profumo may have suspected that he knew. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning "Darling&nbsp;...", cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association;<ref name= Knightley87>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 86<U+2013>89</ref> Keeler insists that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 89; Keeler, pp. 126<U+2013>27</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although the general consensus among commentators is that the affair was certainly over by December 1961, at least one person claims to have seen Profumo and Keeler in bed together as late as the summer of 1962.<ref>Summers and Dorril, pp. 153 and 171</ref> |group= n}}

==Developing scandal==

===Gordon and Edgecombe===
[[File:Wimpole Mews - geograph.org.uk - 606645.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wimpole Mews. No. 17 is the flat-roofed, brick-faced house, just visible on the right.]]
In October 1961 Keeler accompanied Ward to [[Notting Hill]], then a run-down district of London replete with West Indian music clubs and cannabis dealers.<ref name= DH250/><ref>Robertson, p. 27</ref> At the Rio Caf<U+00E9> they encountered [[Aloysius Gordon|Aloysius "Lucky" Gordon]], a Jamaican jazz singer with a history of violence and petty crime. He and Keeler embarked on an affair which, in her own accounts, was marked by equal measures of violence and tenderness on his part.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref>  Gordon became very possessive towards Keeler, jealous of her other social contacts. He began confronting her friends, and often telephoned her at unsocial hours. In November Keeler left Wimpole Mews and moved to a flat in [[Dolphin Square]], overlooking the Thames at [[Pimlico]], where she entertained friends and perhaps clients. When Gordon continued to harass her he was arrested by the police and charged with assault. Keeler later agreed to drop the charge.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 102</ref><ref>Summers and Dorril, pp. 69<U+2013>70</ref> 

In July 1962 the first inklings of a possible Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle had been hinted, in coded terms, in the gossip column of the society magazine ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]''. Under the heading "Sentences I'd like to hear the end of" appeared the wording: "...&nbsp;called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur-driven Zils drew up at her ''front'' door, out of her ''back'' door into a chauffeur-driven Humber slipped..."<ref name= Young9>Young, p. 9, quoting from ''Queen''</ref> Keeler was then in New York with Rice-Davies, in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 103<U+2013>04</ref>{{#tag:ref|A year later, at the height of the scandal, this visit was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], in connection with rumours that Keeler had slept with [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]].<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 206<U+2013>07</ref>|group= n}} On her return, to counter Gordon's threats, Keeler formed a relationship with [[Johnny Edgecombe]], an ex-merchant seaman from [[Antigua]], with whom she lived for a while in [[Brentford]], just west of London.<ref name= DH258>Davenport-Hines, p. 258</ref>  Edgecombe was similarly  possessive; he and Gordon clashed  violently on 27 October 1962, when  Edgecombe slashed his rival with a knife.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 117</ref> Keeler broke with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour.<ref name= DH258/>

On 14 December 1962 Keeler and Rice-Davies were together at 17 Wimpole Mews when Edgecombe arrived, demanding to see Keeler. When he was not allowed in, he fired several shots at the front door. Shortly afterwards Edgecombe was arrested and charged with attempted murder and other offences.<ref>Robertson, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref> In brief press accounts, Keeler was described as "a free-lance model" and "Miss Marilyn Davies" as "an actress".<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 121</ref>  In the wake of the incident, Keeler began to talk indiscreetly about Ward, Profumo, Ivanov and the Edgecombe shooting. Among those to whom she told her story was [[John Lewis (UK politician)|John Lewis]], a former [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP whom she had met by chance in a night club. Lewis, a long-standing enemy of Ward, passed the information to his one-time parliamentary colleague George Wigg, who began his own investigation.<ref>Irving et al, pp. 76<U+2013>78</ref>

===Mounting pressures===
On 22 January 1963 the Soviet government, sensing a possible scandal, recalled Ivanov.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 128</ref> Aware of increasing public interest, Keeler attempted to sell her story to the national newspapers.<ref name= DH262>Davenport-Hines, pp. 262<U+2013>63</ref> The Radcliffe tribunal's ongoing inquiry into press behaviour during the Vassall case was making newspapers nervous,<ref>Young, p. 10</ref> and only two showed interest in Keeler's story: the ''[[Sunday Mirror|Sunday Pictorial]]'' and the ''[[News of the World]]''. As the latter would not join an auction, Keeler accepted the ''Pictorial''{{'}}s offer of a <U+00A3>200 down payment and a further <U+00A3>800 when the story was published.<ref>Denning, pp. 21<U+2013>23</ref> The paper retained a copy of the "Darling" letter. The ''News of the World'' then alerted Ward and Astor<U+2014>whose names had been mentioned by Keeler<U+2014>and they in turn informed Profumo.<ref name= DH262/> When Profumo's lawyers tried to persuade Keeler not to publish, the compensation she demanded was so large that Profumo's lawyers considered charges of extortion.<ref name= Robertson34>Robertson, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>  Ward informed the ''Pictorial'' that Keeler's story was largely false, and that he and others would sue if it was printed, whereupon the paper withdrew its offer, although Keeler kept the <U+00A3>200.<ref name= DH262/>

Keeler then gave details of her relationship with Profumo to a police officer, who did not pass on this information to MI5 or the legal authorities.<ref name= Robertson34/><ref name= Parris159>Parris, p. 159</ref> By this time, many of Profumo's political colleagues had heard rumours of his entanglement, and of the existence of a potentially incriminating letter. Nevertheless, his denials were accepted by the government's principal law officers and the Conservative [[Chief Whip]], although with some private scepticism.<ref>Davenport-Hines, pp. 264<U+2013>67</ref>  Macmillan, mindful of the injustice done to Galbraith on the basis of rumours, was determined to support his minister, and took no action.<ref name= Parris159/>{{#tag:ref|On 4 March a fairly explicit summary of the allegations surrounding Profumo was published by [[Andrew Roth]] in his newsletter ''Westminster Confidential'', but Profumo was advised by his lawyers not to sue, since the circulation of the sheet was insignificant.<ref>Davenport-Hines, pp. 268<U+2013>69</ref><ref>Parris, p. 160</ref>|group= n}}

Edgecombe's trial began on 14 March but Keeler, one of the Crown's key witnesses, was missing. She had, without informing the court, gone to Spain, although at this stage her whereabouts were unknown. Her unexplained absence caused a press sensation.<ref name= Knightley149>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 149<U+2013>50</ref> Every newspaper knew the rumours linking Keeler with Profumo, but refrained from reporting any direct connection; in the wake of the Radcliffe inquiry they were, in Wigg's later words, "willing to wound but afraid to strike".<ref name= Y14>Young, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref> They could only hint, by front-page juxtapositions of stories and photographs, that Profumo might be connected to Keeler's disappearance.<ref>Irving et al, p. 90</ref> Despite her absence the judge proceeded with the case; Edgecombe was found guilty on a lesser charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.<ref name= Knightley149/> A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: "Mr James Montesi", "Miss Gaye Funloving", "Dr Spook" and "Vladimir Bolokhov".<ref name= Y14/>

===Personal statement===

The newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party, [[Harold Wilson]], was initially advised by his colleagues to have nothing to do with Wigg's private dossier on the Profumo rumours.<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 271</ref> On 21 March, with the press furore over the "missing witness" at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used [[parliamentary privilege]] to ask the [[Home Secretary]] to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting "a minister" to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting.<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|title= Journalists (Imprisonment)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/mar/21/journalists-imprisonment#S5CV0674P0_19630321_HOC_512|volume= 674|pages= col. 723<U+2013>25|date= 21 March 1963}}</ref> He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House.<ref name= Irving100/> Later in the debate [[Barbara Castle]], the Labour MP for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]], referred to the "missing witness" and hinted at a possible perversion of justice.<ref name= Irving100>Irving et al, pp 100<U+2013>01</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|title= Journalists (Imprisonment)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/mar/21/journalists-imprisonment#S5CV0674P0_19630321_HOC_512|volume= 674|pages= col. 737<U+2013>40|date= 21 March 1963}}</ref> The Home Secretary, [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should "seek other means of making these insinuations if they are prepared to substantiate them".<ref>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|title= Journalists (Imprisonment)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/mar/21/journalists-imprisonment#S5CV0674P0_19630321_HOC_512|volume= 674|pages= col. 758|date= 22 March 1963}}</ref>

At the conclusion of the debate  the government's law officers and Chief Whip met, and decided that Profumo should assert his innocence in a personal statement to the House. Such statements are, by long-standing tradition, made on the particular honour of the member and are accepted by the House without question.<ref name= Y17/> In the early hours of 22 March Profumo and his lawyers met with ministers  and together agreed an appropriate wording. Later that morning Profumo made his statement to a crowded House. He acknowledged friendships with Keeler and Ward, the former of whom, he said, he had last seen in December 1961.

==Exposure==

===Investigation and resignation===
Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward appeared on [[ITN|Independent Television News]], where he endorsed Profumo's statement and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as "baseless".<ref>Irving et al, p. 110</ref> Ward's own activities had become a matter of official concern, and on 1 April the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone<U+2014>this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke.<ref name= Robertson44>Robertson, pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref> Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 166<U+2013>67</ref> The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to [[Holloway Prison]] for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward.<ref name= Robertson44/><ref>Parris, pp. 164<U+2013>65</ref> Meanwhile Profumo was awarded costs and <U+00A3>50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.<ref>Denning, p. 63</ref>
This did not deter ''Private Eye'' from including "Sextus Profano" in their parody of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.<ref>Profumo, p. 186</ref><ref name= Econ>{{cite journal|title= Why the Profumo affair made the perfect political scandal|url= http://www.economist.com/node/5637716|journal= The Economist|date= 16 March 2006}}</ref>  

On 18 April Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 170<U+2013>71</ref> The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, [[Timothy Bligh]], to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action.<ref name= DH287>Davenport-Hines, pp. 287<U+2013>89</ref><ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 177<U+2013>78</ref> On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry.<ref>Robertson, p. 46</ref> Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne|Lord Dilhorne]], to inquire into possible security breaches.<ref name= DH287/>

On 31 May, at the start of the parliamentary [[Whitsun]] recess, the Profumos flew to Venice for a short holiday. At their hotel they received a message asking him to return as soon as possible. Believing that his bluff had been called, Profumo then told his wife the truth, and they decided to return immediately. They found that Macmillan was on holiday in Scotland. On Tuesday 4 June Profumo confessed the truth to Bligh, confirming that he had lied, and resigned from the government and from Parliament. Bligh informed Macmillan of these events by telephone. The resignation was announced on 5 June, when the formal exchange of letters between Profumo and Macmillan was published.<ref>Davenport-Hines, pp. 290<U+2013>91</ref><ref name= Irving137>Irving et al, pp. 137<U+2013>38</ref>{{#tag:ref|Macmillan's reply to Profumo's resignation, sent from his holiday address in [[Argyllshire]], begins: "The contents of your letter of June 4 have been communicated to me...", indicated that Profumo's letter was read to him over the phone.<ref name= Irving137/>|group= n}} ''The Times'' called Profumo's lies "a great tragedy for the probity of public life in Britain";<ref>{{cite newspaper|title= A Shocking Admission|newspaper= The Times|date= 6 June 1963|page= 13}}</ref> the ''Daily Mail'' recorded Profumo's fall and disgrace as the price required when public figures fell short of the expected standards of integrity. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' hinted that not all the truth had been told, and referred to "skeletons in many cupboards".<ref>Young, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>

===Retribution===

Gordon's trial for the attack on Keeler began on the day Profumo's resignation was made public. He maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years' imprisonment.<ref>Irving et al, p. 148</ref> The following day, Ward was arrested and charged with immorality offences.<ref>Irving, p. 149</ref> On 9 June, freed from Profumo's libel threats, The ''News of the World'' published "The Confessions of Christine", an account which helped to fashion the public image of Ward as a sexual predator and probable  tool of the Soviets.<ref name= Robertson52>Robertson, pp. 52<U+2013>55</ref> The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' (formerly the ''Sunday Pictorial'') printed Profumo's "Darling" letter.<ref>Young, pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref>
{{Quote box|width=250px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=left|quote=  "I myself feel that the time will come very soon when my right hon.

In advance of the House of Commons debate on Profumo's resignation, due 17 June, David Watt in ''The Spectator'' defined Macmillan's position as "an intolerable dilemma from which he can only escape by being proved either ludicrously na<U+00EF>ve or incompetent or deceitful<U+2014>or all three".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Watt|first= David|title= The Price of Profumo|url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/14th-june-1963/4/political-commentary|journal= The Spectator|date= 13 June 1963|page= p. 4}}</ref> Meanwhile, the press speculated about possible Cabinet resignations, and several ministers felt it necessary to demonstrate their loyalty to the prime minister.<ref>Young, pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref> In a BBC interview on 13 June [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], holder of several ministerial offices, denounced Profumo in a manner which, according to ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s reporter, "had to be seen to be believed".<ref>{{cite newspaper|authorlink= Maurice Richardson|last= Richardson|first= Maurice|title= Lord Hailsham Hits His Wicket|newspaper= The Observer|date= 16 June 1963|page = 25}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Hailsham's performance was generally condemned by opponents and colleagues.<ref>Levin, p. 65</ref>  In the subsequent Commons debate he was described by Wigg as "a lying humbug" (Davenport-Hines wrongly ascribes this comment to [[Reginald Paget, Baron Paget of Northampton|Reginald Paget]]).<ref name= Hansard>{{cite journal|journal= Hansard|title= Security (Mr Profumo's Resignation)|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1963/jun/17/security-mr-profumos-resignation#S5CV0679P0_19630617_HOC_296|volume= 679|pages= cols. 34<U+2013>176 |date= 17 June 1963}}</ref><ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 301</ref>|group= n}} Hailsham insisted that "a great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proven liar".<ref>Young, p. 34</ref>

In the debate, Wilson concentrated almost exclusively on the extent to which the prime minister and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo's association with Ward and his circle.<ref>Young, pp. 42<U+2013>46</ref> Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence. He mentioned the false allegations against Galbraith, and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him.<ref>Young, pp. 50<U+2013>52</ref> In the general debate the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed; [[Nigel Birch, Baron Rhyl|Nigel Birch]], the Conservative MP for [[West Flintshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Flintshire]], referred to Keeler as a "professional prostitute" and asked rhetorically: "What are whores about?"<ref name= KK195/> Keeler was otherwise branded a "tart" and a "poor little slut".{{#tag:ref|The "poor little slut" comment was made by [[Ben Parkin]], the Labour MP for [[Paddington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Paddington North]], in a speech that was generally sympathetic to Keeler and "the many other women like her", and condemned the "Pharisaical denunciations" of other members.<ref name= Hansard/><ref>Young, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>|group= n}}  Ward  was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent; one Conservative referred to "the treason of Dr Ward".<ref name= Robertson52/> Most Conservatives, whatever their reservations, were supportive of Macmillan, with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement.<ref name= KK195>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 195</ref> In the subsequent vote on the government's handling of the affair, 27 Conservatives abstained, reducing the government's majority to 69. Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant, and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 196</ref><ref>Irving et al, pp. 175<U+2013>76</ref>

After the parliamentary debate, newspapers published further sensational stories, hinting at widespread immorality within Britain's governing class. A story emanating from Rice-Davies concerned a naked masked man, who acted as a waiter at sex parties; rumours suggested that he was a cabinet minister, or possibly a member of the Royal Family.<ref>Parris, p. 168</ref> [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] in the ''Sunday Mirror'' wrote of "The Slow, Sure Death of the Upper Classes".<ref>Davenport-Hines, pp. 306<U+2013>08</ref><ref name= Muggeridge>{{cite newspaper|authorlink= Malcolm Muggeridge|last= Muggeridge|first= Malcolm|title= The Slow, Sure Death of the Upper Classes|newspaper= Sunday Mirror|date= 23 June 1963|page= 7}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Muggeridge wrote: "The Upper Classes have always been given to lying, fornication, corrupt practices and, doubtless as a result of the public school system, sodomy".<ref name= Muggeridge/>|group= n}} On 21 June Macmillan instructed [[Lord Denning]],  the [[Master of the Rolls]], to investigate and report on the growing range of rumours.<ref>Denning, p. 1</ref> Ward's committal proceedings began a week later, at Marylebone magistrates' court, where the Crown's evidence was fully reported in the press.<ref>Robertson, pp. 55<U+2013>64</ref> Ward was committed for trial on charges of living off immoral earnings and of procuring, and released on bail.<ref>Summers and Dorril, p. 281</ref>

With the Ward case now ''[[sub judice]]'', the press pursued  related stories. ''The People'' reported that [[Scotland Yard]] had begun an inquiry, in parallel with Denning's, into "homosexual practices as well as sexual laxity" among civil servants, military officers and MPs.<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 311</ref> On 24 June the ''Daily Mirror'', under a banner heading "Prince Philip and the Profumo Scandal", dismissed what it termed the "foul rumour" that the prince had been involved in the affair, without disclosing the nature of the rumour.<ref>Parris, p. 169</ref><ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 344</ref>

Ward's trial began at the [[Old Bailey]] on 28 July. He was charged with living off the immoral earnings of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 to have sex with other persons.<ref>Irving, pp. 193<U+2013>94</ref>  The thrust of the prosecution's case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their immoral earnings. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around <U+00A3>5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time.<ref>Robertson, pp. 80<U+2013>81</ref> In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel [[Mervyn Griffith-Jones]] portrayed Ward as representing "the very depths of lechery and depravity".<ref>Davenport-Hines, p. 324</ref> The judge, [[Archibald Pellow Marshall|Sir Archie Marshall]], was equally hostile, drawing particular attention to the fact that none of Ward's supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, p. 243</ref> Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon's conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon's witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon's trial.<ref>Robertson, pp. 92<U+2013>95 and 101</ref> 

After listening to Marshall's damning summing-up, on the evening of 30 July Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day he was found guilty ''in absentia'' on the charges relating to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and acquitted on the other counts. Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness.<ref>Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 243<U+2013>47</ref>{{#tag:ref|In the 1989 edition of their book ''Honeytrap'', Summers and Dorril add a postscript that provides extra details of Ward's last hours, his movements and his visitors.

The main motive for the killing was, supposedly, Ward's continuing ability to embarrass the government and the Royal family. There is no direct evidence to support this story. The reporter [[Tom Mangold]], one of the last to see Ward alive, dismisses the murder theory, while allowing that there are unexplained circumstances relating to Ward's death.<ref>Summers and Dorril, pp. 316<U+2013>23</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|last= Tweedie|first= Neil|title= The Profumo Affair: 'It was decided that Stephen Ward had to die<U+2019>|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10488686/The-Profumo-Affair-It-was-decided-that-Stephen-Ward-had-to-die.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 2 December 1913}}</ref> |group= n}}

In April 1964 he began working as a volunteer at the [[Toynbee Hall]] settlement, a charitable organisation based in [[Spitalfields]] which supports the most deprived residents in the East End of London.

==Dramatisations==
There have been several dramatised versions of the Profumo affair. The 1989 film  ''[[Scandal (1989 film)|Scandal]]'' featured [[Ian McKellen]] as Profumo and [[John Hurt]] as Ward.
