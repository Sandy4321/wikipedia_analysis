===Membership History===
The Mid American Conference charter members were [[Ohio University]], [[Butler University]], [[University of Cincinnati]], [[Wayne State University]] and [[Western Reserve]]. [[Wayne State University]] never participated and quickly bowed out. Butler left after the 1st year. [[Miami University]] and [[Western Michigan University]] took the place of those charter members for the [[1948]] season. By the time the [[University of Cincinnati]] left after the 1952/53 season, the MAC had already added [[University of Toledo]] ([[1950]]), [[Kent State University]] ([[1951]]), and [[Bowling Green State University]] ([[1952]]). 

The membership stayed steady for the next couple decades except for addition of [[Marshall University]] in [[1954]]. Marshall was kicked out of the conference in [[1969]]. The first major expansion since the 50's took place in the mid seventies with the addition of [[Northern Illinois University]], [[Ball State University]], [[Eastern Michigan University]] and [[Central Michigan University]]. NIU left after the 1986 season. University of Akron joined the conference in 1992. The conference became the largest Division 1A with the re-admittance of Marshall and NIU and addition of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]'s [[Buffalo Bulls]] in 1997 and 1998 respectively. The [[University of Central Florida]] joined in the 2001 to become the MAC first Football Only school to join the conference.

Two schools left the conference after the 2004-05 academic year&mdash;[[Marshall University]], an all-sports member, and the [[University of Central Florida]] (UCF), a football-only member. Both schools, which played in the MAC East Division, joined [[Conference USA]] in all sports.

In May 2005, [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania signed an initial six-year contract with the MAC as a football-only school which will eventually play in the East Division. Over the next three seasons, Temple's schedule of league games will gradually increase: 4 in 2005, 6 in 2006, 8 (a full schedule) in 2007. Due to Temple's partial league schedule in 2005 and 2006, the football program will have only associate membership in the league. According to the league's press release on the matter, Temple will be eligible for one of the league's two bowl tie-ins, and participate in the league's television arrangement, beginning immediately. Eligibility to compete in the MAC Championship Game, however, does not come until 2007. Presumably, this means they are also ineligible to win a Division Championship, although it is conceivable that, with a win percentage equal to or better than that of the best team in the division playing a full league schedule, they could be declared Divisional (co-)champions but ineligible to represent their Division in the Championship Game; the league has not made this distinction clear yet.

[[Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne|IPFW]] is an affiliate member in tennis and men's soccer. Another affiliate member is [[Missouri State University]] in field hockey. 

Member schools participate in [[baseball]], men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's [[cross-country running|cross-country]], [[field hockey]], [[American football]], men's and women's [[golf]], women's [[gymnastics]], men's and women's [[football (soccer)|soccer]], [[softball]], men's and women's [[swimming]], men's and women's [[tennis]], men's and women's [[athletics|track]], women's [[volleyball]] and [[sport wrestling|wrestling]].

The MAC is contracted to provide a team for three college football bowl games&mdash;the [[GMAC Bowl]], [[Motor City Bowl]], and the [[International Bowl]]. In the event that a Big East team cannot be provided for the newly created [[Birmingham Bowl]], a fourth MAC team is selected.
