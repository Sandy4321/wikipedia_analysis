==Origin==
The Amul girl was created as a response to Amul's rival brand Polson's butter-girl. The idea was conceived in 1967 once ASP (Advertising, Sales and Promotion) clinched the brand portfolio from the previous agency FCB Ulka. It was executed by Sylvester Da Cunha, the owner of the agency and his art director Eustace Fernandez on hoardings, painted bus panels and posters in [[Mumbai]]. The mascot, since then, has been mobilized to comment on many events of national and political importance like [[Emergency_(India)|Emergency in India]] in 1976.<ref name=Trans>{{cite book|title=Transmission System Design|publisher=Nirali Prakashan|isbn=81-85790-96-5}}</ref>

==Development==

In 1966, Amul decided to give their account to the [[Advertising agency]] called Advertising and Sales Promotion (ASP) to work on their ad campaign. Sylvester da Cunha, then the managing director of the agency and Eustace Fernandez, art director decided to create something that would grab the attention of every housewife in the country.<ref>http://www.amul.tv/amultv/aboutus.html</ref> [[Verghese Kurien|Dr Verghese Kurien]], then chairman of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (GCMMF) suggested a mischievous little girl as a mascot with two requirements. It had to be easy to draw and memorable as most of the advertising would be outdoor media which required hand painting in those days and the hoardings had to be changed frequently.<ref name="The Amul girl">{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/news/27685971_1_plans-board-amul-girl-amul-moppet|title=The Amul girl|date=Oct 5, 2007|publisher=Economic Times|language=english|accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref>

The Shiv Sena people said that if we didn't do something about removing the ad they would come and destroy Amul's office.Also Amul's Mr Coffee was in controversy.
