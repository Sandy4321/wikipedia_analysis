==Early life and career==

Dolores Alexander was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], where she attended [[Catholic school]]. In 1961 she graduated from [[City College of New York]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Language and Literature. During her senior year she worked at ''[[The New York Times]]'' as a intern reporter for 10 months, gaining experience in journalism and her first taste of sexism within the news field: while applying for positions at the ''Times'', she was not hired as a "copy girl" by a male employee because it would "cause a revolution in the newsroom".<ref name=death/> Upon graduation, she worked as a reporter, [[copy editor]] and [[News bureau|bureau chief]] at the ''[[Newark Evening News]]'' from 1961<U+2013>1964. She then went on to serve as a reporter, copy editor and assistant women's editor at ''[[Newsday]]'', also serving as a feature writer for the publication's weekend magazine until 1969.<ref name="Papers">{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Dolores Alexander Papers | work=Sophia Smith Collection | publisher=Smith College | url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss427_admin.html | accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}</ref>

==Feminism==

<blockquote>Until that time I had always felt like a weirdo, the only person who felt out of step with the world around her. I knew we needed a women's movement. This is what I had been waiting for. <U+2013> Dolores Alexander, 2007.<ref name=death/></blockquote>

In 1966, while working at ''Newsday'', Alexander came across a [[press release]] announcing the creation of a new [[women's rights]] organization: the [[National Organization of Women]] (NOW). She interviewed [[Betty Friedan]]<ref name=death/> and with her media experience, she became chair of the Monitor Subcommittee of the National Task Force on Image of Women in Mass Media. In 1969 she became the first Executive Director of NOW. She established the headquarters in [[New York City]], and served as an editor of NOW's national newsletter, ''NOW Acts''. She offered to pay the $5 dues for women who could not afford to become members,<ref name=death/> and fronted a campaign to boost membership nationwide.

In May 1970, she resigned as director to protest against NOW's [[homophobic]] practices and policies.<ref name="Papers"/> Even in her later years, she continued to be disgruntled by the negativity that the words "lesbian" and "feminist" had within the early organization, believing the terms were being used like {{"'}}weapons' to undercut NOW members".<ref name=death/> Alexander continued to lecture about women's rights and worked with the [[New Feminist Talent Collective]], which was formed by [[Jaqui Michot Ceballos]] to provide the services of speakers about the women's movement.  She co-founded and organized [[Women Against Pornography]] and worked with [[New York Radical Feminists]]. Alexander served as board member for the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|National Association for Repeal of Abortion Laws]], an advisory board member for the New York NOW chapter and was a member of the [[New York Newspaper Women's Club]]. Alexander was a notable figure in numerous events in the women's movement. She helped integrate the [[Second-wave_feminism#1967|want ads]] in ''The New York Times'', the lesbian purge of the National Organization of Women,{{discuss}} 1977's [[National Women's Conference]] in Houston, and the UN's [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in [[Beijing]] in 1995{{Dubious|date=September 2011}}.{{citation needed|date = September 2011}}

===Mother Courage===

In 1972, Alexander and Jill Ward opened "Mother Courage", a feminist restaurant in [[Greenwich Village]], New York. The first feminist restaurant in the United States, it inspired three other feminist restaurants to open in the country during its first three years. The restaurant was named after [[Mother Courage]], a character in a play by [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Their lack of restaurant experience made it difficult to obtain a bank loan, leading them to borrow money from friends to renovate a run-down [[luncheonette]]. Men and women attended the restaurant, and women took priority. Wine was poured for women to taste rather than their male guests, and checks were placed within equal distance of diners. The restaurant encouraged women to dine alone, creating a safe haven, allowing a solo diner to know "she won't feel like a freak and won't get hassled by men". Author [[Lucy Komisar]] described "Mother Courage" as "More than a restaurant, this is part of a social movement."<ref name="Mother1">{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Dolores Alexander oral history | work= | publisher=Voices of Feminism Oral History Project| url=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CC4QFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smith.edu%2Flibrary%2Flibs%2Fssc%2Fvof%2Ftranscripts%2FAlexander.pdf&rct=j&q=dolores%20alexander%201931%20feminist&ei=k2hGTumZD8Xk0QHxz92ICA&usg=AFQjCNEUvPbBTGC4Ry7d8Zew0ubT4cbzKw&sig2=_ElFGpLi4yiYhJ1oSQ2pzw&cad=rja | accessdate=13 Aug 2011}}</ref>

==Later life and legacy==

In 2003, Alexander donated some of her papers to the [[Sophia Smith Collection]] at [[Smith College]];<ref name="Papers"/> the [[Schlesinger Library]] at [[Harvard University]] has another collection of her papers. As her health declined, she stepped back from the movement spotlight, preferring to watch a new generation of activists "lead the change". On May 13, 2008, Alexander died in [[Palm Harbor, Florida]].<ref name=death>{{cite news | url=http://www2.timesreview.com/ST/Stories/T052208_Alexander_jal | title=Feminist leader dies at 76 | last=Lane | first=Julie | date=2008 June 27 | work= | publisher=The Suffolk Times | pages= | accessdate=13 August 2011 }}</ref>
