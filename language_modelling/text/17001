"'''True Blue'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. It was released as the third single from her third studio album, ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'', on September 29, 1986 by [[Sire Records]]. Originally written by Steve Bray, the song deals with the feelings of Madonna for her then-husband [[Sean Penn]]. A [[dance-pop]] song, it features instrumentation from a [[rhythm guitar]], a [[synthesizer]], [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, and [[drum]]s. The main chorus is backed by an alternate one incorporating a [[Chord (music)|chord progression]] generally seen in [[doo-wop]] type of music.

Received by the critics as a light-hearted and cute retro song, "True Blue" topped the charts in UK, Ireland and Canada and became another consecutive top ten song in U.S. for Madonna by reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The original music video portrayed her again with a new look, leaner and sporting platinum blond bushy hair. An alternate video was made through the "Make My Video" contest on [[MTV]]. The final selected videos had a similar theme of 50s inspired setting and the storyline following the lyrics of the song. "True Blue" was performed only once on the subsequent [[Who's That Girl World Tour]].

==Writing and inspiration==
The song was written and produced by [[Stephen Bray]] with a co-writing credit by Madonna.<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=119}}</ref> According to Madonna, "True Blue" takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband [[Sean Penn]] and to his very pure vision of love<ref name="metz"/> and was a direct tribute to him as well as the album, which was as a whole inspired by her "unabashed valentine" for Penn.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=789}}</ref> In an interview, Bray said, "She (Madonna) was very much in love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs."<ref>{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=43}}</ref>

==Composition==

"True Blue" is a [[dance-pop]] song inspired by the [[Motown]]'s [[girl group]]s from the 1960s which are considered the direct antecedents of Madonna's musical sound.<ref name="metz">{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=48}}</ref> The song is composed in the key of [[B major]].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[Davitt Sigerson]] from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in a review of the album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' said that the song "squanders a classic beat and an immensely promising title",<ref name="rolls">{{cite web|first=Davitt|last=Sigerson|authorlink=Davitt Sigerson|url=|title=Madonna: True Blue: Music Reviews|date=1986-07-17|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=RealNetworks, Inc}}</ref> [[Yahoo!

In another context, it's a counterpoint harmonic blanket, twirling with star-spangled timbre and dynamic drive."<ref name="dean"/> Rikky Rooksby, in his book ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', said that "True Blue" is "a song that is merely cute and not really up to being the title track of an album".<ref name="Rooksby"/>

==Music video==

=== Official version ===
[[File:Truebluem.jpeg|thumb|Madonna sporting a blond bushy haircut, drives a 1957 Ford Thunderbird convertible with her girlfriends in the back, in the 50s inspired blue themed video for "True Blue"]]  
"True Blue" had two music videos to accompany it. Shot in early September 1986 in [[New York]], Madonna's own video for the song was directed by [[James Foley]], who worked with Madonna in her videos for "[[Live to Tell]]" and "[[Papa Don't Preach]]", produced by Robert Colesberry and David Massar with photography by [[Michael Ballhaus]]. The Foley version features Madonna with three dancers and a 1950s car in an all-blue [[diner]]. Madonna changes her hairstyle from short-cropped in "[[Papa Don't Preach]]" to a bushy platinum blonde hairdo and sings the song in choreographed moves backed by her dancers. It displays a flashing back to fifties [[rock and roll|rock'n'roll]] youth culture.<ref name=carol>{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=49}}</ref>

The blue background changes to a sunny one as she sings "The sun is bursting right out of the sky" to go-along with the lyrical meaning of the song. Two of Madonna's close friends, [[Erika Belle]] and [[Debi Mazar]] appear in the video. The video was released at a time when she was going through a failed marriage with then husband actor [[Sean Penn]]. During this period, Madonna focused on more traditional fashion and attitudes and tried to appear more respectful of traditional gender roles. After shedding her trampy sex-kitten and boy-toy image with the "[[Live to Tell]]" music video, Madonna again adopted a new look for this video.<ref>{{harvnb|Peach|1998|p=176}}</ref> Madonna attended aerobics classes at [[Hollywood]] health centre ''The Sports Connection'', which was responsible for her toned down look in the video.<ref name=carol/>

==="Make My Video" contest===
[[Sire Records]] decided to opt for a promotional device in the United States that would involve [[MTV]] viewers to make their own videos for "True Blue". In the fall of 1986, MTV asked its viewers to submit their own videos. The contest was known as "Madonna's 'Make My Video' Contest". The winner was awarded a trip to MTV's [[New York City|New York]] studio where Madonna presented a $25,000 check live on MTV.<ref>{{cite news|first=Guy D.|last=Garcia|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962763,00.html|title=People of Time|date=1986-11-03|accessdate=2009-03-31|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}</ref> Thousands of viewers submitted their recorded tapes which were mainly made using home-made video equipment and featured themselves or relatives as the actors.<ref name=lisa>{{harvnb|Lewis|1991|p=206}}</ref> MTV publicist [[Peter Danielson]] said that many of the submissions featured teenagers imitating Madonna. All the entries were shown in a continuous run on MTV as promised. The same song was played over and over for the whole day, but each time with a different video made by the finalists.<ref>{{cite web|first=Lyndsey|last=Parker|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/videogaga/7748/most-memorable-madonna-moments-46-50/|date=2008-08-07|title=Most Memorable Madonna Moments: 46-50|accessdate=2009-03-31|work=[[Yahoo! Music]]|publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Inc]]}}</ref> Author Lisa A. Lewis said that this event emphasized the effect Madonna had on different kind of audiences due to the popularity and response to the contest. <!-- role as purveyor of multiple audience feelings -->MTV selected ten finalists based mainly on a standard of [[popularity]] rather than slickness of production or concept creativity.<ref name=lisa/>

The concepts used in the videos were wide ranging and included a number of different ideas to interpret the [[lyrics|lyrical meaning]] of the song. The final three entries selected, portrayed a fifties-style production referring to the [[Theme (music)|thematic]] content of the song. The song's narration  about "True Love" formed the basis of the rest of the semi-finalist videos but was used in very different ways. The videos were choreographed featuring [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual romance]], though no particular male or female protagonist was singled out. Some even adopted a kind of [[Sound collage|literal montage]] technique rather than structuring the video around a narrative line.<ref name=lisa/>

The winning entry was by [[Angel Gracia]] and Cliff Guest and it showed the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being supported and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a "perfect boy" (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket over his shoulder and walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, U.S.-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of [[Tina Turner]]'s 1984 single "[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]".<ref name=lisa/>

Madonna performed the song only once on her 1987 "[[Who's That Girl World Tour]]". She came up on the stage wearing a blue dress to sing the song after finishing a performance of "[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]". In a similar setting to the original music video of the song, Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance.<ref>{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=29}}</ref> Her dance in the performance (and also some other performances in the tour) was choreographed by [[Jeffrey Hornaday]] from ''[[Flashdance]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=526}}</ref> Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos: ''Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan'', filmed in [[Tokyo]], Japan, on June 22, 1987,<ref>{{cite video|people=Madonna|title=Who's That Girl <U+2013> Live in Japan|medium=VHS|publisher=Warner-Pioneer Japan|date=1987}}</ref> and ''[[Ciao, Italia! <U+2013> Live from Italy]]'', filmed in [[Turin]], Italy, on September 4, 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Phares|first=Heather|title=allmusic ((( Ciao Italia: Live in Italy (Video) > Overview )))|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r86678|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> [[Pennsylvania]] based [[Pop punk|pop-punk]] band [[Digger (band)|Digger]] recorded a version for their first [[LP record|LP]] ''Powerbait'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p480914|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Digger > Overview )))|accessdate=2009-04-01 |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>
