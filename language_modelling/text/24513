He was the first pick of the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]] and one of the leading scorers during the [[2005-06 NHL season]], finishing 6th in scoring with 102 points (39 G, 63 A). Crosby was one of the most highly regarded draft picks in hockey history, leading many to refer to the 2005 Draft Lottery as the 'Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes'.<ref name="year in review">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref> During this interview, Crosby commented about hard work and success,   "They say you have to do your best and work hard and things will happen. You can make it if you try."
At fourteen, he appeared on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's]] [[Hockey Day in Canada]].<ref name="halifax"/> In that same year, he also led his Midget AAA team, the Dartmouth Subways, to the national championship game. He won both the MVP Award and the Top Scorer Award after scoring 18 points in five games.<ref name="sid facts"/> Despite his many awards, Crosby, like [[Mario Lemieux]], was denied access to enter the QMJHL a year early. After being denied, he went to [[Shattuck-Saint Mary's|Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School]] in Minnesota. While there, he led the Sabres to the U.S. National Championship.

Crosby was selected first overall in the midget draft by the [[Rimouski Oc<U+00E9>anic]] of the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League|QMJHL]].<ref name="sid facts"/> In his first game in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, he scored one goal and added two assists.<ref name="first qmjhl game">{{cite web

During his amateur years, Crosby caught the attention of several journalists and other players, including [[Wayne Gretzky]] himself. When Gretzky was asked if he thought anyone could break his records, he answered that Sidney Crosby could, and added that Crosby was the best player he had seen since [[Mario Lemieux]].<ref name="sid facts"/> 

Crosby was only the fifth player to represent Canada at the [[World Junior Hockey Championships]] as a 16-year old (in 2003). This feat was also accomplished by [[Jay Bouwmeester]], [[Jason Spezza]], [[Eric Lindros]], and [[Wayne Gretzky]], previously.

==NHL career==

===2005-2006 Season===

Sidney Crosby was selected first overall in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] on [[July 30]], [[2005]]. Due to the [[2004-05 NHL lockout|labour stoppage]] in the previous season, the 2005 draft was conducted via a weighted lottery based on each team's playoff appearances and draft lottery victories in the last four years. This lottery system led to the draft being popularly referred to as the Sidney Crosby Lottery or the Sidney Crosby Sweepstakes. <ref name="year in review"/> 

Crosby played his first professional NHL game on [[October 5]], [[2005]] against the [[New Jersey Devils]], and registered an assist on the team's first goal of the season, scored by [[Mark Recchi]] in a 5-1 loss.<ref name="first game">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref> Upon his entry into the NHL, Crosby had the opportunity to play alongside hockey great [[Mario Lemieux]]. Unfortunately, Lemieux was forced to retire after being diagnosed with an [[irregular heartbeat]].<ref name="mario retires">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref> On [[December 16]], [[2005]], [[Michel Therrien]] named Crosby as an alternate captain for the Penguins. The move drew criticism from some hockey pundits, including [[Don Cherry (ice hockey)|Don Cherry]], who claimed that Crosby had done nothing to earn the position.<ref name="cherry captain">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2006-11-17}}</ref>

Crosby finished his rookie season with the franchise record in assists (63) and points (102) for a rookie, both of which had been previously held by [[Mario Lemieux]]. Crosby is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to score 100 points in a single season, and only the seventh rookie ever to hit the benchmark.<ref name="crosby lesson">{{cite web

Among Canadian NHL players, he trailed only [[Joe Thornton]] and [[Dany Heatley]]. While both Crosby and [[Alexander Ovechkin]] of the [[Washington Capitals]] had solid rookie campaigns, Crosby finished second behind Ovechkin for the [[Calder Memorial Trophy]].

Through his first season, Crosby was accused by opposing players and coaches of taking dives and complaining to officials, which has been attributed to his youth.<ref name = "crybaby">{{cite web

Hockey analyst [[Kelly Hrudey]] compared Crosby to Gretzky, who had a similar reputation as a "whiner" in his youth, and suggested that as Crosby matured, he would mellow out and his reputation would fade.<ref name = "review"/>

===2006-2007 Season===

In his sophomore NHL season, Crosby continued to build upon his rookie successes.  On [[October 28]], [[2006]], Crosby netted his first NHL [[hat trick]] in an 8-2 victory over the [[Philadelphia Flyers]].<ref name = "hat trick">{{cite web

Crosby finished the [[2006-07 NHL season]] with 36 goals and 84 assists in 79 games. Being only 19 years old at the time, he thus became the youngest player in NHL history to win the [[Art Ross Trophy]] and the youngest scoring champion in any major North American professional sport.<ref name="Youngest Scoring Champ">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=298728|title=Penguins' Crosby captures Art Ross Trophy as NHL scoring champion|accessdate=2007-04-09|publisher=NHL.com|year=2007|author=NHL.com}}</ref>
