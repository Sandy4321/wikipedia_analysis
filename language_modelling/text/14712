The '''Purple Thorn''' (''Selenia tetralunaria'')) is a [[moth]] of the family [[Geometridae]]. It is a species of northern and central [[Europe]]. It has a scattered distribution in [[Great Britain|Britain]] but is absent from [[Ireland]].

This species is dark purplish-brown, paler towards the [[Glossary of Lepidopteran terms|termen]], with a dark spot at the apex of the forewing. Both wings are marked with a comma-shaped white mark. The margins of the [[insect wing|wings]] are angular, giving the species a distinctive shape. Two broods are produced each year and they differ considerably in size and colour. Adults of the spring brood, which fly in April and May, have a [[wingspan]] of 46<U+2013>52 mm. Moths of the summer brood, flying in July and August,{{ref|flight_season}} are smaller (wingspan 44<U+2013>46 mm) and darker. The species flies at night and is attracted to light.

The [[caterpillar]] feeds on a variety of [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s (see list below). The species overwinters as a [[pupa]].
