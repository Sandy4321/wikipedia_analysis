Evolution is the product of two opposing forces: processes that constantly introduce [[Genetic variation|variation]] in traits, and processes that make particular variants become more common or rare. A trait is a particular characteristic, such as eye color, height, or a behavior, that is expressed when an organism's [[gene]]s interact with its environment. Genes vary within populations, so organisms show heritable differences (variation) in their traits. The main cause of variation is [[mutation]], which changes the sequence of a gene. Altered genes, or [[allele]]s, are then inherited by offspring. There can sometimes also be [[horizontal gene transfer|transfer of genes between species]].<ref name="pmid10097118">{{Citation |last1=Jain | first1=R. | last2=Rivera | first2=M.C. | last3=Lake | first3=J.A. |title=Horizontal gene transfer among genomes: the complexity hypothesis. |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=96 |issue=7 |pages=3801<U+2013>6 |year=1999 |pmid=10097118 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.7.3801 |pmc=22375 |postscript=.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Richardson, Aaron O. and Jeffrey D.

Two main processes cause variants to become more common or rare in a population. One is [[natural selection]], through which traits that aid survival and reproduction become more common, while traits that hinder survival and reproduction become more rare.<ref name=Futuyma/><ref name="Lande">{{cite journal |author=Lande R, Arnold SJ |year=1983 |title=The measurement of selection on correlated characters |url=http://jstor.org/stable/2408842 |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |pages=1210<U+2013>26|doi=10.2307/2408842 |issue=6}}</ref> Natural selection occurs because only a few individuals in each generation will survive, since resources are limited and organisms produce many more offspring than their environment can support.

==History of evolutionary thought==
{{details|History of evolutionary thought}}
[[File:Charles Darwin aged 51 crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Around 1854 [[Charles Darwin]] began writing out what became ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.]]

The roots of scientific thinking can be dated to at least the 6th century BCE, with the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Anaximander]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wright, S|year=1984|title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations, Volume 1: Genetic and Biometric Foundations|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-91038-5}}</ref> However, the growth of modern biology out of [[natural history]] is fairly recent. As biological knowledge grew in the 18th century, proto-evolutionary ideas were set out by a few natural philosophers such as [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre Maupertuis]] in 1745 and [[Erasmus Darwin]] in 1796.<ref>{{cite book|author=Terrall, M|year=2002|title=The Man who flattened the Earth: Maupertuis and the sciences in the Enlightenment|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226793610}}</ref> The ideas of the biologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] about [[transmutation of species]] influenced radicals, but were rejected by mainstream scientists. [[Charles Darwin]] formulated his idea of [[natural selection]] in 1838 and was still developing his theory in 1858 when [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] sent him a similar theory, and both were presented to the [[Linnean Society of London]] in [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|separate papers]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wallace, A|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F350&viewtype=text&pageseq=1|title=On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties, and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London.

Debate about the mechanisms of evolution continued, and Darwin could not explain the source of the heritable variations which would be acted on by natural selection. Like Lamarck, he thought that parents [[inheritance of acquired characters|passed on adaptations acquired]] during their lifetimes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=136 |title=Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by Natural Selection |accessdate=2007-12-28 |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1872 |work=[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]. 6th edition, p. 108 |publisher=John Murray }}</ref> a theory which was subsequently dubbed [[Lamarckism]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Leakey, Richard E.; Darwin, Charles |title=The illustrated origin of species |publisher=Faber |location=London |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-571-14586-8 |oclc= |doi=}} p. 17-18 <!--superseded source {{cite journal |author=Stafleu F |title=Lamarck: The birth of biology |url=http://jstor.org/stable/1218244 |journal=Taxon |volume=20 |issue= 4|pages=397<U+2013>442 |year=1971 |pmid=11636092 |doi=10.2307/1218244}}--></ref> In the 1880s, [[August Weismann|August Weismann's]] experiments indicated that changes from use and disuse were not heritable, and Lamarckism gradually fell from favour.<ref name= ImaginaryLamarck>{{Cite book |last =Ghiselin | first = Michael T.|authorlink=Michael Ghiselin | publication-date = September/October 1994| contribution =Nonsense in schoolbooks: 'The Imaginary Lamarck' | contribution-url =http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm| title =The Textbook Letter | publisher =The Textbook League | url =http://www.textbookleague.org/|accessdate=2008-01-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Magner |first = Lois N. |title = A History of the Life Sciences |edition = Third |publisher = [[Marcel Dekker]], [[CRC Press]] |year = 2002 |isbn = 9780203911006 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q}}</ref> More significantly, Darwin could not account for how traits were passed down from generation to generation.

Yet it was the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on the fundamentals of genetics (of which Darwin and Wallace were unaware) by [[Hugo de Vries]] and others in the early 1900s that provided the impetus for a better understanding of how variation occurs in plant and animal traits. That variation is the main fuel used by natural selection to shape the wide variety of adaptive traits observed in organic life. Even though [[Hugo de Vries]] and other early geneticists rejected gradual natural selection, their rediscovery of and subsequent work on genetics eventually provided a solid basis on which the theory of evolution stood even more convincingly than when it was originally proposed.<ref>Quammen, D.

Norton & Company.</ref>

The apparent contradiction between Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and Mendel's work was reconciled in the 1920s and 1930s by evolutionary biologists such as [[J.B.S. Haldane]], [[Sewall Wright]], and particularly [[Ronald Fisher]], who set the foundations for the establishment of the field of [[population genetics]]. The end result was a combination of evolution by natural selection and Mendelian inheritance, the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bowler | first = Peter J. | authorlink = Peter J.

In its early history, evolutionary biology primarily drew in scientists from traditional taxonomically oriented disciplines, whose specialist training in particular organisms addressed general questions in evolution. As evolutionary biology expanded as an academic discipline, particularly after the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis, it began to draw more widely from the biological sciences.<ref name=Kutschera/> Currently the study of evolutionary biology involves scientists from fields as diverse as [[biochemistry]], ecology, genetics and [[physiology]], and evolutionary concepts are used in even more distant disciplines such as [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[philosophy]] and [[computer science]]. In the 21st century, [[current research in evolutionary biology]] deals with several areas where the modern evolutionary synthesis may need modification or extension, such as assessing the relative importance of various ideas on the [[unit of selection]] and [[evolvability]] and how to fully incorporate the findings of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pigliucci M |title=Do we need an extended evolutionary synthesis? |journal=Evolution |volume=61 |issue=12 |pages=2743<U+2013>9 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17924956 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Winther RG |title=Systemic darwinism |journal=Proc.

==Heredity==
{{See|Introduction to genetics|Genetics|Heredity}}
[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|right|200px|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the center, surrounded by phosphate<U+2013>sugar chains in a [[double helix]].]]
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable [[trait (biology)|traits]]&nbsp;<U+2013> particular characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[eye color]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327<U+2013>32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010}}</ref> Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].<ref name=Pearson_2006>{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398<U+2013>401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a}}</ref>

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behavior of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era<U+2014>concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255<U+2013>66 |year=2008 |month=April |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322}}</ref> As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330<U+2013>5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9}}</ref>

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.<ref name=Pearson_2006/> DNA is a long [[polymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence.

Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called [[gene]]s; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis<U+2014>the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

Another unsolved question in genetics is whether or not [[epigenetics]] is important in evolution. Epigenetics is when a trait is inherited without there being any change in gene sequences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Richards EJ |title=Inherited epigenetic variation<U+2014>revisiting soft inheritance |journal=Nat.

==Variation==
{{See|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's [[phenotype]] results from both its [[genotype]] and the influence from the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] it has lived in. A substantial part of the variation in phenotypes in a population is caused by the differences between their genotypes.<ref name=Lin/> The [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will fluctuate, becoming more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Evolutionary [[force]]s act by driving these changes in allele frequency in one direction or another. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]&nbsp;<U+2014> when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.<ref name=Amos>{{cite journal |author=Harwood AJ |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=Philos.

Variation comes from [[mutation]]s in [[genetic material]], migration between populations ([[gene flow]]), and the reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]]. Variation also comes from exchanges of genes between different species; for example, through [[horizontal gene transfer]] in [[bacteria]], and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] in plants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Draghi J, Turner P |title=DNA secretion and gene-level selection in bacteria |journal=Microbiology (Reading, Engl.) |volume=152 |issue=Pt 9 |pages=2683<U+2013>8 |year=2006 |pmid=16946263 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.29013-0}}<br />*{{cite journal |author=Mallet J |title=Hybrid speciation |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=279<U+2013>83 |year=2007 |pmid=17361174 |doi=10.1038/nature05706}}</ref> Despite the constant introduction of variation through these processes, most of the [[genome]] of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Butlin RK, Tregenza T |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philos.

===Sex and recombination===
{{See|Genetic recombination|Sexual reproduction}}
In asexual organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, the offspring of [[sex]]ual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through [[independent assortment]]. In a related process called [[homologous recombination]], sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Radding C |title=Homologous pairing and strand exchange in genetic recombination |journal=Annu.

Recombination allows even alleles that are close together in a strand of DNA to be [[Mendelian inheritance#First law|inherited independently]]. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other, and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lien S, Szyda J, Schechinger B, Rappold G, Arnheim N |title=Evidence for heterogeneity in recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region: high resolution analysis by sperm typing and radiation-hybrid mapping |journal=Am.

A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called [[genetic hitchhiking]].<ref>{{Cite journal

From a genetic viewpoint, evolution is a ''generation-to-generation change in the frequencies of alleles within a population that shares a common gene pool''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stoltzfus A |title=Mutationism and the dual causation of evolutionary change |journal=Evol. Dev. |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=304<U+2013>17 |year=2006 |pmid=16686641 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2006.00101.x}}</ref> A [[population]] is a localized group of individuals belonging to the same species. For example, all of the moths of the same species living in an isolated forest represent a population. A single gene in this population may have several alternate forms, which account for variations between the phenotypes of the organisms. An example might be a gene for coloration in moths that has two alleles: black and white. A [[gene pool]] is the complete set of alleles for a gene in a single population; the [[allele frequency]] measures the fraction of the gene pool composed of a single allele (for example, what fraction of moth coloration genes are the black allele). Evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms; for example, the allele for black color in a population of moths becoming more common.

To understand the mechanisms that cause a population to evolve, it is useful to consider what conditions are required for a population not to evolve. The ''[[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]'' states that the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if the only forces acting on that population are the random reshuffling of alleles during the formation of the sperm or egg, and the random combination of the alleles in these sex cells during [[Fertilisation|fertilization]].<ref name=oneil>{{cite web |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/synthetic/synth_2.htm|title= Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Model|accessdate=2008-01-06 |last= O'Neil |first=Dennis |year=2008 |work= The synthetic theory of evolution: An introduction to modern evolutionary concepts and theories|publisher=Behavioral Sciences Department, Palomar College }}</ref> Such a population is said to be in ''Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium''; it is not evolving.<ref name= Teach2>{{cite web |url=http://evoled.dbs.umt.edu/lessons/causes.htm#hardy|title= Causes of evolution|accessdate=2007-12-30 |last= Bright |first=Kerry |year=2006 |work= Teach Evolution and Make It Relevant |publisher=National Science Foundation}}</ref>

Gene transfer between species includes the formation of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] organisms and [[horizontal gene transfer]].

Migration into or out of a population can change allele frequencies, as well as introducing genetic variation into a population. Immigration may add new genetic material to the established [[gene pool]] of a population. Conversely, emigration may remove genetic material. As [[reproductive isolation|barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging populations are required for the populations to [[speciation|become new species]], gene flow may slow this process by spreading genetic differences between the populations. Gene flow is hindered by mountain ranges, oceans and deserts or even man-made structures such as the [[Great Wall of China]], which has hindered the flow of plant genes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Su H, Qu L, He K, Zhang Z, Wang J, Chen Z, Gu H |title=The Great Wall of China: a physical barrier to gene flow? |journal=Heredity |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=212<U+2013>9 |year=2003 |pmid=12634804 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800237}}</ref>

==Mechanisms==
The two main mechanisms that produce evolution are [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]]. Natural selection is the process which favors genes that aid survival and reproduction. Genetic drift is the random change in the frequency of alleles, caused by the random sampling of a generation's genes during reproduction. The relative importance of natural selection and genetic drift in a population varies depending on the strength of the selection and the [[effective population size]], which is the number of individuals capable of breeding.<ref name=Whitlock>{{cite journal |author=Whitlock M |title=Fixation probability and time in subdivided populations |journal=Genetics |volume=164 |issue=2 |pages=767<U+2013>79 |date=1 June 2003|pmid=12807795 |pmc=1462574 }}</ref> Natural selection usually predominates in large populations, whereas genetic drift dominates in small populations.

===Natural selection===
{{See|Natural selection|Fitness (biology)}}
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]

[[Natural selection]] is the process by which genetic mutations that enhance reproduction become, and remain, more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:
* Heritable variation exists within populations of organisms.
* Organisms produce more offspring than can survive.
* These offspring vary in their ability to survive and reproduce.

These conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors pass these advantageous traits on, while traits that do not confer an advantage are not passed on to the next generation.<ref name=Hurst>{{cite journal |author=Hurst LD |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |journal=Nat.

The central concept of natural selection is the [[fitness (biology)|evolutionary fitness]] of an organism.<ref name=Orr>{{cite journal |author=Orr HA |title=Fitness and its role in evolutionary genetics |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=531<U+2013>9 |year=2009 |month=August |pmid=19546856 |doi=10.1038/nrg2603 |pmc=2753274}}</ref> Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation.<ref name=Orr/> However, fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes.<ref name=Haldane>{{cite journal |author=Haldane J |title=The theory of natural selection today |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4663 |pages=710<U+2013>3 |year=1959 |pmid=13644170 | doi=10.1038/183710a0}}</ref> For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.<ref name=Orr/>

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''". Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival, and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer&nbsp;<U+2014> they are "selected ''against''".<ref name=Lande/> Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.<ref name="Futuyma"/> However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law]]).<ref>{{Cite journal

]]

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorized into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time&nbsp;<U+2014> for example organisms slowly getting taller.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hoekstra H, Hoekstra J, Berrigan D, Vignieri S, Hoang A, Hill C, Beerli P, Kingsolver J |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilizing selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.<ref name=Hurst/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Felsenstein |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773<U+2013>95 |date=1 November 1979|pmid=17248980 |pmc=1214112 }}</ref> This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.

A special case of natural selection is [[sexual selection]], which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andersson M, Simmons L |title=Sexual selection and mate choice |journal=Trends Ecol.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals, and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive.  "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[abiotic|physical]] as well as [[biotic component|biological]], in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (ie: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system."<ref name="Odum1971">Odum, EP (1971) Fundamentals of ecology, third edition, Saunders New York</ref>  Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system.  These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]], and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

An active area of research is the [[unit of selection]], with natural selection being proposed to work at the level of genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.<ref name=Gould>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal=Philos.

===Genetic drift===
{{See|Genetic drift|Effective population size}}
[[File:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|right|250px| Simulation of [[genetic drift]] of 20 unlinked alleles in populations of 10 (top) and 100 (bottom). Drift to [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixation]] is more rapid in the smaller population.]]
Genetic drift is the change in [[allele frequency]] from one generation to the next that occurs because alleles in offspring are a [[sampling (statistics)|random sample]] of those in the parents, as well as from the role that chance plays in determining whether a given individual will survive and reproduce. In mathematical terms, alleles are subject to [[sampling error]]. As a result, when selective forces are absent or relatively weak, allele frequencies tend to "drift" upward or downward randomly (in a [[random walk]]). This drift halts when an allele eventually becomes [[Fixation (population genetics)|fixed]], either by disappearing from the population, or replacing the other alleles entirely. Genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone. Even in the absence of selective forces, genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lande R |title=Fisherian and Wrightian theories of speciation |journal=Genome |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=221<U+2013>7 |year=1989 |pmid=2687093}}</ref>

The time for an allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Otto S, Whitlock M |title=The probability of fixation in populations of changing size |journal=Genetics |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=723<U+2013>33 |date=1 June 1997|pmid=9178020 |pmc=1208011 }}</ref> The precise measure of population that is important is called the [[effective population size]]. The effective population is always smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the number of animals that are too old or young to breed, and the lower probability of animals that live far apart managing to mate with each other.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Charlesworth B |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: Effective population size and patterns of molecular evolution and variation |journal=Nat.

==Outcomes==
Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behavior of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioral and physical [[adaptation]]s that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|co-operating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

These outcomes of evolution are sometimes divided into [[macroevolution]], which is evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, such as [[extinction]] and [[speciation]], and [[microevolution]], which is smaller evolutionary changes, such as adaptations, within a species or population.<ref name=ScottEC>{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

===Adaptation===
{{details|Adaptation}}

Adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology,<ref>Williams, George C. 1966. ''Adaptation and natural selection: a critique of some current evolutionary thought''. Princeton. "Evolutionary adaptation is a phenomenon of pervasive importance in biology." p5</ref> and is the ''process'' whereby an organism becomes better suited to its [[habitat]].<ref>Mayr, Ernst 1982. ''The growth of biological thought''. Harvard. p483: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process."</ref><ref>The ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of an organism that makes it better suited to its environment".</ref> Also, the term adaptation may refer to a [[Trait (biology)|trait]] that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of horses' teeth to the grinding of grass, or the ability of horses to run fast and escape predators. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process, and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by [[natural selection]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Orr H |title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=119<U+2013>27 |year=2005 |pmid=15716908 |doi=10.1038/nrg1523 }}</ref> The following definitions are due to [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]].
:1. ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its [[habitat]] or habitats.<ref>Dobzhansky T. 1968. On some fundamental concepts of evolutionary biology. ''Evolutionary biology'' '''2''', 1<U+2013>34.</ref>
:2. ''Adaptedness'' is the state of being adapted: the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats.<ref>Dobzhansky T. 1970. ''Genetics of the evolutionary process''. Columbia, N.Y. p4<U+2013>6, 79<U+2013>82, 84<U+2013>87</ref>
:3. An ''adaptive trait'' is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.<ref>Dobzhansky T. 1956. Genetics of natural populations XXV. Genetic changes in populations of ''Drosophila pseudoobscura'' and ''Drosphila persimilis'' in some locations in California. ''Evolution'' '''10''', 82<U+2013>92.</ref>

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to [[antibiotic]] selection, with genetic changes causing [[antibiotic resistance]] by both modifying the target of the drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nakajima A, Sugimoto Y, Yoneyama H, Nakae T |title=High-level fluoroquinolone resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to interplay of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump and the DNA gyrase mutation |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mandi/46/6/46_391/_article/-char/en |journal=Microbiol.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organization may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single [[homology (biology)|ancestral structure]] being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within [[bat]] wings, for example, are very similar to those in [[mouse|mice]] feet and [[primate]] hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.<ref>{{Cite journal

Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and co-operation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a [[Predation|predator]] and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species.

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in [[Eusociality|social insects]], such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the [[somatic cell]]s that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's [[germ cell]]s to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].<ref name=Bertram/>

Such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of [[kin selection]], which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Reeve HK, H<U+00F6>lldobler B |title=The emergence of a superorganism through intergroup competition |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0703466104 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume=104 |issue=23 |pages=9736<U+2013>40 |year=2007 |pmid=17517608 |pmc=1887545}}</ref> This activity is selected for because if the ''helping'' individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will ''also'' contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Axelrod R, Hamilton W |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=Science |volume=211 |issue=4489 |pages=1390<U+2013>6 | year = 2005 |pmid=7466396 |doi=10.1126/science.7466396 }}</ref> Other processes that may promote cooperation include [[group selection]], where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wilson EO, H<U+00F6>lldobler B |title=Eusociality: origin and consequences |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0505858102 |journal=Proc.

===Speciation===
{{See|Speciation}}
[[File:Speciation modes edit.svg|left|thumb|350px|The four mechanisms of speciation.]]
[[Speciation]] is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.<ref name=Gavrilets>{{cite journal |author=Gavrilets S |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197<U+2013>215 |year=2003 |pmid=14628909 |doi=10.1554/02-727}}</ref>  Evolutionary biologists view species as statistical phenomena and not categories or types. This view is counterintuitive since the classical idea of species is still widely held, with a species seen as a class of organisms exemplified by a "[[Biological type|type specimen]]" that bears all the traits common to this species. Instead, a species is now defined as a separately evolving lineage that forms a single [[gene pool]]. Although properties such as genetics and morphology are used to help separate closely related lineages, this definition has fuzzy boundaries.<ref>{{cite journal |author=De Queiroz K |title=Species concepts and species delimitation |journal=Syst.

There are four mechanisms for speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |year=2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=12 |pages=4792<U+2013>5 |pmid=18344323 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711998105 | author= Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B.; Backeljau, T.; Breugelmans, K.; Grbac, I.; Van Damme, R.; Irschick, D.J. |pmc=2290806}}</ref><ref name=Losos1997>{{cite journal |year=1997 |title=Adaptive differentiation following experimental island colonization in Anolis lizards| journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6628 |pages=70<U+2013>3 |doi=10.1038/387070a0 |author=Losos, J.B.

Schoener, T.W.}}</ref> As selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species, separation may eventually produce organisms that cannot interbreed.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hoskin CJ, Higgle M, McDonald KR, Moritz C |year=2005 |title=Reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation |journal=Nature|pmid=16251964 |volume=437|issue=7063 |pages =1353<U+2013>356|doi=10.1038/nature04004}}</ref>

The second mechanism of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation through both rapid genetic drift and selection on a small gene pool.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Templeton AR |title=The theory of speciation via the founder principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/94/4/1011 |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011<U+2013>38 |date=1 April 1980|pmid=6777243 |pmc=1214177}}</ref>

The third mechanism of speciation is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.<ref name=Gavrilets/> Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localized metal pollution from mines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Antonovics J |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |journal=Heredity |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33<U+2013>7 |year=2006 |pmid=16639420 |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 }}</ref> Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause ''reinforcement'', which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nosil P, Crespi B, Gries R, Gries G |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309<U+2013>27 |year=2007 |pmid=16900317 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 }}</ref>
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|frame|right|[[Geographical isolation]] of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] on the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] produced over a dozen new species.]]

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of [[gene flow]] may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Savolainen V, Anstett M-C, Lexer C, Hutton I, Clarkson JJ, Norup MV, Powell MP, Springate D, Salamin N, Baker WJr |year=2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |volume=441 |pages=210<U+2013>3 | pmid=16467788 |doi=10.1038/nature04566|issue=7090}}<br />*{{cite journal| author=Barluenga M, St<U+00F6>lting KN, Salzburger W, Muschick M, Meyer A |year=2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish |journal=Nature |volume=439 |pages=719<U+2013>23 |pmid=16467837 |doi=10.1038/nature04325| issue=7077}}</ref> Generally, sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic differences]] and [[assortative mating|non-random mating]], to allow reproductive isolation to evolve.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gavrilets S |title=The Maynard Smith model of sympatric speciation |journal=J.

One type of sympatric speciation involves cross-breeding of two related species to produce a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form [[polyploidy|polyploids]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wood TE, Takebayashi N, Barker MS, Mayrose I, Greenspoon PB, Rieseberg LH |title=The frequency of polyploid speciation in vascular plants |journal=Proc.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.<ref name=pe1972>Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould, 1972.

San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82<U+2013>115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge ''Time frames''. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press. 1985</ref> In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations. As a result, the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population, and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats, and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gould SJ |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |doi= 10.1073/pnas.91.15.6764 |journal=Proc.

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century. The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced about a generation later and legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of [[creationism]] was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in the form of [[intelligent design]], to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.

It was later expanded by others into ideas about "[[survival of the fittest]]" in commerce and human societies as a whole, and led to claims that [[social inequality]], [[sexism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]] were justified.<ref>On the history of [[eugenics]] and evolution, see {{cite book|authorlink=Daniel Kevles |first=D |last=Kevles |year=1998 |title=In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity |publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674445574}}</ref> However, these ideas contradict [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s own views, and contemporary scientists and philosophers consider these ideas to be neither mandated by evolutionary theory nor supported by data.<ref>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] strongly disagreed with attempts by Herbert Spencer and others to extrapolate evolutionary ideas to all possible subjects; see {{cite book|authorlink=Mary Midgley|first=M|last=Midgley|year=2004|title=The Myths we Live By|publisher=Routledge|page=62|isbn=978-0415340779}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Allhoff F |title=Evolutionary ethics from Darwin to Moore |journal=History and philosophy of the life sciences |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=51<U+2013>79 |year=2003 |pmid=15293515 |doi=10.1080/03919710312331272945}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Gowaty, Patricia Adair |title=Feminism and evolutionary biology: boundaries, intersections, and frontiers |publisher=Chapman & Hall |location=London |year=1997 |isbn=0-412-07361-7}}</ref>
