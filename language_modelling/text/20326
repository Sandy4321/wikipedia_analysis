==Business==
Her "Suzy's Zoo" greeting card company was launched in 1968, while she was still an undergraduate at [[San Diego State University]] working toward her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=D3jZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22suzy+spafford%22&dq=%22suzy+spafford%22&hl=en&ei=ah59TOGPD4OB8gb606zqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgo Dollinger, Marc J., ''Entrepreneurship: strategies and resources'', Marsh Publications, 2007, page 483]</ref> In 1999 she added a line of products for babies and toddlers, called Little Suzy's Zoo.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-136172423.html Children Today, May 1, 2005, cited at highbeam.com]</ref>

Her often humorous drawings feature more than 200 animal characters such as rabbits, turtles, snails and ostriches. The animals are drawn in bright colors, wearing clothes, shoes, and happy expressions. Her first fully developed animal character was a cross between a chicken and a duck, a cheerful extrovert known as Suzy Ducken. Each character has a personality and backstory; they all live in a fictional town called Duckport.  At first she drew all of the characters herself, but she quickly needed to hire assistants to keep up with the growing business. As of 2002 the Suzy's Zoo retail business had 50 employees and generated $50 million in annual revenue.<ref name = "SDSU">[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:o8wwWn5cCZEJ:advancement.sdsu.edu/marcomm/360/images/360win04.pdf+%22suzy+spafford%22&cd=20&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us The Magazine of San Diego State University, Spring 2001, page 8]</ref>

==Personal life==  

She grew up in [[San Diego, California]] and still lives there with her husband Roy Lidstrom, president of her company, Suzy's Zoo Studios.<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/biogs/spafford.asp Reuben award citation]</ref> She graduated from [[Point Loma High School]] and [[San Diego State University]].<ref name = "jrank">[http://biography.jrank.org/pages/1636/Spafford-Suzy-1945.html biography.jrank.org]</ref> She is a member of [[Kappa Delta]] Sorority.

She has been drawing since she was 3 years old.<ref name = "9-8-93">[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego-sub/access/1241842721.html?FMT=FT&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Sep+8%2C+1993&author=Don+Freeman&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&edition=&startpage=E.2&desc=The+fates+hold+string+we+spin+for+ourselves San Diego Union Tribune, September 8, 1993]</ref> She was especially inspired by the fanciful drawing of [[Ted Geisel]], "Dr. Seuss," whom she describes as "one of my heroes."<ref name = "9-8-93"/> Her parents supported her talent by enrolling her in painting classes and later private lessons in watercolor painting. By the time she was in college she was selling watercolor landscapes at art fairs. During slow times at the fairs she drew little cartoons of animals doing things like playing golf or fishing. Customers snapped up the animal drawings, so that her work became more and more focused on the style that became Suzy's Zoo.<ref name = "SDSU" />

She is a founding member of the San Diego Watercolor Society.<ref>[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2283271/2002-junior-achievement-honorees-Advertising.html San Diego Business Journal, November 11, 2002, cited at goliath.ecnext.com]</ref> She sits on the boards of directors of numerous charities including the Sharp Memorial Healthcare Foundation,<ref name = "8-8-99"/> the Rees-Stealy Research Foundation, the San Diego Hall of Champions, and San Diego Rotary.<ref name = "SDSU" />
