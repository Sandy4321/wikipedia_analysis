'''Morya Gosavi''' or '''Moraya Gosavi''' ({{lang-mr|<U+092E><U+094B><U+0930><U+092F><U+093E> <U+0917><U+094B><U+0938><U+093E><U+0935><U+0940>}}, {{IAST|Moray<U+0101> Gos<U+0101>vi}}) alias '''Moroba Gosavi''' was a prominent saint of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Ganapatya]] sect, which considers the elephant-faced god [[Ganesha]] as the Supreme Being. Morya Gosavi is considered the chief spiritual progenitor of the Ganapatyas and has been described as the "most famous devotee" of Ganesha.<ref name = "eor">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/gapatyas-eorl-05/|title=G<U+0101><U+1E47>apatyas|date=2001-6|work=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, an imprint of the Gale Group|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

The lifetime of Morya Gosavi is speculated between the 13th to 17th century. Numerous legends recall his life. Morya became devoted to Ganesha when he started visiting the [[Morgaon]] temple of Ganesha. It is believed that due to the hindrance in Morya's services to the god in the popular Ganesha shrine, Ganesha told Morya that he would appear in [[Chinchwad]] for Morya to worship, so Morya moved from Morgaon to Chinchwad, where Morya built a Ganesha temple. Consequently, Morya took ''[[Samadhi#As_leaving_the_body|sanjeevan samadhi]]'' by burying himself alive in his tomb. 

Morya had a son called Chintamani, venerated as a living incarnation of Ganesha and addressed as ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Dev]]''[[Deva (Hinduism)| ]](god). Chintamani was succeeded by six more ''Dev''s.  The tomb of Morya Gosavi and the Ganesha temple at Chinchwad still attract many Ganesha devotees.

==Early life==
According to one version of the story, Morya was born in [[Bidar]], [[Karnataka]]. He was thrown out of the house by his father as he was thought to be of no use to the family. Morya travelled to the Ganesha shrine at [[Morgaon]] - in neighbouring [[Maharashtra]] - where he found a liking to Ganesha. He settled at [[Chinchwad]], {{convert|50|mi|km}} away from Morgaon.<ref name="chichvad">{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Poona-III/places_c.html#.|title=Poona District: Places - CHINCHVAD|year=2006|publisher=The Gazetteers Department, Government of Maharashtra|accessdate=5 January 2010|origyear = 1885|archiveurl = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110614011820/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Poona-III/places_c.html#|archivedate = 14 June 2011}}</ref>
Another story declares him to be a son of a poor but pious couple from [[Pune]], Maharashtra. Morya is believed to have been born due to the grace of Ganesha, whom the childless couple propitiated. After the birth of Morya, the family moved to Pimple, {{convert|40|mi|km}} away from Chinchwad. After the death of his parents, Morya moved to [[Tathavade]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} away from Chichwad.<ref name = "chichvad"/> Both legends declare he visited the Morgaon temple regularly, daily or monthly to worship Ganesha.<ref name = "chichvad"/>

Another tale tells that Morya's parents, Bhat Shaligram and his wife moved to Morgaon from Bidar. His parents prayed to Ganesha at Morgaon. Soon, Morya was born to them. Later, Morya became seriously ill and was not recovering so they prayed to Ganesha again. Soon, a ''Gosavi'' (priest) named Nayan Bharati came and gave medicine to Morya, curing him. Nayan Bharati also preached to Morya. Henceforth, the Bhat family took the family name Gosavi and Morya was known as Morya Gosavi.<ref name="municipal"/><ref name="dhere">{{cite web|url=http://rcdhere.com/Prachin_Marathichya_Navdhara/Prachin_Marathichya_Navdhara_3.html|title=Summary of ''Prachin Marathichya Navdhara'' (Marathi book) chapter 2: Marathi literature of Ganesha cult|last=Dhere|first=R C|work= Official site of R C Dhere|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref>

==From Morgaon to Chinchwad==
[[File:Morgaon.jpg|thumb|The Morgaon temple of Ganesha where Morya Gosavi worshipped Ganesha, before shifting to Chinchwad]]

According to a legend, on the occasion of [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] (August<U+2013>September) - the largest festival dedicated to Ganesha - Morya could not find a place in the temple, crowded by the laity and the wealthy Pingle family. Morya left his offering under a tree and then by a "miracle", the laity's offerings from temple were exchanged with Morya's offerings under the tree. The laity accused Morya of sorcery and prohibited his entry in Morgaon. Ganesha appeared in a dream of Pingle and told Pingle that he was offended by the ill-treatment of his favourite devotee Morya. So Pingle requested Morya to come back to Morgaon, but Morya refused. Ganesha thus gave a vision to Morya saying that he would come to stay with Morya in Chinchwad. Accordingly, Morya found an image of Ganesha - similar to the one worshipped at Morgaon - while bathing in the river and built a small shrine for it.<ref name = "chichvad"/>

Another tale tells that the head-man of Morgaon was impressed by Morya's pious ways and offered him milk everyday he visited Morgaon. Once the head-man was not present at his house, so a blind girl went to offer the milk to Morya. The moment she touched the threshold of the house where Morya was waiting, her sight was restored. Morya became famous due to this miracle and is credited to have cured the eyes of Shivaji (1627<U+2013>1680) too - who would become the founder of the [[Maratha Empire]] later. To escape the crowds of people, Morya relocated to the forest, where present-day  Chinchwad stands. Due to his growing age, Morya found it hard to continue his visits to Morgaon. Once he reached Morgaon after the temple was closed. Tired and hugry, he slept. Ganesha gave Morya a dream-vision telling Morya to offer his prayers to him and that he would reside with Morya in Chinchwad and incarnate in Morya's lineage for seven generations. Morya woke to find the temple doors miraculously opened and offered his prayers. In morning when the temple-priests opened the temple-doors, they were astonished to see fresh flowers offered to the Lord and a pearl necklace missing. The necklace was discovered on Morya's neck, who was imprisoned but then freed due to Ganesha's aid. Morya found a conical stone rising in Chinchwad home, which he recognized as Ganesha and built a temple for it.<ref name = "chichvad"/>

Another legend does not talk about his arrest, but says that Morya realised the presence of Ganesha at Morgaon but realised that there was hindrance in his devotion, so he moved to the forest near Tathavade to worship Ganesha. On every fourth lunar day after the full moon, Morya used to visit the[[Chintamani Temple, Theur| Chintamani Temple of Theur]]. Once, devotees from Chinchwad requested Morya to visit the bank of [[Pavana River]] at Chinchwad. There, Chintamani - the form of Ganesha worshipped at Theur - is believed to have ordered Morya to marry. As per Ganesha's orders, Morya got married to Uma, the daughter of Govindrao Kulkarni whose family was staying in Tathavade near Chinchwad.<ref name="municipal"/> 

According to a story, as per his guru's orders, Morya performed penance at Theur by observing a strict fast for 42 days, within this period, he is believed to have "divine revelations".<ref name="dhere"/> After the death of his parents, Morya moved from Morgaon to Chinchwad.<ref name="dhere"/> The present structure of the Theur temple is built by Morya.<ref name="Grimes1995">{{cite book|author=John A.

==Death and lineage==
Morya continued to visit Theur, [[Ranjangaon]] (another Ganesha temple site) and Chinchwad. Morya had a son, whom he named Chintamani (Chintaman).<ref name="municipal"/> Chintamani was venerated as a living incarnation of Ganesha.<ref name = "chichvad"/> But before that according to some experts, he helped the deposed [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Humayun]] (1508<U+2013>1556)  to escape to [[Kabul]], when Humayun again became the Emperor of [[Delhi]], he showered Morya with gifts.<ref name="municipal"/> According to Dhere, Shivaji's father Shahaji (1594<U+2013>1665) is recorded as a donor to Morya Gosavi.<ref name="dhere"/>

After his wife's death and his guru Nayan Bharati's ''sanjeevan samadhi'', Morya also took ''sanjeevan samadhi'' by burying himself alive in a tomb with a holy book in his hand.<ref name="municipal"/><ref name="dhere"/><ref name = "chichvad"/> Morya left strict orders that his tomb be never opened.<ref name = "chichvad"/> Chintamani built a temple over his father's tomb.<ref name="dhere"/> Chintamani is described to have shown his true form as Ganesha to the [[Varkari]] saint-poet [[Tukaram]] (1577 - c.1650), who called Chintamani a ''Dev'' spelt also as Deva or Deo (god). The lineage was henceforth known as the Dev family.<ref name = "chichvad"/>

Chintamani was followed as a ''Dev'' by Narayan, Chintamani II, Dharmadhar, Chintamani III, Narayan II and Dharmadhar II. The Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (1658<U+2013>1707) gifted Narayan the hereditary grant of eight villages, impressed by the latter's "miracle" of changing a piece of beef sent by the former into jasmine flowers. (Beef is considered unholy in Hinduism and killing of cows - considered sacred - is prohibited.<ref name="Simoons1994">{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

According to the tale, Morya who was found still mediating in the tomb, was disturbed and cursed Narayan that his son would be the last Dev. Narayan's son, Dharmadhar II - the seventh generation of Morya - died childless in 1810 ending the direct lineage of Morya, but a distant relative of Dharmadhar, Sakhari was installed as a ''Dev'' by the priesthood to continue the temple funding.<ref name = "chichvad"/> Devotional poetry of all the Devs still survive.<ref name="dhere"/>

==Veneration==
Morya Gosavi is considered the chief spiritual progenitor and the most important saint of the Ganapatya - the Hindu sect centred on Ganesha worship - tradition and has been described as the "most famous devotee" of Ganesha.<ref name="eor">{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/gapatyas-eorl-05/|title=G<U+0101><U+1E47>apatyas|date=2001-6|work=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, an imprint of the Gale Group|accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

Chinchwad has shrines to the departed ''Dev''s, chief of which is that of Morya. Morya's memorial temple is a low plain building (30' x 20' x 40') with a square hall or [[mandap]]  and an octagonal inner shrine, inscribed with a [[Marathi language|Marathi]] inscription: "This temple was begun on the bright twelfth of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]] (November<U+2013>December) [[Shaka era|Shaka]] 1580 (A.D. 1658-9) Vilambi [[Samvatsara]] and finished on Monday the bright fourth of [[Ashadha]], Vikari Samvatsara".<ref name="chichvad" /> The temples enjoyed the revenue from the eight villages given by Aurangzeb in the past.<ref name = "chichvad"/> The tomb of Morya Gosavi as well as the Ganesha temple constructed by him still attracts many Ganesha devotees to Chinchwad.<ref name="municipal">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20120222231738/http://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/history.asp?MID=0&PID=0&MenuID=114&Title=History%20And%20Culture|archivedate=22 February 2012|url=http://www.pcmcindia.gov.in/history.asp?MID=0&PID=0&MenuID=114&Title=History%20And%20Culture|title=Culture and History  |year=2008|publisher= Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) |accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref name = "eor"/> Devotees believe that though Morya Gosavi attained [[moksha]] (salvation) but "his presence continues to endow the shrine with sacred significance."<ref name = "eor"/>

On the circumbulation path (''[[Parikrama (religious practice)|Pradakshina]]'' path) of the [[Morgaon Ganesha temple]], there is a tree near the Kalpavrushka Mandir.
