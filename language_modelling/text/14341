A '''Zemi''' or '''Cemi''' is a [[Ta<U+00ED>no]] concept, meaning both a deity, or ancestral spirit, and a sculptural object that houses the spirit.<ref name=b23>Bercht et al, 23</ref> They were also created by neighboring tribes in the [[Caribbean]] and northern [[South America]].<ref name=b24>Bercht et al, 24</ref>

==Theology==
Ta<U+00ED>no religion, as recorded by late 15th and 16th century Spaniards, centered on a supreme creator god and a fertility goddess. The creator god is [[Yukiyu|Y<U+00FA>cahu Ma<U+00F3>rocoti]] and he governs the growth of the staple food, the [[cassava]]. The goddess is Attabeira, who governs water, rivers, and seas. Lesser deities govern natural forces and are also zemis.<ref name=b23>Bercht et al, 23</ref> Boinayel, the Rain Giver, is one such zemi, whose magical tears become rainfall.<ref name=heil/>
Spirits of ancestors, also zemis, were highly honored, particularly those of [[cacique]]s or chiefs. Bones or skulls might be incorporated into sculptural zemis or [[reliquary]] urns. Ancestral remains would be housed in shrines and given offerings, such as food.<ref name=b23/> 

Zemis could be consulted by medicine people for advice and healing.<ref name=cuba>Corbett, Bob. [http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=11 Arawak/Taino Related Myths.] ''Cuba Heritage.'' (retrieved 19 Sept 2009)</ref> During these consultation ceremonies, images of the zemi could be painted or tattooed on the body of a priest, who was known as a ''Bohuti'' or ''Buhuithu''.<ref>Joyce, 195</ref> The reliquary zemis would help their own descendants in particular.<ref name=j193>Joyce, 193</ref>

==Religious art==
[[File:Tainocemi.svg|thumb|Drawing of a Ta<U+00ED>no three-point zemi]]
Sculptural zemis, or "[[amulet|amuletic]] zemis" take many forms,<ref name=j193/> but the most characteristically Ta<U+00ED>no art form is the three-point stone zemi. One side of the stone might have a human or animal head with the opposite side having hunched legs. These are sometimes known as "frog's legs" due to their positioning. The fierce face of the creator god is often portrayed. Very small ceramic three-point zemis have been uncovered by archaeologists in the [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]], dating back to 200 BCE.<ref name=b24/> Small amuletic zemis would be worn on warrior's foreheads for protection in battle.<ref name=j193>Joyce, 193</ref>

Zemis are sculpted from a wide variety of materials, including bone, clay, wood, shell, sandstone, and stone.<ref name=heil/> They are found in [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Puerto Rico]], and other Caribbean islands. Some are quite large, up to 100 cm tall. Some are effigies of birds, snakes, alligators and other animals,<ref name=cuba/> but most are human effigies. Even twin human figures are portrayed.<ref>Bercht, 8, 14, 18, 55, 92, and 123</ref>

Wooden zemis were preserved in relatively dry caves. It is believed that Ta<U+00ED>no people hid their ceremonial objects in caves, away from the Spanish, or destroyed them to avoid having them fall into Spanish hands.<ref name=b30>Bercht et al, 30</ref>

===Beaded zemis===
Two of the most elaborate surviving zemis are housed in European museums. One is a belt with a zemi from the [[Greater Antilles]]. The belt dates from circa 1530 and is made of cotton, white and red snail shells, black seeds, pearls, glass, and [[obsidian]]. It is housed in the [[Museum of Ethnology, Vienna|Museum f<U+00FC>r V<U+00F6>lkerkunde]] in [[Vienna]].<ref name="Berecht 159">Bercht et al, 159</ref>

The second is housed in the [[Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography]] in [[Rome]]. Until 1952, it was wrongly labeled as an African fetish, but scholars have confirmed that it is Ta<U+00ED>no from the early 16th century and exhibits elements of Caribbean, European, and African artistic influences.<ref name="Berecht 159" />
