'''Arvas''', formerly known as '''<U+00D6>rth''',  is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[black metal]] band formed in [[Bergen]] in 1993 as a one-man project by vocalist and guitarist [[Vassago Rex]] (V-Rex). In Summer 1996, [[Borknagar]] drummer [[Erik Br<U+00F8>dreskift|Grim]] and [[Gorgoroth]] bassist [[Ares (musician)|Ares]] joined the band. They recorded an album in Winter 1996, titled ''[[Nocturno Inferno]]'', but it was never released. After Grim committed [[suicide]] in 1999, Vassago Rex decided to keep on going as a one-man project, but changed the band's name. He recorded two demos, ''[[Countless Souls at Dawn]]'' and ''[[I Am Thy Grief]]'', and a [[split album]] with [[Hordagaard]] titled ''[[Dawn of Satan]]/[[Uncle Satan]]'', which was released by [[Azermedoth Records]]. The band's new album ''[[Blessed from Below <U+2013> Ad Sathanas Noctum]]'' will be released in 2010 by the same record label.
