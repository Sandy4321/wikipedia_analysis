'''Philatelic cover''' refers to the outside of an [[envelope]], typically with [[postage stamp]]s affixed, that have been [[Cancellation (mail)|cancelled]] (usually by sending through the mail delivery system) for the purpose of creating a collectible item.  Often the cover commemorates a special event, anniversary, or place.  The term ''philatelic cover'' is generally used among stamp and postal history collectors.

==Definition==
[[Philatelist]]s (stamp and [[postal history]] collectors) use the term '''cover''' pertaining to the outside of an addressed envelope or [[Mail|package]], typically with postage stamps affixed which have been cancelled <U+2013> usually with a special [[Postmark|mark]] <U+2013> and commemorating a special event or service. The term does not include the contents of the letter or package (although they may add interest to the item if still present). 

==Role in collecting==
Collecting covers plays an important role in postal history as many covers bear stamps, postmarks and other markings which help place a cover at a given time and place in history.<ref>[http://www.stampclubs.com/phs/index.htm Postal History Society]</ref><ref name="Covers">{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&tid=2027597  |publisher=Smithsonian [[National Postal Museum]] |title=Covers in Phalately |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="Collecting Stamps: Covers">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles01/article694.shtml |publisher=OldAndSold Philatelic  |title=Collecting Stamps: Covers |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Cover AAT 1959.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Australian Antarctic Territory|AAT]] cover commemorating the opening of a [[post office]] in 1959]]
The term originates from the practice of covering a letter by folding a separate sheet about it to physically protect it and prevent infringement of confidentiality. In the first half of the 19th century it became the fashion to cut the cover into a diamond or lozenge shape. This was the precursor of the version of the envelope known today. Its convenience and popularity led to the lozenge design being adopted for the special prepaid postage envelopes and covers issued in 1840 after postal reforms were introduced by [[Rowland Hill (postal reformer)|Rowland Hill]] and others.<ref name="Stamps">{{cite web |url=http://www.steinerag.com/flw/stamps.htm |publisher=The Wright Library |title=Stamps, History |accessdate=2010-12-10}}></ref>

[[Stamp collector]]s began to send mail to each other and to themselves early on; philatelic mail is known from the late 19th century onward.  While some collectors specialize in philatelic covers, especially [[first day cover]]s and [[cachet]]ed covers, others regard them as contrived objects that are not reflective of real-world usage, and often will pay a higher price for a cover that represents genuine commercial use. Often, a philatelic cover will have more historical significance than randomly mailed covers as philatelic covers are also often mailed from the actual location on the date of an important or noteworthy event, like an inauguration or a space launch.<ref>[http://stamps.about.com/od/historyofphilately/tp/Collecting-Philatelic-Covers.htm Collecting Different Types Of Philatelic Covers, John Finch]</ref>

===Historic philatelic covers===
Various types of covers, usually prepared by collectors, historians or other enthusiasts, have great historical significance and, regardless of the intention for the mailed item, are sometimes noteworthy or famous in their own right.

====Zeppelin mail====

{{main|Zeppelin mail}}
Among the most definitive examples of famous or popular philatelic covers is Zeppelin mail.  These are covers that were carried aboard zeppelins in the 1930s and bear special postmarks and other special markings. Because the new Zeppelins were the fastest way to get mail delivered across the Atlantic ocean they carried a great deal of mail. Because of all the fanfare surrounding the Zeppelins most of mail carried aboard were Zeppelin first flight covers. Much of the funding for the Zeppelin delivery system was generated by collectors and other enthusists of the period. Because of the fast mail delivery service there was a lot of  commercial mail aboard these vessels. Mail service across the Atlantic Ocean was reduced from weeks to a few days. Hindenburg<U+2019>s 2-1/2 day service was the fastest way to send mail between Europe and North America in 1936.<ref>[http://www.airships.net/zeppelin-mail Airships: The Hindenburg and other Zeppelins]</ref>

====First Flight mail====

With the advent of air travel it wasn't long before airplanes were carrying the mail between distant points about the globe. In the United States and Germany Air Mail delivery was greeted with the same national enthusiasm and fanfare as was experienced with the first trips to the moon by US Astronauts. Consequently many people sent philatelic mail to themselves or friends that was carried aboard these flights in order to get a souvenir of the historic event. Covers carried aboard these flights are very popular and famous in some cases. The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, and carried mail from Washington DC to New York City. The type of airplane used was the U.S Army Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" biplanes flown by Army pilots with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President [[Woodrow Wilson]], U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.<ref>Jones, A.D.

==Cover categories==
[[File:Officercolorado.jpg|thumb|right|Last day of service cover from the [[discontinued post office]] at Officer, Colorado]]
The possible kinds of philatelic covers are only limited by the imagination of creative collectors, but there are a number of well-known and basic categories for covers.<ref>Note: Names for cover types are also terminology usually used by collectors of stamps and postal history.</ref>  There exists a wide variety of covers that can fit into several basic categories. The categories begin with the most common types of collectible covers, such as first day covers or first flight covers. Sometimes there will be an area of overlap in the subject of categories. For example there are ''First day covers'' that were also sent with mail aboard airplanes on ''First flight'' mail runs. ''Event'' covers can also include, ''First flights'', or other types of covers. A military cover sent to a head of state can also be referred to as a ''Historic cover''.<ref name="Cover collecting 101">{{cite web |url=http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/covers_20070716/refreshercourse.aspx |author=David Dobson, author of 'Scottish Emigration to Colonial America, 1607-1785' |publisher=Linn's Stamp News |title=Cover collecting 101: basic terminology and definitions used by collectors |author=Rick Miller |accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="Scotts US Stamp Catalogue">Scotts US Stamp Catalogue</ref><ref name="stamps.net">[http://www.stamps.net/posthist.htm Stamps.Net]</ref>

* A [[first day cover]] is typically an envelope with a postage stamp canceled on its [[first day of issue]]. The design or theme of the stamp may be printed on the cover to enhance its appeal to the philatelic community.<ref name="A Short Course on First Day Covers">{{cite web |url=http://www.afdcs.org/fdccourse.html |publisher=American First Day Cover Society |title=A Short Course on First Day Covers |accessdate=2010-12-10 }}</ref>  Often, these are [[Cachet|cacheted]] covers <U+2013> sent on envelopes with additional artwork, usually relating to the theme of the stamp.
* An [[event cover]] celebrates an event or notes an [[anniversary]]. World Expositions often featured special postmarks <U+2013> where a temporary post office was set up and mail sent out from it on a given day of the Expo' (i.e.: first day, last day, etc.).
* Stamp on cover. This is a cover that is collected as an example of a given stamp postally used on a cover, however older stamps with recent cancellations are usually philatelic (mailed with the intention of recovering and collecting the item).
* A pre-stamped cover is a cover that already has an [[imprinted stamp]].
* First flight covers are those carried on an aircraft, usually authorized by a government or postal administration, for the first time on a particular route.
* [[Event cover|commemorative cover]]s can include a wide variety of subjects and usually have a commemorative design and often a special postmark (used temporarily by a post office) and designates the place and date of the specific event.
* Covers sent to collect particular [[postal marking]]s.
* A [[stampless cover]] is an envelope or folded outer sheet bearing an address and manuscript or ink-stamped postal markings without prepaid adhesive postage stamps, normally from the period before adhesive postage stamps became available or common in the mid-to-late 19th Century.<ref>[http://www.uspcs.org/uspcsStampless.html U.S. Philatelic Classics Society]</ref>
* [[Military mail|Military covers]] can include a wide variety of subjects that may include first flight and prisoner of war. Mail sent from a Army Post Office (APO) or a Navy Post Office (Fleet Post Office, FPO) are common types of military covers.<ref>[http://www.stamps.com/usps/military-mail/ USPS Military Mail APO FPO]; stamps.com; accessed .</ref>
* A [[Railway post office|Railroad cover]] is a piece of mail that was processed aboard special rail cars outfitted with an official post office where mail is processed en route to its general destination.
* Historical covers are those that have special historical significance above and beyond that of the average collectible cover. These can include mail sent by royalty, presidents or other heads of state. If the historical cover is i.e. to or from a General in an Army the cover then can also be classified as a military cover.<ref name="Cover collecting 101"/><ref name="Scotts US Stamp Catalogue"/> Names for cover categories are usually used as general reference in philately. If aspects of a cover (date+postmark, name+address) are referenced in a historical capacity the category of the cover may not even be mentioned.
* Last day of service of a [[discontinued post office]]
* [[Mixed franking]]s.

Other specialty types of covers include [[Postal censorship|''Censored covers'']]; ''Blockade mail''; ''[[Pony Express]]''; ''Prisoner of war'' covers; and Patriotic covers.

==Identifying philatelic covers==
[[Image:Cover US philatelic 1925.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A 1925 philatelic cover, produced by adding common foreign stamps to a usage of a United States 2-cent of the "Norse-American issue". The postal clerk should have rejected this cover, but instead the foreign stamps received US postmarks. From left to right, the stamps are from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]], [[French Guiana]], [[United States]], and [[French India]].]]
Philatelic covers are normally very easy to spot. Characteristics include:
*The cover is still sealed and appears to be empty.
*The stamps used are far above that needed for the postal service used.
*The cover is addressed to a well known dealer.
*The stamps include a full set of one particular issue, possibly applied in order of value.
*The stamps are applied very tidily and/or the postmark appears to have been very carefully applied so as not to obscure too much of the stamps.
*The cover bears a cachet or special design, usually on the left side portion of the envelope.
*The address consists of a small rubber stamp or adhesive label in the bottom right hand corner of the cover.
*The cover has a rarely seen combination of stamps, for instance with stamps that were issued many years apart.

While many philatelists prefer genuine commercial covers to philatelically-contrived covers, philatelic covers may still be acceptable in collections of countries and eras where few other covers exist. Whether the cover was contrived or not, it is still an item of mail sent through the same postal system as other covers from a given country, with a postage stamp(s) and postmark, and is often more historically significant than covers set with no intention of recovery.

==Availability==
The availability of the different types of covers varies considerably and is something that often adds perspective to the historical and philatelic significance of the cover. For example, ''First Day'' covers and ''First Flight'' covers are generally common because the events that inspired the creation of these covers were somewhat common. In other examples, various types of military and historical covers are often scarce or rare because the circumstances or events that prompted the creation of these covers were conversely uncommon. While covers sent in recent decades tend to be common, they can also prove to be scarce simply because the circumstance that created these covers were (sometimes very) uncommon, as are the various examples of historical covers i.e. sent by a head of state to another officially prominent individual. At the same time there exist covers that are quite old but are still common and not very difficult to find, as are various types of post cards or commercial covers. Patriot covers are generally common because the practice of sending these was popular, especially during periods of war. Patriotic cover availability here can vary also depending on the country and time period in question. Covers collected for the ''stamp on cover'' can vary greatly  in availability and generally depends on the availability of the stamp issue itself along with the demand for the use of a particular denomination. The denomination of a stamp often determines the availability of the issue on cover as the use of some, usually higher, denominations was uncommon because of the low demand for a particular postage rate.<ref name="Cover collecting 101"/><ref name="Scotts US Stamp Catalogue"/><ref name="stamps.net"/> There are a number of circumstances that can affect the availability of a given cover type and which often contribute to a cover's historical and philatelic value.<ref>[http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&tid=2027691 Patriotic Covers from Smithsonian National Postal Museum]</ref><ref>[http://www.rfrajola.com/jpmcd/65_46.htm Frajola, Patriotic Covers]</ref>
