'''Carole King''' (born [[February 9]], [[1942]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[pianist]]. She was most active as a singer during the first half of the [[1970s]], but she was a successful songwriter for considerably longer both before and after this period.

==Biography==
Born in [[1942]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], '''Carole Klein''' (as she was then known) started out playing the [[piano]] and then moved on to singing, forming a vocal quartet called the Co-Sines at [[Abraham Lincoln High School (New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]]. While attending [[Queens College, New York|Queens College]], King befriended [[Paul Simon]], [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Gerry Goffin]].

Goffin and King soon formed a songwriting partnership, eventually marrying.  Working in the famous [[Brill Building]], where chart-topping hits were churned out during the [[1960s]], the Goffin-King partnership first hit it big with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow".  Recorded by [[The Shirelles]], the song topped the charts in [[1961]]; it was later covered by [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Laura Branigan]], [[Little Eva]], and King herself. Further hits written by the pair include "Take Good Care of My Baby" ([[Bobby Vee]] and later [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], [[Bobby Vinton]], [[Stephen Collins]], and [[Smokie]]) "[[The Loco-Motion]]" ([[Little Eva]], and later [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]), "One Fine Day" ([[The Chiffons]] and later [[Aaron Neville]], [[Rita Coolidge]], and [[Natalie Merchant]]), "Pleasant Valley Sunday" ([[The Monkees]]), "Some Kind of Wonderful" ([[The Drifters]] version is not the same song as the Grand Funk Rairoad version), "Up on the Roof" ([[The Drifters]], [[Laura Nyro]], [[Billy Joe Royal]], [[James Taylor]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Peter Cincotti]], and later King herself), "Chains" (The Cookies, and later [[The Beatles]]), "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]" ([[Aretha Franklin]], and later [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Laura Nyro]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and King herself), "Don't Bring Me Down" ([[The Animals]]), "Wasn't Born to Follow" ([[The Byrds]]), "[[I'm Into Something Good]]" ([[Herman's Hermits]]), "Go Away Little Girl" ([[Steve Lawrence]]), and "[[He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)]]" ([[The Crystals]]). She had a modest hit singing one of her own songs in 1962 with "It Might As Well Rain Until September." The pair had two daughters, [[Louise Goffin]] and Sherry Goffin Kondor who also became singers. In 1965, Goffin and King wrote a spec theme to [[Sidney Sheldon]]'s new television series, ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', but the song was rejected in favor of an instrumental theme by [[Hugo Montenegro]]. "I Feel The Earth Move" later also charted for [[Martika]] in 1989.

After failing several times at launching a solo career, King eventually helped pioneer a record label, [[Tomorrow Records]], divorced Goffin and married [[Charles Larkey]] (of the [[Myddle Class]]). Moving to the West Coast, Larkey, King and [[Danny Kortchmar]] formed a group called [[The City (group)|The City]], which released one album, ''[[Now That Everything's Been Said]],'' but the album was a commercial failure. King then released ''[[Writer (album)|Writer]]'' ([[1970]]), another commercial failure. Undaunted, the following year King gave thoughtful, folk-flavored reinterpretations of some of her early pop hits as a songwriter, placing them on an album alongside new compositions. ''[[Tapestry (album)|Tapestry]]'' ([[1971]]) became a turning point in her career. 

Her best-received album, ''Tapestry'' was instantly recognized as one of the landmark albums of the [[singer-songwriter]] genre of the early [[1970s]]. With numerous hit singles, ''Tapestry'' would remain on the charts for nearly six years and sell over 1o million copies in the US alone, an estimated 22 million world-wide, remaining her most popular album among fans and critics alike. The album garnered four Grammy Awards including Album of the Year; Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female; Record of the Year ("It's Too Late"); and Song of the Year ("You've Got a Friend"). ''[[Music (Carole King album)|Music]]'' ([[1971]]), ''[[Rhymes and Reasons]]'' ([[1972]]) and ''[[Wrap Around Joy]]'' ([[1974]]) followed, each selling respectably. ''Tapestry'' was placed at #36 on the Rolling Stones top 500 which is the highest placement held by a woman. <ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]</ref>

In 1973, Carole King performed a free concert in New York City's Central Park and broke all previous records for such a concert with over 100,000 people attending. <ref>[http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=226& Carole King Artistfacts]</ref>

Goffin and King reunited to write ''[[Thoroughbred (Carole King album)|Thoroughbred ]]'' ([[1975]]) with [[David Crosby]], [[Graham Nash]] and [[James Taylor]], a long-time friend of King's. She married another songwriting partner, [[Rick Evers]], after releasing ''[[Simple Things (Carole King album)|Simple Things]]'' ([[1977]]); he died of a [[cocaine]] [[drug overdose|overdose]] one year later. Also in 1975, King scored a number of songs for the animated TV production of [[Maurice Sendak]]'s work, ''[[Really Rosie]]''.

After releasing a collection called ''[[Speeding Time]]'' in [[1983]], King took a hiatus in [[Idaho]], where she became an environmental activist. She returned to music in [[1989]], recording ''[[City Streets]]'', followed by ''[[Color of Your Dreams]]'' ([[1993]]), with a guest appearance by [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] of [[Guns N' Roses]]. In 1990, Carole King was inducted, along with Goffin, into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the non-performer category for her songwriting achievements.

King is very politically active in the [[United States Democratic Party]]. In 2003 she began campaigning for [[John Kerry]], performing in private homes for caucus delegates during the Democratic primaries. On [[July 29]], [[2004]], she made a short speech and sang at the Democratic National Convention, about two hours before Kerry made his acceptance speech for the Democratic nomination for President. King continued her support of Kerry throughout the general election.

King's "Where You Lead (I Will Follow)" is the theme song to ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', in the theme song version she sings with her daughter. King herself &mdash; who has appeared sporadically in acting roles &mdash; has guest starred three times on the show (in its second, fifth, and sixth seasons) as Sophie, the owner of the [[Stars Hollow]] music store.

King launched her "Living Room Tour" (in a nod to her appearances in private homes during the Democratic primaries) on [[July 15]], [[2004]] at the Auditorium Theatre (Chicago, Illinois).  That show, along with the shows at the Greek Theatre (Los Angeles, California), and the Cape Cod Melody Tent (Hyannis, Massachusetts) were recorded live and released as ''[[The Living Room Tour]]'' album on [[July 12]], [[2005]].  The 2005 leg of "The Living Room Tour" kicked off on [[July 3]], [[2005]] in Ontario, Canada.
