'''Hurricane Ella''' was a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane that threatened the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] during the busy [[Labor Day Weekend]]. It formed on August&nbsp;30 to the south of [[Bermuda]], and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. By September&nbsp;1, Ella reached winds of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h), and it was expected to pass close to the [[East Coast of the United States]]. For about 24&nbsp;hours, the hurricane became stationary, and it later turned to the northeast away from the coast. On September&nbsp;4, Ella attained Category&nbsp;4 [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]] at 38<U+00B0>[[Latitude|N]], further north than any other [[Atlantic hurricane]]. It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of [[Newfoundland]] before being absorbed by a large [[extratropical cyclone]].

In North Carolina, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a hurricane watch due to the large influx of people expected during the holiday weekend. As such, there was a significant drop in [[tourism]], and no significantly adverse weather occurred along the Outer Banks. High waves and some minor beach erosion was reported, but there were no deaths, injuries, or damage from Ella. By the time the hurricane passed Newfoundland, the strongest winds were to the southeast of the center, and as a result, no significant impact was reported on Canada.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Ella 1978 track.png|left}}
Toward the end of August 1978, a [[cold front]] stalled and dissipated across the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], which spawned a tropical disturbance southeast of [[Bermuda]] on August&nbsp;28. A circulation was present, and it [[tropical cyclogenesis|developed]] into a tropical depression on August&nbsp;30, about 520&nbsp;[[mile]]s (840&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) south-southeast of Bermuda.  Located to the south of a [[subtropical ridge]], the depression tracked steadily west-northwestward, and it attained tropical storm status 18&nbsp;hours after forming, based on a nearby ship observation.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

Tropical Storm Ella intensified quickly and reached hurricane status late on August&nbsp;31, based on confirmation from nearby ship reports and a [[Hurricane Hunters]] flight.<ref name="tcr"/> At the time, the hurricane was forecast to avoid making landfall on [[North Carolina]] and ultimately turn northeastward, although it was expected to pass within 50&nbsp;miles (85&nbsp;km) of land during the busy [[Labor Day Weekend]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|date=1978-08-31|title=Hurricane Ella Discussion|accessdate=2010-03-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/tropdisc/tcd3121z.jpg}}</ref> On September&nbsp;1, Ella reached a preliminary peak intensity of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h), a [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]] and a Category&nbsp;3 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. At the same time a [[trough (meteorology)|short-wave trough]] reached the [[East Coast of the United States]]. The trough caused the hurricane to decelerate and turn slightly to the north, and a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] behind the trough caused Ella to become nearly stationary for 24&nbsp;hours.<ref name="tcr"/> During that time, the threat toward the North Carolina coast diminished, and concurrently, the winds decreased as the convection diminished.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pelissier|date=1978-09-02|title=Hurricane Ella Discussion|accessdate=2010-03-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/tropdisc/tcd0209z.jpg}}</ref> 

On September&nbsp;3, another trough exited the coast of the United States, which turned Ella to the northeast and caused it to accelerate.<ref name="tcr"/> By that time, the winds had decreased to 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h),<ref name="tcr"/> although subsequent weakening was expected to be minimal, due to [[Baroclinity|baroclinic instability]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Pelissier|date=1978-09-03|title=Hurricane Ella Discussion|accessdate=2010-03-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/tropdisc/tcd0309z.jpg}}</ref> Instead, the hurricane began significantly re-intensifying. Early on September&nbsp;4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h); at the time it was about 335&nbsp;miles (540&nbsp;km) south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters.<ref name="tcr"/> At 38<U+00B0>[[Latitude|N]], Hurricane Ella reached Category 4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale further north than any other hurricane.<ref name="HURDAT">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Specialists Unit|publisher=National Hurricane Center|year=2009|accessdate=September 28, 2009|title=Easy to Read HURDAT 1851<U+2013>2008|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyread-2008.html}}</ref> Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures.<ref name="tcr"/> Early on September&nbsp;5, Ella passed very near [[Cape Race]], although the strongest winds were south and east of the center.<ref name="a24">{{cite web|author=John Hope|date=1978-09-05|title=Hurricane Ella Advisory 24|accessdate=2010-03-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/public/pub050400z.jpg}}</ref> The convection became completely removed from the center,<ref>{{cite web|author=Miles Lawrence|date=1978-09-05|title=Hurricane Ella Discussion|accessdate=2010-03-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/tropdisc/tcd0509z.jpg}}</ref> and the hurricane became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] as it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm.<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations and impact==

On September&nbsp;1, as Hurricane Ella was strengthening to its first peak in strength, the [[National Hurricane Center]] anticipated a track near the [[North Carolina]] coast during the busy [[Labor Day Weekend]]; as a result, the agency issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the [[Outer Banks]].<ref name="tcr"/> The [[Cape Hatteras]] [[National Weather Service]] office requested radio and television stations in the threatened area to continue broadcasting beyond normal hours, so to convey storm updates to people in the region.<ref>{{cite web|author=A.J.

The hurricane ultimately stayed far away from the coast,<ref name="tcr"/> and the heavy rainfall and thunderstorms remained at least 50&nbsp;miles (85&nbsp;km) offshore.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cape Hatteras National Weather Service|date=1978-09-02|title=Hurricane Ella Local Statement Number 10|accessdate=2010-03-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/local/hat021900z.jpg}}</ref> While nearly stationary, Hurricane Ella produced waves of 5 to 9&nbsp;feet (2 to 3&nbsp;metres) in height, as well as rip currents along the coast.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cape Hatteras National Weather Service|date=1978-09-02|title=Hurricane Ella Local Statement Number 12|accessdate=2010-03-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/local/hat022230z.jpg}}</ref> The highest wind gust from the storm was 31&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h) at [[Diamond Shoal Light]]. The waves reached the dunes along most beaches,<ref name="nc">{{cite web|author=A.J. Hull|work=Cape Hatteras National Weather Service|date=1978-09-07|title=Preliminary Report on Hurricane Ella|accessdate=2010-03-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/preloc/hat07.01.jpg}}</ref> causing some minor beach erosion; the depleted sand returned within a few days.<ref>{{cite web|author=Albert R.

Ultimately, the most significant effect from the hurricane was the significant drop in [[tourism]].<ref name="tcr"/> The [[Labor Day Weekend]] is typically the last significant week of the summer tourist season, and normally, many people vacation along the [[Outer Banks]]. Due to the hurricane watch, traffic was light, and many businesses and hotels reported much less business than usual. A forecaster with the [[National Weather Service]] said the hurricane watch was put into effect because of "thousands of people streaming in and only one road off the Outer Banks, [and they] couldn't wait wait until the last minute."<ref>{{cite web|author=Coastland Times|date=1978-09-07|title=News Clippings about Hurricane Ella|accessdate=2010-03-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/news/ct0907.01.jpg}}</ref> The same forecaster noted that a "alert" less than a hurricane watch "would have been used [during Ella].<ref name="nc"/>

No significant impact was reported in Canada,<ref name="tcr"/> as the strongest winds were south and east of the center.<ref name="a24"/> Prior to its arrival, the Newfoundland Weather Forecast Office issued a hurricane warning for southeastern Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert Clark|date=1978-09-04|title=Hurricane Ella Advisory 22|accessdate=2010-03-29|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/cdmp/dvd0076-jpg/1978/atlantic/ella/public/pub041600z.jpg}}</ref>

Due to a changing in [[tropical cyclone naming]] in 1979, the name "Ella" has not been used again in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="HURDAT"/>
