'''Liturgy''' ({{lang-el|<U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}) is the customary public [[worship]] done by a specific religious group, according to its particular traditions.

The word, sometimes rendered by its [[English language|English]] translation "service", may refer to an elaborate formal [[ritual]] such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Divine Liturgy]] ({{lang-el|<U+0398><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+039B><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}) and [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Catholic Mass]], or a daily activity such as the [[Muslim]] [[salat]]<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p.&nbsp;582&ndash;3</ref> and [[Jewish services]]. As a religious phenomenon, liturgy is a communal response to the sacred through activity reflecting praise, thanksgiving, [[supplication]], or repentance. Ritualization may be associated with life events such as birth, [[coming of age]], marriage and death. It thus forms the basis for establishing a relationship with a divine agency, as well as with other participants in the liturgy. Methods of dress, preparation of food, application of cosmetics or other hygienic practices are all considered liturgical activities.

The word liturgy is derived from the technical term in [[ancient Greek]], [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|''leitourgia'']], signifies the often expensive offers of service to the people, and thus to the ''[[polis]]'' and the state.<ref>N. Lewis, "''Leitourgia'' and related terms," ''Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'' '''3''' (1960:175<U+2013>84) and '''6''' (1965:226<U+2013>30).</ref> Through the ''leitourgia'' the rich carried a financial burden and were correspondingly rewarded with honours. The ''leitourgia'' became both mandatory and honorific, supporting the patron's standing among the elite.  The holder of a Hellenic ''leitourgia'' was not taxed a specific sum, but entrusted with a particular ritual, which could be performed with greater or lesser magnificence. The chief sphere remained that of civic religion, embodied in the festivals: [[Moses Finley|M.I. Finley]] notes "in [[Demosthenes]]' day there were at least 97 liturgical appointments in Athens for the festivals, rising to 118 in a (quadrennial) [[Panathenaic festival|Panathenaic year]]."<ref>Finley, ''The Ancient Economy'' 2nd ed., 1985:151.</ref> Eventually, under the [[Roman Empire]], such obligations, known as ''[[Munera (Roman contest)|Monera]]'', devolved into a competitive and ruinously expensive burden that was avoided when possible.

{{main|Christian liturgy}}
Frequently in [[Christianity]] a distinction is made between "liturgical" and "non-liturgical" churches based on the elaboration and/or antiquity of the worship; in this usage, churches whose services are unscripted or improvised are called "non-liturgical".  Others object to this usage, arguing that this terminology obscures the universality of public worship as a religious phenomenon.<ref>Underhill, E., ''Worship'' (London:  Bradford and Dickens, 1938), pp. 3&ndash;19.</ref> Thus, even the ''open'' or ''waiting'' worship of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] is liturgical, since the waiting itself until the Holy Spirit moves individuals to speak is a prescribed form of Quaker worship, sometimes referred to as "the liturgy of silence."<ref>Dandelion, P., ''The Liturgies of Quakerism'', Liturgy, Worship and Society Series (Aldershot, England and Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2005).</ref>  Typically in Christianity, however, the term "the liturgy" normally refers to a standardised order of events observed during a religious service, be it a [[sacrament]]al service or a service of public [[prayer]].  In the Catholic tradition, liturgy is considered to mean the participation of the people in the work of God and in the liturgy Jesus Christ is considered to continue the work of redemption in union with his Church.<ref>Catechism of the Catholic Church 1069(London: Chapman, 1994).</ref>

The term "liturgy" can also be used as a precise term that distinguishes between those religious groups who believe their ritual requires the "people" to do the "work" of responding to the priest, and those who do not (hence leitourgia = work of the people).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  As such, many Christian churches designate one person who participates in the worship service as the '''liturgist'''.  The liturgist may read announcements, scriptures, and calls to worship, while the minister preaches the sermon, offers prayers, and blesses sacraments.  The liturgist may be either a minister or a lay person.
