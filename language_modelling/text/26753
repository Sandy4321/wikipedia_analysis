{{For|the midget submarine of the Second World War|X class submarine}}

'''HM Submarine ''X1''''' was conceived and designed as a submersible [[commerce raider]] for the [[Royal Navy]]; at the time of her launching she was the largest submarine in the world. The idea of a [[submarine]] [[cruiser]] had been proposed as early as 1915, but was not put into practice until 1921. ''X1'', which was based on the uncompleted German [[German Type U 173 submarine|''U-173'']] class of 2,000-ton "U-Cruisers", was laid down on 2 November 1921 at the [[Chatham Dockyard|Naval Dockyard Chatham]] and completed on 23 September 1925, commissioning in December 1925.

The 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], of which Britain was a signatory, did not ban submarines but it did ban their use against merchant ships, which was ''X1''{{'}}s unacknowledged purpose; its armament had been designed to successfully engage the classes of vessels likely to be escorting convoys, such as [[destroyers]] and [[frigates]]. Therefore, a certain amount of secrecy surrounded ''X1'', the government even going to the lengths of taking a national newspaper to court over its pictures of the new submarine following her launch, all copies of the paper being seized.

==Description==
The ''X1''{{'}}s {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} thick [[Submarine hull#Pressure hull|pressure hull]] was {{convert|19|ft|7.5|in}} in diameter amidships, and was divided into 10 water-tight compartments. This was almost completely surrounded by her external hull which also contained the main [[ballast tank]]s and most of her fuel. Her intended maximum diving depth was {{convert|500|ft}} but was reduced to {{convert|350|ft}} once in service.<ref name=b>Brown 1982, p. 232</ref>

She was expected to sink her targets using gunfire and so was given four {{convert|5.2|in|adj=on}} guns to be able to defeat a destroyer or armed merchant ship although she was fitted with six bow tubes for [[British 21 inch torpedo|{{convert|21|in|adj=on}} torpedoes]] to supplement her guns.<ref>Akermann 2002, p. 217</ref>  

===Armament===
''X1'' carried four [[QF 5.2 inch Mk I]] guns in twin unarmoured turrets, one forward and one aft of the [[conning tower]]. They had a range of about {{convert|16000|yd}}. A circular trunk ran from each mounting to the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] in the pressure hull which contained 100 [[Cartridge (firearms)|rounds]] per gun. A working chamber which was {{convert|10|ft}} in diameter encircled the trunk between the pressure hull and the gun mount.<ref name=b/> Her ammunition hoists were problematic and could not sustain the desired rate of fire of six rounds per gun per minute. Special ballast tanks were used to compensate for the loss of weight as ammunition was fired. Working and control of the guns required no less than 58 crewmen.<ref name=a>Akermann 2002, p. 218</ref> The fire-control tower was in the middle of the [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] and had a top that could be raised {{convert|2|ft}} when in use. The upper control room was between the tower and the pressure hull. Just aft of the control room was the rangefinding room with a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} [[rangefinder]] on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] that could be raised {{convert|8|ft}}.<ref name=b/>  

Her six torpedo tubes came from a cancelled [[British L class submarine|L-class submarine]] and she was provided with one reload for each tube. It took some 24 minutes to reload them all because her torpedo room was space restricted.<ref name=a/>

===Propulsion===
The main engines were two 8-cylinder Admiralty [[diesel engine]]s with a total output of {{convert|3000|hp|kW}}. Two auxiliary {{convert|1200|hp|kW|adj=on}} [[MAN SE|MAN]] Diesel engines taken from [[SM U-126|''U-126'']] were installed for battery charging purposes. For underwater propulsion, two [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] electric motors of {{convert|1000|hp|kW}} each were fitted. It was hoped to achieve over {{convert|8000|hp|kW}} using both Diesels and electric motors together, but the highest power achieved (during a full power trial in March 1926) was {{convert|7135|hp|kW}}. She had three groups of batteries, each with 110 cells weighing a total of {{convert|70|LT|MT}}.<ref name=b2>Brown 1982 p. 233</ref>

In theory she could make {{convert|19.5|kn|km/h}} on the surface, and at economical speed she had a greater range than normal cruisers, but unfortunately both sets of diesel engines suffered from continual mechanical problems that reduced her speed and range.<ref name=b2/> The ''X1''{{'}}s average diving time (to periscope depth) was 2 minutes 20 seconds. Her handling underwater was considered superior to other submarines of the period.<ref name=a2>Akermann 2002, p. 220</ref>

==Career==
After ''X1'' was commissioned in December 1925 and accepted in April 1926 she made a voyage to [[Gibraltar]] after which her main engine drive wheels were found to be damaged. After repairs she was sent to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Her [[Port and starboard|starboard]] shaft broke during a full-power run in January 1928 and a new set of gears was needed, but after refitting at [[Malta]] her [[Port and starboard|port]] shaft broke in the same place in April 1928. By 1930 her commanding officer reported "internal arrangements not very satisfactory because of overcrowding with auxiliary machinery, accommodation is cramped, ventilation poor and the ship suffers from humidity, diving arrangements good."<ref name=b2/> Both the main and auxiliary engines were troublesome and she spent most of her time under repair, before being laid up.<ref name=b2/> ''X1'' was placed in reserve after 1930, before she was finally scrapped at [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke]] on 12 December 1936.<ref name=a2/>
