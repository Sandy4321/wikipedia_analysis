'''Thanjavur Nayaks''' were the rulers of [[Thanjavur]] principality of [[Tamil Nadu]] between the 16th to the 19th century C.E. Nayakas were subordinates of the imperial [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] emperors, and were appointed as provincial governors by the Vijaya Nagar Emperor. As the power of the Vijayanagar empire waned, they grew powerful and established independent authority in the areas they governed. [[Madurai]] and [[Gingee]] had their own Nayak rulers. The Thanjavur Nayak rule was established in the reign of Vijayanagar emperor [[Achyuta Deva Raya]] ([[1530]] <U+2013> [[1542]] C.E.) around [[1532]] C.E.  Chinna Sevvappa was the first ruler of the Thanjavur Nayak. Thanjavur Nayaks were notable for their patronage of literature and the arts.

== Origins of Nayak rule ==

With the demise of the [[Chola dynasty]] in 1279, [[Thanjavur]] was ruled by various small chieftains, until the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] conquered all of south India by the late 14th century. The Vijaynagar rulers installed viceroys to rule over various parts of the empire. In 1535 CE, [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], the brother and successor of [[Krishna Deva Raya]]) of Vijayanagar granted Chevappa Nayak, the governor of Thanjavur, permission to establish a feudatory kingdom. 

==Nayak kings==
=== Cevvappa Nayak ===

Cevvappa Nayak (1535-1590), was the first Thanjavur Nayak king.  He was the son of Timmappa Nayak, a Vijayanagara viceroy in the [[Arcot]] region. His wife Murtimamba was a sister of the Vijayanagara Queen Thirumalamba, Some sources suggest that he acquired the Thanjavur Kingdom as a part of the marriage alliance, while other sources point out that  Ceyyappa was a [[betel]] bearer to [[Achyuta Deva Raya]].

=== Achuthappa Nayak ===

Achuthappa Nayak (1564-1612), named in memory of [[Achyuta Deva Raya]], led peaceful reign of 48 years. Up till Achuthappa Nayak 1590 co- ruled with his father under the Yuvaraja title while immediately after that he was joined by his heir-son Raghunatha Nayak. He was said to be deeply religious and was well considered a master in the art of warfare. His minister was Govinda Diksita, a great scholar and a shrewd administrator. His long reign was of comparative peace apart from the internal struggles enabling him to contribute much to spiritual and public utility development.
====Conflicts and Wars====
=====Wars with Madurai=====
During Achuthappa's reign, the Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by the [[Deccan Sultanates]] armies at the [[battle of Talikota]]. Later when the [[Vijaynagara rulers]] re-established their capital in Chandragiri and Vellore under Sriranga Rayas, Achuthappa Nayak continued his loyalty while [[Gingee]] and [[Madurai Nayaks]] intended to break free by refusing to pay tribute. This would also lead to bitter animosity between the [[Madurai Nayaks]] and the Tanjore Nayaks ultimately leading to the Battle at Vallamprakara where the Tanjore army with the Rayas fought against Veerappa Nayak of [[Madurai]] by defeating the later. Same time when the Rayas of [[Chandragiri]] were waging wars with the [[Deccan Sultanates]] in southern [[Andhra Pradesh]] Achuthappa Nayak provided support.

=====Wars with Portugal===== 
[[Portugal]] controlled the [[Nagapattinam]] territory as well as the Colombo province in [[Ceylon]] and the entire West Coast of India. The King of [[Jaffna]] went into a war against Portugal against the methods adopted by the missionary conversions in Jaffna. Later King of Jaffna sought help from the Tanjore Nayaks in repelling Portuguese advances through many battles.

====Public Contributions====
Achuthappa Nayak was deeply religious from his young days and the fertile nature of his country helped him make large contributions in gifts and infrastructure to major Temples and also important irrigation systems. The main benefactor was the [[Srirangam Temple]]. His assistant and advisor was his [[minister]] Govinda Diksita.
=====Srirangam Temple=====
The [[Srirangam]] Temple towers (Gopurams) of the North and West and the eighth Prakara (temple Wall Street) and several Halls (Mandapam) inside the Temple complex were built by him. The Golden Vimana of the inner most shrines (Temple Flag) and the image of God studded with Crown jewels was presented by Achuthappa Nayak.
=====Other Temples=====
His other major contributions include the Pushyamantapas (Halls) with steps leading to river [[Cauvery]] in [[Mayavaram]], [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], [[Tiruvadi]] and [[Kumbakonam]] and Golden Kalasas of [[Tiruvannamalai]] Temple Gopurams (Towers) some of the Gopurams in Rameswaram. Several temples in [[Arcot]] and [[Tanjore]] regions namely Temples in [[Tiruvidaimarudur]] and [[Chidambaram]] received Villages as grants.
=====Irrigation===== 
His one remarkable contribution is the construction of a dam across Cauvery near Tiruvadi leading to efficient irrigation in its vicinity.
=====Housing=====
Numerous Agraharas (Housing for [[Brahmins]]) in Tanjore country were built in his period.
====Final years====
During his last days the Rayas now ruling from [[Chandragiri]] and [[Vellore]] had rival claimants within the family to the title and were heading for a war with the other Nayak kings taking sides for their vested interests.

=== Raghunatha Nayak ===

Ragunatha Nayak (1612-1634) is regarded as the greatest in the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty. He is famous for his patronage of literature other scholarly research. One of his wives, Ramabhadrama was highly educated and a gifted poet. During his time he granted military assistance to the Chandragiri ruler Venkatagiri to recover most of his lost areas from the [[Golconda]] forces. In 1620 Raghunatha Nayak permitted a Dutch settlement at [[Tarangambadi]].  This encouraged the English to seek trade with the Thanjavur Nayaks.  

Raghnatha was a gifted scholar in both [[Sanskrit]] and [[Telugu language]], as well as a talented musician. His court was distinguished for its assembly of poets and scholars.  Ragunatha is credited with writing several books on music and Telugu literature. Maduravani and Ramabhadramba were two famous poetesses in his court, while Sudhindra and Raghavendra were two famous Madhva gurus patronised by him. Govinda Dikshita's son Yajnanarayana has written an account on Raghunatha's rule in his work ''Sahitya Ratnakara''. 

It was during Raghunatha's reign that a palace library was established.  Sarasvati Bhandar, where manuscripts of Raghunatha<U+2019>s prolific court scholars  were collected and preserved. This library was to be developed and enriched later by Rajah [[Serfoji II]] into the current famous [[Saraswati Mahal Library]].

=== Vijaya Raghava Nayak===

Vijaya Raghava Nayak (1645-1673), was the last of the Nayak Kings of Thanjavur. His long reign witnessed a large amount of literary output both in music and Telugu literature.  Vijayaraghava<U+2019>s court had a number of poets and literary scholars. Vijayaraghava Nayaka wrote more than thirty books in Telugu. His long reign  sadly came to an abrupt end by the Chokkanatha Nayak of Madurai.

== End of Nayak rule ==
''for additional details see'' [[Chokkanatha Nayak]]

The end of the Thanjavur Nayak dynasty was brought on by [[Chokkanatha Nayak]], the  [[Nayak of Madurai]]. The dispute was due to the refusal of Vijaya Ragava to give his daughter in marriage to Chokkanatha Nayak. Chokkantha determined to fetch the maiden by force back into their capital, successfully stormed the Thanjavur palace in 1673 after flattening much of the fort walls by cannons. But Chokkanatha was thwarted in his attempts by Vijaya Ragava, when  he, in a gruesome act of defiance, blew up his daughter and all the other ladies of the palace. He then charged at the attacking army with his son and his body-guard. He was captured after a brief fight, and was beheaded by the Madurai General Venkata Krishnappa.

== Maratha conquest ==

Chokkanatha placed his brother Alagiri on the throne of Thanjavur, but within a year the latter threw off his allegiance, and Chokkanatha was forced to recognise the independence of Thanjavur. A son of Vijaya Raghava induced the Bijapur Sultan to help his get back  the Thanjavur throne. In 1675, the Sultan of Bijapur sent a force commanded by the Maratha general Venkaji (alias Ekoji) to drive away the Madurai usurper. Venkaji defeated Alagiri with ease, and occupied Thanjavur. He did not, however, place his protege on the throne as instructed by the Bijapur Sultan, but seized the kingdom and made himself king. Thus ended the reign of Nayaks and the start of Maratha power in Thanjavur.
