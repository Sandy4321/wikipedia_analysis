'''Merritt College''' is a two-year [[community college]] located in the [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|Oakland Hills]] in [[Alameda County]], [[California]]. The school's enrollment is approximately 6,000 students.  The college is named after physician Dr. [[Samuel Merritt]].

The college, in addition to the other three campuses of the Peralta College District, is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]].

==History==
The college is part of the [[Peralta Community College District]] and was opened as a general campus in 1954 (it had been known as the Merritt School of Business, and along with what is now [[Laney College]], operated by the [[Oakland Unified School District]] as Oakland Junior College, which became the nucleus of the Peralta Colleges). In 1966, two Merritt College students, [[Huey Newton]] and [[Bobby Seale]] formed the [[Black Panther Party]].

The college originally opened in the former Grove Street campus of [[University High School (Oakland, California)|University High School]] (1923<U+2013>1948), located at what is now 5714 Martin Luther King Jr. Way.  This site, now rehabilitated and serving as the north campus of the [[Children's Hospital Oakland|Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland]], was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref>[http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/University_High_School ArchiPlanet, ''University High School''], accessed May 24, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.merritt.peralta.edu/apps/page.asp?Q=704 Merritt College and Peralta District History Archive], accessed May 24, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.oaklandnet.com/celebrate/Historytimeline.htm City of Oakland, Oakland History Timeline], accessed May 24, 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/CA/Alameda/vacant.html NRHP, CALIFORNIA - Alameda County - Vacant / Not In Use], accessed May 24, 2007</ref>

The original location of Merritt College was used as the primary filming location for the 1987 film, "The Principal."  Starring James Belushi.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The present campus was opened in 1971, the result of a 1965 bond issue which also established a new downtown Oakland campus building for Laney College and the founding of the [[College of Alameda]].

==Occupational programs==
Merritt College's occupational programs include nursing and health professions, community social services/substance abuse counseling, environmental hazardous materials technology, computer information systems, landscape horticulture and environmental management, paralegal studies, and restoration technology.
