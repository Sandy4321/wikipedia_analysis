The '''German occupation of Belgium during World War I''' refers to the military occupation of [[Belgium]] by the forces of the [[German Empire]] between 1914 and 1918. Captured in 1914 during the [[German invasion of Belgium|German invasion of neutral Belgium]], the country was almost completely overrun before the winter of the same year. The Belgian government went into exile, while [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]] and the Belgian Army continued to fight on [[Yser Front|a section]] of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Under the German military, Belgium was divided into three separate zones. The majority of the country became the [[General Governorate of Belgium|General Governorate]], ruled by a German general. The occupation coincided with a widespread economic collapse with shortages and widespread unemployment, but also with a religious revival. Relief organisations, which relied on foreign support to bring food and clothing to Belgian civilians, also became extremely important.

The German occupation administration repressed political dissent and launched numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour. It also supported the [[Flemish Movement]] by making numerous concessions as part of the ''[[Flamenpolitik]]''. As a result, numerous resistance movements were founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers.

The occupation ended as the Allied advance into Belgium during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] from August 1918 but, in most areas, was only brought to an end by [[First Armistice at Compi<U+00E8>gne|the German surrender]] of November 1918.

==Background==
[[File:Blankenberge WO I.jpg|thumb|German troops marching through [[Blankenberge]] in 1914]]
{{main|Belgium in the long nineteenth century|German invasion of Belgium}}
Following [[Belgian Revolution|its independence]] in 1830, Belgium had been obliged to remain neutral in perpetuity by an [[Treaty of London (1839)|1839 treaty]] as part of a guarantee for its independence. Before the war, Belgium was a [[constitutional monarchy]] and was noted for being one of the most [[industrialization|industrialised]] countries in the world.{{sfn|Hobsbawm|1995|pp=41<U+2013>2}} On 4 August 1914, the [[German invasion of Belgium|German army invaded Belgium]] just days after presenting an ultimatum to the Belgian government to allow free passage of German troops across its borders. The German army advanced rapidly into Belgium, besieging and capturing the fortified cities of [[Battle of Li<U+00E8>ge|Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Siege of Namur (1914)|Namur]] and [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Antwerp]] and pushing the combined Belgian, French and British armies to the far west. Large numbers of refugees also fled to neighbouring countries. In October 1914, the German advance was finally stopped near the French border by a Belgian force [[Battle of the Yser|at the Yser]] and by a combined Franco-British force [[First Battle of the Marne|at the Marne]]. As a result, the front line stabilized with most of Belgium already under German control. In the absence of any decisive offensive, most of Belgium remained under German control until the end of the war.

While most of Belgium was occupied, [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]] continued to command the [[Belgian Army]] along a section of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], known as the [[Yser Front]], through [[West Flanders]] from his headquarters in [[Veurne]]. The [[De Broqueville government in exile|Belgian government]], led by [[Charles de Broqueville]], established itself in exile in [[Le Havre]] in northern France. 

===The Rape of Belgium===
{{main|The Rape of Belgium}}
During the course of their advance through Belgium, the Germans committed a number of [[war crime]]s against the Belgian civilian population, which they accused of fighting as ''[[Franc-Tireur|Francs-Tireurs]]'' or [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]] against them.{{sfn|Kramer|2007|pp=1-27}} Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as the [[The Rape of Belgium]]. As many as 6,500 were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In [[Leven]], the historic library of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834<U+2013>1968)|city's university]] was destroyed. The news of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the Belgian civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of Belgian civilians and Belgian refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda until the end of the war.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|pp=140-1}}

==Administration==
[[File:German occupation of Belgium 1914-1916.jpg|thumb|Map of German-occupied Belgium]]
From November 1914, occupied Belgium, together with the occupied French border areas of [[Givet]] and [[Fumay]], was divided by the Germans into three zones.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=113-4}} The first, the ''Operationsgebied'' (Operational Zone), covered the a small amount of territory near the front line in the far west of Belgium. Near this zone was the ''Etappengebied'' (Staging Zone), covering most of [[East Flanders|East]] and [[West Flanders]] along with parts of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Luxembourg (province)|Luxembourg]]. The remainder of the country, was the largest of the zones, the ''[[General Governorate of Belgium|Generalgouvernement]]'' (General Governorate), which covered the majority of the country and the French territories.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=114}} Unlike the Operational and Staging Zones, the General Governorate was intended to be a total administration and so was markedly less repressive that the other two zones whose governance was based on military concerns alone.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=114}} Civilians in the Operational and Staging Zones were officially classed as "prisoners" by the German military.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}} 

The Governorate General was placed under the command of a German general who was accountable to the Army. After a brief tenure by [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Colmar von der Goltz]] in 1914, command was held by [[Moritz von Bissing]] and later, from April 1917, by [[Ludwig von Falkenhausen]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=114}} The German authorities aimed to use the occupation to benefit the German economy and industrial production but hoped to keep the Belgian state and economy functioning if it did not impede their main objectives.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=113}}

Administratively, the German administration had a ''Zivilverwaltung'' (Civil Administration) tasked with dealing with day-to-day matters and a network of local ''Kommandanturen'' in towns and cities across Belgium. It could also call on up to 80,000 soldiers.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=114}} In most cases, however, the administration was content to use the existing Belgian civil service and [[local government]] for much of its administration.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=115}}

==Life under the occupation==
===Religious life===
The occupation coincided with a religious revival.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=127}} The [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Belgium, Cardinal [[D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9>-Joseph Mercier]], became an outspoken critic of the German occupation publishing a noted call for "patriotism and endurance", calling for civilians to only observe occupation laws which were consistent with patriotism and [[Christian ethics|Christian values]], at Christmas 1914.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=127}} In the absence of the King or government, Mercier became the predominant figure in occupied Belgium and a symbol of resistance.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=129}} Because of his status, Mercier could not be arrested and, although lured back to the Vatican by the Germans to remove him from Belgium in 1915, he soon returned. In 1916, Mercier was banned from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=128-30}} Initially opposed by [[Pope Benedict XV]], who was anxious to remain neutral, Benedict supported the Belgian church but encouraging it to moderate its stance.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=128}}

===Economic life===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2008-0084, Belgien, Flandern, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|War damage in Flanders in 1914]]
At the start of the war, the Belgian government hurried removed [[silver]] coins from circulation and replace them with banknotes.{{sfn|BNB Museum|2013}} With the German occupation, these banknotes remained legal and their production continued. To offset the costs of occupation, the German administration demanded regular "war contributions" of 35 million [[Belgian franc]]s each month.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=94}} The contribution considerably exceeded Belgium's pre-war tax income and so, in order to pay it, Belgian banks used new paper money to buy bonds.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=94}} The excessive printing of money, coupled with large amounts of German money brought into the country by soldiers, led to considerable [[inflation]].{{sfn|BNB Museum|2013}}

Fiscal chaos, coupled with problems of transportation and the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers.{{sfn|BNB Museum|2013}} Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}} To cope with the economic conditions, large numbers of individual communes and regions began to print and issue their own money, known as [[Notgeld|Necessity Money]], which could be used locally.{{sfn|BNB Museum|2013}}

The Germans also artifically [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed the exchange rate]] between the [[German Papiermark|German mark]] and the Belgian franc to benefit their own economy at a ratio of 1:1.25.{{sfn|BNB Museum|2013}}

===Relief organisations===
Before the war, Belgium had been a net importer of foodstuffs. The German invasion, together with the Allied blockade meant that as early as September 1914, various Belgian organisations had been preparing for the onset of [[famine]] in the occupied territory. Under the direction of a financier, [[<U+00C9>mile Francqui]], and other philanthropists established the ''[[Comit<U+00E9> National de Secours et d'Alimentation]]'' (CNSA or the "National Relief and Food Committee") to secure and transport food to Belgium, where it could be sold to Belgian civilians.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=120-1}} The profits from this part of the operation were then used to distribute aid. After negotiations with both the Allies and Central Powers, the CNSA managed to secure permission to import food from the neutral United States. Francqui used his acquaintance with [[Herbert Hoover]], the future American President, to collect food and other relief through an American organization, the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]] (CRB), which was then distributed within Belgium by the CNSA.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=122}} A number of smaller relief organisations affiliated to other neutral countries also worked within occupied Belgium.

The CNSA became a major part of everyday life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfill much of the day-to-day running of the Belgian state and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=123}} Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as a parallel government structure and became a symbol of [[passive resistance]]. The actions of the official government in peacetime while also serving as a symbol of national unity.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=122-6}}

==German policies==
===Deportation and forced labour===
The conscription of German men at the start of the war created a manpower shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany, but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}} By mid 1916, the German administration began considering the idea of forcibly deporting Belgian workers, encouraged by the high levels of unemployment in occupied Belgium.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}} The deportation begun in October 1916 and lasted until March 1917.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}} In all, as many as 100,000 workers had been deported to Germany by the end of the war.{{sfn|Cook|2004|pp=102-7}} In addition, in the Staging Zone, around 62,000 workers were conscripted as forced labour on local military projects in poor conditions.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=131}}

The deportation proved insufficient to meet German needs and economically had little effect.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=132}} Politically, however, it led to widespread condemnation in Belgium and internationally, helping the rise of the resistance.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=132}}

===Flemish Movement and the ''Flamenpolitik''===
{{main|Flamenpolitik}}
[[File:Raad van vlaanderen.gif|thumb|upright|left|Poster from the ''[[Raad van Vlaanderen (World War I)|Raad van Vlaanderen]]'' (RVV) announcing Flemish independence]]
In the years leading up to the outbreak of the war, the [[Flemish Movement]] had become an increasing phenomenon in Belgian politics. Traditionally, French had been the dominant language of the Belgian government and among the upper class of Belgian society. After a period of marginalization, the Flemish Movement succeeded in achieving increased status for Dutch language, culminating in the legal recognition of Dutch in 1898. In 1914 new laws were passed giving further concessions to the movement, but the outbreak of war meant that these could not be acted on and numerous grievances were left unaddressed.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=133}} Among the outstanding grievances was the [[University of Ghent]], situated in Flanders, in which all teaching was only conducted in French.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=133}}

In 1915, the Governor General decided to launch the ''[[Flamenpolitik]]'' (Flemish Policy) to use the animosity between the two language groups to facilitate the administration of the territory. Initially, the policy was restricted to implementing the 1914 language laws, but became increasingly more radical.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=133}} In 1916, Von Bissing opened a new university in Ghent, dubbed [[Von Bissing University]], in which all teaching was in Dutch with limited success.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=133-4}} The Germans also reached out to the comparable [[Walloon Movement]], but with much less success.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=136}} The policies divided the Flemish Movement between the radical "activists" (''activisten'' or ''maximalisten''), who welcomed the German measures and believed German support was essential to realizing their objectives, and the "passivists" (''passivisten''), who opposed the Germans and worried that this might discredit the movement.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}} In particular, the activists hoped that Flemish independence could be realized with German support.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}}

In February 1917, a ''[[Raad van Vlaanderen (World War I)|Raad van Vlaanderen]]'' (RVV or the "Council of Flanders") was formed with tacit German support.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}} Its members, all ''activisten'', were broadly supported by the Germans but were condemned by other ''[[flamingants]]'' and the Church.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}} On 22 December 1917, RVV's declared Flanders to be independent and dissolved itself to prepare for elections for a Flemish government.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}}{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=197}} The German authorities viewed the declaration ambivalently and in January 1918 refused a draft Flemish constitution presented by the RVV.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=197}} 50,000 people registered to vote in the coming elections but there were clashes with opponents in [[Mechelen]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Tienen]].{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=134}} The [[Court of Appeal (Belgium)|Belgian Court of Appeal]] sent out warrants for the arrest of two leading members of the council, [[Pieter Tack]] and [[August Borms]], but the Germans freed them and instead deported the judges responsible. In protest, judges at the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]], the highest appeal court, refused to try cases and other judges also went on strike.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=134-5}} Faced with mounting opposition, the Germans stopped the planned elections in March 1918.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=135}}

===Political repression===
[[File:SpaarnestadPhoto-Wire-of-Death-SFA001009994.jpg|thumb|The German-constructed [[Wire of Death]] along the Belgian-Dutch border]]
Public opposition to the German occupiers was heavily repressed. Displays of patriotism, such as singing the national anthem, ''[[La Braban<U+00E7>onne]]'', or celebrating [[Belgian National Day]] were banned and those breaking the rules risked strict prison sentances.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=98}} Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=98}} Numerous high profile Belgian figures, including [[Adolphe Max]], the mayor of Brussels, and the historian [[Henri Pirenne]], were imprisoned in Germany as hostages.

In order to stop civilians fleeing Belgium into the neutral Netherlands, the Germans began work on an [[electric fence|electrified fence]] across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the [[Wire of Death]] (''Dodendraad''), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000-3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.

Captured resistance members were also executed by the German authorities. Famously, [[Edith Cavell]], a British nurse who had lived in Belgium before the war, was arrested after helping Allied soldiers to escape the country and was executed by a German firing squad in 1915. Another ''r<U+00E9>sistante'', [[Gabrielle Petit]], who had participated in various forms of resistance activity, was executed in 1916 at the ''[[Tir national]]''.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=117}}

==Resistance==
[[File:La Libre Belgique June 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[La Libre Belgique]]'', one of the best known [[underground newspaper]]s of the occupation]]
A [[resistance movement]] developed in Belgium soon after the German occupation. The resistance took various forms. Although some sabotages by the resistance, notably the destruction of the Brussels-Aachen railway line, were celebrated at the time, armed resistance represented a minority of their acts.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125}} Around 300 separate resistance networks existed which often included both male and female members.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125}}

In particular, intelligence gathering played a major role. Around 6,000 Belgian civilians were involved in gathering intelligence on German military installations and troop movements and communicating it back to the Allied armies.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=115}} The organization was run through a large number of independent groups and included, notably, the large ''[[Dame Blanche (resistance)|Dame Blanche]]'' (White Lady) network.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125}} Alongside intelligence gathering were similar organisations which helped men wishing to join the [[Belgian Army]] on the Yser Front escape occupied Belgium, usually to the neutral Netherlands. Around 32,000 were successfully smuggled out which boosted the size of the Belgian force considerably.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125}}

In addition, [[underground newspaper]]s also formed a big part of resistance activity. The newspapers provided information censored in the approved press and also patriotic propaganda.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125; 127}} Some underground papers, most notably ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' (The Free Belgium) and ''[[De Vlaamsche Leeuw (newspaper)|De Vlaamsche Leeuw]]'' (The Flemish Lion), could reach large numbers of people.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=127}} At its height, ''La Libre Belgique'' had 600 individual contributors.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|p=125}}

The majority form of opposition, however, was passive resistance. Small patriotic badges, depicting the royal family or national colours, were extremely popular.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=100}} When these were symbols were banned, new ones, such as [[Hedera|ivy leaves]], were worn with similar meaning. Workers in strategic industries deliberately underperformed in their jobs as a form of resistance.{{sfn|Kossmann|1987|pp=525, 528<U+2013>9}} The celebration of nationalist public holidays, like 21 July (National Day), which were officially banned by the Germans, were also often accompanied by protests and demonstrations. One of the most notable acts of passive resistance was the Judges' Strike of 1918, which managed to gain concessions from the German occupiers under considerable public pressure.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2010|pp=134-5}}

==End of the occupation==
During the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], the Allied and Belgian armies launched a series of successful offensives on the Western Front. The Belgian army, restricted to the Yser since 1914, advanced as far as [[Bruges]]. German forces on the front in Belgium launched a wide retreat. On 11 November 1918, the German army [[First Armistice at Compi<U+00E8>gne|signed an armistice]]. The ceasefire did not, however, lead to the immediate liberation of Belgium and sporadic fighting continued.{{sfn|La Libre Belgique|2008}} The Belgian army gradually advanced into the country, behind the evacuating German occupying force.

Following [[Kiel mutiny|a mutiny in Kiel]] at the end of October, [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>19|a wave of revolutions]] broke out among the German army. In occupied Belgium, soldiers of the Brussels garrison mutinied against their officers on 10 November 1918. The revolutionaries formed a Soldiers' Council (''Soldatenrat'') and flew the [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]] over the Brussels ''Kommandantur'' while many officers, including the Governor-General, left the city for Germany. Fighting in the streets soon broke out between German loyalists and revolutionaries.{{sfn|RTBF|2014}} With the German police no longer keeping order, anarchy broke out in the city which was only restored when Belgian troops arrived.{{sfn|RTBF|2014}} The remaining German forces in Belgium began moving eastwards towards the German border, gradually evacuating more territory. The final German troops left the country on 23 November.{{sfn|RTBF|2014}}

On 22 November, Albert I entered Brussels with the Belgian army of the Yser in a [[Joyous Entry]]. The King was widely acclaimed by the civilian population. In total, 40,000 Belgian soldiers and civilians were killed and 77,500 wounded during World War I.{{sfn|Zuckerman|2004|p=220}}
