==Etymology==
The scientific name of the common species is ''Taurotragus oryx'', composed of three words: ''tauros'', ''tragos'' and ''oryx''. ''Tauros'' is [[Greek language|Greek]] for a bull or bullock, meaning the same as the [[Latin]] ''taurus''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taurus|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Tauro&searchmode=none|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> ''Tragos'' is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tragos|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tragos&searchmode=none|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>  ''Oryx'' is Latin and Greek (generally ''orygos'') for [[pickaxe]], which focuses at the pointed horns of North African antelopes like common eland and [[scimitar-horned oryx]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oryx|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=Taurotragus+oryx&searchmode=none|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref>  The common name ''eland'' is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for [[elk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tititudorancea.com/z/common_eland.htm |title=Common Eland |publisher=Tititudorancea.com |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

Their [[Fur|pelage]] differs from place to place. North African elands have distinctive markings, which fade away in South African elands.<ref name=estes>{{cite book|last=Estes |first= RD | title = The Safari Companion: A Guide to Watching African Mammals, Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, and Primates | year = 1999 | publisher = Chelsea Green Publishing | isbn=0-9583223-3-3| pages = [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Xqp7poFviNcC&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q&f=false 154]  | chapter = Bushbuck Tribe }}</ref> Coats are generally smooth over most of the body except for a rough mane. Females have a tan coat, while males have a darker tan coat with a bluish-grey tinge; there may also be a series of white stripes vertically on the sides of bulls (mainly in parts of the [[Karoo]] in [[South Africa]]).  As males age they tend to turn a greyer color. Males have dense [[fur]] on their foreheads and a large [[dewlap]] on their throats.<ref name = Pappas/>

Both sexes have horns with a steady spiral ridge (resembling that of the [[bushbuck]]). The horns are visible as small buds in newborns and grow rapidly during the first seven months.<ref name="skinner"/> The horns of males are thicker and shorter than those of females ({{convert|43|-|66|cm}} long versus {{convert|51|-|69|cm}}), as well as having a tighter spiral.  Horns are used by males during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting season]] to wrestle and [[headbutt|butt heads]] with rivals, while females will stab [[predation|predators]] with their horns.<ref name = Pappas/> 

Common elands are the slowest antelope, with a peak speed of {{convert|40|km}} per hour that tires them quickly, but can maintain a {{convert|22|km}} per hour [[Trot (horse gait)|trot]] indefinitely.  Elands are capable of jumping up to {{convert|2.5|m}} from a standing start when startled<ref name=estes/> (up to {{convert|3|m}} for young elands).<ref name = Pappas/>  Life expectancy is generally between 15 and 20 years, with some living up to 25 years.<ref name = Pappas/>  

Eland herds are accompanied by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation.  It is believed that the weight of the animal causes the two halves of its [[hoof|hooves]] to splay apart, and the clicking is the result of the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg.<ref name="Carnaby2008">{{cite book | author = Carnaby T | title = Beat About the Bush: Mammals | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=4u-VroUwC6QC&pg=PA172#v=onepage&q&f=false 172] | year = 2008 | publisher = [[Jacana Media]] |isbn = 978-1-77009-240-2 }}</ref>  The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.<ref name = "seaworld1">{{cite web | url = http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/artiodactyla/common-eland.htm | title = Animal Bytes <U+2013> Common Eland | publisher = Seaworld.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-08}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Afrika-Savanne Tiergarten N<U+00FC>rnberg.JPG|thumb|160px|right|Juvenile East African eland (''Tragelaphus oryx pattersonianus'').]]
The common eland was first described in 1766 by the German [[zoologist]] and [[botanist]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]]. It belongs to the order [[Artiodactyla]], family [[Bovid]]ae and subfamily [[Bovinae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Common_eland::sub::Taxonomy |title=Common eland: Taxonomy |publisher=Museumstuff.com |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>  Common eland are sometimes considered part of the [[genus]] ''[[Tragelaphus]]'' on the basis of [[molecular phylogenetics]], but are usually categorized as ''[[Taurotragus]]'', along with the [[giant eland]] (''T. derbianus'').<ref name=Pappas/>

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies of common eland have been recognized, although their validity requires investigation.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name=Pappas/><ref name=wilson>{{cite book | last = Wilson | first= DE | title = Mammal Species of the World: A

* '''''T. o. livingstonii''''' ([[Philip Sclater|Sclater]], 1864; Livingstone's eland): also called ''kaufmanni'', ''niediecki'', ''selousi'', and ''triangularis''. It is found in the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]]. Livingstone's eland has a brown pelt with up to twelve stripes.
* '''''T. o. oryx''''' ([[Peter Simon Pallas|Pallas]],  1766; Cape eland): also called ''alces'', ''barbatus'', ''canna'', ''oreas''. It is found in south and southwest Africa. The fur is [[tawny (color)|tawny]], and adults lose their stripes.
* '''''T. o. pattersonianus''''' ([[Richard Lydekker|Lydekker]], 1906; east African eland): also called ''billingae''. It is found in east Africa, hence its name. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes.

==Diseases and parasites==
Common elands are resistant to [[trypanosomiasis]], a bacterial infection that has the [[tsetse fly]] as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and show few [[symptom]]s when infected by the ''[[Rhipicephalus]]''-transmitted disease [[theileriosis]]. However infection by one strain of the disease-causing bacteria (''Theileria taurotragi'') can be lethal.  ''[[Clostridium chauvoei]]'' can also be harmful.  Elands are hosts to several kinds of [[tick]]s.  Elands produce [[antibody|antibodies]] to [[Brucella]] bacteria, but none for ''[[Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis|Mycobacterium paratuberculosis]]'' or various types of [[pneumonia]] that are normally infectious in cows or antelopes.<ref name=Pappas/>

==Genetics and evolution==
Male elands have 31 and females 32 [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] chromosomes <U+2013> the male (Y) chromosome has been [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] to the [[Centromere#Acrocentric|short arm]] of an [[autosome]].<ref name = Pappas/>  Both the [[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]] [[Replication (statistics) |replicate]] late, that is to say they do not agree well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the [[greater kudu]] (''Tragelaphus strepsiceros'')<ref name=taxo>{{cite book | last = Groves | first = CP | coauthors = Grubb P | title = Ungulate Taxonomy | year = 2011 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | location = Maryland | isbn = 978-1-4214-0093-8 | pages = [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=v3uZtA1ZpTAC&pg=PA142#v=onepage&q&f=false 142] | chapter = Artiodactyla }}</ref> and the male eland and female greater kudu can produce a viable male [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], though it is not known if it is [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]].  An attempt at crossing an eland with a kudu in a zoo produced a sterile hybrid.  Female elands can also act as [[surrogacy|surrogates]] for [[Bongo (antelope)|bongos]].<ref name = Pappas/>

The [[Bovid]]ae [[Family (biology)|family]] ancestors of the common eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa, with [[fossil]]s found throughout the continent (as well as some in [[France]]) and the best record appearing in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].  The first members of the ''Tragelaphini'' (the eland's [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]) appear 6 million years in the past during the [[late Miocene]]. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (''Taurotragus arkelli'') appears in the [[Pleistocene]] and the first ''T. oryx'' fossil appears in the [[Holocene]].<ref name = Pappas/>

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Taurotragus oryx (herd).jpg|thumb|Common elands resting in herds.]]
Common elands are [[nomad]]ic and [[crepuscular]], feeding in the morning and evening, resting in shade when hot and remaining in sunlight when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months.  [[Juvenile (organism)|Juveniles]] and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually.  During [[Estrus cycle|estrus]], groups tend to form more regularly.<ref name = Pappas/>  In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of [[zebra]]s, [[roan antelope]]s and [[oryx]]es.<ref name = Burton>{{cite book | last = Burton | first = RM | title = International wildlife encyclopedia | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Marshall Cavendish]] | location = New York | isbn = 0-7614-7266-5 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=0gsPc5lk7_UC&pg=PA757 757-8] | edition = 3 | chapter = Eland }}</ref> 

Common elands [[animal communication|communicate]] via gestures, vocalizations, [[Olfaction|scent cues]] and [[Display (zoology)|display behaviors]].  The [[flehmen response]] also occurs, primarily in males in response to contact with female urine or genitals.  Females will urinate to both indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, as well as to indicate lack of fertility when harassed by males.<ref name = Pappas/>  Eland bulls will bark and attempt to attract the attention of others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd feels, with the bulls in the rear.<ref name=Burton/>  Some of their main [[predator]]s include [[lion]]s, [[Lycaon pictus|wild dogs]], [[cheetah]]s and [[spotted hyena]]s, with juvenile elands being more vulnerable than adults.<ref name = Pappas/>

==Habitat and distribution==

[[File:Taurotragus oryx distribution.png|thumb|left|Distribution of the common eland over the [[savannas]] and [[plain]]s in eastern and southern [[Africa]].]]
Common eland live on the open plains of southern Africa and along the foothills of the great southern African plateau. The species extends north into [[Ethiopia]] and most arid zones of [[Sudan]], to the east into western [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]], and now even into [[South Africa]] (Lydon). However, there is low density of elands in Africa due to poaching, human settlement etc. There are at least 3 elands/sq&nbsp;mi (1.2/km<sup>2</sup>).<ref name="thinkquest1"/> The species has been reintroduced in [[Zimbabwe]]. 

Elands prefer to live in semi-arid areas that contain many shrub-like bushes, and often inhabit grasslands, woodlands, sub-desert, bush and mountaintops of altitudes about 15,000&nbsp;ft (4600&nbsp;m).<ref name=adw>{{cite web|title=Taurotragus Oryx:Information|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Taurotragus_oryx.html|work=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|publisher=Animal Diversity Web}}</ref>  Elands do, however, avoid forests, swamps, and deserts. The places inhabited by elands generally contain ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Combretum]]'', ''[[Commiphora]]'',  ''[[Diospyros]]'', ''[[Grewia]]'', ''[[Rhus]]'' and ''[[Ziziphus]]'' trees and shrubs, and some of these also serve as their food.

Elands can be found in many National Parks and reserves today, like [[Nairobi]] and Tsavo National Park, [[Masai Mara National Reserve|Masai Mara NR]], [[Kenya]]; [[Serengeti]], [[Ruaha]], and [[Tarangire National Park]], Ngorongoro Crater, [[Tanzania]]; [[Kagera National Park]], [[Rwanda]]; [[Nyika National Park]], [[Malawi]]; [[Luangwa Valley]] and [[Kafue National Park]], [[Zambia]]; [[Hwange National Park|Hwange]] and [[Matobo National Park]], Tuli Safari Area, [[Zimbabwe]]; [[Kruger National Park]], [[Giant's Castle]], [[Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve|Suikerbosrand NR]], [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wackywildlifewonders.com/files/animals/eland.html |title=Wild Animals of Africa-Common eland |publisher=Wackywildlifewonders.com |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

They live on home ranges that can be 174<U+2013>422&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for females and [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] and 21<U+2013>75&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for males, but in the dry season the home ranges reduce to 9<U+2013>58&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and 1<U+2013>39&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for females and males respectively. Sometimes the home ranges of males overlap when the females are in [[estrus]], that is, the phase when the female is sexually receptive.

==Diet==
[[File:Elands Thoiry 19802.jpg|thumb|right|Elands are mainly grazers.]]
Common elands are [[herbivore]]s which [[Browsing (herbivory)|browse]] during drier winter months but have also adapted to [[grazing]] during the rainy season when grasses are more common.<ref name = Pappas/>  They require a high-[[protein]] diet of [[succulent plant|succulent]] leaves of [[flowering plant]]s but will consume lower quality plant material if available including [[forb]]s, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers.<ref name = Pappas/><ref name="seaworld1"/><ref name="thinkquest1">{{cite web | url = http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/wildlife/common_eland.shtml | title = The Living Africa: Wildlife <U+2013> Bovid Family <U+2013> Common Eland | publisher = Library.thinkquest.org | date= | accessdate = 2012-04-09 }}</ref><ref name = "adw"/>  Most of their water is obtained from their food, though they will drink water when available.<ref name = Pappas/>  Elands will use their horns to break off branches they cannot reach with their mouths.<ref name=rafferty>{{cite book | editor = Rafferty JP | title = Grazers | year = 2010 | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-61530-465-3 | edition=1st | pages = [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=m-zX8zBKogAC&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false 77<U+2013>78] | chapter = Elands, Antelopes}}</ref>

==Sociability and reproduction==

[[File:Aa knowsley 2elandsfighting.jpg|thumb|right|Two male elands fighting over [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]], [[Knowsley Safari Park]], 9 September 2009]]
Females are [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at 15<U+2013>36 months and males at 4<U+2013>5 years. [[Mating]] may occur anytime after reaching sexual maturity, and is especially observed during the rainy season. In [[Zambia]] young are born in July and August, a distinct breeding season.<ref name="adw"/> This is due to elands gathering to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, in which some males and females start mating with each other in separate groups. Males chase the females in order to know if they is in [[estrus]] by testing their urine. Usually a female chooses the most dominant and fittest male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2<U+2013>4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period.<ref name="thinkquest1"/> The dominant male can mate with more than one female.<ref name="adw"/> Females have a [[gestation]] period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.<ref name=uu>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Taurotragus_oryx.html |title=Taurotragus oryx (Common eland)-Ontogeny and Reproduction |publisher=Ultimateungulate.com |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

The elands form three different social groups, namely that of males, females and juveniles. The male group is the smallest one, with the members living close to each other and sticking firmly to a particular food or water source. Male groups are always roaming and not stable. Secondly, the female group is much larger in size and covers greater areas.<ref name="adw"/> They travel around the [[plain]]s full of grass in wet periods and during dry periods prefer bushy areas. In an experiment it was found that females have a complex [[linear hierarchy]]. It is often thought that it is the mother which determines a female's [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]]. Thirdly there is the nursery and juveniles group, which is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. In no more than 24 hours the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they are at least two years old and join a male or female group according to their sex.<ref name="uu"/>

==Conservation==
[[File:Taurotragus.oryx-01-Krakow.jpg|thumb|left|Common eland in a zoo in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], [[Poland]].]]
Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and regulated in international trade by the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]].<ref name=antelope>{{cite web|title=Common Eland|url=http://www.antelopetag.com/assets/docs/Antelope/Common_Eland.pdf}}</ref>  Using ground counts and [[aerial survey]]s, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000.<ref name = IUCN>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22055/0 |title=Population of common elands |publisher=Iucnredlist.org |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>  Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]], [[Malawi]] and possibly [[Tanzania]].  

The population is gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, caused by expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat.<ref name=pdf3>{{cite book|last=East|first=compiled by R.|title=West and Central Africa.|year=1990|publisher=IUCN|location=Gland|isbn=2-8317-0016-7|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=n22ER5vZqTkC&pg=PA131&dq=common+eland&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yMJqT7THDtDKrAf227WhAg&ved=0CFoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=common%20eland&f=false|page=131|format=PDF|chapter=Common Eland (''Tragelaphus oryx'')}}</ref>  As they are docile and inactive most of the time they can easily be killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/mammalia/artiodactyla/common-eland.htm#ec |title=Ecology and conservation of the eland |publisher=Seaworld.org |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref> The species became extinct in [[Swaziland]], but has been reintroduced.<ref name="wilson"/>

The IUCN states that about half of the estimated total population occurs in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include [[Omo National Park|Omo]] ([[Ethiopia]]), [[Serengeti]], Katavi, [[Ruaha]] and Selous-Kilombero ([[Tanzania]]), [[Kafue]] and North Luangwa ([[Zambia]]), [[Nyika Plateau|Nyika]] ([[Malawi]]), [[Etosha]] ([[Namibia]]), [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park]] ([[Botswana]]/[[South Africa]]) and [[Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park]] ([[South Africa]]). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now occur on private land, particularly in [[Namibia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]], reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] and [[Kenya]], as well as in [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/22055/0 |title=Conservation status (least concern) |publisher=Iucnredlist.org |date= |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=consv>{{cite book|last=East|first=comp. by Rod|title=African antelope database 1998|year=1999|publisher=The IUCN Species Survival Commission|location=Gland, Switzerland|isbn=2-8317-0477-4|coauthors=Group, the IUCN/SSC Antelope Specialist|page=139|format=PDF|chapter=Common Eland (Conservation status)}}</ref>

==Uses==
[[File:Skinningeland.png|thumb|A common eland being [[skinning|skinned]] for its rich leather in [[England]].]]
[[File:Wappen Grootfontein - Namibia.jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Coat of arms of [[Grootfontein]], [[Namibia]].]]
Common eland are sometimes farmed and/or hunted for their meat, and in some cases can be better utilized than cattle due to their being more suited to their natural habitat. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from [[cattle]] to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the logo of the [[coat of arms]] of [[Grootfontein]], [[Namibia]].

===Husbandry===
Common elands have a mild [[temperament]] and have been successfully [[Domestication|domesticated]] for meat and milk production in [[South Africa]] and [[Russia]].<ref name="rafferty"/>  Their need for water is quite low (they produce [[urine]] with a high-[[urea]] content) but they require a substantial grazing area, [[Mineral lick|salt licks]] and large amounts of supplementary foods like [[maize]], [[sorghum]]s, [[melon]]s and [[bean]]s which can be expensive.  A female can produce up to {{convert|7|kg|lbs}} of milk per day that is richer in [[milkfat]] than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a [[butterfat]] content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared (versus several days for cow milk).<ref name=Pappas/>  

Housing common elands is difficult due to their ability to jump over fences as tall as {{convert|3|m}} or simply break through using their substantial mass. Sometimes wild eland will break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones.  Common eland can reproduce in captivity, but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding.<ref name = Pappas/>  [[Animal husbandry|Husbandry]] requires care as while eland are generally not aggressive, they startle easily and require large amounts of space.<ref name=Harris/>
