'''Idi Amin Dada''' (mid-1920s<ref name=birth_date_place>Many sources hold that Amin was born in Koboko or Kampala, circa 1925, and that the exact date of his birth is unknown ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007180 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica] [http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551632/Amin_Idi.html Encarta], [http://www.bartleby.com/65/am/Amin-Idi.html Columbia Encyclopedia]). According to researcher Fred Guweddeko, Amin was born on [[17 May]] [[1928]],[http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/special_adi-amin-profile/Rejected_then_taken_in_by_dad_a_timeline_2.shtml] but that is also disputed.[http://www.mail-archive.com/ugandanet@kym.net/msg06472.html]. Upon his death, medical officials said Amin had died at the age of 80, which would make his year of birth 1923.

Amin joined the [[British colony|British colonial]] regiment, the [[King's African Rifles]], in 1946, and advanced to the rank of [[Major General]] and [[Commander]] of the Ugandan Army. He took power in a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'<U+00E9>tat|military coup]] in January 1971, deposing [[Milton Obote]]. His rule was characterized by [[human rights]] abuses, [[political repression]], [[ethnic persecution]], [[Extrajudicial punishment|extra-judicial killing]]s and the [[Expulsion of Indians in Uganda in 1972|expulsion of Indians from Uganda]]. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is unknown; estimates range from 80,000 to 500,000.<ref name="guardian_obit">"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1020657,00.html Obituary: Idi Amin]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[2003-08-18]].</ref>

Dissent within Uganda, and Amin's attempt to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Kagera]] province of [[Tanzania]] in 1978, led to the [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] and the fall of his regime in 1979.

==Early life and military career==
Amin never wrote an autobiography or authorized any official account of his life. There are discrepancies as to when and where he was born. Most biographical sources hold that he was born in either [[Koboko District|Koboko]] or [[Kampala]] around 1925.<ref name="britannica">"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007180 Idi Amin]", ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica''</ref> According to Fred Guweddeko, a researcher at [[Makerere University]], Idi Amin was the son of Andreas Nyabire (1889<U+2013>1976). Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa]] ethnic group, converted from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. Abandoned by his father, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was called Assa Aatte (1904<U+2013>1970), an ethnic [[Lugbara]] and a traditional [[herbalist]], who treated members of [[Buganda]] royalty, among others. Amin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941, where he excelled in reciting the [[Qur'an]]. After a few years he left school and did odd jobs before being recruited to the army by a British colonial army officer.<ref name="monitor_01012004">"[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/index.php Rejected then taken in by dad; a timeline]", ''[[The Monitor]]'', [[March 1]], [[2004]].</ref>

===Colonial British army=== 
Amin joined the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) of the [[History of the British Army|British Colonial Army]] in 1946 as an assistant cook.<ref name="britannica"/> He claimed he was forced to join the Army during [[World War II]] and that he served in the [[Burma Campaign]],<ref>{{cite video|publisher = Le Figaro Films| title = General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait|year2=1974|ISBN=0-78002-507-5}}</ref> but records indicate he was first enlisted after the war was concluded.<ref name="guardian_obit"/><ref>[http://www.strategypage.com/on_point/20030820.aspx Why Didn't Amin Rot and Die in Jail?], ''Strategy Page'', August 20, 2003</ref> He was transferred to Kenya for infantry service as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in 1947 and served in the 21st KAR infantry brigade in [[Gilgil, Kenya|Gilgil]], [[Kenya]], until 1949. That year, his unit was deployed to [[Somalia]] to fight the Somali [[Shifta]] rebels who were [[cattle raiding|rustling cattle]] there.<ref name="ContWldHist">Jan Palmowski, ''Dictionary of Contemporary World History: From 1900 to the present day. Second Edition'', Oxford University Press, 2003 (ISBN 0-19-860539-0)</ref> It is rumored that Amin got his third name 'Dada' from Kenya which he later adapted; it is said that during one of their end of year parties, Amin managed to 'smuggle' his girlfriend into the barracks. However, on being caught red-handed with her, he claimed that she was his sister. In Kiswahili, 'dada' means sister. So his colleagues gave him that nickname which later became his third name. In 1952 his battalion was deployed against the [[Mau Mau]] rebels in Kenya. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in 1953.<ref name="monitor_01012004">"[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/index.php Rejected then taken in by dad; a timeline]", ''[[The Monitor]]'', 2004-03-01</ref>.  

In 1954 Amin was made ''[[effendi]]'' ([[Warrant officer]]), the highest rank possible for a [[Black people|Black African]] in the colonial British army of that time. Amin returned to Uganda the same year, and in 1961 he was promoted to [[lieutenant]], becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]]. He was then assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda's [[Karamojong]] and Kenya's [[Turkana]] [[nomad]]s. In 1962 he was promoted to captain and then, in 1963, to [[major]]. The following year, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army.<ref name="monitor_01012004"/> 

Amin was an active athlete during his time in the army. At 193 cm (6 ft 4 in), he was the Ugandan [[light heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion from 1951 to 1960, and a swimmer and rugby player.<ref name=Scotsman>[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=972&id=906002003 Idi Amin], ''Scotsman'', August 16, 2003</ref><ref>[http://www.ugpulse.com/articles/daily/print.asp?ID=450 Idi Amin Dada: A Hero in Ugandan Sports?]</ref>

===Army commander===
In 1965 [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]] [[Milton Obote]] and Amin were implicated in a deal to smuggle [[ivory]] and [[gold]] into Uganda from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an associate of the former Congolese leader [[Patrice Lumumba]], was part of an arrangement to help troops opposed to the Congolese government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. In 1966, [[Parliament]] demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by ''[[Kabaka]]'' (King) [[Edward Mutesa II]] of [[Buganda]], and declared himself executive president. He promoted Amin to [[colonel]] and army commander. Amin led [[Battle of Mengo Hill|an attack]] on the ''Kabaka's'' palace and forced Mutesa into [[exile]] to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies: Uganda.

Amin began recruiting members of [[Kakwa]], [[Lugbara]], [[Nubian]], and other ethnic groups from the [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile]] area bordering [[Sudan]]. The Nubians had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from Sudan to serve the colonial army. In Uganda, Nubians were commonly perceived as Sudanese foreigners and erroneously referred to as [[Anyanya]] (Anyanya were southern Sudanese rebels of the [[First Sudanese Civil War]] and were not involved in Uganda). Because many ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and Sudan, allegations persist that Amin's army consisted substantially of Sudanese soldiers.<ref name="Anyanya">Nantulya Paul, [http://www.kas.org.za/Publications/SeminarReports/PoliticsofIdentityandExclusion/nantulya.pdf#search=%22%22idi%20amin%22%20anyanya%22 ''Exclusion, Identity and Armed Conflict: A Historical Survey of the Politics of Confrontation in Uganda with Specific Reference to the Independence Era''], (2001) Konrad Adenauer Stiftung</ref>

==Seizure of power==
[[Image:Amin takes oath.jpg||thumb|right|270px|Amin at the [[February 2]], [[1971]] presidential swearing-in ceremony.]]
Eventually, a rift developed between Amin and Obote, worsened by the support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the [[First Sudanese Civil War|rebellion in southern Sudan]], and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote himself took control of the armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.<ref name=britishcouncil>[http://www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish-central-history-amin.htm British Council: General Idi Amin overthrows Ugandan government ([[February 2]], [[1971]])]</ref> 

Amin learned that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds and seized power in a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'<U+00E9>tat|military coup]] on [[January 25]], [[1971]], while Obote was attending a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] summit meeting in [[Singapore]]. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off [[Entebbe International Airport]], the main artery into Uganda, and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on [[Uganda Broadcasting Corporation|Radio Uganda]] accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the [[Lango sub-region|Lango region]]. Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/25/newsid_2506000/2506423.stm Idi Amin ousts Ugandan president], ''BBC'', January 25, 1971</ref> Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the [[military government]] would remain only as a [[caretaker government|caretaker regime]] until new elections, which would be announced as soon as the situation was normalised. He promised to release all [[political prisoner]]s.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,,1004256,00.html Curfew in Uganda after military coup topples Obote], ''The Guardian'', January 26, 1971</ref> 

Amin was initially welcomed both within Uganda and by the international community. In an internal memo, the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Foreign Office]] described him as "a splendid type and a good [[Football (soccer)|football]] player".<ref>Bryan Appleyard, [[The Sunday Times]], [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,14931-2529504,00.html ''A wolf in sheep<U+2019>s clothing''], January 7, 2007.

==Presidency==
{{Main|Uganda under Idi Amin}}

===Establishment of military rule===
On [[February 2]], [[1971]], one week after the coup, Amin declared himself President of Uganda, [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces, Army [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] and Chief of Air Staff. He announced that he was suspending certain provisions of the [[Constitution of Uganda|constitution]] and soon instituted an Advisory Defence Council composed of military officers, with himself as the chairman. Amin placed [[military tribunal]]s above the system of [[civil law]], appointed soldiers to top government posts and [[parastatal]] agencies, and informed the newly inducted civilian [[cabinet|cabinet ministers]] that they would be subject to [[Military courtesy|military discipline]].<ref name=britishcouncil/><ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin>Library of Congress Country Studies: Uganda. [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html#ug0159 Military Rule Under Amin]</ref> Amin renamed the presidential lodge in Kampala from Government House to "The Command Post". He disbanded the General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, and replaced it with the State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at the Kampala surburb of Nakasero became the scene of torture and executions over the next several years.<ref name=LOC_Security>Library of Congress Country Studies: Uganda. [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html#ug0159 Uganda: Post-Independence Security Services]</ref> Other agencies used to root out political dissent included the [[military police]] and the Public Safety Unit (PSU).<ref name=LOC_Security/> 

Obote took refuge in Tanzania, having been offered sanctuary there by Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. He was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing Amin. In 1972, the exiles attempted to regain the country through a poorly organized coup attempt, without success.<ref name=invasion>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946151-1,00.html An Idi-otic Invasion]", ''Time Magazine'', November 13, 1978</ref>

===Persecution of ethnic and other groups===
[[Image:Luwum and Amin.jpg||thumb|right|270px|Amin with Archbishop [[Janani Luwum]] (right). The archbishop was later murdered.]]
Amin retaliated against the attempted invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972 by purging the army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the [[Acholi]] and [[Lango]] ethnic groups.<ref name=AboutBio>"[http://africanhistory.about.com/od/biography/a/bio_amin.htm Biography: Idi Amin Dada]," About.com</ref> In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] and [[Mbarara]] [[Barracks]],<ref>Sue Lautze, ''[http://www.livesandlivelihoods.com/files/25826548.pdf Research on Violent Institutions in Unstable Environments: The livelihoods systems of Ugandan army soldiers and their families in a war zone]'', Hertford College, Oxford University1</ref> and by early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and at least twice as many civilians, had disappeared.<ref name=telegraph_obituary>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/08/18/db1801.xml&page=1 Obituary: Idi Amin], ''Daily Telegraph'', 17 September, 2003.</ref> The victims soon came to include members of other [[ethnic groups]], religious leaders, journalists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals.

The killings, motivated by ethnic, political and financial factors, continued throughout Amin's eight-year reign.<ref name=telegraph_obituary/> The exact number of people killed is unknown. The [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated the death toll at no fewer than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. An estimate compiled by exile organizations with the help of [[Amnesty International]] puts the number killed at 500,000.<ref name=guardian_obit/> Among the most prominent people killed were: [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]], the former [[Prime Minister of Uganda|prime minister]] and later [[chief justice]]; [[Janani Luwum]], the [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] [[archbishop]]; [[Joseph Mubiru]], the former governor of [[Bank of Uganda|the Central Bank]]; Frank Kalimuzo, the vice chancellor of [[Makerere University]]; Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright; and two of Amin's own cabinet ministers, [[Erinayo Wilson Oryema]] and [[Charles Oboth Ofumbi]].<ref>"[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin6.php Who were Amin's victims?]", ''Monitor'' Special report</ref>

In 1977, [[Henry Kyemba]], Amin's health minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, [[defection|defected]] and resettled in Britain. Kyemba wrote and published ''A State of Blood'', the first insider expos<U+00E9> of Amin's rule.

In August 1972, Idi Amin declared what he called an "economic war", a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly [[India]]ns born in the country, whose ancestors had come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony. Many owned businesses, including large-scale enterprises, that formed the backbone of the Ugandan economy. On [[August 4]], [[1972]], Amin issued a decree ordering the [[expulsion of Indians in Uganda in 1972|expulsion]] of the 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens (most of them held [[British passport]]s). This was later amended to include all 80,000 Asians, with the exception of professionals, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers. Most of the Asians with British passports, around 30,000, emigrated to Britain. Others went to [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States|U.S.]]<ref>[http://www.ugandamission.net/aboutug/articles/amin.html Amin's Economic War Left Uganda on Crutches], ''New Vision'', July 29, 2003</ref><ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm 1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda]", August 7, 2006.

The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.<ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/>

===International relations===
{{Further|[[Foreign relations of Uganda]]}}
Following the expulsion of Indians in 1972, [[India]] severed diplomatic relations with Uganda. The [[government of India|Indian government]] warned Uganda of dire consequences, but took no actions when Amin's government ignored the ultimatum. The same year, as part of his "economic war", Amin broke diplomatic ties with Britain and [[nationalization|nationalized]] 85 British-owned businesses. He also expelled [[Israel]]i military advisers and turned to [[Muammar al-Qaddafi]] of [[Libya]] and the [[Soviet Union]] for support.<ref name=AboutBio/>

In 1973, U.S. Ambassador [[Thomas Patrick Melady]] recommended that the United States reduce its presence in Uganda. Melady described Amin's regime as "[[racism|racist]], erratic and unpredictable, brutal, inept, bellicose, irrational, ridiculous, and [[militarism|militaristic]]".<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/nixon/e6/66834.htm Telegram 1 From the Embassy in Uganda to the Department of State, January 2, 1973]</ref> Accordingly, the United States closed its embassy in [[Kampala]].

In June 1976, Idi Amin allowed an [[Air France]] aeroplane hijacked by two members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations]] (PFLP-EO) and two members of the [[Germany|German]] [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|Revolution<U+00E4>re Zellen]] to land at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]]. There, the hijackers were joined by three more. Soon after, 156 hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them, continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularily known as [[Operation Entebbe]]), nearly all of the hostages were freed. Three hostages died and 10 were wounded; six hijackers, 45 Ugandan soldiers, and one Israeli soldier, [[Yoni Netanyahu]], were killed. This incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading Britain to close its [[High Commissioner|High Commission]] in Uganda.<ref>BBC on July 7, 1976.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/7/newsid_2496000/2496095.stm British grandmother missing in Uganda]</ref>

Uganda under Amin embarked on a large military build-up, which raised concerns in [[Kenya]]. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-made arms en route to Uganda at the port of [[Mombasa]]. Tension between Uganda and Kenya reached its climax in February 1976 when Amin announced that he would investigate the possibility that parts of [[southern Sudan]] and western and central Kenya, up to within 32 km of [[Nairobi]], were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The [[Politics of Kenya|Kenyan Government]] responded with a stern statement that Kenya would not part with "a single inch of territory". Amin backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and [[armored personnel carrier]]s along the Kenya-Uganda border.<ref>[http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/17082003/News/Amin_News170820039.html 'Dada' always rubbed Kenya the wrong way]", ''Sunday Nation'', [[August 17]], [[2003]].</ref>

== Erratic behaviour ==
As the years went on, Amin became increasingly erratic and outspoken. In 1977, after Britain had broken diplomatic relations with his regime, Amin declared he had beaten the British and conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). Radio Uganda then read out the whole of his new title: "''[[Excellency|His Excellency]] [[President for Life]], [[Field Marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Juris Doctor|Doctor]]<ref name=doctorate/> Idi Amin Dada, VC,<ref>The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]] [http://www.ganews.co.uk/archive/antiques0404.html]</ref> [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], CBE.''".<ref name="guardian_obit"/> In 1971, Amin and [[Zaire]]'s president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] changed the names of [[Lake Albert]] and [[Lake Edward]] to Lake Mobutu Sese Seko and Lake Idi Amin Dada, respectively.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906577,00.html Purges and Peace Talks], ''Time'' [[October 16]], [[1972]].</ref> 

Foreign journalists considered Amin a somewhat comical, eccentric figure. In 1977, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called him a "killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet".<ref name=time>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918762-1,00.html "Amin:The Wild Man of Africa"], ''Time Magazine'', [[February 28]], [[1977]]</ref> Amin became the subject of rumours and myths, including a widespread belief that he was a [[cannibalism|cannibal]]. Some of the unsubstantiated rumours, such as the mutilation of one of his wives, were spread and popularised by the 1980 film, ''[[Rise and Fall of Idi Amin]]''.<ref>"[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin9.php The myths surrounding Idi Amin]", Moses Serugo, ''The Monitor'' Special report</ref>

==Deposition and exile== 
{{Further|[[Uganda-Tanzania War]]}}
By 1978, the number of Amin's close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from within Uganda. After the killings of Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled to exile.<ref name=bishop>[http://www.ugandaobserver.com/new/archives/2006arch/features/spec/feb/spec200602161.php "Not even an archbishop was spared"], ''The Weekly Observer'', [[February 16]], [[2006]]</ref> Later that year, after Amin's vice president, General [[Mustafa Adrisi]], was injured in a car accident, troops loyal to him [[mutiny|mutinied]]. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border.<ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/> Amin accused Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of [[Tanzania]]n territory, and formally [[annexation|annexed]] a section of the [[Kagera Region]] across the boundary.<ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/><ref name=invasion/>

Nyerere mobilized the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] and counterattacked, joined by several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and despite military help from [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], he was forced to flee on [[April 11]], [[1979]] when [[The liberation of Kampala|Kampala was captured]]. He escaped first to Libya and ultimately settled in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=britannica/> 

Amin held that Uganda needed him and never expressed [[remorse]] for the abuses of his regime.<ref name=remorse>Riccardo Orizio, ''Talk of the Devil: Encounters with Seven Dictators'', Walker & Company, 2004 (ISBN 0-8027-7692-2)</ref> In 1989, he attempted to return to Uganda, apparently to lead an armed group organised by Colonel [[Juma Oris]]. He reached [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), before Zairian President [[Mobutu]] forced him to return to Saudi Arabia.

On [[July 20]], [[2003]], one of Idi Amin's wives, Madina, reported that he was in a [[coma]] and near death at [[King Faisal Specialist Hospital]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. She pleaded with Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] to allow him to return to die in Uganda. Museveni replied that Amin would have to "answer for his [[sin]]s the moment he was brought back."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3093613.stm Idi Amin back in media spotlight]", ''BBC'', 25 July, 2003</ref> Idi Amin died in Saudi Arabia on [[August 16]], [[2003]].

==Family and associates==
A [[polygamy|polygamist]], Idi Amin married at least five women, three of whom he [[divorce]]d. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. The next year, he married Nora and then Nalongo Madina in 1972. On [[March 26]], [[1974]], he announced on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Nora and Kay.<ref name=life_and_loves>[http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/20082003/News/News122.html The life and loves of a tyrant], ''Daily Nation'', [[August 20]], [[2003]]</ref><ref>[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin8.php Big Daddy and his women], ''The Monitor'' Special Report</ref> Malyamu was arrested in [[Tororo]] on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya.

Her body was found [[dismemberment|dismembered]]. In August 1975, during the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) summit meeting in Kampala, Amin married Sarah Kyolaba. Sarah's boyfriend, whom she was living with before she met Amin, vanished and was never heard from again. According to ''The Monitor'', Amin married a seventh wife a few months before his death in 2003.<ref name=Amin_is_dead/>

Sources differ widely on the number of children Amin fathered; most say that he had 30 to 45.<ref>According to Henry Kyema, in ''State of Blood'' (published in 1977), Idi Amin had 34 children. Some sources say Amin claimed to have fathered 32 children.[http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1020657,00.html]. A report in ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)]]'' says he was survived by 45 children.[http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/news1.php], while another in the BBC gives the figure of 54[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3179085.stm].</ref> Until 2003, Taban Amin, Idi Amin's eldest son, was the leader of [[West Nile Bank Front]] (WNBF), a rebel group opposed to the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]].

Among Amin's closest associates were the British-born [[Bob Astles]], who is considered by many to have been a malign influence, and by others as a moderating presence.<ref>[http://www.rhodesia.com/oz_wa/bt1998/aprmay.htm#wobbly Dictator's 'white rat' now a Wimbledon wobbly], ''Bundu Times'', April - May 1998</ref> [[Isaac Malyamungu]] was an instrumental affiliate and one of the more feared officers in Amin's army.<ref name=bishop/>
