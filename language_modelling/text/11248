'''F<U+00E9>lix Delahaye''' (1767<U+2013>1829)  (surname also spelled de Lahaie, Delahaie, de Lahaye) was a French gardener who served on the [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] voyage (1791<U+2013>93) that was sent by the French [[National Assembly]] to search for the missing explorer [[La P<U+00E9>rouse]].

Delahaye was one of several gardener-botanists employed on European colonial voyages of exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the [[naturalist]]s on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants and seed, as well as plant specimens for [[herbarium]] collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist [[Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardi<U+00E8>re]]<U+2014>who accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections of that era and published what was, in effect, the first [[Flora]] of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.

On returning to France Delahaye eventually became Head Gardener to [[Empress Josephine]] at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Malmaison]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Jardin des plantes.jpg|thumb|250px|<center>Plan of the [[Jardin des Plantes]], Paris, in 1820. Delahaye joined the staff in 1788 aged 20 as a young gardener and was eventually promoted to the position of Director of Horticulture<center>]]
F<U+00E9>lix Delahaye was the son of Normandy labourer Abraham Delahaye and his wife Marie-Anne-<U+00C9>lisabeth Sapeigne who lived in the village of Caumont (Seine-Maritime) about 20 kilometres from Le Havre. At the age of 17 he left his parents<U+2019> farm and was employed as an apprentice gardener at the botanical garden of the [[Academie des Sciences]] in Rouen, historic capital of Normandy, under the direction of a Monsieur Varin. Just before the [[French Revolution]] in 1788, at the age of 20, he commenced work with [[Andr<U+00E9> Thouin]] at the [[Jardin du Roi]] in Paris as a junior gardener, rising through the ranks to become Director of Horticulture at the city's new school of horticulture (Ecole Nationale d<U+2019>Horticulture).<ref name ="Hamilton 1998 8">{{Harvnb|Hamilton|1998|p=8}}</ref> His mentor, Thouin, was professor of horticulture in the Botany School of the [[Jardin du Roi]]. After the French Revolution this garden assumed its present name, the [[Jardin des Plantes]]. Thouin was also treasurer to the prestigious [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> d<U+2019>Histoire Naturelle]] and is commemorated by the name Thoin Bay in Tasmania.

==Bruni d<U+2019>Entrecasteaux expedition==
{{Main|Bruni d'Entrecasteaux}}
The La P<U+00E9>rouse's expedition was last seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in [[New Holland]], Australia. It had been observed by ships of the [[First Fleet]] of convicts from England under the command of [[Arthur Phillip]] who was just leaving for [[Port Jackson]] after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement.<ref name="Duyker 2003 73">{{Harvnb|Duyker|2003|p=73}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=4}}</ref> In 1791 France<U+2019>s National Assembly decided to send out a search mission lead by Bruni d<U+2019>Entrecasteaux. With Thouin<U+2019>s recommendation Delahaye was invited to join the expedition's team of "savants" (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as <U+201C> ... ''strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi''.<U+201D><ref>{{Harvnb|cited in Duyker|2005|p=5}}</ref> Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the [[Louis d'or]]), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment.<ref name="Duyker 2005 5"/> As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus and to read and write in French.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2003|p=95}}</ref> His reading included [[Jean Baptiste Fran<U+00E7>ois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]]<U+2019>s ''Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique'' (1783) and the works of [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] (1700<U+2013>1782) who published works on forestry, naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=6}}</ref> Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit tree nuts, one containing gardening tools and another gardener<U+2019>s clothing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mulvaney |2006 ch. 1}}</ref>

===Landfalls===
The expedition consisted of two [[frigate]]s, [[French ship Recherche (1787)|''Recherche'']] and ''[[Esp<U+00E9>rance]]''. Thefirst landfall was the Canary Islands, then the Cape of Good Hope followed by Van Diemen<U+2019>s Land (in [[Recherche Bay]], Tasmania, named byD'Entrecasteaux after his expedition flagship), then New Caledonia, Admiralty Islands, the Dutch colony of Ambon (where Delahaye exchanged seeds with the Dutch governor) then to south-western Australia discovering and naming Esperance Bay (D'Entrecasteaux now commemorating his second ship). With water running low the ships then returned to the safety of Recherche Bay, thus completing a counterclockwise circumnavigation of the continent. The next destination was Tonga where Delahaye collected [[breadfruit]] for transport to the Isle de France (Mauritius), then to New Caledonia (where [[Kermadec]], captain of the ''Esp<U+00E9>rance'' died), past Vanikoro Island (unaware that this is where La P<U+00E9>rouse had been shipwrecked) then through the Solomons, Trobriand Islands and finally, just before the death of d<U+2019>Entrecasteaux in July 1793 from [[scurvy]], surveyed the coasts of eastern New Guinea and northern New Britain. The expedition was now under the new command of [[d<U+2019>Auribeau]] the ships arriving at Sourabaya, Java, in 1793, to be told that France was now at war with European countries including Holland, Britain and Spain, also that Louis XVI had been guillotined and a French republic was now declared. The Dutch seized the ships. With one exception all the savants appeared to have revolutionary sympathies.<ref name="Duyker 2005 5">{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=5}}</ref> They were interned at Semerang and the scientific collections confiscated to be eventually captured later by the British from a French ship returning them to France. Under the benign auspices of [[Joseph Banks]], these were returned to France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|pp=11<U+2013>14}}</ref> Delahaye was not, like Labillardiere, interned at Semerang but was permitted to tend the breadfruit trees destined for the Ile de France.<ref name="FM">{{Harvnb|Steenis & Steenis-Kruseman|1974|p=307}}</ref> In the course of the expedition, and under the guidance of Labillardi<U+00E8>re, Delahaye had made a numbered collection of 2,699 dried plant specimens as well as many collections of seed.<ref name="Duyker 2003 73"/>

===A European vegetable garden===
{{Main|Recherche Bay}}
[[Image:Recherche Bay near Cockle creek.jpg|thumb|450px|right|<center>The safe haven [[Recherche Bay]] named by [[D'Entrecasteaux]] after one of his vessels</center>]]
In 1792 over the 25 days of the first landfall in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was as a source of food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=8}}</ref> This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by [[Jane Griffin (Lady Franklin)|Lady Jane Franklin]] in the 1840s.<ref name="RB">[http://www.recherchebay.org/campaign/draftNomination.PDF Draft nomination of Recherche Bay for the Tasmanian Heritage Register]</ref> Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman [[William Bligh]]'s expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener [[David Nelson]]. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow.<ref>{{Harvnb|cited in Mulvaney ch. 4|2007}}</ref> Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=9}}</ref> Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh<U+2019>s expedition in 1792.<ref name="Duyker 2005 12">{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=12}}</ref>

===Rediscovery of garden in 2003===
On 4 February 2003, situated in the north-eastern peninsula of Recherche Bay, environmental activists Helen Gee and Bob Graham found moss-covered stones forming a rectangle roughly 9m x 7.7m subdivided into four rectangles and enclosing a <U+201C>plinth<U+201D> (to support barrels of water) measuring 1.8m x 1.7m. This was almost certainly the remains of the garden established by Delahaye in 1792. The site ("NE peninsula") was placed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register on 20 February 2003.<ref>{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=3}}</ref>  This discovery was an important element in a protracted campaign to preserve the site and, indeed, the whole peninsula, which was then in private ownership, and under threat of being logged.

==Transporting breadfruit to the French West Indies==
[[Image:Artocarpus altilis (fruit).jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>[[Breadfruit]], ''Artocarpus altilis'' (fruit)</center>]]
{{Main|Breadfruit}}
After several weeks of productive botanising in Recherche Bay, in 1793 the expedition ships set sail for Tonga where Delahaye had specific instructions to collect quality breadfruit plants for transport to the Ile de France. The plants he selected were maintained in specially designed rectangular wooden chests with drainage holes and a frame that would hold glass or grills to assist temperature regulation.<ref name="Duyker 2005 12"/> Accordingly, in Tonga he collected 200 breadfruit plants, emulating similar work of David Nelson, gardener-botanist to British Captain Bligh on the Bounty. By the time the French reached Sourabaya in Java only 14 plants survived and this was reduced to 10 when Delahaye moved to Semarang about another 300 kilometres away. By careful care and [[layering]] (a means of propagation) he managed to double the number of plants before leaving Java in January 1797.<ref>{{Harvnb|cited in Mulvaney ch. 9|2007}}</ref>  He then cared for the plants at sea eventually delivering them to [[Jean Nicolas C<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>]] at the [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden |Jardin des Pamplemousses]] on the Ile de France. Here they prospered under his care until he returned to France. Thanks to Delahaye<U+2019>s careful husbandry the breadfruit was subsequently successfully introduced to the French West Indies. Between March and April 1797 on the Isle de France he had collected 280 separately numbered plant specimens and these were added to his specimens and seed collected in Java and seed collected in Australia.<ref name ="Duyker 2005 13-14">{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|pp=13<U+2013>14}}</ref>

When the collections from th expedition were finally returned to Paris they filled 36 trunks<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamilton|1998|p=56}}</ref> and among the living plants brought back were two breadfruit trees.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brosse|1983|p=91}}</ref>

==Subsequent work==
{{Main|Ch<U+00E2>teau de Malmaison}}
Delahaye had departed Mauritius in May 1797, arriving in France and on 9 July to be appointed as an official on a commission sent to Italy to plunder the libraries and museums of northern Italy in the wake of Napoleon<U+2019>s victories there.<ref name ="Duyker 2005 13-14"/> On his return he was appointed head gardener, first at [[Trianon]] in 1798 and then, in 1805, on the Empress Jos<U+00E9>phine<U+2019>s estate at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Malmaison|Malmaison]]. An Englishman, Alexander Howatson, had been appointed Head Gardener at Malmaison. Napoleon did not like having an Englishman as an employee and being presented with an excessive bill by Howatson for transportation of shrubs to Malmaison, Napoleon had an opportunity to dispense with his services. The post of Superintendent of the Ch<U+00E2>teau de Malmaison gardens was given to the botanist [[Charles-Fran<U+00E7>ois Brisseau de Mirbel|Charles de Mirbel]]. It was through de Mirbel that Delahaye had obtained the position of Head Gardener at Malmaison, based on his successful restoration of the gardens at Le Trianon and and also Marie Antoinette's old garden at Versailles. This garden was probably the most important collection of living Australian plants in Europe in this period.<ref name="RB"/> For several decades Delahaye was the only gardener in Europe who had actually seen the plants from New Holland growing in their natural habitat, and many of the plants he grew he had collected himself.<ref name ="Hamilton 1998 8"/> Although tensions developed between Delahaye and Empress Josephine's chief botanist, [[Aim<U+00E9> Bonpland]], Delahaye continued to work for Empress Jos<U+00E9>phine until her death in 1814 after which he entered business (possibly in 1826 when Malmaison was sold<ref name="FM"/>) as manager of a successful private nursery at Montreuil, near Versailles, which also occupied his wife and sons.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamilton|1998|p=128}}</ref>

Delahaye died at his home, 6 rue Symphorien, Versailles on 20 August 1829, aged 62, and was survived by his wife, Anne Serreaux, two sons and a daughter.<ref name="Duyker 2005 14">{{Harvnb|Duyker|2005|p=14}}</ref>

==Plant collections==
[[File:Grande Gallerie de l'evolution.jpg|thumb|250px|<center>The [[Mus<U+00E9>um national d'Histoire naturelle|Museum National d<U+2019>Histoire Naturelle]], repository of Delahaye's journal and most of his dried plants</center>]]
An extensive collection of living and dried plants was returned to Paris by Delahaye but these were scattered after his death, herbarium specimens now being housed in Paris, Geneva, Mauritius and Java. His original herbarium of 2,699 plants included specimens dated and numbered in his journal as follows: New Ireland (Bismarck Archipelago, Jul 17<U+2013>24 1792, collection numbers 699-786); Ambon (Sept 6 <U+2013> Oct 12, 1792, nos. 787-1113), Boeroe (Sept3<U+2013>5, 1793, nos 1517-1669), Surabaya, East Java (Oct 29 1793<U+2013>Aug 1794, nos 1670-1962), Java (from 1794<U+2013>96, nos 1963-2296), Batavia, west Java (Jun 1796<U+2013>Jan 1797, nos 2297-2419) and the remainder from Ile de France.<ref name="FM"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Guillaumin|1916|pp=356<U+2013>358}}</ref>

On 16 August 1879 the [[Mus<U+00E9>um national d'Histoire naturelle|Museum National d<U+2019>Histoire Naturelle]] purchased his [[herbarium]], 84-folio catalogue and journal from the antiquarian bookseller [[Pironin]] for 295 francs. A small collection of seeds was also donated to the [[Ecole Nationale d<U+2019>Horticulture]] de Versailles by Delahaye<U+2019>s grandson Emile Bertin.<ref name="Duyker 2005 14"/>

==Honours==
The name <U+201C>Lahaie<U+201D> is commemorated on the Li<U+00E9>nard obelisk in the Jardin des Pamplemousses, Mauritius.<ref name ="Duyker 2005 13-14"/> D<U+2019>Entrecasteaux named an island in Port Esp<U+00E9>rance (Tasmania) in Delahaye<U+2019>s honour, but it is now known as Hope Island.<ref name="Duyker 2005 14"/> He was also commemorated by D<U+2019>Entrecasteaux in an islet and a cape in the [[D'Entrecasteaux Islands]].<ref name="FM"/>

==Other gardener-botanists in the Age of Discovery and Enlightenment==
Other gardeners in this tradition include: [[Jean Nicolas Collignon]] on the French La P<U+00E9>rouse expedition to the South Seas, 1785<U+2013>1788, on the flagship ''[[Boussole]]''; [[David Nelson (botanical collector)|David Nelson]] (botanical collector on Cooks Third Voyage, 1776-1779, and on [[William Bligh]]'s ''[[HMS Bounty]]'', 1787<U+2013>1789; [[Peter Good]], assistant to [[Robert Brown]] the botanist on [[Matthew Flinders]]' Voyage to Terra Australis, 1801<U+2013>03; [[Nicolas Baudin]]<U+2019>s scientific expedition to map the coast of Australia, 1800<U+2013>1804, included a small team of gardener-botanists <U+2014> on the flagship ''[[French corvette G<U+00E9>ographe|G<U+00E9>ographe]]'' there was [[Anselme Riedl<U+00E9>]] (the Head Gardener who died on Timor, 21 Oct. 1801), [[Antoine Sautier]] (Assistant Gardener who died at sea 15 Nov 1801) and [[Antoine Guichenot]] (Assistant Gardener who survived to also serve on the 1817 voyage under [[Louis de Freycinet]]) while on the sister ship ''[[French corvette Naturaliste|Naturaliste]]'', 1800<U+2013>1803, commanded by Louis de Freycinet was [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Cagnet]] (left sick on Ile de France) and Merlot (disembarked Ile de France).<ref>{{Harvnb|Brosse|1983|pp=78,85,96,108,196}}</ref>
