The '''radiation effects from the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]''' are the results of release of radioactive isotopes from the crippled [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] after the [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami]]. Radioactive material has been released from the Fukushima containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce gaseous pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, and associated uncontrolled events{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

==Casualties & health effects==

Preliminary dose-estimation reports by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] indicate that 167 plant workers received radiation doses that slightly elevate their risk of developing cancer, but that it may not be statistically detectable.<ref name="Fukushima<U+2019>s doses tallied"/><ref name="who.int"/><ref name="unis.unvienna.org"/> Estimated effective doses from the accident outside of Japan are considered to be below (or far below) the dose levels regarded as very small by the international radiological protection community.<ref name="who.int"/>

According to the Japanese Government, 180,592 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health.<ref>p. 49, no. 6 of {{citation | url = http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110507-1-1.pdf |title = Seismic Damage Information (the 127th Release) | author = Nuclear and Inustrial Safely Agency of Japan | publisher = Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan | date = 23 December 2011 | accessdate =6 June 2012}}</ref>  Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.<ref>p. 42, no. 2 of {{citation | url = http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110423-6-1.pdf |title = Seismic Damage Information (the 110th Release) | author = Nuclear and Inustrial Safely Agency of Japan | publisher = Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan | date = 23 April 2011 | accessdate =26 September 2011}}</ref> 

As of September 2011, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-09-21/us-learns-from-fukushima-nuclear-plant/50501582/1?csp=34news |title=U.S. learns nuclear plant lessons |author=Dan Vergano |date= 21 September 2011|work= USA TODAY }}</ref> Still, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures.

[[Frank N. von Hippel]], a U.S. scientist, has estimated that "on the order of 1,000" people will die from cancer as a result of their exposure to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster{{Verify credibility|failed=y |date=December 2012}}. That is an increase of 0.1 percent in the incidence of cancer, and is much less than the approximately 20,000 people killed directly by the earthquake and tsunami. Because contaminated milk was "interdicted in Japan" the number of (mostly non-fatal) thyroid cancer cases will probably be less than 1 percent of similar cases at Chernobyl. Von Hippel added that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".<ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27<U+2013>36">{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident  |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September/October 2011 vol. 67 no. 5 |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27<U+2013>36 }}</ref>

According to a June 2012 Stanford University study{{Verify credibility|failed=y |date=December 2012}}, the radiation released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan{{Verify credibility|failed=y |date=December 2012}}. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radiation released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radiation release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.<ref name = "stanford"/>

However, that estimate has been challenged, with some scientists arguing that accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/is-nuclear-power-good-for-you.html |author= Dennis Normile |title= Is Nuclear Power Good for You? |journal=Science|pages= 395 |volume= 337 |date= 27 July 2012}}</ref>

The exposure to the radiation "may cause 1,300 deaths globally and 2,500 cases of cancer in Japan."{{Verify credibility|failed=y |date=December 2012}} However, there is a larger issue. The radiation emitted in Fukushima instigated evacuations of <U+201C>16,000 people<U+201D>, which, according to a study, has also caused mental illness and psychological effects on these people. Stress, fatigue and people even being around other seriously ill people are some of the main contributors to the mental health of many of these individuals during the evacuation.

In a leaked TEPCO report dated June 2011, it was revealed that plutonium-238, <U+2212>239, <U+2212>240, and <U+2212>241 were released "to the air" from the site during the first 100&nbsp;hours after the earthquake, the total amount of plutonium said to be 120&nbsp;billion becquerels (120&nbsp;GBq) <U+2014> perhaps as much as 50&nbsp;grams.

===Air releases===
A 12 April report prepared by NISA estimated the total air release of iodine-131 and caesium-137 at between 370&nbsp;[[Becquerel|PBq]] and 630&nbsp;PBq, combining iodine and caesium with IAEA methodology.<ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp">{{cite web |url= http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110412-4.pdf |title=INES Rating on the Events in Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station by the Tohoku District <U+2013> off the Pacific Ocean Earthquake |publisher=NSC |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref> On 23 April the NSC updated its release estimates, but it did not reestimate the total release, instead indicating that 154&nbsp;TBq of air release were occurring daily as of 5&nbsp;April.<ref name="translate.google.com">http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yomiuri.co.jp%2Fscience%2Fnews%2F20110423-OYT1T00667.htm%3Ffrom%3Dmain7&act=url 154 TBq of radioactivity released into the atmosphere per day</ref><ref name="yomiuri.co.jp">http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20110424dy04.htm Atmospheric radiation leak underestimated</ref>

On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan published the results of the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the incident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11&nbsp;March and 5&nbsp;April were revised downwards to 130&nbsp;PBq for iodine-131 (I-131) and 11&nbsp;PBq for caesium-137 (Cs-137). Earlier estimations were 150&nbsp;PBq and 12&nbsp;PBq.<ref>JAIF (5 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315203996P.pdf NSC Recalculates Total Amount of Radioactive Materials Released]</ref>

On 20 September the Japanese government and TEPCO announced the installation of new filters at reactors 1, 2 and 3 to reduce the release of radioactive materials into the air. Gases from the reactors would be decontaminated before they would be released into the air. In the first half of September 2011 the amount of radioactive substances released from the plant was about 200 million becquerels per hour, according to TEPCO, which was approximately one-four millionths of the level of the initial stages of the accident in March.<ref>JAIF (20 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316578041P.pdf Earthquake-report 211: A new plan set to reduce radiation emissions ]</ref>

According to TEPCO the emissions immediately after the accident were around 220 billion becquerel; readings declined after that, and in November and December 2011 they dropped to 17 thousand becquerel, about one-13 millionth the initial level. But in January 2012 due to human activities at the plant, the emissions rose again up to 19 thousand becquerel. Radioactive materials around reactor 2, where the surroundings were still highly contaminated, got stirred up by the workers going in and out of the building, when they inserted an optical endoscope into the containment vessel as a first step toward decommissioning the reactor.<ref>NHK-world (24 January 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/society.html Radioactive release from Fukushima plant rises]</ref><ref>JAIF (24 January 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1327393821P.pdf Earth-quake report 327]</ref>

====Iodine-131====
A widely cited [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics|Austrian Meteorological Service]] report estimated the total amount of I-131 radiation released into the air as of 19&nbsp;March based on extrapolating data from several days of ideal observation at some of its worldwide [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|CTBTO]] radionuclide measuring facilities (Freiburg, Germany; Stockholm, Sweden; Takasaki, Japan and Sacramento, USA) during the first 10&nbsp;days of the accident.<ref name="newscientist1">{{cite web |url= http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20285-fukushima-radioactive-fallout-nears-chernobyl-levels.html |title=Fukushima radioactive fallout nears Chernobyl levels |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated17">{{cite web |url= http://www.zamg.ac.at/docs/aktuell/Japan2011-03-24_1600_E.pdf |title=Accident in the Japanese NPP Fukushima: Spread of Radioactivity |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref> The report's estimates of total I-131 emissions based on these worldwide measuring stations ranged from 10&nbsp;PBq to 700&nbsp;PBq.<ref name="autogenerated17"/> This estimate was 1% to 40% of the 1760&nbsp;PBq<ref name="autogenerated17"/><ref name="autogenerated18">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110412-4.pdf |title=INES Rating on the Events in Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station (source rounds off to 1800) |format=PDF |accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref> of the I-131 estimated to have been released at Chernobyl.<ref name="newscientist1"/>

A later, 12 April 2011, [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]] and [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|NSC]] report estimated the total air release of [[iodine-131]] at 130&nbsp;PBq and 150&nbsp;PBq, respectively <U+2013> about 30&nbsp;grams.<ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp"/> However, on 23&nbsp;April, the NSC revised its original estimates of iodine-131 released.<ref name="translate.google.com"/> The NSC did not estimate the total release size based upon these updated numbers, but estimated a release of 0.14&nbsp;TBq per hour on 5&nbsp;April."<ref name="translate.google.com"/><ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/>

On 22 September the results were published of a survey conducted by the Japanese Science Ministry. This survey showed that radioactive iodine was spread not only northwestward but also southwards of the plant. Soil samples were taken at 2,200 locations, mostly in Fukushima Prefecture, in June and July, and with this a map was created of the radioactive contamination as of 14&nbsp;June. Because of the short half-life of 8&nbsp;days only 400&nbsp;locations were still positive. This map showed that iodine-131 spread northwest of the plant, just like caesium-137 as indicated on an earlier map. But I-131 was also found south of the plant at relatively high levels, even higher than those of caesium-137 in coastal areas south of the plant. According to the ministry, clouds moving southwards apparently caught large amounts of iodine-131 that were emitted at the time. The survey was done to determine the risks for thyroid cancer within the population.<ref>JAIF (22 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316751455P.pdf Earthquake-report 213 Radioactive iodine spread south of nuclear plant]</ref>

====Tellurium-129m====
On 31 October the Japanese ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology released a map showing the contamination of radioactive tellurium-129m within a 100-kilometer radius around the Fukushima No.&nbsp;1 nuclear plant. The map displayed the concentrations found of tellurium-129m <U+2013> a byproduct of uranium fission <U+2013> in the soil at 14&nbsp;June 2011. High concentrations were discovered northwest of the plant and also at 28&nbsp;kilometers south near the coast, in the cities of Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, and Kitaibaraki, Ibaraki Prefecture. Iodine-131 was also found in the same areas, and most likely the tellurium was deposited at the same time as the iodine. The highest concentration found was 2.66&nbsp;million becquerels per square meter, two kilometers from the plant in the empty town of Okuma. Tellurium-129m has a half-life of 6&nbsp;days, so present levels are a very small fraction of the initial contamination. Tellurium has no biological functions, so even when drinks or food were contaminated with it, it would not accumulate in the body, like iodine in the thyroid gland.<ref>''The Mainichi Daily News'' (1 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111101p2a00m0na011000c.html  Gov't releases map of radioactive tellurium 129m contamination around nuke plant]</ref>

====Caesium-137====
On 24 March, the [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics|Austrian Meteorological Service]] report estimated the total amount of caesium-137 radiation released into the air as of 19&nbsp;March based on extrapolating data from several days of ideal observation at a handful of worldwide [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|CTBTO]] radionuclide measuring facilities. The agency estimated an average being 5,000&nbsp;TBq daily.<ref name="newscientist1"/><ref name="autogenerated17"/> Over the course of the disaster, Chernobyl put out a total of 85,000&nbsp;TBq of caesium-137.<ref name="newscientist1" /> However, later reporting on 12&nbsp;April estimated total caesium releases at 6,100&nbsp;TBq to 12,000&nbsp;TBq, respectively by NISA and NSC <U+2013> about 2<U+2013>4&nbsp;kg.<ref name="nisa.meti.go.jp"/> On 23 April, NSC updated this number to 0.14&nbsp;TBq per hour of caesium-137 on 5&nbsp;April, but did not recalculate the entire release estimate.<ref name="translate.google.com"/><ref name="yomiuri.co.jp"/>

====Strontium 90====
On 12 October 2011 a concentration of 195 becquerels/kilogram of [[Strontium-90]] was found in the sediment on the roof of an apartment building in the city of [[Yokohama]], south of Tokyo, some 250&nbsp;km from the plant in Fukushima. This first find of strontium above 100&nbsp;becquerels per kilogram raised serious concerns that leaked radioactivity might have spread far further than the Japanese government expected. The find was done by a private agency that conducted the test upon the request of a resident. After this find Yokohama city started an investigation of soil samples collected from areas near the building. The science ministry said that the source of the Strontium was still unclear.<ref>''The Mainichi Daily News'' (12 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20111012p2g00m0dm111000c.html Strontium-90 found in the city of Yokohama]</ref>

====Plutonium isotopes====
On 30 September 2011, the Japanese Ministry of Education and Science published the results of a plutonium fallout survey, for which in June and July 50 soil samples were collected from a radius of slightly more than 80&nbsp;km around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Plutonium was found in all samples, which is to be expected since plutonium from the nuclear weapon tests of the 1950s and '60s is found everywhere on the planet. The highest levels found (of Pu-239 and Pu-240 combined) were 15&nbsp;becquerels per square meters in Fukushima prefecture and 9.4&nbsp;Bq in Ibaraki prefecture, compared to a global average of 0.4 to 3.7 bq / kg from atomic bomb tests. Earlier in June, university researchers detected smaller amounts of plutonium in soil outside the plant after they collected samples during filming by NHK.<ref>JAIF (30 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317442784P.pdf Earthquake-report 221: Plutonium detected 45 kilometers from nuke plant]</ref>

A recent study published in Nature found up to 35 bq / kg plutonium 241 in leaf litter in 3 out of 19 sites in the most contaminated zone in Fukushima. They estimated the Pu-241 dose for a person living for 50 years in the vicinity of the most contaminated site to be 0.44<U+2005>mSv. However, the Cs-137 activity at the sites where Pu-241 was found was very high (up to 4.7Mbq / kg or about 135,000 times greater than the plutonium 241 activity), which suggests that it will be the Cs-137 which prevents habitation rather than the relatively small amounts of plutonium of any isotope in these areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2012/120308/srep00304/full/srep00304.html |title=Isotopic evidence of plutonium release into the environment from the Fukushima DNPP accident : Scientific Reports : Nature Publishing Group |publisher=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref>

===Water releases===
On 21 April, TEPCO estimated that 520 tons of radioactive water leaked into the sea before leaks in a pit in unit&nbsp;2 were plugged, totaling 4,700&nbsp;TBq of water release (calculated by simple sum, which is inconsistent with the IAEA methodology for mixed-nuclide releases<ref name="tepco.co.jp"/>) (20,000 times facility's annual limit).<ref name="tepco.co.jp"/><ref name="NHK520t">{{cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/21_35.html |title=TEPCO estimates 520-ton radioactive water into sea |publisher=NHK |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref> TEPCO's detailed estimates were 2,800&nbsp;TBq of I-131, 940&nbsp;TBq of Cs-134, 940&nbsp;TBq of Cs-137.<ref name="tepco.co.jp"/>

Another 300,000 tons of relatively less-radioactive water had already been reported to have leaked or been purposefully pumped into the sea to free room for storage of highly radioactively contaminated water.<ref name="ReferenceB">http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201105120189.html TEPCO drowning in dealing with tons of radioactive water</ref> TEPCO had attempted to contain contaminated water in the harbor near the plant by installing "curtains" to prevent outflow, but now believes this effort was unsuccessful.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

According to a report published in October 2011 by the [[Institut de radioprotection et de s<U+00FB>ret<U+00E9> nucl<U+00E9>aire|French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety]], between 21&nbsp;March and mid-July around 2.7&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;10<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Bq of caesium-137 (about 8.4&nbsp;kg) entered the ocean, about 82&nbsp;percent having flowed into the sea before 8&nbsp;April.<ref name = IRSN-Oct-2011>{{citation | url = http://www.irsn.fr/FR/Actualites_presse/Actualites/Documents/IRSN-NI-Impact_accident_Fukushima_sur_milieu_marin_26102011.pdf |title = Synth<U+00E8>se actualis<U+00E9>e des connaissances relatives <U+00E0> l'impact sur le milieu marin des rejets radioactifs du site nucl<U+00E9>aire accident<U+00E9> de Fukushima Dai-ichi | author = IRSN | date = 26 October 2011 | accessdate =03.01.2012}}</ref> This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emission of artificial radioactivity into the sea ever observed.  However, the Fukushima coast has some of the world's strongest currents and these transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, thus causing great dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plan might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil.  Further, some coastal areas might have less-favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far.  Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district.  Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution.  It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima. Despite caesium isotopic concentration in the waters off of Japan being 10 to 1000 times above concentration  prior to the accident, radiation risks are below what is generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers.<ref>Ken O.

===Exposure of workers===
Prior to the accident, the maximum permissible dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100&nbsp;mSv per year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry increased that annual limit to 250&nbsp;mSv, for emergency situations.<ref name=NYT16>{{Cite journal | journal=[[The New York Times]] | place = NY, USA | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16workers.html | edition = Asia | date = 2011<U+2010>3<U+2010>16 | title = Last Defense at Troubled Reactors: 50 Japanese Workers | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Radiation outside primary containment of the reactors===
Outside the primary containment, plant radiation-level measurements have also varied significantly.

On 25 March, an analysis of stagnant water in the basement floor of the turbine building of Unit 1 showed heavy contamination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nisa.meti.go.jp/english/files/en20110325-6.pdf |title=Regarding the result of concentration measurement in the stagnant water on the basement floor of the turbine building of Unit 1 of Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station |accessdate=26 March 2011 }}</ref>

On 27 March, TEPCO reported stagnant water in the basement of unit 2 (inside the reactor/turbine building complex, but outside the primary containment) was measured at 1000&nbsp;mSv/h or more, which prompted evacuation. The exact dose rate remains unknown as the technicians fled the place after their first measurement went off-scale. Additional basement and trench-area measurements indicated 60&nbsp;mSv/h in unit 1, "over 1000"&nbsp;mSv/h<ref name=TEPCO28/> in unit 2, and 750&nbsp;mSv/h in unit 3. The report indicated the main source was iodine-134<ref name=HNK27>{{cite web|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/27_12.html|title=Extreme radiation detected at No.2 reactor|date=27 March 2011|work=HNK}}</ref> with a half-life of less than an hour, which resulted in a radioactive iodine concentration 10&nbsp;million times the normal value in the reactor.<ref name=Reuters26/>  TEPCO later retracted its report, stating that the measurements were inaccurate and attributed the error to comparing the isotope responsible, [[isotopes of iodine|iodine-134]], to normal levels of another isotope.<ref name=WNN27/> Measurements were then corrected, stating that the iodine levels were 100,000 times the normal level.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/27/japan-nuclear-error-radiation-reading</ref> On 28 March, the erroneous radiation measurement caused TEPCO to reevaluate the software used in analysis.<ref>[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/01_28.html Program errors force TEPCO to review all data]</ref>

Measurements within the reactor/turbine buildings, but not in the basement and trench areas, were made on 18 April.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/world/asia/19japan.html Radiation Levels a Bar to New Plan for Japanese Nuclear Plant</ref> These robotic measurements indicated up to 49&nbsp;mSv/h in unit 1 and 57&nbsp;mSv/h in unit 3.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This is substantially lower than the basement and trench readings, but still exceeds safe working levels without constant worker rotation.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>[http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104190209.html Editorial: TEPCO must prepare for additional risks in taming Fukushima crisis]</ref> Inside primary containment, levels are much higher.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

By 23 March 2011, neutron radiation had been observed outside the reactors 13 times at the Fukushima I site. While this could indicate ongoing [[nuclear fission|fission]], a [[criticality accident|recriticality event]] was not believed to account for these readings.<ref>'''Neutron beam observed 13 times at crippled Fukushima nuke plant''' TOKYO, 23 March, Kyodo News http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/03/80539.html</ref> Based on those readings and TEPCO reports of high levels of chlorine-38, Dr. Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress speculated that transient criticalities may have occurred. However, Edwin Lyman at the Union of Concerned Scientists was skeptical, believing the reports of chlorine-38 to be in error.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ecocentric.blogs.time.com/2011/03/30/has-fukushimas-reactor-no-1-gone-critical/ |title=Has Fukushima's Reactor No. 1 Gone Critical? |work=Ecocentric |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=1 April 2011 }}</ref> TEPCO's chlorine-38 report was later retracted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-21/tepco-retracts-chlorine-arsenic-findings-at-fukushima-station.html |title=Tepco Retracts Chlorine, Arsenic Findings at Fukushima Station |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |first=Tsuyoshi |last=Inajima}}</ref> Noting that limited, uncontrolled chain reactions might occur at Fukushima I, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency ([[IAEA]]) "emphasized that the nuclear reactors won<U+2019>t explode."<ref>Fukushima Workers Threatened by Heat Bursts; Sea Radiation Rises By Jonathan Tirone, Sachiko Sakamaki and Yuriy Humber Mar/31/2011 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-30/record-high-levels-of-radiation-found-in-sea-near-crippled-nuclear-reactor.html</ref>

On 15 April, TEPCO reported that nuclear fuel had melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of three of the [[Fukushima I]] reactors, including reactor three. The melted material was not expected to breach one of the lower containers, causing a serious radiation release. Instead, the melted fuel was thought to have dispersed uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of reactors No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, making the resumption of the fission process, known as a "recriticality," most unlikely.<ref>[http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110415_5020.php ''Japan Plant Fuel Melted Partway Through Reactors: Report''], Friday, 15 April 2011</ref>

On 19 April, TEPCO estimated that the unit-2 turbine basement contained 25,000 cubic meters of contaminated water.<ref name="TEPCOTransfer">{{cite web |url=http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110419e2.pdf |title=Transfer to the Process Main Building |publisher=TEPCO |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref> The water was measured to have 3 MBq/cm3 of Cs-137 and 13 MBq/cm3 of I-131: TEPCO characterized this level of contamination as "extremely high."<ref name="TEPCOTransfer" /> To attempt to prevent leakage to the sea, TEPCO planned to pump the water from the basement to the Centralized Radiation Waste Treatment Facility.<ref name="TEPCOTransfer" />

===Site contamination===

====Soil====
TEPCO have reported at three sites 500 meters from the reactors that the caesium-134 and caesium-137 levels in the soil are between 7.1 kBq and 530 kBq per kilo of undried soil.<ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110713e15.pdf</ref> 

[[File:Chernboyl vs Fukuashima2.png|thumb|right|The Fukushima soil contamination compared with the Chernobyl release for a series of key isotopes. The two data sets have been adjusted to make the caesium-137 bars the same size to allow the isotope signatures to be compared with ease]]

Small traces of plutonium have been found in the soil near the stricken reactors: repeated examinations of the soil suggest that the plutonium level is similar to the background level caused by atomic bomb tests.<ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110713e14.pdf</ref> As the isotope signature of the plutonium is closer to that of power-reactor plutonium, TEPCO suggested that "two samples out of five may be the direct result of the recent incident."<ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/11032812-e.html Press Release (28 Mar 2011).
Detection of radioactive material in the soil in Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station</ref> The more important thing to look at is the [[curium]] level in the soil;<ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110713e17.pdf</ref> the soil does contain a short-lived isotope (curium-242) which shows that some [[alpha]] emitters have been released in small amounts by the accident. The release of the beta/gamma emitters such as caesium-137 has been far greater. In the short and medium term the effects of the iodine and the caesium release will dominate the effect of the accident on farming and the general public. In common with almost all soils, the soil at the reactor site contains [[uranium]], but the concentration of uranium and the isotope signature<ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110713e16.pdf</ref> suggests that the uranium is the normal, natural uranium in the soil.

Radioactive strontium-89 and strontium-90 were discovered in soil at the plant on 18 April, amounts detected in soil one-half kilometer from the facility ranging from 3.4 to 4400 Bq/kg of dry soil.<ref name="NHKStrontium" /><ref name="TEPCOStrontium" /><ref name="TEPCOStrontiumSea" />  Strontium remains in soil from above-ground nuclear testing; however, the amounts measured at the facility are approximately 130 times greater than the amount typically associated with previous nuclear testing.<ref name="NHKStrontium" /><ref name="TEPCOStrontiumSea" />

The isotope signature of the release looks very different to that of the Chernobyl accident:<ref>{{cite web|author=Name (required) |url=http://markforeman.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/more-isotope-data-from-japan/ |title=More isotope data from Japan <U+00AB> Mark Foreman's Blog |publisher=Markforeman.wordpress.com |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/betu11_e/images/110708e16.pdf</ref> the Japanese accident has released much less of the involatile plutonium, minor actinides and fission products than Chernobyl did.

On 31 March, TEPCO reported that it had measured radioactivity in the plant-site groundwater which was 10,000 times the government limit. The company did not think that this radiation had spread to drinking water.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-04-01-japanquake01_ST_N.htm | title=Nuclear crisis puts evacuation zones under scrutiny | accessdate=2 April 2011 | author=Rubin, Rita | date=1 April 2011 |work=USA Today}}</ref> NISA questioned the radioactivity measurement and TEPCO is re-evaluating it.<ref name="JapanTimesApr1">{{cite web | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110401x1.html | title=Iodine 131 found in groundwater | accessdate=3 April 2011 | author=Ito, Masami | date=1 April 2011 | work=The Japan Times Online}}</ref> Some debris around the plant has been found to be highly radioactive, including a concrete fragment emanating 900&nbsp;mSv/h.<ref>http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_01.html TEPCO: Highly radioactive concrete fragment found{{Dead link |date=May 2011}}</ref>

===Discharge to seawater and contaminated sealife===
Results revealed on 22 March from a sample taken by TEPCO about 100 m south of the discharge channel of units 1<U+2013>4 showed elevated levels of Cs-137, [[Caesium-134|caesium-134 (Cs-134)]] and I-131.<ref name=WNN22/> A sample of seawater taken on 22 March 330m south of the discharge channel (30 kilometers off the coastline) had elevated levels of I-131 and Cs-137.

==Radiation and Nuclide Detection in Japan==
Periodic overall reports of the situation in Japan are provided by the United States Department of Energy.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blog.energy.gov/content/situation-japan | title = The Situation in Japan | publisher = United States Department of Energy | accessdate =30 June 2011 }}</ref>

In April, 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant.  Potential exposure could exceed 20&nbsp;mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant.  That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}  However, natural radiation levels are higher in some parts of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.slideshare.net/energy/radiation-monitoring-data-from-fukushima-area-04182011 | publisher = United States Department of Energy | title = Radiological Assessment of effects fom Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant | date = 16 April 2011 | accessdate =20 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/04/a-map-of-fukushimas-radiation.html |title = A Map of Fukushima's Radiation Risks | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAA) | author = Jocelyn Kaiser | date = 22 April 2011 | accessdate =20 June 2011}}</ref>  Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.<ref name="sciencemag908">{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6032/908.full | title = Fukushima Revives The Low-Dose Debate | author = Dennis Normile | journal = Science | pages = 908<U+2013>910 | volume = 332 | date = 20 May 2011 | accessdate =21 June 2011 | doi = 10.1126/science.332.6032.908 | issue=6032 | pmid=21596968}}</ref> 

The highest detection of radiation outside of Fukushima peaked at 40 mSv. This represents a much lower level then the amount required to increase a persons risk of cancer. 100 mSv represents the level at which a definitive increased risk of cancer occurs. Radiation above this level increases the risk of cancer, and after 400 mSv radiation poisoning can occur, but is unlikely to be fatal.<ref name="phyast.pitt.edu">http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter5.html</ref><ref name="blacksmithinstitute.org">http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/blog/?p=511</ref><ref name="reuters.com">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/15/us-how-much-radiation-dangerous-idUSTRE72E79Z20110315</ref>

On 22 April 2011 a Japanese government report was presented by Minister of Trade Yukio Edano to leaders of the town Futaba. In it predictions were made about radiation releases for the years 2012 up to 2132. According to this report, in several parts of Fukushima Prefecture <U+2013> including Futaba and Okuma <U+2013> the air would remain dangerously radioactive at levels above 50 millisieverts a year. This was all based on measurements done in November 2011.<ref>The Japan Times (23 April 2012 )[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120423x2.html Fukushima air to stay radioactive in 2022]</ref>

In August 2012, Japanese academic researchers announced that 10,000 people living near the plant in Minamisoma City at the time of the accident had been exposed to well less than 1 millisievert of radiation.  The researchers stated that the health dangers from such exposure was "negligible".  Said participating researcher Masaharu Tsubokura, "Exposure levels were much lower than those reported in studies even several years after the Chernobyl incident."<ref>Boytchev, Hristio, "[http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/first-study-reports-very-low-internal-radioactivity-after-fukushima-disaster/2012/08/14/aadd1dc2-e628-11e1-8741-940e3f6dbf48_story.html First study reports very low internal radioactivity after Fukushima disaster]", ''[[Washington Post]]'', 15 August 2012</ref>

===Most detailed radiation map published by the Japanese government===
A detailed map was published by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, going online on 18 October 2011. The map contains the cesium concentrations and radiation levels caused by the airborn radiation from the Fukushima nuclear reactor. This website contains both web-based and PDF versions of the maps, providing information by municipality as had been the case previously, but also measurements by district. The maps were intended to help the residents who had called for better information on contamination levels between areas of the same municipalities, using soil and air sample data already released. A grid is laid over a map of most of eastern Japan. Selecting a square in the grid zooms in on that area, at which point users can choose more detailed maps displaying airborne contamination levels, cesium-134 or -137 levels, or total cesium levels.

On 18 June 2012 it became known that from 17 to 19 March 2011 in the days directly after the explosions, American military aircraft gathered radiation data in an area with a radius of 45 kilometers around the plant for the U.S. Department of Energy. The maps revealed radiation levels of more than 125 microsieverts per hour at 25 kilometers northwest of the plant, which means that people in these areas were exposed to the annual permissible dose within eight hours. The maps were neither made public nor used for evacuation of residents. 

On 18 March 2011 the U.S. government sent the data through the Japanese Foreign Ministry to the NISA under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology got the data on 20 March.

The data were not forwarded to the prime minister's office and the Nuclear Safety Commission, and subsequently not used to direct the evacuation of the people living around the plant. Because a substantial portion of radioactive materials released from the plant went northwest and fell onto the ground, and some residents were "evacuated" in this direction, these people could have avoided unnecessary exposure to radiation had the data been published directly. According to Tetsuya Yamamoto, chief nuclear safety officer of the Nuclear Safety Agency, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." But an official of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau of the technology ministry, Itaru Watanabe, said it was more appropriate for the United States, rather than Japan, to release the data.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (18 June 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120619p2g00m0dm004000c.html Japan failed to use U.S. radiation data gathered after nuke crisis]</ref> On 23 March - after the Americans - Japan released its own  fallout maps, compiled by Japanese authorities from measurements and predictions from the computer simulations of SPEEDI.

He defended his ministry's handling of the matter with the remark that its task was only to measure radiation levels on land. But the government should reconsider its decision not to publish the maps or use the information. Studies would be done by the authorities, whether the maps could have been a help with the evacuations.<ref>NHK-world (19 June 2012) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120619_23.html Govt to review its withholding of radiation maps]</ref><ref>JAIF (19 June 2012) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1340094210P.pdf Earthequake report No. 447: Govt to review its withholding of radiation maps]</ref>

Urine samples taken from 10 children in the capital of Fukushima Prefecture were analyzed in a French laboratory. All of them contained caesium-134. The sample of an eight-year-old girl contained 1.13 becquerels/liter. The children were living up to 60 kilometers away from the troubled nuclear power plant. The Fukushima Network for Saving Children urged the Japanese government to check the children in Fukushima. The Japanese non-profit Radiation Effects Research Foundation said that people should not overreact, because there are no reports known of health problems with these levels of radiation.<ref>''JAIF'' (1 July 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1309509349P.pdf Radiation detected in Fukushima children's urine ]</ref>

====Radioactive dust particles====
On 31 October 2011 a scientist from the [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], Marco Kaltofen, presented his findings on the releases of radioactive isotopes from the Fukushima accidents at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Airborne dust contaminated with radioactive particles was released from the reactors into the air. This dust was found in Japanese car filters: they contained cesium-134 and cesium-137, and cobalt at levels as high as 3 nCi total activity per sample. Materials collected during April 2011 from Japan also contained iodine-131. Soil and settled dust were collected from outdoors and inside homes, and also from used children's shoes. High levels of cesium were found on the shoelaces. US air-filter and dust samples did not contain "hot" particles, except for air samples collected in Seattle, Washington in April 2011. Dust particles contaminated with radioactive cesium were found more than 100 miles from the Fukushima site, and could be detected on the U.S. West Coast.<ref>APHA (31 October 2011) [http://apha.confex.com/apha/139am/webprogram/Paper254015.html Radiation Exposure to the Population in Japan After the Earthquake ]</ref>

In the first week of September the Ministry of Science published a new map showing radiation levels in Fukushima and 4 surrounding prefectures, based on the results of an aerial survey. In the map, different colors were used to show the level of radioactivity at locations one meter above the ground.
* Red: 19 microsieverts per hour or higher. The red band pointed in a north-west direction and was more than 30 kilometers long.
* Yellow: radiation between 3.8 to 19 microsieverts per hour. This corresponds to a less then a chest X-ray to 3 chest X-rays. This is the threshold to designate an area an evacuation zone. The yellow area extended far beyond the evacuation zone already put into place.
* Light green: radiation between 0.5 and one microsieverts per hour. This was still far above the annual level of one hundred millisievert, which should cause no harm to people. This zone contained: most of Fukushima Prefecture, southern parts of Miyagi Prefecture, and northern parts of Tochigi and Ibaraki prefectures.<ref>JAIF (&nbsp;12&nbsp;September&nbsp;2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315808560P.pdf Earthquake report 202: High levels of radiation found in remote areas]</ref>

Up to 307,000 [[becquerel]]s of cesium per kilogram of soil was detected during a survey held in [[Fukushima City]], 60 kilometers away from the crippled reactors, on 14 Sep 2011. This was triple the amount for contaminated soil that by Japanese governmental orders should be sealed into concrete. According to "Citizens Against Fukushima Aging Nuclear Power Plants", these readings were comparable to the high levels in special regulated zones where evacuation was required after the Chernobyl accident. They urged the government to designate the area as a hot spot, where residents would need to voluntarily evacuate and be eligible for state assistance. Professor Tomoya Yamauchi of the [[University of Kobe]], in charge of the study, in which soil samples were tested from five locations around the district, noted that the decontamination conducted in some of the areas tested has not yet reduced the radiation to pre-accident levels.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (5 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111005p2g00m0dm121000c.html High dosage of cesium found in soil outside Fukushima no-go zone]</ref>

On 18 October 2011 a hot-spot in a public square was found in the city of [[Kashiwa]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] in the Nedokoyadai district, by a resident walking with a dosimeter. He informed the city council: their first readings went off the scale, as their Geiger-counter could only measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation gave a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick. Further investigations and check-ups were planned on 24 October 2011.<ref>Mainichi Japan (21 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111022p2a00m0na027000c.html Chiba Pref. city finds major radioactive hot spot on public land ]</ref>  These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive cesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. The first comments of town officials on the find of 57.7 micro-Sieverts per hour were that there could not be a link with the Fukushima disaster, but after the find of this large amount of cesium, officials of the Science Ministry could not deny the possibility that the cause could be found at the Fukushima-site.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (23 October 2011)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20111023p2g00m0dm058000c.html  High-level radioactive cesium detected in soil in Kashiwa]</ref>

In October 2011, radiation levels as high as those in the evacuation zone around Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant were detected in a Tokyo suburb. Japanese officials said the contamination was linked to the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Contamination levels "as high as those inside Fukushima's no-go zone have been detected, with officials speculating that the hotspot was created after radioactive caesium carried in rain water became concentrated because of a broken gutter".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://australianetworknews.com/stories/201110/3347154.htm?desktop |title=Radiation hotspot found in Tokyo |author= Mark Willacy |date=25 October 2011 |work=Australia Network News }}</ref>

In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science launched a phone hotline to deal with concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search of all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized by the state of Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper way, how to hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.<ref>NHK-world (24 October 2011)[ NHK  http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/24_20.html]</ref><ref>JAIF (24 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1319440559P.pdf Earthquake-report 244]</ref>

In October 2011 hotspots were reported on the grounds of two elementary schools in [[Abiko, Chiba|Abiko]] in [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]]:
* 11.3 microsieverts per hour was detected on 25 September just above the surface of the ground near a ditch in the compounds of the Abiko Municipal Daiichi Elementary School. 50 centimeters above the ground the reading was 1.7 microsieverts per hour. The soil in the ditch contained 60,768 becquerels per kilogram. After the soil was removed the radiation declined to 0.6 microsieverts per hour at 50 centimeters above groundlevel.
* 10.1 microsieverts per hour was found at the Abiko Municipal Namiki Elementary School near the surface of the ground where sludge removed from the swimming pool of the school had been buried. The area was covered with a waterproof tarp and dirt was put on top of the tarp to decrease the radiation; 0.6 microsieverts per hour was measured 50 centimeters above the ground after this was done.<ref>The Mainichi Daily news( 26 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111026p2a00m0na010000c.html High levels of radiation detected at 2 schools in Chiba Prefecture]</ref>

Radioactive cesium was found in waste water discharged into Tokyo Bay from a cement factory in the prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] east of Tokio. In September and October two water samples were taken, measuring 1,103 becquerels per liter and 1,054 becquerels per liter respectively. These were 14 to 15 times higher than the limit set by [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency|NISA]]. Ash from incinerators in the prefecture constituted the raw material to produce cement. In this process toxic substances are filtered out of the ashes, and the water used to clean these filters was discharged into Tokyo Bay. On 2 November 2011 this waste-water discharge was halted, and the Japanese authorities started a survey on the cesium contamination of the seawater of Tokyo Bay near the plant.<ref>NHK-world (2 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/02_40.html Radioactive materials detected in Tokyo Bay]</ref><ref>JAIF (3 November 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320292646P.pdf  Earthquke-report 254]</ref>

====Cesium-134 & Cesium-137 soil-radiation-map====
On 12 November the Japanese government published a radiation map compiled by helicopter. This map covered a much wider area than before. Six new prefectures [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]], [[Nagano]], [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], [[Gifu Prefecture|Gifu]], and [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]] were included in this new map of the soil radiation of cesium-134 and cesium-137 in Japan. Contamination between 30,000 and 100,000 becquerels per square meter was found in [[Ichinoseki]] and [[<U+014C>sh<U+016B>, Iwate|Oshu]] (prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]]), in [[Saku, Nagano|Saku]], [[Karuizawa]] and [[Sakuho]] (prefecture [[Nagano]], in [[Tabayama]] (prefecture [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]]) and elsewhere.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (12 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111112p2a00m0na009000c.html Gov't updates radiation maps with data on six new prefectures]</ref>

====Computer simulations of cesium contamination====
Based on radiation measurements made all over Japan between 20 March and 20 April 2011, and the atmospheric patterns in that period, computer simulations were performed by an international team of researchers, in cooperation with the University of [[Nagoya]], in order to estimate the spread of radioactive materials like cesium-137. Their results, published in two studies<ref>PNAS (14 November 2011)[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/11/1112058108 Cesium-137 deposition and contamination of Japanese soils due to the Fukushima nuclear accident]</ref><ref>PNAS (14 November 2011)[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/09/1111724108 Assessment of individual radionuclide distributions from the Fukushima nuclear accident covering central-east Japan]</ref> on 14 November 2011, suggested that Cesium-137 reached up to the northernmost island of [[Hokkaido]], and even the regions of [[Chugoku]] and [[Shikoku]] in western Japan at more than 500 kilometers from the Fukushima plant. Rain accumulated the cesium in the soil. Measured radiation densities per kilogram reached 250 becquerels in eastern Hokkaido, and 25 becquerels in the mountains of western Japan. According to the research group, these levels were not high enough to require decontamination. Professor Tetsuzo Yasunari of the [[University of Nagoya]] called for a national soil-testing program because of the nationwide spread of radioactive material, and suggested identified hotspots, places with high radiation levels, should be marked with warning signs.<ref>NHK-world (15 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20111115_03.html Radioactive cesium may have reached Hokkaido]</ref><ref>JIAF (15 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1321326860P.pdf Earthquake-report 265]</ref> 

The first study concentrated on Cesium-137. Around the nuclear plant, places were found containing up to 40.000 becquerels/kg, 8 times the governmental safety limit of 5.000 becquerels/kg. Places further away were just below this maximum. East and north-east from the plant the soil was contaminated the most. North-west and westwards the soil was less contaminated, because of mountain protection. 

The second study had a wider scope, and was meant to study the geographic spread of more-radioactive isotopes, like tellurium and iodine. Because these isotopes deposit themselves in the soil with rain, Norikazu Kinoshita and his colleagues observed the effect of two specific rain-showers on 15 and 21 March 2011. The rainfall on 15 March contaminated the grounds around the plant; the second shower transported the radiation far further from the plant, in the direction of Tokyo. According to the authors, the soil should be decontaminated, but when this is found impossible, farming should be limited.<ref>Nu.nl (Dutch) (15 November 2011) [http://www.nu.nl/buitenland/2668174/voedselproductie-rondom-fukushima-mogelijk-belemmerd-.html Produce of food around Fukushima should probably be limited]</ref>

====Elementary school yard in Tokyo====
On 13 December 2011 extremely high readings of radioactive cesium <U+2013> 90,600 becquerels per kilogram, 11 times the governmental limit of 8000 bequerels <U+2013> were detected in a groundsheet at the Suginami Ward elementary school in Tokyo at a distance of 230 kilometers from Fukushima. The sheet was used to protect the school lawn against frost from 18 March until 6 April 2011.  Until November this sheet was stored alongside a gymnasium. In places near this storage area up to 3.95  microsieverts per hour were measured one centimeter above the ground. The school planned to burn the sheet. Further inspections were requested.<ref>NHK-world (13 December 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20111213_32.html Radioactive cesium detected in Tokyo grade school]</ref>

===Radiation exposure in the city of Fukushima===
All citizens of the town Fukushima received dosimeters to measure the precise dose of radiation to which they were exposed. After September the city of Fukushima collected the 36,478 "glass badges" of dosimeters from all its citizens for analysis. It turned out that 99 percent had not been exposed to more than 0.3 millisieverts in September 2011, except four young children from one family: a girl, in third year elementary school, had received 1.7 millisieverts, and her three brothers had been exposed to 1.4 to 1.6 millisieverts. Their home was situated near a highly radioactive spot, and after this find the family moved out of Fukushima Prefecture. A city official said that this kind of exposure would not affect their health.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (2 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111102p2a00m0na001000c.html Schoolgirl in Fukushima exposed to high level of radiation in September]</ref>

Similar results were obtained for a three-month period from September 2011: among a group of 36,767 residents in Fukushima city, 36,657 had been exposed to less than 1 millisievert, and the average dose was 0.26 millisieverts. For 10 residents, the readings ranged from 1.8 to 2.7 millisieverts, but these values are mostly believed to be related to usage errors (dosimeters left outside or exposed to X-ray luggage screening).<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (13 January 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120113p2g00m0dm013000c.html Fukushima city says radiation dose level unlikely to harm health]</ref>

===Disposal of radioactive ash===
Due to objections from concerned residents it became more and more difficult to dispose of the ashes of burned household garbage in and around Tokyo. The ashes of waste facilities in the [[T<U+014D>hoku region|Tohoku]], [[Kant<U+014D> region|Kanto]] and [[K<U+014D>shin'etsu region]]s were proven to be contaminated with radioactive cesium. According to the guidelines of the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]], ashes radiating 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower could be buried. Ashes with cesium levels between 8,000 and 100,000 becquerels should be secured, and buried in concrete vessels. A survey was done on 410 sites of waste-disposal facilities, on how the ash disposal was proceeding. At 22 sites, mainly in the Tokyo Metropolitan area, the ashes with levels under 8000 becquerels could not be buried due to the objections of concerned residents. At 42 sites, ashes were found that contained over 8,000 becquerels of cesium, which could not be buried. The ministry made plans to send officials to meetings in the  municipalities to explain to the Japanese people that the waste disposal was done safely, and to demonstrate how the disposal of the ashes above 8000 bequerels was conducted.<ref>JAIF (26 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317010815P.pdf Earthquake-report 216: Burying of radioactive household waste challenging]</ref>

On 5 January 2012 the Nambu (south) Clean Center, a waste incinerator in [[Kashiwa, Chiba]], was taken out of production by the city council because the storage room was completely filled with 200 metric tons of radioactive ash that could not disposed of in landfills. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still to be taken out of the incinerator. In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. The Center's special advanced procedures were able to minimize the volume of the ash, but radioactive cesium was concentrated to levels above the national limit of 8.000 becquerels per kilogram for waste disposal in landfills. It was not possible to secure new storage space for the radioactive ash. Radiation levels in Kashiwa were higher than in surrounding areas, and ashes containing up to 70,800 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram <U+2013> higher than the national limit <U+2013> were detected in the city. Other cities around Kashiwa were facing the same problem: radioactive ash was piling up. Chiba prefecture asked [[Abiko, Chiba|Abiko]] and [[Inzai, Chiba|Inzai]] to accept temporary storage at the Teganuma waste-disposal facility located at their border. But this met strong opposition from their citizens.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (5 January 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20120105p2a00m0na019000c.html Kashiwa stops operation of incinerator again as radioactive ash fills up storage]</ref>

===Deposition of radioactivity and effect on agricultural products and building materials===
Radiation monitoring in all 47 [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] showed wide variation, but an upward trend in 10 of them on 23 March. No deposition could be determined in 28 of them until 25 March<ref name=IAEAiodine/> The highest value obtained was in Ibaraki (480&nbsp;Bq/m<sup>2</sup> on 25 March) and Yamagata (750&nbsp;Bq/m<sup>2</sup> on 26 March) for iodine-13. For cesium-137, the highest values were in Yamagata at 150 and 1200&nbsp;Bq/m<sup>2</sup> respectively.<ref name=IAEAiodine/>

Measurements made in Japan in a number of locations have shown the presence of [[radionuclide]]s in the ground.<ref name=IAEAiodine/> On 19 March, upland soil levels of 8,100&nbsp;Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 300,000&nbsp;Bq/kg of I-131 were reported. One day later, the measured levels were 163,000&nbsp;Bq/kg of Cs-137 and 1,170,000&nbsp;Bq/kg of I-131.<ref name=Mext>{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/component/english/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2011/03/24/1304097_2410.pdf|title=Readings of environmental monitoring samples|date=24 March 2011|work=MEXT}}</ref>

====Agricultural products====
On 19 March, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced that levels of radioactivity exceeding legal limits had been detected in milk produced in the Fukushima area and in certain vegetables in Ibaraki. On 21 March, IAEA confirmed that "in some areas, iodine-131 in milk and in freshly grown leafy vegetables, such as spinach and spring onions, is significantly above the levels set by Japan for restricting consumption". One day later, iodine-131 (sometimes above safe levels) and caesium-137 (always at safe levels) detection was reported in Ibaraki prefecture.<ref name=IAEAiodine/> On 21 March, levels of radioactivity in spinach grown in the open air in Kitaibaraki city in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], around 75 kilometers south of the nuclear plant, were 24,000&nbsp;[[becquerel (Bq)]]/kg of iodine-131, 12 times more than the limit of 2,000&nbsp;Bq/kg, and 690&nbsp;Bq/kg of caesium, 190&nbsp;Bq/kg above the limit.<ref name=spinach/> In four Prefectures (Ibaraki, Totigi, Gunma, Fukushima), distribution of spinach and [[kakina]] was restricted as well as milk from Fukushima.<ref name=IAEAiodine/> On 23 March, similar restrictions were placed on more leafy vegetables ([[komatsuna]], cabbages) and all flowerheads [[brassica]]s (like cauliflower) in Fukushima, while [[parsley]] and milk distribution was restricted in Ibaraki.<ref name=IAEAiodine/> On 24 March, IAEA reported that virtually all milk samples and vegetable samples taken in Fukushima and Ibaraki on 18<U+2013>21 and 16<U+2013>22 March respectively were above the limit. Samples from Chiba, Ibaraki and Tochigi also had excessive levels in [[celery]], parsley, spinach and other leafy vegetables.

Hay and straw were found contaminated with cesium, 80 kilometers from the reactors, far outside the evacuation zone. The news of the contamination of foods with radioactive substances leaking from the Fukushima nuclear reactors damaged the mutual trust between local food producers, including farmers, and consumers. Everywhere in Japan banners and stickers were found with the caption "Hang in there, Fukushima!", whereas numerous harmful rumors about Fukushima products could be found online. Many rumors that were discriminatory to Fukushima and other messages slandering Fukushima people could be found on the Internet. The source of cesium was found to be rice straw that had been fad to the animals. But a notice from the Japanese government that was sent to cattle farmers after the nuclear accident made no mention of the possibility that rice straw could be contaminated with radioactive materials from the plants.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News( 25 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20111025p2a00m0na005000c.html  Nuclear plant accidents threaten relations between food producers and consumers]</ref> Beef from Fukushima Prefecture was taken from the distribution channels. But health minister Kohei Otsuka mentioned on 17 July 2011 that this might not be sufficient. An inspection was set up, testing the urine of all cows, to be able to return those cows that showed levels of radioactive substances higher than the government-set limit to farms so they could be decontaminated by feeding them safe hay. According to the minister, the Japanese government should try to buy uncontaminated straw and hay in other parts of the country and offer this to the farmers in the affected areas.<ref>''Japan-times'' (17 July 2011) [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110717x2.html Shipment ban on beef may widen ]</ref> All transport of beef raised in the prefecture Fukushima was <!-- will be --> prohibited after 19 July.

In March 2012 up to 18,700 becquerels per kilogram radioactive cesium was detected in [[yamame]], or landlocked masu salmon, caught in the [[Niida]] river near the town [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate]], which was over 37 times the legal limit of 500 becquerels/kg. The fish was caught for testing purposes prior to the opening of the fishing season. Fishing cooperatives were asked to refrain from catching and eating yamame fish from this river and all streams adjacent to it. No fish was sold in local markets.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (30 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120330p2a00m0na008000c.html Highest level of radioactive cesium to date found in freshwater fish in Fukushima village]</ref>

No fishing was allowed in the river [[Nojiri]] in the region Okuaizu in Fukushima after-mid March 2012. The fish caught in this river contained 119 to 139 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram, although this river is located some 130 kilometers from the damaged reactors. In 2011 at this place the fish measured only about 50 becquerels per kilogram, and the fishing season was opened as usual. But fishing was not popular in 2011. Local people hoped it would be better in 2012. After the new findings the fishing season was prosponed.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (31 March 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20120331p2a00m0na010000c.html Fukushima fishermen hopeless after nuke contamination postpones fishing season]</ref>

On 28 March 2012 [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] caught in the [[Akagi Onuma]] lake near the city of [[Maebashi]] in the prefecture [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]] was found to be contaminated with 426 becquerels per kilogram of cesium.<ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp">The Mainichi Shimbun (4 April 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120404p2g00m0dm032000c.html Cesium in excess of new gov't limit detected in smelt from Gunma lake]</ref>

In April 2012 radioactive cesium concentrations of 110 becquerels per kilogram were found in [[silver carp|silver crucian carp fish]] caught in the [[Tone River]] north of Tokyo, some 180 kilometers away from the Fukushima Daiichi Plant. Six fishery cooperatives and 10 towns along the river were asked to stop all shipments of fish caught in the river. In March 2012 fish and shellfish caught in a pond near the same river were found to contain levels above the new legal limits of 100 becquerels per kilogram.<ref>JAIF (26 April 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1335433576P.pdf EaRTHQUAKE REPORT 412: Cesium contaminated fish found in Tone river]</ref>

The Dutch bio-farming company Waterland International and a Japanese federation of farmers made an agreement in March 2012 to plant and grow [[camelia]] on 2000 to 3000 hectare. The seeds will be used to produce bio-diesel, which could be used to produce electricity. According to director William Nolten the region had a big potential for the production of clean energy. Some 800,000 hectares in the region could not be used to produce food anymore, and after the disaster because of fears for contamination the Japanese people refused to buy food produced in the region anyway. Experiments would be done to find out whether camelia was capable of extracting caesium from the soil. An experiment with [[sunflowers]] had no success.<ref>(Dutch) NRC (14 March 2012)[http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/03/14/nederlands-bedrijf-verbouwt-biobrandstofgewassen-bij-fukushima/ Dutch company grows bio/diesel in Fukushima]</ref>

High levels of radioactive cesium were found in 23 varieties of freshwater fish sampled at five rivers and lakes in Fukushima Prefecture between December 2011 and February 2012 and in 8 locations on the open sea. On 2 July 2012 the Ministry of the Environment published that it had found radioactive cesium between 61 to 2,600 becquerels per kilogram. 2,600 bequerels were found in a kind of goby caught in Mano River, which flows from [[Iitate, Fukushima|Iitate Village]] to the city of [[Minamis<U+014D>ma, Fukushima|Minamisoma]], north of the nuclear plant. Water bugs, common food for freshwater fish, also showed high levels of 330 to 670 becquerels per kilogram. Marine fish was found less contaminated and showed levels between 2.15 to 260 Bq/kg. Marine fish might be more capable of excreting cesium from their bodies, because saltwater fish have the ability to excrete salt. The Japanese Ministry of the Environment would closely monitor freshwater fish as radioactive cesium might remain for much longer periods in their bodies. According to Japanese regulations, food is considered safe for consumption up to a maximum of 100 Bq/kg.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (03 July 2012)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120703p2g00m0dm035000c.html High level of radioactive cesium detected in Fukushima freshwater fish]</ref><ref>JAIF (07 July 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1341298285P.pdf Earthequake-report 457: High cesium levels in Fukushima freshwater fish]</ref>

In August 2012, the Health ministry found that cesium levels had dropped to undetectable levels in most cultivated vegetables from the effected area, while food sourced from forests, rivers or lakes in the Tohoku and northern Kanto regions are showing excessive contamination.<ref name="japtimes25Sep12">Aoki, Mizuho, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120925i1.html Cesium contamination in food appears to be on wane]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 25 September 2012, p. 3</ref>

====Cattle and beef====
As of July 2011, the Japanese government has been unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation's food, and "Japanese agricultural officials say meat from more than 500 cattle that were likely to have been contaminated with radioactive caesium has made its way to supermarkets and restaurants across Japan".<ref name="Hiroko Tabuchi"/> On 22 July it became known that at least 1400 cows were shipped from 76 farms that were fed with contaminated hay and rice-straw that had been distributed by agents in Miyagi and farmers in the prefectures of Fukushima and Iwate, near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Supermarkets and other stores were asking their customers to return the meat. Farmers were asking for help, and the Japanese government was considering whether it should buy and burn all this suspect meat.<ref>''Jaif'' (22 July 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1311309389P.pdf Earthquake Report 150 ]</ref> Beef had 2% more Caesium then the governments strict limits.<ref>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-04-01-japanquake01_ST_N.htm</ref>

On 26 July the body-count was more than 2,800 cows fed with cesium-contaminated food, shipped to 46 of the 47 prefectures in Japan, with only Okinawa remaining free. Part of this beef, which had reached the markets, still needed to be tested. In an attempt to ease consumer concern the Japanese government promised to impose inspections on all this beef, and to buy the meat back when higher-than-permissible cesium levels were detected during the tests. The government planned to eventually pass on the buy-back costs to TEPCO.<ref>''Jaif'' (26 July 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1311653664P.pdf Japanese Government to buy back beef with excessive cesium levels]</ref> The same day the Japanese ministry of agriculture urged farmers and merchants to renounce the use and sale of compost made of manure from cows that may have been fed the contaminated straw. The measure also applied to humus from leaves fallen from trees. After developing guidelines for safety levels of radioactive caesium in compost and humus, this voluntary ban could be lifted.<ref>''Jaif'' (26 July 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1311736194P.pdf Japanese Government wants a voluntary ban on the use and sales of compost and humus]</ref>

On 28 July a ban was imposed on all the shipments on cattle from the prefecture [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]]. Some 1,031 beasts had been shipped that probably were fed with contaminated rice-straw. Measurements of 6 of them revealed 1,150 becquerels per kilogram, more than twice the governmental set safety level. Because the origins were scattered all over the prefecture, Miyagi became the second prefecture with a ban on all beef-cattle shipments. In the year before 11 March about 33,000 cattle were traded from Miyagi.<ref>''Jaif'' (28 July 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1311826071P.pdf Ban on all cattle from Miyagi prefecture]</ref>

On 1 August a ban was put on all cattle in the prefecture [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], after 6 cows from two villages were found with heavy levels of caesium. Iwate was the third prefecture where this was decided. Shipments of cattle and meat would only be allowed after examination, and when the level of caesium was below the regulatory standard. In Iwate some  36,000 cattle was produced in a year. All cattle would be checked for radiation exposure before shipment, and the Japanese government asked the prefecture to temporarily reduce the number of shipments to match its inspection capability.<ref>''Jaif'' (1 August 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1312260233P.pdf Govt bans beef cattle shipments from Iwate ]</ref>

On 3 August, yet another local government in western Japan, the prefecture [[Shimane]], decided to conduct radiation checks on all beef cattle to ease consumer concerns about food safety. Starting from the second week of August all cattle would be tested. Late July at one farm in this prefecture rice-straw was discovered with radioactive caesium levels exceeding the government safety guide. Although all other tests of beef cattle found far lower levels of radioactivity than the government standard, prices of beef from Shimane plummeted and wholesalers avoided all cattle from the prefecture. All processed beef would undergo preliminary screening, and meat registering 250 becquerels per kilogram or more of radioactive caesium <U+2013> half the government safety level <U+2013> would be tested further.<ref>''Jaif'' (3 August 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1312346723P.pdf Shimane Prefecture to test all beef cattle]</ref>

The second week of August the prefecture of [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] started with a buy-out of all cattle that could not be sold because the high levels of caesium in the meat. The prefecture decided to buy back all beef cattle that had become too old for shipment due to the shipping suspension in place since July. 
On 2 August a group of farmers agreed with the Fukushima prefectural government to set up a consultative body as early as next week to regulate this process. The prefectural government would provide the subsidies needed. There was some delay, because the farmers and the local government could not agree about the prices for the cattle, further negotiations were needed. The problems for the farmers were growing, because they did not know how to protect their cattle from contamination and did not know how to feed their cattle. A senior official of the farmers said that the buy-up plan needed to be implemented without any delay.<ref>''Jaif'' (3 August 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1312346723P.pdf Fukushima to begin beef cattle buy-up second week of August]</ref>

In response to calls for more support by farmers the Japanese government unfolded on 5 August 2011 a plan to buy up all beef contaminated with radioactive caesium, that had already reached the distribution chains, as an additional measurement to support beef cattle farmers. 
The plan included:
* the buy-out of about 3,500 head of cattle suspected to have been fed with contaminated rice straw, with caesium in excess of the safety limit.
* regardless the fact that some beef could be within the national safety limits.
* all this meat would be burned, to keep it out of distribution-channels
Other measurements were the expansion of subsidies to beef cattle farmers:
* Farmers who were unable to ship their cattle due to restrictions received 50,000 yen, (~ 630 dollars) per head of cattle regardless of the cattle's age.
* financial support was offered to prefectures that were buying up beef cattle, that had become too old to ship due to the ban.
* The Japanese Government planned to go on to buy all beef containing unsafe levels of radioactive caesium that reached the market through private organizations.<ref>''Jaif'' (5 August 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1312514317P.pdf Japanese Government to buy up all cesium-contaminated beef Natto makers to seek damages from TEPCO ]</ref>

On 19 August 2011 was reported, the meat of 4 cows from one Fukushima farm had been found to be contaminated with radioactive caesium in excess of the government-set safety limits. The day after the meat of 5 other cows from this farm was also found to contain radioactive caesium. Because of this the central government delayed lifting a shipment ban on Fukushima beef. The 9 cows were among a total of over 200 head of cattle shipped from the farm and slaughtered at a facility in Yokohama city between the 11 March nuclear accident and April. The beef had been stored by a food producer. The farmer denied feeding the cows contaminated rice straw, instead he used imported hay that had been stored at another farm.<ref>''Jaif'' (21 August 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313897576P.pdf More contaminated cows from Fukushima]</ref>

The Fukushima nuclear disaster emitted radiation that has caused damage to food crops, grains, grasses and even feed for other animals. The use of any of these grasses or crops in that area will get a dose of the radiation in whatever area that has radiation. Not only is wildlife extremely affected by the radiation, but wildlife also creates the risk of spreading radiation. According to BBC News,"Japan has planned to ban Fukushima beef. Naturally, these domestic animals have been affected by food supply. It has been reported that <U+201C>136 cows were found to have consumed feed affected by radioactive caesium<U+201D> and <U+201C>increasing numbers of cows have been found to have consumed rice straw containing high levels of radioactive caesium.<U+201D>  They also report that this meat has already been distributed across the country and that it <U+201C>could have already reached consumers.<U+201D> Additionally, they have traced contaminated beef on farms near the Fukushima power plant, but also farms "as far as 100km (70 miles) away. "The government has also acknowledged that the problem could be wider than just Fukushima.<U+201D> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14181046 |author=BBC News |title=Japan plans to ban Fukushima beef |date=July 18, 2011.}}</ref>

By August 2012, sampling of beef from affected areas revealed that 3 out of 58 460 beef samples contained radioactivity above regulatory limits. Much of the radiation is feared to have come from contaminated feed. Radiation infiltration into the beef supply has subsided with time, and is projected to continue decreasing.<ref name="japantimes.co.jp"/>

====Natto====
In August 2011, a group of 5 manufacturers of [[natto]], or fermented soybeans, in [[Mito, Ibaraki]] planned to seek damages from TEPCO because their sales had fallen by almost 50 percent. Natto is normally packed in rice-straw and after the discovery of  caesium contamination, they had lost many customers. The lost sales from April<U+2013>August 2011 had risen to around 1.3 million dollars.<ref>''Jaif'' (13 August 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1313211529P.pdf Natto makers to seek damages from TEPCO ]</ref>

====Tea-leaves====
On 3 September 2011 radioactive caesium exceeding the government's safety limit had been detected in tea leaves in Chiba and Saitama prefectures, near Tokyo. This was the ministry's first discovery of radioactive substances beyond legal limits since the tests of food stuffs started in August. These tests were conducted in order to verify local government data using different numbers and kinds of food samples. Tea leaves of one type of tea from Chiba Prefecture contained 2,720 becquerels of radioactive caesium per kilogram, 5 times above the legal safety limit. A maximum of 1,530 becquerels per kilogram was detected in 3 kinds of tea leaves from Saitama Prefecture. Investigations were done to find out where the tea was grown, and to determine how much tea had already made its way to market. Tea producers were asked to recall their products, when necessary.<ref>''JAIF'' (4 September 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315108656P.pdf Cesium beyond limit found in Chiba, Saitama tea]</ref>

In the prefecture [[Shizuoka]] at the beginning of April 2012, tests done on tea-leaves grown inside a greenhouse were found to contain less than 10 becquerels per kilogram, below the new limit of 10 becquerels, The tests were done in a governmental  laboratory in [[Kikugawa]] city, to probe cesium-concentrations before the at the end of April the tea-harvest season would start.<ref name="mdn.mainichi.jp"/>

The health ministry published in August 2012, that cesium levels in tea made from "yacon" leaves and in samples of Japanese tea "shot through the ceiling" this year.<ref name="japtimes25Sep12"/>

====Rice====
On 19 August radioactive caesium was found in a sample of rice. This was in Ibaraki Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, in a sample of rice from the city of Hokota, about 100 miles south of the radiation-spewing nuclear plant. The prefecture said the radiation was well within safe levels: it measured 52 becquerels per kilogram, about one-tenth of the government-set limit for grains. Two other samples tested at the same time showed no contamination. The Agriculture Ministry said it was the first time that more than trace levels of cesium had been found in rice.<ref>New York Times (19 August 2011) [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/world/asia/20rice.html?scp=5&sq=fukushima&st=cse Radiation Discovered in Rice Near Tokyo]</ref>

On 16 September 2011 the results were published of the measurements of radioactive cesium in rice. The results were known of around 60 percent of all test-locations. Radioactive materials were detected in 94 locations, or 4.3 percent of the total. But the highest level detected so far, in Fukushima prefecture, was 136 becquerels per kilogram, about a quarter of the government's safety limit of 500 Becquerel per kilogram. Tests were conducted in 17 prefectures, and were  completed in more than half of them. In 22 locations radioactive materials were detected in harvested rice. The highest level measured was 101.6 becquerels per kilogram, or one fifth of the safety limit. Shipments of rice did start in 15 prefectures, including all 52 municipalities in the prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]]. In Fukushima shipments of ordinary rice did start in 2 municipalities, and those of early-harvested rice in 20 municipalities.<ref>JAIF (18 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316403219P.pdf  Earthquake-report 209: Cesium detected in 4% of tested rice]</ref>

On 23 September 2011 radioactive caesium in concentrations above the governmental safety limit was found in rice samples collected in an area in the northeastern part of the prefecture Fukushima. Rice-samples taken before the harvest showed 500 becquerels per kilogram in the city of Nihonmatsu. The Japanese government ordered a two way testing procedure of samples taken before and after the harvest. Pre-harvest tests were carried out in nine prefectures in the regions of [[Tohoku]] and [[Kant<U+014D> region|Kanto]]. After the find of this high level of cesium, the prefectural government dis increase the number of places to be tested within the city from 38 to about 300. The city of [[Nihonmatsu]] held an emergency meeting on 24 September with officials from the prefecture government. The farmers, that already had started harvesting, were ordered to store their crop until the post-harvest tests were available.<ref>JAIF (25 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1316921446P.pdf  Earthquake-report 215: Safety limit radioactive cesium in Fukushima rice]</ref>

All rice of the fields nearby was stored and none of this rice had been sold to the market. On 18 November all 154 farmers in the district were asked to suspend all shipments of rice. Tests were ordered on rice samples from all 154 farms in the district. The result of this testing was reported on 25 November: five more farms were found with cesium contaminated rice at a distance of 56 kilometers from the disaster reactors in the Oonami district of Fukushima City, The highest level of cesium detected was 1,270 becquerels per kilogram.<ref>NHK-world (25 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20111125_37.html More Fukushima rice tainted with cesium]</ref>

On 28 November 2011 the prefecture of Fukushima reported the find of cesium-contaminated rice, up to 1050 Becquerels per kilogram, in samples of 3 farms in the city [[Date, Fukushima|Date]] at a distance of 50 kilometers from the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. Some 9 kilo's of this crops were already sold locally before this date. Officials tried to find out who bought this rice. Because of this and earlier finds the government of the prefecture Fukushima decided to control more than 2300 farms in the whole district on cesium-contamination.<ref>NHK-world (29 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20111129_19.html Cesium detected from more Fukushima rice]</ref><ref>JAIF (29 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1322541949P.pdf Earthquake report 276]</ref> A more precise number was mentioned by the Japanese newspaper [[The Mainichi Daily News]]: on 29 November orders were given to 2381 farms in [[Nihonmatsu]] and [[Motomiya]] to suspend part of their rice shipments. This number added to the already halted shipments at 1941 farms in 4 other districts including [[Date District, Fukushima|Date]], raised the total to 4322 farms.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (29 November 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111129p2g00m0dm070000c.html Farm households in 2 Fukushima cities to suspend rice shipments]</ref>

Rice exports from Japan to China became possible again after a bilateral governmental agreement in April 2012. With government-issued certificates of origin Japanese rice produced outside the prefectures [[Chiba prefecture|Chiba]], [[Fukushima prefecture|Fukushima]], [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]], [[Ibaraki prefecture|Ibaraki]],  [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]], [[Nagano prefecture|Nagano]], [[Miyagi prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]], [[Tokyo prefecture|Tokyo]], [[Tochigi prefecture|Tochigi]] and [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]] was allowed to be exported. In the first shipment 140.000 tons of [[Hokkaido prefecture|Hokkaido]] rice of the 2011 harvest was sold to [[China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation]].<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (14 April 2012) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120414p2g00m0bu007000c.html Japan resumes rice exports to China]</ref>

====Noodles====
On 7 February 2011 noodles contaminated with radioactive cesium (258 becquerels of cesium per kilogram) were found in a restaurant in [[Okinawa]]. The noodles, called "Okinawa soba", were apparently produced with water filtered through contaminated ashes from wood originating from the prefecture Fukushima. On 10 February 2012 the Japanese Agency for Forestry set out a warning not to use ashes from wood or charcoal, even when the wood itself contained less than the governmental set maximum of 40 becquerels per kilo for wood or 280 becquerels for charcoal. When the standards were set, nobody thought about the use of the ashes to be used for the production of foods. But, in Japan it was a custom to use ashes when kneading noodles or to take away a bitter taste, or "aku" from "devil's tongue" and wild vegetables.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (13 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120213p2a00m0na010000c.html High level of radioactive cesium found in Okinawa noodles]</ref>

====Mushrooms====
On 13 October 2011 the city of [[Yokohama]] terminated the use of dried shiitake-mushrooms in school lunches after tests had found radioactive cesium in them up to 350 bcquerels per kilogram. In shiitake mushrooms grown outdoors on wood in a city in the prefecture [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], 170 kilometers from the nuclear plant, samples contained 830 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium, exceeding the government's limit of 500 becquerels. Radioactive contaminated shiitake mushrooms, above 500 becquerels per kilogram, were also found in two cities of prefecture [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], therefore restrictions were imposed on the shipments from these cities.<ref>NHK-world (14 October 2011)</ref>

On 29 October the government of the prefecture [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] announced that shiitake mushrooms grown indoors at a farm in [[Soma]], situated at the coast north from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, were contaminated with radioactive cesium: They contained 850 becquerels per kilogram, and exceeded the national safety-limit of 500-becquerel. The mushrooms were grown on beds made of woodchips mixed with other nutrients. The woodchips in the mushroom-beds sold by the agricultural cooperative of Soma were thought to have caused of the contamination. Since 24 October 2011 this farm had shipped 1,070 100-gram packages of shiitake mushrooms to nine supermarkets. Besides these no other shiitake mushrooms produced by the farm were sold to customers.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (30 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20111030p2g00m0dm023000c.html Excessive cesium detected in greenhouse-grown mushrooms in Fukushima]</ref>

In the city of [[Yokohama]] in March and October food was served to 800 people with dried [[shiitake]]-mushrooms that came from a farm near this town at a distance of 250 kilometer from Fukushima. The test-results of these mushrooms showed 2,770 Becquerels per kilo in March and 955 Becquerels per kilo in October, far above the limit of 500 Becquerels per kilo set by the Japanese government. The mushrooms were checked for contamination in the first week of November, after requests of concerned people with questions about possible contamination of the food served. No mushrooms were sold elsewhere.<ref>JAIF (5 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320469975P.pdf Earthquake-report 256: Cesium contaminated mushrooms served in food]</ref>

On 10 November 2011 some 120 kilometers away southwest from the Fukushima-reactors in the prefecture [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] 649 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram was measured in [[kuritake]] mushrooms. Four other cities of Tochigi did already stop with the sales and shipments of the mushrooms grown there. The farmers were asked to stop all shipments and to call back the mushrooms already on the market.<ref>NHK-world (11 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/11_10.html High level of radioactivity in Tochigi mushrooms]</ref><ref>JAIF (11 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320979544P.pdf Earthquake-report 262]</ref>

On 2 July samples of tapwater taken in Tokyo Shinjuku ward radioactive caesium-137 was detected for the first time since April. The concentration was 0.14 becquerel per kilogram and none was discovered yesterday, which compares with 0.21 becquerel on 22 April, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health. No caesium-134 or iodine-131 was detected. The level was below the safety limit set by the government. "This is unlikely to be the result of new radioactive materials being introduced, because no other elements were detected, especially the more sensitive iodine", into the water supply, were the comments of Hironobu Unesaki, a nuclear engineering professor at Kyoto University.<ref>''sfgate'' (4 July 2011) [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/07/03/bloomberg1376-LNS8HU1A1I4H01-0NUT9KC0HS2K9NJAM17MPAO2OS.DTL  Cesium-137 found in tapwater Tokyo]</ref>

====Breast milk====
Small amounts of radioactive [[iodine]] were found in the [[breast milk]] of women living east of Tokyo. However, the levels were below the safety limits for tap water consumption by infants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/small-amounts-of-radioactive-iodine-found-in-breast-milk |title=Small amounts of radioactive iodine found in breast milk of 4 women |publisher=Japan Today |date=21 April 2011 |accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>  Regulatory limits for infants in Japan are several levels of magnitude beneath what is known to potentially affect human health{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.

====Baby-milk====
Mid November 2011 radioactive cesium was found in milk-powder for baby-food produced by the food company [[Meiji Dairies|Meiji Co.]] Although this firm was warned about this matter three times, the matter was only taken seriously by its consumer service after it was approached by [[Kyodo News]]. Up to 30.8 becquerels per kilogram was found in Meiji Step milk powder. While this is under the governmental safety-limit of 200 becquerels per kilogram, this could be more harmful for young children. Because of this cesium-contaminated milk powder, the Japanese minister of health Yoko Komiyama said on 9 December 2011 at a press conference, that her ministry would start regularly tests on baby food products in connection with the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis, every three months and more frequently when necessary. Komiyama said: "As mothers and other consumers are very concerned (about radiation), we want to carry out regular tests", Test done by the government in July and August 2011 on 25 baby products did not reveal any contamination.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (10 December 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111209p2g00m0dm174000c.html Meiji ignored info on cesium-tainted baby food for 2 weeks]</ref>

====Children====
In a survey by the local and central governments conducted on 1,080 children aged 0 to 15 in Iwaki, Kawamata and Iitate on 26<U+2013>30 March, almost 45 percent of these children had experienced [[thyroid]] exposure to radiation with radioactive [[iodine]], although in all cases the amounts of radiation did not warrant further examination, according to the [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission|Nuclear Safety Commission]] on Tuesday 5 July. In October 2011, [[hormone|hormonal]] irregularies in 10 evacuated children were reported. However, the organization responsible for the study said that no link had been established between the children's condition and explosure to radiation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111004p2g00m0dm116000c.html |title=Thyroid gland irregularities found in young evacuees from Fukushima |publisher=The Manichi Daily News |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>

On 9 October a survey started in the prefecture Fukushima: ultrasonic examinations were done of the thyroid glands of all 360.000 children between 0 to 18 years of age. Follow-up tests will be done for the rest of their lives. This was done in response to concerned parents, alarmed by the evidence showing increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The project was done by the Medical University of Fukushima.<ref>Kyodo-news(9 October 2011)[http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/10/119366.html Fukushima children start undergoing lifelong thyroid examinations]</ref> The results of the tests will be mailed to the children within a month. At the end of 2014 the initial testing of all children should be completed, after this the children will undergo a thyroid checkup every 2 years until they turn 20, and once every 5 years above that age.<ref>JIAF(9 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318217190P.pdf Earthuake-report 230: Thyroid checkups begin for Fukushima children]</ref>

In November 2011 in urine-samples of 1500 pre-school-children (ages 6 years or younger) from the city of [[Minamisoma]] in the prefecture Fukushima radioactive cesium was found in 104 cases. Most had levels between 20 and 30 becquerels per liter, just above the detection limit, but 187 becquerels was found in the urine of a one-year-old baby boy. All was done because the parents were afraid for internal exposure. Local governments only covered the tests for elementary schoolchildren and older students. According to RHC JAPAN a medical consultancy firm in Tokyo, these levels could not harm the health of the children. But director Makoto Akashi of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences said, that although those test results should be verified, this still proved the possibility of internal exposure in the children of Fukushima, but that the internal exposure would not increase, when all food was tested for radioactivity before consumption.<ref>NHK-world (5 November 2011) [http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/05_07.html  Radioactivity in Fukushima children's urine]</ref><ref>JAIF (5 November 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1320469975P.pdf Earthquake-report 256]</ref>

====Soil====
Also in July citizens groups reported that a survey of soil at four places in the city of Fukushima taken on 26 June proved that all samples were contaminated with radioactive caesium, measuring 16,000 to 46,000 becquerels per kilogram and exceeding the legal limit of 10,000 becquerels per kg,<ref>''Kyodo-news'' (5 July 2011) [http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/07/101083.html 45% of kids in Fukushima survey had thyroid exposure to radiation]</ref> A study published by the [[PNAS]] found that [[cesium 137]] had 'strongly contaminated the soils in large areas of eastern and northeastern Japan'<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward Calabrese |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/11/1112058108 |title=Cesium-137 deposition and contamination of Japanese soils due to the Fukushima nuclear accident |publisher=Pnas.org |date= |accessdate=27 June 2012}}</ref>

====Wildlife====
After the find of 28,000 [[becquerel]]s of [[caesium]] per kilogram in wild [[mushroom]]s, and a [[wild boar]] that was found with radiation amounts about 6 times the safety limit, Professor Yasuyuki Muramatsu at the [[Gakushuin University]] urged detailed checks on wild plants and animals. Radioactive caesium in soil and fallen leaves in forests in his opinion would be easily absorbed by mushrooms and edible plants. He said that wild animals like boars were bound to accumulate high levels of radiation by eating contaminated mushrooms and plants. The professor added that detailed studies were needed on wild plants and animals. Across Europe the [[Chernobyl]]-incident had likewise effects on wild fauna and flora.<ref>JAIF (12 September 2011) [http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1315808560P.pdf Earthquake report 202: Radiation checks on wild plants, animals urged]</ref>
The first study of the effects of radioactive contamination following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster demonstrated through standard point count censuses that the abundance of birds was negatively correlated with radioactive contamination, and that among the 14 species in common between the Fukushima and the Chernobyl regions, the decline in abundance was steeper in Fukushima.<ref>

About a year after the nuclear disaster scientists found mutated butterflies. This was an unexpected finding, as they believe <U+201C>insects are very resistant to radiation.<U+201D> Since these are recent findings, the study suggests that these mutations have been passed down from older generations. Additionally, they found radioactive fish, such as tuna, in Japanese waters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57492524/report-mutated-butterflies-found-near-fukushima/ |author=CBS News |title=Report: Mutated butterflies found near Fukushima |date=August 13, 2012.}}</ref>

====Plankton====
Radioactive cesium was found in high concentration in plankton in the sea near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Samples were taken up to 60 kilometers from the coast of [[Iwaki, Fukushima|Iwaki]] city in July 2011 by scientists of the [[Tokyo University]] of Marine Science and Technology. Up to 669 becquerels per kilogram of radioactive cesium was measured in samples of animal plankton taken 3 kilometers offshore. The leader of the research-group Professor Takashi Ishimaru, said that the sea current continuously carried contaminated water southwards from the plant. Further studies to determine the effect on the food-chain and fish would be needed.<ref>JAIF (15 October 2011)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1318651768P.pdf  Earthquake-report 235: Radioactive cesium found in plankton off the nuclear plant]</ref>

====Building materials====
Detectable levels of radiation were found in an apartment building in [[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima]], where the foundation was made using concrete containing crushed stone collected from a quarry near the troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, situated inside the evacuation-zone.

In the first weeks of February 2012 up to 214,200 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram was measured in samples gravel in the quarry near Namie, situated inside the evacuation zone. The gravel stored outsite showed about 60,000<U+2013>210,000 becquerels of cesium in most samples. From the 25 quarries in the evacuation zones, up to 122,400 becquerels of radioactive cesium was found at one that has been closed since the nuclear crisis broke out on 11 March 2011. In one quarry, that is still operational 5,170 becquerels  per kilogram was found. Inspections were done at some 150 of the 1.100 construction sites, where the gravel form the Namie-quarry was supected to be used. At 27 locations the radioation levels were higher than the surrounding area.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (16 February 2012)[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20120216p2a00m0na006000c.html Massive levels of radioactive cesium detected at quarry near Fukushima plant]</ref>

===Hot spots at school-yards===
On 6 May 2012 it became known that according to documents of the municipal education board reports submitted by each school in Fukushima prefecture in April at least  14 elementary schools, 7 junior high and 5 nursery schools so called "hot spots" existed, where the radiation exposure was more than 3.8 microsieverts per hour, resulting in an annual cummulative dose above 20 millisieverts. However all restrictions, that limited the maximum time to three hours for the children to play outside at the playgrounds of the schools, were lifted at the beginning of the new academic year in April by the education board. The documents were obtained by a group of civilians after a formal request to disclose the information. Tokiko Noguchi, the foreman of a group of civilians, insisted that the education board would restore the restrictions.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (7 May 2012)[http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120507p2g00m0dm041000c.html 'Hot spots' detected at more than 20 schools in Koriyama]</ref>

====New radiation limits for food in Japan====
On 22 December 2011 the Japanese government announced new limits for radioactive cesium in food. The new norms would be enforced in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nakamura|first=Tsuyoshi|title=New radiation limits alarm local entities|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T111224002468.htm|publisher=Daily Yomiuri Online|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

On 31 March 2012 the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan published a report on radioactive cesium found in food. Between January and around 15 March 2012 at 421 occasions food was found containing more than 100 becquerels per kilogram cesium. All was found within 8 prefectures: [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] (285 finds), [[Gunma Prefecture|Gunma]], [[Ibaraki prefecture|Ibaraki]] (36 finds), [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], [[Tochigi Prefecture|Tochigi]] (29 finds) and [[Yamagata prefecture|Yamagata]]. Most times it involved fish: landlocked salmon and flounder, seafood, after this: Shiitake-mushrooms or the meat of wild animals.<ref>The Mainichi Shimbun (1 April 2012) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20120401p2g00m0dm012000c.html Foods with excessive radiation under new rule found in 8 prefectures]</ref><ref>NHK-world (1 April 2012)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/20120401_12.html Government tightens control over cesium in food]</ref>

In the first week of April 2012 cesium-contamination above legal limits was found in:
* Shiitake mushrooms in [[Manazuru]] [[Kanagawa prefecture]] situated at 300 kilometers from Fukushima: 141 becquerels/kg
* bamboo-shoots in two cities in [[Chiba prefecture]]
* bamboo-shoots and Shiitake-mushrooms in 5 cities in the region [[Kant<U+014D> region|Kant<U+014D>]], [[Ibaraki prefecture]]
In [[Gunma]] prefecture 106 becquerels/kg was found in beef. Sharper limits for meat would be taken effect in October 2012, but in order to ease consumer concern the farmers were asked to refrain from shipping.<ref>JAIF (8 April 2012)[http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1333857057P.pdf Earthquake-report 397: Radioactive cesium found in farm goods near Tokyo]</ref>

==Decontamination efforts==
In the last week of August premier minister Naoto Kan informed the governor of Fukushima Prefecture about the plans to build a central storage facility to store and treat nuclear waste including contaminated soil in Fukushima. On 27 August at a meeting in Fukushima City Governor Yuhei Sato spoke out his concern about the sudden proposals, and the implications that this would have for the prefecture and its inhabitants, that already had endured so much from the nuclear accident.

===Distribution by sea===
Seawater containing measurable levels of iodine-131 and caesium-137 were collected by Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) on 22<U+2013>23 March at several points 30&nbsp;km from the coastline iodine concentrations were "at or above Japanese regulatory limits" while caesium was "well below those limits" according to an IAEA report on 24 March.<ref name=IAEAiodine/> On 25 March, IAEA indicated that in the long term, caesium-137 (with a half-life of 30 years) would be the most relevant isotope as far as doses was concerned and indicated the possibility "to follow this nuclide over long distances for several years." The organization also said it could take months or years for the isotope to reach "other shores of the Pacific".<ref name=IAEAiodine/>
The survey by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) reveals that radioactive cesium released from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant reached the ocean 2000 kilometers from the plant and 5000 meters deep one month after the accident. It is considered that airborne cesium particles fell on the ocean surface, and sank as they were attached to the bodies of dead plankton. The survey result was announced in a symposium held on 20 November in Tokyo. From  18 to 30 April, JAMSTEC collected "marine snow", sub-millimeter particles made mostly of dead plankton and sand, off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, 2000 kilometers away from Fukushima, and off the coast of Ogasawara Islands, 1000 kilometers away, at 5000 meters below the ocean surface. The Agency detected radioactive cesium in both locations, and from the ratio of cesium-137 and cesium-134 and other observations it was determined that it was from Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. The density of radioactive cesium is still being analyzed, according to the Agency. It has been thus confirmed that radioactive materials in the ocean are moving and spreading not just by ocean currents but by various other means.

Due to an [[anticyclone]] south of Japan{{Verify source|date=May 2011}}, favorable westerly winds were dominant during most of the first week of the accident, depositing most of the radioactive material out to sea and away from population centers, with some unfavorable wind directions depositing radioactive material over Tokyo.

==Isotopes of concern==
{{see also|Nuclear fission product#Countermeasures against the worst fission products found in incident fallout}}
The isotope [[iodine-131]] is easily absorbed by the [[thyroid]]. Persons exposed to releases of I-131 from any source have a higher risk for developing [[thyroid cancer]] or thyroid disease, or both. Iodine-131 has a short [[half-life]] at approximately 8 days, and therefore is an issue mostly in the first weeks after the incident. Children are more vulnerable to I-131 than adults. Increased risk for thyroid [[neoplasm]] remains elevated for at least 40 years after exposure. [[Potassium iodide]] tablets prevent iodine-131 absorption by saturating the thyroid with non-radioactive iodine.<ref name=Atsdr1>{{cite web |title=Radiation Exposure from Iodine 131: Physiologic Effects |publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |location=United States |date=5 November 2002 |url=

[[Caesium-137]] is also a particular threat because it behaves like [[potassium]] and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-137#Radioactive_caesium_in_the_environment Radioactive caesium in the environment

Wikipedia</ref>  Cs-137 can cause acute [[radiation sickness]], and increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk.<ref name=CDC1>{{cite web |title=Radioisotope Brief: Cesium-137 (Cs-137) |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |location=United States |date=18 August 2004 |url=
