The '''Walkman Bean''' was a [[flash memory]]-based [[MP3 player]] by [[Sony]]. The name refers to its shape, which was modelled after a [[jellybean]], and its ancestor, the original [[Sony Walkman]] portable [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] player. The Bean has recently ceased production. [http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/16/sony-kills-walkman-bean-after-failure-to-sprout]

The player was available in three versions: the basic model with 512MB capacity (model NW-E205), the basic model with an inbuilt FM radio (model NW-E305), and a higher-capacity 1GB model (model NW-E307). It was also available in four colours, named after jellybean [[flavour]]s -  Tropical Ice (blue), Cotton Candy (pink), Licorice (black) and Coconut (white).

The Walkman Bean featured a 'pop-out' USB port for file transfer. One of its major selling points was the battery's fast charge speeds - Sony claims that one can "charge it for 3 minutes to get 3 hours<U+2019> playback from it". Sony claimed that a fully charged Bean playing Sony's own [[audio data compression|compressed audio]] format, [[ATRAC]], can operate for 50 hours, or 40 hours for audio compressed as [[MP3]].
