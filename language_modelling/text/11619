The '''Hall PH''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[flying boat]] of the 1930s.  A twin engined [[biplane]] which developed from the [[Naval Aircraft Factory PN]] and could hence trace its lineage back to the [[Felixstowe F.5|Felixstowe]] flying boats of the [[World War 1|First World War]], the PH was purchased in small numbers by the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]].  It remained in service with the Coast Guard until 1944, being used for anti submarine and search and rescue duties. 
==Development and design==
In December 1927, the U.S. Navy placed a contract with the Hall Aluminium Aircraft Corporation of [[Bristol, Pennsylvania]] for a developed version of the [[Naval Aircraft Factory PN|Naval Aircraft Factory PN-11]],<ref name="swan navyp254"> Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p.254.</ref> which itself could trace a development history back to the [[Felixstowe F.5]] flying boat of the [[World War 1|First World War]].<ref name="donald american p186"> Donald 1995, p. 186.</ref> The resultant prototype, the '''XPH-1''', first flew in December 1929.<ref name="Greenv5p175"> Green 1962, p.175.</ref>

The XPH-1 had identical wings and a similar metal hull to that of the PN-11, but was fitted with a large single fin and [[rudder]].  It was powered by two [[Wright Cyclone]] [[radial engine]]s and accomodated its two pilots side by side in an open [[cockpit]], with cockpits for gunners in the nose and behind the wings.<ref name="swan navyp254"/>  

In 1930, Hall received an order for nine production aircraft from the U.S Navy, designated the '''PH-1''', which were fitted with more powerful engines and a primitive, partly enclosed cockpit for the pilots.<ref name="DANAS v2p677"> Roberts 2000, p.677.</ref>  Orders for the U.S Coast Guard eventually followed, with seven '''PH-2'''s (similar to the PH-1, but with armament removed, and seven '''PH-3'''s (with armament re-instated and a more refined, fully enclosed cockpit for the pilots).<ref name="swan navyp254"/> 

==Operational history==
Delivery of the PH-1 commenced in October 1931,<ref name="swan navyp254"/> equiping VP-8 from 1932, operating from the seaplane tender [[USS Wright (AV-1)|USS ''Wright'']] and from bases at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Midway Atoll|Midway]] and the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. It was replaced by the [[PBY Catalina|Consolidated PBY-1]] in 1937.<ref name="DANAS v2p116"> Roberts 2000, p.116.</ref>

Production of the PH recommenced in June 1936 to meet an order for seven PH-2s for the US Coast Guard.<ref name="swan navyp254"/>  These entered service from 1938, being the largest aircraft operated by the Coast Guard at that time.<ref name="USCG PH"/>  The Coast Guard ordered a further seven of an improved version, the PH-3 in 1939, these entering service in 1941.<ref name="USCG PH"/> 

The Hall flying boats were used by the Coast Guard for [[search and rescue]] duties and were fitted with specialised equipment to aid them in this role.  Following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack on Pearl Harbour]] and the United States entry into World War II, the remaining PHs were painted in U.S Navy Grey Green colours to replace the previous bare metal finish, armed, and used for anti-[[submarine]] patrols (particularly during the [[Second Happy Time|Operation Drumbeat]] [[U-boat]] attacks off the East coast of the United States in 1942) as well as continuing search and rescue operations.<ref name="USCG PH"/>  The Coast Guard continued operating the PH-2 and -3 until 1944.<ref name="USCG PH"/>
