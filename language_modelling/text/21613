'''General Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc<U+00ED>a''' (b. [[San Juan Chamelco]], [[Alta Verapaz]], 4 July 1924 <U+2013> d. [[Puerto la Cruz]], [[Venezuela]], 27 May 2006) was the 25th [[President of Guatemala|President]] of [[Guatemala]] from 1 July 1978 to 23 March 1982. He was democratically elected as [[Institutional Democratic Party]] candidate (with the support of the [[Revolutionary Party (Guatemala)|Revolutionary Party]]). Elections for his presidency were fraud ridden and most poor peasants in Guatemala opposed his oppressive regime.

Whereas under the previous administration the human rights situation in Guatemala had improved, the regime of Lucas Garcia brought the repression to the much the same level observed during the "State of Siege" period under former President [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio|Arana Osorio]] (1970-1974).{{sfn|Amnesty International|1979|p=63}} The election of Lucas Garcia was followed by an increase in the [[extrajudicial killing]], torture and "disappearances" of trade unionists, academics, lawyers, ''campesinos'', and religious leaders. Some of the more infamous cases included the assassinations of former progressive Mayor [[Manuel Colom Argueta|Manuel Colom]] and Social Democrat Party founder [[Alberto Fuentes Mohr|Alberto Fuentes]] (both in 1979). Together with the government in neighboring El Salvador, the Lucas Garcia regime was cited as the worst human rights violator in the western hemisphere. The daily number of killings by government forces and officially-sanctioned death squads increased from an average of 20 to 30 in 1979 to a conservative estimate of 30 to 40 in 1980. An estimated 5,000 civilians were killed by government forces in Guatemala in 1980.<ref>"Guatemala and El Salvador: Latin America's worst human rights violators in 1980" The Council on Hemispheric Affairs</ref> In 1981 the number of killings and assassinations by government forces exceeded 9,000.<ref>Handy 1984, 180.{{full|date=May 2013}}</ref> He was president during [[Spanish embassy fire]] in [[Guatemala City]] on 31 January 1980, in which 37 people died. His [[Vice President of Guatemala|vice president]], [[Francisco Villagr<U+00E1>n Kramer|Francisco Villagr<U+00E1>n]], resigned on 1 September 1980, citing differences with Lucas and disapproval of the country's worsening human rights situation.

The United States, Israel and Argentina all provided military support to the regime in the form of pipeline aid, sales, credits, training and counterinsurgency advisors. Between FS 1978 and FS 1980, the U.S. provided $8.5 million in military assistance, mostly [[Foreign military sales|FMS]] credit sales, and approximately $1.8 million in export licensing for commercial arms sales, despite a 1977 congressional prohibition on military aid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/guatemala/social-consequences-development-aid-guatemala |title=The Social Consequences of "Development" Aid in Guatemala |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> In 1980 and 1981, the United States also delivered three [[Bell 212]] and six [[Bell 412]] helicopters worth $10.5 million to the army.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Fried |editor1-first=Jonathan L. |editor2-last=Gettleman |editor2-first=Marvin E. |editor3-last=Levenson |editor3-first=Deborah T. |editor4-last=Peckenham |editor4-first=Nancy |year=1983 |title=Guatemala in Rebellion: Unfinished History |location=New York |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0394532406 }}</ref> In June 1981 the Reagan Administration announced a $3.2 million delivery of 150 military trucks and jeeps to the army, justifying these shipments by blaming the guerrillas for the violence perpetrated against civilians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/montt.html |title=Efra<U+00ED>n R<U+00ED>os Montt killer file |publisher=Moreorless.au.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

In its later years, Lucas Garcia's regime was perceived as a threat by the military establishment in Guatemala, as it engaged in actions which compromised the legitimacy of the Guatemalan military with both the populace and within its own ranks, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the counterinsurgency war.<ref>McCleary, 1999; 46.{{full|date=May 2013}}</ref> In the 1982 elections, Lucas Garcia went against both popular opinion and the military's interests through his endorsement of [[Angel Anibal Guevara]], his own defense minister. In response to these pressures, junior military officers staged a preventative [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] on March 23, 1982, an act which the United States was neither complicit with nor had even foreseen.{{sfn|Garrard-Burnett|2010|p=152}} Later that day, the military officers handed power to General [[Efrain Rios Montt]].

In 1999 the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain]] began criminal proceedings for accusations of [[torture]] and [[genocide]] against the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population after a formal petition introduced by [[Rigoberta Mench<U+00FA>]]. However, the [[Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal]] denied the extradition on 22 June 2005, arguing that the required evidence was not presented and lifted the house arrest.

He died in exile in [[Puerto la Cruz]], [[Venezuela]], where he had lived for 12 years with his wife Elsa Cirigliano, suffering from [[Alzheimer]]s and various other ailments, at the age of 81.{{sfn|El Nacional|2006|p=A-13}}{{sfn|BBC|2006|p=}}{{sfn|The New York Times|2006|p=}}
