[[Mumbai]] (formerly Bombay) is the financial capital of [[India]] and one of the most [[List of cities proper by population|populous cities in the world]]. In place of the present day city was an archipelago of [[seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]]. Between the 3nd century BCE and 1348, the islands came under the control of successive [[Hindu]] dynasties. The Muslim rulers of [[Gujarat]] annexed the islands in 1348, which were later governed by the [[Gujarat Sultanate]] from 1391 to 1534. Growing apprehensive of the power of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Humayun]], [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat|Sultan Bahadur Shah]] of the Gujarat Sultanate was obliged to sign the [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)|Treaty of Bassein]] with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the seven islands of Bombay and the strategic town of [[Vasai|Bassein]], near Bombay, and  its dependencies, were offered to the Portuguese, which were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.

The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their [[Roman Catholic]] religious orders in Bombay. They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form ''Bombaim''. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese [[Franciscans]] and [[Jesuits]] built several churches in the city, prominent being the [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)|St. Michael Church]] at [[Mahim]], [[St. John the Baptist Church, Mumbai|St. John the Baptist Church]] at [[Andheri]], and [[St. Andrew's Church (Mumbai)|St. Andrew's Church]] at [[Bandra]]. The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the [[Bombay Castle]], ''[[Castella de Aguada]]'' (Bandra Fort), [[Dongri Fort]], and [[Madh Fort]]. The [[British Empire|British]] were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Bombay, as they recognized its  excellent harbour and its natural isolation from land-attack.

By the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the [[Dutch Empire]] forced the [[British Empire|British]] to acquire a station in western India. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of [[Charles II of England]] and [[Catherine of Braganza]], daughter of [[John IV of Portugal|King John IV of Portugal]], placed Bombay in the possession of the British Empire, as part of the dowry of Catherine to Charles. Even after the treaty, some villages in Bombay still remained under Portuguese possession, but were later acquired by the British slowly, permanently ending the Portuguese presence in Bombay.

In place of the present day city was an archipelago of [[seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]]: [[Isle of Bombay|Bombay Island]] (''Bombaim''), [[Parel]], [[Mazagaon]], [[Mahim]], [[Colaba]], [[Worli]], and [[Old Woman's Island]] (also known as ''Little Colaba'').<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|loc=Seven Islands of Bombay, pp. 4-5|Ref=bom}}</ref> The [[Salsette Island|Salsette]] group of islands were located west of Bombay, separated by the [[Mahim Bay]].<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|loc=Salsette group of islands, p. 5|Ref=bom}}</ref> Important strategic towns located near Bombay were; [[Vasai|Bassein]] (''Ba<U+00E7>aim'') to the north, [[Thane]] to the east, and [[Chaul]] to the south.

==Accession of Bombay to the Portuguese==
{{main|Mughal Empire|Treaty of Bassein (1534)}}
[[File:Humayun.jpg|right|thumb|[[Humayun]]]]
The [[Mughal Empire]], founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the mid-16th century. The dynasty was founded when [[Babur]], hailing from [[Ferghana]] (in modern day [[Uzbekistan]]), invaded parts of [[North India]] and defeated [[Lodhi dynasty|Ibrahim Shah Lodhi]], the ruler of Delhi, at the [[First battle of Panipat|First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526. The Mughal Empire superseded the [[Delhi Sultanate]] as rulers of northern India. In time, the state thus founded by Babur far exceeded the bounds of the Delhi Sultanate, eventually encompassing a major portion of India and earning the appellation of the empire. After Babur's death, his son [[Humayun]] (1530-40) ascended to the throne.<ref>{{cite web

Sultan Bahadur Shah had grown apprehensive of the power of Humayun. He despatched his chief officer Xacoes (Shah Khawjeh) to Nuno da Cunha with an offer to hand over the seven islands of Bomaby together with Bassein, its dependencies, and revenues by sea and land. On 23 December 1534, the [[Treaty of Bassein (1534)|Treaty of Bassein]] was signed on board the galleon ''San Mateos''.<ref>{{harvnb|Da Cunha|1993|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=miD5YO05jpUC&printsec=frontcover#PPA88,M1 88]|Ref=ger}}</ref> Bassein and the seven islands of Bombay were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Bombay.<ref name="p166"/>

[[File:Madh-fort3.jpg|thumb|The [[Madh Fort]] built by the Portuguese, was one of the most important forts in [[Salsette]]]]
Garcia da Orta was responsible for the building of the manor-house in Bombay. He also mentioned several accounts of the islands and the people living in Bombay during his time. During his regime, as regards the population of the island, Bombay was composed of seven villages subordinate to two ''cacabas'' (''kashas'') or chief stations, at which customs-duty was levied. These villages were ''Mahim'', ''Parel'', ''Varella'' ([[Wadala]]) and ''Syva'' ([[Sion, Mumbai|Sion]]) under the ''kasba'' (chief officer) of Mahim, and ''Mazagaon'', ''Bombaim'' (Bombay), and ''Varel'' ([[Worli]]) under the ''kasba'' (chief officer) of Bombay. In addition to these, there were smaller hamlets like Cavel, [[Colaba]], [[Naigaon]] and [[Dongri]], which had existed from the epoch of Hindu colonization. The [[Koli]]s, a fishing community, formed the most numerous class of people, and dwelt in most parts of Bombay from Colaba in the south to Sion and Mahim in the north. Other Hindu communities residing were, the ''Kunbis'' and ''Agris'' (Curumbins) (who cultivated the fields and sowed them with rice and all sorts of pulse), the ''Malis'' (who tended the orchards), and the Piaes (men-at-arms) (who were [[Bhandari]]s). The Parus (Prabhus) dwelt in Mahim, Bombay, and Parel. They collected the rents of the King and of the inhabitants and their estates, and were also merchants. The Muslim [[Moors]] in Bombay were solely engaged in maritime trade. A few Muslims of less mixed descent were living in Mahim, but the bulk of the followers of Islam belonged to the [[Konkani Muslims|Konkani Muslim]] community. Christians residing in Bombay during his time included eleven Roman Catholic Portuguese families of married men. The other three communities mentioned by Orta as residents in Bassein and its surrounding tracts were ''Baneanes'' ([[Banias]]), ''Coaris'' or ''Esparcis'' ([[Parsis]]), and ''Deres'' (Dheds or Mahars) or Farazes. The Banias and Parsis did not actually settle in Bombay until after its cession to England by the Portuguese.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=168-9|Ref=bom}}</ref> Bombay apparently remained in Orta's possession until his death in Goa in 1570, after which it appears to have been granted on the same tenure to several parties in succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|pp=167-8|Ref=bom}}</ref>
