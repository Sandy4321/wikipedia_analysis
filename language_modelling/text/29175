'''USS ''New Jersey'' (BB-62)''', ("Big J" or "Black Dragon") is an [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] [[battleship]], and was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. Among the four completed ''Iowa''-class battleships ''New Jersey'' is notable for having earned the most [[battle star]]s for her combat actions, and for being the only battleship of the class to have served a tour of duty in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]].

During [[World War II]] the ''New Jersey'' shelled targets on [[Guam]] and [[Okinawa]], and screened aircraft carriers conducting raids in the [[Marshall islands]]. During the [[Korean War]] she was involved in raids up and down the [[North Korea]]n coast, after which she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in to the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the "mothball fleet". She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to [[Vietnam]] to support U.S. troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969. Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] program, ''New Jersey'' was modernized to carry missiles and recomissioned for service. In 1983, she participated in U.S. operations during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].

''New Jersey'' was decommissioned for the last time in 1991, having earned a [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for service in Vietnam and a total of 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Lebanese Civil War, and service in the [[Persian Gulf]], and is now a [[museum ship]] at [[Camden, New Jersey]]. 

==Construction==
{{main|Iowa class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}
''New Jersey'' was one of the [[Iowa class battleship|''Iowa''-class]] "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[12 December]] [[1942]] and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[23 May]] [[1943]]. The ship was the second of the ''Iowa'' class to be commissioned by the [[US Navy]].<ref name="Order">{{cite web | title = Naval Vessel Register | url = http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB62.htm | publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> The ship was christened at her launching by Mrs. Edison, wife of [[Governor]] [[Charles Edison]] of New Jersey, himself a former [[Secretary of the Navy]]; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[Philadelphia]] [[23 May]] [[1943]], Captain Carl F. Holden in command.<ref name="DANFS">{{cite web | title = USS New Jersey (BB 62) History | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n4/new_jersey-ii.htm | work = [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] | publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>

''New Jersey''<U+2019>s main battery consisted of nine [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]]s, which could hurl 2,700 lbs armor piercing shells some 24 miles. Her secondary battery consisted of ten [[5"/38 caliber gun]]s, which could fire at targets up to 9 miles away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, ''New Jersey'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1968 ''New Jersey'' had her 40&nbsp;mm AA guns removed and was tailored for use as a heavy bombardment ship. When reactivated in 1982 ''New Jersey'' had her remaining 20&nbsp;mm guns removed and was outfitted with [[Phalanx CIWS]] mounts for protection against missiles and aircraft, and [[Armored Box Launcher]]s and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire [[Tomahawk missile]]s and [[Harpoon missile]]s, respectively.<ref name="The Battleships I">{{cite book  | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =page 120 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref>

Unlike the other ''Iowa''-class battleships, ''New Jersey'' was named by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to repay a political debt to then New Jersey Goverener Charles Edison. During his time in the Navy department, Edison advocated construction of the large ''Iowa''-class battleships, and that one of them be built at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], which secured votes for Roosevelt in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]]; in return, Roosevelt had BB-62 named ''New Jersey''.<ref>Comegno, Carol.

== World War II (1944<U+2013>1945) ==
===Shakedown and Service with the 5th Fleet, Admiral Spruance===
''New Jersey'' completed fitting out and trained her initial crew in the Western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Caribbean]]. On [[7 January]] [[1944]] she passed through the [[Panama Canal]] war-bound for [[Funafuti]], [[Ellice Islands]]. She reported there [[22 January]] for duty with the [[United States Fifth Fleet]], and three days later rendezvoused with [[Task Group 58.2]] for the [[Marshall Islands campaign|assault on the Marshall Islands]]. ''New Jersey'' screened the [[aircraft carrier]]s from [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] attack as planes from Task Group 58.2 flew strikes against [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] [[29 January]]<U+2013>[[2 February]], softening up the latter for its invasion and supporting the troops who landed [[31 January]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' began her career as a [[flagship]] [[4 February]] in [[Majuro]] [[Lagoon]] when [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Raymond A. Spruance]], commanding the 5th Fleet, broke his flag from her main. Her first action as a flagship was in [[Operation Hailstone]], a two-day surface and air strike by her task force against the major [[Japan]]ese fleet base on [[Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. This attack was coordinated with the assault on Kwajalein, and effectively interdicted the Japanese naval retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls. On [[17 February]] and [[18 February]], the task force accounted for two Japanese [[light cruiser]]s, four [[destroyer]]s, three [[auxiliary cruiser]]s, two [[submarine tender]]s, two [[submarine chaser]]s, an armed [[trawler]], a plane ferry, and 23 other auxiliaries, not including small craft. ''New Jersey'' destroyed a trawler and, with other ships, sank the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Maikaze|''Maikaze'']], as well as fired on an enemy aircraft that attacked her formation. The task force returned to the Marshalls [[19 February]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

Between [[17 March]] and [[10 April]], ''New Jersey'' first sailed with [[Rear Admiral]] [[Marc A. Mitscher]]'s flagship [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|USS ''Lexington'']] (CV-16) for an air and surface bombardment of [[Mille]], then rejoined Task Group 58.2 for a strike against shipping in the [[Palaus]], and bombarded [[Woleai]]. Upon his return to [[Majuro]], Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']] (CA-35).<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'''s next war cruise, [[13 April]]<U+2013>[[4 May]] [[1944]], began and ended at Majuro. She screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the invasion of [[Aitape]], [[Tanahmerah Bay]] and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]], [[New Guinea]], [[22 April]], then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk [[29 April]]<U+2013>[[30 April]]. ''New Jersey'' and her formation shot down two enemy [[torpedo bomber]]s at Truk. Her 16&nbsp;inch salvos pounded [[Ponape]] [[1 May]], destroying [[fuel tank]]s, badly damaging the [[airfield]], and demolishing a [[headquarters]] building.<ref name="DANFS"/>

After rehearsing in the Marshalls for the invasion of the [[Marianas]], ''New Jersey'' put to sea [[6 June]] in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher's Task Force. On the second day of preinvasion air strikes, [[12 June]], ''New Jersey'' shot down an enemy [[torpedo bomber]], and during the next two days her heavy guns battered [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]], in advance of the marine landings on [[15 June]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

The Japanese response to the Marianas operation was an order to its mobile fleet: it must attack and annihilate the American invasion force. Shadowing American [[submarine]]s tracked the Japanese fleet into the [[Philippine Sea]] as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher's to meet the enemy. ''New Jersey'' took station in the protective screen around the carriers on [[19 June]] [[1944]] as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. That day and the next were to pronounce the end of Japanese naval aviation; in this "[[Marianas Turkey Shoot]]", the Japanese lost some 400 planes. This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Taih<U+014D>|''Taih<U+014D>'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh<U+014D>kaku|''Sh<U+014D>kaku'']] by the submarines [[USS Albacore (SS-218)|''Albacore'']] and [[USS Cavalla (SS-244)|''Cavalla'']], respectively, and the loss of [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiy<U+014D>|''Hiy<U+014D>'']] to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier [[USS Belleau Wood (CVL-24)|''Belleau Wood'']]. In addition to these losses, Allied forces succedded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship. The anti-aircraft fire of ''New Jersey'' and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable; two American ships were slightly damaged during the abttle. In this overwhelming victory only 17 American planes were lost to combat.<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Service with the 3rd Fleet, Admiral Halsey===
''New Jersey'''s final contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on [[Guam]] and the [[Palaus]] from which she sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving [[9 August]]. Here she broke the flag of Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]],<ref>William F. Halsey held the rank of a four star Admiral throughout the Second World War. In December of 1945, four monthes after the official surrender of the Japanese, he was promoted to the rank of [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] and awarded his fifth star. {{cite web | url =http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey, Jr. | publisher = Naval Historical Center | date = [[June 2]] [[1996]] |accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> [[24 August]], becoming flagship of the [[United States Third Fleet]]. On [[30 August]] ''New Jersey'' set sail from Pearl Harbor, and for the next eight monthes was based at [[Ulithi]] to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Pilippines. In this span of the Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines, [[Okinawa]], and [[Taiwan|Formosa]], making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.<ref name="DANFS"/> 

In September the targets were in the [[Visayas]] and the southern Philippines, then [[Manila]] and [[Cavite]], [[Panay Island|Panay]], [[Negros]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], and [[Cebu Island|Cebu]]. Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings of [[20 October]] [[1944]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

This invasion brought on the last great [[sortie]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Its plan for the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] included a [[feint]] by a northern force of planeless heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships, cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings. This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At the opening of the battle planes from the carriers guarded by ''New Jersey'' struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces, sinking a battleship [[23 October]]. The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted. Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers, as well as a destroyer and a cruiser, while ''New Jersey'' steamed south at [[flank speed]] to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force. It had been [[Battle off Samar|turned back in a stunning defeat]] when she arrived.<ref name="DANFS"/>

[[Image:USS Intrepid CV-11 kamikaze strike.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A crewman assigned to one of ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s anti-aircraft guns watches helplessly as a Japanese kamikaze pilot prepares to strike [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|''Intrepid'']].]]
''New Jersey'' rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernardino [[27 October]] [[1944]] for strikes on central and southern [[Luzon]]. Two days later, the force came under suicide attack. In a melee of anti-aircraft fire from the ships and combat air patrol, ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane whose pilot maneuvered it into the port gun galleries of [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|USS ''Intrepid'']] (CV-11), while machine gun fire from ''Intrepid'' wounded three of ''New Jersey's'' men. During a similar action [[25 November]] three Japanese planes were shot down by the combined fire of the force, part of one flaming onto the flight deck of [[USS Hancock (CV-19)|USS ''Hancock'']] (CV-19). ''Intrepid'' was again attacked; she shot down one would-be kamikaze aircraft, but was crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by ''New Jersey'' gunners. ''New Jersey'' shot down a plane diving on [[USS Cabot (CVL-28)|USS ''Cabot'']] (CVL-28) and hit another plane which smashed into ''Cabot''<U+2019>s port bow.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On [[18 December]] [[1944]] the ships of Task Force 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force&mdash; seven fleet and six light carriers, eight battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers&mdash; during their attempt to refuel at sea. At the time the ships were operating about 300 miles east of Luzon in the [[Philippine Sea]].<ref name="PT">{{cite web | title = Typhoons and Hurricanes: Pacific Typhoon, 18 December 1944 | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq102-4.htm | |publisher= Department of the Navy -- Navy Historical Center | date =[[April 10]] [[2001]] | accessdate=2006-01-08}}</ref> The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields, suppressing enemy aircraft during the American [[amphibious assault|amphibious operations]] against [[Mindoro]] in the Philippines. The task force rendezvoused with [[Captain]] Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group [[17 December]] with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft.<ref name="Cobra">{{cite web | title = Third Fleet in Typhoon Cobra, December 1944 | url = http://www.compass.dircon.co.uk/cobra2.htm | work = History of US Naval Operations in World War II |publisher = Dave James' homepage | author= Samuel Eliot Morison | accessdate=2006-01-08}}</ref> Although the sea had been growing rougher all day, the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach. Each of the aircraft carriers in the Third Fleet had a weatherman aboard, and as the fleet flagship ''New Jersey'' had a highly experienced one: Commander G. F. Kosco, a graduate of the aerology course at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] who had also studied hurricanes in the [[West Indies]]; despite this, none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon.<ref name="Cobra"/> On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane force winds. Three destroyers, [[USS Hull (DD-350)|''Hull'' (DD-350)]], [[USS Monaghan (DD-354)|''Monaghan'' (DD-354)]], and [[USS Spence (DD-512)|''Spence'' (DD-512)]], capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name="PT"/> Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured. Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires, impact damage, or by being swept overboard.<ref name="Cobra"/> As with the other battleships of TF 38, skillful seamanship brought ''New Jersey'' through the storm largely unscathed. She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be met by [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

===Service with Battleship Division Seven, Admiral Badger===
''New Jersey'' ranged far and wide from [[30 December]] [[1944]] to [[25 January]] [[1945]] on her last cruise as Admiral Halsey's flagship. She guarded the carriers in their strikes on Formosa, Okinawa, and Luzon, on the coast of [[Indo-China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shantou|Swatow]] and [[Amoy]], and again on Formosa and Okinawa. At Ulithi [[27 January]] Admiral Halsey lowered his flag in ''New Jersey'', but it was replaced two days later by that of Rear Admiral [[Oscar C. Badger II]] commanding [[Battleship Division 7]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

In support of the assault on [[Iwo Jima]], ''New Jersey'' screened the [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']] (CV-9) group in air attacks on the island [[19 February]]<U+2013>[[21 February]], and gave the same crucial service for the first major carrier raid on [[Tokyo]] [[25 February]], a raid aimed specifically at aircraft production. During the next two days, Okinawa was attacked from the air by the same striking force.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' was directly engaged in the conquest of [[Okinawa]] from [[14 March]] until [[16 April]]. As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on [[Honsh<U+016B>]], ''New Jersey'' fought off air raids, used her [[seaplane]]s to rescue downed pilots, defended the carriers from suicide planes, shooting down at least three and assisting in the destruction of others. On [[24 March]] [[1945]] she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment, preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later.<ref name="DANFS"/>

During the final months of the war, ''New Jersey'' was overhauled at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], from which she sailed [[4 July]] for [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok bound for Guam. Here on [[14 August]] she once again became flagship of the 5th Fleet under Admiral Spruance. Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in [[Tokyo Bay]] [[17 September]], where she served as flagship for the successive commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved [[28 January]] [[1946]] by [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|USS ''Iowa'']] (BB-61). As part of the ongoing [[Operation Magic Carpet (World War II)|Operation Magic Carpet]] ''New Jersey'' took aboard nearly a thousand homeward-bound troops with whom she arrived at [[San Fransisco, California|San Francisco]] [[10 February]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

== Post WWII (1946<U+2013>1950) ==
[[Image:New Jesery Mothballed (1948).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''New Jersey'' photographed shortly after her 1948 decommissioning. The "[[igloo]]"-like domes on the ship were placed over her anti-aircraft guns as protection from the elements.]]
After west coast operations and a normal overhaul at Puget Sound, ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s keel once more cut the Atlantic as she came home to [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], for a rousing fourth birthday party [[23 May]] [[1947]]. Present were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll, former Governor Walter E. Edge and other dignitaries.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Between [[7 June]] and [[26 August]], ''New Jersey'' formed part of the first training squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of [[World War II]]. Over two thousand [[United States Naval Academy]] and [[NROTC]] midshipmen received sea-going experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connoly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in ''New Jersey'' at [[Rosyth]], [[Scotland]] [[23 June]]. She was the scene of official receptions at [[Oslo]], where King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] inspected the crew [[2 July]], and at [[Portsmouth]], [[England]]. The training fleet was westward bound [[18 July]] for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic.<ref name="DANFS"/>

After serving at [[New York City|New York]] as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McClean, Commander, Battleship Division 1, [[12 September]]<U+2013>[[18 October]], ''New Jersey'' was inactivated at the [[New York Naval Shipyard]]. She was decommissioned at Bayonne [[30 June]] [[1948]] and assigned to the New York Group, [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

== The Korean War (1950<U+2013>1953)==
In 1950 [[North Korea]] [[Korean War|invaded]] [[South Korea]], prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the [[United Nations]]. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] was caught off guard when the invasion struck,<ref>American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] had told Congress on [[June 20]] that no war was likely.</ref> but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization ''New Jersey'' was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborn artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. ''New Jersey'' was recommissioned at Bayonne [[21 November]] [[1950]], Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the [[Korean War]]. She sailed from [[Norfolk, Virginia]] [[16 April]] [[1951]] and arrived from Japan off the east coast of [[Korea]] [[17 May]]. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], placed his flag in ''New Jersey'' for the next six months.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey''<U+2019>s guns opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean career at [[Wonsan]] [[20 May]]. During her two tours of duty in Korean waters, she was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery. In direct support to [[United Nations]] troops; or in preparation for ground actions, in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes, or in destroying supplies and troop positions, ''New Jersey'' used her 16&nbsp;in guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery, moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another, and at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection. It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War. One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a [[artillery battery|shore battery]] on her number one turret and received a near miss [[aft]] to [[port]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

[[Image:New Jersey in Korea.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''New Jersey'' opens up on communist targets near the 38th parallel.]]
Between [[23 May]] and [[27 May]] and again [[30 May]] [[1951]], ''New Jersey'' pounded targets near [[Yangyang County|Yangyang]] and [[Kansong]], dispersing troop concentrations, dropping a [[Span (architecture)|bridge span]], and destroying three large [[ammunition dump]]s. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action, while [[railroad]] facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On [[24 May]], she lost one of her [[helicopter]]s after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.<ref name="DANFS"/>

With Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet, and Vice Admiral [[C. Turner Joy]], Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard, ''New Jersey'' bombarded targets at Wonsan [[4 June]]. At Kansong two days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment and truck encampment, with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes. On [[28 July]] off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries. Several near misses splashed to port, but ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s precision fire silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Between [[4 July]] and [[12 July]], ''New Jersey'' supported a United Nations push in the Kansong area, firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions. As the [[Republic of Korea]]'s First Division hurled itself on the enemy, shore fire control observers saw ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s salvos hit directly on enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] emplacements, supply and ammunition dumps, and personnel concentrations. ''New Jersey'' returned to Wonsan [[18 July]] for an exhibition of perfect firing: five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' sailed to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more [[17 August]], returning to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night, and broke up counterattacks by day, inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops. She returned to this general area yet again [[29 August]], when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the [[Changjon]] area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings; destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Aside from a brief break in firing [[23 September]] to take aboard wounded from the [[Korean frigate Apnok (PF-62)|Korean frigate ''Apnok'']] (PF-62), damaged by gunfire, ''New Jersey'' was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, supporting the movement of the [[U.S. X Corps]]. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction of known targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A [[bridge]], a [[dam]], several gun emplacements, mortar positions, [[pillbox]]es, [[bunker]]s, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.<ref name="DANFS"/>

On [[1 October]] [[1951]], General [[Omar Bradley]], Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and General [[Matthew B. Ridgeway]], Commander in Chief Far East, came on board to confer with Admiral Martin.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Between [[1 October]] and [[6 October]] ''New Jersey'' was in action daily at Kansong, [[Hamhung]], [[Hungnam]], [[Tanchon]], and [[Songjin]]. Enemy bunkers and supply concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong; at the others ''New Jersey'' fired on railroads, [[tunnel]]s, bridges, an [[oil refinery]], [[train]]s, and shore batteries. She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five-inch gun mounts, which ''New Jersey'' successfully destroyed. The [[Kojo]] area was her target [[16 October]] as she sailed in company with [[HMS Belfast (C35)|HMS ''Belfast'']], pilots from [[HMAS Sydney (1934)|HMAS ''Sydney'']] spotting. The operation was well-planned and coordinated, and excellent results were obtained.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Another highly satisfactory day was [[16 October]], when the spotter over the Kansong area reported "beautiful shooting every shot on target-most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years." This five hour bombardment leveled ten [[artillery]] positions, and in smashing [[trench]]es and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' dashed up the [[North Korea]]n coast raiding transportation facilities from [[1 November]] to [[6 November]]. She struck at bridges, road, and rail installations at Wonsan, Hungnam, [[Tanchon]], [[Iowon]], Songjin, and Chongjin, leaving four bridges destroyed, others badly damaged, two marshaling yards badly torn up, and many feet of track destroyed. With renewed attacks on Kansong and near the [[Chang-San-Got Peninsula]] [[11 November]] and [[13 November]], ''New Jersey'' completed hew first tour of duty in Korea.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Relieved as flagship by [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] (BB-64), ''New Jersey'' cleared [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] for [[Hawaii]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the [[Panama Canal]], and returned to Norfolk [[20 December]] for a six-month overhaul. Between [[19 July]] [[1952]] and [[5 September]], she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber, who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], [[Lisbon]], and the Caribbean. Now ''New Jersey'' prepared and trained for her second Korean tour, for which she sailed from Norfolk [[5 March]] [[1953]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

[[Image:New Jersey in Korea II.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''New Jersey'' in Japanese waters, 1953]]
Shaping her course via the Panama Canal, Long Beach, and Hawaii, New Jersey reached Yokosuka [[5 April]], and next day relieved [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] (BB-63) as flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark, Commander 7th Fleet. On [[12 April]] ''New Jersey'' returned to action by shelling Chongjin; in seven minutes she scored seven direct hits, blowing away half the main communications building there. At [[Pusan]] two days later, ''New Jersey'' manned her rails to welcome the [[President of South Korea|President of the Republic of Korea]] and Madame Rhee, and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' fired on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo [[16 April]]; on railway track and tunnels near Hungnam [[18 April]]; and on gun emplacements around [[Wonsan Harbor]] [[20 April]], silencing them in five areas after she had herself take several near misses. Songjin provided targets [[23 April]]. Here ''New Jersey'' scored six direct 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' added provided artillery support for a major air and surface strike on Wonsan [[1 May]], as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship. She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day, and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the [[island]] of [[Hodo Pando]], commanding the harbor. Two days later [[Kalmagak]] at Wonsan was her target.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey''<U+2019>s tenth birthday, [[23 May]] [[1953]], was celebrated at [[Inchon]] with President and Madame Rhee, Lieutenant General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], and other dignitaries on board. Two days later ''New Jersey'' returned to action along the west coast at [[Chinampo]] to knock out harbor defense positions.<ref name="DANFS"/>

The battleship was under fire at Wonsan [[27 May]]<U+2013>[[29 May]], but her five-inch guns silenced the counter-fire, and her 16&nbsp;inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves. She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly: either a [[oil depot|fuel storage area]] or an [[ammunition dump]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' returned to the key task of direct support to troops at [[Kosong]] [[7 June]]. On her first mission, she completely destroyed two gun positions, an observation post, and their supporting trenches, then stood by on call for further aid. She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day-long bombardment [[24 June]], aimed at guns placed in caves. The results were excellent, with eight direct hits on three caves, one cave demolished, and four others closed. Next day she returned to troop support at Kosong, her assignment until [[10 July]], aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment.<ref name="DANFS"/>

At Wonsan [[11 July]]<U+2013>[[12 July]], ''New Jersey'' fired one of the most concentrated bombardments of her Korean duty. For nine hours the first day, and for seven the second, her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect. At least ten enemy guns were destroyed, many damaged, and a number of caves and tunnels sealed. ''New Jersey'' smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo [[13 July]], and was once more on the east coast bombline [[22 July]]<U+2013>[[24 July]] to support [[South Korea]]n troops near Kosong. These days found her gunners at their most accurate: A large cave, housing an important enemy observation post was closed, the end of a month-long United Nations effort, and a great many bunkers, artillery areas, observation posts, trenches, tanks and other weapons were destroyed.<ref name="DANFS"/>

At sunrise [[25 July]] [[1953]] ''New Jersey'' was off the key port, rail and communications center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factor area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a [[whaleboat]] in an attempt to spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six-gun salvo.<ref name="DANFS"/>

=== Post Korean War (1953<U+2013>1967) ===
''New Jersey's'' mission at Wonsan, next day, was her last. Here she destroyed large-caliber guns, bunkers, caves and trenches. Two days later, she learned of the truce. Her crew celebrated during a seven day visit at [[Hong Kong]], where she anchored [[20 August]]. Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder of her tour, which was highlighted by a visit to [[Pusan]]. Here President Rhee came aboard [[16 September]] to present the [[Korean Presidential Unit Citation]] to the 7th Fleet.<ref name="DANFS"/>

Relieved as flagship at Yokosuka by ''Wisconsin'' [[14 October]], ''New Jersey'' was homeward bound the next day, reaching Norfolk [[14 November]]. During the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with [[midshipmen]] on board for training, and during the rest of the year sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along the Atlantic coast and in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'' stood out of Norfolk [[7 September]] [[1955]] for her first tour of duty with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] in the [[Mediterranean]]. Her ports of call included [[Gibraltar]], [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], [[Cannes]], [[Istanbul]], [[Suda Bay]]; and [[Barcelona]]. She returned to Norfolk [[7 January]] [[1956]] for the spring program of training operations. That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training, bringing them home to [[Annapolis]] [[31 July]]. ''New Jersey'' sailed for Europe once more [[27 August]] as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn, Jr., Commander [[United States Second Fleet]]. She called at [[Lisbon]], participated in [[NATO]] exercises off [[Scotland]], and paid an official visit to [[Norway]] where Crown Prince [[Olav V of Norway|Olaf]] was a guest. She returned to Norfolk [[15 October]], and [[14 December]] arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne [[21 August]] [[1957]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

== The Vietnam War (1967<U+2013>1968) ==
In August of 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the descion to recomission a battleship "for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia".<ref name="vets">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussnewjersey.org/1968_narrative.htm |title=Narrative 1968 History of USS New Jersey (BB-62) |accessdate=2005-05-26 |publisher=USS New Jersey Veteran's, INC}}</ref> ''New Jersey'' was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters, having received an extensive overhaul proir to decommissioning. Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns on the battleship were removed, and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her radar. Armed as such ''New Jersey'' was formally recomissioned [[6 April]] [[1968]] at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], Captain [[J. Edward Snyder]] in command.<ref name="DANFS"/>

''New Jersey'', now the world's only active battleship, departed Philadelphia [[16 May]], calling at Norfolk and transiting the Panama Canal [[4 June]] before arriving at her new home port of [[Long Beach, California]], [[11 June]]. Further training off southern California followed. On [[24 July]] ''New Jersey'' received 16&nbsp;inch shells and powder tanks from [[USS Mount Katmai (AE-16)|''Mount Katmai'']] (AE-16) by conventional highline transfer and by helicopter lift, the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred by helicopter at sea.<ref name="DANFS"/>

[[Image:New Jersey Underway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''New Jersey'' en route to Vietnam, 1968]]
Departing Long Beach [[2 September]], ''New Jersey'' touched at Pearl Harbor and [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]] before sailing [[25 September]] for her first tour of gunfire support duty along the Vietnamese coast. Near the 17th parallel on [[30 September]], the dreadnought fired her first shots in battle in over sixteen years, expending a total of 29 rounds against Communist targets in and near the so-called [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]].<ref name="vets"/>

''New Jersey'' took up station off Tiger Island [[1 October]] and fired at targets north of the DMZ before moving south that afternoon to engage Viet Cong targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On [[3 October]] ''New Jersey'' fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on [[4 October]] the battleship fired on a communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of [[7 October]] ''New Jersey'' received word that a number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. ''New Jersey'' responded by closing on the formation, and succeded in sinking eleven of the crafts before they could beach.<ref name="vets"/>

On [[11 October]] ''New Jersey'' engaged a costal installation with her guns; however, she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky. ''New Jersey'' gunners quickly retrained the battleship's big guns and managed to inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicals.<ref name="vets"/>

Early on the morning of [[12 October]] ''New Jersey'' trained her guns in anticipation of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves. For the next three days ''New Jersey'' pounded the area with her 16&nbsp;in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region. Aided by spotter aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS America (CV-66)|''America'']], ''New Jersey'' engaged enemy targets, setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave. On [[14 October]] ''New Jersey'' shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island, destroying one battery on the island.<ref name="vets"/>

On [[16 October]] ''New Jersey'' took up station in support of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 3rd Marine Division]]. Using both the 16&nbsp;in and 5&nbsp;in guns ''New Jersey'' engaged and destroyed 13&nbsp;structures and an artillery site, in the process halting an enemy platoon moving through the DMZ. ''New Jersey'' continued to lend firepower support on the 17th until departing to lend her gunfire to the First Field Force. Foul weather prevented spotter aircraft from flying until [[20 October]]; however, ''New Jersey'' quickly made up for lost time on the gun line by destroying a Viet Cong command post and nine bunkers in support of the [[173d Airborne Brigade (United States)|173rd Airborne Brigade]], who were operating about 50&nbsp;miles north of Nha Trang. The next day ''New Jersey'' maneuvered into the waters of the Baie de Van Fong to fire at Viet Cong command posts, but poor visiability of the target area prevented any damage estimates.<ref name="vets"/>

On the night of [[23 October]] ''New Jersey'' steamed north to rearm before taking up position in support of the 3rd Marine Division [[25 October]]. That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane. The next day ''New Jersey'' engaged targets of opurtunity, destroying 11 structures, seven bunkers, a concrete observation tower, and an enemy trench line. She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at ''New Jersey'' with artillery positioned near Cap Lay. Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at ''New Jersey''; however, the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship. Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area, suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier. Armed with this information ''New Jersey'' fired five 16&nbsp;inch shells at the site, but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits.<ref name="vets"/>

On [[28 October]] ''New Jersey'' steamed south to engage communist targets. During the shelling aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti-aircraft fire to the extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, ''New Jersey'' altered her fire to silenced the site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' leveled 30&nbsp;structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. ''New Jersey'' responded by firing six 16&nbsp;inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on [[30 October]] destroyed a communist resupply area and an anti-aircraft site.<ref name="vets"/>

Upon completion of this mission ''New Jersey'' steamed south, taking a position off Da Nang and Point DeDe to lend naval gunfire support to the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Marine Division]] operating in the area. On [[2 November]] ''New Jersey'' commenced firing operations against nine positions, but the heavy foilage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of the shelling.<ref name="vets"/>

On [[4 November]] ''New Jersey'' received orders to reinforce southern II Corps near Phan Thiet; she arrived on station later that night. The next she answered eight call fire supprt missions from the 173rd Airborne Brigade, in the process destroying eight Viet Cong bunkers and five structures. On [[11 November]] ''New Jersey'' departed Vietnamese waters to replenishment; she returned to the gunline [[23 November]] and relieved [[USS Galveston (CLG-3)|''Galveston'']], taking up position in support of the U.S. Army<U+2019>s American Division. That afternoon ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s 5&nbsp;inch guns shelled enemy buildings, destroying 15&nbsp;structures and inflicted heavy damage on 29&nbsp;others.<ref name="vets"/>

On [[25 November]] ''New Jersey'' launched the most destructive shore bombardment of her Vietnam tour. For the next two days the battleship concentrated her fire at Viet Cong storage areas near Quang Ngai, destroying 182&nbsp;structures and 54&nbsp;bunkers, inflicting heavy damage to 93&nbsp;structures, and demolishing several tunnel complexes before departing for  Point Betsy near Hue [[27 November]] to support the [[101st Airborne Division (United States)|101st Airborne Division]].<ref name="vets"/>

Between [[2 December]] and [[8 December]] ''New Jersey'' returned to aid the 3rd Marine Division, shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for [[Singapore]] [[9 December]]. On [[26 December]] ''New Jersey'' returned to the gunline, taking up station off Tuy Hoa in support of the [[Republic of Vietnam]]'s 47th Army Division. For the next three days ''New Jersey'' fired her guns to support the II Corps, in the process destroying Viet Cong bunkers and supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts. ''New Jersey'' would remain in the waters of the DMZ until after [[New Years]], shelling communist bunkers for ground troops until leaving to support the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] [[3 January]].<ref name="vets"/> 

[[Image:USS New Jersey.jpg|300px|thumb|right|USS ''New Jersey''  bombarding positions during the [[Vietnam War]]]]
Throughout January and into February ''New Jersey'' operated in support of the Marines. On [[10 February]] the battleship left to reinforce the 2nd ROK Marine Brigade operating near Da Nang. The battleship's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment. ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s big guns went to work on the complex, firing 16&nbsp;inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops. On [[14 February]] the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division, in the process destroying an anti-aircraft site with her big guns. The next day ''New Jersey'' fired on an enemy rocket site northest of Con Thien, destroying the facility, then trained her guns on known communist positions to harass Viet Cong forces. On [[22 February]] ''New Jersey'' responded to an urgent request for fire support from a besieged outpost near the DMZ. For the next six hours ''New Jersey'' fired her guns, ultimetly repelling the attacking force.<ref name="vets II">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussnewjersey.org/1969_narrative.htm |title=1969 Narrative History of USS New Jersey (BB-62) |accessdate=2005-05-31 |publisher=USS New Jersey Veteran's, INC}}</ref>

For the remainder of February and into March ''New Jersey'' shelled targets along the DMZ. On [[13 March]] the battleship departed the gunline bound for [[Subic Bay]]. She retuned to action on [[20 March]], operating near Cam Ranh Bay in support of the Republic of Korea's Ninth Infantry Division. For the next week ''New Jersey'' patrolled the waters between Phan Thiet and Tuy Hoa, shelling targets of opertunity along the coast. On [[March 28]] ''New Jersey'' took up station south of the DMZ to aid the 3rd Marine Division, remaining there until [[1 April]], whereupon ''New Jersey'' departed for Japan.<ref name="vets II"/>

=== Post Vietnam War (1969<U+2013>1982) ===
Her first Vietnam combat tour completed, ''New Jersey'' departed Subic Bay [[3 April]] [[1969]] for [[Japan]]. She arrived at [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]] for a two-day visit, sailing for the United States [[9 April]]. Her homecoming, however, was to be delayed. On the 15th, while ''New Jersey'' was still at sea, [[North Korea]]n jet fighters [[EC-121 shootdown incident|shot down]] an unarmed [[EC-121 Constellation]] electronic surveillance plane over the [[Sea of Japan]], killing its entire crew. A carrier task force was formed and sent to the Sea of Japan, while ''New Jersey'' was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan. On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka, and immediately put to sea in readiness for what might befall.<ref name="DANFS"/> 

As the crisis eased, ''New Jersey'' was released to continue her interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach [[5 May]] [[1969]], her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise: on [[22 August]] [[1969]] the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] released a list of names of ships to be inactivated; at the top of the list was ''New Jersey''. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain [[Robert C. Peniston]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

Assuming command of a ship already earmarked for the "[[mothball fleet]]," Captain Peniston and his crew prepared for their task. ''New Jersey'' got underway on the voyage [[6 September]], departing Long Beach for [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]]. She arrived on the 8th, and began preinactivation overhaul to ready herself for decommissioning. On [[17 December]] [[1969]] ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s colors were hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet, still echoing the words of her last commanding officer: <U+201C>Rest well, yet sleep lightly; and hear the call, if again sounded, to provide fire power for freedom.<U+201D><ref name="DANFS"/>

== Reactivation (1982) ==
[[Image:New Jersey Modernized.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''New Jersey'' in drydock while undergoing modernization]]
As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Secretary of the Navy|Navy secretary]] [[John Lehman]]'s effort to create a [[600-ship Navy]], ''New Jersey'' was reactivated in 1982 and moved under tow to the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard]] for modernization. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using ''New Jersey'' and here sister ship ''Iowa'' to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missile, as well as point defense system mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5&nbsp;in gun mounts on ''New Jersey'' to make room for the armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomohawk missiles.<ref name="GOA1">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/f0102/115403.pdf |format=pdf  |title=Update of the Issues Concerning the Proposed Reactivation of the Iowa class battleships and the Aircraft Carrier Oriskany |accessdate=2005-05-25 |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office|United States General Accounting Office]]  |date=[[1981-04-20]] |pages=pp. 3<U+2013>18}}</ref><ref>At the time ''New Jersey'' was schedualed to undergo modernization the Tomahawk missile system had not yet been introduced for use in the field; however, the Navy announced plans to include the updates that would be needed for ''New Jersey'' to use the Tomohawk system while undergoing her modernization. {{cite web | url =http://archive.gao.gov/f0102/115403.pdf | title = Update of the Issues Concerning the Proposed Reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships and the Aircraft Carrier Oriskany | format = PDF date |publisher = United States General Accounting Office | [[April 20]] [[1981]] | accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> At one point the [[NATO]] [[Sea Sparrow]] was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.<ref>Statement by Admiral Rowden in the ''Department of Defense Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1982''.</ref><ref name="GOA1"/>

''New Jersey''<U+2019>s modernization was unique in that she was to be the only reactivated ''Iowa''-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to removed ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s #3 16&nbsp;in gun turret (located in the aft). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a [[vertical launch system|vertical launching missile magazine]] which would have enabled ''New Jersey'' to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on [[VTOL]] or [[V/STOL]] type aircraft;<ref name="GOA1"/> however these ideas were ultimately dropped, and ''New Jersey'' retained her #3 Gun Turret during her 1980s career.

Over the next several months the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 [[Harpoon missile|AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missiles, eight [[Armored Box Launcher|Armored Box Launcher (ABL)]] mounts for 32 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[missile]]s, and a quartet of the United States Navy's [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] [[Close-in weapon system|Close In Weapon System (CIWS)]] [[gatling gun]]s for defense against enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s and enemy aircraft.<ref name="FAS Iowa"/><ref name="The Battleships II">{{cite book  | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =page 183 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref><ref name="The Navy">{{cite book | last =Holland | first =W.

Because ''New Jersey'' had been recalled for service in the [[Vietnam War]] her modernization differed from her sisters for a number a reasons. When reactivated in 1967 ''New Jersey'' had her 20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon and 40&nbsp;mm Boffers anti-aircraft guns removed, and received improve electronic warfare capabilities. This alteration help speed up the time it took get ''New Jersey'' recomissioned: since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to ''New Jersey'' involved the removal of four of her ten 5&nbsp;in gun mounts to make room for the Armored Box Launchers.<ref name="FAS Iowa">{{cite web | title = BB-61 IOWA-class (Specifications)|url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |accessdate=2006-11-26}}</ref><ref>By comparison ''Iowa'', ''Missouri'', and ''Wisconsin'' had to be stripped of their 20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon and 40&nbsp;mm Boffers anti-aircraft guns, in addition to the removal of four of their ten 5&nbsp; guns.</ref> In addition to saving time, this also made ''New Jersey'' cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only inculded the addition of missile and gun system mounts, electronic warfare suits, and improved radar and gun spotter technology.<ref>The estimated cost of reactivating ''New Jersey'' with her gun turrets intact was $326 million, vs the estimated $392 million to reactivate ''Iowa''. {{cite web | url = http://archive.gao.gov/f0102/115403.pdf |format = PDF | publisher = United States General Accounting Office | title = Update of the Issues Concerning the Proposed Reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships and the Aircraft Carrier Oriskany | date = [[April 20]] [[1981]]| accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref><ref name="GOA1"/>

Since the Tomahawk missile system had not yet been adopted for use during ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s original update the Navy announced plans to divert assests from two of their [[Spruance class destroyer|''Spruance''-class]] [[destroyer]]s to install the nessicary Tomahawk launchers; Similarly, assests were diverted from two [[Farragut class destroyer (1958)|''Farragut''-class]] [[guided missile destroyer]]s to allow for the installation of Harpoon launchers, on ''New Jersey''.<ref name="GOA1"/>

On [[28 December]] [[1982]] ''New Jersey'' was formally recommissioned at [[Long Beach, California]], her new homeport. The recomissioning of ''New Jersey'' marked a return of the world's last battleships after a 13-year absence from the world's oceans.<ref>''New Jersey'' decommissioned in 1969, then was the first to be recommissioned under the 600-ship Navy program.  {{cite web |url=http://navysite.de/bb/bb62.htm |title=USS New Jersey (BB 62) |publisher=navysite.de|accessdate=2005-05-27}} </ref>

==Lebanese Civil War (1983<U+2013>1984)==
In 1983, a bloody [[civil war]] was raging in [[Lebanon]]. In an effort to stop the violence in the region a [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Multinational Force]] comprised largely of U.S. and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order. As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and elements of the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] which operated out of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name="CCN">{{cite web |url=http://historiccamdencounty.com/ccnews17.shtml |title=Launch your own missile from Battleship New Jersey: Warship Museum Prepares New 'Interactive' Combat Control Center

At the time the Multinational Force had arrived the Lebanese Civil War had shifted to the [[Chouf Mountains]] in what would later be termed the "Mountain War." In August 1983, [[Israel]] withdrew its [[Israel Defense Forces|Defense Forces]] from the [[Chouf District]] (southeast of Beirut), thus removing the buffer between the [[Druze]] and the [[Christian]] militias and triggering another round of brutal fighting. On [[16 September]] [[1983]] [[Druze]] forces massed on the threshold of [[Suk El Gharb]], a village defended by the Lebanese Army.<ref name="C">{{cite web |url=http://www.cedarland.org/war.html |title=The Lebanese War, Lebanese Civil War (subsection:The Israeli Defense Forces Withdrawal and the Mountain War) |accessdate=2007-05-25 |publisher=cederland.org}}</ref> Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias coming up from the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut-Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked [[Baabda, Yarze]], which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with [[artillery]].<ref name="C"/>

As the militias invaded and the Labanese forced began to lose ground [[Michel Aoun]], the commander of the Labanese 8th Mechanised Infantry Battalion defending the town, pleaded with United States to aid with the defense of the town.<ref name="C"/> Aoun cited [[Syria]]n involvement with the attacking militias as justification for U.S. aid in the defense of Suk El Gharb. At first the U.S. forces refused to get involved, citing their role as [[peacekeeper]]s in the region; however, when informed that Suk El Gharb would likely be overrun if something was not done the United States agreed to aid with the defense of the town. [[USS Virginia (CGN-38)|USS ''Virginia'']] (CGN-38), [[USS John Rodgers (DD-983)|USS ''John Rodgers'']] (DD-983), [[USS Bowen (FF-1079)|USS ''Bowen'']], and [[USS Arthur W. Radford (DD-968)|USS ''Radford'']] fired 338 rounds from their five inch (127&nbsp;mm) guns in support of [[Lebanese Army]] forces defending Suk El Gharb. The offshore artillery support helped the Labenese Army hold the town until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, the same day on which ''New Jersey'' joined the group.<ref name="C"/>

On [[November 28]] <U+2014> after [[October 23]], [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] <U+2014> the U.S. government announced that ''New Jersey'' would be retained off Beirut although her crew would be rotated. On [[14 December]], ''New Jersey'' fired 11 projectiles from her 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) guns at hostile positions inland of Beirut. These were the first 16&nbsp;inch (406&nbsp;mm) shells fired for effect anywhere in the world since ''New Jersey'' ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969.<ref name="navysite">{{cite web |url=http://navysite.de/bb/bb62.htm |title=USS New Jersey (BB 62) |publisher=navysite.de|accessdate=2005-05-27}}</ref>

On [[8 February]] [[1984]], ''New Jersey'' fired almost 300 shells at [[Druze]] and [[Syria]]n positions in the [[Bekaa valley]] east of Beirut. Some 30 of these massive projectiles rained down on a Syrian command post, killing the general commanding Syrian forces in Lebanon and several other senior officers. This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War.<ref name="navysite"/>

Although ''New Jersey'' preformed her job expertly during the intervention in Lebanon some have criticized the descion to have ''New Jersey'' shell Druze and Syrian forces. Members of this camp allege that this action forced a shift in the previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/104.htm |title=Lebanon - United States |accessdate=2007-05-25 |author=U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref> ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s shells had killed a number of Muslim civilians living in the targeted area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debianhelp.org/node/1183 |title=Do it now.

=== Post Lebanese Deployment (1984<U+2013>1990) ===
[[Image:New Jersey Shoots.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''New Jersey'' fires a broadside, December 1986]]
In 1986 ''New Jersey'' began her next deployment, this time operating as part of the Pacific Fleet and as the centerpiece of her own [[battleship battle group]] (BBBG). This was first time that ''New Jersey'' had operational control of her own battleship battle group since the Korean War, and she cruised with her excorts from [[Hawaii]] to [[Thailand]] in 1986, freeing up U.S. aircraft carriers for other missions and in the process becoming the only major U.S. naval presence in the region from May to October.<ref name="deployment">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussnewjersey.org/general/ship_move1.htm |title=History of the USS New Jersey, BB-62 |accessdate=2007-06-01 |last=Mooney |first=James L. |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Vol. V |publisher=United States Navy |pages=pp. 60<U+2013>63}}</ref>

Following an overhaul at Long Beach which lasted in to 1988 ''New Jersey'' returned to the Pacific Ocean, this time operating as part of a surface action group. The battleship operated near the cost of Korea prior to the opening of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul, South Korea]], then departed for [[Australia]] to particiapte in the Australian bicentennial celebrations.<ref name="deployment"/> 

In April of 1989, as ''New Jersey'' was preparing for her last operational cruise, sister ship [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|USS ''Iowa'']] (BB-61) suffered [[USS Iowa turret explosion|a catastrophic explosion in her #2 gun turret]]; fallout from the incident led U.S. Naval officials to freeze [[live fire exercise]]s with the guns until the investigation in to the explosion was concluded. Eventually, the ban was lifted and ''New Jersey'' was allowed to use her big guns again.<ref name="deployment"/>

The last cruise of the battleship ''New Jersey'' began in 1989 as part of Pacific Exercise '89. Upon completion of the exercise ''New Jersey'' sailed through the [[Indian Ocean]] and into the [[Persian Gulf]], in the process becoming the centerpiece for various battle groups and surface action groups. ''New Jersey'' remained in the Persian Gulf for the rest of the year, returing to the United States in February 1990.<ref name="deployment"/>

== Reserve Fleet & Museum Ship (1991<U+2013>Present) ==
With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining battleships as part of the active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, ''New Jersey'' was decommissioned for the final time at [[Naval Station Long Beach]], California, on [[8 February]] [[1991]]. The decision to decommission ''New Jersey'' robbed the battleship of the chance to participate in the 1991 [[Gulf War]]; the [[AirLand Battle|air and land war]] (codenamed [[Naming the Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]) had already begun and sister ships [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|''Wisconsin'']] were engaging [[Iraq]]i targets with Tomahawk missiles at the time of ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s decommissioning. Following her decommissioning ''New Jersey'' was towed to [[Bremerton, Washington]], where she remained in reserve until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in January 1995.<ref name="FAS Iowa"/>  

Section 1011 of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the ''Iowa''-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]] (or "mothball fleet"). The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corp's amphibious operations.<ref name="NDAA1996">{{cite web |url=http://www.nist.gov/director/ocla/Public_Laws/PL104-106.pdf |format=pdf |title=National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996(Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2005-05-26 |date=[[1996-02-10]] |page=422}}</ref> Due to [[USS Iowa (BB-61)|''Iowa''<U+2019>s]] damaged Turret 2 the Navy selected ''New Jersey'' for placement into the mothball fleet, even though the training mechanisms on ''New Jersey''<U+2019>s 16&nbsp;in guns had been welded down. The cost to fix ''New Jersey'' was considered less than the cost to fix ''Iowa'';<ref name="FAS Iowa"/> as a result, ''New Jersey'' and ''Wisconsin'' were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet.<ref name="NDAA1996"/>

[[Image:USSNewJersey looking aft.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the deck of ''New Jersey'' at her berth in Camden. The battleship was donated to the Home Port Alliance of [[Camden, New Jersey]], for use as a [[museum ship]].]]
''New Jersey'' remained in mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through the [[United States Congress]] [[18 October]] [[1998]]. Section 1011 required the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] to list and maintain ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the [[Naval Vessel Register]], while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike ''New Jersey'' from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a non-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10, United States Code]]. Section 1012 also required the transfree to locate the battleship in the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/1999NDAA.pdf |format=pdf |title=Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 (Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards) |accessdate=2007-03-12 |publisher=105th Congress, United States Senate and House of Representatives |pages=pp. 200<U+2013>201}}</ref> The Navy made the switch in January 1999, and on [[12 September]], ''New Jersey'' was towed by the tug ''Sea Victory'' from [[Bremerton, Washington]] to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for restoration work in the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in advance of her planned donation for use as a museum.<ref name="showboat">{{cite web |url=http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/history/milestone_dates.php |title=Battleship New Jersey |publisher=Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial|accessdate=2005-05-26}}</ref>

Two competing requests for the battleships were filed, one by the USS New Jersey Battleship Commission of [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], and one by the Home Port Alliance of Camden, New Jersey. Both teams worked hard to develope a comprehensive plan to operate and maintain the battleship as a museum. After a review of both of the submitted plans, the Navy selected the Home Port Alliance of Camden, NJ, as the battleship's final resting place. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig made the announcement on [[20 January]] [[2000]],<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/docs/b01202000_bt027-00.htm |title=SECNAV announces the Battleship New Jersey donation |publisher=Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs)|accessdate=2005-05-26 |date=[[2000-01-20]] |publisher=United States Navy}}</ref> and in October of that year ''New Jersey'' arrived at her final resting place on the Camden Waterfront. Shortly after her arrival ''New Jersey'' was opened to the public, officially beginning her new career as a [[museum ship]]. Self-guided, tour-guided and overnight encampments are offered on the floating museum. Overnight encampments, typically for the benefit of scouting organizations, offer the opportunity to sleep and eat in the original berths and mess decks.<ref name="showboat"/>

In 1996 an attempt was made to add ''New Jersey'' to the New Jersey State Registery of Historic Places; however the battleship was still owned by the Navy and was not in the State of New Jersey, and as a result the attempt failed. In 2004, a second attempt succeded, and the State of New Jersey officially designated the battleship USS ''New Jersey'' a historical place.<ref name="news">{{cite web |url=http://www.southjerseynews.com/battleship/m011104j.htm |title=Big J listed as historic place |accessdate=2005-05-26 |last=Comegno |first=Carol |date=[[2004-01-11]] |publisher=Courier-Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/hpo/hpb_summer2004.pdf  |format=pdf |title=Historic Preservation Bulletin |accessdate=2005-05-26 |publisher=The New Jersey Department of Enviromental Protection: Historic Preservation Office |year=2004|page=p. 3}}</ref> This cleared ''New Jersey'' for placements on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], a list to which ''New Jersey'' was officially added [[17 September]] [[2004]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nr.nps.gov/iwisapi/explorer.dll?IWS_SCHEMA=NRIS1&IWS_LOGIN=1&IWS_REPORT=100000066 |title=National Register of Historic Places |accessdate=2005-05-26 |publisher=National Parks Service |authorlink=United States National Park Service }}</ref>
