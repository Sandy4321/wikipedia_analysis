"'''American Life'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], from her [[American Life|ninth studio album of the same name]] (2003). It was written and produced by Madonna and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]], and it was released digitally as the [[lead single]] from the album on April 8, 2003 by [[Maverick Records]]. The lyrics to "American Life" feature violent transitions and a political and religious view from Madonna. She also performs a rap naming the people who are working for her, and she questions the shallowness of modern life and the "[[american dream]]" under United States's ex-president [[George W. Bush]] conservative watch.

"American Life" was universally panned by [[Music journalism|music critics]], with ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' naming it as the ninth worst song of all time. Despite receiving mostly negative reviews from critics, "American Life" reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Italy, Japan and Switzerland, and the top ten in Australia, where the song was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). However, the song peaked number thirty-seven in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], until descending, staying in the charts for eight weeks, while peaking number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Two music videos were shot for the song. One was the uncensored version, which featured Madonna at a [[military]]-themed fashion show,  cavorting with a brigade of female soldiers and in the end, she throws a [[hand grenade]] at [[George W. Bush]]. It received some controversy, regarding political, racial, violence and religious views. After the [[invasion of Iraq]] was started, Madonna censored the first version and released an alternative version, featuring her in front of a backdrop of [[flag]]s from around the world. The song was performed at her [[Re-Invention World Tour]] (2004).

==Background and release==
In an interview with [[VH1]], Madonna discussed her motivations behind ''American Life'' discussing her 20 years in the industry. Stating that "material things" were unimportant, she also stated that "I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I'd valued weren't important", in response to the non-materialistic themes of the record.<ref name="pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/madonna-speaks-for-the-first-time-to-vh1-on-new-american-life-album-and-video-in-half-hour-special-followed-by-us-premiere-of-a-performance-only-version-of-the-new-american-life-video-70870767.html|title='Madonna Speaks' For The First Time To VH1 On New 'American Life' Album|publisher=VH1. PR Newswire|date=2003-04-16|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> Discussing the album, Madonna said about "American Life":

<blockquote>
"[The song] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me. What is my perspective now? I've fought for so many things, I've tried so hard to be number one and to stay on top, to look good, to be the best. And I realized that a lot of things that last and the things that matter are none of those things."
</blockquote>

"American Life" premiered on March 25, 2003, through [[AOL]].<ref name="hull">{{harvnb|P.

"American Life" was written and produced by Madonna and [[Mirwais Ahmadza<U+00EF>]]. Starting with Madonna's voice multi-tracked questioning, "Am I gonna be a star", "should I change my name", the lyrics then develop into what Rikky Rooksby of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'' states is a complaint about modern-day life.<ref name="rikk1"/> She also questions the shallowness of modern life and the "[[american dream]]" under United States's ex-president [[George W. Bush]] conservative watch.<ref name="gno">{{harvnb|Gnojewski|2007|pp=129}}</ref> After three minutes, Madonna performs a [[rapping|rap]] naming the people who are working for her.<ref name="rikk1"/> Madonna said that "Basically, we [she and Ahmadza<U+00EF>] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy [[latte]]s in the studio, and I drive my [[Mini (BMW)|Mini Cooper]] to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous."<ref name="madonnaherameric">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/madonna/news_feature_042203/ |first=John|last= Norris|publisher=[[MTV News]].

The repeated acoustic guitar riff "adds a touch of pathos" to the song, according to biographer Carol Gnojewski.<ref name="gno"/> The lyrics accompany a "punchy octave synth figure" synchronized with a drum and bass beat.<ref name="rikk1">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=61}}</ref> "American Life" is written in the time signature of [[common time]] with a moderate tempo of 102 beats per minute.

==Critical reception==
"American Life" was met with generally negative reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Sal Cinquemani from ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' labeled it a "trite, self-aggrandizing and often awkward song about privilege" and a "dour and robotic" track.<ref name="slannt">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/madonna-american-life/1417|title=Madonna: American Life|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|date=2008-07-11|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=2011-08-11}}</ref> ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' commented negatively: "When one of the world's richest women complains about commercialism and the emptiness of entertainment culture ... it just comes across as hypocritical rather than insightful; here, she's raging against the life she herself is leading."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/madonna/american-life.htm|title=Madonna "American Life"|last=Howard|first=Ed|date=2003-09-01|work=[[Stylus Magazine]]|publisher=|accessdate=2010-01-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100202081131/http://stylusmagazine.com/reviews/madonna/american-life.htm| archivedate= 2 February 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard]]'' gave a negative review for the song, criticizing Madonna's [[rapping]] and calling the song "a blurry snarl of style and composition that's sounds more like a disjointed medley than a song."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fA0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=a+blurry+snarl+of+style+and+composition+that%27s+sounds+more+like+a+disjointed+medley+than+a+song#v=onepage&q=a%20blurry%20snarl%20of%20style%20and%20composition%20that%27s%20sounds%20more%20like%20a%20disjointed%20medley%20than%20a%20song&f=false |title=Reviews & Previews: Spotlights &#124;<U+00FA>ltimo=Taylor|primeiro=Chuck |publisher=''Billboard''.

That the world is ruled by a shadowy cabal of super-intelligent lizards?... Sadly not. Her extreme point of view turns out to be that money can't buy you happiness and that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be." He also panned the lyric "I like to express my extreme point of view", saying that it's difficult to hear that line without feeling a prickle of excitement.<ref>{{cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/apr/11/popandrock.artsfeatures|title=CD: Madonna: American Life|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=2003-04-11|accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the song a yammered list of celeb perks: trainer, butler, assistant, three nannies, a bodyguard or five, that seems, at first, not like the clever self-twitting she clearly intended, but rather a facile confirmation of her haters' most knee-jerk conviction: that middle-aged Madge does not have a worldview beyond her next [[Pilates]] appointment.<ref name="Entertainment Weekly">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,444558~4~0~americanlife,00.html|title=American Life Review|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=2003-04-25|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In 2004, ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine listed the song at number 9 on the list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, stating that Madonna "updates the '[[Material Girl]]'-era satire of commercialism and spiritual emptiness... with what is hands-down the most embarrassing rap ever recorded. Nervous and choppy, she makes [[Debbie Harry]] sound as smooth as [[Jay-Z]]." The magazine said that the worst moment of the song is when after rapping, Madonna sings, 'Nothing is what it seems,' in a manner drained of all profundity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Staff|first=TMZ|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/06/21/madonna-clay-aiken-in-top-50-worst-songs-ever/|title=Madonna, Clay Aiken in Top 50 Worst Songs Ever|work=TMZ|publisher=EHM Productions, Inc.|date=2006-06-21|accessdate=2012-07-17}}</ref> Stephen Thompson of ''[[The A.V.

The controversial [[music video]] was shot on the first week of February 2003 at [[Los Angeles Center Studios]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] by Swedish director [[Jonas <U+00C5>kerlund]], who worked with Madonna in her videos for "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]" (1998) and "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]" (2000).<ref name="mt"/> Madonna had the idea for the music video in November 2002, then she and <U+00C5>kerlund developed the idea to make an anti-war and anti-fashion mini-movie.<ref name="madonnaherameric"/> With "American Life", she took her music videos to a different level by focusing on war, politics and the then-upcoming invasion of Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusicvideogalleries/tp/Top-10-Madonna-Videos.htm|title=Top 10 Madonna Music Videos|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> The video begins with several male and female models dressed up as soldiers on a fashion runway, inter-cut with scenes of Madonna singing in front of a black background. During the second verse, she is shown in a restroom with four women, each aggressively preparing to enter the fashion show. In the second chorus, middle-eastern children are seen walking on the runway, and being bullied by the soldier models. During the bridge, Madonna and her group are angrily walking down a hallway, then seen dancing in front of surveillance cameras. When the rap section starts, Madonna is seen crashing into the show driving a Mini Cooper, then rapping and dancing on top of the car with her gang, after-which she starts spraying water on the audience and numerous paparazzi using a water cannon, inter-cut with scenes of injured and maimed soldier-models, war scenes, footage of poverty, hunger, death and explosions. In the end of the video, Madonna frantically drives out of the runway into the amused audience, and throws a [[hand grenade]] to George W. Bush, and the video ends with him using it to light up his cigar.
