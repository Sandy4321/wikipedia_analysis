==Background and recording==
In November 2006, Jack Black expressed wishes to take a year-long break from acting, though Kyle Gass hinted a desire for Tenacious D to end at their current highpoint.<ref name="associated-press-interview">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Tenacious D: Portly powerhouse of rock |work=[[KLTV]] |url=http://www.kltv.com/global/story.asp?s=5722208 |date=2006-11-23 |accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> However, Black confirmed that a third album would be recorded by announcing that a new song has been written for it entitled "Deth Starr".

Music magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' quoted Black as revealing that "We just laid down a hot [...] we're calling it the bomb track.

He performed a vocal sample of the song along to keyboards.

At one point, Gass hinted that the band's third album may be called ''Tenacious D 3-D'', reasoning that "It's the third record, so it should probably be 'Tenacious 3-D.'

Maura Johnstone from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album 2 out of 5 stars and viewed it as "so bombastic you wonder if Black and Gass have finally turned into the overblown wanksters they parody" and reproached that "too many of its gags sound like they've been festering since the ''Pick of Destiny'' days".

Conversely, [[NME]]'s Hamish MacBain refused to even give the album a rating out of ten, claiming that the band were responsible for an influx of imitation commercial rock bands and had crippled the industry. This review was heavily criticised by readers and other publications for its brevity and lack of analytical elaboration.<ref>http://www.nme.com/reviews/tenacious-d/13225</ref>
