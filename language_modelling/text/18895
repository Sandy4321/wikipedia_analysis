'''Saint Rudesind''' ({{lang-es|San Rosendo, Rudesindo}}) ([[November 26]], [[907]]<U+2014>[[March 1]], [[977]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[bishop]] and [[abbot]].  He was born into the nobility; his father was Count Guti<U+00E9>rre Men<U+00E9>ndez, brother-in-law to [[Ordo<U+00F1>o II]] and supporter of [[Alfonso III of Le<U+00F3>n]], and his mother was St. Induaria (Ilduara) Eriz, a cousin to Alfonso III.<ref>http://www.terradecelanova.com/html/san_rosendo.htm</ref><ref>http://www.vitral.org/vitral/vitral52/centdio.htm</ref>  Rudesind was related to the abbess [[Saint Senorina]].  He became a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] at a young age and became bishop of [[Mondo<U+00F1>edo]] (Dumium) at the age of 18, succeeding his uncle Albaric (Albarico, also known as Sabarico II).<ref>http://www.terradecelanova.com/html/san_rosendo.htm</ref> 

==Founder of Monasteries==
[[Image:Mosterio de San Xo<U+00E1>n de caaveiro.Galicia.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Monastery of Saint John of Caaveiro.]]
He founded, under the [[Benedictine Rule]], monasteries such as [[Saint John of Caaveiro]] (San Xo<U+00E1>n de Caaveiro) (934) and [[Celanova|Celanova Abbey]] (September 12, 936).

To build Caaviero, he managed to make his brother Fruela and his cousin Jimena give up their rights to the land of Villar, where he built this monastery.<ref>http://www.mercaba.org/SANTORAL/Vida/03/03-01_san_rosendo.htm</ref> 

==Administrative and military career==
In 955, he was named by [[Ordo<U+00F1>o III of Le<U+00F3>n|King Ordo<U+00F1>o III]] governor of the lands of Celanova.  Rudesind also had jurisdiction over the ''comarca'' that extended from [[Riocaldo]] (the southern boundary of Galicia) to Santa Maria de [[Ortigueira]] (on the [[Bay of Biscay|Cantabrian]] coast).<ref>http://www.terradecelanova.com/html/san_rosendo.htm</ref>    Later, at the request of [[Elvira Ram<U+00ED>rez]], aunt of the future [[Ramiro III of Le<U+00F3>n|Ramiro III]], he was made governor of Galicia, from spring of 968 to early 969.<ref>http://www.terradecelanova.com/html/san_rosendo.htm</ref>     

He led forces against [[Norsemen|Norse]] and [[Moorish]] armies.  The Moors had crossed the [[Mondego]] and had reached the [[Minho River|Minho]].<ref>http://www.mercaba.org/SANTORAL/Vida/03/03-01_san_rosendo.htm</ref> 

In [[966]], the Norsemen had raided [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]] and killed the bishop of Santiago de Compostela in battle, but Rudesind later rallied the local forces and killed their leader Gundered.

==Episcopal career==
Rudesind had already served as bishop of Mondo<U+00F1>edo.  He then became bishop of [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]], replacing his cousin Sisnand (Sisnando), who was considered corrupt.

Sisnand attacked Rudesind during [[Christmas|Christmas Mass]] when the former had escaped from prison.  

He was later appointed administrator of the diocese of [[Iria Flavia]] after the bishop there was killed by the Norsemen.  He was in charge of the diocese from 970 to 974.  After 974, he retired from his sees (he was succeeded at Compostela by Pelayo Rodr<U+00ED>guez, a monk of Celanova).

==Career as abbot==
Rudesind succeeded St. Franquila (originally from the monastery of [[Ribas de Sil]]) as abbot of Celanova.  As abbot of Celanova, he was a leading figure of his time, and received visits from religious leaders throughout [[Portugal]] who wanted spiritual advice.<ref>http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4646</ref>  A [[deacon]] named Egilanus (Egilano), in a donation that he made to Celanova, wrote this to Rudesind: "To you, eminent bishop, Rudesind, holiest father, true teacher, who teaches your subjects with your words and deeds...".<ref>http://www.mercaba.org/SANTORAL/Vida/03/03-01_san_rosendo.htm</ref>  He earned a reputation for performing [[miracles]].<ref>http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4646</ref>

==Veneration==
In 1601, his [[relics]] were exhumed and placed in a silver [[urn]] at the principal altar of the church of Celanova Abbey.<ref>http://www.terradecelanova.com/html/san_rosendo.htm</ref>   

==Legends==
A legend told of Rudesind concerns his birth.  His mother had had previous children, but they had all died in infancy.  When her husband Gutierre went on an expedition to [[Coimbra]] with Alfonso III, Ilduara accompanied him.  She prayed at the hermitage of San Salvador on Mount Coruba, after climbing up to it alone and barefoot.  There she received the knowledge, from [[Saint Michael]], that she would bear a son who would become not only a great leader of men but also a holy man.  In gratitude, she ordered the construction of a church there and remained until Rudesind had been born.  She wanted to baptize her son at San Salvador, but the cart used to haul up the [[baptismal font]] broke down.  The workers went to get another cart.  Meanwhile, however, Saint Michael had the broken cart move up the hill on its own accord.<ref>http://catholicforum.com/saints/saintr1h.htm</ref><ref>http://www.mercaba.org/SANTORAL/Vida/03/03-01_san_rosendo.htm</ref>
