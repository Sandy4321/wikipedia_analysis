The church was built between about 1840 and 1842, and was designed by [[A. W. N. Pugin]].  Of this church, only the west steeple has survived.  The body of the church was completely rebuilt in 1951<U+2013>57, and was designed by [[Adrian Gilbert Scott]].<ref name=pev>{{Citation | last =Pollard| first =Richard | authorlink = | last2 = Pevsner | first2 = Nikolaus | author2-link =Nikolaus Pevsner| series= The Buildings of England|title =Lancashire: Liverpool and the South-West |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]] | year =2006 | location =New Haven and London | pages = 480<U+2013>481| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-300-10910-5 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
The steeple is built in red [[sandstone]], and consists of a tower with a [[broach spire]].  It is in [[Decorated Gothic|Decorated]] style and has fine carved detail.<ref name=pev/>  The tower is in four stages, with diagonal [[buttress]]es and a pointed west entrance.  Over the entrance is a three-light window, and in the third stage are [[lancet window]]s on three sides.  The top stage contains two-light bell openings.  On the spire are three tiers of [[lucarne]]s.  To the south of the steeple is a [[cant (architecture)|canted]] stair [[turret]] with a stone [[hipped roof]].<ref name=nhl/>  Other than the west front, the body of the church is in brick, with four-light [[Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] windows along the sides of the [[aisle]]s.<ref name=pev/>

===Interior===
Inside the church the walls are in stone up to head height, and in painted concrete above.  The [[pier (architecture)|piers]] of the [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] carry [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] concrete arches spreading in four directions.  The high altar is surrounded by a [[baldacchino]] in multi-coloured [[marble]].  The [[nave]] altar and the [[lectern]] stand on a platform.<ref name=pev/>  The two-[[manual (music)|manual]] [[pipe organ]] was made by Ainscough, and rebuilt in 1987 by [[Rushworth and Dreaper]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N00179| title = Lancashire (Merseyside), Liverpool, Old Swan, St. Oswald (N00179)| accessdate = 27 July 2013 | publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>

==Associated buildings==
South of the church is a group of buildings that evoke "Pugin's ideal of a medieval Christian community".<ref name=pev/>
===Presbytery===
This was built in 1857 and designed by [[E. W. Pugin]].<ref name=pev/>  It stands to the south of the church, and is built in stone with a [[slate]] roof.  The presbytery has two storeys, and a front of four [[bay (architecture)|bays]].  The end bays project forward, the first bay under a [[gable]], the fourth bay with a [[bay window]] under a hipped roof.  Above the entrance in the third bay is a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] containing a statue of Saint Oswald.  The presbytery is listed at Grade&nbsp;II.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1292399|desc= Presbytery of St. Oswald's, Liverpool|accessdate= 27 July 2013|separator=,|ps=|fewer-links=x}}</ref>

===Schools and parish hall===
To the southwest of the church are two former schools with gables facing St Oswald's Street.  That nearer the church is a simple building, in one storey, and with plain [[mullion]]ed windows.<ref name=pev/>  Beyond this is a larger former school, dating from about 1855, and possibly designed by A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Pugin.  It is in sandstone with a slate roof, has two storeys, and is in a T-shaped plan, with a front of seven bays.  The windows on the sides are [[ogee]]-headed lancets, and at the end facing the street is a three-light Decorated window.  The school was later used as a youth centre, and is designated as a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.<ref name=pev/><ref>{{NHLE |num= 1292361|desc= Montini Youth Centre, Liverpool|accessdate= 27 July 2013|separator=,|ps=|fewer-links=x}}</ref>  To the south of this is a former [[Methodist]] chapel of 1845.  It is a simple rectangular [[stucco]]ed brick building with round-headed windows, which has been converted for use as the parish hall.<ref name=pev/>

===Convent of Mercy===
This is a sandstone group of buildings with slate roofs attached to the rear of the smaller school, which was almost certainly designed by A. W. N. Pugin.  It consists of ranges of buildings on the north and east sides of a courtyard in one and two storeys.  The convent building itself is small, containing only eight cells, with a chapel on the first floor.  The convent complex is a Grade&nbsp;II listed building.<ref name=pev/><ref>{{NHLE |num= 1073478|desc= Convent of Mercy, Liverpool|accessdate= 28 July 2013|separator=,|ps=|fewer-links=x}}</ref>
