'''Astrocytes''' (Astro from Greek ''astron'' = star and ''cyte'' from Greek "kyttaron" = cell), also known collectively as '''astroglia''', are characteristic star-shaped [[neuroglia|glial]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. They are the most abundant cells of the human brain. They perform many functions, including biochemical support of [[endothelial cell]]s that form the [[blood<U+2013>brain barrier]], provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintenance of extracellular ion balance, and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries.

Research since the mid-1990s has shown that astrocytes propagate intercellular [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and, similar to neurons, release transmitters (called [[gliotransmitter]]s) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Data suggest that astrocytes also signal to neurons through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of [[glutamate]].<ref name="pmid18834310">{{cite journal |author=Fiacco TA, Agulhon C, McCarthy KD |title=Sorting out Astrocyte Physiology from Pharmacology |journal=[[Annu.

==Description==
Astrocytes are a sub-type of [[glial cells]] in the [[central nervous system]]. They are also known as ''astrocytic glial cells.'' Star-shaped, their many processes envelope [[synapses]] made by [[neuron]]s.  Astrocytes are classically identified using [[histological]] analysis; many of these cells express the intermediate filament [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarma|first1=PotukuchiVenkata Gurunadha Krishna|last2=Srikanth|first2=Lokanathan|last3=Vengamma|first3=Bhuma|last4=Venkatesh|first4=Katari|last5=Chandrasekhar|first5=Chodimella|last6=Mouleshwara Prasad|first6=BodapatiChandra|last7=Sanjeevkumar|first7=Akula|title=In vitro differentiation of cultured human CD34+ cells into astrocytes|journal=Neurology India|volume=61|issue=4|year=2013|pages=383<U+2013>8|doi=10.4103/0028-3886.117615|pmid=24005729}}</ref> Several forms of astrocytes exist in the [[Central Nervous System]] including ''[[fibrous]]'' (in white matter), ''[[protoplasmic]]'' (in grey matter), and ''radial''. The fibrous glia are usually located within white matter, have relatively few [[organelles]], and exhibit long unbranched cellular processes. This type often has "[[vascular]] feet" that physically connect the cells to the outside of [[capillary]] walls when they are in close proximity to them. The  protoplasmic glia are the most prevalent and are found in grey matter tissue, possess a larger quantity of organelles, and exhibit short and highly branched tertiary processes. The radial glia are disposed in a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[perpendicular]] to [[axis of symmetry|axis]] of [[Ventricular system|ventricles]].  One of their processes about the pia mater, while the other is deeply buried in gray matter.  Radial glia are mostly present during development, playing a role in [[neuron migration]]. [[Mueller cells]] of [[retina]] and [[Bergmann]] glia cells of cerebellar cortex represent an exception, being present still during [[adulthood]]. When in proximity to the [[pia mater]], all three forms of astrocytes send out processes to form the pia-glial [[membrane]].

Previously in medical science, the neuronal network was considered the only important one, and astrocytes were looked upon as ''gap fillers''. More recently, the function of astrocytes has been reconsidered,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_01/a_01_cl/a_01_cl_ana/a_01_cl_ana.html |title=The Brain From Top To Bottom |publisher=Thebrain.mcgill.ca |accessdate=2008-11-29| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081209232330/http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_01/a_01_cl/a_01_cl_ana/a_01_cl_ana.html| archivedate= 9 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> and are now thought to play a number of active roles in the brain, including the secretion or absorption of neural transmitters and maintenance of the blood<U+2013>brain barrier.<ref>Kolb, Brian and Whishaw, Ian Q. (2008) ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology''. Worth Publishers. 6th ed. ISBN 0716795868</ref> Following on this idea the concept of a "tripartite synapse" has been proposed, referring to the tight relationship occurring at synapses among a presynaptic element, a postsynaptic element and a glial element.<ref name=Araque>{{cite journal | author = Araque A, Parpura V, Sanzgiri RP, Haydon PG | title = Tripartite synapses: glia, the unacknowledged partner| journal = Trends in Neuroscience | volume = 22 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10322493 | pages = 208<U+2013>215 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01349-6 | issue = 5 }}</ref>

* '''Structural''': They are involved in the physical structuring of the brain. Astrocytes get their name because they are "star-shaped". They are the most abundant glial cells in the brain that are closely associated with neuronal synapses. They regulate the transmission of electrical impulses within the brain.
* '''Glycogen fuel reserve buffer''': Astrocytes contain [[glycogen]] and are capable of [[glycogenesis]].  The astrocytes next to neurons in the [[frontal cortex]] and [[hippocampus]] store and release glycogen.  Thus, Astrocytes can fuel neurons with glucose during periods of high rate of glucose consumption and glucose shortage.  Recent research suggests there may be a connection between this activity and exercise.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reynolds, Gretchen | title = How Exercise Fuels the Brain | url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/how-exercise-fuels-the-brain | journal = New York Times | date = 22 February 2012}}</ref>
* '''Metabolic support''': They provide neurons with nutrients such as [[lactic acid|lactate]].
* '''[[Blood<U+2013>brain barrier]]''': The astrocyte end-feet encircling [[endothelial cell]]s  were thought to aid in the maintenance of the blood<U+2013>brain barrier, but recent research indicates that they do not play a substantial role; instead, it is the [[tight junctions]] and [[basal lamina]] of the cerebral endothelial cells that play the most substantial role in maintaining the barrier.<ref>{{cite book| author = Kimelberg HK, Jalonen T, Walz W. |chapter=Regulation of the brain microenvironment:

* '''Transmitter uptake and release''': Astrocytes express plasma membrane transporters such as [[glutamate transporter]]s for several neurotransmitters, including [[glutamate]], ATP, and [[GABA]]. More recently, astrocytes were shown to release glutamate or [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in a vesicular, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Santello M, Volterra A | title = Synaptic modulation by astrocytes via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent glutamate release. | series = Mar    | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 158 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18455880 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.03.039 | pages = 253<U+2013>9 | issue = 1}}</ref> (This has been disputed for hippocampal astrocytes.)<ref>{{cite journal | author = Agulhon C, Fiacco T, McCarthy K | title = Hippocampal short- and long-term plasticity are not modulated by astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5970 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20203048 | doi = 10.1126/science.1184821 | pages = 1250<U+2013>1257}}</ref>
* '''[[potassium spatial buffering|Regulation of ion concentration in the extracellular space]]''': Astrocytes express [[potassium channels]] at a high density. When neurons are active, they release potassium, increasing the local extracellular concentration. Because astrocytes are highly permeable to potassium, they rapidly clear the excess accumulation in the extracellular space.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Walz W | title = Role of astrocytes in the clearance of excess extracellular potassium | journal = Neurochemistry International | year = 2000 | doi=10.1016/S0197-0186(99)00137-0}}</ref> If this function is interfered with, the extracellular concentration of potassium will rise, leading to neuronal depolarization by the [[Goldman equation]].

* '''Promotion of the myelinating activity of [[oligodendrocyte]]s''': Electrical activity in neurons causes them to release ATP, which serves as an important stimulus for myelin to form. However, the ATP does not act directly on oligodendrocytes. Instead, it causes astrocytes to secrete cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a regulatory protein that promotes the myelinating activity of oligodendrocytes.  This suggest that astrocytes have an executive-coordinating role in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ishibashi T, Dakin K, Stevens B, Lee P, Kozlov S, Stewart C, Fields R | title = Astrocytes Promote Myelination in Response to Electrical Impulses | journal = Neuron | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 823<U+2013>32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16543131 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2006.02.006 | pmc = 1474838}}</ref>
* '''Nervous system repair''': Upon injury to nerve cells within the central nervous system, astrocytes fill up the space to form a [[glial scar]], repairing the area by transformation into neurons<ref>http://lenta.ru/news/2014/10/12/cvi/</ref> and replacing the CNS cells that cannot regenerate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
*'''Long-term potentiation''': Scientists debate whether astrocytes integrate learning and memory in the hippocampus. It is known that glial cells are included in neuronal synapses, but many of the LTP studies are performed on slices, so scientists disagree on whether or not astrocytes have a direct role of modulating synaptic plasticity.

==Contributions to neurodevelopment disorders==
A relatively new direction has emerged in the field of neurodevelopmental disorders. This view states that astrocyte dysfunction may play a role in the aberration of neuronal circuitry, that underlies certain psychiatric disorders, including the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barker|first1=AJ|last2=Ullian|first2=EM|title=New roles for astrocytes in developing synaptic circuits.|journal=Communicative & integrative biology|date=2008|volume=1|issue=2|pages=207<U+2013>11|pmid=19513261|doi=10.4161/cib.1.2.7284}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sloan|first1=SA|last2=Barres|first2=BA|title=Mechanisms of astrocyte development and their contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders.|journal=Current opinion in neurobiology|date=Mar 29, 2014|volume=27C|pages=75<U+2013>81|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2014.03.005|pmid=24694749}}</ref>

==Recent studies==

A recent study, done in November 2010 and published March 2011, was done by a team of scientists from the [[University of Rochester]] and [[University of Colorado School of Medicine]] They did an experiment to attempt to repair [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] to the [[Central Nervous System]] of an adult rat by replacing the glial cells. When the glial cells were injected into the injury of the adult rat<U+2019>s spinal cord, astrocytes were generated by exposing human glial precursor cells to bone morphogenetic protein (Bone morphogenetic protein is important because it is considered to create [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] architecture throughout the body). So, with the bone protein and human glial cells combined, they promoted significant recovery of conscious foot placement, [[axonal]] growth, and obvious increases in neuronal survival in the spinal cord [[Basal lamina|laminae]]. On the other hand, human glial [[precursor cells]] and astrocytes generated from these cells by being in contact with [[cilium|ciliary]] neurotrophic factors, failed to promote neuronal survival and support of axonal growth at the spot of the injury.<ref name="ref34">{{cite journal | author=Davies SJA |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0017328 | author2=Shih C-H | author3=Noble M | author4=Mayer-Proschel M | author5=Davies JE | display-authors=5 | title=Transplantation of Specific Human Astrocytes Promotes Functional ''Recovery after'' spinal Cord Injury | year=2011 | editor1-last=Combs | editor1-first=Colin | last6=Proschel | first6=Christoph | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=e17328 | pmid=21407803 | pmc=3047562 }}</ref>

One study done in [[Shanghai]] had two types of [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] neuronal cultures: In one culture, the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a [[glial conditioned medium]] (GCM), which inhibits the rapid growth of cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they were able to see that astrocytes had a direct role in [[Long-term potentiation]] with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.<ref name="ref36">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2431073100 | title = Contribution of astrocytes to hippocampal long-term potentiation through release of D-serine | year = 2003 | last1 = Yang | first1 = Y. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 25 | pages = 15194 }}</ref>

Recent studies have shown that astrocytes play an important function in the regulation of neural [[stem cell]]s. Research from the Schepens Eye Research Institute at [[Harvard]] shows the human brain to abound in neural stem cells, which are kept in a dormant state by [[neurotransmitter|chemical signals]] (ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3) from the astrocytes. The astrocytes are able to activate the stem cells to transform into working neurons by dampening the release of [[ephrin-A2]] and [[ephrin-A3]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Furthermore, studies are underway to determine whether astroglia play an instrumental role in depression, based on the link between [[diabetes]] and depression. Altered CNS [[glucose]] [[metabolism]] is seen in both these conditions, and the astroglial cells are the only cells with [[insulin]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] in the brain.

==Calcium waves==
Astrocytes are linked by [[gap junction]]s, creating an electrically coupled (functional) [[syncytium]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bennett M, Contreras J, Bukauskas F, S<U+00E1>ez J | title = New roles for astrocytes: gap junction hemichannels have something to communicate | journal = Trends Neurosci | volume = 26 | issue = 11 | pages = 610<U+2013>7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14585601 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2003.09.008}}</ref> Because of this ability of astrocytes to communicate with their neighbors, changes in the activity of one astrocyte can have repercussions on the activities of others that are quite distant from the original astrocyte.

An influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into astrocytes is the essential change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said to be a kind of [[hemodynamic response|hemodynamic response function]]. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and [[Inositol trisphosphate|IP3]] through gap junctions and [[P2RX7#Recruitment of pannexin|extracellular ATP signalling]].<ref>{{cite pmid|11264297}}</ref> Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Parpura V, Haydon P | title = Physiological astrocytic calcium levels stimulate glutamate release to modulate adjacent neurons | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 15 | pages = 8629<U+2013>34 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10900020 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.97.15.8629 | pmc = 26999}}</ref>

==Development==

Astrocytes are macroglial cells in the central nervous system. Astrocytes are derived from heterogeneous populations of progenitor cells in the neuroepithelium of the developing central nervous system. Recent works, summarized in a review by Rowitch and Kriegstein,<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature09611 | title=Developmental genetics of vertebrate glial<U+2013>cell specification | year=2010 | last1=Rowitch | first1=David H. | last2=Kriegstein | first2=Arnold R. | journal=Nature | volume=468 | issue=7321 | pages=214<U+2013>22 | pmid=21068830 }}</ref> indicate that there is remarkable similarity between the well known genetic mechanisms that specify the lineage of diverse [[neuron]] subtypes and that of macroglial cells. Just as with neuronal cell specification, canonical signaling factors like [[Sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), [[Fibroblast growth factor]] (FGFs), [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNTs]] and [[bone morphogenetic protein]]s (BMPs), provide positional information to developing macroglial cells through morphogen gradients along the dorsal<U+2013>ventral, anterior<U+2013>posterior and medial<U+2013>lateral axes. The resultant patterning along the neuraxis leads to segmentation of the neuroepithelium into progenitor domains (p0, p1 p2, p3 and pMN) for distinct neuron types in the developing spinal cord. On the basis of several studies it is now believed that that this model also applies to macroglial cell specification. Studies carried out by Hochstim and colleagues have demonstrated that three distinct populations of astrocytes arise from the p1, p2 and p3 domains.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16292311 | pages=360<U+2013>363 | year = 2005 | last1 = Muroyama | first1 = Y | last2 = Fujiwara | first2 = Y | last3 = Orkin | first3 = SH | last4 = Rowitch | first4 = DH | title = Specification of astrocytes by bHLH protein SCL in a restricted region of the neural tube | volume = 438 | issue = 7066 | doi = 10.1038/nature04139 | journal = Nature }}</ref> These subtypes of astrocytes can be identified on the basis of their expression of different transcription factors (PAX6, [[NKX6-1|NKX6.1]]) and cell surface markers ([[reelin]] and [[SLIT1]]).

==Classification==
There are several different ways to classify astrocytes.

===Lineage and antigenic phenotype===
These have been established by classic work by Raff et al. in early 1980s on Rat optic nerves.
* Type 1: Antigenically Ran2<sup>+</sup>, GFAP<sup>+</sup>, FGFR3<sup>+</sup>, A2B5<sup><U+2212></sup>, thus resembling the "type 1 astrocyte" of the postnatal day 7 rat optic nerve. These can arise from the tripotential glial restricted precursor cells (GRP), but not from the bipotential O2A/OPC (oligodendrocyte, type 2 astrocyte precursor, also called ''[[Oligodendrocyte precursor cell|Oligodendrocyte progenitor cell]]'') cells.
* Type 2: Antigenically A2B5<sup>+</sup>, GFAP<sup>+</sup>, FGFR3<sup><U+2212></sup>, Ran 2<sup><U+2212></sup>. These cells can develop ''in vitro'' from the either tripotential GRP (probably via O2A stage) or from bipotential O2A cells (which some people{{Who|date=March 2009}} think may in turn have been derived from the GRP) '''or''' in vivo when these progenitor cells are transplanted into lesion sites (but ''probably not in normal development, at least not in the rat optic nerve''). Type-2 astrocytes are the major astrocytic component in postnatal optic nerve cultures that are generated by O2A cells grown in the presence of fetal calf serum but are not thought to exist ''in vivo''.<ref>{{cite pmid|1281496}}</ref>

==Pathology==
[[Astrocytoma]]s are primary intracranial [[tumor]]s derived from astrocytes cells of the brain. It is also possible that glial progenitors or neural stem cells give rise to astrocytomas.

Astrocytomas are brain tumors that develop from astrocytes. They may occur in many parts of the brain and sometimes in the spinal cord. They can occur at any age and they primarily occur in males. Astrocytomas are divided into two categories: Low grade (I and II) and High Grade (III and IV).  Low grade tumors are more common in children and high grade tumors are more common in adults.<ref name="ref32">[http://www.irsa.org/astrocytoma.html Astrocytomas]. International RadioSurgery Association (2010).</ref>

[[Pilocytic astrocytoma]] are Grade I tumors. They are considered benign and slow growing tumors. Pilocytic astrocytomas frequently have cystic portions filled with fluid and a nodule, which is the solid portion. Most are located in the cerebellum.  Therefore, most symptoms are related to balance or coordination difficulties.<ref name="ref32"/>  They also occur more frequently in children and teens.<ref name="ref33">[http://www.aans.org/Patient%20Information/Conditions%20and%20Treatments/Astrocytoma%20Tumors.aspx Astrocytoma Tumors]. American Association of Neurological Surgeons (August 2005).</ref>

Grade II Tumors grow relatively slow but invade surrounding healthy tissue. Usually considered benign but can grow into malignant tumors. Other names that are used are Fibrillary or Protoplasmic astrocytomas. They are prevalent in younger people who are often present with seizures.<ref name="ref33"/>

Anaplastic astrocytoma is classified as grade III and are malignant tumors. They grow more rapidly than lower grade tumors and tend to invade nearby healthy tissue. Anaplastic astrocytomas recur more frequently than lower grade tumors because of their tendency to spread into surrounding tissue makes them difficult to completely remove surgically.<ref name="ref32"/>

Glioblastoma Multiforme is also a malignant tumor and classified as a grade IV.  Glioblastomas can contain more than one cell type (i.e., astrocytes, oligondroctyes). Also, while one cell type may die off in response to a particular treatment, the other cell types may continue to multiply. Glioblastomas are the most invasive type of glial tumors.  Grows rapidly and spreads to nearby tissue. Approximately 50% of astrocytomas are glioblastomas and are very difficult to treat.<ref name="ref32"/>

== Tripartite synapse ==

Within the dorsal horn of the [[spinal cord]], activated astrocytes have the ability to respond to almost all [[neurotransmitters]]<ref name=Haydon2001>{{cite journal|last1=Haydon|first1=Philip G.|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=2|issue=3|year=2001|pages=185<U+2013>193|pmid=11256079|doi=10.1038/35058528|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tjrinne/artikkeleita_neuroI/haydon_nrn2001_glia.pdf |title=Glia: listening and talking to the synapse}}</ref> and, upon activation, release a multitude of neuroactive molecules such as [[glutamate]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[prostaglandins]] (PG), and [[D-serine]], which in turn influences neuronal excitability. The close association between astrocytes and [[presynaptic]] and [[postsynaptic]] terminals as well as their ability to integrate synaptic activity and release neuromodulators has been termed the "tripartite synapse".<ref name=Araque/> Synaptic modulation by astrocytes takes place because of this 3-part association.

== Astrocytes in chronic pain sensitization ==

Under normal conditions, pain conduction begins with some noxious signal followed by an action potential carried by [[nociceptive]] (pain sensing) afferent neurons, which elicit [[excitatory postsynaptic potentials]] (EPSP) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. That message is then relayed to the [[cerebral cortex]], where we translate those EPSPs into "pain". Since the discovery of astrocytic influence, our understanding of the conduction of pain has been dramatically complicated. Pain processing is no longer seen as a repetitive relay of signals from body to brain, but as a complex system that can be up- and down-regulated by a number of different factors. One factor at the forefront of recent research is in the pain-potentiating synapse located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the role of astrocytes in encapsulating these synapses. Garrison and co-workers<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Garrison|first1=C.J.|last2=Dougherty|first2=P.M.|last3=Kajander|first3=K.C.|last4=Carlton|first4=S.M.|title=Staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in lumbar spinal cord increases following a sciatic nerve constriction injury|journal=Brain Research|volume=565|issue=1|year=1991|pages=1<U+2013>7|pmid=1723019|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(91)91729-K}}</ref> were the first to suggest association when they found a correlation between astrocyte [[hypertrophy]] in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and hypersensitivity to pain after peripheral nerve injury, typically considered an indicator of glial activation after injury.
Astrocytes detect neuronal activity and can release chemical transmitters, which in turn control synaptic activity.<ref name=Haydon2001/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Volterra, A. and Meldolesi, J. |year= 2005 | title= Astrocytes, from brain glue to communication elements: the revolution continues | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience  | volume = 6|pages= 626<U+2013>640 | doi = 10.1038/nrn1722 | pmid = 16025096 | issue = 8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Halassa, M.M., Fellin, T., and Haydon, P.G. |year= 2006 | title= The tripartite synapse: roles for gliotransmission in health and disease | journal = Trends in Mol. Sci | volume =  13|pages=  54<U+2013>63 |pmid=17207662 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2006.12.005}}</ref> In the past, [[hyperalgesia]] was thought to be modulated by the release of [[substance P]] and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as [[glutamate]], from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of [[AMPA]] (<U+03B1>-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), [[NMDA]] (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and [[kainate]] subtypes of ionotropic [[glutamate receptor]]s follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction.  A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as [[calcitonin gene-related peptide]] (CGRP), [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF), [[somatostatin]], [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]] (VIP), [[galanin]], and [[vasopressin]] are all synthesized and released in response to [[noxious stimulus|noxious stimuli]]. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.

== Two states of persistent pain ==

After persistent peripheral tissue damage there is a release of several factors from the injured tissue as well as in the spinal dorsal horn. These factors increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn pain-projection neurons to ensuing stimuli, termed "spinal sensitization," thus amplifying the pain impulse to the brain. Release of glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) mediates NMDAR activation (originally silent because it is plugged by Mg2+), thus aiding in depolarization of the postsynaptic pain-transmitting neurons (PTN). In addition, activation of IP3 signaling and [[MAPK]]s (mitogen-activated protein kinases) such as [[Extracellular signal-regulated kinases|ERK]] and [[JNK]], bring about an increase in the synthesis of inflammatory factors that alter glutamate transporter function. ERK also further activates AMPARs and NMDARs in neurons. [[Nociception]] is further sensitized by the association of ATP and substance P with their respective receptors (P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3</sub>) and [[neurokinin 1 receptor]] (NK1R), as well as activation of [[metabotropic glutamate receptors]] and release of BDNF. Persistent presence of glutamate in the synapse eventually results in dysregulation of [[GLT1]] and [[Glutamate aspartate transporter|GLAST]], crucial transporters of glutamate into astrocytes. Ongoing excitation can also induce ERK and JNK activation, resulting in release of several inflammatory factors.

As noxious pain is sustained, spinal sensitization creates [[Transcriptional regulation|transcriptional changes]] in the neurons of the dorsal horn that lead to altered function for extended periods. Mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from internal stores results from persistent synaptic activity and leads to the release of glutamate, ATP, tumor necrosis factor-<U+03B1> (TNF-<U+03B1>), interleukin 1<U+03B2> ([[Interleukin 1 family|IL-1<U+03B2>]]), IL-6, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Activated astrocytes are also a source of [[matrix metalloproteinase]] 2 ([[MMP2]]), which induces [[Pyroptosis|pro-IL-1<U+03B2>]] cleavage and sustains astrocyte activation. In this chronic signaling pathway, p38 is activated as a result of [[Interleukin 1 family|IL-1<U+03B2>]] signaling, and there is a presence of chemokines that trigger their receptors to become active. In response to nerve damage, [[heat shock proteins]] (HSP) are released and can bind to their respective [[Toll-like receptor|TLR]]s, leading to further activation.
