[[Image:JosefMengele1.jpg|thumb|right|The lyrics of "Angel of Death" were inspired by the acts of Josef Mengele during World War II]]
"'''Angel of Death'''" is the [[opening track]] on the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]]'s 1986 album ''[[Reign in Blood]]''. The lyrics were written by Slayer guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]]; based on [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] physician [[Josef Mengele]], who conducted [[human experiments]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]. "Angel of Death" led to the band facing accusations of Nazi sympathizing and [[racism]] throughout their career.

Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of ''Reign in Blood'', "Angel of Death" is featured on all of Slayer's [[live album]]s and [[DVD]]s, and has appeared on the [[soundtrack]]s of several movies. "Angel of Death" was well received by critics, and [[All Music Guide]] described it as a "classic."<ref name="Reign in Blood - Review ">{{cite web

== Composition and origins ==
"Angel of Death"'s lyrics and music was written by Slayer guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]], after reading two books on Nazi physician [[Josef Mengele]] while on tour with Slayer.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> "I remember stopping some place where I bought two books on Mengele. I thought, 'This has gotta be some sick shit.' So when it came time to do the record, that stuff was still in my head<U+2014>that<U+2019>s where the lyrics to <U+201C>Angel of Death<U+201D> came from."<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> 

The lyrics detail Mengele's surgical experiments on patients at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="SLAYER's KING Says RICK RUBIN's Collaboration With METALLICA Was 'Slap In The Face'">{{cite web

==Controversy==
"Angel of Death"'s lyrical content contributed to the delay in the release of Slayer's 1986 album ''[[Reign in Blood]]''. The band were signed to [[Def Jam Records]] whose distributor, [[Columbia Records]], refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns, deeming the artwork "too graphic".<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> ''Reign in Blood'' was eventually distributed by [[Geffen Records]] on [[October 7]], [[1986]]. However, due to the controversy, ''Reign in Blood'' did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer"/> 

"Angel of Death" caused outrage among survivors of the [[Holocaust]], as well as their families and the general public. The controversy lead to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career.<ref name="An exclusive oral history of Slayer">{{cite web

==Reception==

Although "Angel of Death" was not released as a single, it received strong praise from critics in reviews for ''Reign in Blood''. Clay Jarvas of [[Stylus Magazine]] noted that the song "smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today.

Adrien Begrand of ''[[Popmatters]]'' remarked that "There's no better song to kick things off than the masterful "Angel of Death", one of the most monumental songs in metal history, where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs, drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded, and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Joseph Mengele."<ref name="The Devil in Music">{{cite web

Capitalizing on the publicity generated by the controversy, the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the [[eagle atop swastika]], during the ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'' period.
