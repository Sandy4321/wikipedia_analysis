The '''Omagh bombing''' was a [[car bomb]] attack carried out by the [[Real IRA]] on [[August 15]], [[1998]], in [[Omagh]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The Real IRA comprises a splinter group of former [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] members opposed to the peace process marked by the [[Belfast Agreement]]. Twenty-nine people were killed as a result of the attack, including one woman who was pregnant with twins, and approximately 220 people were injured.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/152156.stm|title=Omagh bombing kills 28|date=[[1998-08-16]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The attack has been described as "Northern Ireland's worst single terrorist atrocity".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/524462.stm|title=Bravery awards for bomb helpers|date=[[1999-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

The victims included people of both Catholic and Protestant denominations, and also included [[Spain|Spanish]] tourists and others on a day trip from [[County Donegal]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Chronology==
*The [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] carrying the bomb, was parked outside a clothes shop on Omagh's Market Street at 2.00pm. It had previously been stolen in [[Carrickmacross]], [[County Monaghan]] a week before, it then had its [[Irish vehicle registration plates|Republic of Ireland number plates]] replaced with [[British car number plates#Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] plates.  The driver and another occupant left the car and walked down Campsie Road.
*At 2.30pm the first warning was received by an employee of [[UTV]] in [[Belfast]]. After passing the information to the RUC, the employee received another warning three minutes later. At the same time another warning was given to the Coleraine office of the [[Samaritans]].
*At 3:10pm the bomb detonated.

==Warnings==
On the day of the bombing, three warnings were recorded and reported:

Received by Ulster Television at 14:30
:''"There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500 pounds, explosion 30 minutes."'' 

Received by the [[Coleraine]] office of the '[[Samaritans]]' charity at 14:32
:''"Am I through to Omagh? This is a bomb warning. It's going to go off in 30 minutes."'' (followed possibly by further pieces of information not recorded, including that the location of the bomb was allegedly 200 yards from the courthouse).

Received by [[Ulster Television]] at 14:35
:''"Bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/omagh/before.html|title=Before the Bomb - 15 August, 1998|first=Wesley|last=Johnston|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>

There has been considerable debate about the subject of these warnings, the tapes of some warnings have not been released to the public, and some information about the location of the bomb may have been recorded incorrectly or ignored. Several warnings mentioned that the bomb was 200&nbsp;yards away from the courthouse, the actual bombing was between 300-400&nbsp;yards from the Courthouse.

==Police Ombudsman Report==
The [[Police Ombudsman]], [[Nuala O'Loan]], strongly criticised the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) over their handling of the investigation. Her report stated that RUC officers had ignored previous warnings about a bomb and had failed to act on crucial intelligence. She went on to say that officers had been uncooperative and defensive during her inquiry into the investigation. RUC officers had been seen moving people towards the bomb, which they claimed was because the warnings had been for the Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/ombudsman/po121201omagh1.pdf|title=Statement by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland on her Investigation of matters relating to the Omagh Bomb on August 15, 1998|date=[[2001-12-12]]|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> On [[24 February]], [[2006]], it was alleged that an agent paid by [[MI5]] and the [[FBI]], knew of the plan to bomb Omagh, but that MI5 never passed this information to police.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0224/omagh.html|title=MI5 withheld intelligence ahead of Omagh|date=[[2006-02-24]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[RT<U+00C9> News]]}}</ref>

The Mirror report that initially, the Police Association, which represents senior officers and rank and file members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), went to court to try to block the release of the O'Loan report, but dropped their efforts after being given more time to review the report before its release to the public.  

However Chief Constable [[Ronnie Flanagan]] stated that the multiple warnings were given to cause confusion and ultimately a greater loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/omagh/police_press_releases.html|title=Appendix B: Police Press Releases on the Omagh Bomb|first=Wesley|last=Johnston|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> Flanagan resigned following the O'Loan report.

==Responsibility==
After the attack the Real IRA claimed "minimal responsibility" for bombing the courthouse at Omagh, and later released a statement claiming two [[MI5]] agents were largely responsible for the bombing.

The [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (British television series)|Panorama]]'' programme, ''Who Bombed Omagh?'', shown in [[2000]], gave the names of the prime suspects as [[S<U+00E9>amus McKenna]], [[Michael McKevitt]], [[Liam Campbell]], [[Colm Murphy]], and [[Seamus Daly]]. It is believed that the bombing of [[4 March 2001 BBC bombing|BBC Television Centre]] in [[London]] was a revenge attack for the broadcast.

Builder and [[publican]] Murphy, from [[County Louth]], was charged and convicted in [[2001]] by the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic's]] [[Special Criminal Court]] for "conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause injury". He was sentenced to fourteen years. In January 2005, Murphy's conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered by the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], on the grounds that two [[An Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na|Garda<U+00ED>]] had falsified interview notes, and that Murphy's previous convictions were improperly taken into account by the trial judges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0121/omagh.html|title=Relatives disappointed with Omagh ruling|date=[[2005-01-21]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[RT<U+00C9> News]]}}</ref>

Many of the others were later sued in a civil action by the relatives of people killed in the bombing, including the families of James Barker, 12, Samantha McFarland, 17, Lorraine Wilson, 15, and 20-month-old Breda Devine.

==Memorials==
The bombing inspired the song "Paper Sun", by rock group [[Def Leppard]], as noted in the commentary of their album ''Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection''.

Another song inspired by the bombings was "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]", by rock group [[U2]], and includes the line "They're reading names out over the radio. All the folks the rest of us won't get to know. Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann, and Breda." The 5 names mentioned are five of the victims from this attack. Another Line, "She never got to say goodbye, To see the colour in his eyes, now he's in the dirt", was about how James Barker, a victim, was remembered by his mother Donna Maria Barker in an article in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' after the bombing in Omagh.

Omagh maintains a [[memorial garden]] in the town centre.
