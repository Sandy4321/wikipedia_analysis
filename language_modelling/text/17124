'''Microsoft Corporation''' is an American [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells [[computer software]], [[consumer electronics]] and [[personal computers]] and services. Its best known software products are the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of [[operating systems]], [[Microsoft Office]] [[office suite]], and [[Internet Explorer]] [[web browser]]. Its flagship hardware products are [[Xbox]] game console and the [[Microsoft Surface]] series of tablets. It is the [[List of the largest software companies|world's largest software maker]] measured by revenues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretop100.org/global-software-top-100-edition-2011 |title=Global Software Top 100 - Edition 2011 |publisher=Softwaretop100.Org|date=23 August 2011}}</ref> It is also one of the [[List of corporations by market capitalization|world's most valuable companies]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ycharts.com/rankings/market_cap | title=Market Cap Rankings | publisher=Zacks Investment Research | work=Ycharts | date=April 8, 2012 | accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

Microsoft was founded by [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreters]] for [[Altair 8800]]. It rose to dominate the [[personal computer]] [[operating system]] market with [[MS-DOS]] in the mid-1980s, followed by the [[Microsoft Windows]]. The company's 1986 [[initial public offering]], and subsequent rise in its share price, created an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. It is considered the third most successful startup company of all time by market capitalization, revenue, growth and cultural impact.<ref name="Top 20 Startups">{{cite web|last=Hunckler|first=Matt|title=Top 20 Startups of All Time|url=http://vergestartups.com/top-20-startups-of-all-time/|publisher=Verge Startups|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref>   Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|made a number of corporate acquisitions]]. In May 2011, Microsoft acquired [[Skype Technologies]] for $8.5 billion in its largest acquisition to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchofficespace.com/blog/sos-news/microsoft-buys-skype-for-8-5-billion.html |title=Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5 billion |publisher=The Search Office Space Blog |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref>

As of 2013, Microsoft is market dominant in both the [[IBM PC-compatible]] operating system and [[office software suite]] markets (the latter with [[Microsoft Office]]). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including [[Web search engine|internet search]] (with [[Bing]]), the [[video game industry]] (with the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] consoles), the digital services market (through [[MSN]]), and mobile phones (via the [[Windows Phone]] OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the [[Microsoft Surface]], a line of [[tablet computer]]s.

[[Paul Allen]] and [[Bill Gates]], childhood friends with a passion in [[computer programming]], were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. In 1972 they founded their first company named [[Traf-O-Data]], which offered a rudimentary computer that tracked and analyzed automobile traffic data. Allen went on to pursue a degree in computer science at the University of Washington, later dropping out of school to work at Honeywell. Gates began studies at Harvard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft Company HIstory|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/microsoft-corporation-history/}}</ref>  The January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' featured [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]]'s (MITS) [[Altair 8800]] [[microcomputer]]. Allen noticed that they could program a [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, Allen worked on a [[simulation|simulator]] for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as [[Altair BASIC]].<ref name="Allan 2001" />{{rp|108, 112<U+2013>114|date=November 2012}} They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].<ref name="BBCTL">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A Timeline|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=July 15, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> Allen came up with the original name of "Micro-Soft," the combination of the words microcomputer and software, as recounted in a [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm 1995 Fortune magazine article]. In August 1977 the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office, "[[ASCII (company)|ASCII Microsoft]]".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n8/192_Kay_Nishi_bridges_the_cul.php|title=Kay Nishi bridges the cultural gap|author=Staples, Betsy|journal=Creative Computing|volume=10|issue=8|page=192|date=August 1984|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref> The company moved to a new home in [[Bellevue, Washington]] in January 1979.<ref name="BBCTL" />

After negotiations with [[Digital Research]] failed, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the [[CP/M]] OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k9xS6t4ibxoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Engines+that+move+markets:+technology+investing+from+railroads+to+the&hl=en&ei=BJThTfsoiK3yA4bgoJQH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=november%201980&f=false |title=Engines that move markets |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called [[86-DOS]] from [[Seattle Computer Products]], branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to [[PC DOS]]. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM [[copyright]]ed the IBM PC [[BIOS]], other companies had to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as [[IBM PC compatible]]s, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems.

On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part:
"Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive "per processor" licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f0000/0045.htm |title=Competitive Impact Statement : U.S. v.

Criticism of Microsoft has followed the company's existence because of various aspects of its products and business practices. [[Ease of use]], [[wikt:stability|stability]], and [[computer security|security]] of the company's software are common targets for critics. More recently, [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]] and other exploits have plagued numerous users due to faults in the security of Microsoft Windows and other programs. Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors into their products, and not following and complying with existing standards in its software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in}}</ref> [[Total cost of ownership]] comparisons of [[Linux]] as well as [[Mac OS X|OS X]] to Windows are a continuous point of debate.

The company has been in numerous [[lawsuits]] by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the [[European Union]] found Microsoft guilty in a highly publicized [[anti-trust]] case. Additionally, Microsoft's [[EULA]] for some of its programs is often criticized as being too restrictive as well as being against [[open source]] software.

Microsoft has been criticized (along with [[Yahoo]], [[AOL]], [[Google]] and others) for its involvement in [[censorship in the People's Republic of China]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/ | title=Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship | accessdate=2006-11-23}}</ref> Microsoft has also come under criticism for [[Offshoring|outsourcing jobs]] to China and [[India]].<ref>"[http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/whos-buying-microsofts-outsourcing-excuses-390 Who's buying Microsoft's outsourcing excuses?]".

Baker stated "The new logo, in [[Helvetica]] italic typeface, has a slash between the ''o'' and ''s'' to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed."<ref>{{Cite journal|work=Computer Reseller News Magazine|date=March 1987}}</ref> Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter ''O'', nicknamed the ''blibbet'', but it was discarded.<ref name="Osterman2005-07-14">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx|title=Remember the blibbet|work=Larry Osterman's WebLog|publisher=Microsoft|author=Osterman, Larry|date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}</ref> Microsoft's logo with the "''Your potential.
