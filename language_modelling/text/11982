A [[mid-air collision]] occurred over [[Brocklesby, New South Wales|Brocklesby]], New South Wales, Australia, on 29&nbsp;September 1940. The accident was unusual in that the aircraft involved, two [[Avro Anson]]s of [[No.&nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School RAAF]], remained locked together after colliding, and then managed to land safely. Both navigators bailed out after the aircraft struck, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower Anson. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, found that he was able to control the interlocked aircraft using his [[aileron]]s and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], coupled with the still-functioning engines on the machine underneath. He was then able to make a successful emergency landing in a [[Field (agriculture)|paddock]] near Brocklesby. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the Ansons were repaired and remained in service with the Air Force.

[[No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Service Flying Training School]] (No.&nbsp;2 SFTS), based at [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Station Forest Hill]] near [[Wagga Wagga]], New South Wales, was one of twenty new pilot training facilities formed during World War&nbsp;II in response to Australia's participation in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]].<ref name="2SFTS">RAAF Historical Section, ''Units of the Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 102&ndash;103</ref><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 111]</ref> Having undergone basic aeronautical instruction at an Elementary Flying Training School, pupils received further instruction at SFTS that focussed on techniques they would require as operational (or "service") pilots, including instrument flying, night flying, cross-country navigation, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery.<ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 67&ndash;70</ref><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp. 97, 109]</ref> No.&nbsp;2 SFTS's facilities were still under construction when its first course commenced with [[Avro Anson]]s on 29&nbsp;July 1940.<ref name="2SFTS"/><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/02.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', p. 56]</ref>

The Ansons were at an altitude of {{convert|1000|ft|m||abbr=none}} over the township of [[Brocklesby, New South Wales|Brocklesby]], near [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], when they made a banking turn.<ref name="Flypast"/><ref name="Renown"/> Fuller lost sight of Hewson's aircraft beneath him and the two Ansons collided amid a "grinding crunch of metal and tearing of fabric".<ref name="Renown"/> They remained jammed together, Fuller's Anson "piggybacking" Hewson's. Both of the upper aircraft's engines had been knocked out in the collision but those of the one below continued to turn at full power as the interlocked Ansons began to slowly circle.<ref name="Hatching"/><ref name="Renown"/> Fuller found that he was able to control the "crazily coupled" aircraft with his [[aileron]]s and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], and began searching for a place to land.<ref name="Renown"/><ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/04.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp. 82&ndash;83]</ref> The two navigators, Sinclair and Fraser, bailed out, followed soon after by the lower Anson's pilot, Hewson, whose back had been injured when the propeller of the other plane sliced through his fuselage.<ref name="2SFTS"/><ref name="Renown"/> 

Having travelled five miles (eight kilometres) since the collision, Fuller successfully made an emergency 'pancake' landing in a large [[Field (agriculture)|paddock]] four miles south-west of Brocklesby, coming to rest after sliding some {{convert|200|yd|m||abbr=none}} across the grass.<ref name="Flypast"/><ref name="Renown"/> As far as Fuller was concerned, the touchdown was better than any he had made when practising 'circuits and bumps' at Forest Hill airfield the previous day. His acting commanding officer, Squadron Leader Cooper, declared the choice of improvised runway "perfect", and the landing itself as a "wonderful effort".<ref name="Hatching"/> The RAAF's Inspector of Air Accidents, Group Captain [[Arthur William Murphy|Arthur "Spud" Murphy]] was quickly on the scene, along with his deputy [[Henry Winneke]]. Fuller told Murphy:<ref name="Renown"/>

{{cquote|Well, sir, I did everything we've been told to do in a forced landing&mdash;land as close as possible to habitation or a farmhouse and, if possible, land into the wind. I did all that. There's the farmhouse, and I did a couple of circuits and landed into the wind. She was pretty heavy on the controls, though!}}

==Aftermath==
[[File:SUK10426BruceFuller1941.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Sergeant Fuller (right) with Australian High Commissioner [[Stanley Bruce]] in London, 1941|alt=Two men talking, one in dark overcoat with broad-brimmed hat, the other in dark military uniform with forage cap]]
The "freak flying experience" garnered news coverage around the world, and put Brocklesby "on the map".<ref name="Hatching"/><ref name="Renown"/> By preventing the Ansons from crashing, Fuller was credited not only with sparing Brocklesby possible destruction, but also with saving approximately [[Australian pound|<U+00A3>]]40,000 worth of military hardware.<ref name="Hatching"/><ref name="Renown"/> Both aircraft were repaired, the top plane (N4876) returning to flight service, and the lower (L9162) being used as an Instructional Airframe.<ref name="Flypast"/><ref name="Renown"/> Hewson was treated for his back injury at [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury District Hospital]] and returned to active duty, graduating from No.&nbsp;2 SFTS in October 1940.<ref name="Hatching"/><ref name="Renown"/> He was discharged from the Air Force as a [[Flight Lieutenant]] in 1946.<ref name="WW2Hewson"/> Sinclair had discharged the previous year, also a Flight Lieutenant.<ref name="WW2Sinclair"/> Fraser was posted to England and served with [[No.&nbsp;206 Squadron RAF]]. He died on 1&nbsp;January 1942 during a routine training flight, when his [[Lockheed Hudson]] collided with a tree.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/catalogue/research_centre/pdf/rc09125z007_1.pdf RAAF Personnel Serving on Attachment in Royal Air Force Squadrons, p. 14] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 28 February 2011.</ref> 

Fuller was promoted to [[sergeant]] after his successful landing, but also confined to barracks for fourteen days, reportedly for speaking without authorisation to the newspapers.<ref name="Renown"/> Graduating from No.&nbsp;2 SFTS in October 1940, he went on to serve first in the Middle East, and then in Europe with [[No.&nbsp;37 Squadron RAF]], earning the [[Distinguished Flying Medal]] for his actions over [[Palermo]], Italy, in 1942. He was commissioned soon after receiving the award, and subsequently posted back to Australia as a [[Flying Officer]], becoming an instructor at [[No. 1 Operational Training Unit RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Operational Training Unit]] in [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], Victoria.<ref name="Hatching"/><ref name="Gillison"/> Fuller died near Sale on 18&nbsp;March 1944, when the bicycle he was riding collided with a bus.<ref name="Renown"/><ref name="Gillison"/> 

On 26&nbsp;January 2007, a memorial to the 1940 collision featuring an Avro Anson engine was opened as part of Brocklesby's [[Australia Day]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite web| last=Mulcahy|first=Mark| title=Gala double for couple| date= 27 January 2007| url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/gala-double-for-couple/461771.aspx|work=[[The Border Mail]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]| accessdate=on 2 March 2011}}</ref>
