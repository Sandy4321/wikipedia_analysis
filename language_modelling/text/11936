===2007 season===
{{see|2007 Kansas City Chiefs season}}
In the 2007 preseason, the Vikings hosted the Rams.<ref name="A Different Kind"/> Chiefs scout and vice president of player personnel [[Bill Kuharich]] attended the game at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]].<ref name="A Different Kind"/> Thigpen played in the fourth quarter and in two possessions with the Vikings offense and completed 3-of-6 passes for 29 yards and picked up 18 yards on two scrambles.<ref name="A Different Kind"/> Kuharich filed a scouting a report following the game and told the rest of the Chiefs personnel to keep an eye on Thigpen if he were to be released after the preseason.<ref name="A Different Kind"/>

On [[May 18]], [[2007]], Thigpen became the first of eight Vikings drafted in 2007 to sign a contract, agreeing to a four-year deal.<ref name="Tyler Thigpen biography"/><ref name="StarTrib"/> Thigpen then competed with [[Brooks Bollinger]], [[Tarvaris Jackson]], and [[Drew Henson]] for a quarterback roster spot for the [[2007 NFL season]].<ref name="StarTrib"/>  The Vikings released Thigpen on [[September 1]], [[2007]] thinking they could add him on their practice squad after passing waivers but he was signed by the Chiefs the following day.<ref name="Tyler Thigpen biography">{{cite web | title=Tyler Thigpen biography | url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/player/tyler_thigpen/ | publisher=Kansas City Chiefs | accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref>

===2008 season===

In Thigpen's second career start, he passed for 280 yards with a 69.4% completion rate, with two touchdowns and no interceptions against the [[New York Jets]], nearly leading the Chiefs to win over the heavily-favored Jets.<ref name="Favre connects">{{cite web | title=Favre connects with Coles in final minute to lift Jets to win | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=281026020 | author=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2008-10-26 | accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref> With the newly installed spread offense, the Chiefs had four or five pass plays and two or three runs.<ref name="Spread changes"/>
