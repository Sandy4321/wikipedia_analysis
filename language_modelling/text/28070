The '''Geography of [[Franz Josef Land]]''' refers to an island group belonging to [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] of [[Russia]]. It is situated in the [[Barents Sea]] of the [[Arctic]], north of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and east of [[Svalbard]]. At latitudes between [[80th parallel north|80.0<U+00B0>]] and 81.9<U+00B0> north, it is the most northerly group of islands associated with [[Eurasia]]. The extreme northernmost point is [[Cape Fligely]] on [[Rudolf Island]]. The archipelago consists of 191 ice-covered [[island]]s with a total area of {{convert|16134|km<U+00B2>|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is currently uninhabited. The archipelago is only {{convert|900|to|1110|km|mi|abbr=in}} from the North Pole, and the northernmost islands are closer to the Pole than any other land except for Canada's [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]]. The largest island is [[Zemlya Georga]] (George Land) which measures {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} from end to end. The highest point in the archipelago is on Ostrov Viner-Neyshtadt ([[Wiener Neustadt Island]]) which reaches {{convert|620|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The central cluster of large islands in the midst of the archipelago forms a compact whole, known as [[Zichy Land]], where islands are separated from each other by very narrow sounds that are frozen most of the year.

During the period 1926 and 1932 Franz Josef Land also known in Russian as ''Zemlya Franca Josepha'' became a part of the Soviet Union and is included under the [[Archangel Oblast]]. In 1994, it was declared the [[Sakasnik Nature Reserve]] covering an area of {{Convert|42000|km2}} including area of the sea surrounding the land but with restricted entry only on special permit which is not given easily; out of this area, {{Convert|50|km2}} area around the military base of [[Nagurskoe]] on the [[Alexander Island]] is totally out of bounds.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=206}}

==Waterways==
Markham Sound is a [[waterway]] between Zichy Land and the islands of McClintock and Hall.{{sfn|Heilprin|1990|1122}} West of the British Channel is Prince George Land.{{sfn|Heilprin|1990|1494}} Alexandra Land contains Weyprecht Bay.{{sfn|Heilprin|1990|1993}} West of Austria Sound is Zichy Land.{{sfn|Heilprin|1990|2049}} Immediately north of Franz Josef Land is the Queen Victoria Sea.{{sfn|Heilprin|1990|1510}}

==Geology==
Two distinct geological formations identified are of the [[Late Triassic]] and [[Jurasic]] sedimentary process which are recorded to a depth of {{Convert|200|m}} at [[Cape Flora]] and it recedes gradually towards the  coast line of the sea in the north. Fossilized tree trunks here attest to this assessment. Above the Jurassic sedimentary layer of {{Convert|500|m}}  thickness, which is [[basalt]]ic, cretaceous period intrusions of [[dolerite]] caused by volcanic eruptions are recorded. Also seen are many fault zones which have contributed to the removal of volcanic layers and exposing plateau tops and rock walls. Another feature noted here is of the shore line which appears to have receded, as a result of island formations (the rise of the islands above the icy sea is reported to be {{Convert|2|-|3|mm}}  per year).{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=191}} Though most of the land is covered by [[glacial ice]], it does have outcrops covered with [[moss]]. The northeastern part of the archipelago is locked in [[pack ice]] most of the year round; however the ice sometimes retreats north past the islands in summer (September).

==Climate==
Climatic conditions here are very severe with lowest temperature touching minus (-)25<U+00B0>C to (-) 30<U+00B0>C during winter; even in summers the temperature does not rise above {{Convert|0|C|F}}. The polar nights lasts for 125 days while the polar days are 140.<ref name=National/> Climatically none of the Gulf Streams touch  the 75 islands of the Franz Josef Land. While [[Polynias]] are the wind and sea currents that prevail in the northern and southern part of the land mass, which are the causative factors for the large ice free zone in the sea, the eastern and northern winds cause very cold breeze. The rainfall in the land varies between {{Convert|100|mm}} and 300 mm {{Convert|300|mm}} but mostly in the form of snow.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|pp=192-93}}

==Landforms==
[[File:Champ insel geode.jpg|right|thumb|Landform of Geode (spherical rocks) on Champ Island, Franz Josef Land]]
The group of islands of the archipelago is located at the nearest about {{Convert|900|km}} from the [[North Pole]], much beyond the [[Polar Circle]]. The group<U+2019>s 191 islands measure {{Convert|16135|km2}}. They extend over a length of {{Convert|234|km}} in the north-south direction and {{convert|350|km}} in the east-west direction.{{sfn|L<U+00FC>ck|2008|p=182}} There are flat mountains in the range of {{Convert|400|-|490|m}} above sea level. The general lie of the land is in the elevation range between {{Convert|300|m}}  in the north and {{Convert|600|m}}  in the south with [[Wilsczek Land]] forming the highest land mass at an elevation of {{Convert|670|m}}.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|pp=191-93}}  The islands are covered with glaciers to the extent of 85%, with no land breaks, and the land area of all the islands is only about 20%, with a coastline measuring {{Convert|4425|km}}.{{sfn|L<U+00FC>ck|2008|p=182}} There are multiple [[icebergs]], with limited length of less than {{Convert|400|m}} and some of them are similar to the Antarctic [[tabular iceberg]]. Air borne radar measurements have recorded an ice layer of {{Convert|400|m}}  in Graham Bell and Hall Islands; the thick ice cover on the islands is a phenomenon of the last 1000 years and as result the [[reindeer]] population has not survived in these islands. Moving down to the coastal region, where the ice disappears, many lakes and ponds are seen. But as this area is very limited only small streams are noted and the largest one is only {{Convert|19|km}} on the George Prince Island.{{sfn|L<U+00FC>ck|2008|p=182}}<ref name=National>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/2011/08/franz-josef-land-national-geographic-explorer-makes-history/|title=Franz Josef Land: National Geographic Explorer Makes History: Field Notes|date=10 April 2011|publisher=National Geographic Expeditions}}</ref>

To the north of this and off the east coast of Zemlya  Georga is the [[British Channel]], which has [[Hooker Island]] to the far southeast. Zemlya Georga has several capes on its northern end, including [[Cape Murray]] on the northeastern peninsula, [[Cape Bruce]] on the north-northeastern peninsula, and [[Cape Battenberg]] on the northern peninsula, marking the northernmost point of the island. Several streams during the summer season flow into the sea in the northwestern side, and [[Geograher Bay]] divides the northeastern and north-north eastern peninsulas. Off the north coast, [[Leigh Smith Sound]] separates Zemlya George from the small [[Arthur Island]], which has a peak of {{convert|275|m}} and the [[Cape Ice Reconnaissance]] on its northern coast.<ref name=Prince/>

;Hooker Island
[[Hooker Island]], named after British naturalist Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], lies to the southeast of Zemlya Georga, across the British Channel. It has an area of {{Convert|459.8|km2}}  and lies within latitude 80.25<U+00BA> N and longitude 53.00<U+00BA> E. The highest point on the island is at elevation {{Convert|576|m}} and its mapped shore length is {{Convert|117.5|km}}.<ref name=Islands/> A graveyard and two modern buildings exist. On Hooker Island's western side there is a bay in an unglaciated area, [[Hooker Island|Tikhaya Bay]] {{Coord|80|20|N|52|47|E|}}). A large [[seabird colony]] exists near Tikhaya Bay at Skala Rubini {{Coord|80|18|N|52|50|E|}}), a spectacular rock formation on Hooker Island's shore. Tikhaya Bay was the site of a major base for [[Arctic exploration|polar expeditions]], and the location of a [[meteorological station]] from 1929 to 1963. There is another bay in the south of the island called Zaliv Makarova and another in the east known as Ledn. Eleniy. To the southwest, [[De Bruyne Sound]] separates the island from [[Northbrook Island]]. To the north, [[Young Sound]] separates the island from the islands of Koettlitz and Namsen, Pritchet, and several others.<ref name=Hook>{{Cite web|url= http://www.franz-josef-land.info/index.php?id=650&L=5|title= Hooker (Gukera) Island, Rubini Rock, Tikhaya Station - Franz Josef Land|accessdate=16 July 2013|publisher= Franz-Josef-Land info}}</ref>

There are a number of islands surrounding Hooker Island. Scott-Keltie Island, with a highest point of {{convert|64|m}}, is an island off the northwest coast, and is named in honor of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geographer Sir [[John Scott Keltie]] (1840-1927). {{Convert|10|km}} beyond this, lying to the west of Scott-Keltie Island in the British Channel, is Eaton Island, a small, {{convert|3|km}} long island. This island, which appears as Ostrov Itol in many Russian maps, was named after British scientist Rev. [[Alfred Edvin Eaton]] (1844-1929). May Island is a small island lying {{convert|5|km}} off the south coast; to the southwest of this [[Etheridge Island]], and to the southeast of is [[Newton Island]], {{convert|11|km}} offshore, named in honor of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Leigh-Smith Island lies east of Hooker island, separated from it by a {{convert|6|km}} wide sound called Proliv Smitsona. It is {{convert|14|km}} long and has a maximum width of {{convert|6.5|km}}. The island's highest point is {{convert|309|m}} and its surface is wholly glacierized except for a small area at its northern point and another around Mys Bitterburga', its southermost cape. This island is named after British yachtsman and explorer [[Benjamin Leigh Smith]]. West of Leigh-Smith Island's northern end, off Hooker island's northeastern shore, there is a smaller island known as Royal Society Island, named after the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. It is {{convert|6|km}} long and has a maximum width of {{convert|2.5|km}}.<ref name=Hook/>

The island's northernmost point is Mys Grili (Greely Cape) and the southeastern is Mys Oppoltsera (Cape Oppholtzer).

[[Alger Island, Russia|Alger Island]] and the smaller Mathilda Island lies off MacKlintok Island's northern shore, separated from Alger by a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} narrow sound. Its highest point is near the centre at {{convert|429|m}}. Brady Island off the west coast is a relatively large island and is mostly glaciated. It is located west of MacKlintok Island's northwestern tip, separated from it by the {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Aberdare Sound]] (Proliv Abyerder). The highest point on Brady Island is {{convert|381|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}; it was named after the English scientist [[George Brady (geologist)|George Brady]]. Mys Vize, Brady Island's northernmost cape, is named after Russian Arctic expert [[Vladimir Wiese]]. There are also several islands off the southern shore including the Ostrova Borisika islets and [[Aagaard Island]], {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the southern coast, named in honor of [[Bjarne Aagaard]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]] expert on Antarctic whaling and exploration.<ref name=Franz/>

The island is named after the Arctic explorer, [[Isaac Hayes]].{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=208}}

;Alger Island
Alger Island, (Russian: Ostrov Altzer), is a small island at latitude 80<U+00BA> 23' N and longitude 56.00<U+00BA> E. It divides the south central islands and the north central group, and is located to the south of [[Markham Strait]]. [[McClintock Island]] lies to its south. Discovered in August 1899 by the Waltter Welmann expedition, it was named after [[Russell A. Alger]], [[US Secretary of War]]. The coast line is fairly ice free. In 1901, Evilyn Baldwin established a camp here and named it [[Camp Zeigler]], after [[William Ziegler]] who had sponsored the expedition.{{sfn|Mills|2003|p=10}}

Cape Kohlsaat marks the northwestern-most corner of the [[Kara Sea]], therefore it is a significant geographical landmark. Cape Leiter lies on the south point of the island. This island was named after inventor [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Graham Bell Island should not be confused with the smaller Bell Island which is also part of the Franz Josef Archipelago and which was also named after the same person.

==Timeline==
The time line of events related to the Franz Josef Land from the time of its discovery are given below. {{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|pp=196-203}}

* 1872-74: Discovery by Anglo-Hungarian team of Julius Payer and Carl Weyprecht aboard Admiral Tegetthoff. It was named the newly emerged island as Kaiser Franz Joseph Land. Stranded due to ice at Rudolph island and they made a misjudgment of the stretching ice as leading to the North Pole. Due to bad weather ship was abandoned and the team was rescued at Novalya Zemlya by Russian ships.
* 1879: De Bruyne expedition, retarceted due to thick drifting ice 
* 1880 and 1881-82: Benjamin Leigh Smith explored many islands between Wilzeck and Alexander Island and also established a permanent camp, Eira Lodge or Eira Cottage, on the Bell Island which is still in good shape. Drift ice forced their stay here and their vessel Eira was crushed by ice. They survived by hunting walruses and polar bears.  They were rescued by many western expedition ships that were docked at Novalya Zemlya.
* 1894-97: Expedition teams of Briton Fredrick Jackson (sponsored by newspaper magnate Harmsworth) in 1894, established Elmwood winter base camp on [[Cape Flora]]. They carried out scientific explorations and on 17 June 1896 were also rescuers of two members of an earlier expedition; one of them was Nansen, a [[Norway|Norwegian]], a member of [[Fram Expedition]] (ironically the person who had refused to take Johnson on this expedition. Nansen and his Norwegian colleague, during the period of their obscurity and wanderings in the Franz Josef Land discovered the Eva-Liv Island. 
*1899-1900: Duke of Abruzi and 1901 Stroken on the expedition vessel Stella Polare reached Teplitz Bay on Rudolph Island where the vessel froze due to ice and was damaged. Following the winter season, a 12 member team moved north for 104 days covering  {{Convet|1200|km}}. But disaster struck and three members of the team, Ollier, Querini, and  Stokken,  were never found. Attempt made by Captain Stokken in 1901 to search for his lost son was not fruitful and eventually a memorial column was erected in honour of the three missing members of the expedition.
*1901: Admiral Makarov<U+2019>s team landed here in 1901. It was more of a  hydrographic survey expedition to verify the suitability of the Yermak, the ice breaker ship, said to be <U+201C>worlds<U+2019> first true ice breaker<U+201D>.
* 1901-02: Baldwin-Zeigler team was sponsored by Zeigler with huge contingent of 42 members, 15 ponies, and 400 dos aboard the "America". It had electrical and telephone connectivity but on arriving at the shore the ship froze. The intention was to reach North Pole. Porter, a painter, had also joined the team. They carried out meteorological measurements, operated from the Nansen<U+2019>s cabin on Jackson Island. Thhe expediton was not successful as they did not achieve much and the reason is attributed to the lack of leadership qualities of Baldwin
* 1903-05: Anthony Fiala-Zeigler team, a second effort by Zeigler. Though reached Rudoph Island, their ship America was crushed due to ice during the winter. They had a lot of problems maintaining the supply line and an additional camp was established on [[Alger Island, Russia|Alger Island]] for better communication but the end result was not fruitful as the team returned from the north of the archipelago to the south without exploring the North Pole.
*1886-1930: Norwegian hunters made 116 visits to the Franz Josef Land, concurrent with other expeditions, as hunting trips, and some with smaller vessels, for hunting polar bears and walrus and to exploit its natural resources and to strengthen their claims to this land.
*1912-15: Early Russian expeditions. Georgy Sedov<U+2019>s expedition lasted from 1912-14 but ended in his death on Rudolph Island due to exhaustion without achieving the primary aim of reaching the Pole. The only positive outcome was his establishment of a station at Calm Bay (calm and undisturbed ice) which the Russians adopted it as their permanent station. Their ship St. Foka made it to Cape Flora after lot of hardship. At Cape Flora they met the two surviving members of another expedition of 1912 which was to explore the northern passage with the scope of hunting; there was no trace of the 9 other members of that expedition who had left the ship and also of the remaining members on the ship. One of the survivors later published a book titled <U+201C>In the Land of White Death,<U+201D>  a chronicle of the travails of their expedition. Another expedition under Rusanov with the Hercules vessel had disappeared. Thus, the three expeditions mounted by them had ended in disaster.  Later, the Russians staked their claim to Cape Flora by hoisting their flag there. During WWI and till 1923 Russians did not make any efforts  to restart their expeditions.
* 1926 and 1928: Russians and Italians staked their claims. The territory which was treated a "no man<U+2019>s land" till 1920 went under the control of the Norwegians in 1925 in view of an earlier Spisbergen Treaty negotiations of 1920, even though the Russians had their strong economic and territorial interests. Needled by this development, the Russians unilaterally extended their territorial jurisdiction under a Decree of 15 April 1926 up to and including the North Pole. But the official maps issued by Russia did not reflect this situation in 1926 and 1928 and Franz Joseph land was shown outside their territory in the maps. However, the Russians established their claim by setting up permanent stations in Franz Joesph land and also on Novaya Zemlya. Norwegians sent a protest note to Russia and at the same time the Italians also staked their claim stating that the engine used in the first expedition ship Tegetthoff was made in Italy (in [[Trieste]]) and many members of the expeditions were Italians.
* 1928: Search for Italia and Amundsen<U+2019>s Latham Plane. Nathallie<U+2019>s airship Italia had crashed which was followed by the crash of Latahn Plane. Search operations were launched for locating the airship by all parties concerned. Since international attention was focused on the archipelago, Russia accelerated their operations in the Franz Josef Land Soviet ice breakers (Krasin and Sedov) were sent to facilitate search operations. Concurrently they also carried out hunting operations established a permanent camp at Prince George Island and took possession of the land under the plea that Russians had postulated the theory in 1870 that this land existed on the basis of drift ice studies in the Barent's sea (though the Germans had made this hypotheses a decade earlier)
*1929: Meteorological Station. While the Norwegians could not establish a meteorological station on the land as icy weather prevented their efforts to do so, the Russians with their Ice breaker vessels were able to establish the station at Tikhaya Bay on the Hooker Island. This station operated till 1963.
*1930: Isolation of the Archipelago. A patrolling station established by Russia did not permit Norwegian hunters to operate on the land and they were also forced to give a written agreement not to do any hunting in the future. This was the last effort by Norwegians and they made no more claims on the Franz Josef Land of Russia. When the Norwegians tried to establish their claims indirectly through sending scientists as part of other expeditions and to build stations on Victoria Island and Prince George Island, it was their last such attempt, as Russians closed doors for all expeditions to the land from other nations till 1990. However, they launched their own scientific expeditions to the Victoria Island in 1932
* 1931-41: Soviet  build-up, Arctic Aviation. Aerial survey of the Archipelago was first initiated by Nansen by establishing the International Aero-arctic Association and launching of the first airship LZ 127 Graff Zeppelin. The expedition launched with this ship included Russians and they covered not only the European Arctic but also landed at Tikhaya Bay and carried out aerial survey of substantial part of the Franz Josef Land. This activity was picked up by the Russians on their own. In 1932, during the Second Geophysical Year, the Tikhaya station was expanded and between 1934-37 it became a permanent station of the Soviet Union. A sea plane was also stationed here. In 1937, a temporary airfield was built at Rudolph Island and heavy ANT-Transporters started operating to the North Pole and a first drifting station was also established. 
* 1941-45 [[WWII]] in the Arctic. During the WWII, Germans attacked the archipelago and even established their camp close to Tikhaya station. Soviets evacuated their people except for seven people at their Tikhaya weather station, but the German camp could not detect their presence.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=203}} 
* Post War, Cold War period: The Franz Josef Land became the hub of activity for the Russians when their built bases for bombers and [[nuclear bomb]]. In 1952, Alexander Island became the center of  their large military base which is still a forbidden zone even after its importance reduced following the launch of [[Inter-Continental Missiles]], in 1956. Research activity continued (particularly glaciology) and during the International Geographical and Geophysical Years 1957-59, Heiss (Kheysa) Island became a new permanent base of operation which functioned till 2000. A French group studied the [[ionosphere]] in 1967 and after this the land was totally off limits for all activity to the Westerners, till 1990. As of 2000, the Russians had five stations operating in the Franz Josef Land.{{Sfn|Umbreit|2013|p=203}}
