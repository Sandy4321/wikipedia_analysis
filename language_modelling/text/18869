'''''Neoscona domiciliorum''''', commonly known as the '''spotted orbweaver''' or '''redfemured spotted orbweaver''', is a [[spider]] in the family [[Araneidae]]. The [[specific epithet]] ''domiciliorum'' means "of dwellings" in [[Latin]] and refers to the fact that this species is often found living on buildings.<ref name=BG>[http://bugguide.net/node/view/2034 BugGuide]</ref> It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[United States]] southeast of a line joining Texas, Indiana and Massachusetts.<ref name=FC>[http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/spiders/neoscona.htm Featured Creatures]</ref>

==Description==
The female spotted orbweaver is seven to sixteen millimetres long and is sparsely covered in short gray hairs. The grayish [[Opisthosoma|abdomen]] has lateral broad, black stripes on either side with a thin transverse white band near the front making a pale [[cruciform]] shape. The first segment of each leg is red while the remaining segments are banded in black and pale gray. The underside is dark with four white spots on the abdomen which is red at the tip.<ref>[http://www.floridanature.org/species.asp?species=Neoscona_domiciliorum Florida Nature: Redfemured Spotted Orbweaver]</ref> The male is about eight millimetres long and has a relatively small, linear abdomen.<ref>Berman JD, Levi HW. 1971. The orb weaver genus ''Neoscona'' in North America (Araneae: Araneidae). Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology 141: 465-500.</ref> As in other species in the genus ''[[Neoscona]]'', there is a characteristic longitudinal groove on the [[carapace]] which separates them from species in ''[[Araneus]]''.<ref>[http://www.uark.edu/ua/arthmuse/cavatic.html University of Arkansas Arthropod Museum]</ref>

==Distribution==
This species is endemic to southeastern parts of the United States and has been recorded in Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.<ref>[http://kaston.transy.edu/spiderlist/aranlist.htm Spiders of North America]</ref>

==Biology==
This species is generally found in woodland [[habitat]]s, particularly moist woods dominated by [[hardwood]] trees. It is also found on buildings, especially under the eaves where it may go unnoticed because of its [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] habits. The [[Spider web|web]] is built by the female spotted orbweaver and is frequently replaced, being built at dusk and usually taken down before daybreak.<ref>Kaston BJ. 1976. Supplement to the Spiders of Connecticut. Journal of Arachnology 4: 1-72. </ref> Late in the season the web may be left in place during the day, perhaps because the female has greater nutritional needs at this time when she is preparing for egg laying. The web is placed vertically in trees and shrubs or on a building. In contrast to webs built by species of ''Araneus'', the hub is open and is crossed by only one or two threads. The orb of the web may be fifty centimetres in diameter with long frame lines attached to shrubs or to the ground. A retreat formed of leaves or debris bound together with [[silk]] is built near one end of a frame line.<ref>Carico, J. E. 1986. Web removal patterns in orb-weaving spiders. Pages 306-318 in W. A. Shear (ed.), Spiders: webs, behavior, and evolution. Stanford University Press, Stanford, California. 492 pages.</ref> This is for use during the day as at night the spider normally occupies the hub of the web and is alert to every tremor.<ref name=FC/>
