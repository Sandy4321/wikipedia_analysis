'''Anne Hutchinson''', born '''Anne Marbury''' (1591<U+2013>1643), was a [[Puritan]] woman, spiritual adviser, mother of 15, and important participant in the [[Antinomian Controversy]] that shook the infant [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from 1636 to 1638.  Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the [[Boston]] area, and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened to destroy the Puritans' religious experiment in New England.  She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters.

Born in [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], [[Lincolnshire]], England, Anne was the daughter of [[Francis Marbury]], an Anglican minister and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most girls received.  She lived in London as a young adult, and married there an old friend from home, [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William Hutchinson]], after which the couple moved back to Alford where they began following the dynamic preacher named [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] in the nearby town of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].  After Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 living children, and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in [[New England]].  Anne was a [[midwife]], and very helpful to those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings.  Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony, [[Henry Vane the younger|Henry Vane]].  As a follower of Cotton, she espoused a "covenant of grace," while accusing all of the local ministers (except for Cotton and her husband's brother-in-law, [[John Wheelwright]]) of preaching a "covenant of works."  Following complaints of many ministers about the opinions coming from Hutchinson and her allies, the situation erupted into what is commonly called the Antinomian Controversy, resulting in her 1637 trial, conviction, and banishment from the colony, followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was excommunicated.

With encouragement from [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] founder, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] in what became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].  After her husband's death a few years later, threats of Massachusetts taking over Rhode Island compelled her to move totally outside the reach of Boston, into the lands of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  She settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark called [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]] in what later became [[ The Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. Tensions with the native [[Siwanoy]] were high at the time and, in August 1643, Hutchinson and all but one of the 16 members of her household were massacred during an attack, the only survivor being her nine-year old daughter, [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]], who was taken captive.

Hutchinson is a key figure in the study of the development of religious freedom in England's [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] and the history of women in ministry.  She challenged the authority of the ministers, exposing the subordination of women in the culture of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|colonial Massachusetts]]. She is honoured by Massachusetts with a State House monument calling her a "courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration."  Her well-publicised trials and the accusations against her make her the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history.

[[File:The first Marshalsea prison in the 18th century.JPG|thumb|<center>[[Marshalsea Prison]], London, where Hutchinson's father was detained for two years for "heresy"|alt=A three-story building with three men standing in front having a conversation, and one or more other people near the building.]]

Anne Hutchinson was born Anne Marbury in [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], Lincolnshire, England, and baptised there on 20 July 1591, the daughter of [[Francis Marbury]] and Bridget Dryden.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=479}}{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}}  Her father was an [[Anglican]] minister in [[London]], with strong [[Puritan]] leanings, who felt strongly that the clergy should be well educated, and he clashed with his superiors on this issue.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}} Marbury's repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born; in 1578 he was given a public trial, of which, during a period of house arrest, he made a transcript from memory.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=19}} He later used this transcript to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero, and the Bishop of London being portrayed as a buffoon.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=19}} For his conviction of heresy, Marbury spent two years in [[Marshalsea]] Prison, on the south side of the River [[Thames]], across from London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=26}} In 1580, at the age of 25, he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach, and moved to the remote market town of Alford in Lincolnshire, about {{convert|140|mi}} north of London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=27}}

Anne's father was soon appointed curate (deputy vicar) of [[St. Wilfrid's Church, Alford|Saint Wilfrid's]], the local church in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford [[Free Grammar School]], one of many such public schools, free to the poor, begun by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=29<U+2013>30}} About this time Marbury married his first wife, Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=31}} Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he, from a prominent [[Northampton]] family.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=31}}  Dryden's brother, Erasmus, was the grandfather of the famous playwright and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[John Dryden]].{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=9}}  Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood.{{sfn|Colket|1936|pp=33<U+2013>34}} The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15&nbsp;years of Anne's life, and with her father's strong commitment to learning, she received a better education than most contemporary girls, and also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=1}} While education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men, one reason that Marbury may have focused on teaching his daughters is that his five oldest surviving children were all girls; another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=31<U+2013>32}}

In 1605, when Anne was 14, the family moved from Alford to the heart of London where her father was given the position of vicar of the Church of [[St Martin Vintry|Saint Martin's in the Vintry]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=34}} Here his puritan views, though somewhat muffled, were nevertheless present and tolerated, because of a shortage of pastors.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=34}}{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}}   Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of [[St Pancras, Soper Lane|Saint Pancras]], several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}} In 1610 he was able to replace that position with one much closer to home, and became rector of [[St Margaret, New Fish Street|Saint Margaret's]], on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}} He was at a high point in his career, but in February 1611, when Anne was 19&nbsp;years old, he died suddenly at the age of 55.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=37}}

=== Adulthood<U+2014>following John Cotton ===

The year after her father's death, Anne Marbury, aged 21, married an old acquaintance from Alford, [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William Hutchinson]], who was a fabric merchant working at the time in London.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}  The couple was married at [[St Mary Woolnoth]] Church in London on 9 August 1612, shortly after which they moved back to their hometown of Alford.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=479}}{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}  It was not long before they heard about a dynamic and captivating minister, [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]], who preached at [[St Botolph's Church, Boston|Saint Botolph's Church]] in the large market town of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], about {{convert|21|mi}} from Alford.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004 |p=85}}  The year the Hutchinsons were married, Cotton left [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] in [[Cambridge]] where he had been a tutor, to become the minister at Boston.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Though only 27&nbsp;years old, his vigorous and incessant preaching established him as one of the leading Puritans in England.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible, enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=85}}  Cotton represented the more mystical element in the Puritan movement, putting less emphasis on man's struggle to prepare himself for God's salvation, and more emphasis on the transforming character of the moment of religious conversion "in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace."{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}}  Cotton downplayed the role of works in man's relationship with God, as he became one of the most distinguished Puritan clergymen.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}}  Anne Hutchinson was particularly drawn to Cotton's theology of "absolute grace", and this pointed her life in the direction of study and interpretation of God's word.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=86}}  It may be from Cotton that Hutchinson learned to question the significance of the "law" and "works," and he may also have encouraged her to view the Holy Spirit as "indwelling" in the "elect saint."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=x}}  Embracing Cotton's doctrine of the Holy Ghost dwelling within a "justified person," Hutchinson took the notion further, seeing herself as a "mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=86}}  It was a theology that could empower women in a society where a woman's status was determined by their husbands or fathers; in the case of Hutchinson, it gave her a voice.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=87}}

[[File:JohnCotton.jpg|left|thumb|<center>Reverend [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] was Hutchinson's mentor, and her reason for immigrating to New England.|alt=A painting of a man with long curly hair and a slight smile, wearing the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

Another strong influence on Hutchinson was closer to her home, in the town of [[Bilsby]], where her husband's brother-in-law, the young minister [[John Wheelwright]], preached a spiritual message similar to Cotton's.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2}}  Only attending services, led by reformers such as Cotton and Wheelwright, was insufficient for many Puritan worshippers who sought avenues for expressing their sense of religious rebirth, leading to the rise of [[conventicle]]s, gatherings of "those who had found grace" to listen to sermon repetitions, discuss and debate scripture, and pray.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  Such assemblies were frowned upon by the established Anglican church hierarchy, and even ignored by some of the Puritan clergy.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=2<U+2013>3}}  There is some evidence that women played an active role in these gatherings, being able to speak out and exert religious leadership otherwise denied them within the church hierarchy.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  One such person was "the woman of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]]," whose activities were known to Anne Hutchinson.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  Inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles, Hutchinson began holding meetings in her own house, repeating and offering explanation of sermons.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=87}}

The Puritans wanted to abolish the pomp and ceremony of the Church of England and base their church governance on a simple, consensual pattern.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=7}}  They wished to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, choose their own elders (or governors), and provide for a lay leader and two ministers<U+2014>one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people's souls.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=7}}  By 1633, Cotton's inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop [[William Laud]] who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the tenets of the established [[Anglican Church]].{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  In that year, Cotton was removed from his ministry, and forced into hiding.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  Threatened with imprisonment, he made a hasty departure for [[New England]] aboard the ship ''Griffin'', taking his pregnant wife who was so close to term that she bore her child aboard the ship (they named the child Seaborn).{{sfn|Champlin|1913|pp=3<U+2013>4}}  When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson described it as a "great trouble unto her," and said that she "could not be at rest" until she followed her minister to New England.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Mrs. Hutchinson now believed that the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] instructed her to follow Cotton to America, impressed by the evidence of divine providence.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}}  Detaining her, however, was the fact that she was well into a pregnancy that would result in her 14th child, and she would not travel until after the baby was born.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=3}}  With the intention of soon coming to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son, [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]], to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=4}}  Then, in 1634, 43-year old Anne Hutchinson, her 48-year old husband William, and their other ten living children, aged about eight months to 19&nbsp;years, set sail from England aboard the ''Griffin'', the same ship that carried Cotton and their oldest son to New England a year earlier.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=4}}

== Boston ==

Will Hutchinson had been very successful in his mercantile business back in Alford, and brought a considerable estate with him to New England.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=156}}  The Hutchinson family arrived in Boston in the late summer of 1634, and purchased a half acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula, now downtown Boston.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=154}}  Here they had a house built, one of the largest on the peninsula, with a timber frame, a central chimney, glass windows, and at least two stories.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=154}}  The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the great fire of Boston, after which the [[Old Corner Bookstore]] was built on the exact location.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=257}} They soon acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston, {{convert|10|mi}} south of Boston in the area that later became [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and also were granted Taylor's Island in the Boston harbour, where the Hutchinsons grazed their sheep.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=155<U+2013>156}}  Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade, made land purchases and investments, and became a town [[selectman]] and deputy to the General Court.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=3}} Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, and devoted many hours to those who were ill or in need.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  She became an active [[midwife]] and took on the role of spiritual adviser to other women.  Magistrate [[John Winthrop]] noted that "her ordinary talke was about the things of the Kingdome of God," and "her usuall conversation was in the way of righteousness and kindnesse."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=33}} Hutchinson particularly tended to those women in childbirth, which was a "grave, protracted, and heavily attended event" among women; as many as 20 percent of women died from it.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=33}}

=== Boston Church ===

The Hutchinsons became members of the [[First Church of Boston|Boston Church]], the most important church in the colony.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  With its location and harbour, Boston was a hub of commerce and communication in New England, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as "the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton's first four months there.  In his journal, Winthrop proclaimed, "more were converted & added to that Churche, than to all the other Churches in the Baye", and historian Michael Winship notes that the church approached the Puritan ideal of a Christian community.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=35}}  Early Massachusetts historian [[William Hubbard (clergyman)|William Hubbard]] found the church to be "in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where else to be paralleled."  It was an exceptional twist of fate that the most important, most visible church in the colony managed to have the most unconventional of all prominent Puritan ministers in [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]].  The more divergent theological ideas of Hutchinson and the colony's young governor, [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] (who came from England with his own non-orthodox notions), did not stick out much because of Cotton's own divergence from the mainstream Puritan orthodoxy.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=39}}

=== Home Bible study group ===

While working as a midwife, Hutchinson's visits with others led to discussions along the lines of the conventicles in England, and soon she was hosting weekly meetings at her home for women who wanted to discuss Cotton's sermons, and hear her explanations and elaborations.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  Her meetings for women became so popular that soon she had to organise meetings for men as well, and she was hosting 60 or more people per week.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}  Hutchinson's ministerings were effective and brought women, as well as their husbands, "to enquire more seriously after the Lord Jesus Christ."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=34}}  Both men and women came to Hutchinson for counsel, where she offered her advanced spiritual state as a model, with a positive initial result.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=34}}

In time, Hutchinson began to give her own views on religion, espousing that "an intuition of the Spirit," and not good works, was the only valid proof of one's [[Predestination|election]] by God.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}} Often her spiritual interpretation diverged widely from the more refined and legalistic sermons of the colony's ministers.  Hutchinson's following increased, and soon included Governor Vane.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}} Others, particularly merchants and craftsmen, were attracted by her ideas of the disassociation of the state of a man's soul and his outward behaviour.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  Several of the colony's ministers increasingly opposed Hutchinson<U+2019>s meetings, on the ostensible grounds that such <U+201C>unauthorised<U+201D> religious gatherings might confuse the faithful, but she countered with a verse from Titus stating that <U+201C>the elder women should instruct the younger."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=39}}

=== Antinomian controversy ===

{{main|Antinomian Controversy}}

Besides Hutchinson's gatherings being seen as unorthodox by some of the colony's ministers, differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates.  The resulting religious tension erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy, but has more recently been labelled the Free Grace Controversy.

[[File:Wheelwright.John.AmAntiquarianSoc.jpg|thumb |right |<center>Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] was an ally of Hutchinson during the Antinomian Controversy, and both were banished.|alt=A painting of a man with a white moustache and small beard.  He is wearing a skull cap and the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

In September 1634, the Reverend Zachariah Symmes, who sailed to New England on the same ship as the Hutchinsons, told another minister that he doubted Anne Hutchinson's orthodoxy based on questions that she asked him following his ship-board sermons.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}  This issue delayed Hutchinson's membership to the Boston church by a week, until a pastoral examination determined that she was sufficiently orthodox to join the church.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=41}}  Later, a difficult situation occurred when in 1635 the senior pastor of the Boston church, [[John Wilson (Puritan)|John Wilson]], returned from a trip to England where he had been settling his affairs.  Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his.{{sfn|Battis|1962 |p=105}}  She found his emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of "evidencing justification by sanctification" (a [[Covenant theology#Covenant of works|covenant of works]]) to be disagreeable, and she told her followers that Wilson lacked "the seal of the Spirit."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=105}}  Wilson's doctrines were shared by all of the other ministers in the colony, except Cotton. The Boston congregation had grown accustomed to Cotton's lack of emphasis on preparation (works) "in favor of stressing the inevitability of God's will" (free grace).{{sfn|Bremer|1995|p=66}}  Hutchinson and her allies began disrupting Wilson's sermons, generated divisive debates in the Boston church, and even found excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}}

As early as the spring of 1636, the minister of Newtown (which later became [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]), [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]], began writing letters to the other Boston minister, John Cotton.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=64<U+2013>69}}  In these letters, he expressed concern about Cotton's preaching, and about some of the unorthodox opinions circulating among his Boston parishioners.  Shepard's "heresy hunting" went even further when he began criticising this unorthodoxy to his Newtown congregation during his sermons.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=64<U+2013>69}}  In May 1636 the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] arrived from England, and immediately aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson and other free grace advocates.  Wheelwright had not only been a close neighbour of the Hutchinsons in Lincolnshire, but his wife was [[Edward Hutchinson (mercer)#Mary Hutchinson|a sister]] of Hutchinson's husband.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=44<U+2013>45}}  Another boost for the free grace advocates came during the same month when the young aristocrat [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] was elected as the governor of the colony.  Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but also had his own ideas about theology that were considered not only unorthodox, but radical by some.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=6<U+2013>7}}

Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continued to question the orthodox ministers in the colony.  Wheelwright began preaching at [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Mount Wollaston]], about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse, and his sermons began to answer Shepard's criticisms with their own criticism of the covenant of works preached by Shepard.  This mounting "pulpit aggression" along with the disrespect shown Boston's Reverend Wilson continued throughout the summer.  Wilson endured these religious differences for several months before deciding that the affronts and errors were serious enough to require a response.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=39}}  He is the one who likely alerted his parishioner, magistrate John Winthrop, to take notice, and on or shortly after 21 October 1636 Winthrop gave the first public warning of this problem that would consume him and the leadership of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for much of the next two years.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=481<U+2013>482}}  Instead of pinning blame on one of the godly ministers, in his journal he wrote, "One Mrs. Hutchinson, a member of the church at Boston, a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit, brought over with her two dangerous errors: 1.&nbsp;That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person. 2.&nbsp;That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification."{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}  He then went on to elaborate these two points, and with this journal entry, the Antinomian Controversy began.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}

On 25 October 1636 seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord, and held a "private conference" which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=86}}  In this meeting, some agreement was reached, and Cotton "gave satisfaction to them [the other ministers], so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=6}}  Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had, during her conventicles, accused them of preaching a covenant of works and that they were not able ministers of the [[New Testament]].  Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time, and with the expectation that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=86<U+2013>89}}  A year later her words would be used against her in a trial that would result in her banishment from the colony.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=90}}

[[File:Henry Vane the Younger by Sir Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|right|Governor [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] strongly supported Hutchinson during the colony's difficulties.|alt=A painting of a man with a virile face and long dark hair; he is wearing a dark red robe-like outfit, and his demeanour conveys elegance and importance.]]

By late 1636, as the controversy deepened, Hutchinson and her supporters were accused of two heresies in the Puritan church: [[antinomianism]] and [[familism]]. The word "antinomianism" literally means "against or opposed to the law"; in a theological context it means "the moral law is not binding upon Christians, who are under the law of grace."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=3}} Technically, if one was under the law of grace then moral law did not apply, raising the spectre of a range of deviant behaviour in the eyes of the church and society.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}} [[Familism]], named for a 16th century sect called the Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it.{{Sfn|Winship|2002|p=22}}  Hutchinson and her supporters were inappropriately accused of engaging in "free love", a label that was actually antithetical to their beliefs.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}  The colonists who embraced the law of grace did not call themselves Antinomians, since to them the term implied licentious behaviour and religious heterodoxy; the term was used instead by their opponents, to discredit them.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=3}} The controversy became a struggle for control of Massachusetts; it came at a time when the new society was forming, and it had a decisive effect upon the future of New England.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=3}} While Hutchinson, Wheelwright and Vane all took leading roles as antagonists of the orthodox party, theologically it was Cotton's differences of opinion with the other ministers in Massachusetts that was at the heart of the controversy.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=4}}

By winter the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties. During the appointed fast-day on Thursday, 19 January 1637, Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon, and while in the eyes of a lay person his sermon may have appeared benign and non-threatening, to the Puritan clergy it was "censurable and incited mischief."{{Sfn|Bell|1876|p=11}}  The colony's ministers were offended by the production, but the free grace advocates were encouraged, and intensified their crusade against the "legalists" among the clergy.  During church services and lectures they publicly asked the ministers about their doctrines which disagreed with their own beliefs,{{Sfn|Hall|1990|p=7}} and Henry Vane in particular became active in challenging the doctrines of the colony's divines.{{Sfn|Winship|2002|p=116}}  Furthering the difficulties, supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the [[Pequot War]] because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}}  The bold demeanour of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the "Puritan's holy experiment,"{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}} and had they succeeded they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history.{{sfn|Dunn|1981|p=143}}

==== Events of 1637 ====

By March, the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates.  Wheelwright was tried for contempt and sedition that month for his fast-day sermon, and in a close vote he was convicted, but not yet sentenced.  During the election of May 1637, not only was Henry Vane replaced as governor by John Winthrop, but all of the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office.  By the summer of 1637 Vane sailed back to England, never to return, and with this strong ally of the free grace advocates out of the way, the time was ripe for the orthodox party to deal with the remainder of their rivals.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=126-148}}  At the autumn court in 1637, which convened on 2 November, Wheelwright was sentenced to banishment, and ordered to leave the colony within 14 days.  Then, several of the other supporters of Hutchinson and Wheelwright were given varied sentences.  Following these preliminaries, it was Anne Hutchinson's turn to be tried.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=167-168}}

==== Civil trial ====

With Wheelwright banished and other court business taken care of, on 7 November 1637 Hutchinson was brought to trial, presided over by Governor John Winthrop, on the charge of <U+201C>traducing [slandering] the ministers<U+201D>.  Other charges against her were laid out by Winthrop including being one who "troubled the peace of the commonwealth and churches", promoting and divulging opinions that had caused recent troubles, and continuing to hold meetings at her home despite a recent [[Antinomian Controversy#The synod of 1637|synod]] that had condemned them.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=170}}  It was difficult to pin accusations on her, because unlike Wheelwright and the other men tried before her, she had never spoken anything publicly, nor had she ever signed anything.  Winthrop's first two lines of prosecutorial attack were to paint her as a co-conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony, and then fault her for holding her conventicles.  Hutchinson, question by question, effectively stonewalled him, pushing him into an uncomfortable corner.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=170<U+2013>171}}  The floundering Winthrop was unable to find a way to convert Hutchinson's known membership in a seditious faction into a convictable offence.  This is when the deputy governor, [[Thomas Dudley]], stepped in with his solid legal background.  Dudley essentially harangued Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators, and then, unanswered by Hutchinson, moved on to the charge of slandering the ministers.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}

[[File:JohnWinthropColorPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|<center>[[John Winthrop]] presided over Hutchinson's trial in 1637 as both accuser and judge.|alt=A painting of a man with a stern expression on his face, wearing very dark clothing so that his pale hands show boldly.  His hands are placed in front of him, separately, one above the other.]]

The remainder of the trial was spent on this last charge.  The goal of the prosecution was to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony's ministers, and to use the October meeting as their evidence.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  Six ministers had presented their written versions of the October conference to the court, and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements.  However, her defence was that she had spoken only reluctantly and in private, and that in the ministerial context of the meeting she said she "must either speak false or true in my answers".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  In those private meetings she had even gone as far as citing Proverbs 29:25, "The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=172}}  The court, however, was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=173}}

At the end of the first day of the trial, as the hour grew late, Winthrop recorded, "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to acknowledge the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=60}} The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had outfenced the magistrates in a battle of wits.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=60}} Biographer Eve LaPlante noted, "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her.  She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God..."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=68}}

During the morning of the second day of the trial it appeared that Hutchinson had been given some legal counsel the previous evening, and she now had a lot to say.  She continued to accuse the ministers of violating their mandate of confidentiality, and she accused them of deceiving the court about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them.  She now insisted that the ministers testify under oath, which they were very hesitant to do.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=173}}  Magistrate [[Simon Bradstreet]] said that "she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath", but she answered that if they were going to accuse her that "I desire it may be upon oath."{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=173<U+2013>174}}  As a matter of due process, the ministers would have to be sworn in, but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first.  There were three such witnesses, all from the Boston church: deacon [[John Coggeshall]], lay leader Thomas Leverett, and minister John Cotton.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=175}}  The first two witnesses made brief statements that had little effect on the court, but Cotton was grilled extensively.  When Cotton testified, he tended to not remember many events of the October meeting, and attempted to soften the meaning of statements that Hutchinson was being accused of.  He further stressed that the ministers were not as upset about any Hutchinson remarks at the end of the October meeting as they appeared to be later.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=176}}  When Dudley reiterated that Hutchinson had told the ministers that they were not able ministers of the New Testament, Cotton replied that he did not remember her saying that.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=176}}

There was more parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not picked up in the transcript of the proceedings.  Wherever the proceedings were headed, Hutchinson took the load off the consciences of her accusers, and asked the court for leave to "give you the ground of what I know to be true."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=62}} She then addressed the court with her own judgment:
<!--

-->
{{quotation|You have no power over my body, neither can you do me any harm<U+2014>for I am in the hands of the eternal Jehovah, my Saviour, I am at his appointment, the bounds of my habitation are cast in heaven, no further do I esteem of any mortal man than creatures in his hand, I fear none but the great Jehovah, which hath foretold me of these things, and I do verily believe that he will deliver me out of our hands. Therefore take heed how you proceed against me<U+2014>for I know that, for this you go about to do to me, God will ruin you and your posterity and this whole state.{{sfn|Adams|1894|p=175}}|Anne Hutchinson at trial}}

This was the "dramatic high point of the most analyzed event of the free grace controversy", wrote historian Michael Winship.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=175}}  Historians have given a variety of reasons for this seemingly impulsive statement, including an "exultant impulse", "hysteria", "cracking under the strain of the inquest", and being "possessed of the Spirit".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=177}}  Winship, citing the work of Mary Beth Norton, suggested instead that this was a planned and conscious decision on the part of Hutchinson to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament.  This was "not histrionics, but pedagogy"; it was Hutchinson's attempt to teach the Court, which was consistent with her character.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=177}}

Hutchinson had just greatly simplified the task of her opponents whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=178}}  Her revelation was not only seditious, but also in contempt of court.  Cotton, pressed by Dudley on whether or not he supported Hutchinson's revelation, said he could find theological justification for it.  Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=180}}  Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling, though; he instead was using Hutchinson's bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history.  Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the monocausal culprit.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=181<U+2013>182}}  Winthrop then addressed the court, "if therefore it be the mind of the court, looking at [her] as the principal cause of all our trouble, that they would now consider what is to be done with her."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=182}}

The Bostonians made a final effort to slow the proceedings. [[William Coddington]] rose, asserting, "I do not see any clear witness against her, and you know it is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too..." then ended with "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke, and therefore deserve no censure."{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=63}}  Unfazed, the court wanted a sentence, but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke.  Three of the ministers were then sworn in, and testified against Hutchinson.  Winthrop then moved to have her banished, and in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=182<U+2013>183}}  Hutchinson then challenged the sentence's legitimacy, stating, "I desire to know wherefore I am banished", to which Winthrop responded, somewhat arrogantly, "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied."{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=183}}

Hutchinson was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil, and was condemned to banishment by the Court "as being a woman not fit for our society".{{sfn|Crawford|1970|pp=144<U+2013>146}}  The Puritans sincerely believed that in banishing Hutchinson they were protecting God's eternal truth.{{sfn|Morgan|1981|p=57}}  Winthrop summed up the case with genuine feeling: "Thus it pleased the Lord to heare the prayers of his afflicted people&nbsp;... and by the care and indevour of the wise and faithfull ministers of the Churches, assisted by the Civill authority, to discover this Master-piece of the old Serpent..." and he ended by noting, "It is the Lords work, and it is marvellous in our eyes."{{sfn|Morgan|1981|p=57}}

==== Detention ====

Following her civil trial, Hutchinson was put under house arrest and ordered to be gone by the end of the following March.  In the interim, she was not allowed to return home, but instead was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Thomas Weld]], located in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], about two miles from her home in Boston.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=158}} While the distance was not great, Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather, which was particularly harsh that winter.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}} Winthrop, who referred to Hutchinson as "the prisoner", was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}} She was frequently visited by the various preachers, whose intent was to reform her thinking, but also to collect evidence against her.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=159}}  [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard]], who was there to "collect errors", concluded that she was a dangerous woman.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=122}}  Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drew up a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church, which then decided that she should stand trial for these views.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=197}}

==== Church trial ====

Following a four-month detention, Hutchinson, weary and in poor health, was called to trial on Thursday, 15 March 1638.  The trial took place at her home church in Boston, though many of her supporters were gone.  Her husband and other friends had already left the colony to prepare for a new place to live.  Her only family members present were her oldest son [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]] and his wife, her daughter Faith and son-in-law [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]], and her sister Katharine with her husband [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard Scott]].{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=235}}

[[File:JohnWilson 1stChurch Boston.png|thumb|left|<center>[[John Wilson (Puritan)|Reverend John Wilson]], who had been ridiculed by Hutchinson, made the final pronouncement of excommunication during her church trial.|alt=Sketch of a man with long flowing hair who is wearing the bib of a colonial-era minister.]]

The ministers were determined to protect their doctrine, and felt a mounting indignation toward Hutchinson.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=235}}  The ruling elder, Thomas Leverett, was charged with managing the examination. He  called Mrs. Hutchinson forth and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged.  What followed was a nine-hour interrogation, delving into the murky points of theology.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=236}}  At the end of the gruelling session, where only four of the many errors were covered, Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer.  He spoke, "I would speake it to Gods Glory [that] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us...he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}}  With this said, it was the overwhelming conclusion of the ministers that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}}  Cotton continued, "You cannot Evade the Argument&nbsp;... that filthie Sinne of the Communitie of Woemen; and all promiscuous and filthie cominge togeather of men and Woemen without Distinction or Relation of Mariage, will necessarily follow...Though I have not herd, nayther do I thinke you have bine unfaythfull to your Husband in his Marriage Covenant, yet that will follow upon it."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=242}}  Here Cotton was making a link between her theological ideas and the more extreme behaviour credited to the antinomians and familists.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=202}}  He then concluded, "Therefor, I doe Admonish you, and alsoe charge you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus], in whose place I stand...that you would sadly consider the just hand of God agaynst you, the great hurt you have done to the Churches, the great Dishonour you have brought to Je[sus] Ch[rist], and the Evell that you have done to many a poore soule."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=243}}  With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return on the next lecture day, in one week.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=243}}

Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner, and with the permission of the court Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where Reverend [[John Davenport (Puritan)|John Davenport]] was also staying.  All week the two ministers worked with her, and under their supervision she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that brought objection from all the ministers.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=244}}  At the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March, Hutchinson stood, and in a subdued voice read her recantation to the congregation.  Here she admitted that she had been wrong about the soul and spirit, wrong about the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, wrong about her demeanour toward the ministers, and most remarkably agreed that sanctification could evidence justification (a covenant of works) "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=203}}  Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in good standing with the Boston church, even with the possibility of returning there some day.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=204}}

For some of the ministers, though, it was not sufficient for this proud, strong-minded woman to submit to the humiliation of making a public confession.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=244}}  Wilson had to explore an accusation made by Shepard at the end of the previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults.  While the outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day's grilling, her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment.{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=204}}  With this, she was accused of lying, but even at this point Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she "set forth her owne stuffe".{{sfn|Winship|2002|p=206}}  To these sentiments Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a "Notorious Imposter" in whose heart there was never any grace.  He went on to admonish the "heinousness of her lying" during a time of supposed humiliation.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=207<U+2013>208}}  Shepard had swayed the proceedings, and with Cotton signalling that he had given up on her, followed by an appropriate pause, her sentence was presented by Wilson: "Forasmuch as you, Mrs. Hutchinson, have highly transgressed and offended&nbsp;... and troubled the Church with your Errors and have drawen away many a poor soule, and have upheld your Revelations; and forasmuch as you have made a Lye&nbsp;... Therefor in the name of our Lord Je[sus] Ch[rist]...I doe cast you out and&nbsp;... deliver you up to Sathan&nbsp;... and account you from this time forth to be a Hethen and a Publican&nbsp;... I command you in the name of Ch[rist] Je[sus] and of this Church as a Leper to withdraw your selfe out of the Congregation." {{sfn|Battis|1962|pp=246<U+2013>247}}

Hutchinson was now not only banished from the colony, but excommunicated from the church, and her leading supporters, including Coddington and Coggeshall, had been given three months to leave the colony, while others were disenfranchised or dismissed from their churches.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=63}} The court had ordered in November that 58 citizens of Boston and 17 from adjacent towns be disarmed unless they repudiated the "seditious label" given them, and many of these people followed Hutchinson into exile.{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=64}}

== Rhode Island ==

[[File:Portsmouth Compact document.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Portsmouth Compact]]|alt=A document with some hand-written and difficult to read text at the top, followed by 23 signatures, some of which are also difficult to read, with some washed-out text appearing in the margins. The document appears old and fragile.]]

During Hutchinson's imprisonment, several of her supporters prepared to leave the colony and settle elsewhere.  One such group of men, including her husband Will, met on 7 March 1638, at the home of the wealthy Boston merchant William Coddington. Ultimately [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Founders of Portsmouth|23 men signed]] what is known as the [[Portsmouth Compact]], forming themselves into a "Bodie Politick" and electing Coddington as their governor, but giving him the Biblical title of "judge".  Of the signers, 19 of them initially planned to move to New Jersey or Long Island, but [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] convinced them to settle in the area of his [[Providence Plantations]] settlement. Coddington purchased [[Aquidneck Island]] (later named Rhode Island), in the [[Narragansett Bay]], from the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] and the settlement of Pocasset (soon renamed [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]]) was founded.  Anne Hutchinson followed in April, after the conclusion of her church trial.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

Hutchinson, her children, and others accompanying her travelled for more than six days by foot in the April snow to get from Boston to Roger Williams' settlement at Providence.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=208}} They then took boats to get to Aquidneck Island, where many men had gone ahead of them to begin constructing houses.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=212}}  In the second week of April, she reunited with her husband, from whom she had been separated for nearly six months.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=212}}

=== Final pregnancy ===

Following the stress of her trial, her imprisonment all winter, and the difficult trip to Aquidneck Island, Hutchinson went into labour in May 1638, and delivered a strange mass of tissue that was described by Doctor [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]], who had attended to her.{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} The mass looked like a handful of transparent grapes, known now as a [[hydatidiform mole]], and is a relatively rare condition occurring most often in women over 45, resulting from one or two sperm cells fertilising a blighted egg.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=217}}  Hutchinson had been ill most of the winter, with unusual weakness, throbbing headaches and bouts of vomitting.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=217}} While almost all writers on the subject agree that she had been pregnant during her trial, Emery Battis, citing expert opinion, suggested that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time, but instead was displaying acute symptoms of [[menopause]].{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} The following April, however, when she reunited with her husband, she did become pregnant of a "menopausal baby" that aborted as the hydatidiform mole.{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=16}} A woman who, for 25&nbsp;years, underwent a continuous cycle of pregnancies, deliveries, and lactations, with the burdens of raising a large family subjected to the extreme stress of her trials would understandably experience severe menopausal symptoms.{{sfn|Battis|1981|p=17}}

The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's suffering and also that of [[Mary Dyer]], one of her followers who also suffered with the premature and still birth of a severely deformed infant, labelling their misfortunes as the judgement of God.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}  Winthrop wrote, "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look<U+2014>as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=218}}  Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area, and when laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors, she shouted at them "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!"{{sfn|Morris|1981|p=64}}

=== Dissension in government ===

Less than a year after Pocasset was settled, there were rifts and civil difficulties.  Coddington, who had openly supported Hutchinson following her trial, had become autocratic, and began to alienate his fellow settlers.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=222}} Early in 1639 Hutchinson became acquainted with [[Samuel Gorton]], who attacked the legitimacy of the magistrates.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=223}} On 28 April 1639, Gorton and a dozen other men ejected Coddington from power, and while Hutchinson may not have supported this rebellion, her husband was chosen as the new governor. Two days later, [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Residents of Portsmouth after split with Newport|over 30 men]] signed a document forming a new "civil body politic". Winthrop noted in his journal that at Aquidneck "the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates, and chose Mr. William Hutchinson only, a man of very mild temper and weak parts, and wholly guided by his wife, who had been the beginner of all the former troubles in the country and still continued to breed disturbance."{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=482}}

Coddington left the colony along with some of his followers, and established the settlement of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] at the south end of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth and adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}} The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; many, such as Coggeshall, [[Nicholas Easton]], [[William Brenton]], [[Jeremy Clarke (governor)|Jeremy Clarke]], and [[Henry Bull (governor)|Henry Bull]], became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646.{{sfn|Arnold|1859|p=132}} On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

During her tenure in Portsmouth, Hutchinson developed a new philosophy concerning religion.  She persuaded her husband to resign from his position as a magistrate, as Roger Williams put it, "because of the opinion, which she had newly taken up, of the unlawfulness of magistracy." According to historian [[Murray Rothbard]], she had been led by her conscience and by meditation on the Scripture and logic to the conclusion of [[individualist anarchism]].{{sfn|Rothbard|1975|p=22}}

Amid the Hutchinson's new life in Portsmouth, a great loss occurred sometime after June 1641, when Hutchinson's beloved husband, Will, died at the age of 55, the same age at which her father had died.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=228}}{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=479<U+2013>481}} He was buried in Portsmouth, but no record of his death exists, because there was no established church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=228}}

== New Netherland ==

[[File:SplitRock.EastFace.LookingWest.20110820.jpg|thumb|left|<center>[[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], near where the Hutchinson family was massacred|alt=A photograph of a very large rock, about the size of a small truck, that has a large fissure in the middle.  The rock is surrounded by trees and other vegetation.]]

Not long after the settlement of Aquidneck Island, the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats to take over the island and the entire Narragansett Bay area, causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety. This compelled her to move totally out of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]], and [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]] and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Sometime after the summer of 1642, Hutchinson, seven of her children, a son-in-law, and several servants, 16 total persons by several accounts, went to [[New Netherland]].  There they settled near an ancient landmark called [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], not far from what would become the [[Hutchinson River]] in northern [[Bronx]], [[New York City]].{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}}  Other Rhode Island families were in the area, including the Throckmortons and the Cornells.  By one account Hutchinson bought her land from [[John Throckmorton (settler)|John Throckmorton]] (for whom [[Throggs Neck]] is named) who had earlier been a settler of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] with [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], but was now living in New Netherland.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}}

While staying temporarily in an abandoned house, the Hutchinson's permanent house was being built with the help of [[James Sands]], who had married Katherine Walker, a granddaughter of William Hutchinson's brother Edward.{{sfn|Barr|1946|p=7}} Sands later became a settler of [[Block Island]] (later [[Shoreham-by-Sea|New Shoreham]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]), and the Reverend Samuel Niles, another early settler of Block Island, recorded the following about Sands' experience in New Netherland: <blockquote>"Mrs. Hutchinson&nbsp;... removed to Rhode Island, but making no long stay there, she went further westward to a place called Eastchester, now in the eastern part of the province of New York, where she prepared to settle herself; but not to the good liking of the Indians that lived back in the woods, as the sequel proves. In order to pursue her purpose, she agreed with Captain James Sands, then a young man, to build her house, and he took a partner with him in the business&nbsp;... there came a company of Indians to the frame where he was at work, and made a great shout and sat down.  After some time, they gathered up his tools, put his broad axe on his shoulders and his other tools into his hands, and made signs for him to go away. But he seemed to take no notice of them, but continued in his work."{{sfn|Barr|1946|p=8}}</blockquote> Thus the natives gave overt clues that they were displeased with the settlement being formed there. While the property had supposedly been secured by an agent of the Dutch West India Company in 1640, the negotiation was transacted with members of the [[Siwanoy]] people in distant [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], and the local natives likely had little to do with that transaction, if they even knew of it at all.{{sfn|Bolton|1922|p=44}} Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.{{sfn|Bolton|1922|p=44}}

The exact location of the Hutchinson house has been a source of great interest for several centuries.  LaPlante, in her recent biography of Hutchinson, hints that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day [[Pelham Bay Park]], on the east side of the Hutchinson River.  Offering another hypothesis, Lockwood Barr, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929, concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester.{{sfn|Barr|1946|p=5}} A map in Barr's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called Baychester, between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook.{{sfn|Barr|1946|pp=28<U+2013>29, plate VI}}  This area of the Bronx is now highly developed, and while Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts,{{sfn|Corbett}} Black Dog Brook is defunct.{{sfn|New York Parks|2001}}

=== Massacre ===

The Hutchinsons were unfortunate in the timing of their settlement in this area, and soon became victims of the local unrest. The Dutch governor, [[Willem Kieft]], had aroused the ire of the natives with his inhumanity and treachery.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Mrs. Hutchinson, who had a favourable relationship with the [[Narragansett people]] in Rhode Island, likely felt a false sense of safety among the Siwanoy of New Netherland.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} The Hutchinsons had been friendly to them but following their mistreatment by the Dutch, these natives ravaged the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as [[Kieft's War]]. The fate of the Hutchinson family was aptly summarised by LaPlante:

[[File:Hutchinson.massacre.jpg|thumb|<center>Massacre of the Hutchinsons|alt=Sketch of a crouched woman who is sheltering a small child, with four other children nearby. The children are being attacked by seven native Americans wielding tomahawks and knives, near the doorway of a dwelling house. There is a dead or dying young man lying on the ground in the foreground.]]

<blockquote>The Siwanoy warriors stampeded into the tiny settlement above Pelham Bay, prepared to burn down every house. The Siwanoy chief, [[Chief Wampage|Wampage]], who had sent a warning, expected to find no settlers present. But at one house the men in animal skins encountered several children, young men and women, and a woman past middle age. One Siwanoy indicated that the Hutchinsons should restrain the family's dogs. Without apparent fear, one of the family tied up the dogs. As quickly as possible, the Siwanoy seized and scalped Francis Hutchinson, William Collins, several servants, the two Annes (mother and daughter), and the younger children<U+2014>William, Katherine, Mary, and Zuriel. As the story was later recounted in Boston, one of the Hutchinson's daughters, "seeking to escape," was caught "as she was getting over a hedge, and they drew her back again by the hair of the head to the stump of a tree, and there cut off her head with a hatchet.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=237}}</blockquote>

The warriors then dragged the bodies into the house along with the cattle, and set fire to the place, which burned to the ground.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=237}} During the attack, Hutchinson's nine-year old daughter, [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]], is said to have been out picking blueberries, and was found, according to legend, hidden in the crevice of [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], nearby.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=239}} She is believed to have had red hair, unusual to the attackers, and perhaps because of this curiosity her life was spared. She was taken captive and by one account was named "Autumn Leaf",{{sfn|Pritchard|2002|pp=1<U+2013>42}} and lived with the Native Americans for two to six years (accounts vary) until ransomed back to her family members, most of whom were living in Boston.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=228}}

The exact date of the Hutchinson massacre is not known. The first definitive record of the occurrence was in John Winthrop's journal, where it was recorded as the first entry made for the month of September, though not dated.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=479<U+2013>481}} Since it took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news, the event almost certainly occurred in August 1643, and this is the date found in most sources.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=479<U+2013>481}}{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=239}} While some accounts offer an exact date for the massacre, they provide no source or evidence.

The reaction in Massachusetts to Hutchinson's death was predictably harsh. The Reverend [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Thomas Weld]] wrote, "The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed us from our great and sore affliction&nbsp;... I never heard that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman&nbsp;..."{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=12}} [[Peter Bulkley]], the pastor at Concord wrote, "Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any more to do with her leaven."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=243}} Winthrop wrote, "Thus it had pleased the Lord to have compassion of his poor churches here, and to discover this great imposter, an instrument of Satan so fitted and trained to his service for interrupting the passage [of his] kingdom in this part of the world, and poisoning the churches here..."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=244}}  Further, he wrote, "This American Jezebel kept her strength and reputation, even among the people of God, till the hand of civil justice laid hold on her, and then she began evidently to decline, and the faithful to be freed from her forgeries&nbsp;..."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=244}}

After the massacre, Wampage, the warrior who claimed to have slain Hutchinson, had assumed her name, calling himself "Anne Hoeck," thus being honoured by using the name of his most famous victim.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}} Eleven years after the event, Wampage confirmed a deed transferring the Hutchinson's former property to Thomas Pell, with his name on the document being given as "Ann Hoeck alias Wampage."{{sfn|Champlin|1913|p=11}}

== Historical impact ==

=== The role of gender ===

Hutchinson may have been persecuted because in preaching, she was stepping beyond the gender role then considered appropriate for a woman. Some historians suggest that she fell victim to contemporary mores surrounding the role of women in Puritan society. Hutchinson spoke her mind freely within the context of a male hierarchy unaccustomed to outspoken women. John Winthrop described her as "a woman of ready wit and bold spirit".{{sfn|Lauter|2006|p=308}} The extent to which she was persecuted was perhaps proportional to the threat the Puritan clergy saw in her, considering that many people were willing to listen to and follow her. The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds.{{sfn|Lauter|2006|p=308}}

Hutchinson failed to appreciate what the court knew all too well:  that "the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy".{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=65}}  It was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes was the violation of her role in Puritan society.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=65}}  She was thus condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=65}}

=== Heretic label ===

To the chagrin of clergy and colony officials, Hutchinson interpreted the doctrine of the [[Perseverance of the saints]] according to the [[Free Grace theology|Free Grace]] model, which taught that the saved could sin freely without endangering their salvation, instead of the [[Lordship salvation]] model prevalent at that time, which noted that those who were truly saved would demonstrate by seeking to follow the ways of their [[Jesus|Saviour]]. She also claimed that she could identify "the elect" among the colonists.{{sfn|Humpherey|1919|pp=18<U+2013>29}}  These positions ultimately caused John Cotton, John Winthrop, and other former friends to view her as an ''[[Antinomianism|antinomian]] heretic''.{{sfn|Humpherey|1919|pp=18<U+2013>29}}

=== Church and secular politics ===

In his article on Hutchinson in ''Forerunner'' magazine, Jay Rogers articulates the view that Hutchinson's interpretations were not "antithetical to what the Puritans believed at all. What began as the quibbling over fine points of Christian doctrine ended as a confrontation over the role of authority in the colony."{{sfn|Rogers|2008}}  Hutchinson may have criticised the established religious authorities, as did others, but she did so while cultivating an energetic following. That religious following was large enough to be a significant force in secular politics. Hutchinson may have doomed herself by her strong support of [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]], who was replaced by Winthrop who presided at her civil trial<U+2014>as much as for the specific content of her religious views.{{sfn|Rogers|2008}}

=== Modern view ===

Hutchinson is famous not so much for what she did or said during the [[Antinomian Controversy]], but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the ''Short Story''.  Though inaccurately portrayed, to Winthrop, Hutchinson became the reason for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through, and with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}}  Winthrop's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status, and as with all legends, what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}}  To Winthrop, Hutchinson was a "hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy".{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}}  To 19th&nbsp;century America she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of the separation of church and state.  Finally, in the 20th&nbsp;century she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views, but because she was an assertive, highly visible woman.{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=4}}

Historian Michael Winship calls Hutchinson "a prophet, spiritual adviser, mother of fifteen, and important participant in a fierce religious controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=1}}  Upheld equally as a symbol of religious freedom, liberal thinking and [[Christian feminism]], Anne Hutchinson is a contentious figure, having been lionised, mythologised and demonised by various writers. In particular, historians and other observers have interpreted and re-interpreted her life within the following frameworks: the status of women, power struggles within the Church, and a similar struggle within the secular political structure.  As to her overall historical impact, in his 2005 book on Hutchinson and the Free Grace Controversy, Winship writes, "Hutchinson's well-publicized trials and the attendant accusations against her made her the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history."{{sfn|Winship|2005|p=1}}

In front of the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]] in Boston, Massachusetts stands a statue of Anne Hutchinson with her daughter Susanna as a child.  The statue, dedicated in 1922, has an inscription on the marble [[pediment]] that reads:

Another memorial to Hutchinson was erected south of Boston in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], at the corner of Beale Street and Grandview Avenue.  This is near the location where the Hutchinsons owned a 600-acre farm with a house, and this is where they stayed for several days in March 1638 while making the trip from Boston to their new home on [[Aquidneck Island]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=208}}

=== Literary works ===

According to Hutchinson biographer Eve LaPlante, some literary critics trace the character of [[Hester Prynne]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' to Hutchinson's persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=xvii}}  Historian Amy Lang wrote that Hester Prynne was the embodiment of a fictional Anne Hutchinson<U+2014>a Hutchinson created by the early Puritan chroniclers.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=165}}  Lang notes that Hester was what orthodox Puritans said Hutchinson was, either in reality or at least spiritually.{{sfn|Lang|1987|p=165}}  The parallel is that Hutchinson was the heretic who metaphorically seduced the Puritan community, while in Hawthorne's novel Hester Pyrnne literally seduced the minister of her community.{{sfn|Lang|1987|pp=165<U+2013>166}}

Anne Hutchinson and her political struggle with Governor Winthrop are depicted in the 1980 play ''Goodly Creatures'' by [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson]]. Other notable historical characters who appear in the play are Reverend [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]], Governor [[Henry Vane the Younger|Harry Vane]], and future Quaker martyr [[Mary Dyer]].{{sfn|Gibson|1986|p=4}}

=== Namesakes ===

[[File:AnneHutchinsonMaryDyerMemorialHerbGarden.jpg|thumb|<center>Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden at Founders' Brook Park, Portsmouth, Rhode Island|alt=photograph of a multi-coloured carved wooden sign which reads "Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden," behind which is a scenic small waterfall surrounded by green foliage.]]

In southern New York, the [[Hutchinson River]], one of the very few rivers named after a woman, and the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] are her most prominent namesakes.{{sfn|Hutchinson River Parkway}}  Elementary schools, such as in the [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] towns of [[Pelham (town), New York|Pelham]] and [[Eastchester]] are named for her.{{sfn|Pelham Patch|2012}}{{sfn|Anne Hutchinson School|2012}}

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson and her friend, Mary Dyer, the Quaker martyr, have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden, set by a scenic waterfall and historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth.{{sfn|Heritage Passage}}  The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women.  The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organisation, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist, Valerie Debrule. The organisation, called Friends of Anne Hutchinson, meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth, on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne's baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island.{{sfn|Herald News|2011}}

Hutchinson is honoured together with [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] on 5 February.{{sfn|Satucket Lectionary}}

=== Pardon ===

In 1987, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] pardoned Anne Hutchinson, revoking the order of banishment by Governor Winthrop 350&nbsp;years earlier.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=256}}

== Family ==

=== Immediate family ===

Anne and Will Hutchinson had 15 children, all of them born and baptised in Alford except for the last child who was baptised in Boston, Massachusetts.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  Of the 14 children born in England, 11 of them lived to sail to [[New England]].{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}

[[File:Major Thomas Savage.jpg|thumb|left|150px|<center>Major [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]] married Hutchinson's daughter, Faith.|alt=Painting of a balding man with grey hair.  The man is wearing a highly decorated coat, and he is holding a staff of sorts.]]

The oldest child, [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]], baptised 28 May 1613, signed the [[Portsmouth Compact]], and settled on Aquidneck Island with his parents, but soon made peace with the Massachusetts authorities, and returned to Boston.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  He was an officer in the colonial militia, and died from wounds received during [[King Philip's War]].  Susanna, baptised 4 September 1614, died in Alford during the [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1630, and Richard, baptised 8 December 1615 was admitted to the Boston church in 1634, but returned to England, after which no further record has been found.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  Faith, baptised 14 August 1617, married [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]], and lived in Boston, dying about 1651.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}  Bridget, baptised 15 January 1618/9, married [[John Sanford (governor)|John Sanford]] and lived in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] where her husband was briefly governor of the island, and died by 1698.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}  Francis, baptised 24 December 1620, was the oldest of the children to perish in the massacre in [[New Netherland]], and Elizabeth, baptised 17 February 1621/2 died during the plague in Alford, and was buried there on 4 October 1630.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  William, baptised 22 June 1623 died during infancy, and Samuel, baptised 17 December 1624, lived in Boston, married, and had a child, but left behind few records.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  Anne, baptised 5 May 1626 married William Collins, and both of them went to New Netherland and perished in the massacre with her mother.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  Mary, baptised 22 February 1627/8; Katherine, baptised 7 February 1629/30; William, baptised 28 September 1631; and Zuriel (daughter), baptised in Boston 13 March 1635/6, were all children when they went with their mother to New Netherland, and were killed during the Indian massacre in the late summer of 1643.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=480<U+2013>481}}  [[Susanna Cole|Susanna]], the 14th child of the Hutchinsons, and the youngest born in England, baptised 15 November 1633, survived the Indian attack in 1643, was taken captive, and eventually traded to the English, after which she married John Cole, and with him had 11 children.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vii}}

Of Hutchinson's dozen or more siblings who survived childhood, only one other came to New England; her youngest sister, Katharine, the wife of [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard Scott]], came to Boston and then Providence.  With her husband, Katharine was a Puritan, Baptist, and then Quaker, and was whipped in Boston for supporting her future son-in-law [[Christopher Holder]] who had his right ear cut off for his Quaker evangelism.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=272}}

=== Descendants ===

[[File:Stephen A Douglas - headshot.jpg|thumb|150px|<center>[[Stephen A. Douglas]] descends from Hutchinson.|alt=Photograph of a man with longish dark hair; he is wearing formal attire which consists of a dark vest, a white shirt, and a tie of the style worn in 1860.]]

As with many other colonial American settlers, Anne Hutchinson has numerous descendants, many of whom have reached great prominence.  Three United States Presidents, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]], are among her descendants,{{sfn|Roberts|2009|pp=365<U+2013>366}} as are the three United States Presidential aspirants [[Stephen A. Douglas]], [[George W. Romney]], and [[Willard Mitt Romney]].{{sfn|Family Search|2008}}  Her grandson, [[Peleg Sanford]], was a colonial governor of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=171}}  Other descendants include Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, [[Melville Weston Fuller]], and Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]; a [[Lord Chancellor]] of England, John Singleton Copley, Jr. who was the first [[Lord Lyndhurst]]; and a President of Harvard University, [[Charles William Eliot]].  One descendant bearing the Hutchinson name was her ill-fated great-great-grandson, [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], who was a [[loyalist]] Governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] at the time of the [[Boston Tea Party]], an event leading to the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfn|Family Search|2008}}

=== Ancestry ===

In 1914, [[John Denison Champlin, Jr.|John Champlin]] published the bulk of the currently known ancestry of Anne Hutchinson, showing her descent on her father's side of the family from [[Charlemagne]] and [[Alfred the Great]].{{sfn|Champlin|1914|p=18}}  [[Gary Boyd Roberts]] and others have published her line of descent on her mother's side from [[Edward I of England]], thus connecting her with Edward's great grandparents, [[Henry II of England]] and his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]].{{sfn|Roberts|2008|p=278}}{{sfn|Richardson|2004|p=492}}  Most of the material in the following ancestor chart is from Champlin, except for the Williamson line which was published in ''The American Genealogist'' by F. N. Craig in 1992.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=484}}
