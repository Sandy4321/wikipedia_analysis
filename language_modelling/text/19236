'''Hurricane Kyle''' was the fourth longest-lived [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic]] [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] or [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] cyclone on record. The eleventh named storm and third hurricane of the [[2002 Atlantic hurricane season]], Kyle developed as a subtropical cyclone on [[September 20]] to the east-southeast of [[Bermuda]]. Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on [[September 25]]. For the next two weeks, Kyle tracked generally westward, oscillating in strength several times due to fluctuations in environmental conditions. On [[October 11]], the cyclone turned northeastward and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] near [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[Long Beach, North Carolina]] at tropical storm status. After lasting as a cyclone for 22&nbsp;days, Kyle dissipated on [[October 12]] as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.

The hurricane brought light precipitation to Bermuda, but no significant damage was reported there. Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States, causing localized flash flooding and road closures. Floodwaters forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina. Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes, the costliest of which struck [[Georgetown, South Carolina]]; it damaged 106&nbsp;buildings and destroyed seven others, causing eight injuries. Overall damage totaled about $5&nbsp;million (2002&nbsp;USD, $6&nbsp;million 2008&nbsp;USD), and no direct deaths were reported. However, the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the [[British Isles]].

== Storm history ==
{{storm path|Kyle 2002 track.png}}
A [[cold front]] stalled and began weakening to the southeast of [[Bermuda]] on [[September 15]], degenerating into a [[low pressure area]] by [[September 18]]. A stationary circulation developed by [[September 19]], which was believed to have been aided by a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to its west. [[Convection]] developed into narrow [[tropical cyclone#structure|banding features]] far from the center, and the overall structure gradually organized. It is estimated the system developed into Subtropical Depression Twelve late on [[September 20]] about 825&nbsp;miles (1330&nbsp;km) southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical due to the distance of the convection from the center. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on [[September 21]], and as such was named ''[[Kyle]]'' by the [[National Hurricane Center]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

Due to uncertainties in its track, the government of [[Bermuda]] posted a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm watch]] for the island on [[September 30]]; it was discontinued the following day.<ref name="tcr"/> The combination of the storm and a cold front to its north produced 2.19&nbsp;inches (55.6&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in the first two days of October, which was about half of the monthly rainfall total.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bermuda Weather Service|date=2002-11-04|title=Weather Summary for October 2002|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2002-10.html}}</ref>

As Kyle approached the coast of Florida, a tropical storm watch was issued between [[Cocoa Beach, Florida]] to [[Brunswick, Georgia]], and later was extended northward to [[Edisto Beach, South Carolina]]. Early on [[October 11]], a tropical storm warning was put in place between Brunswick, Georgia to [[Cape Fear, North Carolina]], which was later amended to include the [[Pamlico Sound]] and the coastline through [[Surf City, North Carolina]].<ref name="tcr"/> Prior to it making landfall, the [[National Weather Service]] office in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] issued a flood watch for much of the coastline that was ultimately impacted; in South Carolina, a flood warning was issued for the counties of [[Florence County, South Carolina|Florence]], [[Williamsburg County, South Carolina|Williamsburg]], and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]].<ref name="nws1">{{cite web|author=Wilmington, North Carolina National Weather Service|year=2002|title=Statistics for Tropical Storm Kyle|accessdate=2008-05-17|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/ilm/archive/10-11-02/kylestats.html}}</ref> States of emergencies were declared for ten South Carolina counties.<ref>{{cite web|author=South Carolina State Register|year=2002|title=Executive Orders from the Governor's Office|accessdate=2008-05-19|format=DOC|url=http://167.7.215.69/register/index2002.doc}}</ref>
