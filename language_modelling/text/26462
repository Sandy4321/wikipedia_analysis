The '''Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary''' is one of the United States' 13 [[U.S. National Marine Sanctuary|National Marine Sanctuaries]] that protect and preserve ocean ecosystems in the U.S. Cordell Bank is a [[seamount]] approximately 50 miles northwest of [[San Francisco]] where the ocean bottom rises to within 120 feet (37 meters) of the surface. The seamount was discovered in 1853 by the U.S. Coast Survey, and named for Edward Cordell, who surveyed the area more thoroughly in 1869. It was extensively explored and described during 1978-86 by Robert Schmieder, who published a monograph about it [Schmieder, 1991]. It has been protected as a sanctuary since 1989. The protected area encompasses 526 square miles (1347&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of ocean.

The seamount is largely composed of [[granite]], and 93 million years ago was part of the southern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. The [[Pacific Plate]] sheared northwest, moving the seamount to its current location. [[Continental drift]] continues to move the seamount at about 3.5 inches (9 cm) per year. During the most recent [[glaciation]], 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, Cordell Bank may have been an island, since sea level was 360 feet (110 meters) lower.

This unusual granite mountain is surrounded on three sides by deep waters, which allows the flow of deep nutrient-rich waters over relatively shallow waters with sufficient light to support [[photosynthesis]]. The central coast of California, including the Cordell Bank area, is one of the Pacific's great [[upwelling]] regions. The result is that Cordell Bank is an unusually biologically productive area, supporting large and diverse populations of marine life, including many [[seabird]]s and [[marine mammals]].

Sanctuary waters support seabirds both from the nearby [[Farallon Islands]] and [[Point Reyes]], as well as migratory birds from as far away as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. Several species of [[albatross]] are known to frequent Cordell Bank, most commonly the [[Black-footed Albatross]]. Twenty-six different species of marine mammals inhabit the sanctuary, including [[Humpback Whales]], [[Blue Whales]], and [[Steller's Sea Lion]]s. Late summer is the most likely time to find large cetaceans migrating through using the Bank's abundant food resources. [[Leatherback Sea Turtle]]s also inhabit sanctuary waters.

Sanctuary regulations prohibit extraction of hydrocarbons (oil, natural gas), the removal of [[benthic]] (bottom-dwelling) organisms, discharge of wastes, and removal of cultural resources. Recreational [[scuba diving]] is not recommended in the sanctuary due to depth and currents.

Future:
A bill (H.R. 5352) was recently proposed to Congress by local Representative [[Lynn Woolsey]] to expand the size of the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary and the neighboring [[Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary]] by 1,094 square miles.
