Israel has embraced [[solar energy]].  There is no oil on Israeli land and the country's [[Arab<U+2013>Israeli conflict|tenuous relations]] with its oil-rich neighbors made the search for a stable source of energy a national priority.  Israeli innovation and research has advanced solar technology to a degree that it is almost cost competitive with [[fossil fuels]].  Its abundant sun made the country a natural location for the promising technology.  The high annual incident [[solar irradiance]] in the [[Negev Desert]] has spurred an internationally renowned solar research and development industry, with [[Harry Zvi Tabor|Tabor]] and [[David Faiman]] of the [[National Solar Energy Center]] two of its more prominent members.  At the end of 2008 a [[feed-in tariff]] scheme was approved, which immediately put in motion the building of many residential and commercial solar energy power station projects.

== History and development ==
In 1949 [[prime minister]] [[David Ben-Gurion]] sent a letter to England to offer [[Harry Zvi Tabor]] a job on the 'physics and engineering desk' of the [[Research Council of Israel]], which he accepted.  His first task was to create the [[National Physical Laboratory, Israel| Israeli National Physical Laboratory]] to create standards amongst the different measurements in use in the country, primarily [[Imperial units|British]], [[Ancient_Arabic_weights_and_measures|Ottoman]] and [[metric]].<ref name=Bright>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1222017430932 Bright ideas], Ehud Zion Waldoks, ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', October 1, 2008.</ref><ref name=Earth>[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Tabor,_Harry_Zvi Harry Zvi Tabor], Cleveland Cutler, [[Encyclopedia of the Earth]], 2007.</ref>   Once the laboratory was established, he first focused on [[solar energy]] for [[research and development]].

Solar energy was particularly attractive for two reasons.  First, the abundance and strength of the sun's rays on Israeli land.  Israel's [[geographic latitude]] location is on the [[30th parallel north]], where the annual incident [[solar irradiance]] is 2000 [[kWh]] per sq.m.<ref name=mfa>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts%20About%20Israel/Science%20-%20Technology/Solar%20Energy%20in%20Israel Solar Energy in Israel], David Faiman for the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].</ref>  Second, Israeli land lacks oil, and the [[Arab<U+2013>Israeli conflict|conflicts with its neighbors]] made the procurement of a stable source of energy a national priority.  In particular, it is argued that the best defense against missle attack felling the national power grid would be to build a [[Distributed generation|distributed power network]], which would mean solar fields of 25-50 megawatts across Israel. <ref name=Abr>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1033081.html The solar vote], Yosef I. Abramowitz and David Lehreer, ''[[Haaretz]]'', November 2, 2008.</ref>  

Early in the 1950's, Harry Tabor began to examine why solar installations were inefficient.  He eventually devised <U+2018>selective black surfaces<U+2019>, which his team at the National Physical Laboratory modified using [[nickel]] and [[chrome]] methods to blacken metals.  These surfaces became known as [[Tabor surfaces]], which are particularly effective at trapping heat for use in [[solar water heater]]s.<ref>Infrared Technology Fundamentals, by Monroe Schlessinger, Irving J.

=== Solar water heaters ===
In the 1950's there was a fuel shortage in the new Israeli state, and the government forbid heating water between 10 p.m. and 6 p.m.  As the situation worsened, engineer [[Levi Yissar]] proposed that instead of building more electrical generators, homes should switch to solar water heaters.  He built a prototype in his home, and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters.<ref name=Bach/>  By 1967 around one in twenty [[household]]s heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold.<ref name=Bach/>  However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the [[Six Day War]] made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters  dropped.  <ref>[http://www.californiasolarcenter.org/history_solarthermal.html]</ref>  Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the Israeli [[Knesset]] passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy ''[[per capita]]'' (3% of the primary national energy consumption).<ref>[http://www.neaman.org.il/neaman/publications/publication_item.asp?fid=590&parent_fid=490&iid=3639 The Samuel Neaman Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology - Publications - Solar energy for the production of heat Summary and recommendations of the 4th assembly of the energy forum at SNI]</ref>

As of the early 1990s, all new residential buildings were required by the government to install solar water-heating systems, and Israel's National Infrastructure Ministry estimates solar panels for water-heating already satisfy 4% of the country's total energy demand.<ref name=BW/>  Israel and Cypress are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them.<ref name="Environment California SWH">{{cite web

== Feed-in Tariff ==
On June 2, 2008 the Israeli Public Utility Authority approved a [[feed-in tariff]] for solar plants.  The tariff is limited to a total installation of 50MW during 7 years, whichever is reached first, with a maximum of 15 kWp installation for [[residential]] and a maximum of 50kWp for [[commercial]].<ref>[http://www.eng.shirasol.co.il/Approved-Feed-in-tariff-in-Israel.htm Approved - Feed-in tariff in Israel].</ref>  [[Bank Hapoalim]] offered 10 year loans for the installation of solar panels.<ref>[http://new.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000357924&fid=942 Hapoalim offers loans for domestic solar panels], July 3, 2008.</ref>  The National Infrastructures Ministry announced that it would expand the [[feed-in tariff]] scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 kilowatts to 5 megawatts.  The new tariff scheme caused solar company [[Sunday Solar Energy]] to announce that it would invest $133 million to install photovoltaic solar arrays on [[kibbutzim]], which are social communities that divide revenues amongst their members.<ref name=Sunday/>

A prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than 1,000 times greater than standard flat panels.<ref name=BW/>  According to Faiman, who led the Israeli team that developed the technology, 10% of Israel<U+2019>s population (1,000 [[megawatts]]) could live on the energy from 12 [[square kilometres]] of land. <ref name=Green>[http://greenprophet.com/2007/12/16/7/the-light-of-a-thousand-suns/ Zenith Solar<U+2019>s Light of a Thousand Suns], ''Green Prophet'', December 17, 2007.</ref>

=== Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research ===
{{main|Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research}}
The [[Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research]] facility was founded by [[Amos Richmond]], and its faculty is part of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]].  It has a [[Solar power|solar energy]] research program that have assisted in the development of [[Passive solar|passive heating]], involving how extremes of heat and cold in the desert can be mitigated through efficient storage from day to nighttime.  One research project is an an inhabited [[adobe]] house with rational [[fenestration]]. [[Prism]]s that absorb heat during the day are situation in the room, and they can be rotated to allow the heat to discharge at night. 

There is a double skin [[greenhouse]] that uses [[copper]] [[sulfate]] solution as a heat screen during the day. The liquid is pumped between the two skins, protects the interior from [[ultraviolet]] rays and collects heat. At night the liquid is recirculated returning the heat to the greenhouse.
