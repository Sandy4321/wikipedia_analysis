The '''Queensland Public Sector Union''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] for most workers employed by the [[Queensland]] [[Government of Queensland|state government]]. The QPSU operates on an [[organising model]], which entails making delegates and members more participatory in their industrial activism. 

==Union Council and Delegates==
The Union Council is the QPSU's peak decision making body. Every two years the electoral commission holds elections for Council delegates. Each delegate represents members in their agency to ensure all members have a say in their union. In addition, regional branch presidents are also automatically members of the Union Council to ensure the views union members throughout Queensland are represented. Union Council meets five times a year to consider policies and make decisions for the best interests of union members.

! Name!! Responsibilities!! 
|-
| Members
| Persons eligible for membership granted by the constitution's rules of eligibility. Within this model members are the most important sector of the union, informing delegates of their concerns, ideas and strategies for improving workplace conditions. Members' active membership is essential in enterprise bargaining campaigns, wider public campaigns and for the strength of the union
|-
| Delegates 
| Delegates are union members who were elected to be a workplace representative, to report and represent concerns of rank and file members to the Union and respective employing authorities.
|-
| Union Council
|These are delegates elected by the rank and file members of the union body to sit on council. Their role is to discuss, vote and decide on union constitutional matters and policy.
|-
| Executive
| General Secretary and Assistant General Secretary elected by council and members
|-
| Delegate Support Unit
| Specialist staff who liaise with delegates within their allocated departments. The DSU organise collective industrial action and are industrial officers for concerns which concern more than one member.
|-
| Bargaining Team
| A team of specialist industrial staff who negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements and other arbitration matters between members and the relevant departments of the Queensland Government.
|-
| Organising Team 
| Organisers delegate encourage active membership, organise collective action and recruit new members though workplace meetings and inductions.
|-
| Membership Services Centre 
| The area which industrial officers manage the toll free inbound call centre which manage member's individual industrial grievances. The officers undertake caseloads of members who have continuing industrial issues, who need industrial representation. This section of staff can enter workplaces to represent members.
|-
| Information Support Unit - Creative/Communication Team
| This unit also includes communications officers for media releases and media related inquiries, Union newsletter, Umail (emailed updates)and campaign material.
|-
| Information Support Unit
| Clerical staff which handle correspondence, administrative membership issues and financial membership issues. 
|-
| Organising Call Centre
| An outbound call centre of non specialist casually employed staff whose role is surveying members on industrial issues and policy. This call centre is often subcontracted by other [[trade unions]] to perform similar tasks for their respective membership.
|}

==Organising Call Centre==
The Queensland Public Sector Union was the first [[trade union]] in Australia to have an organising call centre (OCC) in 2003. The OCC contacts members after business hours to survey members on union matters. The call centre consists of 10 - 15 activists and university students, who have been trained to collect confidential survey information vital for Union activity.

==ALP affiliation==
The QPSU is not affiliated to the [[Australian Labor Party]] and therefore does not partake in state conferences with the ALP to maintain political neutrality. However, the QPSU typically supports the ALP due to labour policies which would benefit union members. 

==Campaigns==
The QPSU has been involved in the [[Your Rights at Work]] campaign. The QPSU has also had campaigns specifically targeting departments under the [[Queensland]] State Government including; Queensland Department of Health, Queensland Department of Child Safety and  Department of Disability Services Queensland.

==History of the Union==
by Tony Gough

'''Queensland Public Sector Union (QPSU), and its predecessors:
Civil Service White Collar Unionism in Queensland: 1860 <U+2013> 2000'''

[Conversion factor <U+2013> for monetary values expressed in pounds, <U+20A4>, double for dollars, $, viz <U+20A4>200 = $400 rounded.]

===PART ONE===
The purpose of this paper is briefly to trace the history of the QPSU, and its predecessors. It is not intended to be a critical analysis of the various associations, but rather a chronological, descriptive outline of development.

====The Nineteenth Century====
The nineteenth century saw two movements; during the 1860s, an unnamed, amorphous <U+201C>collectivity<U+201D> came into existence, and the 1890s saw the creation and demise of the CIVIL SERVICE ASSOCIATION of QUEENSLAND. If any primary materials relating to these bodies, such as financial records, minute books, membership rolls etc. are still in existence, well at this juncture, they are UNABLE TO BE LOCATED. Nonetheless, there is sufficient information available to permit a picture to emerge.

Queensland, it will be recalled, separated from New South Wales in 1859, and the April 1861 census revealed the Colony had a population of 30 059 (although [verbatim] the Report indicated that the census takers could <U+201C>merely hazard a guess at the number of aboriginals<U+201D>); most of the population was born in England, whilst 20% were <U+201C>currency<U+201D> and Brisbane contained 6051 citizens. It is important to note that 31% of the entire (European) population could neither read nor write, and a further 12<U+00BC>% could read but not write. Civil servants were enumerated at 273, which comprised 142 civil officers and subordinates, and 131 police magistrates, and constables.

Governor Sir George Bowen framed the initial organisation of the Queensland Civil Service, which was based on the United Kingdom model. The prescriptions were published in a supplement to the Queensland Government Gazette [QGG], number seven, of Saturday 21 January 1860. The departments were to be structured thus:-

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  
! MIN.
! ANNUAL INCREMENT
! MAX.
|-
| Clerk Second Class
| <U+20A4>400
| <U+20A4>25
| <U+20A4>475
|-
| Clerk Third Class
| <U+20A4>300
| <U+20A4>25
| <U+20A4>375
|-
| Clerk Fourth Class
| <U+20A4>200
| <U+20A4>20
| <U+20A4>280
|-
| Clerk Fifth Class
| <U+20A4>100
| <U+20A4>15
| <U+20A4>190
|}
Hours of duty were to be 10AM-4PM, and whilst the records say <U+201C>daily<U+201D>, it can be assumed this meant week days only. Bowen further recommended that the Legislature should consider that:
*	a Board of Examiners be appointed;
*	admission to the Third Class be by competitive examination;
*	those admitted be aged between 16 and 25, and be physically fit and morally sound;
*	promotion should be upon recommendation of the Head of Department; and
*	attention should be given to the introduction of a contributory superannuation scheme.

It needs to be interpolated, that whilst it is no doubt tacit, it can be said that an indispensable pre-condition for Civil Servants, and for applicants for admission, was universal literacy. This permits an understanding of processes, the ability to spread information, and promotes the recognition that individuals are part of a wider group, and have an identity of interest. The advantage is bewitching in its simplicity.

On 10 May 1861, the Colonial Secretary, (i.e. Premier) Robert (later Sir Robert) George Wyndham Herbert, introduced into the Lower House, The Civil Service Bill of 1861, and, as extensive as it may be, it is important to provide details, as it will be seen that some of the principles enunciated then have, with modifications, been incorporated into Civil Service Acts, Public Service Awards and Public Service Industrial Agreements during the subsequent one hundred and forty years.

The Civil Service Bill 1861
There were to be two divisions:-
*The ordinary Division, to consist of the Heads of Departments, together with thirty-five nominated senior positions;
Salaries for this class were to be voted for by the Legislative Assembly;
*Subordinate division <U+2013> Salaries:-

*Classification and admission date gazetted annually;
*	Upon enactment, present salaries above these thresholds to remain but increments to be foregone; salaries below to be raised
*	Admission by examination and six months probation at half salary <U+2013> balance paid upon appointment;
*	Promotion by Governor-in-Council, but outside appointment permitted if no internal suitable candidate;
*	Annual reports on proficiency;
*	Breaches of discipline punished by dismissal, or reduction of grade or salary;
*	If officers position to be abolished, then leave of absence on half salary granted (but no specification as to duration) but with the prospect of re-appointment;
*	One month annually leave on full pay, but relief to be undertaken by an internal <U+201C>brother officer<U+201D>;
*	Twelve month<U+2019>s leave of absence on full pay after ten years of service;
*	Superannuation contribution 2%;
*	Superannuation available at age sixty, after at least ten years service.
*	After ten years service, pension at 10/60ths of previous three years service average annual salary <U+2013> 1/60th per each additional years service, to a maximum of 2/3rds salary
*	Allowance can be commuted (no conversion factor stated)
*	Disability allowance <U+2013> two months pay per year of service or identical payment to widow upon death in service.

There was opposition to this Bill in the Lower House, and the principal advocate against it was Charles (later Sir Charles) Lilley, the Member for Fortitude Valley. (Prior to his appointment to the Judiciary, known as Lilley of the Valley)

Herbert perceived that the numbers were against him, and sought to save the measure by suggesting that perhaps a Select Committee should be appointed to <U+201C>look into the matter, and in particular the Superannuation Clauses<U+201D> and report thereon. The motion of Lilley, to the effect that the Bill be discharged from the notice paper, was in late June 1861 on division carried by thirteen to eleven.

The surviving material is threadbare; perhaps stumbling blocks were the issue of subsidisation of the superannuation scheme, together with the resistance of the Civil servants as to what was seen as a salary reduction. Nonetheless, the failure of the Bill provided a valuable lesson, not lost on the Civil servants of the day, because within twenty four months they had formed a Committee, and they themselves had drafted a Bill for presentation to Parliament. This became the Civil Service Act of 1863, 27 Vic., No. 18, the first legislative instrument to govern the Queensland Civil Service.

The Brisbane Courier of Wednesday July 22 1863, p1. col. 2. carried this advertisement:-

<blockquote>"CIVIL SERVICE
The members of the CIVIL SERVICE are requested to attend a meeting at the Volunteer Armoury, this afternoon, the 22nd. Inst. At 4.30pm., to receive the report of the Committee.
William Martin Boyce. Hon. Sec. </blockquote>

Whilst it would be unsupportable to designate this activity as a <U+201C>Union<U+201D>, or even an <U+201C>Association<U+201D>, it is most certainly evidence of collective action designed to secure <U+201C>industrial entitlements<U+201D>.

Press reports of the time indicated that there had been a <U+201C>series of meetings and prolonged deliberations amongst gentlemen connected with the Civil Service who had framed a Bill which was to be submitted to the criticism of Parliament<U+201D><U+2019> and, moreover, during the second reading speech on Wednesday 12 August 1863, Herbert indicated that <U+201C>the Bill was the result of deliberations of the Civil Servants of the Colony assembled together, and had been put into shape by their Committee appointed to bring it before Parliament<U+201D>. At the invitation of that Committee, <U+201C>he brought it before the House<U+201D>.

The Civil Service was to be divided into the Professional and Ordinary Divisions, each of five classes:

*Annual publication of lists;
*	Appeal mechanism if officer believes under-classified;
*	If office  held abolished then one month salary per year of service;
*	Age seventeen upon appointment on probation on minimum <U+20A4>100;
*	Promotion upon seniority;
*	Bankruptcy brings dismissal;
*	Four weeks annual leave;
*	After ten years service, twelve month<U+2019>s leave on half salary;
*	2% compulsory superannuation contribution;
*	at age 60, for ten years service, 15/60th of salary as pension; 1/60th per each additional year; but not to exceed 40/60th;
*	former officers of New South Wales permitted to <U+201C>buy-back<U+201D> pre-separation years of service;
*	upon incapacity or death, gratuity of 2 months salary per year of service provided;
*	annual increases and deductions commence on January 1 1864.

Almost immediately following this Instrument was the CIVIL SERVICE ACT OF 1863 EXTENSION ACT OF 1864, 28 Vic., No. 12, which extended the range of officers entitled to participate in Superannuation, and slightly altered the prescriptions of erstwhile New South Wales officers to <U+201C>BUY BACK YEARS OF SERVICE<U+201D>.

Some comment needs to be made on the <U+201C>twelve months leave on half pay after ten years service<U+201D> provision. How else, it can be asked, could an expatriate English salaryman accumulate the paid time and garner the financial wherewithal again to see red tunics and bearskin caps? Or, put more brutally, it was a raid by metropolitans upon the colonial purse. Indeed, it can be concluded, that money is thicker than (for that era) industrial quiescence! A gauge of the attractiveness is to be found in a notice, published in QGG Vol.5, No.40, Saturday 7 May 1864, p305, and repeated in following issues at pp 317 and 346:
<blockquote>
''Colonial Secretary<U+2019>s Office
Brisbane, 4 May 1864
In consequence of very numerous applications for employment in the Civil Service, it is notified for public information, that there are now no vacancies to be filled up, and that the Government is not likely to require additional clerks or other employees for a considerable time to come.
No applications can henceforth be received at this office; and those persons who have been for some time endeavouring to obtain appointments in the Civil Service are strongly recommended to seek other employment, as the Government will not be able to provide for them.
Sgd Robert G.W. Herbert''
</blockquote>

Another remarkable development, about which very little is known, needs to be recorded. The Brisbane Courier of Friday, 10 March 1865, p.1, col. 3, carried this notice:

<blockquote>
<blockquote> ''PROPOSED CIVIL SERVICE CLUB
Parties willing to tender for providing suitable accommodation for a CLUB HOUSE or to lease premises for same can obtain further particulars by applying to the undersigned.
Offers to be sent in before noon, Saturday 16th inst.
	William Martin Boyce. Hon. Sec.''
</blockquote>

The activities can be traced only through newspaper advertisements, show that Club House premises were obtained in Charlotte Street, and it was announced that the CIVIL SERVICE CLUB was open for members on Friday August 25, 1865. There was certainly catering provided, and possibly a reading room. The second half of the 1860s in Queensland was marked by an almost annual attempt to repeal the Civil Service Acts of 1863 and 1864. The severe financial crisis of 1866 generated (for this era) the most remarkable activity.

The Brisbane Courier of Friday, 28 September 1866, p1, col.2, had this paid advertisement:

<blockquote>
''THE CIVIL SERVICE''
''A meeting of all members of the CIVIL SERVICE will be held at the Civil Service Club, Charlotte St, this afternoon at 4.30pm for the preparation of a petition to be addressed to Parliament against the repeal of the Civil Service Act.
UNSIGNED''
</blockquote>

The petition, signed by some one hundred and twenty officers, can be found in Votes and Proceedings, 1867 Vol 1, part 1, pp641, 642. It can therefore be said that this unnamed informal collective was prepared to and able to act in concert to obtain <U+201C>industrial conditions<U+201D>; was prepared in howsoever a nascent fashion to seek to defend them; and willing to put in place social and meeting facilities for the benefit of members. It also can be seen that there was a degree of professionalism in the direction of the Club, as it can be proven that towards the end of the decade, a paid Manager, and a paid Providore, and a paid Steward, were engaged. By 1867, for some inexplicable reason, it had been renamed UNION CLUB, but it continued in the existing premises.

An attitude, that was to bedevil the succession of later associations, became evident at this early stage <U+2013> the movement was BRISBANE CENTRIC. Time and time again, non-metropolitan civil servants would in letters to the Editor of the Brisbane papers raise the complaint <U+2013> <U+201C>And what about us?<U+201D> <U+2013> and contemporaneous issues of distance and communication aside, it was not until the close of the 20th century, that this legitimate issue was addressed, and solved.

Finally, in 1869, the Civil Service Act of 1863, and the extension Act of 1864 were repealed. All that was saved by the Civil Service Acts Repeal Act 33 Vic., No.3, was the rights of existing officers, and officers could elect to withdraw from contributing to Superannuation, and could upon application withdraw their contributions with interest at <U+20A4>5 per cent for one half of the period of contributing.

It might at this juncture be appropriate to discuss an organisation about which very little is known. The second edition of the Brisbane Telegraph of Saturday 30 January 1892, p5, col.1, provided a resum<U+00E9> of the thirty-sixth half-yearly report of the Civil Service Co-operative Company (or Stores), whence this body must have been inaugurated circa 1874.

Again, no primary records can be located, but it can be asserted that the Board of Management comprised Civil Servants acting in an honorary capacity, and paid staff were employed. Some measure of the size of the undertaking can be seen in the fact that the turnover in the Grocery and Boot Departments for the period under review (i.e. the second half of 1891) was <U+20A4>18688 ($37376) which, it was revealed, was a decrease of <U+20A4>1097 [$2194] over the corresponding period for the preceding year. The Directors decreed that a dividend of ten percent be paid to members holding co-operative shares. There is no material to hand to indicate when this co-operative ceased operation. Nonetheless, it can be concluded, that the Civil Servants of the era were on the one hand interested in salary levels received, and in their prudent disbursement, on the other.

With the repeal of the 1860s Acts, it can be said that the demon of unintended consequences did not surface until some two decades later. With the abolition of a mandatory retiring age of sixty, and with the removal of the employer controlled post-employment income support scheme for officers appointed after 1869, there simply was no obligation, much less financial sense to cease employment; officers continued to turn up for work, and it was not until the arrival of the latter part of the 1880s, that the Colonial Government created a Royal Commission to inquire into he organisation of the Civil Service.

The upshot of this was the Civil Service Act of 1889, 53Vic., No10, and it was this instrument, or, more precisely, the Superannuation prescriptions it contained, that provided the springboard for the creation of the Civil Service Association of Queensland. The inaugural meeting was convened on Tuesday 18 February 1890, and it ceased existence on Tuesday 14 May 1895. The journal The Week of Saturday 5 January 1889, p6, cols.2&3, reported that <U+201C><U+2026>The dissatisfaction which had long been felt in regard to the alleged overgrowth and partial incapacity of the Civil Service induced the Government to appoint a strong Commission to inquire into the condition of the whole service.<U+201D> The Chair was Theodore Unmack, M.L.A.

The Commission recommended a Civil Service Act which was designed to remedy what was seen as the main evils present:-
*To create a Civil Service Board;
*To institute competitive entry examinations to avoid patronage and nepotism in appointment;
*To institute a better system of classification; and
*To institute a compulsory system of insurance for Civil Servants.

It was the last mentioned that lies at the heart of the issue. Unmack, during the Commission sittings and during the debates on the Bill, held that the Victorian principle ought to be adopted. In that Colony, upon initial appointment, an officer was obliged to secure for himself an insurance policy on his life, and to provide a certificate to that effect, to the employing authority.

Nonetheless, when the Bill came down, [male] officers were compelled to pay an unsubsidised contribution of 4 % of salary. Because for officers appointed post 1869 there was no scheme, most had entered into life insurance policies. Whence, it can readily be seen that widespread dismay was engendered by the new obligation compulsorily to purchase something that they already had. The Evening Observer of Thursday 6 February 1890, p2, col.1, and the Brisbane Courier of Friday 7 February 1890, p4, col.2, said:

<blockquote>
''The Provisional Committee of the Civil Service Association have drawn up the following circular which has been forwarded to every member of the Civil Service:-
We beg to inform you that it is intended to hold a general meeting of members of the Civil Service at the Courier Hall on Tuesday the 18th inst. at 4:30, to consider the advisableness of forming an Association on the lines of those in existence in Victoria and South Australia. In the former Colony, the association has been highly successful, numbering over 2000 members, whilst in South Australia there are over 700 members, and the results attained by both have been very beneficial to the members. The probable objects of the association would be to facilitate all discussion of matters affecting the general welfare, to promote the interests of the civil service generally, and the encouragement of a spirit of unity and fellowship therein. We have communicated to the Chief Secretary, and the Civil Service Board with satisfactory results; and in promoting the formation of such an association we wish it understood that it is our desire that the Association should act in harmony with the Board, mainly as a means of communicating an expression of opinion on matters affecting the interests of the Civil Service.''
</blockquote>

The organisers certainly had communicated with their interstate counterparts, some sort of funding must have become available, but the authors were keen to announce that co-operation rather than militancy was to be the central motif. This inaugural meeting provided a formal Provisional Committee of twenty-five officers, and it is recorded that some four hundred (male) officers attended. After two intermediate <U+201C>organisational<U+201D> meetings, the gathering of Tuesday April 23, 1890, resulted in the following:-

PRESIDENT: John McDonnell, Under-Secretary, Post & Telegraph Dept;
VICE PRESIDENT: Thomas Mulhall King, Treasury, Customs Office, Collector and Chief Inspector of Distilleries;
VICE PRESIDENT: Daniel Cannon McGroarty, Public Instruction, District Inspector;
SECRETARY: Robert Rendle, Registrar of Friendly Societies, Accountant and Valuer;

together with a committee of no fewer than twenty officers representing various Ministerial Departments, but, of course, all from Brisbane offices. Initial focus of the association was to secure repeal of the superannuation prescriptions. The Queenslander of 9 August 1890, p281, col.3, printed a complete text of a petition submitted to the Parliament:-

<blockquote>
''That whereas the contribution to the Superannuation Fund provided under section 58 of the Civil Service Act of 1889 presses heavily on a large section of the Civil Service, and especially on those who have made ample provision by life insurance or otherwise, and whereas grave doubts exist as to the ultimate solvency of the fund, and whereas under section 67 no claim for compensation can hold should the said fund prove insolvent: Your petitioners therefore pray that you will see fit to take action for their relief by a repeal of part IV of the Civil Service Act of 1889, and by providing in place thereof some scheme of compulsory insurance on the endowment principle, maturing at age 60, exempting those at present in the service who can show that they made equivalent provision by life insurance, investment in real estate, or otherwise, such provision to be protected against hypothecation in such a way as may be satisfactory to the Civil Service Board, and, further ,your petitioners pray that you will take action at an early date, as should the contribution continue to be enforced, in many cases hardship and loss will ensue through the compulsory forfeiture of policies already effected, and the abandonment of other provident undertakings.''
</blockquote>

This clearly demonstrates the willingness of voluntary officials to discharge a responsibility in a most commendable fashion. Despite deputations to the Chief Secretary [i.e. Premier] Samuel (later Sir Samuel) Walker Griffith the Government did not repeal the prescriptions. The dismay with the scheme, moreover, was not confined to the professional and clerical ranks. In a report in the Brisbane Courier of Friday 8 January 1892, p5, col.7, it was indicated that at the Queensland Teachers Association Annual Conference a motion was carried to the effect that the <U+201C>Superannuation Clauses be repealed<U+201D>. In addition, an unnamed delegate advised that he had been advised by UNMACK, that the <U+201C>scheme is hopelessly insolvent, and the money will have to be returned.<U+201D>

The Brisbane Telegraph of Friday 30 January 1891, p3, col.4 provided coverage of the first Annual Report, for the (part) calendar year 1890.

The Hon. Secretary, Robert Rendle advised that since the election of the Committee in early 1890, they had:
*Met fourteen times;
*Average attendance fourteen out of twenty-six;
*A set of standing orders had been drawn up;
*Copies of the rules and a circular detailing the objects of the association had been distributed throughout the colony;
*The office was rented at <U+20A4>1/5/- ($2.50) per week, and furnishing had cost <U+20A4>75 ($150);
*The office was open daily from 4:00pm <U+2013> 10:00pm;
*The first issue of the monthly journal appeared in July 1890 <U+2013> sent free to members;
*The cost for the six issues was <U+20A4>11/5/9 ($22.59) which was almost covered by advertising revenue;
*Submissions were made to the Civil Service Board re
**Appointment of a non civil servant,
**Regulations on granting leave,
*Submissions were made to the Minister of Works respecting the sanitary conditions of some of the offices.

For the future, with notable prescience, Rendle advanced the notion that "Steps should be taken to appoint 'departmental secretaries' (i.e. in modern day parlance, workplace delegates) throughout the service, as the organisation of the Association is 'open to improvement';

And finally the balance sheet showed:-
Receipts for calendar year 1890 - <U+20A4>181/13/9 ($363.39)
Expenditure - <U+20A4>165/7/3 ($330.73)
Balance - <U+20A4>16/7/6 ($32.76)

Whilst the agitation against the Superannuation contributions continued, other activities were put in place. In February 1891, the original office in Elizabeth Street was relocated to <U+201C>Centennial Hall<U+201D>, in Adelaide Street. At the end of August that year, the reading room, which remained open until 10pm each week night was closed, <U+201C>due to lack of patronage<U+201D>. The <U+201C>Civil Service Journal<U+201D>, which included a section for the Teachers Association, did not meet with the appreciation and support that it deserved, and the decision to reduce it by one third was taken. Efforts were made to conduct interstate sporting events against the NSW Association at Tenterfield, and whilst concerts were provided in Centennial Hall, it seems that <U+201C>attendance was poor<U+201D>.

Press reports of subsequent Annual General Meetings reveal that the fabric of CSAQ was loosely knit, and despite efforts of the Committee in industrial, social and sporting areas, the flavour is one of struggle to maintain velocity, keenness and participation.

The 1892 Report included the statements that:
*It cannot be expected that the desired ends will be accomplished unless members are prepared to sink minor differences, and give committee practical support;
*It is even difficult to get in the subscriptions at 5/- (0.50<U+00A2>) per annum; and
*They were not going to strike or anything of that sort<U+2026> and if the Association were allowed to fall into decay there would be no one to take the steps necessary for placing the Civil Servants views before the Government.
The following year had much of the same vein:
*The efforts to secure repeal of the Superannuation clauses had brought continued disappointment;
*The civil Service journal had been well received, particularly in the country districts, but it was to be regretted that so little practical assistance had been given to the Editor;
*The membership shows a falling-off in the town; and
*At such time as the present it is more than ever needful for the members of the Service to hold together and work together for the common good and not to show that they are incapable of practical cohesion merely because they have so far been disappointed in their efforts to obtain redress.

The Annual General Meeting of Monday 29 January 1894, with one notable exception, continued in an identical vein. The exception concerned the CIVIL SERVICE SPECIAL RETRENCHMENT ACT OF 1894 58 Vic No.6 which reduced salaries of the Civil Service  for the financial year ending 30 June 1895. The first <U+20A4>150 ($300) of salary was exempted <U+2013> no salary was to be reduced below this figure <U+2013> and the reduction was 10%. The Committee of the Association was pleased to report that action taken by them made the reduction limited to twelve months, and not the permanent reduction sought by the Government.

It is of significant importance, for developments in the early twentieth century, and of equally significant importance down to the present day, to note that Rendle insisted that insofar as superannuation was concerned, the only satisfactory scheme should mirror that of the South Australian Teachers<U+2019> Fund, whereby the contributors had a measure of control by direct election of their own trustees. His proposal (which took until 1 January 1913 to accomplish) was for five trustees, three to be elected directly by the service. What was possible in South Australia, he insisted, <U+201C>could not be considered impractical here<U+201D>.

The report noted that the finances of the Association were poor, with a small deficit showing. It may soon be necessary <U+201C>to abandon the journal<U+201D> and a plea was made for more general support. The journal was further reduced by 50%, and a move to increase annual subscription from 5/- /(0.50<U+00A2>) to 6/- (0.60<U+00A2>), failed. However, success brought demise. On 11 December 1894, assent was given to the CIVIL SERVICE ACTS AMENDMENT ACT of 1894 58 Vic. No.29, which from 1 December 1894 repealed the Superannuation clauses, and contributions were returned with interest at <U+20A4>4 ($8.00) per cent.

The Annual Report tabled at the meeting held on Wednesday 31 January 1895 claimed (correctly) that it was the efforts of the Association that achieved this success. However, the end was in sight. Sufficient widespread support from the membership and Civil Servants at large had not been forthcoming. Publication of the Journal ceased.

The financial statement read:-
Opening balance - <U+20A4>9/3/11 ($18.40)
Receipts for year 1894 - <U+20A4>77/7/10 ($154.80)
Expenditure 1894 - <U+20A4>85/8/4 ($170.85)
Credit balance - <U+20A4>1/3/5($2.35)

There is some merit in providing the reports of the final meeting of the CSAQ, taken from the Evening Observer, Wednesday 15 May 1895, p3, col.5, and the Brisbane Courier, of even date, p6, col.2.


<blockquote>''CIVIL SERVICE ASSOCIATION''
Presentation to Mr Rendle
A large number of members of the Civil Service Association met last night, in the Trades Hall, for a social evening, and to take part in a presentation to Mr Robert Rendle, the honorary secretary of the Association.
Mr Justin Oxenham, who presided, prior to the presentation, gave a sketch of the events which led up to it. He said that most of those present would remember an afternoon in the Courier Building, some five years ago, when the Civil Service Association was launched into the world, with such flourish of trumpets. Mr Rendle was chosen as first secretary and he thought they all agreed that the choice could not have fallen upon a better man. The interest he had shown in the association had been patent to them all, not only as Secretary to the Association, but also as Editor and General Manager of the <U+201C>CIVIL SERVICE JOURNAL<U+201D>.
Mr Rendle had tendered service which should call forth their warmest esteem and regard. No one perhaps outside the committee knew the amount of time and labour that Mr Rendle gave in conducting the Journal and he was sure that no one was more disappointed than Mr Rendle when the funds of the association rendered it necessary to discontinue publication. He could not speak too highly of the way in which Mr Rendle had discharged his secretarial duties; always at his post; always punctual and courteous and with the interests of his fellow civil servants at heart. There being a general recognition of his services, it was only natural that a number of the Association should have got together to see if they could not put into some practical shape the opinion they held for him.
A committee was formed, and subscriptions solicited throughout the Colony on behalf of a testimonial. The Committee limited the maximum subscription to 2/6 (0.25<U+00A2>), for which they were hauled over the coals by a number of the Service in distant parts. Not only had subscriptions come in freely from all quarters of the colony, but letters had been received expressing high appreciation of Mr Rendle<U+2019>s services. It might be invidious to refer to a particular Department where all had helped, but he must say that the Education Department (sic) rallied most generously in answering the request of the Committee.
Mr Rendle<U+2019>s connection with the Committee was such that all members who had worked with him felt for him the most sincere regard.
Mr D.G. MacGroarty, the President of the Association, in moving the presentation of a purse of sovereigns to Mr Rendle, said that Mr Rendle had filled the position of Hon. Sec. to the Association with credit to himself and to the Association. To Mr Rendle should be given the credit of initiating the Association. The largest question taken up by the Association was the repeal of the Superannuation clauses, and in that Mr Rendle had rendered admirable service. Of course, a section of the Service would have rather seen to those clauses amended, and he (McGroarty) held that opinion; but in that, as in all important questions, the majority must rule, and it was quite evident that a very large majority of the Service were in favour of repeal. 
Mr Rendle responded, and said that he found it almost impossible to express his thanks for the cordial recognition for his past services. The most of the credit was due to the Committee, of which he had only been an Executive Officer. He said he thought the Association should be kept in existence, as there was still a very great need for it. Whatever he had done, he had been rewarded by the many friendships he had made.''
</blockquote>

And with this, the short-lived Civil Service Association of Queensland passed from geography into history.

However, valuable lessons were learnt from these events. With the arrival of the turn of the century and the advent of Federation some of these actors, most notably Rendle, were at the forefront of the inauguration of the PUBLIC SERVICE ASSOCIATION OF QUEENSLAND which came into existence in 1902. The Brisbane Courier of Tuesday 16 September 1902 p4 col.5 revealed that:

<blockquote>
''An attempt is being made to revive the Civil Service Association. A meeting is to be held on Wednesday evening in the Albert Hall, for this purpose, and Mr J Osborne, Secretary of the New South Wales Association, is specially visiting to deliver an address on the occasion.''

'''''Part Two of this paper will trace the history of the QPSU and its predecessors during the twenty-first century.'''''

===PART TWO===

Part one of this paper set out briefly to trace the history of the QPSU and its predecessors during the nineteenth century. The paper is not intended to be a critical analysis of the various Associations, but rather a chronological, descriptive outline of development. The 1860s saw an un-named amorphous <U+201C>collectivity<U+201D> of Queensland Civil Servants who advanced their <U+201C>industrial<U+201D> interests, who created a Civil Service Club, who organised sporting and social events, and who inaugurated the CIVIL SERVICE CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETY. <U+201C>Industrial<U+201D> activity largely ceased with the repeal in 1869 of the 1863 and 1864 Civil Service Acts, and the Civil Services Act of 1889, or, more precisely the  SERVICE ASSOCIATION OF QUEENSLAND which commenced in February 1890; with the repeal of the Superannuation prescriptions in the last mentioned Act in 1894, this organisation ceased  operation on Tuesday 14 May 1895. For these bodies, as well as for their counterparts in the twentieth century, it can be asserted that the major focus was salaries, superannuation, hours of work, and other conditions of employment. Nevertheless substantial journals were (and are) produced and widespread sporting, recreational and social activities were organized for the membership.

Attention now can be turned to the continuity of associations which existed, and continued to exist, during the twentieth century, and down to the present day.

Federation arrived, and the basis of State finances dramatically was altered. Under the <U+201C>Braddon Clause<U+201D> of the Constitution (sec. 87) the Commonwealth was obliged for the first decade of the twentieth century to remit three quarters of their revenue from Customs and Excise to the States, and the Federal Treasurer (Sire George Turner) was alert to the problems of his State counterparts, whose budgets now depended largely upon what they would receive from their share of this revenue. For the twelve months ending 30 June 1902, government expenditure in Queensland exceeded revenue by <U+20A4>431939/15/9 [$863879.59].

In this era, standard, or orthodox view of the role of the State was that its function was one of benevolent neutrality; Keynes, and the concept of deficit financing was a generation into the future. Balance the books, was the notion alive. The Brisbane Courier editorial at 1 August 1902 insisted that <U+201C><U+2026>the business of the State can only be managed on the same lines as the business of a private firm, and a deficiency can only be met by curtailment of expenditure, or increase in revenue<U+2026><U+201D>

As a consequence, the government of Robert (later Sir Robert) Philp increased hours of work by five per week, and with the SPECIAL RETRENCHMENT ACT OF 1902 2nd Edw. No 3, for the period between 1 August 1902 and 1 October 1904 reduced <U+201C>Public Servants<U+201D> salary thus:
*No salary will be reduced below <U+20A4>100 [$200] p.a.;
*Salaries between:
<U+20A4>100 [$200] - <U+20A4>150 [$300]	less 7<U+00BD> %
<U+20A4>150 [$300] - <U+20A4>300 [$600]	less 10 % 
<U+20A4>300 [$600] - <U+20A4>450 [$900]	less 12 % 
<U+20A4>450 [$900]			less 15 % 

The Brisbane Courier of Tuesday, 16 September, 1902 p4, col.5, said:
{blockquote}
An attempt is being made to revive the Civil Service Association. A meeting is to be held on Wednesday evening in the Albert Hall, for this purpose, and Mr J Osborne, Secretary of the New South Wales Association, is visiting Brisbane purposely to address the meeting.
{/blockquote}

Whilst complete records are at present not locatable, viz, correspondence, financial transactions, membership rolls etc., it can be recorded that during 1983 a search at the then storage rooms of the QUEENSLAND STATE SERVICE UNION OF EMPLOYEES  at 67 Elizabeth Street, Brisbane, by chance turned up the minute books from 1902 forward. The then President, Peter Harten, and General Secretary, Jim Munro, arranged for this property to be donated to and stored in John Oxley Memorial Library. Volume one, (un-numbered) Folio one, has a copy of the initiating memorandum:

{blockquote}
<U+201C>Kindly arrange for election of one of your staff to represent your department on the PROVISIONAL COMMITTEE the first meeting of which will be held on Wednesday evening next in the Oddfellows Hall, Charlotte Street, at 8.00pm sharp. As it is very important that every department in the service should be represented, a full attendance is requested.
By request
Chas. Mountford Allen
Treasury, 19th September 1902<U+201D>
{/blockquote}

Thus the foundation of the Public Service Association of Queensland (PSAQ), the Queensland Public Service of General Officers Association (Q.P.S.G.O.A), the Queensland Professional Officers Association (QPOA), the Queensland State Service Union of Employees (QSSU), the Queensland Public Sector Alliance (QPSA), the State Public Services Federation (SPSF), and finally, the Queensland Public Sector Union (QPSU) saw the light of day. The inaugural Chair was Arthur Exley, the headmaster at the Ithaca State Primary School, the Hon. Sec. Chas. Mountford Allen, and, amongst twenty-four delegates, it can not go unnoticed, that the Registrar, Supreme Court attended; it was Arthur Hoey Davis!

NOTE: The Supreme Court in 1902 occupied the identical site as it does today. The rowing fraternity had their boat sheds on the north bank of the Brisbane River, upstream from the Victoria Bridge; that is, immediately adjacent to the Supreme Court Buildings. Davis took a participative role in that sport. When he sought to publish his work, he needed, as a public servant, a nom-de-plume, and his first choice was STEELE RUDDER. His editor, quite understandably, remonstrated with him, and demanded that he alter it: whence STEELE RUDD.

By December 1902, it was reported that membership was 600, and the financial statement to the end of that calendar year showed:

INCOME		<U+20A4>95/4/-		$190.40

EXPENDITURE	<U+20A4>12/14/-	$  25.40

BALANCE		<U+20A4>82/10/-	$165.00

Meetings were held in various locations, including at the Civil Service Stores building, a jury room in the District Courts, a rented room in Celtic Chambers, George Street (between Queen and Adelaide Streets), as well as at 48 Elizabeth Street. The PSAQ was in touch with their interstate and now federal colleagues, and correspondence with international counterparts in New Zealand, Ireland, USA and South Africa was conducted. A high quality journal was produced monthly in conjunction with the Queensland Teachers Union. It was entitled Queensland Education Journal and Public Service Review; alas, it appears only one copy survives and it is that of Vol XIV No. 9 issued at Brisbane on 1 December 1908.

PSAQ provided reading rooms, a billiard table, held social functions, including cruises on the <U+201C>QGV Lucinda<U+201D>, had an orchestra, held interstate telegraphic chess matches, commenced a Sports Union, and sponsored an Annual Ball. The notion to form a Public Service Club (not realized until the 1960s) arose, a Bowkett Society for Public Servants was formed, and a 1906 motion to permit females to elect a member to Executive was lost, on the grounds of <U+201C>chivalry<U+201D>.

It was superannuation that was again the focus of attention.

November 1903 saw a superannuation sub-committee of PSAQ formed, with Robert Rendle as its driving force. Over a period of several years, material was obtained from interstate counterparts, frequent reports were submitted to PSAQ Executive, letters on the issue were dispatched to all Queensland Ms LA and Ms LC, and deputations waited upon various Premiers. In late 1909 a Superannuation Bill was to go before the Lower House, and a Special Meeting of PSAQ decided to lobby against the measure, as it was argued that the disadvantages were:
*No government subsidy provided;
*No employee representation on superannuation Board;
*For officers over forty-five years of age, the contribution rates were absolutely prohibitive;
*The greatest weakness was the proposed treatment of females and bachelors, who, if they died during service, would leave their survivors/legatees not entitled to any benefit.

The Government took no further action on that Bill, and a multi-union committee from PSAQ, QTU and Grand Council of Railway Unions was formed to press the issue.

By mid 1912 it was clear that the Government would bring down a Superannuation Bill embracing those requirements advanced by the prospective contributors.

At page twelve of The History of the Queensland Government Professional Officers Association (Whitehouse G, and Wiltshire K., Brisbane RAIPA 1986) it is stated:

I.	<U+201C><U+2026>The Queensland Government Professional Officers<U+2019> Association was created on August 29th 1912<U+2026><U+201D> and
II.	<U+201C><U+2026> There is no clear record of the formal reasons for establishment of the POA, but all the indications from those early days point to the fact that the professional members of the service believed that their interests were not being catered for by the existing organisation<U+2026><U+201D> (i.e. the PSAQ)

I.	On 9 August 1912 PSAQ received correspondence from QPOA that the latter organization existed, and
II.	QPOA was formed to control the process of appointing their delegate to the Superannuation Board.

The upshot was the creation of the Queensland Public Service General Officers Association. It can be concluded that Public Service unionists struggled for a decade to obtain a satisfactory superannuation scheme. The price paid, however, was to engender disunity, to create two parallel organizations, to duplicate facilities and expenses, at a cost that cannot be measured. It took until 1992 to glue the two unions back together<U+2026>. but, then, what is eight decades, between friends?

Robert Rendle was appointed a Government Representative on the Superannuation Board, (as was J.D. Story) and he was Manager and Executive Officer. QGG Vol. CI, 1 July to 31 December 1913, issue 5, 5 July 1913, p24 lists the Divisional Representatives as:-

PROFESSIONAL	        Gustav Theodore Emmanuel REINHOLD	(Survey Office)
ORDINARY		William Henry AUSTIN			(Audit Office)
TEACHERS		Arthur EXLEY				(Head Teacher).

1915 saw the election of the Labor Government of T.J. Ryan, and, whilst the face of Queensland was changed by their legislative program, this paper needs only to deal with the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

The Queensland Industrial Gazette, at p780 of 10 November 1917 records that the first certificate of registration was issued on 24 January 1917 to the Public Service General Officers<U+2019> Association of Queensland (PSGOAQ).

Further, before the development of present day awards, QGG Vol CIX No. 203 of Monday 19 November 1917 records an (industrial) agreement between the Honourable Edward Granville THEODORE (n<U+00E9>e TEODORESCU), the Treasurer of the State of Queensland for and on behalf of the Government, and Frederick William MOLE, State President of the PSGOAQ, an Industrial Union registered under the Act.

The agreement embraced conditions such as salary for classified and unclassified officers, probation, allowances for travelling, remote area allowance, relieving, overtime, hours of duty (9.00am <U+2013> 4.00pm Mon-Fri, 9.00am-12.30pm Sat), sick leave, recreation leave as well as long service leave.

The difficulties of distance, and the view that white collar Civil Service Unionism in Queensland belonged to <U+201C>Queen Street<U+201D> and not the regions can be seen in the application in 1918 for registration as an Industrial Association by the North Queensland Public Service Union of Employees.

The Registrar refused the registration and the appeal was dismissed on the <U+201C>conveniently belong<U+201D> concept. The details can be found in QGG Vol. 110, No. 253, 29 June 1918 p 1787. It can be said that this area of neglect saw no remedy until the last two decades of the twentieth century.

It is from this era that the forerunner of the present day journals came into existence, and full copies of the QPOA Journal, Echo from Volume 1, No. 1, 16 November 1914, then renamed The Professional Officer from Volume 11 No. 3 March 23 1923 are held at the Union office. In addition, August 1917 saw the inaugural issue of the QPSGOA journal, The State Service and the holdings are continuous to the present day.

It is beyond the scope of a paper of this nature to examine the impact of the notions of De Leon and Hayward in terms of Anarcho/Syndicalism upon the reasoning of union activists in the civil service of the time, but it can be stated that there was talk of a <U+201C>Grand Council of the State Public Services of Australia and New Zealand Unions<U+201D>, there was a proposal to create a Federation of the QPSGOA, the QPOA, the QTU and the Queensland Rail Association, as well as irregular but frequent moves to merge QPSGOA (renamed Queensland State Service Union of Employees, QSSU) in 1924, with QPOA but all to no avail.

A reading of the material of any one of the organisations reveals they held themselves to be paragons of virtue, willing to forgo their own demands in the desire to create a Unity, and their opinion of other unions was that they were masters of duplicity and intrigue. A reading of the records of the next body reveals they were the initiators of unification and their fellow players were sabotaging the process.

Hindsight is wonderful, but in the immortal words of Gray <U+2013> <U+201C>Some kindred spirit may inquire thy fate<U+201D>.

Nevertheless, the Australian Public Services Federation (APSF) was created circa 1918, and during the 1920s the QSSU and QPOA affiliated with the QCE of the Labor Party and also with the Trades and Labour Council, Queensland (TLCQ). Tom Bolger became QSSU General Secretary in 1921, a position he held until his death in late 1957.

Membership of the organisations grew, and the insertion of preference clauses in Awards and then compulsion to join Unions fuelled this growth.

May 1929 saw the election of <U+201C>Odd Man In<U+201D> non-Labor Premier A.E. Moore. Preference for Civil Service Unionists was abolished, an application to the Industrial Commission resulted in salary cuts, and the State Government further reduced remuneration levels by administrative fiat. The Government forced the Unions to sever ties with the State Branch of the ALP and also with TLCQ. The Government placed severe restrictions on the activities of QSSU President W.J.Copely and Senior Vice President F.M.J. Baker, and their protests brought compulsory transfer to Mackay and to Cloncurry, respectively; both resigned and both went on to parliamentary careers for Labor.

The election of Saturday 11 June 1932 brought the Labor Government of FORGAN-SMITH to power; compulsory unionism was re-introduced, wage levels gradually were restored, the 44 hour week was obtained, fortnightly rather than monthly pays were instituted, and affiliation with political and industrial organisations was again permitted. Attempts again to decentralise the QSSU and QPOA failed, and a further effort to create a <U+201C>Central Council of Queensland Public Service Unions<U+201D> foundered on the narrowness of the guild like reasoning of the individual constituents. It can be said that some opposition to the prescription that females upon marriage were obliged to resign the service arose during this period, but the time had not yet arrived to bring the change. 

Not only are unions in politics, but there are politics in unions; political ideology, and Christianity were to have a profound effect on the history of the QSSU and QPOA.

Since its inception in the 1920s, the Australian Communist Party (ACP) can be characterised as a middle class debating society, and, whilst they no doubt hoped for the <U+201C>Revolution<U+201D>, there was no organised scheme to bring it about. The ACP General Secretary, Lance Sharkey, returned from a 1930s overseas visit, and the plan adopted was to <U+201C>Bore from Within<U+201D>. <U+201C>Power Without Glory<U+201D> can be seen as an element, because, whilst there can be no criticism of it as a novel, Hardy, as a communist, sought also to discredit the ALP as corrupt, in part of the effort of the ACP to replace it as the legitimate spokesperson for the Australian working class. Aligned with this is the most remarkable report in the journal Professional Officer Vol. xxvii No. 4 April 1940 when the Vice-President, Thomas F. Hughes resigned from that position and from the POA. IT is recorded that <U+201C>Hughes said that (POA General Secretary Henry Bond) had identified himself with the PROTESTANT LABOUR (sic) PARTY, and thus Roman Catholics could not expect to get a fair deal as members of the POA.<U+201D> Hughes subsequently became President of the QSSU.

A this distance, there is greater clarity, but it can be said that some contemporaneous awareness was alive, as the April 1947 issue of State Service Journal carried an article entitled <U+201C>Communist Party and Trade Unions<U+201D>.

It cannot be gainsaid, that even the Pope gets elected on numbers, and, (dare it be said) when a motion is carried, to burn the ballot papers. Insofar as the QSSU is concerned, the motions to disaffiliate from the ALP and TLCQ came in 1957, and Council meeting attendances for that year illustrate the point:

It can be seen when the disaffiliation motion came on.

Whilst the TLC in its own right has no standing in the Queensland Industrial Tribunal as it is not an industrial organisation, that body, on behalf of a registered union generally prosecuted Common Rule claims; with disaffiliation, this left the QSSU and others without a vehicle to participate in such proceedings. This led in 1961 to the formation of an unregistered collective, the <U+201C>Combined Industrial Unions Committee<U+201D> (CIUC) to prosecute Common Rule claims. The constituents were QSSU; QPOA; FCU; AWU; Shop Assistants Union; QTU; QPU; RANF; and Clothing and Allied Trades; the CIUC remained in existence until the1980s, and, as time healed wounds, the drift back to Trades Hall saw it fall into desuetude.

The Nicklin Government came to power in 1957, union membership for new appointees to the Civil Service was compulsory, and membership and coverage expanded over the next quarter of a century. However the late 1950s marked a profound break from the past for the QSSU.

Tom Bolger, who had served as General Secretary from 1921 passed away on 15 November 1957, and he was replaced by Pat Bredhauer. In addition, Cyril Muhldorff, whose term as President commenced on 5 July 1932, stood down on 30 June 1958, and his replacement was (former QPOA member) Tom Hughes. But, in addition, younger men, born not in the nineteenth but in the twentieth century, came to Executive and to Council, and with newer ideas and progressive bent, instituted a series of reforms and developments heretofore unthought of.

* Co-operative Housing Societies were conceived and put in place;
* A Credit Union was formed, and it would be remiss not to mention in this regard the efforts (amongst many) of Leo Barcham and Brian Merrin, who founded this entity with the princely sum of <U+20A4>25/13/6 ($51.36);
* The State Service Club was opened;
* A cafeteria and a co-operative shop were brought into existence;
* A <U+2018>Females<U+2019> section of the Union was formed in March 1962.
Industrial gains proceeded apace:
*Females no longer required to resign upon marriage;
*Four weeks annual leave and annual leave loading attained;
*Five weeks annual leave for officers in remote districts;
*Creation of Combined Public Service Unions<U+2019> Superannuation Committee;
*Variable working hours (flexitime) introduced;
*Accouchement leave granted;
*The Consortium (now Union Shopper) created
*1981 saw the affiliation of QSSU with Public Service International Organisation;
*1983 <U+2013> first Regional Branch with resident Industrial Officer opened in Townsville.

This may be an appropriate juncture to provide a resum<U+00E9> of <U+201C>ancillary<U+201D> activities, drawn principally from the QSSU records. In a brief, descriptive survey of the nature, hopefully, the mere titles of the sub-organisations will suffice to demonstrate the breadth of activity:-
*Public Service Returned Sailors<U+2019> and Soldiers<U+2019> League;
*Railway (discount) ticket scheme;
*Bursaries for school pupils who were children of members;
*Union disaster scheme (for members in distress);
*Union mortality benefit;
*Workers<U+2019> Education Association;
*Public Service Horticultural Society;
*Public service church services;
*Public service lawn bowls and indoor bowls;
*Public service retired officers<U+2019> club;
*Esk picnic race day;
*Miss Queensland public service and attendant charity fundraising;
*Public service rugby football league;
*<U+201C>Touch<U+201D> rugby football league;
*Public service golf and associates golf fixtures;
*Public service debating association;
*Public service tennis and table tennis associations;
*Public service cricket club;
*State service Annual Ball/Public service <U+201C>Social Club and Younger Set<U+201D>;
*Public service rifle club;
*Public service darts club.

It scarcely needs to be said that activities of the nature of those listed simply do not just happen; members, individually and collectively have contributed immeasurable hours of voluntary labour, and, it can be said, have discharged a community responsibility in a most commendable fashion.

Political events were to have a profound impact on QSSU and QPOA in the final two decades of the twentieth century. The November 1983 election saw the National Party government of Bjelke-Petersen returned <U+2013> but, with the defection to his party of two erstwhile Liberal Party members, Don Lane and Brian Austin, the Coalition was dissolved, and allowed the Premier to govern in his own right.

Compulsion is anathema. And the price paid for compulsory union membership in the Queensland Public Service was soon revealed, upon its abolition in November 1983. These figures are taken from QSSU records:-

The challenge was met out of necessity. Through the activities of QSSU President Barry Dittmer and QPOA President Bill Higham an interim transitional organisation, THE QUEENSLAND PUBLIC SECTOR ALLIANCE was formed in 1989, which led to the 1992 ballot, which in turn approved the merger (after a separation of nine decades) between the QSSU and QPOA, to create in 1993 the STATE PUBLIC SERVICES FEDERATION and this became more recently the QUEENSLAND PUBLIC SECTOR UNION.

Developments of note during the 1990s include the arrival of the first female president (the late) Patricia COUSAR (n<U+00E9>e Gordon), the establishment of Regional Offices in various Queensland centres, the shift from appointment of senior paid staff to elections and the discovery of the wealth of talent and ability in the rank and file membership, a resource untapped in the previous one hundred years. In addition, the change from <U+201C>Common Rule<U+201D> decisions to <U+201C>Enterprise Bargaining Agreements<U+201D> has driven a shift of emphasis from the core of the organisation, to the periphery.

Despite the fact that there has been severe rifts in and between various Queensland public service white collar unions, and despite the fact that there have been profound ideological, political and policy differences between the actors at various stages, it cannot be gainsaid that their efforts have secured a better industrial life for the members. It can be concluded, that the life of the stream of participants would have been all the poorer, for their absence.
