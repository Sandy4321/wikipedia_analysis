'''Alexander Chizhevsky''' (born Aleksandr Leonidovich Tchijevsky, and also known as Aleksandr Chizhevskii, and the phonetic, Aleksandr Chizevsky), 7th February 1897 (Gregorian Calendar) (being January 26 in the Julian Calendar)<U+2013>20th December 1964 (Gregorian Calendar) (<U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440> <U+041B><U+0435><U+043E><U+043D><U+0438><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0427><U+0438><U+0436><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439>) was a [[Belarusians|Belorussian]] interdisciplinary scientist variously described as physiologist, biophysicist, cycles researcher, and founder of heliobiology, [[astrobiology]], [[historiometry]], heliotaraxy (heliotaraxia) and aero-ionification. He is most famous for realizing the link between the 11 year solar cycles, Earth<U+2019>s climate and the mass movement of peoples. <ref>Source: listing for Alexander Chizhevsky by L. V.

==Background==
An expert in heliophysics, biophysics, space biology, space medicine, cosmic sociology, aerobiology, cosmobiology, geobiology, biometerology and cosmogony, through study of the impact of cosmic physical factors on processes in living nature, Chizhevsky found a relationship between solar activity cycles and many phenomena in the biosphere. Many associations of this type were known before him and he had used a series of such correlations in his works. But he was the first scientist to reveal the link between solar cycles and the mass movement of peoples, apart from his pioneer work in heliobiology, air-ionisation and other fields, which also related to this phenomenon. He demonstrated that the physical fields of the Earth and its surroundings, should be taken into account as being among the main causes influencing the state of the biosphere. He claimed variations of solar activity and dependent geomagnetic oscillations have impact on human mental life. Chizhevsky proposed that human history is shaped by the 11 year peaks in the sun<U+2019>s activity and he claimed changes in the minds of the mass population, are triggered by solar magnetism (geomagnetic storms) manifesting in power shortages, plane crashes, epidemics, grasshopper infestations, upheavals, revolts, civil wars, revolutions and other forms of power in society, from below. He also discovered the spatial organisation of structural elements of moving blood. <ref>Source: listing for Alexander Chizhevsky by L. V.

==Biography==

===Early years===
*'''1897''' Chizhevsky was born in the town of Tsekhanovets/Tschanovets, in the Grando region of the Soviet Union (now Poland) on 26th January (old style Julian calendar) or 7th February (Gregorian calendar). His grandfather was called Peter Chiezevsky (18th century), father was called Leonid Vasilievich (1861-1929) and mother was called Nadezhda Alexandrovna (1875-1898). Chizevsky was the son of a Russian general and spent his early years in [[Kaluga]] where his memorial museum is housed.
*'''1906''' His family moved to Bela, a town in the Sedletsky region of the Soviet Union.
*'''1913''' He entered the private modern school of F. Shakhmagonov.
*'''1913''' He moved to Kaluga.
*'''1914''' Germany declares war on Russia.
*'''1914-15''' He met his future scientific collaborator, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who was also his teacher.
*'''1915''' He finished school and spent his summer observing the sun. He noted and later proved that periodical changes in solar activity are important for the organic world. This was a revolutionary hypothesis for the period. He then entered the Institute of Commerce.
*'''1916''' He joined the war, fighing on the Galician front. He gained a St George's Cross.
*'''1917''' He graduated from the Moscow Archaeological Institute.
*'''1917-23''' He lectured on the History of Science in the Ancient World, and the History of Archaeological Discovery. He attended physics and matematics Lectures. He joined the Nature Research Society, Kaluga.
*'''1917-27''' He taught a course in physical methods in Archaeology at Moscow University & Moscow Archaeological Institute.

===Middle years===
*'''1918''' He graduated from Moscow Commercial Institute. He gained the title Educated Archaeologist. He was made a member of the Moscow Institute. He began researching Earth-Sun connection mechanisms, and air ionisation, spending his career at various research institutions in Moscow, centered on the study of biological effects of the sun and cosmos. He performed research on the influence of [[ionized air]] on animals. 
*'''1918''' In May, he defended the thesis of his Ph.D <U+201C>On the periodicity of the world-historical process<U+201D> at the Moscow State University.
*'''1919''' He created a home laboratory and presented his report to the Kalgua Nature Research Society. He worked at the Lazarev Biophysical Research Institute. Svante Arrhenius (Nobel Prize Winner) invited Chizhevsky to work for him. He worked for the Ministry of Education in the Literature Department.
*'''1919-22''' He studied at the Medical Department of Moscow University.
*'''1919-30''' He was the first to establish experimentally, an opposed physiological action of negative and positive ions in the air on living organisms, and the degree of pathology induced by ionised air, and the stimulant effect on living organisms of negative aero-ions.
*'''1922-24''' He worked as a temporary consultant at the Institute of Biological Physics at the Ministry of Health.
*'''1923-26''' He worked at the Duorv Zoo-Psychology Laboratory where he was the chief expert in biology and medicine. He became a member of the Technical Council of Inventors Association.

*'''1930-36''' He was the first to establish experimentally, the fact of applied artificial aero-ionisation in medicine, agriculture and animal husbandry.
*'''1931''' He set up the Central Research Laboratory for Ionisation. The importance of Chizhevsky<U+2019>s work on aero-ionification was recognised by a Resolution of the Council of People<U+2019>s Commissars of USSR. He received support from the Soviet government. He worked as a Director of Central Research Laboratory. He published articles on Ionisation.
*'''1935''' He discovered the metachromasy of bacteria - the so-called <U+201C>Chizhevskii-Velkhover effect<U+201D> <U+2013> enabling solar emissions that were hazardous to man both on Earth and in space, to be forecast.
*'''1937''' He organises 2 aero-ionisation laboratories at the Palace of Soviet Buildings.
*'''1937-42''' He was in charge of two laboratories under the Construction Administration of the Palace of Soviets Council of People<U+2019>s Commissars of the USSR.
*'''1939''' He became an Honorary President of the International Congress of Biological Physics & Space Biology, USA.
*'''1942''' Stalin was aware of Chizhevsky<U+2019>s research works and he was asked to retract his solar writings but he refused. He was arrested on account of his solar writings and spent 8 years in a Stalin gulag in Ural, along with millions of others including thousands of scientists. He was persecuted for his <U+2018><U+2019>Physical Factors Of The Historical Process<U+2019><U+2019> and this is why he stopped his publications on this subject. However, his manuscript <U+2018><U+2019>The Earth In The Embrace Of The Sun<U+2019><U+2019> (700 pages) was published in full in the <U+201C>The Cosmic Pulse of Life<U+201D> in 1995.

===Later years===
*'''1950''' He was released from the gulag and resettled in Karaganda in Kazakhstan where he underwent 8 years rehabilitation.
*'''1958''' He conducted science work in coal mines of Karaganda. He later returned to Moscow. He introduced aero-ionic therapy into some medical establishments. He researched on air ionization and air conditioning. He became a scientific consultant and head of Sojuzanteknika.
*'''1958-62''' He ran an aero-ionification laboratory under the USSR State Planning Organisation.
*'''1964''' He died on 20th December (Gregorian calendar), in Moscow at 8 o<U+2019>clock (local time). 

===Tribute years===
*'''1965''' The Soviet Academy of Sciences formed a Special Commission to research his archives.
*'''1978''' Chizhevsky appears in the Large Soviet Encyclopedia, (Bol<U+2019>shaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya) [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/307686/Bolshaya-Sovetskaya-Entsiklopediya-as-discussed-in-encyclopaedia-reference-work] published in Moscow, with a listing by L. V. Golovanov an a portrait on page 187. Golovanov later became the author of a 25 page preface to Chizhevsky<U+2019>s book <U+201C>The Cosmic Pulse of Life<U+201D>.
*'''1982''' Edward Ayesu, of the Smithsonian Institution writes about Chizhevsky in the book <U+201C>The Rhythms Of Life<U+201D>: <U+201C>A. L. Chizhevsky, a Russian Scientist, studied many such cycles, and found a corresponding cycle in the mass movements of people. In the year or two before peak sunspot numbers occur, people are excitable, nations are aroused to their greatest achievements, and revolutions, strikes and wars occur.<U+201D>
*'''1998''' Elena Titova in a press release from the Novosti Russian News Agency wrote: <U+201C>Chizhevsky used tremendous factual material to show and prove that the life of the biosphere and the social rhythms are directly linked with the sun<U+2019>s rhythms. He believed that many things on Earth depend upon the 11 year cycle of the Sun<U+2019>s activity. Everything indicated he would become the USSR<U+2019>s first Nobel Prize winner. However, in Russia, his theory was branded as heresy, as a kind of pagan-type religion of sun-worshippers. Chizhevsky<U+2019>s laboratory was closed down, and he himself was sentenced to 16 years in Stalinist labour camps.<U+201D> 10 years later, Novosti published a further article about Russian space pioneers which was recorded at The Space Daily by Yury Zaitsev <ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/The_Discovered_Space_999.html The Discovered Space at Space Daily</ref>*
*'''1999''' The international seminar <U+2018><U+2019>Cosmos, Ecology & Noosphere<U+2019><U+2019> was held on 4th-9th October 1999 in Partenit, Crimea in Ukraine, for those working in fields connected with Chizhevsky<U+2019>s ideas.Topics included: Cosmological Influences Upon The Social Processes (Phenomenology, Biophysical & Psychophysical Mechanisms, Cycles); Ideas Of Cosmos In The Literature & Arts; Physical, Chemical, Biological & Medical Aspects Of The Effects Of Micro-Low Level Doses; Informational-Medicine; Global Ecology & Ecological Physics; Ecological Education & Noospheric Worldview.

===21st century===
*'''2000''' The paper ''Geophysical, Archaeological & Historical Evidence Supports A Solar Model For Climate Change'' was published by Professor [[Kenneth J. Hsu]] and Dr. Charles A. Perry (United States Geological Survey), in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), 2000, Volume 97, pages 12433-438. <ref>http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.short Geophysical Evidence Supports A Solar Model - PNAS Paper</ref>[http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.short PNAS Short version][http://www.pnas.org/content/97/23/12433.full.pdf PNAS Long version][http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=18780 Pub Med ASCII version]
*'''2001''' Chizhesvky was documeted in Orbit, the Journal of the Astro Space Society.
*'''2005''' At the 6th Crimean Conference on Heliobiology, called <U+2018><U+2019>Cosmos & Biosphere<U+2019><U+2019> (a conference held every 2 years, Chizhevsky<U+2019>s work was discussed. <ref>http://www.cifa-icef.org/news39.pdf Helibiology Conference News</ref>
*'''2005''' An important summary of evidence is published at <U+2018>Solar Varation<U+2019> in Wikipedia (English) [[solar variation]] Topics include Climate Change, Solar Phenomena and Climate Forcing Agents, however Chizhevsky is not mentioned.
*'''2000s''' Despite being sent to a gulag, which the state later regretted, the Chizhevsky Science Centre was opened, but housed within the Tsiolkovsky Museum, Kaluga Russia. [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (1857-1935), the pioneer of the study of rocket travel, space research and space flight, regarded as one of Russia<U+2019>s greatest scientist, lived in Kaluga. Chizhevsky was a younger friend of Tsiolkovsky. This gave Chizhevsky a broad cosmic view in his research which has influenced the Russian scientific outlook to this day.
*'''2000s''' Sergey Smelyakov opened the English website Astrotheos <ref>http://www.astrotheos.com/ Astrotheos</ref> documenting the work on solar-earth changes by Chizhevsky, providing a valuable resource for the understanding of Chizhevsky<U+2019>s work since none of Chizhevsky<U+2019>s books are available in English. Smelyakov noted that the PNAS paper by [[Kenneth Hsu]] & Charles Perry mentions that <U+201C>Reported cycles in various climate-proxy data show a tendency to emulate a fundamental harmonic sequence of a basic solar-cycle length (11 years) multiplied by 2N (where N equals a positive or negative integer)<U+201D> and the fundamental harmonic sequence of the basic solar-cycle length which they describe is close to the Auric Time Scale of the Golden Section powers idea of Chizhevsky, being 1.618**N, which Smelyakov considered more at the Astrotheos Official Site. The claim forecast has been further corroborated by Russian scientists such as [[Khabibullo Abdusamatov]] <ref>http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080103/94768732.html Cold Spell To Replace Global Warming</ref> who speak of a cold spell 2012-2041, American & British scientists such as [[Yuk Yung]], [[John D. Hamaker]] [http://www.remineralize.org] and John Cassey <ref>http://www.spaceandscience.net S&SR Center Official Site</ref>, [[Nigel Calder]] and Danish scientists such as [[Henrik Svensmark]] in his book ''The Chilling Stars''.
*'''2008''' Yury Zaitsev, writing for Novosti, chronicled Chizhevsky's contribution to current understanding of solar cycles in ''New Cycle of Solar Activity'' published at Rian.Ru. <ref>http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080207/98679186.html Rian Article on Solar Activity</ref>

==Sunspots and War==

He analyzed sunspot records and proxies as well as battles, revolutions, riots and wars in Russia and 71 other countries for the period 500 BCE to 1922 CE. He found that 80% of the most significant events occurred around sunspot maximum. This data was also reported and further analyzed by Raymond Wheeler and Edward R. Dewey in America, and Dewey reported various cycles in the battles index including 11 and 22 years, both related to sunspot activity. He noted that the Russian Revolution of 1917 occurred during a sunspot activity peak and as a result spent long years in Soviet prisons (Gulag) because his theory challenged the communist belief system. He considered that solar activity triggered existing grievances and complaints rather than causing them.

:"Life is a phenomenon. Its production is due to the influence of the dynamics of the cosmos on a passive subject. It lives due to dynamics, each oscillation of organic pulsation is coordinated with the cosmic heart in a grandiose whole of nebulas, stars, the sun and the planet."
- Alexander L Chizhevsky

==Continuation of Chizhevsky's work==

Chizhevsky's work was published in Russian and French and has generally not been translated into English and so his work has been little known in the English speaking world. Much of his research was ahead of its time and it has taken decades for other researchers, using space weather research and the like, to reach similar conclusions to his. Even now, the extent of cosmic effects on biological systems is much more accepted in Russia than in the west.

Prof. S Ertel, who has made insightful studies of contentious scientific research writes "Soon I found myself looking, with due sense of duty, at unconventional claims of disrespected authors. Is there anything at Alexander Chizhevsky's claim that variations of solar activity and dependent geomagnetic oscillations have any impact on human mental life? Is there any evidence of his claim that changes of minds among masses of people are triggered by solar magnetism manifesting themselves as upheavals, revolts, civil wars, revolutions, and other forms of 'power from below'?". His conclusion was "To my surprise, however, my scrutiny of this hypothesis based on own data corroborated the gist of his results. Fortunately, representatives of mainstream science in the West where tolerance is decreed by law could not simply react to this finding by jailing the researcher". 

In 1996 a cycles conference attended by some 500 researchers was held in [[Stavropol]] in Russia to honour the centenary of Chizhevsky's birth. With the collapse of communism it was finally acceptable to say that cosmic influences, and not just the struggle of the working class, affected human [[Behavior|behaviour]] and revolution.
