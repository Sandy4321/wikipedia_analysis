'''''Virtual Pool 3''''' is a 3D virtual [[Cue sports|billiards]] computer [[simulation game]] developed and released for the [[Personal computer|PC]] by [[Celeris Inc|Celeris]]. It is the most recent game for the [[Personal computer|PC]] in the [[Media franchise|franchise]] of [[Virtual Pool]] games and it is widely respected by fans as the most accurate computer [[simulation]] of billiards available.

<blockquote>"You can't find a pool sim that looks and plays as much like the real thing as Virtual Pool 3 does. If your real-life play doesn't show any advances after you spend some time with this outstanding pool simulation, you're left with only two possibilities - you're so good that there's no way you can get better, or you don't have any arms." &mdash; GameSpot<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/sports/virtualpool3/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review|title=Virtual Pool 3 - GameSpot full review}}</ref></blockquote>

==Overview==
The [[Virtual Pool|Virtual Pool series]] made its debut in December of 1996 with the release of Virtual Pool. From there, [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] went on to release Virtual Pool 2 in [[November]] of 1997, adding a wealth of improvements including enhanced physics modelling and a handful of new game types. Virtual Pool Hall soon followed in December of 1999, bringing with it the introduction of [[snooker]] to the series. It wasn't a perfect break though, as Virtual Pool Hall suffered from poor opponent [[AI]] and a lack of a [[pool hall]] atmosphere, ironic considering its name. With Virtual Pool 3 however, the fourth installment in the series, [[Celeris]] is lurking closer and closer to the perfect game of [[pool (game)|pool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.game-over.com/reviews/pc/Virtual_Pool_3.html|title=Virtual Pool 3 - Game Over review}}</ref></blockquote> Initially, Virtual Pool 3 was released as a retail boxed version endorsed by [[Jeanette Lee (pool player)|Jeanette Lee]], the successful [[Korean-American]] professional pool player. Currently the latest version is available on the Celeris site as a [[download]] and is still supported via downloadable [[Patch (computing)|patches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celeris.com/games/vp3/patch|title=Virtual Pool 3 - Downloadable patches}}</ref>

The game is an active [[Internet]] pastime for many amateur billiards enthusiasts all over the world (most notably from the [[United States|USA]] and [[Europe]]), with a small but dedicated following, many of whom have been playing the game for years.

==Gameplay==

The game can be played in single-player mode against the computer (Career Mode, Tournament or Quick Play), or against other human opponents on the Internet or locally through a [[LAN]].

The game features eight [[Pool hall|billiard venues]] the player can choose from, which include six pool tables, a snooker table, and a [[Carom billiards|carom]] table for [[cushion caroms]] or [[three-cushion billiards]]. There are three preset table configurations available for all games (Championship, Professional or Amateur), but any table can be customized for roll speed and pocket dimensions.

Twenty-one variations are featured in the game, and while most players stick to [[Pocket billiards|pool]] favorites such as [[nine-ball]], [[eight-ball]] and [[straight pool]], as well as [[snooker]], the inclusion of less common variations such as [[cowboy pool]], [[honolulu (billiards)|honolulu]] and [[bowliards]] may be of interest to some, especially since finding real-life players of them can be difficult.
