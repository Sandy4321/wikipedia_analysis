'''Frogs''' are [[amphibian]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Anura]] (meaning "tail-less", from Greek ''an-,'' without + ''oura'', tail), formerly referred to as ''Salientia'' (Latin ''salere'' (''salio''), "to jump"). Most frogs are characterized by long hind legs, a short body, webbed digits (fingers or toes), protruding [[eye]]s and the absence of a [[tail]].  Frogs are widely known as exceptional jumpers, and many of the anatomical characteristics of frogs, particularly their long, powerful legs, are adaptations to improve jumping performance.  Due to their permeable skin, frogs are often semi-aquatic or inhabit humid areas, but move easily on land. They typically lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in puddles, [[pond]]s or [[lake]]s, and their [[larva]]e, called [[tadpole]]s, have [[gill]]s and develop in [[water]]. Adult frogs follow a [[carnivore|carnivorous]] diet, mostly of [[arthropod]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[gastropoda|gastropods]]. Frogs are most noticeable by their call, which can be widely heard during the night or day, mainly in their [[Estrous cycle|mating season]]..

The distribution of frogs ranges from [[tropics|tropic]] to [[subarctic]] regions, but most species are found in [[tropical rainforest]]s. Consisting of more than 5,000 species described, they are among the most diverse groups of [[vertebrate]]s. However, populations of certain frog species are [[decline in amphibian populations|declining]] significantly.

A distinction is often made between frogs and [[toad]]s on the basis of their appearance, caused by the [[convergent evolution|convergent adaptation]] among so-called toads to dry environments; however, this distinction has no taxonomic basis. The only family exclusively given the common name "toad" is [[Bufonidae]], but many species from other families are also called "toads," and the species within the toad genus ''[[Atelopus]]'' are referred to as "harlequin frogs".

The name frog derives from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''frogga'', (compare [[Old Norse]] ''frauki'', [[German language|German]] ''Frosch'', older [[Dutch language|Dutch]] spelling ''kikvorsch''), cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''plava'' (frog), probably deriving from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''praw'' = "to jump".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehl.santafe.edu/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=config&morpho=0&basename=/data/ie/piet&first=2221|title=Indo-European etymology database}}</ref>

== Taxonomy ==
{{details|List of Anuran families}}
The order ''Anura'' contains 4,810 species<ref name="Pou92">Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.</ref> in 33 families, of which the [[Leptodactylidae]] (1100 spp.), [[Hylidae]] (800 spp.) and [[Ranidae]] (750 spp.) are the richest in species. About 88% of [[amphibian]] species are frogs.
[[File:Bombina bombina 1 (Marek Szczepanek) tight crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[European Fire-bellied Toad]] (''Bombina&nbsp;bombina'')]]
The use of the common names "frog" and "toad" has no taxonomic justification. From a taxonomic perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are considered "true toads". The use of the term "frog" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic with smooth and/or moist skins, and the term "toad" generally refers to species that tend to be terrestrial with dry, warty skin. An exception is the [[fire-bellied toad]] (''Bombina bombina''): while its skin is slightly warty, it prefers a watery habitat.

Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: [[Archaeobatrachia]], which includes four families of primitive frogs; [[Mesobatrachia]], which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and [[Neobatrachia]], by far the largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of "modern" frogs, including most common species throughout the world. Neobatrachia is further divided into the Hyloidea and Ranoidea.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ford| first=L.S.| coauthors=D.C. Cannatella| year=1993| title=The major clades of frogs| journal=Herpetological Monographs| volume=7| pages=94<U+2013>117| doi=10.2307/1466954}}</ref> This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the [[pectoral girdle]], and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated. Future studies of [[molecular genetics]] should soon provide further insights to the evolutionary relationships among Anuran families.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Faivovich| first=J.| coauthors=C.F.B. Haddad, P.C.A. Garcia, D.R. Frost, J.A. Campbell, and W.C. Wheeler| title=Systematic review of the frog family Hylidae, with special reference to Hylinae: Phylogenetic analysis and revision| journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History| volume=294| pages=1<U+2013>240| doi=10.1206/0003-0090(2005)294[0001:SROTFF]2.0.CO;2| year=2005}}</ref>

Some species of anurans [[hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] readily. For instance, the [[Edible Frog]] (''Rana esculenta'') is a hybrid of the [[Pool Frog]] (''R. lessonae'') and the [[Marsh Frog]] (''R. ridibunda''). ''Bombina bombina'' and ''Bombina variegata'' similarly form hybrids, although these are less fertile, giving rise to a [[hybrid zone]].

== Morphology and physiology ==
[[File:Rana skeleton.png|thumb|upright|Skeleton of ''[[Rana (genus)|Rana]]'']]
The [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of frogs is unique among amphibians. Compared with the other two groups of amphibians, ([[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s), frogs are unusual because they lack tails as adults and their legs are more suited to jumping than walking. The physiology of frogs is generally like that of other amphibians (and differs from other terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s) because oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skin. This unique feature allows frogs to "breathe" largely through their skin.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Because the oxygen is dissolved in an aqueous film on the skin and passes from there to the blood, the skin must remain moist at all times; this makes frogs susceptible to many toxins in the environment, some of which can similarly dissolve in the layer of water and be passed into their bloodstream. This may be the cause of the [[decline in amphibian populations|decline in frog populations]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The complexity of deformed amphibians|author=Blaustein, Andrew R & Pieter TJ Johnson|journal=Front.

Many characteristics are not shared by all of the approximately 5,250 described frog species. However, some general characteristics distinguish them from other amphibians. Frogs are usually well suited to jumping, with long hind legs and elongated ankle bones. They have a short vertebral column, with no more than ten free vertebrae, followed by a fused tailbone (urostyle or [[coccyx]]), typically resulting in a tailless phenotype.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Frogs range in size from {{convert|10|mm|abbr=on}} (''[[Brachycephalus didactylus]]'' of [[Brazil]] and ''[[Eleutherodactylus iberia]]'' of [[Cuba]]) to {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} ([[goliath frog]], ''Conraua goliath'', of [[Cameroon]]). The skin hangs loosely on the body because of the lack of [[loose connective tissue]]. Skin texture varies: it can be smooth, warty or folded. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. Frogs have a [[tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]] on each side of the head, which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. Most frogs have teeth, specifically 'pedicellate teeth' in which the crow is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. Most only have teeth on the edge of the upper jaw (''maxillary teeth'') as well as ''vomerine teeth'' on the roof of their mouth. They do not have any teeth on their lower jaw, so they usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to hold the prey and keep it in place till they can get a good grip on it and swallow their meal, assisted by retracting their eyes into their head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/207/8/1361 |title=Contribution of eye retraction to swallowing performance in the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens - Levine et al. 207 (8): 1361 - Journal of Experimental Biology |doi=10.1242/jeb.00885 |publisher=Jeb.biologists.org |date=2004-03-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref>  [[Bufonidae|true toads]] lack any teeth at all, and some species ([[Pyxicephalus]]) which prey on relatively large organisms (including mice and other frogs) have cone shaped projections of bone, called odontoid processes, at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.<ref name="Pou92">Pough ''et al.'' 1992.

=== Feet and legs ===
[[File:Litoria tyleri.jpg|thumb|[[Tyler's Tree Frog]] (''Litoria tyleri'') illustrates large toe pads and webbed feet]]

[[Image:Frog_limbs.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bullfrog]] skeleton, showing elongate limb bones and extra joints.  Red marks indicate bones which have been substantially elongated in frogs and joints which have become mobile.  Blue indicates joints and bones which have not been modified or only somewhat elongated.]]
The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees, or in burrows. Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them do so.

Many frogs, especially those that live in water, have webbed toes. The degree to which the toes are webbed is directly proportional to the amount of time the species lives in the water. For example, the completely aquatic [[African dwarf frog]] (''Hymenochirus sp.'') has fully webbed toes, whereas the toes of [[White's tree frog]] (''Litoria caerulea''), an arboreal species, are only a half or a quarter webbed.

[[Tree frog|Arboreal frogs]] have "toe pads" to help grip vertical surfaces. These pads, located on the ends of the toes, do not work by suction. Rather, the surface of the pad consists of interlocking cells, with a small gap between adjacent cells. When the frog applies pressure to the toe pads, the interlocking cells grip irregularities on the substrate. The small gaps between the cells drain away all but a thin layer of moisture on the pad, and maintain a grip through [[capillarity]]. This allows the frog to grip smooth surfaces, and does not function when the pads are excessively wet.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Emerson| first=S.B.| coauthors=Diehl, D.| year=1980| title=Toe pad morphology and mechanisms of sticking in frogs| journal=Biol. J. Linn. Soc.| volume=13| issue=3| pages=199<U+2013>216| doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1980.tb00082.x}}</ref>

In many arboreal frogs, a small "intercalary structure" in each toe increases the surface area touching the substrate. Furthermore, since hopping through trees can be dangerous, many arboreal frogs have hip joints that allow both hopping and walking. Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes, as do aquatic frogs. In these arboreal frogs, the webs allow the frogs to "parachute" or control their glide from one position in the canopy to another.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=M. B| coauthors=A. J. Pemberton, and E. N. Smith| year=2002| title=New and poorly known parachuting frogs (Rhacophoridae : ''Rhacophorus'') from Sumatra and Java| journal=Herpetological Monographs| volume=16| pages=46<U+2013>92| doi=10.1655/0733-1347(2002)016[0046:NAPKPF]2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

Ground-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs have a toe extension<U+2014>a [[metatarsal]] [[tubercle]]<U+2014>that helps them to burrow. The hind legs of ground dwellers are more muscular than those of aqueous and tree-dwelling frogs.

Sometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the animal's rear leg stubs is eaten by a [[dragonfly nymph]]. In some of these cases, the full leg grows anyway, and in other cases, it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three legs. Other times, a parasitic [[flatworm]] called ''Riberoria trematodes'' digs into the rear of a tadpole, where it rearranges the limb bud cells, which sometimes causes the frog to have extra legs.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8116000/8116692.stm Legless frogs mystery solved], BBC, June 25, 2009</ref>

=== Jumping ===
Frogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers, and the best jumper of all vertebrates. The Australian rocket frog, ''[[Litoria nasuta]]'', can leap over 50 times its body length (5.5&nbsp;cm), resulting in jumps of over 2 meters. The acceleration of the jump may be up to twice gravity. There are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability, but within a species, jump distance increases with increasing size, but relative jumping distance (body-lengths jumped) decreases.

While frog species can use a variety of locomotor modes ([[running]], [[walking]], [[gliding]], [[aquatic locomotion|swimming]], and [[climbing]]), more are either proficient at [[jumping]] or descended from ancestors who were, with much of the [[musculo-skeletal]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] modified for this purpose. The [[tibia]], [[fibula]] and [[tarsals]] have been fused into a single, strong [[bone]], as have the radius and ulna in the [[forelimb]]s (which must absorb the impact of landing). The [[metatarsals]] have become elongated to add to the [[leg]] length and allow the frog to push against the ground for longer during a [[jump]]. The [[illium]] has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the [[sacrum]] which, in specialist jumpers such as [[Ranidae|Ranids]] or [[Hylidae|Hylids]], functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. This elongation of the limbs results in the frog being able to apply force to the ground for longer during a jump, which in turn results in a longer, faster jump.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

The muscular system has been similarly modified. The hind limbs of the ancestor of frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the muscles involved in jumping accounting for over 17% of the total mass of the frog.

In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the [[cuban tree frog]], the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed what muscle is capable of producing. Currently, it is hypothesized that frogs are storing muscular energy by stretching their tendons like springs, then triggering the release all at once, allowing the frog to increase the energy of its jump beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has already been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advan.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/29/1/21#R13 |title=The locust jump: an integrated laboratory investigation - Scott 29 (1): 21 - Advances in Physiology Education |doi=10.1152/advan.00037.2004 |publisher=Advan.physiology.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref>

=== Skin ===
[[File:Hip-pocket Frog - Assa darlingtoni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pouched Frog]] (''Assa darlingtoni'') camouflaged against leaf litter.]]
[[Image:Frogskin100x.jpg|thumb|right|Microscopic view of frog skin]]

Many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area. However, the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Some tree frogs reduce water loss with a waterproof layer of skin. Others have adapted behaviours to conserve water, including engaging in [[nocturnal]] activity and resting in a water-conserving position. This position involves the frog lying with its toes and fingers tucked under its body and chin, respectively, with no gap between the body and substrate. Some frog species will also rest in large groups, touching the skin of the neighbouring frog. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. These adaptations only reduce water loss enough for a predominantly arboreal existence, and are not suitable for arid conditions.

[[Camouflage]] is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal, which adds to their ability to hide. Nocturnal frogs usually find the ideal camouflaged position during the day to sleep. Some frogs have the
[[:Category:Animals that can change color|ability to change colour]], but this is usually restricted to shades of one or two colours. For example, White's tree frog varies in shades of green and brown. Features such as warts and [[skin fold]]s are usually found on ground-dwelling frogs, where a smooth skin would not disguise them effectively. Arboreal frogs usually have smooth skin, enabling them to disguise themselves as leaves.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.

=== Poison ===
Many frogs contain mild [[toxin]]s that make them unpalatable to potential predators. For example, all toads have large poison glands<U+2014>the [[parotoid gland]]s<U+2014>located behind the eyes, on the top of the head. Some frogs, such as some [[poison dart frog]]s, are especially toxic. The chemical makeup of toxins in frogs varies from irritants to [[hallucinogen]]s, [[seizure|convulsants]], [[neurotoxin|nerve poisons]], and [[vasoconstrictor]]s. Many predators of frogs have adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons. Others, including humans, may be severely affected.
[[File:Dendrobates pumilio.jpg|thumb|''[[Oophaga pumilio]]'', a [[poison dart frog]], contains numerous alkaloids which deter predators]]

Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Saporito| first=R.A.| coauthors= H.M. Garraffo, M.A. Donnelly, A.L. Edwards, J.T. Longino, and J.W.

It was previously a misconception the poison was placed on arrows rather than darts. The common name of these frogs was thus changed from "poison arrow frog" to "poison dart frog" in the early 1980s. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as [[aposematism]]. There are at least two non-poisonous species of frogs in tropical America (''Eleutherodactylus gaigei'' and ''Lithodytes lineatus'') that mimic the colouration of dart poison frogs' coloration for self-protection ([[Batesian mimicry]]).<ref>{{cite book| last=Savage| first=J.

Because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a "natural pharmacy". The alkaloid [[epibatidine]], a painkiller 200 times more potent than [[morphine]], is found in some species of poison dart frogs. Other chemicals isolated from the skin of frogs may offer resistance to [[HIV]] infection.<ref>{{cite journal|last=VanCompernolle| first=Scott. E.| coauthors=R. J. Taylor, K. Oswald-Richter, J.

The skin secretions of some toads, such as the [[Colorado River toad]] and [[cane toad]], contain [[bufotoxin]]s, some of which, such as [[bufotenin]], are psychoactive, and have therefore been used as recreational drugs. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and smoked. Skin licking is especially dangerous, and appears to constitute an [[urban myth]]. See [[psychoactive toad]].

=== Respiration and circulation ===
The skin of a frog is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as to water. There are a number of blood vessels near the surface of the skin. When a frog is underwater, oxygen is transmitted through the skin directly into the bloodstream. On land, adult frogs use their lungs to breathe. Their lungs are similar to those of humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and there are no [[rib]]s or [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] to support breathing. Frogs breathe by taking air in through the nostrils (which often have valves which close when the frog is submerged), causing the throat to puff out, then compressing the floor of the mouth, which forces the air into the lungs. In August 2007 an aquatic frog named ''Barbourula kalimantanensis'' was discovered in a remote part of Indonesia. The [[Bornean Flat-headed Frog]] (''B. kalimantanensis'') is the first species of frog known to science without lungs.

Frogs are known for their three-chambered [[heart]], which they share with all [[tetrapod]]s except [[bird]]s, [[crocodilia]]ns and [[mammal]]s. In the three-chambered heart, oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiring]] tissues enter by separate [[atrium (anatomy)|atria]], and are directed via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel<U+2014>[[aorta]] for oxygenated blood and [[pulmonary artery]] for deoxygenated blood. This special structure is essential to keeping the mixing of the two types of blood to a minimum, which enables frogs to have higher metabolic rates, and to be more active than otherwise.

Some species of frog have remarkable adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. The lake titicaca frog (''[[Telmatobius culeus]]'') is one such species and to survive in the poorly oxygenated waters of Lake Titicaca it has incredibly wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. This frog will also do 'push-ups' on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around its body.<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press]].</ref>

=== Digestion and excretion ===
The frog's digestive system begins with the mouth. Frogs have teeth along their upper jaw called the maxillary teeth, which are used to grind food before swallowing. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to catch or harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky tongue to catch food (such as flies or other insects). The food then moves through the esophagus into the stomach. The food then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Frogs carry pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile (produced by the liver) through the gallbladder from the liver to the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and extract the nutrients. When the food passes into the large intestine, the water is reabsorbed and wastes are routed to the [[cloaca]]. All wastes exit the body through the cloaca and the cloacal vent.

=== Nervous system ===
The frog has a highly developed nervous system which consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of the frog's brain correspond with those of humans. The [[medulla oblongata]] regulates respiration, digestion, and other automatic functions. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the [[cerebellum]]. The relative size of the [[cerebrum]] of a frog is much smaller than that of a human. Frogs have ten [[cranial nerves]] (nerves which pass information from the outside directly to the brain) and ten pairs of [[spinal nerves]] (nerves which pass information from extremities to the brain through the spinal cord). By contrast, all [[amniotes]] (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve cranial nerves. Frogs do not have external ears; the eardrums ([[tympanum (zoology)|tympanic membranes]]) are directly exposed. As in all animals, the ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation.

== Natural history ==
The life cycle of frogs, like that of other amphibians, consists of four main stages: egg, tadpole, metamorphosis and adult. The reliance of frogs on an aquatic environment for the egg and tadpole stages gives rise to a variety of breeding behaviours that include the well-known mating calls used by the males of most species to attract females to the bodies of water that they have chosen for breeding. Some frogs also look after their eggs<U+2014>and in some cases even the tadpoles<U+2014>for some time after laying.

=== Life cycle ===

[[File:Haswell's Frog - Paracrinia haswelli tadpole.jpg|thumb|Tadpole of [[Haswell's Froglet]] (''Paracrinia haswelli'']]
The life cycle of a frog starts with an egg. A female generally lays gelatinous egg masses containing thousands of eggs, in water. Each anuran species lays eggs in a distinctive, identifiable manner. An example are the long strings of eggs laid by the common American toad. The eggs are highly vulnerable to [[predation]], so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure the survival of the next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up the development. Most commonly, this involves synchronous reproduction. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid the predators and pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to retain moisture. In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Warkentin| first=K.M.| year=1995| title=Adaptive plasticity in hatching age: a response to predation risk trade-offs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=92| pages=3507<U+2013>3510| doi=10.1073/pnas.92.8.3507| pmid=}}</ref> Some species, such as the [[Cane Toad]] (''Bufo marinus''), lay poisonous eggs to minimise predation. While the length of the egg stage depends on the species and environmental conditions, aquatic eggs generally hatch within one week. Other species go through their whole larval phase inside the eggs or the mother, or they have direct development. Unlike salamanders and newts, frogs and toads never become sexually mature while still in their larval stage.

Eggs hatch and continue life as [[tadpole]]s (occasionally known as polliwogs), which typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. At least one species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has tadpoles that are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P.html|title=Ontogenetic Changes in Diet and Intestinal Morphology in Semi-Terrestrial Tadpoles of Nannophrys ceylonensis (Dicroglossidae)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&table=amphib&where-genus=Nannophrys&where-species=ceylonensis |title=Nannophrys ceylonensis - Sri Lanka rock frog |publisher=Amphibiaweb.org |date=2005-05-10 |accessdate=2009-03-06}}</ref> but as a general rule, free living larvae are fully aquatic. They lack lungs, eyelids, front and hind legs, and have a cartilaginous skeleton, a [[lateral line system]], gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later) and tails with dorsal and ventral folds of skin for swimming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-40603/Anura |title=Anura :: From tadpole to adult - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref> Some species which go through the metamorphosis inside the egg and hatch to small frogs never develop gills, instead there are specialised areas of skin that takes care of the respiration. Tadpoles also lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species usually have two elongate, parallel rows of small [[keratin]]ized structures called keradonts in the upper jaw while the lower jaw has three rows of keradonts, surrounded by a [[keratin|horny]] beak, but the number of rows can be lower or absent, or much higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/larvae |title=Larvae: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}</ref> Tadpoles are typically [[herbivore|herbivorous]], feeding mostly on [[alga]]e, including [[diatom]]s filtered from the water through the [[gill]]s. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. [[Cannibalism]] has been observed among tadpoles. Early developers who gain legs may be eaten by the others, so the late bloomers survive longer. This has been observed in England in the species ''Rana temporaria'' (common frog).<ref>[http://www.marinebiology.co.uk/frogs.htm Frogs Found in the U.K.]. Retrieved 18 July 2007.</ref>

Tadpoles are highly vulnerable to predation by fish, [[newt]]s, predatory [[diving beetle]]s and birds such as [[kingfisher]]s. Poisonous tadpoles are present in many species, such as Cane Toads. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week, or tadpoles may overwinter and metamorphose the following year in some species, such as the [[midwife toad]] (''Alytes obstetricans'') and the common spadefoot (''Pelobates fuscus''). In the [[Pipidae]], with the exception for Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels which make them resemble small [[catfish]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/lists/Pipidae.shtml |title=AmphibiaWeb - Pipidae |publisher=Amphibiaweb.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>

[[File:Green-leopard-frog-in-swamp.jpg|left|thumb|Adult [[leopard frog]]]]
With the exception of the base of the tail, where a few vertebral structures develop to give rise to the urostyle later in life, the tail lacks the completely solid, segmental, skeletal elements of cartilage or bony tissue that are so typical for other vertebrates, although it does contain a [[notochord]]

At the end of the tadpole stage, frogs undergo [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], in which they transition into adult form. Metamorphosis involves a dramatic transformation of morphology and physiology, as tadpoles develop hind legs, then front legs, lose their gills and develop lungs. Their intestines shorten as they shift from an herbivorous to a carnivorous diet. Eyes migrate rostrally and dorsally, allowing for binocular vision exhibited by the adult frog. This shift in eye position mirrors the shift from prey to predator, as the tadpole develops and depends less upon a larger and wider field of vision and more upon depth perception. The final stage of development from froglet to adult frog involves [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death) and resorption of the tail.
[[File:Cambodia_Frog_Eating_Frog.JPG|left|thumb|Incident of frog cannibalism]]
After metamorphosis, young adults may leave the water and disperse into terrestrial habitats, or continue to live in the aquatic habitat as adults. Almost all species of frogs are [[carnivore|carnivorous]] as adults, eating invertebrates such as [[arthropod]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[gastropoda|gastropods]]. A few of the larger species may eat prey such as small [[mammal]]s, [[fish]] and smaller frogs. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others capture their prey and force it into their mouths with their hands. However, there are a very few species of frogs that primarily eat plants.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Silva| first=H. R.| coauthors=Britto-Pereira M. C., & Caramaschi U.| year=1989| title=Frugivory and Seed Dispersal by ''Hyla truncata'', a Neotropical Treefrog| journal=Copeia| volume=1989(3)| pages=781<U+2013>783| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1445517}}</ref> Adult frogs are themselves preyed upon by [[bird]]s, large [[fish]], [[snake]]s, [[otter]]s, [[fox]]es, [[badger]]s, [[coati]]s, and other animals. Frogs are also eaten by people (see section on [[#Uses in agriculture and research|uses in agriculture and research]], below).

Frogs and toads can live for many years; though little is known about their life span in the wild, captive frogs and toads are recorded living up to 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Curry-Lindahl | year=1966 | title= | journal=Biegler}} see also http://www.pondturtle.com/lfrog.html#Bufo</ref>

Frogs from temperate climates hibernate through the winter, and 4 species are known to freeze during this time, most notably [[Rana sylvatica]].<ref>Storey, K. B. 1990.

American Journal of Physiology - Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology 258:559-568.</ref>

=== Reproduction of frogs ===
Once adult frogs reach maturity, they will assemble at a water source such as a pond or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water where they were born, often resulting in annual migrations involving thousands of frogs. In continental Europe, a large proportion of migrating frogs used to die on roads, before special fences and tunnels were built for them.

[[File:Bufo bufo couple during migration(2005).jpg|thumb|left|Male and female [[Common toad]] (''Bufo bufo'') in [[amplexus]]]]
[[File:Male and Female Frog in Amplexus.JPG|thumb|right|A Male and Female common toad in amplexus. The [[black]] strands are eggs released into open water minutes after birth.]]
Once at the breeding ground, male frogs call to attract a mate, collectively becoming a chorus of frogs. The call is unique to the species, and will attract females of that species. Some species have satellite males who do not call, but intercept females that are approaching a calling male.

The male and female frogs then undergo [[amplexus]]. This involves the male mounting the female and gripping her (sometimes with special [[nuptial pad]]s) tightly. Fertilization is [[external fertilization|external]]: the [[Ovum|egg]] and [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] meet outside of the body. The female releases her eggs, which the male frog covers with a sperm solution. The eggs then swell and develop a protective coating. The eggs are typically brown or black, with a clear, [[gelatin]]-like covering.

Most temperate species of frogs reproduce between late autumn and early spring. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], most common frog populations produce frogspawn in February, although there is wide variation in timing. Water temperatures at this time of year are relatively low, typically between four and 10 degrees [[Celsius]]. Reproducing in these conditions helps the developing tadpoles because dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water are highest at cold temperatures. More importantly, reproducing early in the season ensures that appropriate food is available to the developing frogs at the right time.

=== Parental care ===
[[File:Haeckel Batrachia.jpg|thumb|Colour plate from [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s 1904 ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'', depicting frog species that include two examples of parental care.]]
Although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs, it is estimated that up to 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in one way or another, and there is a great diversity of parental behaviours.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crump| first=M.L.| year=1996| title=Parental care among the Amphibia| journal=Advances in the Study of Behavior| volume=25| pages=109<U+2013>144| doi=10.1016/S0065-3454(08)60331-9}}</ref> Some species of poison dart frog lay eggs on the forest floor and protect them, guarding the eggs from predation and keeping them moist. The frog will urinate on them if they become too dry. After hatching, a parent (the sex depends upon the species) will move them, on its back, to a water-holding [[bromeliad]]. The parent then feeds them by laying unfertilized eggs in the bromeliad until the young have metamorphosed. Other frogs carry the eggs and tadpoles on their hind legs or back (e.g. the [[midwife toad]]s, ''Alytes spp.''). Some frogs even protect their offspring inside their own bodies. The male Australian [[Pouched Frog]] (''Assa darlingtoni'') has pouches along its side in which the tadpoles reside until metamorphosis. The female [[Gastric-brooding Frog]]s (genus ''Rheobatrachus'') from [[Australia]], now probably extinct, swallows its tadpoles, which then develop in the stomach. To do this, the Gastric-brooding Frog must stop secreting [[stomach acid]] and suppress [[peristalsis]] (contractions of the stomach). [[Darwin's Frog]] (''Rhinoderma darwinii'') from [[Chile]] puts the tadpoles in its vocal sac for development. Some species of frog will leave a 'babysitter' to watch over the frogspawn until it hatches.

=== Call ===
Some frog calls are so loud, they can be heard up to a mile away.<ref>See, for instance, [http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/publications/amphibians/frogs.htm Ohio's Toads and Frogs] by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Retrieved 18 July 2007.</ref> The call of a frog is unique to its species. Frogs call by passing air through the [[larynx]] in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more [[vocal sac]]s, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth that distend during the amplification of the call. The field of [[neuroethology]] studies the neurocircuitry
that underlies frog audition.

Some frogs lack vocal sacs, such as those from the genera ''Heleioporus'' and ''Neobatrachus'', but these species can still produce a loud call. Their [[mouth|buccal cavity]] is enlarged and dome-shaped, acting as a [[resonance chamber]] that amplifies their call. Species of frog without vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to flowing water. The noise of flowing water overpowers any call, so they must communicate by other means.

The main reason for calling is to allow males to attract a mate. Males call either individually or in a group called a chorus. Females of many frog species, for example ''Polypedates leucomystax'', produce calls reciprocal to the males', which act as the catalyst for the enhancement of reproductive activity in a breeding colony.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roy| first=Debjani| year=1997| title=Communication signals and sexual selection in amphibians| journal=Current Science| volume=72| pages= 923<U+2013>927}}</ref> A male frog emits a release call when mounted by another male. Tropical species also have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a rain shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to chase away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed.

A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open, resulting in a higher-pitched call. The effectiveness of the call is unknown; however, it is suspected the call intrigues the predator until another animal is attracted, distracting them enough for its escape.

Many species of frog have deep calls, or croaks. The English [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] spelling is "ribbit". The croak of the [[bullfrog|American bullfrog]] (''Rana catesbiana'') is sometimes spelt "jug o' rum".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hilton|first=Bill Jr.|title=Jug-o-Rum: Call of the Amorous Bullfrog|url=http://www.hiltonpond.org/PNBullfrog860608.html|work=The Piedmont Naturalist|publisher=Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History|volume=1|date=1986-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> Other examples are Ancient Greek ''brekekekex koax koax'' for probably ''[[Rana ridibunda]]'', and the description in [[Rigveda]] 7:103.6 ''g<U+00F3>m<U+0101>yur <U+00E9>ko aj<U+00E1>m<U+0101>yur <U+00E9>ka<U+0127>'' = "one [[has]] a voice like a cow's, one [[has]] a voice like a goat's".

Some frogs inhabit arid areas such as deserts, where water may not be easily accessible, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. The Australian genus ''[[Cyclorana]]'' and the American genus ''[[Pternohyla]]'' will bury themselves underground, create a water-impervious cocoon and [[hibernation|hibernate]] during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pond and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to most other frogs so that breeding is complete before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment; for instance the [[wood frog]], whose habitat extends north of the [[Arctic Circle]], buries itself in the ground during winter when much of its body freezes.

== Evolution ==
[[File:Fossilised frog.jpg|thumb|A fossilized frog from the [[Czech Republic]], possibly ''[[Palaeobatrachus gigas]]'']]

Until the discovery of the [[Permian|Early Permian]] ''[[Gerobatrachus hottoni]]'', a stem-batrachian with many [[salamander]]-like characteristics, the earliest known proto-frog was ''[[Triadobatrachus]] massinoti'', from the 250 million year old early [[Triassic]] of [[Madagascar]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cannatella|first=David|title=Triadobatrachus massinoti|url=http://www.tolweb.org/Triadobatrachus_massinoti/16962|work=Tree of Life|date=1995|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> The skull is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern amphibia. These include a different [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], a longer body with more [[vertebrae]], and separate vertebrae in its tail (whereas in modern frogs, the tail vertebrae are fused, and known as the ''urostyle'' or ''coccyx''). The [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] bones are unfused and separate, making it probable ''Triadobatrachus'' was not an efficient leaper.

Another fossil frog, ''[[Prosalirus bitis]]'', was discovered in [[1995 in paleontology|1995]].

The earliest true frog is ''[[Vieraella herbsti]]'', from the early [[Jurassic]] (188&ndash;213 million years ago). It is known only from the [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] and [[ventral]] impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be {{convert|33|mm|abbr=on}} from snout to vent. ''[[Notobatrachus degiustoi]]'' from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger, about 155&ndash;170 million years old.

== Uses in agriculture and research ==
{{details|Animal testing on frogs}}
Frogs are raised commercially for several purposes. Frogs are used as a food source; [[frog legs]] are a delicacy in [[China]], [[France]], the [[Philippines]], the north of [[Greece]] and in many parts of the [[American South]], especially [[Louisiana]]. Dead frogs are sometimes used for [[dissection]]s in high school and university anatomy classes, often after being injected with coloured plastics to enhance the contrast between the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. This practice has declined in recent years with the increasing concerns about [[animal welfare]].

Frogs have served as important model organisms throughout the history of science. Eighteenth-century biologist [[Luigi Galvani]] discovered the link between [[electricity]] and the [[nervous system]] through studying frogs. The [[African clawed frog]] or platanna (''Xenopus laevis'') was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy assays in the first half of the 20th century. When [[human chorionic gonadotropin]], a [[hormone]] found in substantial quantities in the [[urine]] of pregnant women, is injected into a female ''X. laevis'', it induces them to lay [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. In 1952, [[Robert Briggs]] and [[Thomas J. King]] cloned a frog by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], the same technique later used to create [[Dolly the Sheep]], their experiment was the first time successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in metazoans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newton.nap.edu/html/biomems/rbriggs.html | title=Robert W. Briggs Biographical Memoir | accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref>

Frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of [[embryology]] because frogs are among the closest living relatives of man to lack egg shells characteristic of most other vertebrates, and therefore facilitate observations of early development. Although alternative pregnancy assays have been developed, biologists continue to use ''Xenopus'' as a [[model organism]] in [[developmental biology]] because it is easy to raise in captivity and has a large and easily manipulatable embryo. Recently, ''X. laevis'' is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative ''X. tropicalis'', which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than one to two years (as in ''X. laevis''),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-01-008.html | title=Developing the potential of ''Xenopus tropicalis'' as a genetic model | accessdate=2006-03-09 }}</ref> facilitating faster studies across generations.

Frogs feature prominently in [[folklore]], [[fairy tale]]s and popular culture. They tend to be portrayed as benign, ugly, clumsy, but with hidden talents. Examples include [[Michigan J. Frog]], [[The Frog Prince (story)|''The Frog Prince'']], and [[Kermit the Frog]]. Michigan J. Frog, featured in the [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'', only performs his singing and dancing routine for his owner. Once another person looks at him, he will return to a frog-like pose. "The Frog Prince" is a fairy tale of a frog who turns into a handsome prince once [[kiss]]ed. Kermit the Frog, on the other hand, is a conscientious and disciplined character of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and ''[[Sesame Street]]''; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behaviour of more flamboyant characters.

The [[Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] worshipped animals and often depicted frogs in their art.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol<U+00F3>gico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.</ref>
