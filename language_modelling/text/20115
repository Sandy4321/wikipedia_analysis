'''Harold Pinter''', <small>[[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]]</small> (10 October 1930 <U+2013> 24 December 2008) was a [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning English playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. One of the most influential modern British dramatists, his writing career spanned more than 50 years. His best-known plays include ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1957), ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1964), and ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978), each of which he adapted for the screen. His screenplay adaptations of others' works include ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'' (1963), ''[[The Go-Between (film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1970), ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), ''[[The Trial (1993 film)|The Trial]]'' (1993), and ''[[Sleuth (2007 film)|Sleuth]]'' (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television, and film productions of his own and others' works.

Pinter was born and raised in [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], east London, and educated at [[Hackney Downs School]]. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing [[National service|National Service]] as a [[conscientious objector]]. Subsequently, he continued training at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]] and worked in repertory theatre in [[Ireland]] and England. In 1956 he married actress [[Vivien Merchant]] and had a son, Daniel born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author [[Lady Antonia Fraser]] in 1980.

Pinter's career as a playwright began with a production of ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' in 1957. His second play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'', closed after eight performances, but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic [[Harold Hobson]]. His early works were described by critics as "[[comedy of menace]]". Later plays such as ''[[No Man's Land (play)|No Man's Land]]'' (1975) and ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978) became known as "memory plays". He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film. He also undertook a number of roles in works by other writers. He directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes, and other honours, including the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2005 and the French [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]] in 2007.

Despite frail health after being diagnosed with [[esophageal cancer|oesophageal cancer]] in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s one-act monologue ''[[Krapp's Last Tape#Harold Pinter|Krapp's Last Tape]]'', for the 50th anniversary season of the [[Royal Court Theatre]], in October 2006.  He died from [[liver cancer]] on 24 December 2008.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Pinter was born on 10 October 1930, in [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], east London, as the only child of lower middle class English parents of Jewish [[Eastern Europe]]an ancestry: his father, Jack Pinter (1902<U+2013>1997) was a ladies' tailor; his mother, Frances (n<U+00E9>e Moskowitz; 1904<U+2013>1992), a housewife.<ref name=GussowConv103>Harold Pinter, as quoted in Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 103.</ref>  Pinter believed an aunt's erroneous view that the family was [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and had fled the [[Spanish Inquisition]]; thus, for his early poems, Pinter used the pseudonym ''Pinta'' and at other times used variations such as ''da Pinto''.<ref name=Billington1>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 1<U+2013>5.</ref>  Later research by [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], Pinter's second wife, revealed the legend to be apocryphal; three of Pinter's grandparents came from Poland and the fourth from [[Odessa]], so the family was [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]].<ref name=Billington1/><ref name=JewishBackground>For some accounts of the significance of Pinter's Jewish background, see Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 2, 40<U+2013>41, 53<U+2013>54, 79<U+2013>81, 163<U+2013>64, 177, 286, 390, 429.</ref><ref name=Woolf1>[[Cf.]] {{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/jul/12/theatre.haroldpinter |title=My 60 Years in Harold's Gang|first=Henry |last=Woolf |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 July 2007|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu6rYC0X| archivedate=3 July 2011}}; Woolf, as quoted in Merritt, "Talking about Pinter" 144<U+2013>45; {{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/howard-jacobson/howard-jacobson-harold-pinter-didnt-get-my-joke-and-i-didnt-get-him-ndash-until-it-was-too-late-1297593.html |title=Harold Pinter didn't get my joke, and I didn't get him <U+2013> until it was too late |first=Howard |last=Jacobson |work=[[The Independent]] |date=10 January 2009 |publisher=[[Independent News & Media|INM]] |location=[[London, UK|London]] |issn=0951-9467 |oclc=185201487 |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu70UVpG|archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref>

Pinter's family home in London is described by his official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] as "a solid, red-brick, three-storey villa just off the noisy, bustling, traffic-ridden thoroughfare of the [[Lower Clapton]] Road".<ref name="Billington, Harold Pinter 2">Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 2.</ref> In 1940 and 1941, after [[the Blitz]], Pinter was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] from their house in London to [[Cornwall]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].<ref name="Billington, Harold Pinter 2"/>  Billington states that the "life-and-death intensity of daily experience" before and during the Blitz left Pinter with profound memories "of loneliness, bewilderment, separation and loss: themes that are in all his works."<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 5<U+2013>10.</ref>

Pinter discovered his social potential as a student at [[Hackney Downs School]], a London [[grammar school]], between 1944 and 1948. "Partly through the school and partly through the social life of Hackney Boys' Club ... he formed an almost sacerdotal belief in the power of male friendship. The friends he made in those days<U+2014>most particularly [[Henry Woolf]], Michael (Mick) Goldstein and Morris (Moishe) Wernick<U+2014>have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his life."<ref name=Woolf1/><ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 11.</ref>  A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long walks, talking about literature.<ref>A collection of Pinter's correspondence with Brearley is held in the [[Harold Pinter Archive]] in the British Library.  Pinter's memorial epistolary poem "Joseph Brearley 1909<U+2013>1977 (Teacher of English)", published in his collection ''Various Voices'' (177), ends with the following stanza: "You're gone.  I'm at your side,/Walking with you from [[Clapton Pond]] to [[Finsbury Park]],/And on, and on."</ref>  According to Billington, under Brearley's instruction, "Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and discovered a gift for acting."<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 10<U+2013>11.</ref><ref>See also "Introduction by Harold Pinter, ''Nobel Laureate''", 7<U+2013>9 in Watkins, ed., '' 'Fortune's Fool': The Man Who Taught Harold Pinter: A Life of Joe Brearley''.</ref>  In 1947 and 1948, he played [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]] and [[Macbeth (Macbeth)|Macbeth]] in productions directed by Brearley.<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 13<U+2013>14.</ref>

At the age of 12, Pinter began writing poetry, and in spring 1947, his poetry was first published in the ''Hackney Downs School Magazine''.<ref>Baker and Ross 127.</ref>  In 1950, his poetry was first published outside of the school magazine in ''[[Poetry London]]'', some of it under the pseudonym "Harold Pinta".<ref name=RansomColl>{{cite web |url= http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00108/hrc-00108.html |title=Harold Pinter: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |first= |last=Staff |work=[[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]]|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |year=2011  |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu7AvO6f|archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref><ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 29<U+2013>35.</ref>

===Sport and friendship===

He was a [[cricket]] enthusiast, taking his bat with him when evacuated during the Blitz.<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 7<U+2013>9 and 410.</ref> In 1971 he told [[Mel Gussow]]: "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket<U+2014>I play and watch and read about it all the time."<ref>Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 25.</ref> He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire Cricket Club]],<ref>Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 8.</ref> and devoted a section of his official website to the sport.<ref name=Gaieties>{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/cricket/index.shtml|title=Cricket|editor=Batty, Mark|work=haroldpinter.org|accessdate=5 December 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu7TuAYS |archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref> One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by [[Sarah Lyall]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas."<ref name=Lyall>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/movies/07lyal.html |title=Harold Pinter <U+2013> Sleuth |first=Sarah |last=Lyall |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 October 2007 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu7XaJEw|archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=Sherwin>{{cite news |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/article5963091.ece |title=Portrait of Harold Pinter playing cricket to be sold at auction |first=Adam |last=Sherwin |work=[[TimesOnline]] |date=24 March 2009|publisher=[[News Intl]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0140-0460 |accessdate=26 June 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zu7bv5v3|archivedate=3 July 2011}}</ref>  Pinter approved of the "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression."<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 410.</ref>  After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running.<ref>Supple, T.

Other interests that Pinter mentioned to interviewers are family, love and sex, drinking, writing, and reading.<ref name=GussowBillMerr>See, e.g., Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 25<U+2013>30; Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 7<U+2013>16; and Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 194.</ref> According to Billington, "If the notion of male loyalty, competitive rivalry and fear of betrayal forms a constant thread in Pinter's work from ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'' onwards, its origins can be found in his teenage Hackney years. Pinter adores women, enjoys flirting with them, worships their resilience and strength. But, in his early work especially, they are often seen as disruptive influences on some pure and [[Platonic love|Platonic]] ideal of male friendship: one of the most crucial of all Pinter's lost [[Garden of Eden|Edens]]."<ref name=Woolf1/><ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 10<U+2013>12.</ref>

===Early theatrical training and stage experience===

Beginning in late 1948, Pinter attended the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] for two terms, but hating the school, missed most of his classes, feigned a nervous breakdown, and dropped out in 1949.<ref name=BillingtonBatty1>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 20<U+2013>25, 31<U+2013>35; and Batty, ''About Pinter'' 7.</ref>  In 1948 he was called up for [[National service|National Service]]. He registered as a [[conscientious objector]], was brought to trial twice, and was ultimately fined for refusing to serve.<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 20<U+2013>25.</ref>  He had a small part in the Christmas [[pantomime]] ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'' at the [[Chesterfield]] Hippodrome in 1949 to 1950.<ref name=BillingtonBatty2>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 37; and Batty, ''About Pinter'' 8.</ref>  From January to July 1951, he attended the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].<ref name=BillingtonBatty3>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 31, 36, and 38; and Batty, ''About Pinter'' xiii and 8.</ref>

This relationship was another secret he kept from both his wife and Bakewell.<ref>Fraser, ''Must You Go?'' 86.</ref>  Initially, ''Betrayal'' was thought to be a response to his later affair with historian [[Antonia Fraser]], the wife of [[Hugh Fraser (politician)|Hugh Fraser]], and Pinter's "marital crack-up".<ref name="Billington, p. 257">Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 257.</ref>

In his last 25 years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, interviews and public appearances directly on political issues.  He was an officer in [[International PEN]], travelling with American playwright [[Arthur Miller]] to [[Turkey]] in 1985 on a mission co-sponsored with a [[Helsinki Watch]] committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers.  There he met victims of political oppression and their families.

=====''The Room'' and ''The Birthday Party'' (1957)=====
Pinter's first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'', written and first performed in 1957, was a student production at the [[University of Bristol]], directed by his good friend, actor [[Henry Woolf]], who also originated the role of Mr. Kidd (which he reprised in 2001 and 2007).<ref name=Plays/>  After Pinter mentioned that he had an idea for a play, Woolf asked him to write it so that he could direct it to fulfill a requirement for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days.<ref name=MerrittWoolf>Merritt, "Talking about Pinter" 147.</ref> The production was described by Billington as "a staggeringly confident debut which attracted the attention of a young producer, Michael Codron, who decided to present Pinter's next play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'', at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]], in 1958."<ref name=Billobit>{{cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/dec/25/pinter-theatre |title=The most provocative, poetic and influential playwright of his generation |first= Michael |last=Billington |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 December 2008|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuBM6lco | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>

Written in 1957 and produced in 1958, Pinter's second play, ''The Birthday Party'', one of his best-known works, was initially both a commercial and critical disaster, despite an enthusiastic review in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' by its influential drama critic [[Harold Hobson]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Harold|title=The Screw Turns Again|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=25 May 1958|location=London}}</ref> which appeared only after the production had closed and could not be reprieved.<ref name=Billobit/><ref>Hobson, "The Screw Turns Again"; cited by Merritt in "Sir Harold Hobson: The Promptings of Personal Experience," ''Pinter in Play'' 221<U+2013>25; rpt. in {{cite web |url= http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_bdayparty.shtml |title=The Birthday Party <U+2013> Premiere |first= Harold|last=Hobson |work=haroldpinter.org |year=2011 |accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuBQN70j | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>  Critical accounts often quote Hobson:

;{{blockquote|I am well aware that Mr Pinter[']s play received extremely bad notices last Tuesday morning. At the moment I write these [words] it is uncertain even whether the play will still be in the bill by the time they appear, though it is probable it will soon be seen elsewhere. Deliberately, I am willing to risk whatever reputation I have as a judge of plays by saying that ''The Birthday Party'' is not a Fourth, not even a Second, but a First [as in Class Honours]; and that Pinter, on the evidence of his work, possesses the most original, disturbing and arresting talent in theatrical London&nbsp;... Mr Pinter and ''The Birthday Party'', despite their experiences last week, will be heard of again. Make a note of their names.}}

Pinter himself and later critics generally credited Hobson as bolstering him and perhaps even rescuing his career.<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 85; Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 141.</ref>

In a review published in 1958, borrowing from the subtitle of ''The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace'', a play by [[David Campton]], critic [[Irving Wardle]] called Pinter's early plays "[[comedy of menace]]"<U+2014>a label that people have applied repeatedly to his work.<ref name=Merritt3>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 5, 9, 225<U+2013>26, and 310.</ref> Such plays begin with an apparently innocent situation that becomes both threatening and "[[Absurdism|absurd]]" as Pinter's characters behave in ways often perceived as inexplicable by his audiences and one another. Pinter acknowledges the influence of [[Samuel Beckett]], particularly on his early work; they became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments.<ref name = Wark /><ref name=BillingtonWark>See Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 64, 65, 84, 197, 251 and 354</ref>

=====''The Hothouse'' (1958/1980), ''The Dumb Waiter'' (1959), ''The Caretaker'' (1959), and other early plays=====
Pinter wrote ''[[The Hothouse]]'' in 1958, which he shelved for over 20 years (See "Overtly political plays and sketches" below).  Next he wrote ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1959), which premi<U+00E8>red in Germany and was then produced in a [[double bill]] with ''The Room'' at the [[Hampstead Theatre|Hampstead Theatre Club]], in London, in 1960.<ref name="Plays"/>  It was then not produced often until the 1980s, and it has been revived more frequently since 2000, including the [[West End theatre|West End]] [[Trafalgar Studios]] production in 2007.  The first production of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', at the [[Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre Club]], in London, in 1960, established Pinter's theatrical reputation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://roundabouttheatre.org/fc/fall03/jones.htm |title=Roundabout Theatre Company <U+2013>  |first=David |last=Jones |work=Front & Center Online |publisher=Roundabout Theatre Company|date=Fall 2003|accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuBZne33 |archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>  The play transferred to the [[Duchess Theatre]] in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances,<ref name=sheffcare>{{cite web|title=Background to The Caretaker|url=http://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/creativedevelopmentprogramme/productions/thecaretaker/background.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090514101843/http://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/creativedevelopmentprogramme/productions/thecaretaker/background.shtml|archivedate=2009-05-14|work=Sheffield Theatres education resource|publisher=Sheffield Theatres|accessdate=11 July 2011}}</ref> receiving an [[Evening Standard Award]] for best play of 1960.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shama|first=Sunita|title=Pinter awards saved for the nation|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press_releases/2010/Pinter_awards|work=British Library Press Release|publisher=Museums Arts and Libraries|accessdate=11 July 2011|date=20 October 2010}}</ref>  Large radio and television audiences for his one-act play ''[[A Night Out (play)|A Night Out]]'', along with the popularity of his revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention.<ref>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 18.</ref>  In 1964, ''The Birthday Party'' was revived both on television (with Pinter himself in the role of Goldberg) and on stage (directed by Pinter at the [[Aldwych Theatre]]) and was well received.<ref>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 18, 219<U+2013>20.</ref>

By the time Peter Hall's London production of ''The Homecoming'' (1964) reached [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1967, Pinter had become a celebrity playwright, and the play garnered four [[Tony Award]]s, among other awards.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tonyawards.com/p/tonys_search?start=0&year=&award=&lname=&fname=&show=%3Ci%3EThe+Homecoming%3C%2Fi%3E |title=The Homecoming <U+2013> 1967 |first= |last= |work=tonyawards.com |publisher=Tony Award Productions|year=2011 |accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> During this period, Pinter also wrote the radio play ''[[A Slight Ache]]'', first broadcast on the [[BBC Third Programme]] in 1959 and then adapted to the stage and performed at the [[Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre Club]] in 1961.  ''A Night Out'' (1960) was broadcast to a large audience on [[Associated British Corporation]]'s television show ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'', after being transmitted on BBC Radio 3, also in 1960.  His play ''Night School'' was first televised in 1960 on [[Associated Rediffusion]].  ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' premi<U+00E8>red at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in 1962, and ''[[The Dwarfs]]'', adapted from Pinter's then unpublished novel of the same title, was first broadcast on radio in 1960, then adapted for the stage (also at the Arts Theatre Club) in a double bill with ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'', which was then televised on Associated Rediffusion in 1963; and ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'', a play that Pinter developed from his 1963 short story, first broadcast on [[BBC TV]] in 1965.<ref name=Plays/>

Working as both a screenwriter and as a playwright, Pinter composed a script called ''[[The Basement (play)#Origin: "The Compartment"|The Compartment]]'' (1966), for a trilogy of films to be contributed by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]], and Pinter, of which only Beckett's film, titled ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'', was actually produced.  Then Pinter turned his unfilmed script into a television play, which was produced as ''[[The Basement (play)|The Basement]]'', both on [[BBC 2]] and also on stage in 1968.<ref name=BRChronology>Baker and Ross, "Chronology" xxiii<U+2013>xl.</ref>

===="Memory plays" (1968<U+2013>1982)====

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Pinter wrote a series of plays and sketches that explore complex ambiguities, elegiac mysteries, comic vagaries, and other "quicksand-like" characteristics of [[memory]] and which critics sometimes classify as Pinter's "[[memory play]]s".<ref name=BillingtonETP>Billington, Introduction, "Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics", ''Europe Theatre Prize<U+2013>X Edition'', [[Turin]], 10<U+2013>12 March 2006.

Some of Pinter's later plays, including ''Party Time'' (1991), ''[[Moonlight (play)|Moonlight]]'' (1993), ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996), and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000) draw upon some features of his "memory" [[dramaturgy]] in their focus on the past in the present, but they have personal and political resonances and other tonal differences from these earlier memory plays.<ref name=BillingtonETP/><ref name=MemoryPlays>See Batty, ''About Pinter''; Grimes; and Baker (all ''passim'').</ref>

====Overtly political plays and sketches (1980<U+2013>2000)====
Following a three-year period of creative drought in the early 1980s after his marriage to Antonia Fraser and the death of Vivien Merchant,<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 258.</ref> Pinter's plays tended to become shorter and more overtly political, serving as critiques of [[oppression]], [[torture]], and other abuses of [[human rights]],<ref name=MerrittPIPGrimes>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' xi<U+2013>xv and 170<U+2013>209; Grimes 19.</ref> linked by the apparent "invulnerability of power."<ref>Grimes 119.</ref>  Just before this hiatus, in 1979, Pinter re-discovered his manuscript of ''[[The Hothouse]]'', which he had written in 1958 but had set aside; he revised it and then directed its first production himself at [[Hampstead Theatre]] in London, in 1980.<ref name=HHNote>{{cite web |url= http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_hothouse.shtml |title=The Hothouse <U+2013> Premiere |first= Benedict|last=Nightingale |work=Originally published in the [[New Statesman]], archived at haroldpinter.org |year=2001 |accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuBkczsM | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref> Like his plays of the 1980s, ''The Hothouse'' concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, but it is also a comedy, like his earlier [[Comedy of menace|comedies of menace]].  Pinter played the major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the [[Minerva Theatre, Chichester]].<ref name=MerrittGrimesHH>Merritt, "Pinter Playing Pinter" (''passim''); and Grimes 16, 36<U+2013>38, 61<U+2013>71.</ref>

Pinter's brief dramatic sketch ''Precisely'' (1983) is a duologue between two bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation and [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].  His first overtly political one-act play is ''[[One for the Road (Harold Pinter play)|One for the Road]]'' (1984).  In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities of power and its abuse.<ref>Hern 8<U+2013>9, 16<U+2013>17, and 21.</ref> Pinter's "political theater dramatizes the interplay and conflict of the opposing poles of involvement and disengagement."<ref>Hern 19.</ref>  ''[[Mountain Language]]'' (1988) is about the Turkish suppression of the [[Kurdish language]].<ref name=BillingtonGussow/>  The dramatic sketch ''The New World Order'' (1991) provides what Robert Cushman, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' described as "10 nerve wracking minutes" of two men threatening to torture a third man who is blindfolded, gagged and bound in a chair; Pinter directed the British premi<U+00E8>re at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court Theatre Upstairs]], where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in 1994.<ref name=NWO>{{cite web |url= http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_newworldorder.shtml |title=Ten Nerve Racking Minutes of Pinter |first=Robert |last=Cushman |work=[[Independent on Sunday]], archived at haroldpinter.org |date= 21 July 1991 |accessdate=27 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuBoc8nA | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>  Pinter's longer [[political satire]] ''Party Time'' (1991) premi<U+00E8>red at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London, in a double-bill with ''Mountain Language''.

Intertwining political and personal concerns, his next full-length plays, ''[[Moonlight (play)|Moonlight]]'' (1993) and ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) are set in domestic households and focus on dying and death; in their personal conversations in ''Ashes to Ashes'', Devlin and Rebecca allude to unspecified atrocities relating to the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name=MerrittGrimesATA>Merritt, "Harold Pinter's ''Ashes to Ashes'': Political/Personal Echoes of the Holocaust" (''passim''); Grimes 195<U+2013>220.</ref> After experiencing the deaths of first his mother (1992) and then his father (1997), again merging the personal and the political, Pinter wrote the poems "Death" (1997) and "The Disappeared" (1998).

Pinter's last stage play, ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), is a social [[satire]] set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons [[The Ivy]], a fashionable venue in London's [[West End theatre]] district, and its patrons who "have just come from performances of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles.  [These] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic when it comes to their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there."<ref name=BrantleyLC>{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldpinter.org/home/lincolnfestival.shtml |title=Pinter's Silences, Richly Eloquent | last=Brantley | first= Ben |authorlink =  Ben Brantley |work= [[The New York Times]] archived at haroldpinter.org |date= 27 July 2001 |accessdate=9 May 2009 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuC33H9H | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>  On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in ''Party Time''), who describe themselves as "peaceful strategy consultants [because] we don't carry guns."<ref>Pinter, ''Celebration'' 60.</ref>  At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a "totally disordered personality ... a psychopath,"<ref>Pinter, ''Celebration'' 39.</ref> while Lambert "vows to be reincarnated as '[a] more civilised, [a] gentler person, [a] nicer person'."<ref>Pinter, ''Celebration'' 56.</ref><ref>Grimes 129.</ref>  These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness.  ''Celebration'' evokes familiar [[Characteristics of Harold Pinter's work#Pinteresque|Pinteresque]] political contexts: "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'&nbsp;... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'&nbsp;... have everything in common beneath the surface".<ref name=BrantleyLC/> "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence&nbsp;... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in ''Celebration'' with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo.<ref>Grimes 130.</ref>  Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in ''Celebration'', Pinter's final stage plays also extend some [[expressionism|expressionistic]] aspects of his earlier "memory plays", while harking back to his "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech:
{{blockquote|My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He got right out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.  He got that absolutely right.  And I'd like to make one further interjection.<br /> ''He stands still.  Slow fade''.<ref>Pinter, ''Celebration'' 72.</ref>|}}

During 2000<U+2013>2001, there were also simultaneous productions of ''[[Remembrance of Things Past (play)|Remembrance of Things Past]]'', Pinter's stage adaptation of his unpublished ''Proust Screenplay'', written in collaboration with and directed by [[Di Trevis]], at the [[Royal National Theatre]], and a revival of ''[[The Caretaker]]'' directed by [[Patrick Marber]] and starring [[Michael Gambon]], [[Rupert Graves]], and [[Douglas Hodge]], at the [[Comedy Theatre]].<ref name=Plays/>

Like ''Celebration'', Pinter's penultimate sketch, ''Press Conference'' (2002), "invokes both torture and the fragile, circumscribed existence of dissent".<ref>Grimes 135.</ref>  In its premi<U+00E8>re in the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]]'s two-part production of ''Sketches'', despite undergoing chemotherapy at the time, Pinter played the ruthless Minister willing to murder little children for the benefit of "The State".<ref name=Sketches>{{cite web | url= http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_sketches.shtml |first = Alastair | last = Macaulay |title =The Playwright's Triple Risk |work = [[The Financial Times]] archived  at haroldpinter.org |accessdate=9 May 2009| date=13 February 2002 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuC7Hxqm | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>

Allow the love of the good ghost.  They possess all that emotion ... trapped.  Bow to it.  It will assuredly never release them, but who knows ... what relief ... it may give them ... who knows how they may quicken ... in their chains, in their glass jars.  You think it cruel ... to quicken them, when they are fixed, imprisoned? No ... no.  Deeply, deeply, they wish to respond to your touch, to your look, and when you smile, their joy ... is unbounded.

===''Being Harold Pinter''===
In January 2011 ''Being Harold Pinter'', a theatrical collage of excerpts from Pinter's dramatic works, his Nobel Lecture, and letters of Belarusian prisoners, created and performed by the [[Belarus Free Theatre]], evoked a great deal of attention in the [[public media]].

In an additional sold-out benefit performance at the [[Public Theater]], co-hosted by playwrights [[Tony Kushner]] and [[Tom Stoppard]], the prisoner's letters were read by ten guest performers: [[Mandy Patinkin]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Olympia Dukakis]], [[Lily Rabe]], [[Linda Emond]], [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]], [[Stephen Spinella]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Laurie Anderson]], and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]].<ref name=BFT>{{cite web |url= http://broadwayworld.com/article/Kline_Hoffman_et_al_Lend_Support_to_Belarus_Free_Theater_with_BEING_HAROLD_PINTER_Benefit_at_The_Public_Tonight_117_20110117 |title=Kline, Hoffman et al.

===The Harold Pinter Theatre, London===
In September 2011, British Theatre owners, [[Ambassador Theatre Group]] (ATG) announced it was renaming its ''Comedy Theatre'', Panton Street, London to become ''The [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]''. [[Howard Panter]], Joint CEO and Creative Director of ATG told the [[BBC]], "The work of Pinter has become an integral part of the history of the Comedy Theatre. The re-naming of one of our most successful West End theatres is a fitting tribute to a man who made such a mark on British theatre who, over his 50 year career, became recognised as one of the most influential modern British dramatists." <ref>{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Harold Pinter has London theatre named after him|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14827867|accessdate=8 September 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 September 2011|publisher=BBC|location=London}}</ref>

Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf speaking to [[Raymond G. H. Seitz|Raymond Seitz]], then Minister at the US Embassy in London, "My parishioners built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We have lived in peace. A few months ago a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." Seitz responded, "Let me tell you something. In war, innocent people always suffer." Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq "an arbitrary military action inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.<ref name=ATPLecture>{{cite web |url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2005/pinter-lecture-e.html |title=Nobel Lecture <U+2013> Literature 2005 |first=Harold |last=Pinter |work=nobelprize.org |year=2005|accessdate=29 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuFyiiDW | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref>

Pinter's lecture has been widely distributed by print and online media and has provoked much commentary and debate,<ref>Billington, ''Harold Pinter'' 425<U+2013>27.</ref> with some commentators accusing Pinter of "anti-Americanism".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb=21_T12259220115&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=601&resultsUrlKey=29_T12259177788&cisb=22_T12259220136&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=249784&docNo=612 |title=Harold Pinter: the last anti-American |first=Gwynne |last=Dyer|work=The Guardian, archived at Lexis-Nexis|publisher=Transcontinental Media Group|location=Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island|date=13 December 2005|accessdate=29 June 2011|format=Subscription required}}</ref> In his Nobel Lecture, however, Pinter emphasises that he criticises policies and practices of American administrations (and those who voted for them), not all American citizens, many of whom he recognises as "demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government's actions".<ref name=ATPLecture />

===L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur===
On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] presented Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]], at a ceremony at the French Embassy in London.  De Villepin praised Pinter's poem "American Football" (1991) stating: "With its violence and its cruelty, it is for me one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence."  In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq.  M. de Villepin concluded: "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live."  He said that Pinter received the award particularly "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [Pinter's] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal".<ref name=FE>{{cite web |url= http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Legion-d-honneur-for-Harold-Pinter.html |title=L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur for Harold Pinter|first= |last=France in the United Kingdom |work=French Embassy in the UK |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=26 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuG2MDaw | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6273365.stm |title=French PM honours Harold Pinter |first= |last=Staff |work=[[BBC News]] |date=18 January 2007 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=26 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuG6OuSi | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}</ref> Lawrence Pollard observed that "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".<ref name=FE/>

==Scholarly response==
{{Main|Harold Pinter and academia}}
Some scholars and critics challenge the validity of Pinter's critiques of what he terms "the modes of thinking of those in power"<ref>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 171<U+2013>89.</ref> or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work.<ref>Begley; Karwowski; and Quigley.</ref> In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being "terribly disturbed as a young man by the Cold War. And McCarthyism&nbsp;... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly now that we have an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny."<ref>Quoted in Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' 178.</ref> Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.<ref name=BattyGrimes2>[[Cf.]], e.g., Batty, "Preface" (xvii<U+2013>xix) and chap. 6<U+2013>9 (55<U+2013>221) in ''About Pinter''; Grimes 19, 36<U+2013>71, 218<U+2013>20, and ''passim''.</ref>

Pinter's aversion to any censorship by "the authorities" is epitomised in Petey's line at the end of ''The Birthday Party''.  As the broken-down and reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg and McCann, Petey calls after him, "Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!"

As Pinter's long-time friend David Jones reminded analytically inclined scholars and dramatic critics, Pinter was one of the "great comic writers":<ref>{{cite book|url= http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521651239_CCOL0521651239A006 |title=Cambridge Collections Online : The sacred joke: Comedy and politics in Pinter's early plays |first=Francesca |last=Coppa |work=The Cambridge Companion to Harold Pinter |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-521-65842-3 |editor=Raby, Peter |format=Subscription required|accessdate=30 June 2011 |page=45}}</ref>{{blockquote|The trap with Harold's work, for performers and audiences, is to approach it too earnestly or portentously. I have always tried to interpret his plays with as much humor and humanity as possible. There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of ''The Caretaker'' is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned ''The Caretaker'' IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it."<ref name=JonesWoolf>{{cite web |url= http://roundabouttheatre.org/fc/fall03/jones.htm |title=Roundabout Theatre Company <U+2013> Front & Center Online |first=David |last=Jones |work=roundabouttheatre.org |year=Fall 2003|accessdate=29 June 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5zuGFjCOZ | archivedate = 3 July 2011}}; [[cf.]] Woolf, quoted in Merritt, "Talking about Pinter" 147<U+2013>48.</ref></blockquote>}}  His dramatic conflicts present serious implications for his characters and his audiences, leading to sustained inquiry about "the point" of his work and multiple "critical strategies" for developing interpretations and stylistic analyses of it.<ref>Merritt, ''Pinter in Play'' (''passim'').</ref>
