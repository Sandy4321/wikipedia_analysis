<!-- Walter Francis O'Malley (1903-1979)--> 
<!-- Social Security Number 090249001 -->
'''Walter Francis O'Malley''' ([[October 9]], [[1903]] &ndash; [[August 9]], [[1979]]) was an [[United States|American]] sports executive who owned the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] team in [[Major League Baseball]] from {{by|1950}} to {{by|1979}} and who was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Walter O'Malley |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057075/Walter-OMalley |quote=Walter Francis O'Malley, American lawyer who was the principal owner of the National League Brooklyn Dodgers professional baseball team (from 1958 the Los Angeles Dodgers). As owner of the Dodgers, he played a role in two of the key events in the history of both the club and the major leagues: Jackie Robinson's breaking of the colour barrier in {{by|1947}} and the expansion of the major leagues to the [[West Coast]]. |publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] |date= |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> He served as Brooklyn Dodger chief legal counsel when [[Jackie Robinson]] broke the racial [[color barrier]] in {{by|1947}}. In {{by|1958}}, as owner of the Dodgers, he brought major league baseball to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], moving the Dodgers from [[Brooklyn]] to [[Los Angeles]] and coordinating the move of the [[New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] to [[San Francisco]] at a time when there were no teams west of [[Missouri]].<ref name=WO/><ref name=move/>  For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodger fans.

O'Malley<U+2019>s Irish father was politically connected, and, as a [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[Salutatorian]] who went on to obtain a [[Juris Doctorate]], O<U+2019>Malley was well-educated.  O'Malley, who was born and raised in {{city-state|New York|New York}}, leveraged the combination of his family connections, his personal contacts, and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence.  First, he became an [[entrepreneur]] involved in [[public works]] contracting, and then he became an executive with the Dodgers.  He progressed from team [[lawyer]] to team owner and president, and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodger franchise.  Although he moved the franchise, O'Malley is known as a businessman whose major philosophy was stability through loyalty to and from his employees.<ref name=OfriHe/> 

==Early years==
[[Image:7768604 1063489231b.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Edwin O'Malley circa 1905]]
Walter O'Malley was the only child of [[Edwin O'Malley|Edwin Joseph O'Malley]] (1883&ndash;1955), who worked as a [[cotton]] goods [[sales]]man in the [[Bronx]] in 1903. Edwin O<U+2019>Malley would later become the [[Commissioner of Public Markets]] for [[New York City]]. Walter's mother was Alma Feltner (1882-1940).<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Walter in Wonderland |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868429,00.html |quote=The man with the ample jowls swiveled happily in his seat. Cigar ash dribbled over his shirt front, and his several chins bobbled as his tight little mouth widened into a smile. Everywhere he looked he saw money. There in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were 78,672 paying customers for the first home game of the Los Angeles Dodgers; no larger crowd had ever watched a single regular-season baseball game anywhere. So far as the Dodgers' President Walter Francis O'Malley was concerned, his team had already conquered Southern California. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)]] |date= |accessdate=2007-02-14 }}</ref>

O'Malley attended [[Jamaica High School (New York City)|Jamaica High School]] in [[Queens]] from 1918&ndash;1920 and then the [[Culver Academies|Culver Academy]] (the eventual high school alma mater of [[George Steinbrenner]])<ref name=JR166/> in [[Indiana]].<ref name=nytobit/> Then, he attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 1926 as the senior class Salutatorian.<ref name=WO/> At Penn, he was initiated into [[Theta Delta Chi]], and he also served as president of the Phi Deuteron Charge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.walteromalley.com/biog_short_page1.php?lang=eng | title=Biography: The Early Years | publisher=O'Malley Seidler Partners, LLC | accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> O<U+2019>Malley originally enrolled at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], but after his family lost their money in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], he switched to night school at [[Fordham University]]. He completed his [[Juris doctor|law degree]] in 1930 at [[Fordham University School of Law|Fordham Law]], and then he worked as an assistant engineer for the [[New York City Subway]]. He then worked for Thomas F. Riley who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O'Malley. With the help of Walter's father's political connections, the company received contracts from the [[New York Telephone Company]] and the [[New York City Board of Education]] to perform [[geological survey]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boxerman |first=Burton A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ebbets to Veeck to Busch: Eight Owners Who Shaped Baseball |year=2003 |publisher= |quote=... the Board of Education and the New York Telephone Company.

After the ownership transfer, O'Malley's rivalry with Rickey became very public.  O'Malley forbade the speaking of Rickey's name in Dodger offices with transgressors being subjected to a monetary fine.  He abolished Rickey's title of General Manager so that no front office person could perpetuate Rickey's role.  In addition, when Rickey assumed the title with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], O'Malley arranged for the Dodgers to omit the Pirates from their spring training schedule.<ref name=JR168/> Nonetheless, after the transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O'Malley: they won the National League pennants in {{by|1952}}, {{by|1953}}, {{by|1955}}, and {{by|1956}}.  In [[1955 in sports|1955]], the team won the [[World Series]] for the first time in their history.  Attendance declined from a peak of 1.7 million in {{by|1946}} and {{by|1947}} to just over one million per year in the mid-1950s.  With the advent of the affordable [[automobile]] and post-war prosperity, Brooklyn's formerly heterogeneous, middle-class fan base for the Dodgers began to splinter.<ref>{{cite book | last=Kahn | first=Roger | authorlink=Roger Kahn | title=[[The Boys of Summer (book)|The Boys of Summer]] | publisher=[[Harper & Row]] | year=1972 | isbn=06-012239-0}} pp. xv<U+2013>xvi.</ref>  A large [[white flight]] took place, and Ebbets Fields's shabby condition and lack of parking spaces led to the loss of fans who relocated to [[Long Island]].<ref name="nymag-anderson">{{cite news | url=http://nymag.com/news/sports/37643/ | title=Exorcising the Dodgers | author=Sam Anderson | publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' | date=[[September 17]], [[2007]] | accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> O'Malley tried to raise money and get the political backing to build a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|new ballpark]] elsewhere in Brooklyn.

O'Malley had wanted to build a new Brooklyn Dodger stadium at [[Flatbush Avenue (Brooklyn)|Flatbush]] and [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], but Moses  wanted the Dodgers to move to Queens and play in [[Flushing Meadows Park]] (the location where the [[New York Mets]] play today). O'Malley noticed the great success of the [[Milwaukee Braves]] after their move from Boston in 1953.

===Move to Los Angeles===
[[Image:Dodger-Stadium-Panorama-052707.jpg|thumb|right|Dodger Stadium ([[2007-05-27]])]]
O'Malley is considered by baseball experts to be "perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&content_id=5714&vkey=hof_pr|title=Veterans elect five into Hall of Fame: Two managers, three executives comprise Class of 2008|accessdate=2008-01-19|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc.|date=[[2007-12-03]]}}</ref> Following the [[1957 in baseball|1957 Major League Baseball season]]<!--Switch link to [[1957 Major League Baseball season]] when available-->, he moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles.

The joint move would make West Coast road trips more economical for visiting teams.<ref name=BL/> O'Malley met with Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]]&mdash;who was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota&mdash;and convinced Stoneham to join him on the West Coast at the end of the 1957 campaign. The moves broke the hearts of New York's National League fans but ultimately were successful for both franchises <U+2014> and for Major League Baseball as a whole.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} In the years following the move of the New York clubs, Major League Baseball expanded to include three other California based teams, as well as two in Texas and one each in Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona and Seattle.  In addition, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] moved to {{city-state|Kansas City|Missouri}} and eventually to {{city-state|Oakland|California}}. 

{{convert|352|acre|sqkm|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} in [[Chavez Ravine]] were transferred by the Los Angeles city government to O'Malley by an agreement which required O'Malley and the Dodgers to design, build, privately-finance and maintain a 50,000-seat stadium; develop a youth recreation center on the land. O'Malley was to pay $500,000 initially, plus annual payments of $60,000 for 20 years; and pay $345,000 in property taxes starting in 1962, putting the land on the tax rolls. Also, the Dodgers would transfer team-owned [[Wrigley Field]], then appraised at $2.2 million, to the city. The city exchanged "300 acres, more or less, in the Chavez Ravine area", while L.A. County Supervisors unanimously agreed to provide $2.74 million for access roads. In addition, the Dodgers also had to pay $450,000 for territorial rights to the Pacific Coast League, whose [[Los Angeles Angels]] and [[Hollywood Stars]] suspended play. <ref>{{cite news |first=Rube |last=Samuelsen  |authorlink=  |coauthors= |title=L.A.

When he made the decision to relocate in October of 1957 to Los Angeles, O'Malley did not have an established location for where the Dodgers would play in 1958. The Dodgers temporarily took up residence in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], while they awaited the completion of 56,000-seat capacity [[Dodger Stadium]], built for [[U.S. Dollar|$]]23 million. The Dodgers were soon drawing more than two million fans a year.  They remained successful on the field as well, winning the World Series in [[1959 World Series|1959]], [[1963 World Series|1963]], and [[1965 World Series|1965]]. The [[Los Angeles Angels]] also played in [[Dodger Stadium]] from 1962 to 1965.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mayor Is Blamed For Dodger Move; City Administration Scored By G.O.P.

His son, [[Peter O'Malley]], described his management style as follows: "As president, the way he ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was the strength of the organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field."<ref name=OfriHe/>  This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both [[Walter Alston]] and [[Tommy Lasorda]] as Dodger [[Manager (baseball)|manager]]s and [[Vin Scully]], the broadcast voice of the Dodgers.  Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954&ndash;1976 until he retired.

===Retire from presidency===
On [[March 17]], [[1970 in sports|1970]], Walter turned over the presidency of the team to his son Peter, remaining as Chairman until his death in 1979.

His legacy is that of changing the mindset of a league whose southernmost and westernmost team was the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].  Tom Lasorda said upon hearing of his election to the Hall, "He's a pioneer. He made a tremendous change in the game, opening up the West Coast to Major League Baseball."<ref name=OfriHe/>  When asked how he wanted to be remembered, O'Malley said, "for planting a tree."<ref name=OfriHe/>  The tree provided the branches to open up the West Coast to baseball, but O'Malley's son remembers his father's 28 years on Major League Baseball's executive council as service that "was instrumental in the early stages of the game's international growth."<ref name=OfriHe/>

==Popular culture==
O'Malley was mentioned several times in [[Danny Kaye]]'s 1962 song tribute, "The D-O-D-G-E-R-S Song (Oh, Really? No, O'Malley!)", which spins a tale of a fantasy game between the Dodgers and the Giants. At one point, the [[umpire]]'s call goes against the home team:
:''Down in the dugout, [[Walter Alston|Alston]] glowers''
:''Up in the booth, [[Vin Scully]] frowns;''
:''Out in the stands, O'Malley grins...''
:''Attendance 50,000!''
:''So ....what does O'Malley do? CHARGE!!

Just before the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] began a series of games against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, in [[1963 in baseball|1963]], the [[Los Angeles Times]] published a large cartoon, drawn by artist [[Pete Bentovoja]], modeled on the movies about the [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]] captain. The captain is Cards' manager [[Johnny Keane]]; his "lieutenant" is [[Stan Musial]]. They wear Cardinal uniforms with naval officers' caps bearing the "St.L" emblem. While Keane and Musial are speaking, other crew members load bats, like [[torpedoes]], into torpedo tubes; the bats have players' faces (and names and batting averages) drawn on them. Keane looks through the [[periscope]]; the [[inset]] shows a [[battleship]] with a large head of O'Malley, wearing a naval officers cap bearing the "LA" emblem and puffing a cigar.
Keane: "Achtung Shtan [Stan]! I zought ve sunk sem last year?"
Musial: "Yavohl, Mein Kommander, Ve vill blast zem vit bigger und better torpedoes zis zeazon!" (The Cards made a terrific drive for the pennant but finished the season six games back of the Dodgers.)

O'Malley was featured prominently in the [[HBO]] [[documentary film]], ''[[Brooklyn Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush]]'', which chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers,.
