The ''' Stork-billed Kingfisher''', ''Pelargopsis capensis'' (formerly ''Halcyon capensis''), is a [[tree kingfisher]] which is widely but sparsely distributed in tropical south [[Asia]] from [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Indonesia]]. This [[kingfisher]] is essentially resident throughout its range.

This is a very large kingfisher, 35 cm in length. The adult has a green back, blue wings and tail, and grey head. Its underparts and neck are buff. The very large bill and legs are bright red. The flight of the Stork-billed Kingfisher is laboured and flapping, but direct. 
Sexes are similar. There are 15 races, mostly differing in plumage detail, but ''P. c. gigantea'' of the Sulu Islands has a white head, neck and underparts. The call of this noisy kingfisher is a low and far reaching ''peer-por-por'' repeated every 5 seconds or so as well cackling ''ke-ke-ke-ke-ke-ke''.

Stork-billed Kingfisher is a species of a variety of well-wooded habitats near lakes, rivers or coasts. It perches quietly whilst seeking food, and is often inconspicuous despite its size. It is territorial and will chase away [[eagle]]s and other large predators. This species hunts fish, frogs, crabs, rodents and young birds.

Stork-billed Kingfisher digs its nest in a river bank, decaying tree, or a tree termite nest. A clutch of two to five round white eggs is typical.
