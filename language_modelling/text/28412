'''Mark Andrew Vermeulen''' (born [[2 March]] [[1979]] in Salisbury - now [[Harare]]) is a [[Zimbabwe]]an [[cricket]]er in both [[Test cricket|Test]] matches and [[One Day International]]s.

He is a right-handed opening [[batsman]] and occasional [[off spin]] bowler, playing for [[Matabeleland]] in the Zimbabwean [[Logan Cup]], with a good record at local level which he has rarely managed to replicate at international level.

The former captain of the national Under-19 team, Vermeulen was first selected for [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] to play in the second Test against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] in November [[2002]], after impressing in the local competition.

==Disciplinary problems==
He has had a number of disciplinary problems. Two incidents in particular stick out. He was sent home from Zimbabwe's tour of [[England]] in 2003 after ignoring management instructions to travel with the rest of the squad <ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/129464.html Cricinfo - Vermeulen sent home from Zimbabwe tour<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Then in 2006 he was banned from all cricket played under the auspices of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] after a violent altercation with spectators at a match between [[Ashton C.C.|Ashton]] and his club, [[Werneth C.C.|Werneth]] in the [[Central Lancashire League]]. The original ban imposed was ten years,<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/current/story/259501.html Cricinfo article - ''Vermeulen banned for 10 years'']</ref> but on appeal it was reduced to three years, two of which were suspended. The ban takes effect from [[1 April]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/5351746.stm Vermeulen ban reduced on appeal], [[BBC Sport]], [[19 September]] [[2006]].</ref>

On the [[2003]]-[[2004]] tour of Australia, Vermeulen [[fracture (bone)|fractured]] his [[skull]] during a One-Day International match against [[Indian cricket team|India]].  This was the second time this had happened to him inside a year, after the identical injury occurred in February 2003 while practising.  Successful [[surgery]] has limited the impact that these injuries have had on Vermeulen's cricketing career.

Vermeulen was one of the few white Zimbabwean cricketers to make himself available to play for the national team after a mass exodus of 'rebel' players in April [[2004]] during a dispute with [[Zimbabwe Cricket]], although as of May [[2005]] he has rarely been used at that level.

==Accusation of arson==
On 1 November [[2006]], Vermeulen was held by police after apparently fleeing the scene of a suspicious fire at the Zimbabwean Cricket Academy in [[Harare]]. A fire had also been set at the [[Zimbabwe Cricket]] headquarters. ZCU Managing Director [[Ozias Bvute]] confirmed that Vermeulen was being held "for questioning" in the incident. Vermeulen was formally charged with arson in the incident on 2 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/zimbabwe/6107480.stm|title=Further delay for Vermeulen trial|date=2006-12-06|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> In January 2008, he was cleared on grounds of mental illness, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/334349.html|title=Vermeulen cleared of arson|date=2008-01-31|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref> and in February announced that he was hoping to make a comeback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/current/story/336722.html|title=Vermeulen eyes international comeback|date=2008-02-14|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>

In May 2008 ,Vermeulen offered to help rebuild the academy he burnt by using a percentage of his earnings that he would get by playing for Zimbabwe again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/350767.html|title=Vermeulen offers to help rebuild Academy|date=2008-05-12|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2008-06-25}}</ref>.A complete turnaround was achieved when he was selected for the Zimbabwe A tour of Namibia in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/story/336722.html|title=Vermeulen poised for remarkable comeback|date=2009-02-23|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref>
