[[University of Kashmir]]'s '''University Convocation Complex''' ('''UCC''') is one of the largest auditorium facilities not only in the State of [[Jammu & Kashmir]] [[India]] but in the whole of [[North India]]<ref>{{cite news|last = Wani|first=Arif Shafi|title=Forget SKICC, KU<U+2019>s Convocation Complex to be biggest in north India|newspaper=[[Greater Kashmir]]|location=Srinagar|date=2007-05-14|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2007/May/14/forget-skicc-ku-s-convocation-complex-to-be-biggest-in-north-india-61.asp|accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref>. It is located within the [[University of Kashmir]]'s Hazratbal Campus adjacent to the [[Dal Lake]],[[Srinagar]] and in the vicinity of the [[Hazratbal Shrine]]. The Complex is spread over an area of 25,000 sq ft and accessible from both gates of the University Campus; Sir Syed Gate and Maulana Rumi Gate. It has a seating capacity of 1,907 persons. The Complex was constructed by University Construction Division with assistance from Kadiri Consultants, [[Mumbai]] and Construction Engineers, [[Srinagar]].

The first director to head the Directorate of Convocation Complex was Dr. S Mufeed Ahmed of The Business School, University of Kashmir. He has recently been succeeded by Dr. M S Sumbli<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr Sumbli is Director KU Convocation Complex |newspaper=[[Greater Kashmir]]|location=Srinagar|date=2011-11-25 |url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2011/Nov/25/dr-sumbli-is-director-ku-convocation-complex-41.asp}}</ref>, Deputy Registrar at the University.

== History ==

Sensing the need for such a facility<ref>{{cite news|title=Kashmir University to have its convocation complex |work=[[Oneindia.in]]|date=2007-03-06 |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/03/06/kashmir-university-to-have-its-convocation-complex-1173182285.html}}</ref>, work on the University Convocation Complex commenced on November 7th, 1981 when the foundation stone of the multi-Crore project was laid by then [[Chief Minister]] of [[Jammu & Kashmir]], [[Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah]]. Soon after, the construction work remained suspended for several years due to technical reasons.

Work on the Complex however resumed in February 2004 after a peer team from the [[National Assessment and Accreditation Council]] while on an on-site visit suggested that the completion of the Complex be undertaken. The University<U+2019>s Construction Division with the help of Kadiri Consultants, Mumbai and Construction Engineers, Srinagar went on to complete the Complex and it was finally thrown open on the 4th July, 2007 by Lt Gen (Retd.) S K Sinha, who was then Chancellor of the University of Kashmir.

== Construction ==

Construction of this complex cost {{Indian Rupee}} 8 crores<ref>{{cite web|title=Valley<U+2019>s biggest auditorium|url=http://propertybytes.indiaproperty.com/index.php/city-scape/valleys-biggest-auditorium|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>.
