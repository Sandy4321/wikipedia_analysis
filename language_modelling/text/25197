'''Weston-super-Mare Association Football Club''' (also known as '''Weston''', '''The Seagulls''', or '''The Gulls''') are an [[England|English]] semi-professional [[football (soccer)|football]] [[football team|club]] based in [[Weston-super-Mare]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]].  They play in the [[Conference South]].  The team's claim to fame is that they have never been relegated in their history, although that title has come under heavy pressure lately.  The team's best performance in the [[FA Cup]] came in [[2003-04 in English football|2003/04]] when they reached the second round of the competition.

Weston were founded in [[1887 in football (soccer)|1887]], but disbanded twice (once for [[World War I]], then again for [[World War II]]).  The club were reformed in [[1948 in football (soccer)|1948]] and have since moved up to Step 6 of the [[English football league system|English Football League System]] where they currently play today.  In the [[2006-07 in English football|2006/07]] season, Weston finished league play 21st out of 22 teams and seemed destined for their first relegation.  However, due to financial irregularities at one club and the merging of two others, The Seagulls remained safe for another year.

Weston-super-Mare has a modest fan base and a fierce rivalry with local club [[Clevedon Town F.C.]], who are situated in [[Clevedon]], [[North Somerset]].  However, the rivalry has been put on the back-burner as of late since Weston-super-Mare was promoted to the [[Southern Football League Premier Division|Dr. Martens League Premier Division]] in [[2002-03 in English football|2002/2003]] after winning promotion at Clevedon Town 1-0.  The two have not played in the same league since due to Clevedon's inability to be promoted and Weston's inability to be relegated.


==History==
'''Weston-super-Mare A.F.C.''' was formed in 1887,{{Fact|date=December 2007}} with the team's first match being against near-neighbours [[Clevedon Town F.C.|Clevedon Town]] in a "Medal Competition" organised by the [[Somerset]] FA.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In 1900 they joined the [[Western Football League]] but left after two years.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  In 1910 they rejoined this league and played there until [[World War I]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Between the wars, the club played in local leagues but disbanded upon the outbreak of hostilities.  The club reformed in 1948 and immediately rejoined the Western League, initially in Division Two.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  At this time the team played at the Great Ground in Locking Road, where initially there was no cover for spectators and the players had to change in a marquee.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  The team remained in the Second Division until the league consolidated to a single division in 1960.  During this time they moved to the Langford Road Ground.  In 1976 they were placed into the Western League Premier Division upon the creation of a second tier, meaning that by their centenary in 1987 they had never been promoted or relegated in their history.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

In 1989 John Ellener was appointed manager and led the club to the Western League championship in 1991-92 and with it promotion to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Midland Division.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  They remained at this level, playing successively in the Midland, Southern, Midland (again) and Western Divisions due to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]'s regular reorganisations, until 2002-03 when they finished in second place and were promoted to the [[Southern League Premier Division|Premier Division]], clinching promotion with a win away to rivals Clevedon Town.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

In their first Premier Division season they finished in 10th place, enough to clinch a place in the newly-formed [[Conference South]], where they played until 2006&ndash;2007, in which they were seemingly relegated. However, in a bizarre twist, [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough Town]] were relegated due to going into liquidation and [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes]] and [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]] merged to form [[Hayes & Yeading United F.C.|Hayes & Yeading United]], leaving [[Conference South]] one team short. This led to Weston not being relegated after all.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Ground==
[[Image:Woodspring.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Woodspring Stadium]]
{{main|Woodspring Stadium}}
The club moved to the new purpose-built Woodspring Stadium in August 2004.  They previously played at the similarly-named Woodspring Park a short distance away.  The move marked the third time in the past 40 years that Weston-super-Mare have changed venues.  The capacity of Woodspring Stadium is 3,500 in which 2,000 is covered and 350 are seated.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Woodspring Park had been built almost entirely by supporters and boasted a clubhouse costing <U+00A3>100,000.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  The Park had been the home of Weston-super-Mare since 1983 and had floodlights installed in 1986.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  Weston-super-Mare sold this ground to a residential home builder when it became apparent the club was going to move the short distance to Woodspring Stadium.  The last home fixture was played in April of 2004.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

The ground for what is now Woodspring Stadium was formerly a sporting complex owned by [[Westland Aircraft]] known as Westland Sports Ground.  It was home to [[cricket]] and football in addition to social buildings.  Difficult financial times forced Westland to reconsider their place in town and put the ground up for sale.  Weston-super-Mare purchased it for <U+00A3>270,000 in 2001.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  The Stadium opened August 14th, 2004, with its first match against [[Conference South]] opponent (and now defunct) [[Hornchurch F.C.]] drawing only 500 people to the game.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  This was well under the 3,500 capacity.<ref>Groundtastic - The Football Grounds Magazine.
