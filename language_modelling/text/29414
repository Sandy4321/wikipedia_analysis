'''Arthur "Fatboy" Chubb''' (also credited as '''Fat Boy''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'' and its Internet [[EastEnders spin-offs|spin-off]] ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'', played by [[Ricky Norwood]]. He made his first appearance in ''EastEnders'' on 5 January before appearing in the spin-off. Fatboy is one of four main characters in the first series of ''E20'' and makes cameo appearances in the second series. He was created by the ''EastEnders: E20'' writing team during a BBC summer school in August 2009. He frequently uses [[London street slang]] and is described as brash, confident, caring, a hustler and a womaniser.  Critics have called him zany, an asset to the show, authentic, a clich<U+00E9>, and yet to serve a purpose, with Stuart Heritage from ''[[The Guardian]]'' calling for him to be axed. Norwood won the Best Newcomer award at the 2010 [[Inside Soap Awards]] and Most Popular Newcomer at the [[16th National Television Awards|2011]] [[National Television Awards]] for his portrayal of Fatboy, and has been nominated for one further award.

==Storylines==
Fatboy first appears in ''EastEnders'' at [[Lucy Beale]]'s ([[Melissa Suffield]]) party, where he gets pleasure from watching a fight between two girls, and asks other girls to play [[Twister (game)|Twister]] with him but nobody will. In ''EastEnders: E20'', he helps his friend [[Mercy Olubunmi]] ([[Bunmi Mojekwu]]) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet [[Leon Small]] ([[Sam Attwater]]) and [[Zsa Zsa Carter|Zsa&nbsp;Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells Zsa&nbsp;Zsa and Leon both his parents were killed in a drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in [[Wanstead]], but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.

After several weeks, Leon and Fatboy return to Walford to look for Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, who has run away. They eventually settle in and make new friends. Zsa&nbsp;Zsa finds three dates for Fatboy, but none of them are genuine. Fatboy borrows [[Darren Miller]]'s ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) ice cream van to practice for his driving test, which he fails, but he buys the van from Darren. He helps [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) sell t-shirts but sells them to [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]), who has been asked by [[Becca Swanson (EastEnders)|Becca Swanson]] ([[Simone James]]) to buy them so she can sell them for a greater profit. Becca insists she did not know they were Whitney's and then flirts with Fatboy. However, he later humilates her by designing t-shirts for her that show a mirror image of the word "[[chav]]". He finally passes his driving test and DJs for [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) at [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R]] nightclub. Fatboy, Leon, Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, Whitney, Lucy and Lucy's brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] ([[Thomas Law]]) go to Hampshire and he attends a party with Peter while the others spend time in the woods. He is reunited with Mercy but a fight breaks out so they escape and drive back to Fatboy's uncle's home. Peter hits something with the van and the next day they fear it was Leon, as he is missing. However, Leon turns up and they realise Lucy wanted to turn everyone against him, so they play a trick on her in revenge. Fatboy is then shocked to discover that Mercy is planning to move back to Nigeria. He realises that neither Mercy nor her grandmother [[Grace Olubunmi|Grace]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]) want to leave London, and convinces them to stay.

During a party at the community centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses [[Denise Johnson]] ([[Diane Parish]]), angering her husband [[Lucas Johnson|Lucas]] ([[Don Gilet]]), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife [[Trina Johnson|Trina]] ([[Sharon Duncan Brewster]]), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and Zsa&nbsp;Zsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband [[Jim Branning|Jim]] ([[John Bardon]]) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.

Leon breaks one of Grace's commemorative plates, but Mercy takes the blame. Fatboy fails to raise money to replace it so he sticks a photo onto an ordinary plate. She does not fall for it but he admits he broke the plate and Mercy had nothing to do with it. She appreciates his eventual honesty and displays the new plate with her others. Leon obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, but he tells Fatboy he slept with [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]), leaving Fatboy unsure of what to do as he does not want to hurt Zsa&nbsp;Zsa. He tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, who dumps Leon and takes Fatboy's van to France. Leon decides to go to France anyway, leaving Fatboy sad at the loss of two of his best friends, however, Leon and Fatboy stay in contact. He joins the local church choir but fears he will be unable to perform at their event as he felt pressured into joining by Dot and cannot sing very well. Mercy tells him he should just mime, but then Dot and the choir leader [[Edward Bishop (EastEnders)|Edward Bishop]] ([[Frank Barrie]]) decide to give Fatboy a solo. Fatboy is unable to go through with it and walks out of the performance, so [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) takes over. At a New Year's Eve party, Fatboy kisses Mercy to put Kim off flirting with him.

==Creation and development==
Fatboy is one of four characters created for the first series of the ''EastEnders'' online spin-off ''EastEnders: E20'' who also appear in the main show, along with Zsa&nbsp;Zsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from ''E20'', was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the [[BBC]] in August 2009.<ref name="understand2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57w_XyMfv2M|title=Eastenders E20: How to Make Your Own Online Drama - Part 2: The Cast and Script - BBC|publisher=[[BBC]]|format=video|accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> Open auditions for the cast were held at [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]].<ref name="understand2"/> Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said "I am so excited to be on the show.

===Characterisation===
When the character was announced, he was described as a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a188403/eastenders-e20-the-characters.html|title='EastEnders: E20' - The Characters|last=Green|first=Kris|date=25 November 2009|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|location=London|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> Norwood expanded on this, saying "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it got to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [[wikt:take the mickey|took the mickey]] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world."<ref name="street">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/entertainment/newsid_10000000/newsid_10004100/10004180.stm|title=E20 'is bringing street to Albert Square'|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|first=Sinead|last=Garvan|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> Before apopting the "Fatboy" persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was "an awkward kind of child".<ref name="Walford Web">{{cite news|url=http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/item.php?id=2803|title=Ricky Norwood hits the Spotlight|date=21 January 2011|work=Walford Web|accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/08/e202.shtml|title=EastEnders: E20 <U+2013> interview with Ricky Norwood|publisher=[[BBC]] Press Office|date=8 January 2010|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> He often wears clothing brand [[Ed Hardy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlinefashionagency.com/shoppers-counsel/where-celebrities-shop/01/13/steal-fatboys-ed-hardy-style-as-seen-on-eastenders-spin-off-e20/|title=Steal Fatboy's Ed Hardy style as seen on EastEnders spin-off E20|last=Barker|first=Charlie|date=13 January 2010|publisher=The Online Fashion Agency|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> and his speech has, according to Norwood, a "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.<ref name="Walford Web" />

Norwood said the character's introduction was "trying to bring the street to Albert Square"<ref name="street" /> and that the street slang the character uses is what he grew up with himself.<ref name="street" /> He described the character in an interview with entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] as "[wanting] to be a gangsta at times, a caring person, a player, a womaniser, the businessman... There are so many things that he wants to be and that shifts depending on the situation,"<ref name="quick chat" /> adding that he is quick to solve problems and always has a plan.<ref name="quick chat">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a195875/a-quick-chat-with-fatboy-from-enders-e20.html|title=A quick chat with Fatboy from 'Enders: E20'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=13 January 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|location=London|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref> Additionally, a profile for the character on the official ''EastEnders'' website calls him brash, a [[wikt:wheeler-dealer|wheeler-dealer]], confident and a loveable soft-touch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/fatboy.shtml|title=Fatboy played by Ricky Norwood|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>

Norwood said in January 2011 that Fatboy has developed over time and is continuing to develop, with more sides to his personality being shown.<ref name="Walford Web" /> Fatboy's caring side is shown in several ''EastEnders'' scenes, most notably his friendship with Dot, and a scene where Fatboy and Mercy bring a cake to [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) after her child dies of cot death. Although Norwood said in January 2011 that Fatboy will always be a joker, he felt it was good to show Fatboy's softer, more intelligent side, saying that the character's "street" side drops quickly when he is around Dot and Mercy. Norwood said that Fatboy wants to improve himself, but fears that showing his caring side in London will get him beaten up.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a299235/ricky-norwood-fatboy-eastenders.html|title=Ricky Norwood (Fatboy, 'EastEnders')|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=20 January 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=20 January 2011|location=London}}</ref>

Fatboy attends a dance audition, and witnesses [[Asher Levi]] ([[Heshima Thompson]]) bribing [[List of EastEnders: E20 characters#Skolla|Skolla]] (Tony Adigun) to let Asher's brother [[Sol Levi|Sol]] (Tosin Cole) through even though he failed his audition. Asher threatens Fatboy with a knife, telling him that he saw nothing. In episode 5 Fatboy attends callbacks for the dance group, and in episode 7, he dances with the group again and helps break up a fight between Asher and Sol.

Fatboy also appears in "[[East Street (Children in Need)|East Street]]", a charity [[fictional crossover|crossover episode]] between ''EastEnders'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]'', broadcast on 19 November 2010 as part of the [[BBC One]] [[telethon]] for the children's charity [[Children in Need]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a288267/in-pictures-enders-corrie-crossover.html|title=In Pictures: 'Enders, Corrie crossover|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=17 November 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=17 November 2010|location=London}}</ref> In the [[canon (fiction)|non-canon]] episode, Fatboy is in Walford's caf<U+00E9> while Denise Johnson and [[Gail McIntyre]] ([[Helen Worth]]) from ''Coronation Street'' argue over their similar storylines.

==Reception==
In April 2010, six main characters were axed from ''EastEnders'' by executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]]. Fatboy was not one of them, but Stuart Heritage from ''[[The Guardian]]'' felt that he should have been, calling him "A wodge of irritating comic relief [...] who is yet to serve a purpose other than making me genuinely dislike young people. [...] He must go, preferably in a scene where he falls down the world's largest flight of stairs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/apr/19/eastenders-character-cull-bbc|title=EastEnders: six characters to get the chop.

I love Fatboy's "wheels", ie a retired, graffiti-splattered ice-cream van. I love his simple approach to life: making money, "checkin out batty", eating [[jollof rice]]. Get rich or die trying (though by "die", I really mean "get sulked at by [[Dot Branning]] and refused a last-minute service wash"). I love how much Fatboy infuriates old-fart viewers with the uncomfortable truth that he's actually quite authentic.
