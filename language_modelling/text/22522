'''Marcos de Torres y Rueda''' ([[April 25]], [[1591]], Almaz<U+00E1>n, [[Spain]]&mdash;[[April 22]], [[1649]], [[Mexico City]]) was bishop of [[Yucatan]] (1646-1649), viceroy of [[New Spain]], and president of the [[Audiencia]] of New Spain. His term as viceroy ran from [[May 13]], [[1648]] to [[April 22]], [[1649]]. His name is sometimes given as ''Marcos Torres y Rueda''.

==In Spain==
Marcos de Torres y Rueda was born in Spain in 1591 (some sources say 1588). He studied at the University of Alcal<U+00E1> de Henares, with much distinction, graduating as licenciado in arts. Thereafter he occupied the chair of theology at Alcal<U+00E1>, and also at the University of Valladolid. He was canon of the cathedral of Burgos and rector of the College of San Nicol<U+00E1>s in Burgos when King [[Philip IV of Spain]] nominated him for bishop of Yucatan. [[Pope Innocent X]] named him to fill the position on [[December 18]], [[1645]].

==In the New World==
He arrived in New Spain the following year, was consecrated in [[Puebla]], and took up his position as bishop [[November 9]], [[1646]]. Only a few months later, on [[July 10]], [[1647]], King [[Philip IV of Spain]] named him viceroy and president of the Audiencia.

He arrived in Mexico City and took up his new offices on [[May 13]], [[1648]], leaving the governance of the Diocese of Yucatan in the hands of the chapter of the cathedral. The outgoing viceroy, [[Garc<U+00ED>a Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd conde de Salvatierra]], did not wish to surrender his office or the royal treasury, and direct intervention from the crown was needed.

Because of his other duties, he was not present at the installation of Our Lady of Izamal as patron of Yucatan ([[August 23]], [[1648]]).

He governed the viceroyalty for a little less than one year. The most notable occurrence during this time was the auto-de-fe held [[April 11]] to [[April 12]], [[1649]] in the plaza El Volador. There 13 men and women were garroted to death and another 94 received lashes. In the former group was Tom<U+00E1>s Tremi<U+00F1>o de Campos, a Portuguese Jew. Among the things he was accused of were using the "Mexican language" and speaking ill of the Inquisition, the king and the pope. Antonio B<U+00E1>ez and B. Tirado were accused of saying "Christians are beasts". Pedro Mercado was accused of giving preferential seating to Jews at a comedy he produced.

By this point very ill, the viceroy did not attend the event. He died shortly after in Mexico City.

On [[April 14]], [[1649]], days before the viceroy's death, a revolt broke out among the [[Tarahumara]] Indians. Torres y Rueda was too ill to deal with it, and it was left to his successor, [[Luis Enr<U+00ED>quez de Guzm<U+00E1>n, conde de Alba de Liste]].

Torres y Rueda died [[April 22]], [[1649]] in Mexico City. He was interred in the church of the convent of San Agust<U+00ED>n. The Audiencia took up the government, pending the arrival of the new viceroy.

Although he performed the functions of viceroy and his name consistently appears in the lists of viceroys of New Spain, Torres y Rueda never formally held the title. His title was ''gobernador'' (governor).
