'''''Miniopterus aelleni''''' is a [[bat]] in the genus ''[[Miniopterus]]'' that occurs on [[Anjouan]] in the [[Comoros]] and in northern and western [[Madagascar]]. It is a small, brown bat; its forearm length is 35 to 41&nbsp;mm (1.4 to 1.6&nbsp;in). The long [[Tragus (ear)|tragus]] (a projection in the outer ear) has a broad base and a blunt to rounded tip. The [[uropatagium]] (tail membrane) is sparsely haired. The [[palate]] is flat and there are distinct [[diastema (dentistry)|diastemata]] (gaps) between the upper [[canine (tooth)|canines]] and [[premolar]]s.

Populations of this species have historically been included in ''[[Miniopterus manavi]]'', but evidence published in 2008 and 2009 indicates that ''M. manavi'' is actually a complex of five separate species, including the newly described ''M.&nbsp;aelleni''. ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'' has been found in forests and caves in [[karst topography|karstic]] areas. Its distribution generally overlaps that of ''[[Miniopterus griveaudi|M.&nbsp;griveaudi]]'', also formerly included in ''M.&nbsp;manavi''.

==Taxonomy==
In a 1995 contribution to ''[[Faune de Madagascar]]'' on Malagasy bats, [[Randolph Peterson]] and colleagues listed four species of ''[[Miniopterus]]'' on Madagascar and the nearby [[Comoros]], including the small ''[[Miniopterus manavi]]'' with a broad distribution on both Madagascar and the Comoros.<ref>Peterson et al., 1995, pp.&nbsp;120<U+2013>135</ref> However, during the first decade of the 21st century, [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular studies]] have revealed that ''Miniopterus'', a widespread genus in the Old World, is much more species-rich than previously thought.  A 2008 study comparing sequences of the [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] and [[D-loop]] markers found two distinct, unrelated groups within the supposed ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' from the Comoros; both groups were also found on Madagascar.<ref>Weyeneth et al., 2008, p.&nbsp;5205</ref> The next year, [[Steven Goodman]] and colleagues revisited the group with more extensive sampling on Madagascar. They separated three species within the former "''M.&nbsp;manavi''": ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' itself in the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]], ''[[Miniopterus griveaudi|M.&nbsp;griveaudi]]'' (previously a [[subspecies]] of ''M.&nbsp;manavi'') on [[Anjouan]], [[Grande Comore]], and northern and western Madagascar, and the newly described ''Miniopterus aelleni'' on Anjouan and northern and western Madagascar.<ref name=Gea339>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;339</ref> The [[specific name]] ''aelleni'' honors Prof. [[Villy Aellen]] of the [[Natural History Museum of Geneva]], who has done much research on African bats.<ref name=Gea353>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;353</ref> Within ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'', Goodman and colleagues found some differentiation (3.4% [[sequence divergence|divergence]] in cytochrome ''b'' sequences) between individuals from [[Montagne d'Ambre]] in northern Madagascar and those from Anjouan and [[Ankarana]], near Montagne d'Ambre; the cytochrome ''b'' divergence between ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'' and other Malagasy ''Miniopterus'' is 7 to 10%.<ref name=Gea355>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;355</ref>

Later in 2009, Goodman and colleagues described two more species of ''M.&nbsp;manavi''-like Malagasy ''Miniopterus'': ''[[Miniopterus brachytragos|M.&nbsp;brachytragos]]'' from northern Madagascar and ''[[Miniopterus mahafaliensis|M.&nbsp;mahafaliensis]]'' from the southwest.<ref name=Gea1>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;1</ref> On the basis of cytochrome ''b'' sequences, they found that ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'' was most closely related to a [[clade]] of ''M.&nbsp;brachytragos'', ''M.&nbsp;manavi'', and another recently described Malagasy species, ''[[Miniopterus petersoni|M.&nbsp;petersoni]]''.<ref>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;6, fig.&nbsp;2</ref> The five recognized species of ''M.&nbsp;manavi''-like bats are not each others' closest relatives, but apparently acquired their similarities through [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=Gea28>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;28</ref> At some places (for example, [[Tsingy de Namoroka Strict Nature Reserve|Namoroka]]) four [[cryptic species]] of ''M.&nbsp;manavi''-like bats, including ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'', occur together.<ref>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;30, table&nbsp;7</ref>

''Miniopterus aelleni'' is a small, brown ''Miniopterus'' species. The head may be slightly lighter in color than the body. Some hairs on the underparts have buff tips.<ref>Goodman et al., 2009a, pp.&nbsp;353<U+2013>354</ref> ''Miniopterus griveaudi'' is similar in color, but ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' is darker<ref name=Gea356>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;356</ref> and ''M.&nbsp;brachytragos'' and ''M.&nbsp;mahafaliensis'' are lighter.<ref>Goodman et al., 2009b, pp.&nbsp;21<U+2013>22</ref> The [[Tragus (ear)|tragus]] (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip.<ref name=Gea354/> In ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' and ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'', in contrast, the base is narrower,<ref name=Gea356/> in ''M.&nbsp;mahafaliensis'', the sides of the tragus are parallel, and ''M.&nbsp;brachytragus'' has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair.<ref name=Gea21>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;21</ref> The wing membrane is also brown, but the [[uropatagium]] is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs.<ref name=Gea354/> In contrast, ''M.&nbsp;manavi'', ''M.&nbsp;mahafaliensis'', and ''M.&nbsp;brachytragos'' have densely covered uropatagia and that of ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'' is almost naked.<ref name=Gea22>Goodman et al., 2009b, p.&nbsp;22</ref> Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.<ref name=Gea354>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;354</ref>

In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short and line-shaped,<ref name=Gea354/> but longer than in other ''manavi''-like species.<ref name=Gea22/> The central groove in the [[nasal depression]] is relatively narrow. The [[frontal bone]]s are rounded and bear a well-developed [[sagittal crest]]. Further back on the braincase, the [[lambdoid crest]] is also prominent.<ref name=Gea354/> The middle part of the [[palate]] is flat, as in ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' but unlike in ''M.&nbsp;brachytragos'', ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'', and ''M.&nbsp;mahafaliensis'', which have a curved palate.<ref name=Gea22/> At the palate's back margin is a long, thin [[posterior palatal spine]]. ''Miniopterus aelleni'' has 36&nbsp;teeth in the [[dental formula]] {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=3.1.3.3}} (two [[incisor]]s, one [[canine (tooth)|canine]], two [[premolar]]s, and three [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s in both upper toothrows and three incisors, one canine, three premolars, and three molars in the lower toothrows). As is characteristic of ''Miniopterus'', the first upper premolar (P2; P1 and P3 are missing) is smaller and more simplified than the second (P4).<ref name=Gea354/> There are clear [[diastema (dentistry)|diastemata]] (gaps) between the upper canine (C1) and P2 and between P2 and P4, which are weaker or absent in ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'' and ''M.&nbsp;manavi''. Behind C1, the toothrows are about parallel, not divergent as in ''M.&nbsp;manavi''. The third upper molar (M3) is more compressed than in ''M.&nbsp;manavi'' and ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi''.<ref name=Gea356/> In some measurements of the skull and teeth, Anjouan specimens are larger than those from Madagascar.<ref name=Gea354/>

The animal has a [[karyotype]] of 46 [[chromosome]]s, with a total of 50 major arms on the [[autosome]]s (non-sex chromosomes). The karyotype is conserved among species of ''Miniopterus''; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'', the Malagasy ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'' and ''[[Miniopterus gleni|M.&nbsp;gleni]]'', and even the Asian ''[[Miniopterus fuliginosus|M.&nbsp;fuliginosus]]''.<ref>Richards et al., 2010, p. 649</ref>

==Distribution and ecology==
''Miniopterus aelleni'' is known to live from 4 to 225&nbsp;m (10 to 740&nbsp;ft) above sea level in northern and western Madagascar, at 1100&nbsp;m (3610&nbsp;ft) on Montagne d'Ambre, northern Madagascar, and from 220 to 690&nbsp;m (720 to 2260&nbsp;ft) on Anjouan in the nearby Comoros.<ref name=Gea353/> On Madagascar, it has been recorded in forest and caves in [[karst topography|karst]] areas; its distribution broadly overlaps that of ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'' and the two have been found in the same roost sites on several occasions.<ref>Goodman et al., 2009a, pp.&nbsp;358<U+2013>359</ref> On Anjouan, ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'' is less common than ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi''; there, it is known from four specimens only, all collected in 2006. These come from two nearby sites: a rocky area near a river and a disturbed forest.<ref>Goodman et al., 2010, p.&nbsp;131</ref> These animals, collected in late November, were in reproductive condition, with two females pregnant and a third [[lactating]]. ''M.&nbsp;griveaudi'' were reproductively active at the same time, suggesting that the reproductive seasons of the two do not differ significantly.<ref>Goodman et al., 2010, pp.&nbsp;131<U+2013>132</ref> Although some ecological and behavioral data has been published on "''Miniopterus manavi''", the recognition of several cryptic species within this group, more than one of which may occur in any given locality, renders the association of these data with any of the individual species uncertain;<ref>Goodman et al., 2009b, p. 31</ref> however, species of ''Miniopterus'' generally feed on insects.<ref>Nowak, 1994, p. 222</ref> Because ''M.&nbsp;aelleni'' is widespread and occurs in many [[protected area]]s on Madagascar, Goodman and colleagues inferred that its [[conservation status]] is secure.<ref name=Gea359>Goodman et al., 2009a, p.&nbsp;359</ref>
