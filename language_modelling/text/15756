Several causes have been proposed: [[Solar variation|cyclical lows in solar radiation]], heightened [[volcanic activity]], changes in the [[ocean circulation]], an inherent variability in global climate, or decreases in the human population. Lower CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheric concentrations found in Antarctic ice cores may have resulted from the colder global climate.

==Areas involved==
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report]] (TAR) of 2001 describes areas affected by the LIA:

{{quote |Evidence from mountain glaciers does suggest increased glaciation in a number of widely spread regions outside Europe prior to the 20th century, including [[Alaska]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Patagonia]].  However, the timing of maximum glacial advances in these regions differs considerably, suggesting that they may represent largely independent regional climate changes, not a globally-synchronous increased glaciation. Thus current evidence does not support globally synchronous periods of anomalous cold or warmth over this time frame, and the conventional terms of "Little Ice Age" and "[[Medieval Warm Period]]" appear to have limited utility in describing trends in hemispheric or global mean temperature changes in past centuries... [Viewed] hemispherically, the "Little Ice Age" can only be considered as a modest cooling of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] during this period of less than 1<U+00B0>C relative to late 20th century levels.<ref name= "Was there a <U+201C>Little Ice Age<U+201D> and a <U+201C>Medieval Warm Period<U+201D>?"/>}}

The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (AR4) of 2007 discusses more recent research, giving particular attention to the Medieval Warm Period. It states that "when viewed together, the currently available reconstructions indicate generally greater variability in centennial time scale trends over the last 1 kyr than was apparent in the TAR." Considering confidence limits, "The result is a picture of relatively cool conditions in the 17th and early 19th centuries and warmth in the 11th and early 15th centuries, but the warmest conditions are apparent in the 20th century. Given that the confidence levels surrounding all of the reconstructions are wide, virtually all reconstructions are effectively encompassed within the uncertainty previously indicated in the TAR. The major differences between the various proxy reconstructions relate to the magnitude of past cool excursions, principally during the 12th to 14th, 17th and 19th centuries."<ref name="AR4 2k years">[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch6s6-6.html AR4 WG1 Section 6.6: The Last 2,000 Years], 2007.</ref>

==Dating==
There is no agreed beginning year of the Little Ice Age,<ref name=PDJones>{{cite book|title=History and climate: memories of the future?|publisher=Springer|first=Philip D.|last=Jones|page=154|year=2001}}</ref><ref>According to JM Lamb of Cambridge University the little ice age was already underway in Canada and Switzerland and in the wider North Atlantic region in the 13th and 14th centuries</ref> although there is a frequently referenced series of events preceding the known climatic minima.  Starting in the 13th century, [[pack ice]] began advancing southwards in the [[North Atlantic]], as did glaciers in [[Greenland]]. There is anecdotal evidence of expanding [[glacier]]s almost worldwide.  Based on radiocarbon-dating of roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact collected from beneath ice caps on [[Baffin Island]] and [[Iceland]], Miller ''et al.'' (2012)<ref name="miller2012" /> state that summer cold and ice growth began abruptly between AD 1275 and 1300, followed by "a substantial intensification" from 1430 to 1455 AD.<ref name="scott" />

In contrast, a climate reconstruction based on glacial length<ref name="Worldwide glacier retreat">{{cite web| publisher=RealClimate | title=Worldwide glacier retreat |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=129 | accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref><ref name="Oerlemans2005">{{cite journal|last=Oerlemans|first=Johannes Hans Oerlemans|year=2005|title=Extracting a Climate Signal from 169 Glacier Records|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=308|pmid=15746388|issue=5722|pages=675<U+2013>7|url=http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/GEO518_Panel01_Oerlemans_2005.pdf|accessdate=2009-12-25|doi=10.1126/science.1107046|bibcode=2005Sci...308..675O}}</ref> shows no great variation from 1600 to 1850, though it shows strong retreat thereafter.

For this reason, any of several dates ranging over 400 years may indicate the beginning of the Little Ice Age:
* 1250 for when [[Atlantic]] [[pack ice]] began to grow
* 1275 to 1300 based on radiocarbon dating of plants killed by glaciation
* 1300 for when warm summers stopped being dependable in Northern Europe
* 1315 for the rains and [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>1317]]
* 1550 for theorized beginning of worldwide glacial expansion
* 1650 for the first climatic minimum.

The Little Ice Age ended in the latter half of the 19th century or early in the 20th century.<ref name="Hendy2002">{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1067693}}</ref><ref name="Ogilvie2001">{{cite doi|10.1023/A:1005625729889}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=INQUA | title=About INQUA:Quaternary Science (By S.C.

===Europe and North America===
The Little Ice Age brought colder winters to parts of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Farms and villages in the [[Swiss Alps]] were destroyed by encroaching glaciers during the mid-17th century.<ref name=aspects>{{cite book|title=Climate change: biological and human aspects|year=2007|author=Jonathan Cowie|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=164|isbn=978-0-521-69619-7}}</ref> Canals and rivers in [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]] were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter festivals.<ref name=aspects/> The first [[River Thames]] [[frost fair]] was in 1607 and the last in 1814; changes to the bridges and the addition of an [[Thames Embankment|embankment]] affected the river flow and depth, hence diminishing the possibility of freezes. Freezing of the [[Golden Horn]] and the southern section of the [[Bosphorus]] took place in 1622. In 1658, a Swedish army [[March across the Belts|marched across the Great Belt]] to Denmark to invade [[Copenhagen]]. The winter of 1794-1795 was particularly harsh, when the French invasion army under [[Pichegru]] could march on the frozen rivers of the Netherlands, while the Dutch fleet was fixed in the ice in Den Helder harbour. In the winter of 1780, [[New York Harbor]] froze, allowing people to walk from [[Manhattan]] to [[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]]. Sea ice surrounding [[Iceland]] extended for miles in every direction, closing harbors to shipping.

=== Depictions of winter in European painting ===
Burroughs analyzes the depiction of winter in paintings, as does [[Hans Neuberger]].<ref name=neu1>{{cite book|title=Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W2eDDMIeqpoC&pg=PA225 |first=Douglas |last=Macdougall |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2004|page=225 |isbn=0-520-24824-4}}</ref>  Burroughs asserts that this occurred almost entirely from 1565 to 1665 and was associated with the climatic decline from 1550 onwards. Before this, there were almost no depictions of winter in art, and he hypothesizes that the unusually harsh winter of 1565 inspired great artists to depict highly original images and that the decline in such paintings was a combination of the "theme" having been fully explored and mild winters interrupting the flow of painting.

The famous winter paintings by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] (e.g. [[:Image:Pieter Brueghel the Elder, Hunters in the Snow.jpg|''Hunters in the Snow'']]) all appear to have been painted in 1565. Snow also dominates many village-scapes by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], who lived from 1564 to 1638. Burroughs states that Pieter Brueghel the Younger "slavishly copied his father's designs. The derivative nature of so much of this work makes it difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the influence of the winters between 1570 and 1600..."
[[Image:Hendrick Avercamp - Winterlandschap met ijsvermaak.jpg|thumb|250px|''Winter landscape with iceskaters'', c.&nbsp;1608, [[Hendrick Avercamp]]]]
Dutch painting of the theme appears to begin with [[Hendrick Avercamp]] after the winter of 1608. There is then an interruption of the theme between 1627 and 1640, with a sudden return thereafter; this hints at a milder interlude in the 1630s. The 1640s to the 1660s cover the major period of Dutch winter painting, which fits with the known proportion of cold winters then. The final decline in winter painting, around 1660, does not coincide with an amelioration of the climate; Burroughs therefore cautions against trying to read too much into artistic output, since fashion plays a part. He notes that winter painting recurs around the 1780s and 1810s, which again marked a colder period.

Neuberger analyzed 12,000 paintings, held in American and European museums and dated between 1400 and 1967, for cloudiness and darkness.<ref name=neu1/> His 1970 publication shows an increase in such depictions that corresponds to the LIA,<ref name=neu1/> peaking between 1600 and 1649.<ref name="John1999">{{cite book|title=John Constable's skies: a fusion of art and science |author=John E.

== Southern Hemisphere ==
Since the discovery of the Little Ice Age, there have been doubts about whether it was a global phenomenon or a cold spell restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.

==Climate patterns==
In the North Atlantic, sediments accumulated since the end of the [[last ice age]], nearly 12,000 years ago, show regular increases in the amount of coarse sediment grains deposited from icebergs melting in the now open ocean, indicating a series of 1-2<U+00B0>C (2-4<U+00B0>F) <!-- Please, do not use AWB on temperatures --> cooling events recurring every 1,500 years or so.<ref>Bond et al., 1997</ref> The most recent of these cooling events was the Little Ice Age.

==Causes==
<!---
[[Image:Radiative-forcings.svg|thumb|300px|The relative effect of various forcings.]]
-->
Scientists have tentatively identified these possible causes of the Little Ice Age: [[Orbital forcing|orbital cycles]], decreased [[Solar variation|solar activity]], increased volcanic activity, altered [[ocean currents|ocean current flows]],<ref name="nature.com">http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n6/full/ncomms1901.html, Wanamaker et al.

Surface changes in the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the last millennium</ref> the inherent variability of global climate, and reforestation following decreases in the human population. The most recent study found that an especially massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1258, possibly of [[Mount Rinjani]], followed by three smaller ones in 1268, 1275, and 1284 that did not allow the climate to recover, may have caused the initial cooling, and that the 1452<U+2013>53 eruption of [[Kuwae]] in Vanuatu triggered a second pulse of cooling.<ref name="miller2012">Miller ''et al''. 2012.

===Orbital cycles===
{{main|Milankovich cycles}}
[[Orbital forcing]] due to cycles in the earth's orbit around the sun has, for the past 2,000 years, caused a long-term northern hemisphere cooling trend that continued through the Medieval period and the Little Ice Age.

===Solar activity===
{{Main|Solar variation}}

[[Image:Carbon-14 with activity labels.png|thumb|300px|Solar activity events recorded in radiocarbon]]
There is still a very poor understanding of the correlation between low [[sunspot]] activity and cooling temperatures.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11175 Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: Expanding the Concept and Addressing Uncertainties], National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., p. 29, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/sunspot_record_041027.html Sunspot Activity at 8,000-Year High] Space.com Astronomy October 27, 2004</ref>
During the period 1645<U+2013>1715, in the middle of the Little Ice Age, there was a period of low solar activity known as the [[Maunder Minimum]].

On the other hand, in a 2012 paper, Miller ''et al.'' link the Little Ice Age to an "unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading >60 Tg," and notes that "large changes in solar irradiance are not required."<ref name="miller2012" />

This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation, leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption. Also emitted by eruptions is [[sulfur]] in the form of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas. When this gas reaches the [[stratosphere]], it turns into [[sulfuric acid]] particles, which reflect the sun's rays, further reducing the amount of radiation reaching Earth's surface. The 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora|Tambora]] in [[Indonesia]] blanketed the atmosphere with ash; the following year, 1816, came to be known as the [[Year Without a Summer]], when [[frost]] and snow were reported in June and July in both [[New England]] and Northern Europe. Other volcanoes that erupted during the era and may have contributed to the cooling include [[Billy Mitchell (volcano)|Billy Mitchell]] (ca.&nbsp;1580), [[Mount Parker (Cotabato)|Mount Parker]] (1641), [[Long Island (Papua New Guinea)]] (ca.&nbsp;1660), and [[Huaynaputina]] (1600).<ref name=aspects/>

===Decreased human populations===

Some researchers have proposed that human influences on climate began earlier than is normally supposed and that major population declines in Eurasia and the Americas reduced this impact, leading to a cooling trend. [[William Ruddiman]] has proposed that somewhat reduced populations of Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East during and after the [[Black Death]] caused a decrease in agricultural activity. He suggests reforestation took place, allowing more carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere, which may have been a factor in the cooling noted during the Little Ice Age. Ruddiman further hypothesizes that a reduced population in the Americas after European contact in the early 16th century could have had a similar effect.<ref name="Ravilious2006">{{Cite news |last=Ravilious |first=Kate |title=Europe's chill linked to disease |date=2006-02-27 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4755328.stm}}</ref><ref name="Ruddiman2003">{{cite journal|last=Ruddiman|first=William F. |year=2003|title=The anthropogenic greenhouse era began thousands of years ago|journal=Climatic Change |volume=61|pages=261<U+2013>293|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Ruddiman2003.pdf|doi=10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa|issue=3}}</ref>  Faust, Gnecco, Mannstein and Stamm (2005)<ref name=ams1>{{cite web|title=Evidence for the Postconquest Demographic Collapse of the Americas in Historical {{CO2}} Levels|year=2006 |accessdate=2010-02-01|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]] through Allenpress.com|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FEI157.1}}</ref> and Nevle (2011)<ref>R.J.

===Inherent variability of climate===

Spontaneous fluctuations in global climate might explain past variability. However, it is very difficult to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be, since other forcings, as noted above, exist; and their magnitude may not be known either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere [[global climate model]]s. These have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero; but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. These variations may result from [[chaos theory|chaos]]-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two.<ref name=melissa>{{cite web|title=Global Warming in the Context of the Little Ice Age|publisher=[[Rutgers University]], originally published in [[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|author=Melissa Free, Alan Robock|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/FreeRobock1999JD900233.pdf|date=1999-08-27|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.<ref name=melissa/><ref name="B2006">{{cite web|title=The Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age and simulated climatic variability (abstract)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/677kx61w6812gx81/|date=2006-05-11|publisher=[[Climate Dynamics]], cited through [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|author=B.
