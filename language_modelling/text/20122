== History ==
[[Image:Luther's Ein Feste Burg.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Ein Feste Burg'' with Luther's signature]]
"A Mighty Fortress" is one of the best loved hymns of the [[Lutheran]] and [[Protestant]] traditions. It has been called the "Battle Hymn of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]" for the effect it had in increasing the support for the Reformers' cause. John Julian records four theories of its origin:<ref name=Julian/> 

* [[Heinrich Heine]]: it was sung by Luther and his companions as they entered [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on April 16, 1521 for the Diet;
* K.F.T. Schneider: it was a tribute to Luther's friend Leonhard Kaiser, who was executed as a Protestant martyr on August 16, 1527;
* [[Jean-Henri Merle d'Aubign<U+00E9>]]: it was sung by the German Lutheran princes as they entered Augsburg for the Diet in 1530 at which the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented; and
* the view that it was composed in connection with the Diet of Speyer (1529) at which the German Lutheran princes lodged their "protest" to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], who wanted to enforce his Edict of Worms (1521).

The earliest extant hymnal in which it appears is that of Andrew Rauscher (1531), but it is supposed to have been in Joseph Klug<U+2019>s Wittenberg hymnal of 1529, of which no copy exists. Its title was ''Der xxxxvi. Psalm. Deus noster refugium et virtus''.<ref name=Julian/>  Before that it is supposed to have appeared in the Hans Weiss Wittenberg hymnal of 1528, also lost.<ref>Jaroslav Pelikan and Helmut Lehmann, eds., ''Luther's Works'', 55 vols. (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House; Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1957-1986), 53:283.</ref> This evidence would support its being written in 1527-1529, since Luther's hymns were printed shortly after they were written.

Tradition states that King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] had it played as his forces went to battle in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The psalm had been translated into [[Swedish language|Swedish]] already in [[1536]]. Many centuries later, the song would also become an anthem of the early Swedish [[socialist]] movement.

It was first translated into English by [[Myles Coverdale]] in 1539 with the title, ''Oure God is a defence and towre''. The first English translation in "common usage" was ''God is our Refuge in Distress, Our strong Defence'' in J.C. Jacobi's <cite>Psal. Ger.<cite>, 1722, p. 83.<ref name=Julian/>

{{listen|filename=Ein' Feste Burg.ogg|title=Ein' Feste Burg sung in German|description=The [[German language|German]] text of ''Ein' Feste Burg'' (''A Mighty Fortress'') sung to the isometric, more widely known arrangement of its traditional melody.}}

Perhaps ironically, given its Reformation pedigree, it is now a suggested hymn for Catholic masses[http://www.canticanova.com/planning/year-c/pln4c_m.htm], appearing in the second edition of the ''Catholic Book of Worship'', published by the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]].

== Tune ==
[[Image:Luther's A Mighty Fortress isorythmic.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''A Mighty Fortress'', isometric tune]][[Image:Luther's A Mighty Fortress rythmic.jpg|250px|left|thumb|''A Mighty Fortress'', rhythmic tune]]
The first line in German is ''Ein<U+2019> feste Burg ist unser Gott''. Luther composed the melody for the hymn, which is called "Ein' Feste Burg" and is in hymn meter 87.87.55.56.7, denoted rhythmic tune as distinguished from the later isometric tune setting of the hymn, 87.87.66.66.7 meter. The isometric meter that is employed in the above media selection is more widely known and used in Christendom.<ref>Cf. The Commission on Worship of the Lutheran Church<U+2014>Missouri Synod, ''Lutheran Worship'', (St. Louis: CPH, 1982), 992, 997.</ref> In 1906 Edouard R<U+0153>hrich wrote, "The authentic form of this melody differs very much from that which one sings in most Protestant churches and figures in ([[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s] ''[[The Huguenots]]''. ... The original melody is ''extremely rhythmic'', by the way it bends to all the nuances of the text ..."<ref>E. R<U+0153>hrich, ''Les Origines du Choral Luth<U+00E9>rien''. (Paris: Librairie Fischbacher, 1906), 23 (italics original): "La forme authentique de cette m<U+00E9>lodie diff<U+00E8>re beaucoup de celle qu'on chante dans la plupart des <U+00C9>glises protestantes et qui figure dans les ''Huguenots''". ... La m<U+00E9>lodie originelle est ''puissamment rythm<U+00E9>e'', de mani<U+00E8>re <U+00E0> se plier <U+00E0> toutes les nuances du texte ..."</ref>

While in the 19th century [[musicologist]]s disputed Luther's authorship of the music to the hymn, that opinion has been modified by more recent research; it is now the consensus view of musical scholars that Luther did indeed compose the famous tune to go with the words.

== Arrangements ==
The tune has been used by numerous composers, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], as the source material for his [[Cantata No. 80 (Bach)|Cantata No. 80]]. It was given two settings in Bach's ''Choralges<U+00E4>nge'' (''Choral Hymns''). [[Felix Mendelssohn]] used it as the theme for the fourth and final movement of his [[Symphony No. 5 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No. 5]] (1830), which he named ''Reformation'' in honor of the [[Protestant Reformation]] started by Luther, [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] used it in his five-act grand opera ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836), and [[Richard Wagner]] used it as a "motive" in his ''Kaisermarsch'' (''Emperor's March''), which was composed to commemorate the return of [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm I]] from the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1871.<ref name=Julian/><ref name=Stulken/>

===English translations===
==== Pennsylvania Lutheran Church Book of 1868 ====

1. A mighty Fortress is our God,
:A trusty Shield and Weapon;
:He helps us free from every need
:That hath us now o'ertaken.
:The old evil Foe
:Now means deadly woe;
:Deep guile and great might
:Are his dread arms in fight;
:On earth is not his equal.

2. With might of ours can naught be done,
:Soon were our loss effected;
:But for us fights the Valiant One,
:Whom God Himself elected.
:Ask ye, Who is this?
:Jesus Christ it is.
:Of Sabaoth Lord,
:And there's none other God;
:He holds the field forever.

3. Though devils all the world should fill,
:All eager to devour us.
:We tremble not, we fear no ill,
:They shall not overpower us.
:This world's prince may still
:Scowl fierce as he will,
:He can harm us none,
:He's judged; the deed is done;
:One little word can fell him.

4. The Word they still shall let remain
:Nor any thanks have for it;
:He's by our side upon the plain
:With His good gifts and Spirit.
:And take they our life,
:Goods, fame, child and wife,
:Let these all be gone,
:They yet have nothing won;
:The Kingdom our remaineth.

==== Hedge ====
:A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;<br>Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:<br>For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;<br>His craft and power are great, and, armed with cruel hate,<br>On earth is not his equal.

:Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;<br>Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing:<br>Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He;<br>Lord Sabaoth, His Name, from age to age the same,<br>And He must win the battle.

:And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,<br>We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us:<br>The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;<br>His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,<br>One little word shall fell him.

:That word above all earthly powers, no thanks to them, abideth;<br>The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth:<br>Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;<br>The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still,<br>His kingdom is forever.
