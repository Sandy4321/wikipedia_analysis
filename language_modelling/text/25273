Cave described the band as a "weekend project", which later evolved into having support slots with [[The Maccabees]], [[Jamie T]] and [[Laura Marling]].<ref name="Guardian Fear of Flying">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/26/popandrock3|title=White Lies:Murder, madness and lots of black trousers|publisher=Chris Salmon, ''[[guardian.co.uk]]''|accessdaymonth=24 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> They released two [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] singles on [[Young and Lost Club]], "Routemaster/Round Three" on 7 August 2006 and "Three's a Crowd/Forget-Me-Nots" on 6 December 2006.<ref name="Young and Lost Club Store">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngandlostclub.com/shop/|title=YOUNG AND LOST CLUB - Shop - Records|publisher=Young and Lost Club|accessdaymonth=24 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Both vinyls were produced by former [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[The Smiths]] collaborator, [[Stephen Street]].<ref name="YALC0008">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngandlostclub.com/releases/release_detail.php?catalogue=YALC0008|title=Young and Lost Club - Releases - YALC0008|publisher=[[Young and Lost Club]] official website|accessdaymonth=12 December|accessyear=2008}}</ref><ref name="YALC0011">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngandlostclub.com/releases/release_detail.php?catalogue=YALC0011|title=Young and Lost Club - Releases - YALC0011|publisher=Young and Lost Club official website|accessdaymonth=12 December|accessyear=2008}}</ref> They went on to play the inaugural [[Underage Festival]] in [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]], [[England]] on 10 August 2007.<ref name="Virtual Festival Underage">{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/latest/news/3573|title=Festival News:New additions for Underage Festival|publisher=virtualfestivals.com|accessdaymonth=12 December|accessyear=2008}}</ref> They cited [[Talking Heads]] as a major influence.<ref name="BBC Interview FOF">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2006/12/04/londoncalling_fearofflying_feature.shtml|title=BBC - London - Radio - Fear Of Flying|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdaymonth=24 October|accessyear=2008}}</ref>
