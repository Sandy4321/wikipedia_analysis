==Club history==
Jack Nicklaus came to the Collier Township area in the late 1980s and decided to build a championship-caliber golf course in the Pittsburgh area.  Close to one million cubic yards of earth was moved to make way for the club, which opened for play in 1992.

From 1998 until 2005, the club was the host site of the annual [[Mellon Mario Lemieux Celebrity Invitational|Mario Lemieux Celebrity Invitational]], which was an event on the Celebrity Players Tour.  The tournament raised millions of dollars for cancer research over the eight years of the tournament.

==The course today==
The streets on the site of the club are named after many of the Jack Nicklaus-designed courses.

==Trivia==
* The ninth hole at the club was recently named one of the Bear's Best, a collection of the greatest holes designed by Jack Nicklaus.
