"'''Kill the DJ'''" is a song by the American [[punk rock]] band [[Green Day]]. It was released as the second single from the band's ninth [[studio album]], ''[[<U+00A1>Uno!]]'', on August 15, 2012. "Kill the DJ" takes influences from [[dance music]], something that Green Day have never done before, and has been compared to [[The Clash]] albums ''[[Sandinista!]]'' and ''[[Combat Rock]]'', as well as the band [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]].

==Background and release==

==Theme and composition==
"Kill the DJ" is a [[dance-punk]] song that frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] said is close to "straight-up [[dance music]]" and "four-on-the-floor rhythm", comparing it to [[The Clash]] album ''[[Sandinista!]]'', "[[Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll]]" by [[Ian Dury]] and "[[Genius of Love]]" by [[Tom Tom Club]].<ref name=rollingstone1st /><ref>{{cite web|last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/hear-green-days-dance-punk-kill-the-dj-in-spiky-studio-form |title=Hear Green Day's Dance-Punk 'Kill the DJ' in Spiky Studio Form &#124; SPIN &#124; SPIN Mix &#124; Songs |publisher=SPIN |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Talking about the style of the song, the band stated that, "We were trying to figure out how to make dance music without turning into a dance band".<ref name=rollingstone1st /> Meanwhile, Michael Roffman of [[Consequence of Sound]] has compared the song to the likes of the band [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]] and The Clash album ''[[Combat Rock]]'', calling it "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/08/new-music-green-day-kill-the-dj/ |title=New Music: Green Day <U+2013> <U+201C>Kill The DJ<U+201D> <U+00AB> Consequence of Sound |publisher=Consequenceofsound.net |date=2012-08-13 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref>

When asked that what the song is about by [[Rolling Stone magazine]], Armstrong cited that "static and noise<U+2026> Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left <U+2014> it doesn<U+2019>t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It<U+2019>s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and all you want to do is get more drunk".<ref name=rollingstone1st /><ref name="shoot the fucker down" /><ref name="describe vid EW">{{cite web|last=Rahman|first=Ray|title=Green Day crash a rave in their new 'Kill the DJ' video|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/09/05/green-day-kill-the-dj-video/|work=Music Mix|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> Todd Martens of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' cited that the word DJ in "Kill the DJ" doesn't actually signify a real DJ but some different figure. He compared "Kill the DJ" to a song which was on ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', "The Static Age" which was "a foaming-at-the-mouth guitar rant that everyone -- pundits, politicians, celebrities -- should stop babbling and shut up." and stated that, "[the song] drops some cursory nods to war and religion in the opening bars, but soon brings the imagery of waterboarding and torture straight into the dance club."<ref name="shoot the fucker down">{{cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|title=The problems with Green Day's 'Kill the DJ'|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-the-problems-with-green-days-kill-the-dj-20120904,0,5160209.story|accessdate=9 September 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=4 September 2012}}</ref>

==Artwork==
The band first revealed the artwork of "Kill the DJ" on July 30 2012, in a post made by the band on their official website.<ref name="coverartgdc">{{cite web|title=Kill the DJ - Artwork|url=http://www.greenday.com/news/kill-dj-artwork-26751|work=greenday.com|publisher=Green Day|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> The cover art of the song follows the style of those of ''<U+00A1>Uno!'', ''<U+00A1>Dos!'', and ''<U+00A1>Tr<U+00E9>!''.<ref name=coverartgdc /> It features a white colored stereo in the middle with two skull heads on the left and right side of the stereo as speakers. The skulls are in black color, while the crosses made on their eyes are in pink; similar style of artwork had been used in ''<U+00A1>Uno!'', ''<U+00A1>Dos!'', and ''<U+00A1>Tr<U+00E9>!''. "Green Day" is written in capital and italic letters at top of the stereo in neon green color and "Kill the DJ" is written below the stereo in white color.<ref name=coverartgdc /> "Kill the DJ", in white color, is against the background of the floor which shows contrast between dark-pink and black shades and "Green Day" written in neon green color, is against the background of shades of blue and black stripes; similar to this was the artwork of "Oh Love".<ref name=coverartgdc /><ref>{{cite web|last=Maloy|first=Sarah|title=Green Day Debuts 'Oh Love' Single: Listen|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/green-day-debuts-oh-love-single-listen-1007586772.story#/news/green-day-debuts-oh-love-single-listen-1007586772.story|work=[[Billboard (magazine)]]|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=18 July, 2012}}</ref>

==Music video==
The music video for "Kill the DJ" was directed by Samuel Bayer, a long-time collaborator with Green Day, who also directed the music videos of all ''[[American Idiot]]'' singles, and the band's previous single "[[Oh Love]]".<ref name="describe vid EW" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Sarah Maloy |url=http://www.billboard.com/column/viralvideos/green-day-parties-with-models-in-oh-love-1007844552.story#/column/viralvideos/green-day-parties-with-models-in-oh-love-1007844552.story |title=Green Day Parties With Models in 'Oh Love' Video: Watch - Viral Videos |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> The band announced via twitter that they would be releasing a video for the song soon and posted a link to the teaser video of the song posted on Warner Records' official YouTube channel on 29 August 2012. Before revealing the video, the teaser video featured mix scenes from the video while playing the music which comes at the end of the song. Eventually, the official music video premiered through Warner Records' official YouTube channel on September 4, 2012.

The video starts off with an black-and-white clip of the band riding motorcycles through a desert and finds their way into a nightclub. The band is later seen walking through the club while others were dancing around.<ref name="describe vid EW" /> The band performs the song inside the club, while an event of violence bursts out between two girls and bottles get broken, attacks on necks, punches and fight occurs.<ref name="describe vid EW" /> Coming towards the end, both of them have gone through a "bloodbath" and are seen with blood on their faces and cloths, while, they re-start dancing and the video ends.<ref name=bloodbath>{{cite web|title=Green Day Have Bloody Fun in 'Kill the DJ'|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/green-day-has-bloody-fun-in-kill-the-dj-20120904|work=|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> Between various scenes of violence and partying, Green Day is featured playing in an empty club.<ref name="describe vid EW" />

==Critical reception==
Hive Magazine describes "Kill the DJ" as "a fun and funky track that shows us a bright new direction for the band, with a catchy melody and an even more infectious chorus". They also state "The band have proven time and again, even back in the days of ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' and ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'', that they<U+2019>re quite capable of slipping into different genres and experimenting with different sounds to great success".<ref>{{cite web|last=Jack |first=Brad |url=http://www.hivemag.com/green-day-kill-the-d-j-single-review/ |title=Green Day <U+2018>Kill The D.J.<U+2019> Single Review |publisher=Hive Magazine |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Gigwise, talking about the theme of the video stated that, "Clearly, this is not how most Green Day shows turn out though, as those who attended the band's brilliant Reading Festival set in August will testify. Things didn't get any more violent than your standard mosh pit there".<ref>{{cite web|last=Renshaw|first=David|title=GREEN DAY CAUSE CAT FIGHT, RIDE BIKES IN 'KILL THE DJ' VIDEO|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/76025/green-day-cause-cat-fight-ride-bikes-in-kill-the-dj-video|publisher=Gigwise|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> David Greenwald of [[Billboard magazine]] describes the track to be "profanity-laced and Clash-channeling".<ref name="kill the billboard">{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=David|title=Green Day Hit the Road & the Club in 'Kill the DJ' Video: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/green-day-hit-the-road-the-club-in-kill-1007929552.story#/news/green-day-hit-the-road-the-club-in-kill-1007929552.story|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> Zara Golden of [[Vh1]], talking about the video, states, "The hit is only a symbolic one, though, and the only real violence to be had here is a slaying guitar riff. Rather, this is an assault against the dubbed-out sound that seems to be dominating today<U+2019>s air waves, Green Day<U+2019>s own and only pretend bloody dubstep demolition".<ref name=vhi1>{{cite web|last=Golden|first=Zara|title=There Will Be Blood In Green Day<U+2019>s <U+201C>Kill The DJ<U+201D> Video|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-09-04/there-will-be-blood-in-green-days-kill-the-dj-video/|publisher=Vh1|accessdate=9 September 2012}}</ref> Todd Martens of ''LA Times'', criticizing the single stated that, "It's all played rather straight. 'I'll pick up what's left in the club,' Armstrong sings suspiciously, and the video released Tuesday doesn't do much to present the song as a statement."<ref name="shoot the fucker down" />
