[[Captain (United Kingdom)|Captain]] '''Sir Richard Francis Burton''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] [[Royal Geographic Society|FRGS]] (19 March 1821 &ndash; 20 October 1890) was an English [[explorer]], [[translator]], writer, [[soldier]], [[orientalist]], [[ethnologist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], poet, [[hypnotism|hypnotist]], [[fencing|fencer]] and [[diplomat]]. He was known for his travels and explorations within Asia and Africa as well as his extraordinary knowledge of languages and cultures. According to one count, he spoke 29 European, Asian, and African languages.<ref>Lovell (1998), p. xvii.</ref>

Burton's best-known achievements include traveling in disguise to [[Mecca]], making an unexpurgated translation of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|The Book of One Thousand Nights and A Night]]'' (the collection is more commonly called ''The Arabian Nights'' in English because of [[Andrew Lang]]'s abridgement) and the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' and journeying with [[John Hanning Speke]] as the first Europeans, guided by Omani merchants who traded in the region, to visit the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] of Africa in search of the source of the [[Nile river|Nile]]. He was a prolific author and wrote numerous books and scholarly articles about subjects including travel, fencing and ethnography.

He was a captain in the army of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] serving in India (and later, briefly, in the [[Crimean War]]). Following this he was engaged by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] to explore the east coast of Africa and led an expedition guided by the locals which discovered [[Lake Tanganyika]]. In later life he served as British [[consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], [[Damascus]] and, finally, [[Trieste]]. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and was awarded a [[knighthood]] ([[Order of St Michael and St George#KCMG|KCMG]]) in 1886.

==Early life and education (1822<U+2013>1841)==
Burton was born in [[Torquay]], [[Devon]], at 21:30 on 19 March 1821; in his autobiography, he erroneously claimed to have been born in the family home at Barham House in [[Elstree]] in [[Hertfordshire]]<ref>Lovell (1998), p. 1.</ref><ref>Wright (1905), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter1.html#section1 vol. 1, p. 37].</ref>. He was baptised on 2 September 1821 at Elstree Church in [[Borehamwood]], Hertfordshire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Page|first=William|title=A History of the County of Hertford|publisher=Constable|date=1908|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43292&strquery=elstree|pages=vol. 2, pp. 349<U+2013>351|nopp=true}}</ref> His father, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Joseph Netterville Burton, 36th Regiment, was an Irish-born [[British army]] officer of Anglo-Irish extraction, the son of the Rev. Edward Burton, a [[Church of Ireland]] clergyman from [[Westmorland]], England, and an Irish mother; his mother, Martha Baker, was the heiress of a wealthy [[Hertfordshire]] [[squire]], Richard Baker. Burton had two siblings, Maria Katherine Elizabeth Burton and Edward Joseph Netterville Burton, born in 1823 and 1824, respectively.<ref>Wright (1905), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter1.html#section2 vol. 1, p. 38].</ref> 

Burton's family travelled considerably during his childhood. In 1825, his family moved to [[Tours]], France. Burton's early education was provided by various tutors employed by his parents. He first began a formal education in 1829 at a preparatory school on [[Richmond Green]] in [[Richmond, London]] run by Rev. Charles Delafosse.<ref>Wright (1905), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter1.html#section4 vol. 1, p. 52].</ref> Over the next few years, his family travelled between England, France and Italy. Burton showed an early gift for languages and quickly learned French, Italian and [[Latin]], as well as several dialects, such as [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]. During his youth, he was rumoured to have carried on an affair with a young [[Roma people|Roma]] (Gypsy) woman, even learning the rudiments of her language.  The peregrinations of his youth may have encouraged Burton to regard himself as an outsider for much of his life. As he put it, "Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expect applause..."<ref> ''The Kas<U+00EE>dah Of H<U+00E2>j<U+00EE> Abd<U+00FB> El-Yezd<U+00EE>'' by Richard F. Burton (1870).</ref>

Richard Francis matriculated at [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] on 19 Nov. 1840. Before getting rooms in college, he lived for a short time in the house of Dr. [[William Alexander Greenhill]], then physician to the Radcliffe Infirmary. Here he met [[John Henry Newman]], whose churchwarden Dr. Greenhill was. Despite his intelligence and ability, Richard Francis soon antagonized his teachers and peers. During his first term, he is said to have challenged another student to a [[duel]] after the latter mocked Burton's moustache. Burton continued to gratify his love of languages by studying [[Arabic language|Arabic]]; he also spent his time learning [[falconry]] and fencing. In 1842, he attended a [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] in deliberate violation of college rules and subsequently dared to tell the college authorities that students should be allowed to attend such events. Hoping to be merely "[[rustication (academia)|rusticated]]"<U+2014>that is, suspended with the possibility of reinstatement, the punishment of some less provocative students who had visited the steeplechase&mdash; he was instead permanently expelled from Trinity College. In a final jab at the environment he had come to despise, Burton reportedly trampled the College's flower beds with his horse and carriage while departing Oxford.

==Army career (1842<U+2013>1853)== 
In his own words "fit for nothing but to be shot at for six pence a day",<ref>''Falconry In The Valley of the Indus'', Richard F. Burton (John Van Voorst 1852) page 93.</ref> Burton enlisted in the army of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] at the behest of his ex-college classmates who were already members. He hoped to fight in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|first Afghan war]] but the conflict was over before he arrived in India. He was posted to the 18th Bombay Native Infantry based in [[Gujarat]] and under the command of General Sir [[Charles James Napier]]. While in India he became a proficient speaker of [[Hindustani]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Panjabi language|Panjabi]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] as well as [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]]. His studies of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] culture had progressed to such an extent that "my Hindu teacher officially allowed me to wear the Janeu ([[Guru Nanak and the Sacred Thread|Brahmanical Thread]])"<ref>''The Life of Captain Sir Richard F. Burton KCMG, FRGS'', Isabel Burton (Chapman and Hall 1893), Vol. 1, page 123.</ref> although the truth of this has been questioned since it would usually have required long study, fasting and a partial shaving of the head. Burton's interest (and active participation) in [[Indian culture|the cultures]] and [[religion in India|religions of India]] was considered peculiar by some of his fellow soldiers who accused him of "going native" and called him "the White Nigger". Burton had many peculiar habits that set him apart from other soldiers. While in the army, he kept a large [[menagerie]] of tame [[monkey]]s in the hopes of [[Animal communication|learning their language]].<ref>''A Rage to Live'' page 58.</ref>  He also earned the name [[#Scandals in the life of Richard Burton|"Ruffian Dick"]] for his "demonic ferocity as a fighter and because he had fought in single combat more enemies than perhaps any other man of his time."<ref>Wright (1905), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter6.html#section26 vol. 1, pp. 119<U+2013>120].</ref>

He was appointed to the [[Sindh]] survey, where he learned to use the measuring equipment that would later be useful in his career as an explorer. At this time he began to travel in [[disguise]]. He adopted the alias of Mirza Abdullah and often fooled local people and fellow officers into failing to recognise him. It was at this point that he began to work as an agent for Napier and, although details of exactly what this work entailed are not known, it is known that he participated in an undercover investigation of a [[brothel]] in [[Karachi]] said to be frequented by English soldiers where the prostitutes were young boys. His life-long interest in sexual practices led him to produce a detailed report which was later to cause trouble for Burton when subsequent readers of the report (which Burton had been assured would be kept secret) came to believe that Burton had, himself, participated in some of the practices described within his writing.

In March 1849 he returned to Europe on sick leave. In 1850 he wrote his first book ''Goa and the Blue Mountains'', a guide to the [[Goa]] region. He travelled to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] to visit the fencing school there and it was there where he first encountered his future wife [[Isabel Burton|Isabel Arundell]], a young [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] woman from a good family.

==First explorations and journey to Mecca (1851<U+2013>1853)==
[[Image:Richardburtonarabicdress.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Burton in Arabic dress.]]
Motivated by his love of adventure, Burton got the approval of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for an exploration of the area and he gained permission from the Board of Directors of the [[British East India Company]] to take leave from the army.  His seven years in India gave Burton a familiarity with the customs and behaviour of [[Islam|Muslims]] and prepared him to attempt a [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and, in this case, [[Medina]]). It was this journey, undertaken in 1853, which first made Burton famous. He had planned it whilst travelling disguised among the Muslims of Sindh, and had laboriously prepared for the ordeal by study and practice (including being [[circumcision|circumcised]] to further lower the risk of being discovered). 

Although Burton was not the first non-Muslim European to make the ''Hajj'' ([[Ludovico di Barthema]] in 1503 is believed to hold that distinction<ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/varthema.html Discoverers Web: Ludovico di Varthema]</ref>), his pilgrimage is the most famous and the best documented of the time. He adopted various disguises including that of a [[Pashtun]] to account for any oddities in speech, but he still had to demonstrate an understanding of intricate Islamic [[ritual]], and a familiarity with the minutiae of Eastern manners and etiquette. Burton's trek to Mecca was quite dangerous and his caravan was attacked by bandits (a common experience at the time). As he put it, although "...neither [[Quran|Koran]] or [[Sultan]] enjoin the death of Jew or Christian intruding within the columns that note the sanctuary limits, nothing could save a European detected by the populace, or one who after pilgrimage declared himself an unbeliever."<ref>''Selected Papers on Anthropology, Travel, and Exploration'' by Richard Burton, edited by Norman M. Penzer (London, A. M. Philpot 1924) p. 30.</ref> The pilgrimage entitled him to the title of [[Hajji]] and to wear green head wrap.  Burton's own account of his journey is given in ''A Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to Al-Medinah and Meccah'' (1855).

Some members of his entourage suspected there was more to Burton than met the eye. He came close to being discovered one night when he lifted his robe to urinate, rather than squatting as an Arab would. He thought he was unseen, but the youngest member of his group happened to see him. The lad accused him of being an imposter, but let Burton convince him to keep his doubts to himself.<ref>''A Rage to Live'' by Mary S. Lovell, (Abacus 1998) page 142</ref>

When Burton returned to the British Army he sat for examination as an Arab linguist - and failed.<ref>ibid, page 154</ref>

==Early explorations (1854<U+2013>1855)==
Following his return to Cairo from Mecca, Burton sailed to India to rejoin his regiment.  In March 1854, he transferred to the political department of the East India Company and went to Aden on the Arabian Peninsula in order to prepare for a new expedition, supported by the Royal Geographical Society, to explore the interior of the Somali Country and beyond, where Burton hoped to discover the large lakes he had heard about from Arab travelers.  It was in Aden in September of this year that he first met Captain (then Lieutenant) [[John Hanning Speke]] who would accompany him on his most famous exploration.  Burton undertook the first part of the trip alone.  He made an expedition to [[Harar]] (in present day Ethiopia), which no European had entered (indeed there was a prophecy that the city would decline if a Christian was admitted inside).  
This leg of the expedition lasted three months, although much of the time was spent in the port of [[Zeila]], where Burton, once again in disguise, awaited word that the road to Harar was safe. Burton not only travelled to Harar but also was introduced to the Emir and stayed in the city for ten days, officially a guest of the Emir but in reality his prisoner.  The journey back was plagued by lack of supplies, and Burton wrote that he would have died of thirst had he not seen desert birds and realised they would be near water.

Following this adventure, he prepared to set out for the interior accompanied by Lieutenant Speke, Lieutenant G. E. Herne and Lieutenant William Stroyan and a number of Africans employed as bearers.  However, before the expedition was able to leave camp, his party was attacked by a group of Somali tribesmen (the officers estimated the number of attackers at 200).  In the ensuing fight, Stroyan was killed and Speke was captured and wounded in eleven places before he managed to escape.  Burton was impaled with a javelin, the point entering one cheek and exiting the other. This wound left a notable scar that can be easily seen on portraits and photographs.  He was forced to make his escape with the weapon still transfixing his head.  However, the failure of this expedition was viewed harshly by the authorities, and a two-year investigation was set up to determine to what extent Burton was culpable for this disaster.  While he was largely cleared of any blame, this did not help his career.  He describes the harrowing attack in ''First Footsteps in East Africa'' (1856).

In 1855, Burton rejoined the army and travelled to the [[Crimea]] hoping to see active service in the [[Crimean War]]. He served on the staff of ''Beatson's Horse'' a corps of [[Bashi-bazouk]]s, local fighters under the command of General Beatson, in the [[Dardanelles]].  The corps was disbanded following a "mutiny" after they refused to obey orders and Burton's name was mentioned (to his detriment) in the subsequent inquiry.

==Exploring the lakes of central Africa (1856<U+2013>1860)==
[[Image:BurtonExploration.png|thumb|450px|Routes taken by the expeditions of Burton and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke]] (1857<U+2013>1858) and [[John Hanning Speke|Speke]] and [[James Augustus Grant|Grant]] (1863).]]

In 1856 the [[Royal Geographical Society]] funded another expedition in which Burton set off from [[Zanzibar]] to explore an "inland sea" that had been described by Arab traders and slavers. His mission was to study local tribes and to find out what exports might be possible from the region. It was hoped that the expedition might lead to the discovery of the source of the [[River Nile]], although this was not an explicit aim.  Burton had been told that only a fool would say his expedition aimed to find the source of the Nile because anything short of that would be regarded as a failure.

Before leaving for Africa, Burton became secretly engaged to [[Isabel Burton|Isabel Arundell]]. Her family, particularly her mother, would not allow a marriage since Burton was not a Catholic and was not wealthy, although in time the relationship would become tolerated.

Speke again accompanied him and on the 27 June 1857 they set out from the east coast of Africa heading west in search of the lake or lakes. They were helped greatly by the Omani Arabs who lived and traded in the region. They followed the traditional caravan routes, hiring the professional porters and guides, who had been making similar treks for years. From the start the outward journey was beset with problems such as recruiting reliable bearers and the defalcation of equipment and supplies by deserting expedition members. 
Both men were beset by a variety of tropical diseases on the journey. Speke was rendered blind for some of the journey and deaf in one ear (due to an infection caused by attempts to remove a beetle). Burton was unable to walk for some of the journey and had to be carried by the bearers.

The expedition arrived at [[Lake Tanganyika]] in February 1858. Burton was awestruck by the sight of the magnificent lake, but Speke, who had been temporarily blinded by a disease, was unable to see the body of water. By this point much of their surveying equipment was lost, ruined, or stolen, and they were unable to complete surveys of the area as well as they wished. Burton was again taken ill on the return journey and Speke continued exploring without him, making a journey to the north and eventually locating the great [[Lake Victoria]], or Victoria Nyanza. Lacking supplies and proper instruments Speke was unable to survey the area properly but was privately convinced that it was the long sought source of the Nile. Burton's description of the journey is given in ''Lake Regions of Equatorial Africa'' (1860).  Speke gave his own account in ''The Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile'' (1863).<ref>[http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Speke/nile.htm The Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile] by John Hanning Speke at www.wollamshram.ca (URL accessed 10 April 2006)</ref>

Both Burton and Speke were in extremely poor health after the journey and returned home separately. As usual Burton kept very detailed notes, not just on the geography but also on the languages, customs and even sexual habits of the people he encountered. Although it was Burton's last great expedition his geographical and cultural notes were to prove invaluable for subsequent explorations by Speke and [[James Augustus Grant]], Sir [[Samuel Baker]], [[David Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley]]. Speke and Grant's (1863) exploration began on the east coast near Zanzibar again and went around the west side of Lake Victoria to [[Lake Albert]] and finally returning in triumph via the Nile River. However, crucially, they had lost track of the river's course between Lake Victoria and Albert. This left Burton, and others, unsatisfied that the source of the Nile was conclusively proven.  

===Burton and Speke===
[[Image:lake tanganyika.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Tanganyika photographed from orbit. Burton was the first European to see the lake.]] 
Burton and Speke's exploration to Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria was, arguably, his most celebrated exploration but what followed was a prolonged public quarrel between the two men, which severely damaged Burton's reputation. From surviving letters it seems that Speke already mistrusted and disliked Burton before the start of their second expedition. There are several reasons why they became estranged. It seems obvious that the two men were very different in character, with Speke being more in tune with the prevailing [[Victorian morality|morality of Victorian England]] and imperialistic attitude to other cultures. There was obviously a great element of professional rivalry. Some biographers have suggested that friends of Speke (particularly [[Laurence Oliphant]]) stirred up trouble between the two. It also seems that Speke resented Burton's position as expedition leader and claimed that this leadership was nominal only and that Burton was an invalid for most of the second expedition. There were problems with debts run up by the expedition that were left unpaid when they left Africa. Speke claimed that Burton had sole responsibility for these debts. Finally, there was the issue of the source of the Nile, perhaps the greatest prize of its day to explorers. It is now known that [[Lake Victoria]] is a source, but at the time the issue was controversial. Speke's expedition there was undertaken without Burton (who was incapacitated by several illnesses at the time) and his survey of the area was, by necessity, rudimentary, leaving the issue unresolved. Burton (and indeed many eminent explorers such as [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]]) were very sceptical that the lake was the genuine source.

After the expedition, the two men travelled home to England separately with Speke arriving in London first.  Despite an agreement between them that they would give their first public speech together, Speke gave a lecture at the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in which he made the claim that his discovery, Lake Victoria, was the source of the Nile. When Burton arrived in London he found Speke being lionised, and felt his own role was being considered as that of sickly companion. Furthermore, Speke was organising other expeditions to the region and clearly had no plans to include Burton.

In the subsequent months, Speke did much to attempt to harm Burton's reputation, even going so far as to claim that Burton had tried to poison him during the expedition. Meanwhile Burton spoke out against Speke's claim to have discovered the source of the Nile, saying that the evidence was inconclusive and the measurements made by Speke were inaccurate. It is notable that in Speke's expedition with Grant he made Grant sign a statement saying, amongst other things, "I renounce all my rights to publishing... my own account [of the expedition] until approved of by Captain Speke or the R. G. S. (Royal Geographical Society)".<ref>''A Rage to Live'' page 341.</ref>

Speke and Grant undertook a second expedition to prove that Lake Victoria was the true source of the Nile, but again, problems with surveying and measurement meant not everybody was satisfied the issue had been resolved. On 16 September 1864 Burton and Speke were due to debate the issue of the source of the Nile in front of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at that body's annual meeting in Bath. Burton was regarded as the superior public speaker and scholar and was likely to get the better of such a debate. However, the previous day Speke died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while hunting on a relative's nearby estate. There were no witnesses to the shooting and it has been speculated by some, without any evidence, that Speke committed suicide; however, the coroner declared it to be a hunting accident. Burton was at the debate hall in Bath waiting to give his presentation when the news of Speke's death arrived and, considerably shaken, he elected not to give his planned talk.

==Diplomatic service, scholarship, and death (1861<U+2013>1890)==

[[Image:burtontomb1.jpg|thumb|right|Richard and Isabel Burton's tomb at Mortlake, Surrey.]]
[[Image:burtontomb2.jpg|thumb|right|Close up of inscription on the tomb.]]

In January 1861, Richard and Isabel married in a quiet Catholic ceremony although he did not adopt the Catholic faith at this time. Shortly after this, the couple were forced to spend some time apart when he formally entered the Foreign Service as [[consul (representative)|consul]] at [[Bioko|Fernando Po]], the modern island of Bioko in [[Equatorial Guinea]].  This was not a prestigious appointment; because the climate was considered extremely unhealthy for Europeans, Isabel could not accompany him. Burton spent much of this time exploring the coast of [[West Africa]]. 

The couple were reunited in 1865 when Burton was transferred to [[Santos (S<U+00E3>o Paulo)|Santos]] in [[Brazil]]. Once there, Burton traveled through Brazil's central highlands, canoeing down the [[Sao Francisco River|Sao Francisco river]] from its source to the falls of [[Paulo Afonso]].<ref>Wright (1905), [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter13.html#section54 vol. 1, p. 200].</ref>

In 1869 he was made consul in [[Damascus]], an ideal post for someone with Burton's knowledge of the region and customs. However, Burton made many enemies during his time there. He managed to antagonize much of the [[Jew]]ish population of the area because of a dispute concerning money lending. It had been the practice for the British consulate to take action against those who defaulted on loans but Burton saw no reason to continue this practice and this caused a great deal of hostility. 
He and Isabel greatly enjoyed their time there and befriended [[Lady Jane Digby]], the well-known adventurer, and [[Abd al-Kader]] al-Jazairi, a prominent leader of the Algerian revolution then living in exile.

However, the area was in some turmoil at the time with considerable tensions between the Christian, Jewish and Muslim populations. Burton did his best to keep the peace and resolve the situation but this sometimes led him into trouble. On one occasion, he claims to have escaped an attack by hundreds of armed horsemen and camel riders sent by Mohammed Rashid Pasha, the Governor of Syria. He wrote "I have never been so flattered in my life than to think it would take three hundred men to kill me."<ref> ''The Life of Captain Sir Richard F. Burton KCMG, FRGS'' Vol. 1 page 517.</ref>

In addition to these incidents, there were a number of people who disliked Burton and wished him removed from such a sensitive position. Eventually, to resolve the situation, Burton was transferred to [[Trieste]] (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]) during 1871. Burton was never particularly content with this post but it required little work and allowed him the freedom to write and travel.

In 1863 Burton co-founded the ''[[Anthropological Society of London]]'' with Dr. James Hunt. In Burton's own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical ''Anthropologia'') was "to supply travellers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters". On 5 February 1886 he was awarded a knighthood ([[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]]) by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

He wrote a number of travel books in this period that were not particularly well received. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqu<U+00E9> or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the Kama Shastra society. These books include ''The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana'' (1883) (popularly known as the [[Kama Sutra]]), ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885) (popularly known as [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights]]), ''The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi'' (1886) and ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'' (sixteen volumes 1886&ndash; 1898).

Published in this period, but composed on his return journey from Mecca, ''[[The Kasidah]]''<ref> ''The Kas<U+00EE>dah Of H<U+00E2>j<U+00EE> Abd<U+00FB> El-Yezd<U+00EE>'' by Richard F. Burton (1870).</ref> has been cited as evidence of Burton's status as a [[Sufi]]. The poem (and Burton's notes and commentary on it) contain layers of Sufic meaning, and seem to have been designed to project Sufi teaching in the West.<ref> ''The Sufis'' by Idries Shah (1964) </ref> "Do what thy manhood bids thee do/ from none but self expect applause;/ He noblest lives and noblest dies/ who makes and keeps his self-made laws" is [[The Kasidah]]'s most oft-quoted passage.

Other works of note include a collection of Hindu tales, ''Vikram and the Vampire'' (1870); and his uncompleted history of [[swordsmanship]], ''The Book of the Sword'' (1884). He also translated ''[[The Lusiads]]'', the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] national epic by [[Lu<U+00ED>s de Cam<U+00F5>es]], in 1880 and wrote a sympathetic [[biography]] of the poet and adventurer the next year. The book ''The Jew, the Gipsy and el Islam'' was published posthumously in 1898 and was controversial since it was virulently [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] in tone and asserted the existence of [[Blood libel against Jews|Jewish human sacrifices]]. (Burton's investigations into this had provoked hostility from the Jewish population in Damascus, see [[Damascus affair]].  The manuscript of the book included an appendix discussing the topic in more detail, but by the decision of his widow it was not included in the book when published).

Burton died in Trieste early on the morning of 20 October 1890 of a heart attack.  His wife Isabel persuaded a priest to perform the last rites, although Burton was not a Catholic and this action later caused a rift between Isabel and some of Burton's friends. It has been suggested that the death occurred very late on 19 October and that Burton was already dead by the time the last rites were administered.

Isabel never recovered from the loss. After his death she burned many of her husband's papers, including journals and a planned new translation of ''The Perfumed Garden'' to be called ''The Scented Garden'', for which she had been offered six thousand guineas and which she regarded as his "magnum opus." She believed she was acting to protect her husband's reputation, and imagined she was instructed to burn the manuscript of ''The Scented Garden'' by his spirit, but her actions have been widely condemned.<ref>Wright (1906), [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/chapter38.html vol. 2, pp. 252<U+2013>254].</ref>

Isabel wrote a biography in praise of her husband.<ref>''The Life of Captain Sir Richard F. Burton KCMG, FRGS''</ref> The couple are buried in a remarkable tomb in the shape of a Bedouin tent at [[Mortlake]] in southwest [[London]].<ref>[http://www.burtonfund.org/ Burton Tomb Restoration Fund], www.burtonfund.org (URL accessed 10 April 2006)</ref> 

===The Kama Shastra Society===
Burton had long had an interest in sexuality and erotic literature. However, the Obscene Publications Act of 1857 had resulted in many jail sentences for publishers, with prosecutions being brought by the Society for the Suppression of Vice (Burton referred to the society and those who shared its views as ''[[Mrs Grundy]]''). A way around this was the private circulation of books amongst the members of a society. For this reason Burton, together with [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]], created the Kama Shastra Society to print and circulate books that would be illegal to publish in public.

One of the most celebrated of all his books is his translation of the ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night'' (more commonly known in English as ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Arabian Nights]]'' because of [[Andrew Lang]]'s abridged collection) in [[List of stories within The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|ten volumes]], (1885) with six further volumes being added later. The volumes were printed by the Kama Shashtra Society in a subscribers-only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form. The stories collected were often sexual in content and were considered [[pornography]] at the time of publication. In particular, the ''Terminal Essay'' of the ''Nights'' was one of the first English language texts to dare address the practice of [[pederasty]] which he postulated was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the "[[Sotadic zone]]." Rumors about Burton<U+2019>s own sexuality were already circulating and were further incited by this work.

Perhaps Burton's best-known book is his translation of ''[[Kama Sutra|The Kama Sutra]]''. In fact, it is not really true that he was the translator since the original manuscript was in ancient [[Sanskrit]] which he could not read. However, he collaborated with [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] on the work and provided translations from other manuscripts of later translations. The Kama Shashtra Society first printed the book in 1883 and numerous editions of the Burton translation are in print to this day.

His English translation from a French edition of the Arabic erotic guide ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]'' was printed as ''The Perfumed Garden of the Cheikh Nefzaoui: A Manual of Arabian Erotology'' (1886).  After Richard's death [[Isabel Burton|Isabel]] burnt many of his papers, including a manuscript of a subsequent translation, ''The Scented Garden'', containing the final chapter of the work, on [[pederasty]].  It is interesting to note that Burton all along intended for this translation to be published after his death, to provide a competence for his widow,<ref>[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/isabel/romance/chapter38.html The Romance of Lady Isabel Burton (chapter 38)] by Isabel Burton (1897) (URL accessed 12 June 2006)</ref> and also, as a final gesture of defiance against Victorian society.

==Scandals in the life of Richard Burton == 
[[Image:ST-Burton.jpg|thumb|right|Burton pictured later in life.]]

First, Burton's writing was unusually open and frank about his interest in [[sex]] and [[human sexuality|sexuality]].  His travel writing is often full of details about the sexual lives of the inhabitants of areas he travelled through.  Burton's interest in sexuality led him to make measurements of the lengths of the sexual organs of male inhabitants of various regions which he includes in his travel books. He also describes sexual techniques common in the regions he visited, often hinting that he had participated, hence breaking both sexual and racial [[taboo]]s of his day. Many people at the time considered the Kama Shastra Society and the books it published scandalous.

Biographers disagree on whether or not Burton ever experienced [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sex (he never directly acknowledges it in his writing). Allegations began in his army days when General Sir [[Charles James Napier]] requested that Burton go undercover to investigate a male [[brothel]] reputed to be frequented by British soldiers. It has been suggested that Burton's detailed report on the workings of the brothel may have led some to believe he had been a customer.<ref>Burton, Sir Richard ''Kama Sutra'', p. 14, Park Street Press, 1991 ISBN 0-89281-441-1</ref>

Burton was accused by some of murdering the boy who caught him urinating in European fashion on the trip to [[Mecca]]. Burton  denied this, pointing out that killing the boy would almost certainly have led to his being discovered as an imposter. Burton became so tired of denying this accusation that he took to baiting his accusers. A doctor once asked him, "How do you feel when you have killed a man?" Burton retorted, "Quite jolly, what about you?" When asked by a [[priest]] about the same incident Burton is said to have replied "Sir, I'm proud to say I have committed every sin in the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]."<ref>''The Devil Drives: A Life of Sir Richard Burton'' by Fawn M. Brodie (W.W. Norton & Company Inc.: New York 1967) p 3.</ref>

These allegations coupled with Burton's often-irascible nature were said to have harmed his career and may explain why he was not promoted further, either in army life or in the diplomatic service.  As an obituary described: "...he was ill fitted to run in official harness, 
and he had a [[Byron]]ic love of shocking people, of telling tales against himself that had no foundation in fact."<ref>[http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Athenaeum/at3287.htm Obituary in Athenaeum] No. 3287, 25 October 1890 page 547.</ref>  [[Ouida]] reported that "Men at the FO [Foreign Office]... used to hint dark horrors about Burton, and certainly justly or unjustly he was disliked, feared and suspected... not for what he had done, but for what he was believed capable of doing..."<ref>''Richard Burton'' by [[Ouida]], article appearing in the Fortnightly Review June (1906) quoted in ''A Rage to Live'' </ref> Whatever the truth of the many allegations made against him, Burton's interests and outspoken nature ensured that he was always a controversial character in his lifetime.
