'''Kyle Wellwood''' (born May 16, 1983) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[centre (ice hockey)|centre]] who plays for the [[Winnipeg Jets]] of the [[NHL]]. He was originally selected by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] 134th overall in the [[2001 NHL Entry Draft]] and played his first three seasons in the NHL with Toronto, before joining the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 2008. After not re-signing with the Canucks Wellwood played in Russia for [[Atlant Moscow Oblast]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). He left the team due to family concerns and was signed by the [[St. Louis Blues]]. He never played a game with them as he was claimed on [[Waivers (NHL)|waivers]] by the [[San Jose Sharks]]. After one season with the Shraks he signed with the Jets as a free agent. 
==Playing career==
===Junior===
Wellwood was drafted by the [[Belleville Bulls]] in the first round, 16th overall, in the 1999 [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) draft. In his second season with Belleville ([[2000<U+2013>01 OHL season|2000<U+2013>01]]), he put up 118 points, capturing the [[Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy]] as the league's leading scorer.  The next season, he was traded in January 2002 to the [[Windsor Spitfires]] for [[Jason Spezza]]. As a Spitfire, he tallied 100 points in 57 games, including a 29-game stretch in which he scored 26 goals and 59 points.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks claim Wellwood off waivers|url=http://canucks.nhl.com/team/app/?service=page&page=NHLPage&id=18196|publisher=[[Vancouver Canucks]]|accessdate=2008-06-25|date=2008-06-25}}</ref>  In his final year of junior, he also received the [[William Hanley Trophy]] as the OHL's sportsman of the year, as well as the [[CHL Sportsman of the Year]] Award by playing in 57 games without a single penalty minute that year.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Wellwood was drafted in the 5th round, 134th overall, by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the [[2001 NHL Entry Draft]]. He turned pro in [[2003<U+2013>04 AHL season|2003<U+2013>04]] when he joined Toronto's minor league affiliate, the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL).  Wellwood recorded 55 points in his professional rookie season while also appearing in his first NHL game with the Maple Leafs that year.  The [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|NHL lockout]] the following season guaranteed that Wellwood would play in the AHL one more season.  On October 30, 2004, he set a St. John's franchise record by scoring 5 goals in one game against the [[Cleveland Barons (2001-2006)|Cleveland Barons]].{{fact|date=March 2009}}  He finished his second season with St. John's in [[2004<U+2013>05 AHL season|2004<U+2013>05]] fourth in league scoring with 87 points.

As NHL play resumed the following season in [[2005<U+2013>06 NHL season|2005<U+2013>06]], Wellwood joined Toronto's lineup. When captain [[Mats Sundin]] was injured in the first game of the season, Wellwood was bumped to centre the first line between [[Alexei Ponikarovsky]] and [[Nik Antropov]] in Sundin's absence for a month.  He posted a career-high 45 points in his rookie campaign.  The following season, on December 16, 2006, Wellwood scored his first NHL [[hat trick]] in a game against the [[New York Rangers]]. He also had two assists that same night for a career-high five point NHL game.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/12/16/rangers-leafs-nhl-game.html | title = Wellwood, Leafs hammer Rangers | publisher = CBC Sports | date = 2006-12-16 | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref>  On pace to surpass his rookie totals, Wellwood was sidelined for almost half the season and finished with 42 points in 48 games.

Wellwood suffered a [[sports hernia]] before the start of the [[2007&ndash;08 NHL season|2007&ndash;08 season]], and consequently he missed the first 15 games. He returned on November 6, 2007, against the [[Ottawa Senators]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/2007-11-06-leafs-senators_N.htm | title = Senators' 5-1 win over Leafs breaks NHL record | publisher = USA Today | date = 2007-11-07 | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref> After the Leafs had been mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, Wellwood went to Philadelphia for minor surgery on the opposite side of his groin from the first operation, prematurely ending his season with 21 points in 59 games.

===Vancouver Canucks===

During the 2008 off-season, Wellwood broke a bone in his right foot while playing [[indoor soccer]].  With his contract set to expire, the Leafs placed him on waivers on June 24.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=241542 | title = Maple Leafs place Wellwood, Raycroft on waivers | publisher = TSN | date = 2008-06-24 | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref> He was claimed the following day by the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and was signed to a one-year, $998,000 contract.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=241636 | title = Canucks Grab Wellwood Off Waivers | publisher = TSN | date = 2008-06-25 | accessdate = 2008-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks sign Wellwood to 1-year deal|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2008/07/01/canucks_wellwood/|accessdate=2008-10-18|date=2008-07-01|publisher=[[Rogers Sportsnet]]}}</ref>  Reporting to training camp, he failed his initial fitness test and, although he passed a later evaluation,<ref>{{citeweb|title=Wellwood wins battle of the bulge|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080929.wspt_wellwood29/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/|accessdate=2008-10-17|date=2008-09-29|publisher=''[[Globe and Mail]]''}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> he was a healthy scratch to begin the season. On October 17, after having played just one game for the Canucks, he was placed on waivers;<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks place Wellwood on waivers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/10/17/canucks-wellwood.html|accessdate=2008-10-18|date=2008-10-17|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Company|CBC]]}}</ref> after clearing, he was assigned to the [[Manitoba Moose]] of the AHL. Because the addition of Wellwood would have put the Moose over the limit for veteran players, Wellwood started looking at playing options in Europe; however, two days after clearing waivers, injuries to the Canucks forced them to call Wellwood up from the minors, and he cleared re-entry waivers 24 hours later. Wellwood took advantage of this opportunity by getting a goal and an assist in a 4-2 loss to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] and stuck with the club.  Later in the season, on February 17, 2009, Wellwood ended a streak of 159 games without a penalty by taking a high-sticking penalty against the [[Calgary Flames]].  It was his first penalty since April 11, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.canada.com/topics/sports/story.html?id=de9a4f70-8142-4ee6-8ca5-59555e6110b4 | title = Kesler scores twice, Demitra adds shootout winner as Canucks edge Flames  | publisher = Canadian Press | date = 2009-02-17 | accessdate = 2009-02-17}}</ref>  Wellwood ended his first regular season in Vancouver with 18 goals and 9 assists.  Having never reached the post-season with the Maple Leafs, Wellwood made his NHL playoff debut with the Canucks in [[2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2009]] and scored his first NHL playoff goal in game four of the first round against the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]], helping Vancouver complete a sweep in a 3<U+2013>2 overtime win.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks sweep Blues with overtime win|url=http://www.canada.com/Canucks+sweep+Blues+with+overtime+victory/1522221/story.html|accessdate=2009-05-11|date=2009-04-22}}</ref>

In the off-season, Wellwood became a restricted free agent.  After taking the Canucks to arbitration on July 28, 2009, he was re-signed to a one-year, $1.2 million contract two days later on July 30 <ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks re-sign Wellwood to 1-year, $1.2 million contract|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=286227|accessdate=2009-07-30|date=2009-07-30|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>; terms in the collective bargaining agreement did not allow the Canucks to walk away from a ruling of less than $1.57 million.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks 'not walking away' from Wellwood: agent|url=http://www2.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=1842201|accessdate=2011-04-06|date=2009-07-29|publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]]}}</ref> Having earned a reputation in his first Canucks season for a lack of fitness, Wellwood reported to training camp for the [[2009<U+2013>10 NHL season|2009<U+2013>10 season]] 15 pounds lighter than in the previous year.<ref name=weight>{{Citeweb|title=Loads of potential in Canucks' third line|url=http://www.faceoff.com/hockey/teams/vancouver-canucks/story.html?id=2056292&add_feed_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.faceoff.com%2Fscripts%2FSP6Atom.aspx%3Fid%3D894638|accessdate=2009-10-05|date=2009-10-01|publisher=''[[The Province]]''}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  He started the season on the third line with [[Steve Bernier]] and [[Mason Raymond]], a combination that coach [[Alain Vigneault]] carried over from the latter stages of the 2008<U+2013>09 season and playoffs.<ref name=weight/>  Wellwood was sidelined early in the season, suffering a broken toe after blocking a shot from Maple Leafs defenceman [[Mike Komisarek]] in a game on October 24, 2009,<ref>{{citeweb|title=Wellwood suffers broken toe|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=296093|accessdate=2009-10-25|date=2009-10-25|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref> but he returned to the lineup just eight days later, on November 1. He finished the campaign with 14 goals and 25 points in 75 games. He followed that up with a seven-point post-season as the Canucks were eliminated by the Blackhawks in the second round.

===KHL and San Jose Sharks===
After two seasons in Vancouver, the Canucks let Wellwood become an [[unrestricted free agent]] on July 1, 2010, opting instead to sign [[Manny Malhotra]] from the [[San Jose Sharks]] as their projected third-line centre.<ref>{{citenews|title=Wellwood nervously waiting for the phone to ring|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Wellwood+nervously+waiting+phone+ring/3414946/story.html|accessdate=2010-08-18|date=2010-08-18|publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]''|author=Brad Ziermer}}</ref> Wellwood's main goal during the off-season was to find an opportunity to play centre on a scoring line.

Later in the 2010<U+2013>11 season, he was reported to have signed with the [[St. Louis Blues]]; however, Blues officials denied the report, stating that they were unsure where the information came from. Team general manager [[Doug Armstrong]] stated that they were interested in Wellwood but they had not signed him.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Blues say no sign of Wellwood|url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/hockey/professional/morning-skate/article_40555a08-1db3-11e0-9c5f-0017a4a78c22.html|publisher=St. Louis Today|last=O'Neill|first=Dan}}</ref> According to a St. Louis-based reporter, the team was waiting for confirmation of Wellwood's release from Atlant before they finalized the signing.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Wellwood to the Blues?|url=http://www.truehockey.com/articles/Wellwood-to-the-Blues-Updated|publisher=True Hockey|last=Strickland|first=Andy}}</ref>  On January 17, Wellwood officially signed a one-year deal with the Blues,<ref>{{citeweb|title=Blues ink Wellwood to a One-Tear Deal|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=349829|publisher=TSN|date=2011-01-17|accessdate=2011-01-17}}</ref> but needed to clear [[Waivers (NHL)|re-entry waivers]] before joining the team.
