Oxford were firm pre-race favourites, having rowed the course twenty seconds quicker than Cambridge in practice.<ref name=drink82>Drinkwater, p. 82</ref>  Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=burn62/>  The race commenced at 1:02 p.m. in conditions described by author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater as "fine and warm" with a "breeze from the north-west".<ref name=drink82/>  Cambridge made the better start, taking a lead of a canvas length, but were in front for less than a minute.  Oxford took the lead and were clear of the Light Blues by the Mile Post and held a three-length lead at [[Hammersmith Bridge]].  Cambridge encountered choppy water and, according to Drinkwater, "fell to pieces".<ref name=drink82/>  Oxford drew away to win by seven lengths in a time of 20 minutes 12 seconds.<ref name=burn62>Burnell, p. 62</ref>  It was Oxford's third consecutive win and the fastest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1873|1873 race]].  The result took the overall record to 21&ndash;17 in their favour.<ref name=results/>
