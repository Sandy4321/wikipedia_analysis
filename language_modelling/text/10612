In [[mathematics]], the '''method of characteristics''' is a technique for solving [[partial differential equations]].  Typically, it applies to [[first order partial differential equation|first-order equations]], although more generally the method of characteristics is valid for any [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]].  The method is to reduce a partial differential equation to a family of ordinary differential equations along which the solution can be integrated from some initial data given on a suitable [[hypersurface]].

==Characteristics of first-order partial differential equations==
For a first-order PDE, the method of characteristics discovers curves (called '''characteristic curves''' or just characteristics) along which the PDE becomes an [[ordinary differential equation]] (ODE).  Once the ODE is found, it can be solved along the characteristic curves and transformed into a solution for the original PDE.

For the sake of motivation, we confine our attention to the case of a function of two independent variables ''x'' and ''y'' for the moment.  Consider a [[Differential equations#Types of differential equations|quasilinear]] PDE of the form

{{NumBlk|:|<math>a(x,y,u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+b(x,y,u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=c(x,y,u).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Suppose that a solution ''u'' is known, and consider the surface graph ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''u''(''x'',''y'') in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  A [[normal vector]] to this surface is given by

:<math>(u_x(x,y),u_y(x,y),-1).\,</math>

As a result,<ref>{{harvnb|John|1991}}</ref> equation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is equivalent to the geometrical statement that the vector field

:<math>(a(x,y,z),b(x,y,z),c(x,y,z))\,</math>

is tangent to the surface ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''u''(''x'',''y'') at every point.  In other words, the graph of the solution must be a union of [[integral curve]]s of this vector field.  These integral curves are called the characteristic curves of the original partial differential equation.

The equations of the characteristic curve may be expressed invariantly by the ''Charpit-Lagrange equations''<ref>{{harvnb|Delgado|1997}}</ref>

:<math>\frac{dx}{a(x,y,z)} = \frac{dy}{b(x,y,z)} = \frac{dz}{c(x,y,z)},</math>

or, if a particular parametrization ''t'' of the curves is fixed, then these equations may be written as a system of ordinary differential equations for ''x''(''t''), ''y''(''t''), ''z''(''t''):

:<math>
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{dx}{dt}&=&a(x,y,z)\\
\frac{dy}{dt}&=&b(x,y,z)\\
\frac{dz}{dt}&=&c(x,y,z).
\end{array}
</math>

These are the '''characteristic equations''' for the original system.<!-- [[Characteristic equations]] redirects to this article -->

===Linear and quasilinear cases===
Consider now a PDE of the form

:<math>\sum_{i=1}^n a_i(x_1,\dots,x_n,u) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}=c(x_1,\dots,x_n,u).</math>

For this PDE to be [[linear]], the coefficients ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> may be functions of the spatial variables only, and independent of ''u''.  For it to be [[Differential equations#Types of differential equations|quasilinear]], ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> may also depend on the value of the function, but not on any derivatives.  The distinction between these two cases is inessential for the discussion here.

For a linear or quasilinear PDE, the characteristic curves are given parametrically by

:<math>(x_1,\dots,x_n,u) = (x_1(s),\dots,x_n(s),u(s))</math>

such that the following system of ODEs is satisfied

{{NumBlk|:|<math>\frac{dx_i}{ds} = a_i(x_1,\dots,x_n,u)</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|<math>\frac{du}{ds} = c(x_1,\dots,x_n,u).</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Equations ({{EquationNote|2}}) and ({{EquationNote|3}}) give the characteristics of the PDE.

===Fully nonlinear case===
Consider the partial differential equation

:<math>F(x_1,\dots,x_n,u,p_1,\dots,p_n)=0\qquad\qquad (1)</math>

where the variables ''p''<sub>i</sub> are shorthand for the partial derivatives

:<math>p_i = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}.</math>

Let (''x''<sub>i</sub>(''s''),''u''(''s''),''p''<sub>i</sub>(''s'')) be a curve in '''R'''<sup>2n+1</sup>.  Suppose that ''u'' is any solution, and that

:<math>u(s) = u(x_1(s),\dots,x_n(s)).</math>

Along a solution, differentiating (1) with respect to ''s'' gives

:<math>\sum(F_{x_i} + F_u p_i)\dot{x}_i + \sum F_{p_i}\dot{p}_i = 0</math>

:<math>\dot{u} - \sum p_i \dot{x}_i = 0</math>

:<math>\sum (\dot{x}_i dp_i - \dot{p}_i dx_i)= 0.</math>

(The second equation follows from applying the [[chain rule]] to a solution ''u'', and the third follows by taking an [[exterior derivative]] of the relation ''du''-&Sigma;''p''<sub>i</sub>''dx''<sub>i</sub>=0.)  Manipulating these equations gives

:<math>\dot{x}_i=\lambda F_{p_i},\quad\dot{p}_i=-\lambda(F_{x_i}+F_up_i),\quad \dot{u}=\lambda\sum p_iF_{p_i}</math>

where &lambda; is a constant.  Writing these equations more symmetrically, one obtains the [[Charpit-Lagrange equations]] for the characteristic

:<math>\frac{\dot{x}_i}{F_{p_i}}=-\frac{\dot{p}_i}{F_{x_i}+F_up_i}=\frac{\dot{u}}{\sum p_iF_{p_i}}.</math>

== Example ==

As an example, consider the [[advection equation]] (this example assumes familiarity with PDE notation, and solutions to basic ODEs).

:<math>a \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0\,</math>

where <math>a\,</math> is constant and <math>u\,</math> is a function of <math>x\,</math> and <math>t\,</math>. We want to transform this linear first order PDE into an ODE along the appropriate curve; i.e. something of the form

:<math> \frac{d}{ds}u(x(s), t(s)) = F(u, x(s), t(s)) </math>,

where <math>(x(s),t(s))\,</math> is a characteristic line. First, we find

:<math>\frac{d}{ds}u(x(s), t(s)) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{ds} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \frac{dt}{ds}</math>

by the chain rule.  Now, if we set <math> \frac{dx}{ds} = a</math> and <math>\frac{dt}{ds} = 1</math> we get

:<math> a \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  \,</math>

which is the left hand side of the PDE we started with. Thus

:<math>\frac{d}{ds}u = a \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  = 0.</math>

So, along the characteristic line <math>(x(s), t(s))\,</math>, the original PDE becomes the ODE <math>u_s = F(u, x(s), t(s)) = 0\,</math>. Already we can make a very important observation: along the characteristics the solution is constant.  Thus, <math>u(x_s, t_s) = u(x_0, 0)\,</math> where <math>(x_s, t_s)\,</math> and <math>(x_0, 0)\,</math> lie on the same characteristic.  But we are not done yet--the exact solution awaits!  Now we have three ODEs to solve.

* <math>\frac{dt}{ds} = 1</math>, letting <math>t(0)=0\,</math> we know <math>t=s\,</math>,
* <math>\frac{dx}{ds} = a</math>, letting <math>x(0)=x_0\,</math> we know <math>x=as+x_0=at+x_0\,</math>,
* <math>\frac{du}{ds} = 0</math>, letting <math>u(0)=f(x_0)\,</math> we know <math>u(x(t), t)=f(x_0)=f(x-at)\,</math>.

So, we can conclude that the characteristic lines are straight lines with slope <math>a\,</math>, and the value of <math>u\,</math> remains constant along any characteristic line.

<!-- A solution is shown in the figure below as a surface plot and a contour plot.  Notice, as we predicted, the solution is constant along the lines of slope <math>a\,</math>.  This forces the wave along <math>x\,</math> as <math>t\,</math> advances. -->

== Qualitative Analysis of Characteristics ==
Characteristics are also a powerful tool for gaining qualitative insight into a PDE.

One can use the crossings of the characteristics to find [[shock wave|shockwaves]]. Intuitively, we can think of each characteristic line implying a solution to <math>u\,</math> along itself. Thus, when two characteristics cross two solutions are implied. This causes shockwaves and the solution to <math>u\,</math> becomes a [[multivalued function]]. Solving PDEs with this behavior is a very difficult problem and an active area of research.

Characteristics may fail to cover part of the domain of the PDE.  This is called a [[rarefaction]], and indicates the solution typically exists only in a weak, i.e. [[integral equation]], sense.  

The direction of the characteristic lines indicate the flow of values through the solution, as the example above demonstrates.  This kind of knowledge is useful when solving PDEs numerically as it can indicate which [[finite difference]] scheme is best for the problem.

== Applications ==

It is the classic way of modelling pressure waves in fluid filled pipelines<ref name=SW>{{harvnb|Streeter|Wylie|1998}}</ref>. This is important in predicting [[water hammer]] and other forms of pressure surges.

Another classical application is the [[dam break wave]], first solved in 1892 for an ideal fluid flow (the Ritter solution) and later extended to real fluid flows with boundary friction <ref name=HC>{{harvnb|Chanson|2009}}</ref>. Dam break waves have been responsible for numerous losses of life: the catastrophes of the South Fork dam ([[Johnstown dam]]) (USA, 1889), [[St Francis dam]] (USA 1928) and of the [[Malpasset dam]] (France 1959). Another situation is the bombing of the Ruhr dams by the [[Dam Busters]] during Word War II on 16/17th May 1943. Related situations include flash flood runoff in ephemeral streams, debris flow surges and tsunami runup on dry coastal plains. In all cases, the surge front is a sudden discontinuity characterised by extremely rapid variations of flow depth and velocity. For a one-dimensional application, the continuity and momentum equations yield the [[Saint-Venant equations]] that may be solved using the method of characteristics.
