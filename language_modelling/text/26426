'''Jason Christopher Dufner''' (born March 24, 1977) is an American [[professional golfer]] who currently plays on the [[PGA Tour]] where he is a three-time winner. He has won one [[Major golf championship|major championship]], the [[2013 PGA Championship]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=PGA |url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/news/jason-dufner-wins-pga-championship-first-major |title=Jason Dufner wins 2013 PGA Championship |first=Doug |last=Ferguson |date=August 11, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> He was also runner-up in the [[2011 PGA Championship]], losing a playoff to [[Keegan Bradley]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=PGA |url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2011/news/dufner-081411.cfm |title=Dufner loses playoff at 2011 PGA Championship |first=Stan |last=Awtrey |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> Dufner has been ranked inside the top ten for 35 weeks, with his career high being number six achieved in September 2012.

==Early life==
Dufner was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. He moved to the [[Washington, D.C.]] area when he was 11 years old, and then to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]],<ref name="birth">{{cite web |publisher=Cleveland.com |url=http://www.cleveland.com/golf/index.ssf/2011/08/jason_dufner_remains_a_big_browns_indians_fan_from_childhood_in_northeast_ohio_relatives_say.html |title=PGA Championship runner-up Jason Dufner remains a big Browns, Indians fan from childhood in Northeast Ohio, relatives say |first=Tim |last=Rogers |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref> when he was 14. It was there that he started playing golf, and played for [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]] during his sophomore, junior and senior years.<ref name="highschool">{{cite web |publisher=Golf Ohio |url=http://www.golfohio.com/departments/features/jason-dufner-profile.htm |title=Jason Dufner ready for excitement |first=Jason |last=Stahl |date=July 29, 2003 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref>

==Amateur career==
Dufner was a [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] at [[Auburn University]], where he won three times in his college career and was an Honorable Mention All-American in 1997.<ref name="highschool"/> He graduated from Auburn in 2000 with a degree in economics.<ref name="collegedegree">{{cite web |publisher=Auburn University |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/spec-rel/081411aab.html |title=Dufner Earns Highest Ever Finish For Auburn Golfer At A Major |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref>

In 1998, Dufner played in the finals of the [[U.S. Amateur Public Links]] at [[Torrey Pines Golf Course|Torrey Pines]], falling to [[Trevor Immelman]], 3 and 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usga.org/ChampEventContent.aspx?id=21474852603 |title=U.S. Amateur Public Links Champions |publisher=USGA |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

==Professional career==
In his early career, Dufner struggled to hold down a place on the PGA Tour. He was a member of the PGA Tour in [[2004 PGA Tour|2004]] and the [[Nationwide Tour]] in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006. Dufner won two events during his time on the Nationwide Tour, the [[BUY.COM Wichita Open]] in 2001 and the [[LaSalle Bank Open]] in 2006. He finished in 8th place on the Nationwide Tour money list in 2006 to earn his PGA Tour card for [[2007 PGA Tour|2007]]. He finished 127th in the [[FedEx Cup]] standings in 2007, and failed to qualify at the PGA Tour Q-School, where he finished T149. He retained conditional status for the [[2008 PGA Tour|2008]] PGA Tour season, and then finished T11 at the Q-School that year to earn his card for 2009. He has been a member of the PGA Tour every year since. In [[PGA Tour|2009]], Dufner finished in the top-10 on six occasions, including a third place finish at the [[RBC Canadian Open]], and a runner up place at the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]], part of the FedEx Cup playoffs. As a result, Dufner went on to finish the year 11th in the FedEx Cup standings and 33rd on the year's money list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-tours-news/pga-tour/2009-11/2009pgamoney |title=Final 2009 PGA Tour Money List |work=Golf Digest |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Dufner had a less successful [[2010 PGA Tour|2010]] season, recording only two top-10 finishes. However, his best finish of the year came in a major championship, at the [[2010 PGA Championship]] at [[Whistling Straits]]. He finished in a tie for fifth place, two strokes short of the playoff. This was the best result to date Dufner had recorded in a major. He was eliminated in the third [[FedEx Cup]] playoff event and did not qualify for the [[The Tour Championship]].<ref name=results>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/players/player.25686.jason-dufner.html/season/#uber |title=PGA Tour results |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

===2011===
Early in [[2011 PGA Tour|2011]], Dufner had a chance to win his first PGA Tour title at the [[Waste Management Phoenix Open]] at [[TPC Scottsdale]] when he finished tied for the lead at 18-under-par after 72 holes, before eventually losing in a playoff to [[Mark Wilson (golfer)|Mark Wilson]]. Wilson made a birdie on the second extra hole and the best Dufner could manage there was a par. He also had a good finish in the [[Zurich Classic of New Orleans]] where a final-round 66 boosted him to a tie for third place. Dufner earned entry into the [[2011 U.S. Open (golf)|2011 U.S. Open]] after [[Anders Hansen]] withdrew; previously during a qualifying tournament in Georgia, Dufner had lost in a playoff to [[Russell Henley]]. He also played in the [[2011 Open Championship]] as a result of [[Tiger Woods]] pulling out due to injury.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/jul/05/tiger-woods-the-open |title=Tiger Woods aims for US PGA return after knee rules him out of the Open |date=July 5, 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Lawrence |last=Donegan |accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> He missed the cut in both the U.S. Open and the Open Championship.<ref name=results/>

====2011 PGA Championship near miss====
At the [[2011 PGA Championship]] in Atlanta, Dufner was in contention to win his first major and maiden PGA Tour title, when he entered the final round in the last group and tied for the lead with [[Brendan Steele]] at seven under par. Dufner completed the front nine in 33, two under par, while playing partner Steele dropped four shots early on and fell out of contention. Dufner held the lead for most of the final round and was bogey-free through 14 holes. After his nearest challenger, [[Keegan Bradley]], made triple bogey on the 15th, Dufner had a five-stroke advantage with four holes to play. Dufner then hit his tee shot on 15 into the water hazard right of the green on the par three. He got up and down from the drop zone to make bogey, but followed this with bogeys at 16 and 17. Meanwhile, Bradley scored back-to-back birdies on 16 and 17 to take the clubhouse lead at eight under, wiping out Dufner's advantage. Dufner parred the 18th and the two American players went into a three-hole aggregate playoff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/golf/pga/players/Jason+Dufner/4269/scorecard/2011/33 |title=Jason Dufner <U+2013> Scorecard <U+2013> 2011 PGA Championship |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |date=August 16, 2011 |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

On the first playoff hole, both players hit their approach shots to 16 within a few feet. Bradley made his birdie putt, while Dufner missed his birdie, allowing Bradley to take a one-stroke advantage to the 17th. Both players found the green from the tee, and while Bradley two-putted for his par, Dufner knocked his first putt well past the hole, and three-putted the green to fall two strokes behind with one to play. At the last hole, Bradley's second shot cleared the water by a few yards; Dufner then followed with a shot on the same line and made his birdie putt. Bradley only needed to two-putt for the championship, which he did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/14524821.stm |title=Keegan Bradley defeats Jason Dufner in US PGA play off|date=August 14, 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Rob |last=Hodgetts |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> This was Dufner's best major finish, winning $865,000 of the purse, with both of his career high finishes in majors coming at the PGA Championship. With his second place finish, he rose to 38th in the [[Official World Golf Ranking]] (OWGR).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/archive/2011/owgr33f2011.pdf |title=Official World Golf Ranking <U+2013> Week 33, 2011 |publisher=OWGR |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

===2012===
Dufner continued his good form in [[2012 PGA Tour|2012]] by sharing the 36-hole lead at the [[2012 Masters Tournament|Masters]], but faded on the weekend to finish T24.<ref>{{cite news |last=DeShazier |first=John |url=http://www.nola.com/golf/index.ssf/2012/04/zurich_classic_of_new_orleans_36.html |title=Zurich Classic of New Orleans: Jason Dufner has a good shot to pick up his first win |date=April 28, 2012 |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Three weeks later at the [[Zurich Classic of New Orleans]], Dufner won for the first time on the [[PGA Tour]] in his 164th start when he defeated [[Ernie Els]] on the second hole of a sudden death playoff. He entered the final round with a two stroke advantage and shot a 70 to finish at 19 under par, a tournament total record, which Els also equalled. At the first playoff hole, the 18th, Els had a chance to clinch victory with a six foot putt, but pushed it out to the right. Replaying the 18th again, Dufner found the green in two and when Els couldn't get up and down from 100 yards short of the green, Dufner sealed the win with a two putt. Dufner moved into the world's top 20 as a result of his first victory.<ref>{{cite news |last=Iles |first=Trey |url=http://www.nola.com/golf/index.ssf/2012/04/jason_dufner_wins_zurich_class.html |title=Jason Dufner wins Zurich Classic in second hole of sudden death over Ernie Els |date=April 29, 2012 |work=The Times-Picayune |accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> 

Three weeks later, Dufner chalked up his second victory with a win at the [[HP Byron Nelson Championship]] by one stroke over [[Dicky Pride]], who was seeking his first win since 1994. Dufner began the final round with the 54-hole lead, but suffered setbacks when he bogeyed two and three to surrender the lead. He recovered with birdies at four, five and seven, but remained behind playing partner [[JJ Henry]] until the 17th when Henry made double bogey. Now tied for the lead with Pride, the clubhouse leader, after 71 holes, Dufner sank a 25 foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole for the outright victory. The win elevated Dufner to 14th in the OWGR and first in the [[FedEx Cup]] standings. Dufner became only the second multiple winner on the [[PGA Tour]] in 2012, alongside [[Hunter Mahan]]. 

In May 2012, Dufner had an opportunity to win his third PGA Tour title of the year at the [[Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial|Colonial]], where he was leading after 36 and 54 holes respectively before being beaten by one stroke by former Masters champion [[Zach Johnson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/pga/story/2012-05-27/zach-johnson-wins-crowne-plaza-invitational-at-colonial/55237622/1 |title=Zach Johnson passes Jason Dufner to win at Colonial |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=May 27, 2012 |accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref> The second place finish, however, catapulted Dufner to 8th place in the Official World Golf Ranking, a career best ranking.

Dufner's excellent season continued at the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]] where he finished in a tie for fourth place, two strokes behind winner [[Webb Simpson]]. This is his best finish to date in the U.S. Open.<ref name=results/>

Dufner qualified for his first [[Ryder Cup]] team in 2012, finishing with a record of 3<U+2013>1 in the three day matches, including a 2-up win over [[Peter Hanson]] in the singles competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rydercup.com/usa/scoring/scorecards/25686 |title=Leaderboard and Scoring |publisher=Ryder Cup |date=September 30, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

===2013===
In January 2013, Dufner stated an interest in taking up a membership with the European Tour.<ref name=Golf>{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Will |title=Dufner considering membership on European Tour |url=http://www.golfchannel.com/news/golftalkcentral/dufner-considering-membership-on-european-tour/ |publisher=Golf Channel |date=January 16, 2013 |accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref>

In June 2013, Dufner finished fourth at the [[2013 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] at [[Merion Golf Club]], the second year in a row finishing fourth at the tournament. Dufner entered the final round at +8, but birdied five of the first 14 holes to pull to +3 overall. However, he triple-bogeyed the par-4 15th hole to move back to +6. After a birdie at 16, Dufner scored par on holes 17 and 18 to finish the tournament at +5, four shots behind the leader, [[Justin Rose]].<ref name=results/>

====2013 PGA Championship victory====
At the [[2013 PGA Championship|PGA Championship]] in August, Dufner won his maiden [[major championship]] with a two stroke victory at [[Oak Hill Country Club]] in [[Rochester, New York]]. After beginning the tournament with a two under round of 68, Dufner tied the record for all-time lowest round in a major and broke the course record at [[Oak Hill Country Club]] by shooting a seven-under-par 63 in the second round. He carded five birdies and an eagle, the latter achieved when he holed out from 105 yards on the par-4 2nd hole. Dufner had the chance to finish with a 62 and the outright lowest round in a major, but he left his 12-foot putt for birdie at the 18th hole short.<ref>{{cite web |last=Auclair |first=T.

In round three, Dufner shot a one over round of 71 to fall out of the lead, one stroke behind [[Jim Furyk]]. This marked the second time in three years that Dufner would be in the final group of the PGA Championship on Sunday. He went on to shoot a final round 68, finishing 10 under par for the tournament and beating runner-up [[Jim Furyk]] by two strokes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-2389556/Jason-Dufner-wins-PGA-Championship-Oak-Hill.html |title=Dufner wins first major of his career with a brilliant final round at Oak Hill |first=Derek |last=Lawrenson |date=August 12, 2013 |newspaper=Daily Mail |accessdate=August 12, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/23662410 |title=Jason Dufner wins maiden major title at Oak Hill |date=August 12, 2013 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Rob |last=Hodgetts |accessdate=August 12, 2013 }}</ref>
