'''Colbert Michael "Cole" Hamels''' (born December 27, 1983) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. Originally from [[San Diego, California]], Hamels excelled in high school both academically and athletically. The Philadelphia Phillies drafted him out of high school in the first round of the {{by|2002}} draft (17th overall), and he began his career in the Phillies minor league system. Numerous issues, including an injury sustained in a bar fight as well as other injuries, occurred during his first few minor league seasons. Having reached the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] level, he was the top pitcher in the Phillies' minor league system in {{by|2006}}.

In May 2006, Hamels made his major league debut for the Phillies. After securing a long-term spot as a member of the Phillies [[starting rotation]] in his [[rookie]] season, he made large strides in the [[2007 Major League Baseball season]] and won the Phillies' top major league pitcher award. He was the top pitcher on the team entering the {{by|2008}} season, and during the Phillies' postseason run, during which they ultimately won the [[2008 World Series]], he won the [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award]]. Since then, he has been a top starter in the Phillies' rotation. After the 2008 season, Hamels signed a three-year contract with the Phillies. His statistics declined over the next two seasons, struggling through a tumultuous {{by|2009}} campaign and somewhat bouncing back in {{by|2010}}, however still not approaching his 2008 numbers. Over the next few seasons, Hamels was joined by fellow all-star pitchers including [[Roy Halladay]], [[Cliff Lee]], and [[Roy Oswalt]], and flourished with them, putting up some of his top career seasons before suffering from poor run support in {{by|2013}}.

==Early life==
Cole Hamels attended Meadowbrook Middle School and [[Rancho Bernardo High School]] in [[San Diego, California]]. He was a "gifted student", and obtained high [[SAT]] scores.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phillies sign Cole Hamels to $144M deal|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/sports/pro/baseball&id=8748374|work=6abc.com|publisher=WPVI/DT ABC|accessdate=November 29, 2013|date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> Scouts were interested in Hamels while he was in high school primarily because his fastball was clocked as high as {{convert|94|mph}}, and his secondary offerings were considered advanced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Winkelman|first=Matt|title=Cole Hamels: A Draft Retrospective|url=http://www.thegoodphight.com/2013/6/5/4399142/cole-hamels-a-draft-retrospective|work=The Good Phight <U+2013> SB Nation|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=November 29, 2013|date=June 5, 2013}}</ref> However, some teams lost interest when Hamels broke his left [[humerus]] during his sophomore year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/news/postseason/traces.jsp?loc=traces_hamels | title=Broken arm didn't derail Phillies youngster | publisher=[[MLB.com]] | accessdate=25 February 2014 | author=Scarr, Mike}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sickels|first=John|title=Phillies pitching prospect Cole Hamels|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=1615806|work=ESPN <U+2013> MLB|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=February 26, 2014|date=September 14, 2003}}</ref>  Nonetheless, Hamels was drafted in the first round of the [[2002 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the Philadelphia Phillies, who held the 17th overall selection.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sickels|first=John|title=Phillies pitching prospect Cole Hamels|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=1615806|work=MLB <U+2013> ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=November 29, 2013|date=September 14, 2003}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Minor league career===
Hamels began his professional baseball career in 2003, pitching for the [[Single-A|Class A]] [[Lakewood BlueClaws]] of the [[South Atlantic League]]. Later that season, he was promoted to the [[Clearwater Threshers]] of the [[Class A-Advanced]] [[Florida State League]]. He finished the year by receiving the [[Paul Owens Award]], given to the best pitcher in the [[List of Philadelphia Phillies minor league affiliates|Phillies' minor league system]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20030902&content_id=508225&vkey=pr_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi |title=Phillies announce 2003 Paul Owens Award winners |accessdate=October 15, 2009|date=September 2, 2003|publisher=phillies.com: News}}</ref>

During the next two seasons, however, Hamels suffered through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly. He missed most of the 2004 season with elbow tendinitis, making only four starts. In 2005, he broke his pitching hand in a bar fight before the season began;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050201&content_id=937908&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi |title=Hamels to have surgery on left hand |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |last=Gennaria |first=Mike |date=February 1, 2005 |work=phillies.com: News |publisher=MLB Advanced Media }}</ref> after [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], he was assigned to Clearwater. In July, the Phillies promoted him to the [[Class AA]] [[Reading Phillies]] of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]], where he surrendered the first home run of his professional career in his first start. Subsequently, he was shut down for the remainder of the season with [[back spasms]].<ref name="media-guide"/>{{rp|84}} 

In 2006, a healthy Hamels started again at Clearwater, and after a brief stint in Reading, he was promoted to the [[Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons]] of the [[Class AAA]] [[International League]]. In three games at Scranton, he [[Strikeout|struck out]] 36 batters while giving up only one [[Base on balls|walk]] and one [[Run (baseball)|run]].<ref name="callup">{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060510&content_id=1446829&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi |title=Phenom Hamels to be called up to Phils |accessdate=April 27, 2007 |last=Mandel |first=Ken |date=May 10, 2006 |work=phillies.com: News |publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}</ref> His minor league statistics included a [[win-loss record|record]] of 14<U+2013>4 with a 1.43 ERA and 273 strikeouts in 35 games pitched.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cole Hamels Minor League Statistics & History|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=hamels001col|work=Minors @ Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref> For his performance, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club.<ref name="media-guide"/>{{rp|84}}

====2008====
{{see also|2008 Philadelphia Phillies season}}
Before the season began in March, Hamels made a complaint about the Phillies underpaying him, saying it was a "low blow" and he was "caught off-guard" with the gap between what he and his [[Sports agent|agent]] John Boggs felt was a fair reward for his performance in the previous season and what he was paid (the Phillies paid him {{USD|500,000}}, barely above the minimum salary for MLB players despite Hamels' strong performance).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080311105515/proathletesonly.com/news/featured/baseballs-young-stars-caught-in-salary-trap/|title=Baseball's Young Stars Caught in Salary Trap|last=Smallwood|first=John|date=March 4, 2008|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=August 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Zolecki|first=Todd|title=Hamels is hot under the contract The Phillies renewed the lefthander's pact at $500,000.

Though Hamels was the "clear-cut ace", Charlie Manuel penciled in [[Brett Myers]] as the Phillies' opening day starter because Myers accepted his role as closer the preceding season, putting the team ahead of his personal wishes to start.
[[File:Cole Hamels 2008 World Champions.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cole Hamels in World Series victory parade on October 31, 2008]]
By the end of April, Hamels led the Phillies in most pitching categories, including wins (3), ERA (2.70), and innings pitched (43<U+2153>). Continuing his dominance into May, Hamels recorded his first career complete game [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Atlanta Braves]] on the 15th of that month.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280515122 | title=Hamels, Howard help Phillies blank Braves | publisher=[[ESPN]] | date=15 May 2008 | accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI200805150.shtml | title=May 15, 2008 Atlanta Braves at Philadelphia Phillies Play by Play and Box Score | publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] | accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> By June, Myers had been demoted to the minor leagues due to his ineffectiveness, leaving Hamels alone atop the rotation.

Hamels pitched in Game 1 of the [[2008 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the Brewers, pitching "eight spectacular two-hit shutout innings" during which he struck out nine hitters, notching his first career playoff win, and the Phillies first playoff win since 1993.<ref name="stark"/>{{rp|49}} He commented, "I knew the importance of the game.

Hamels was selected the Phillies starter for game one of the [[2008 World Series|World Series]]; the Phillies won 3<U+2013>2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Subsequently, Jayson Stark wrote, {{quote|The names on the list are the names who have carved their legends in the month of October ...

Statistically, Hamels rebounded from his previous season by posting a 12<U+2013>11 record with a 3.06 ERA, the latter of which was, at the time, a career-best. He also struck out a career high 211 batters. Throughout the season, he was plagued by a lack of [[run support]]; in {{frac|1|3}} of his starts, the Phillies did not score a single run while he was in the game.

In 2012, [[Fangraphs]] ranked Hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only [[Jason Vargas]], [[Tommy Milone]], and [[F<U+00E9>lix Hern<U+00E1>ndez]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Major League Leaderboard<U+2014>top change ups|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=7&season=2012&month=0&season1=2012&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=6,d|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Hardball Times]]'' called his changeup a "killer" pitch to right-handed hitters, noting that while it is also effective against left-handed hitters, when they put it in play, they generally have success.<ref name="ht">{{cite web|last=Fast|first=Mike|title=Scouting report on Cole Hamels|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/scouting-report-on-cole-hamels/|work=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014|date=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Rangers pitching coach [[Mike Maddux]] said of Hamels, {{quote|"It's a difficult task to try to get young guys to throw changeups, because their whole amateur career is spent staring at the scout with the gun.

He could no longer work on his [[curveball]] for several months, and was forced to focus on the changeup.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamels: The beast beneath the flash|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-06-18/sports/32300055_1_cole-hamels-mark-furtak-phillies-pitcher|accessdate=December 8, 2013|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name="si"/> [[Chipper Jones]], who was a star-[[third baseman]] for the rival [[Atlanta Braves]] commented that Hamels is the "best lefthander in the National League ... you have to respect his fastball, and his change-up is devastating.

==Personal life==
===Family===
The oldest of three children, Hamels lives in [[Newtown Square, Pennsylvania]] (though he grew up in San Diego, where his parents still live), with his wife, Heidi Strobel, whom he married on December 31, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/heidi-hamels-just-mrs-cole-hamels/3/ | title=Heidi Hamels Is More Than Just Mrs. Cole Hamels | publisher=[[Philadelphia_(magazine)|Philadelphia]] | date=22 November 2013 | accessdate=26 February 2014 | author=Rays, Richard}}</ref> Strobel was a contestant on the sixth season of the [[reality show]] ''[[Survivor: The Amazon]]''.

===The Hamels Foundation===
Hamels created and currently runs an organization known as ''The Hamels Foundation'' with his wife, Heidi Strobel. The foundation was created in 2008, and "is dedicated to enriching the lives of children through the power of education by giving them the tools they need to achieve their goals".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://phl17.com/2013/09/20/phillies-pitcher-cole-hamels-recieves-jamie-moyer-legends-award/#axzz2n1mc9oVd | title=Phillies<U+2019> Pitcher Cole Hamels Receives <U+2018>Jamie Moyer Legends Award<U+2019> | accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref> The Hamels Foundation funds childhood programs in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Africa]]. The Hamels family pays for the administrative expenses, allowing for all donated money to go towards charity. Hamels created the foundation because he wasn't thrilled that some of his donations to other charities didn't entirely go to the cause (some of the money went to administrative expenses).<ref name="Forbes: Hamels Foundation">{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2013/09/05/cole-hamels-runs-an-athlete-charity-that-actually-works/ | title=Cole Hamels Runs An Athlete Charity That Actually Works | publisher=Forbes | date=September 5, 2013 | accessdate=December 9, 2013 | author=Burke, Monte}}</ref>

The Hamels Foundation has focused their attention and funds on the poor African country of Malawi, building both elementary and secondary schools there. Because Malawi suffers from the one of the highest HIV-fatality rates in Africa, they felt education among school children was an essential first step in decreasing the occurrence of HIV. <ref>{{cite web|last=Whitmore|first=Kendra|title=Heidi Hamels on the Plight of Malawi<U+2019>s Orphans|url=http://westernjournal.com/heidi-hamels-plight-malawis-orphans/|publisher=Western Journal|accessdate=December 26, 2013|date=December 26, 2013}}</ref>
