'''JScript.Encode''' is a method created by [[Microsoft]] used to [[encode]] both server and client-side [[JavaScript]] or [[VB Script]] [[source code]] in order to protect the [[source code]] from [[copying]]<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0899/scriptengine/scriptengine.asp Script Encoding with the Microsoft Script Engine Version 5.0]</ref>. JavaScript code is used for creating [[dynamic web content]] on many websites, with the source code easily viewable, so this was meant to protect the code. 

The encoding is a simple [[polyalphabetic substitution]] using three alphabets.

==How To Use==
You can use a [[command line]] script encoder [http://www.microsoft.com/mind/0899/scriptengine/scriptengine.asp] to encode your scripts. To encode a [[HTML]] web-page file called <tt>default.htm</tt>, use the following command:

<pre>
screnc.exe default.htm defaultenc.htm
</pre>

It would output to a file called <tt>defaultenc.htm</tt>.
