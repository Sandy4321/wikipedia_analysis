'''Jason McElwain''' (born October 1, 1987) is a man with [[Autism|autism]], nicknamed '''"J-Mac"''', who made national news when, after being the manager for [[Greece Athena High School]]'s basketball team, he played four minutes during a game and scored twenty points.

McElwain was diagnosed with autism at a young age, and he did not talk until he was five years old. As a child, he had trouble interacting with other kids, but during his teenage years he began to develop social skills and make friends. McElwain had a passion for basketball, so Greece Athena High School basketball coach Jim Johnson appointed him manager of the team.

On February 16, 2006, Greece Athena was playing [[Spencerport High School]] for a division title. Greece Athena got a large lead, so Johnson decided to let McElwain play in the last four minutes. After initially missing two shots, McElwain made six [[three-point shot]]s and one two-pointer. After the final buzzer rang, the crowd dashed onto the court in celebration of McElwain's amazing game.
