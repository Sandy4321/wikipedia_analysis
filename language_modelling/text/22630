Dried ''Bunium bulbocastanum'' [[fruit]]s are used as a culinary [[spice]] in northern [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[Iran]].  It is practically unknown outside these areas. The tuber-like root is locally collected for food; the "pignut" or chestnut" names refer to it.{{cn}}

==Etymology==
Local names for that spice are ''kala zeera'' (black cumin) or ''shahi zeera'' (imperial cumin) in [[Hindi language|Hindi]], as  <U+0633><U+06CC><U+0627><U+06C1> <U+0632><U+06CC><U+0631><U+06C1>  ("syah zirah", "black cumin"), <U+06A9><U+0627><U+0644><U+0627> <U+0632><U+06CC><U+0631><U+06C1> ("kaala zirah", "black cumin") and <U+0632><U+064A><U+0631><U+0647> <U+0643><U+0648><U+0647><U+06CC> ("zirah kuhi", "mountain/wild cumin") in [[Urdu]], <U+0632><U+064A><U+0631><U+0647> <U+0643><U+0648><U+0647><U+06CC> (''zireh kuhi'', "wild cumin") in [[Persian language|Persian]] and as <U+0441><U+0438><U+0451><U+0445> <U+0434><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430> (''siyoh dona'', "black seed") in [[Tajik language|Tajiki]].

The commonly used Hindi term ''shahi zeera'' may be a distortion of ''syahi'' (black in Persian) ''zeera''. However, in the [[Hindustani Language]], the term ''syahi'' also means "inky black". In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], ''kalo zeera'' also means black cumin, but refers to ''Nigella'', not ''B. bulbocastanum''. ''[[Nigella]]'' is widely used as a spice in [[Bengali people|Bengali]] food, while ''B. bulbocastanum'' is rare.

==Growth==
The plant grows wild in a wide range from southeastern [[Europe]] east to southern [[Asia]]. It reaches about {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall and {{convert|25|cm|in}} wide, bearing frilly leaves and hermaphroditic flowers; it is pollinated by insects and self-fertile.{{cn{{  The plants from which one can pick Kala Zeera are seen in the higher-elevation region of Drass and Kargil sector in the Leh region and in some parts of Spiti also. The plants are not more than a metre in height and about 60 centimetres in width.

==Food uses==
The bush bears small sized seeds and one can pluck them once the plant/bush is very dry. Not more than 5 to 8 grams of Zeera can be plucked from each bush, contributing to the high price of $ 2 per 10 gms(1987 rates).  

The small, rounded [[taproot]] is edible raw or cooked, and said to taste like sweet [[chestnut]]s.{{cn}} The leaf can be used as an [[herb]] or [[garnish (food)|garnish]] similar to [[parsley]].

The seeds are most valued as a garnish to high value, very special [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] dishes, they should not be ground as their flavour would be reduced.
