== Live performances ==

== Critical reception ==
"My Nigga" was met with generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked "My Nigga" number 30 on their list of the 50 best songs of 2013. They commented saying, "To YG fans, it may have come as a surprise that "My Nigga" took off the way it did. After all, dude had been making comparable if not better and catchier songs with DJ Mustard for years. Somehow though, the stars aligned for this one, and by stars we mean Rich Homie Quan and Young Jeezy. Having catapulted himself to the forefront of catchy-hook stardom with [[Type of Way|that song about vague emotional responses to jealousy]], Quan was able to strike again while the iron was still hot with the "My Nigga" chorus. YG himself switches up his own flow for this one, sing-rapping through his ode to his fellow man. Young Jeezy comes through as the older brother to shine his veteran sense of camaraderie onto the young bucks, and it feels genuine. Having one of Mustard's meanest beats set the didn't hurt, either."<ref>http://www.complex.com/music/2013/12/best-songs-of-2013/yg-young-jeezy-rich-homie-quan-my-nigga</ref>
