The '''Soviet ruble''' or '''rouble''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0440><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+044C>}}; see below for other [[Languages of the Soviet Union|languages of the USSR]]) was the [[currency]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. One ruble is divided into 100 kopeks, (also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as kopecks or copecks {{lang-ru|<U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0301><U+0439><U+043A><U+0430>, pl. <U+043A><U+043E><U+043F><U+0435><U+0301><U+0439><U+043A><U+0438>}} - ''kopeyka'', ''kopeyki'').

In addition to standard banknotes, the Soviet ruble was available in the form of ''foreign rubles'' ({{lang-ru|<U+0438><U+043D><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B><U+044E><U+0442><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0440><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+044C>}}); also, several forms of virtual rubles were used for inter-enterprise accounting and international settlement in the [[Comecon]] zone.<ref>{{et icon}} [[eestimajandus.ee]]: [http://www.eestimajandus.ee/moodul.php?moodul=CMS&Komponent=Lehed&id=47&sm_id=193 "NSV Liidu valuutas<U+00FC>steem ja esimesed <U+00FC>hisettev<U+00F5>tted"]</ref> Many of the ruble designs were created by [[Ivan Dubasov]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Ruble}}
The word "ruble" is derived from the [[Slavic language|Slavic]] verb ''<U+0440><U+0443><U+0431><U+0438><U+0442><U+044C>'', ''rubit<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', i.e., to chop. Historically, "ruble" was a piece of a certain weight chopped off a [[silver]] [[ingot]] ([[grivna]]), hence the name.

==Ruble in the Soviet Union==
The Soviet currency had its own name in all [[Languages of the Soviet Union|Soviet languages]], sometimes quite different from its Russian designation. All banknotes had the currency name and their nominal printed in the languages of every [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]]. This naming is preserved in modern Russia; for example: [[Tatar language|Tatar]] for ''ruble'' and ''kopek'' are ''sum'' and ''tien''. The current names of several currencies of [[Central Asia]] are simply the local names of the ruble. Finnish last appeared on 1947 banknotes since the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]] was dissolved in 1956.

The name of the currency in the official languages of the 15 republics, in the order they appeared in the banknotes:

==Historical Soviet rubles==
===First Soviet ruble===
The first ruble issued for the Socialist government was a preliminary issue still based on the previous issue of the ruble prior to the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917. They are all in banknote form and started their issue in 1919. At this time other issues were made by the [[White movement|white Russian government]] and other governing bodies.
Denominations are as follows: 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 60, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000. Short term treasury certificate were also issued to supplement banknote issue in 1 million, 5 million, 10 million rubles. These issue was printed in various fashions, as inflation crept up the security features were few and some were printed on one side, as was the case for the German inflationary notes.

===Second Soviet ruble, January 1, 1922 - December 31, 1922===
[[Image:1 rouble of 1922.jpg|thumb|200px||right|Silver ruble of 1922]]
In 1922, the first of several redenominations took place, at a rate of 1 "new" ruble for 10,000 "old" rubles. The [[Russian chervonets|chervonets]] (<U+0447><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+043E><U+043D><U+0435><U+0446>) was also introduced in 1922.

===Third Soviet ruble, January 1, 1923 - March 6, 1924===
A second redenomination took place in 1923, at a rate of 100 to 1. Again, only paper money was issued. During the lifetime of this currency, the first money of the [[Soviet Union]] was issued.

===Fourth (Gold) Soviet ruble, March 7, 1924 - 1947===

A third redenomination in 1924 introduced the "gold" ruble at a value of 50,000 rubles of the previous issue. This reform also saw the ruble linked to the [[chervonets]], at a value of 10 rubles. Coins began to be issued again in 1924, whilst paper money was issued in rubles for values below 10 rubles and in chervonets for higher denominations.

===Fifth Soviet ruble, 1947 - 1961===
Following World War II, the Soviet government implemented a confiscatory redenomination of the currency (decreed on December 14, 1947) to reduce the amount of money in circulation.  The main purpose of this change was to prevent peasants who had accumulated cash by selling food at wartime prices from using this to buy consumer goods as the postwar recovery took hold.<ref>''An Economic History of the U.S.S.R.'' by [[Alexander Nove|Alec Nove]] (ISBN 0-14-021403-8), pp. 283, 310.</ref> Old rubles were revalued at one tenth of their face value.  This mainly affected paper money in the hands of private individuals.  Amounts of 3,000 rubles or less in individual bank accounts were not revalued, while salaries remained the same.

===Sixth Soviet ruble, 1961 - 1991===
[[Image:Soviet Union-1989-Coin-0.50.jpg|thumb|right|200px|50 kopek type issued 1961-1991.]]
[[Image:SovietOlympicCoins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two 10 ruble coins introduced in 1978 to commemorate the 1980 Summer Olympics]]
The 1961 redenomination was a repeat of the 1947 reform, with the same terms applying.{{clarify|date=October 2010}} Newly designed notes were issued with artwork by the artist [[Victor Tsigal]] depicting scenes from Soviet life and Soviet industrial achievements. The Soviet ruble of 1961 was formally equal to 0.987412&nbsp;gram of [[gold]], but the exchange for gold was never available to the general public. This ruble maintained parity with the [[Pound Sterling]] until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 when the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] became the new currency of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].

==Economic role==
The [[economy of the Soviet Union]] was a government-controlled [[planned economy]], where the government controlled prices and the exchange of currency. Thus, its role was unlike that of a currency in a market economy, because distribution of goods was controlled by other mechanisms than currency, such as centrally planned quotas, queuing or [[Blat (term)|blat]]. Only a limited set of products could be freely bought, thus the ruble had a role similar to [[trading stamp]]s or [[food stamp]]s. The currency was not internationally exchangeable and its export was illegal. The sudden transformation from a Soviet "non-currency" into a market currency contributed to the economic hardship following the collapse of the Soviet planned economy.<ref>see Ilmari Susiluoto</ref>

==Replacement currencies in the former Soviet republics==

Shortly after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, local currencies were introduced in the newly independent states. Most of the new economies were weak and hence most of the currencies have undergone significant reforms since launch that included change of names and denominations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In the very beginning of the post-Soviet economic transition, quite a lot of people{{Who|date=April 2009}} and institutions (including the [[International Monetary Fund]]) believed in the possibility to maintain the common [[currency]] working for all or at least for some of the former Soviet Union<U+2019>s countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Political considerations were one reason for this advocacy. Certain politicians were hoping to rebuild the former Russian empire in some way, or at the very least, maintain "special relations" among former Soviet republics, or the "[[near abroad]]" as they came to be known in Russia. Another reason were the economical considerations for maintaining the ruble zone. The wish to preserve the strong trade relations between former Soviet republics was considered the most important goal.{{Who|date=April 2009}}

The break-up of the Soviet Union was not accompanied by any formal changes in monetary arrangements. The Central Bank of Russia was authorized to take over the State Bank of the USSR ([[Gosbank]]) on 1 January 1992. It continued to ship USSR ruble notes and coins to the central banks of the fourteen newly independent countries, which had formerly been the main branches of Gosbank in the republics.

The political situation, however, was not favorable for maintaining a common currency.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Maintaining a common currency requires a strong political consensus in respect to monetary and fiscal targets, a common institution in charge of implementing these targets, and some minimum of common legislation (concerning the banking and foreign exchange regulations). These conditions were far from being met amidst the turbulent economic and political situation.

During the first half of 1992, a monetary union with 15 independent states all using the ruble existed. Since it was clear that the situation would not last, each of them was using its position as "free-riders" to issue huge amounts of money in the form of credit (since Russia held the monopoly on printing banknotes and coins). Ukraine was very active in this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} As a result, some countries were issuing coupons in order to "protect" their markets from buyers from other states. The Russian central bank responded in July 1992 by setting up restrictions to the flow of credit between Russia and other states. The final collapse of the ruble zone began with the exchange of banknotes by the Central bank of Russia on Russian territory at the end of July 1993. As a result, other countries still in the ruble zone ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Moldova]], [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) were "pushed out".{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By November 1993 all newly independent states had introduced their own currencies, with the exception of war-torn [[Tajikistan]] (May 1995) and unrecognized [[Transnistria]] (1994).

Details on the introduction of new currencies in the newly independent states are discussed below.

===Kyrgyzstan===
Kyrgyzstan decided to leave the ruble zone, because it considered the Russian monetary policy to be too inflationary; which was not good for stabilizing the economy. Kyrgyzstan introduced its own currency (the [[Kyrgyzstani_som|som]]) on 10 May 1993. The first issue consisted of banknotes of 0.01; 0.10; 0.50; 1; 5 and 20 Som. After a period of dual circulation the som became the only legal tender, on 15 May. New series of banknotes were introduced in 1994 and 1997. Starting in January 2008, low denomination banknotes were phased out and replaced by coins.

===Latvia===
Latvia was the first country to introduce its own currency: the [[Latvian ruble]], introduced May 7, 1992, on par with the Soviet ruble and circulated parallel with it; on July 20, it became the sole legal tender.<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, ''Britannica book of the year: 1993'', p649</ref> It was the second country to leave the ruble zone entirely. Latvia decided to leave the ruble zone, because it considered the Russian monetary policy to be too inflationary; which was not good for stabilizing the economy. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Latvia declared independence on 4 May 1990, this was, however, not formally recognized by the Soviet Union until 25 December 1991. On 3 September 1991 the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia passed a resolution to restore the status of the [[Bank of Latvia]] to that of a central bank, with the exclusive right to issue the national currency.

In the first four months of 1992 Latvia was adversely affected by the inflation of the ruble. In addition, the outgoing cash payments (with other ex-USSR states) surpassed the incoming money amounts by 122 million rubles (5.9%) in February and in April by 686 million rubles (29.2%), thus causing a very serious shortage of cash. Since money was issued by Russia, the Bank of Latvia was unable to improve the cash circulation in the country. The situation completely depended on the possibility of receiving or buying cash and credit resources from the Russian central bank. It was evident that a crisis could develop, in which the Bank of Latvia would not be able to execute even the most necessary payments.

Thus the Monetary Reform Committee of the Republic of Latvia was established, and on 4 May 1992 it passed the resolution on introducing a new temporary currency: the Latvian ruble. Notes were issued on 7 May in the following denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 500 rubles. They were exchanged at par with Soviet rubles. Until 20 July both currencies circulated together, at that day the Soviet ruble ceased to be legal tender and Latvia left the ruble zone entirely.

The Latvian ruble was however intended as a temporary currency. It was gradually replaced by the new national currency (the lats). This process started on 5 March 1993 with the introduction of the 5 lats-banknote and would be completed on 20 July 1998, with the 500 lats-banknote.

The successful reform ending in the introduction of the lats facilitated Latvia<U+2019>s transition to a stable [[market economy]].

===Uzbekistan===
Uzbekistan was "pushed out" of the Ruble zone as a consequence of the July 1993 introduction of new banknotes in Russia.

Uzbekistan introduced a temporary national currency (the som) on 15 November 1993. It replaced the ruble at a rate of 1:1. Between July and November 1993 old and new ruble notes circulated together.  On 1 July 1994 the temporary som was replaced by a new, permanent, version of the som. Old notes were exchanged at a rate of 1.000 to 1. At its introduction 7 som were equal to 1 United States dollar.
