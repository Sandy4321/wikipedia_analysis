'''Juliusz S<U+0142>owacki''' ({{IPA-pol|<U+02C8>julju<U+0282> sw<U+0254><U+02C8>vatski}}; 4 September 1809 &ndash; 3 April 1849) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[Romantic poet]]. He is considered to be one of the "[[Three Bards]]" of [[Polish literature]], a major figure of the [[Romanticism in Poland|Polish Romantic period]] and the father of modern Polish [[drama]]. His works often feature elements of [[Slavic mythology|Slavic pagan traditions]], [[history of Poland|Polish history]], [[mysticism]] and [[Orientalism]]. His style relied on [[neologism]]s and [[irony]]. His primary genre was the [[drama]], and second, [[lyrical poetry]]. Among his most popular works are the dramas ''[[Kordian]]'' and ''[[Balladyna (drama)|Balladyna]]'' and the poem ''[[Beniowski]]''.

S<U+0142>owacki spent his youth in [[Kremenets]] (Krzemieniec) and [[Vilnius]] (Wilno). He briefly worked for the [[Congress Poland]] government, and during the [[November Uprising]] he was a courier for the [[Polish National Government (November Uprising) }Polish revolutionary government]]. He found himself abroad when the uprising ended in defeat, and since then he lived the life of an <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>, like [[Great Emigration|many of his compatriots]]. He settled briefly in [[Paris]], [[France]], and later [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. He also traveled through [[Italy]], [[Greece]] and the [[Middle East]]. Eventually he returned to Paris, where he spent the last decade of his life. He briefly returned to Poland when [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|another uprising]] broke out during the [[Spring of Nations]].

===Emigration===
Like [[Great Emigration|many of his countrymen]], S<U+0142>owacki decided to stay in [[France]] as a political refugee.<ref name=alma/> In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (''Mindowe'' and ''Maria Stuart'').<ref name=alma/><ref name=polona/> He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand.<ref name=polona/> However, S<U+0142>owacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under [[partitions of Poland|foreign occupation]].<ref name=bioMK/> In 1832, antagonized by poor reception of his works among the Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, S<U+0142>owacki left on a trip to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].<ref name="Murray2004"/> The French authorities denied him the right to return to France as part of a larger program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.<ref name=bioMK/> From 1833 to 1836 he lived in Switzerland.<ref name=polona/> A third volume of his poems, published in 1833 and containing works from the period of the Uprising, was far more nationalist in tone, and won more recognition in his homeland.<ref name=bioMK/> At the same time, he wrote several works featuring romantic themes, and beautiful scenery, such as ''W Szwajcarii'' (''In Switzerland''), ''Roz<U+0142><U+0105>czenie'' (''Separation''), ''Stokr<U+00F3>tki'' (''Daisies'') and ''Chmury'' (''Clouds'').<ref name=bioMK/><ref name=polona/><ref name=mikos/><ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/> In 1834 he published the drama ''[[Kordian]]'', a romantic drama, illustrating the soul searching of the Polish people in the aftermath of the failed insurrection; this work is considered one of his best creations.<ref name=alma/><ref name="Murray2004">{{cite book|author=Christopher John Murray|title=Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bXnMs-YDEF4C&pg=PA624|accessdate=10 February 2011|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781579584238|pages=1059-1061}}</ref><ref name=bioMK/><ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/>

In 1836, S<U+0142>owacki left Switzerland and embarked on a journey that started in [[Italy]].<ref name=polona/> In [[Rome]] he met and befriended [[Zygmunt Krasi<U+0144>ski]], the third of the [[Three Bards]].<ref name=sm1>{{pl icon}} Stanis<U+0142>aw Makowski (1985), ''Juliusz S<U+0142>owacki'', in: ''Literatura polska.

In 1840 Mickiewicz was elected to the position of professor of [[Slavic literature]] at [[Coll<U+00E9>ge de France]]; it was one of the events that cemented his position over S<U+0142>owacki in the Polish <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> community.<ref name=polona/> The rivalry between the two Bards for primacy would continue till the ends of lives.<ref name=polona/> In 1841 S<U+0142>owacki traveled briefly to [[Frankfurt]], but Paris would become his main home till his death.<ref name=alma/> In 1840 and 1841 he wrote two notable dramas: ''Mazepa'', the only of his dramas that was put on stage during his lifetime, and ''Fantazy'', published posthumously, well-received by critics.<ref name="Murray2004"/> Over the next few years S<U+0142>owacki wrote and published many works, including ''Testament M<U+00F3>j'' (''My Last Will''), in which he described his faith that his works would endure after his death.<ref name=polona/><ref name="Murray2004">{{cite book|author=Christopher John Murray|title=Encyclopedia of the romantic era, 1760-1850|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wgS2nYRIuUEC&pg=PA1059|accessdate=11 February 2011|year=2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9781579584221|pages=1059<U+2013>}}</ref> Between 1841 and 1846, he published ''Beniowski'', considered by some his best lyrical poetry.<ref name="Murray2004"/><ref name=bioMK/><ref name=mikos/> Starting as a story of a historical figure, it developed into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions.<ref name=mikos/> In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, ''Ko<U+0142>o Sprawy Bo<U+017C>ej'' (Circle of God's Cause), led by [[Andrzej Towia<U+0144>ski]].<ref name=polona/> This group included, among others, Mickiewicz.<ref name=polona/> Towia<U+0144>ski's influence is credited with a new, mystical current in S<U+0142>owacki's works, seen in works such as the poem ''Beniowski'' and the drama ''Ksi<U+0105>dz Marek'' (''Father Mark'').<ref name=polona/> S<U+0142>owacki left the Circle a year later, in 1843.<ref name=polona/> 

In the summers of 1843 and 1844 S<U+0142>owacki traveled to [[Pornic]], a resort on the Atlantic coast in [[Brittany]].<ref name=polona/><ref name=alma/> It was there, in 1844, that he wrote ''[[Genezis z Ducha]]'' (''Genesis from the Spirit'').<ref name=polona/> This work introduced his own philosophical system that would have a visible influence on his works in his last decade.<ref name=bioMK/><ref name=mikos/> Around 1839 S<U+0142>owacki put his capital into the Parisian [[stock market]].<ref name=Rym-7-11>{{pl icon}} {{cite book|author=Jaros<U+0142>aw Marek Rymkiewicz|title=S<U+0142>owacki: encyklopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=K6sXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 February 2011|year=2004|publisher=Sic!|isbn=9788388807589|pages=7-11}}</ref> He was a shrewd investor who earned enough from the investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.<ref name=Rym-7-11/>

===Last years===
In the late 1840s S<U+0142>owacki attached himself to a group of like-minded young exiles, determined to return to Poland and win its independence.<ref name=bioMK/> One of his friends was the pianist and composer [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]].<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.554529&catNum=554529&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Chopin: Complete Piano Music Vol. 3, Mazurkas Vol. 1]</ref> Others included enthusiasts of his work, such as [[Zygmunt Szcz<U+0119>sny Feli<U+0144>ski]], [[J<U+00F3>zef Alojzy Reitzenheim]] and [[J<U+00F3>zef Komierowski]].<ref name=polona/> Despite poor health, when he heard about the events of the [[Spring of Nations]], S<U+0142>owacki traveled with some friends to [[Pozna<U+0144>]], then under [[Prussian partition|Prussian control]], hoping to participate in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Wielkopolska Uprising]] of 1848.<ref name=alma/><ref name=polona/> He addressed the [[Polish National Committee (1848)|National Committee]] (Komitet Narodowy) in Pozna<U+0144> on 27 April.<ref name=polona/> "I tell you," he declared as the rebels faced military confrontation with the Prussian Army, "that the new age has dawned, the age of holy [[Anarchism|anarchy]]." But by 9&nbsp;May, the revolt was crushed.

Arrested by the Prussian police, S<U+0142>owacki was sent back to Paris.<ref name=alma/> On his way there, he passed through [[Wroc<U+0142>aw]], where in mid-June he was reunited with his mother, whom he had not seen for almost twenty years.<ref name=alma/> He returned to Paris in July 1848.<ref name=alma/> His poem ''Papie<U+017C> S<U+0142>owia<U+0144>ski'' (''The Slavic Pope''), published in late 1848, gained new fame a century later when it seemed to foretell the 1978 ascent of Karol Wojty<U+0142>a to the throne of St. Peter as [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref name=focushist/><ref name=polona/> His final dramas (''Zawisza Czarny'', ''Samuel Zborowski''), attempted to  explain [[history of Poalnd]] through S<U+0142>owacki's genesic philosophy.<ref name=bioMK/> In March 1849 S<U+0142>owacki, his health failing, was visited three times by another Polish writer and poet, [[Cyprian Norwid]], who later wrote about his visits in ''Czarne kwiaty'' (''Black Flowers'').<ref name=polona/><ref name=bioMK/> Up to his final days, S<U+0142>owacki was writing poetry; a day before his death he dictated passages of his final work, ''Kr<U+00F3>l-Duch'' (''King-Spirit'').<ref name=polona/> This grandiose, visionary-symbolic poem, "summary of the entire Romantic culture", S<U+0142>owacki's masterpiece, weaving together Poland's history and its contemporary political and literary thought, was never finished.<ref name=bioMK/><ref name=polona/>

S<U+0142>owacki died in Paris on 3 April 1849 from [[tuberculosis]], and on 5 April he was buried in the [[Montmartre Cemetery]] in Paris.<ref name=alma/> He never married.<ref name=polona/> Only about 30 people attended his funeral.<ref name=alma/> Krasi<U+0144>ski, although estranged from S<U+0142>owacki in the last few years,<ref name=polona4/> wrote of the funeral:

{{cquote|There were 30 compatriots at the funeral <U+2013> nobody rose to speak, nobody uttered even one word to honour the memory of the greatest master of Polish rhymes<ref name=polona/>}}

S<U+0142>owacki's tombstone at Montmartre was designed by his friend and executor of his [[last will]], painter [[Charles P<U+00E9>tiniaud-Dubos]]; it did not weather the passage of time well however, and in 1851 a new, similar tombstone was put in place, this one designed by Polish sculptor [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Oleszczy<U+0144>ski]].<ref name=alma/> In 1927 S<U+0142>owacki's remains were moved to [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Poland, but an empty grave still remains at Montmartre.<ref>{{pl icon}} Marek Troszy<U+0144>ski, [http://archiwum.wiz.pl/1999/99113900.asp <U+015A>LADAMI S<U+0141>OWACKIEGO], Wiedza i <U+017B>ycie, 1999</ref>

Polish historian of literature [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Szturc]] divides S<U+0142>owacki's work into four periods: Wolter's circle (pseudoclassicism), Christian ethic, Towia<U+0144>ski's ethic and genesic ethic.<ref>{{pl icon}} W<U+0142>odzimierz Szturc (1997), ''O obrotach sfer romantycznych.

S<U+0142>owacki's works, situated in the period of [[romanticism in Poland]], contain rich and inventive vocabulary, including many [[neologism]]s.<ref name="Hochman1984"/><ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/> They use [[fantasy]], [[mysticism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and feature themes related to [[history of Poland|Poland's history]], essence of Polishness, and relation to a larger universe.<ref name="Hochman1984"/> <U+0141>awski, enumerating the main characteristics of S<U+0142>owacki's writings, notes first that he was a "creationist", in the sense of creating new meanings and words (many of his characters bear names he invented himself, such as Kordian<ref name="S<U+0151>t<U+00E9>rNeupokoeva1977">{{cite book|author1=Istv<U+00E1>n S<U+0151>t<U+00E9>r|author2=Irina Grigor<U+02B9>evna Neupokoeva|title=European romanticism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6IlZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 February 2011|year=1977|publisher=Akad<U+00E9>miai Kiad<U+00F3> : distributed by Kultura|isbn=9789630512220|pages=239}}</ref>).<ref name=polona2/> Second, he notes that S<U+0142>owacki was not only inspired by works of others, from poets and writers to scholars and philosophers, but that his texts were often a masterful, ironic-grotesque [[polemic]] with other creators.<ref name=polona2/><ref name="King2007"/> For example, S<U+0142>owacki was so impressed by [[Antoni Malczewski]]'s ''Maria'' that he wrote a sequel to it, ''Jan Bielecki''.<ref name=polona2/> Likewise, ''Kordian'' is seen as building on [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'',<ref name="King2007">{{cite book|author=Kimball King|title=Western Drama Through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F8s_VTNuqU4C&pg=PA216|accessdate=12 February 2011|date=30 June 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313329340|pages=216<U+2013>}}</ref> and as S<U+0142>owacki's response to Mickiewicz's ''[[Dziady]]''.<ref name="Murray2004"/><ref name=gazeta>{{pl icon}} Agnieszka Szurek, [http://kordian.lektury.gazeta.pl/lektury/1,91399,5413645,Kordian.html Kordian], gazeta.pl, 2008-07-01</ref> This <U+0141>awski calls "ivy-like imagination", comparing S<U+0142>owacki's approach to that of an [[ivy]], growing around works of others and reshaping them into new forms in a sophisticated literary game.<ref name=polona2/> Third, S<U+0142>owacki was a master of [[irony]]; he used it not only on others, but on himself, and even on irony itself - the "irony of irony".<ref name=polona2/> He is thus seen as one of the forerunners to the literature of irony and grotesque, popular in the 20th century.<ref name=polona4/>

After his death, S<U+0142>owacki acquired the reputation of a national prophet.<ref name=polona4/> He is now considered to be one of the "[[Three Bards]]" (''wieszczs'') of [[Polish literature]].<ref>{{pl icon}} [http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3996041 wieszcz], [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]]</ref><ref name=polona/>

After his death, however, S<U+0142>owacki gained a cult-like status in Poland; in particular, in the cultural center of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<ref name=alma/> Several [[obituary|obituaries]] and longer articles appeared in the Polish press upon S<U+0142>owacki's death.<ref name=alma/> His works, many of them published posthumously for the first time, found growing acceptance among a new generation; an 1868 work noted that "S<U+0142>owacki took the fancy of the Polish youth. He was its singer, its spiritual leader in the full meaning of the term".<ref name=polona3/> Through undoubtedly a poet of the [[Romantic poetry|romantic era]], he was increasingly popular among the [[Positivism in Poland|positivists]] and the authors of the [[Young Poland]] period in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<ref name=polona3/><ref name="Hochman1984"/> His works were popularized by other writers, such as [[Adam Asnyk]] and [[Micha<U+0142> Ba<U+0142>ucki]], and his dramas were shown in theaters.<ref name=alma/> He became a major literary figure for the new generation of Polish writers.<ref name=alma/> He also became respected abroad; a 1902 [[English language]] book edited by [[Charles Dudley Warner]] noted that "the splendid exuberance of his thought and fancy ranks him among the great poets of the nineteenth century". <ref name="WarnerRunkle1902"/>

In 1927, some eight years after Poland regained her independence, the Polish government arranged for S<U+0142>owacki's remains be moved to [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<ref name=burial>{{pl icon}} Anna Agaciak, ''[http://www.polskatimes.pl/stronaglowna/244126,wielkie-spory-o-narodowy-panteon,id,t.html?cookie=1#material_2 Wielkie spory o narodowy panteon]'', Polska Times, 2010-04-13</ref><ref name=alma/> He was interred in the [[Crypt of National Bards]], together with Mickiewicz.<ref name=burial/> His burial in the Wawel Cathedral was a controversial issue, as many of his works were considered [[Heresy|heretic]]al by Polish Catholic Church officials.<ref name=focushist/><ref name=alma/> It took almost two decades and the backing of [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]], for whom S<U+0142>owacki was a favorite poet, to get the Church's acceptance for interring S<U+0142>owacki's remains in the Wawel Cathedral.<ref name=burial/><ref name=alma/><ref name=focushist>{{pl icon}} ''[http://www.focus.pl/historia/artykuly/zobacz/publikacje/slowacki-heretyk-krolom-rowny/strona-publikacji/2/nc/1/ S<U+0142>owacki.
