'''''Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One''''', alternatively titled ''Kinks Part One: Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround'', is a [[concept album]] by [[British rock]] band [[The Kinks]], recorded and released in [[1970 in music|1970]].<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs.">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:kxfyxqesldte|title=Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> 

The album is a satirical look at the various facets of the music industry, including song publishers ("Denmark Street"), [[labor union|unions]] ("Get Back in Line"), the [[News media|press]] and the hit-making machine ("Top of the Pops"), [[accountant]]s and [[business manager]]s ("The Moneygoround") and the road ("This Time Tomorrow").<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/> Musically, ''Lola Versus Powerman'' is varied, contrasting gentle ballads like "Get Back in Line" and "A Long Way From Home" against [[hard rock]] songs like "[[Rats (Dave Davies song)|Rats]]" and "Powerman", with "Denmark Street" and "The Moneygoround" paying homage to the English [[music hall]] tradition.<ref name="JR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.jr.com/product/music/pm/_116952/#productTabCredits|title=Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround|publisher=J&R|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="paper">{{cite web|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/misc/paper-DiBlasi-LolaVsPowerman.pdf|title=''Lola versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One''|last=DiBlasi|first=Alex|publisher=Kindakinks.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/>

It came during a period of transition for the band, as not only members of their lineup changed, but their look and musical style changed as well. It was a success both critically and commercially for the group, charting in the Top 40 in America<ref name="Charts">{{cite web|url=http://www.kindakinks.net/charts.html|title=International Chart Positions|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> and helping restore them in the public eye, making ''Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround'' a "comeback" album. It contained two hit [[Single (music)|single]]s, "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]", which reached the top 10 in the US and UK, and "[[Apeman (song)|Apeman]]", which peaked at number five in the UK.<ref name="Charts"/>

1970 was a hectic year for the Kinks. They had been subject to a ban from the [[American Federation of Musicians]], who had refused permits for the group to perform in America since 1965.<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T1|title=The Kinks|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="Who Let">Alterman, Loraine. ''Who Let the Kinks In?''. [[Rolling Stone]], 18 December 1969</ref> When this ban was lifted in 1969, the group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene<ref name="Hinman 132a">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp. 132-140</ref> However, members of the band fell ill, and their US tour was shuffled, <ref name="Hinman 132a"/> as they only managed to play a few dates in America and Canada. <ref name="Hinman 132a"/> A follow-up tour in 1970 met with similar results, with the group performing only at a select number of venues, with many dates canceled.<ref name="Hinman 137">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 137</ref> The down time between the tours allowed [[Ray Davies]], [[Lead vocalist|lead singer]] and [[songwriter]] of the group, to carefully craft the band's next single, "Lola".<ref name="All Day">Hinman, Doug (2004). pp. 137<U+2013>145</ref>

The Kinks returned to England to start work on their new LP in spring 1970.<ref name="Hinman 140">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 137</ref> The group began using a different recording studio, Morgan Studios, in [[Willesden]], [[London]].<ref name="Hinman 140"/> Morgan was an independent studio, and the Kinks would continue recording their albums there until ''Preservation'', when they switched to their newly-purchased studio, [[Konk (recording)|Konk]].<ref name="All Day"/> Recording began in late April/early May.<ref name="Hinman 140" /> Some of the first songs recorded were "Lola", the outtake "Good Good Life", "Powerman" and "[[Got to Be Free]]".<ref name="Hinman 140"/> The sessions for "Lola" were especially long, and the recording continued into late May. Davies would recall later how he achieved the signature clangy sound at the beginning of the track:
[[Image:Resonator Style0.jpg|thumb|right|140px|alt=A metal guitar lies flat on its back, vertically aligned and on top of a grey background.|A National Steel resonator guitar]]
{{cquote|"I remember going into a music store on Shaftesbury Avenue in London when we were about to make 'Lola'. I said, 'I want to get a really good guitar sound on this record. I want a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]].' And in the corner they had this old 1938 [[dobro]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[resonator guitar]], in this case a [[National String Instrument Corporation|National Steel]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> that I bought for $150. I put them together on 'Lola' which is what makes that clangy sound: the combination of the Martin and the dobro with heavy compression."<ref name="Hinman 140"/>}}

The National Steel would play an integral part in many Kinks projects after that. In the 1972 song "[[Supersonic Rocket Ship]]", Ray Davies would use the guitar to create a [[Caribbean]] feel for the record. Davies would play it on numerous "[[Top of The Pops]]" appearances, and it would be featured in several music videos the Kinks made in the future, including "Scattered" in 1992.<ref name="Music Video">The Kinks: ''Phobia'', "Scattered" music video, 1992 <U+2013> [[Columbia Records]].</ref> 

Keyboardist [[John Gosling]] was added to the Kinks' lineup in May.<ref name="Rogan 75">Rogan, Johnny (Omnibus, 1998). p. 141</ref> He auditioned on the final backing master track for "Lola", and was hired soon after. He was initially taken on solely for their upcoming US tour, but his post evolved into a more permanent position soon after. Gosling would remain with the band until 1977, departing after the release of ''[[Sleepwalker (The Kinks album)|Sleepwalker]]''.<ref name="Hinman 140"/> Dubbing for "Lola" was finished in June.<ref name="Hinman 141">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 141</ref> Recording for the LP was completed by October, and it was mixed throughout the remainder of the month.<ref name="Hinman 145">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 145</ref> ''Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One'' was released on 27 November 1970.

===Controversies and dubbing===
For "Lola", Ray Davies was forced to overdub the trademarked word "[[Coca-Cola]]" with the generic "cherry-cola" for the single release, as [[product placement]] rules meant the [[BBC]] (being a [[Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom|public service broadcaster]]) would not have played it.<ref name="Hinman 141"/><ref name="SongFact>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1158 "Songfacts"] listing for "Lola"</ref> Although the lyrics in the gatefold sleeve of the original LP use the "cherry-cola" line, the album actually contains the original "Coca-Cola" version. A similar situation was encountered with the song "Apeman", concerning the line "the air pollution is a-foggin' up my eyes".<ref name="Hinman 141"/> "Fogging" was mistaken for "Fucking", and consequently Ray Davies had to re-record this line prior to its single release.<ref name="Hinman 141"/>

== Songs ==
The album opens with a 40-second "Introduction", which is a reverse reprise of the last track on the album, "Got to Be Free".<ref name="paper"/> Like "Got to Be Free", this song features light instrumentation reminiscent of [[country music|country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] styles.<ref name="paper"/><ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/> "The Contenders" is the next track on ''Lola Versus Powerman''.<ref name="Album Notes (Reprise, 2004)">Album Notes (Reprise, 2004)</ref> It is sometimes credited as the first; however, the "Introduction" is often billed as "Track One" as well.<ref name="Album Notes (Reprise, 2004)"/> The song features a hard blues guitar sound and riff.

"[[Strangers (song)|Strangers]]" is the first of two [[Dave Davies]] compositions on ''Lola Versus Powerman''.<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/><ref name="Album Notes (Reprise, 2004)"/> It is an acoustic number that is augmented by [[Mick Avory]]'s drum beat and [[John Gosling]]'s organ. Davies said in his autobiography, ''Kink'', that the song was at least partially inspired by his brother, Ray, as well as his general feelings of hopelessness and confusion at this turning point in the band's career.<ref name="Kink">Davies, Dave (1994). pp. 132-133</ref>

"Denmark Street" takes a look at the music publishing companies of [[Denmark Street]] in [[Soho, London]].<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/> Ray Davies was at this time in a legal dispute with several publishing companies, which would eventually result in a lowering of his [[Royalties|royalty]] rate.<ref name="All Day"/> Many of these experiences are expressed throughout this tune.<ref name="paper"/> 

"Get Back in the Line",<ref name="Album Notes (Reprise, 2004)"/> concerns unions and working-class life. It tells the story of a man who is down and out of luck, and his feelings towards his situation in working-class life,<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/> as shown in these lines: "Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by/ Will I go to work today or shall I bide my time/
'Cos when I see that union man walking down the street/
He's the man who decides if I live or I die, if I starve, or I eat"

The song "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]" is about an encounter with a [[transvestism|transvestite]].<ref name="Lola 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:wvfrxvegldfe|title="Lola"|last=Gilliam|first=Richard|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> Encouraged by his father, Davies consciously and carefully crafted the song to be a hit after a long dry spell for the band on both the UK and US charts.<ref name="All Day"/> The band made several different takes throughout April 1970, all at various speeds and in different keys. John Dalton would later recall that the recording of "Lola" took a very long time and was especially stressful and taxing on the group.<ref name="Hinman 140">Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 140</ref> However, upon the release of the single, "Lola" became one of the Kinks' biggest hits, and reached the Top 5 in the UK and the Top 10 in the US.<ref name="Charts"/>

"Top of the Pops" is another song concerning the music business, this time focusing on charts and the hit-making machine.<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/> The song has a [[hard rock]] feel, similar to "Rats" and "Powerman".<ref name="Rogan a"/> It would later become a concert staple for the Kinks, and version can be found on the live half of their double LP ''[[Everybody's In Show-Biz]]''.<ref name="TOTP Lyrics">Lyrics for "Top of the Pops" [http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php?song=409 Link], on Kindakinks.net. Retrieved 1 December 2009</ref>

"The Moneygoround", another "music business" song, features heavy [[music hall]] and [[folk music|folk]] roots. At 1:47, it is the shortest song on the album apart from "Introduction".<ref name="Allmusic Lola Vs."/>
The song criticizes the circulation of money in the music business: "Do they all deserve money from a song that they've never heard/
They don't know the tune and they don't know the words/
But they don't give a damn/
There's no end to it I'm in a pit and I'm stuck in it"<ref name="TOTP Lyrics"/>

"This Time Tomorrow" is one of the better known songs on the album, having been featured in several movies, including ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''.<ref name="IMDB Darjeeling"/> It is about life on the road and travel, which was wearing heavily on the Kinks in 1970, as they returned to American touring.<ref name="Hinman 137"/> Similar sentiments are expressed on their album "Everybody<U+2019>s in Show-Biz".<ref name="Everybody">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:39ftxqqdldte|title=Everybody's In Show-Biz|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> 

"A Long Way From Home", is a quiet number, and at only 2:27 in length is one of the shorter tracks off the album.<ref name="Rogan a"/> It has become a popular song on Ray Davies' recent tours. Davies performed the song at Austin City Limits in 2004.<ref name="ACL">[http://www.kindakinks.net/misc/review-20060724.html Kindakinks.net] Review and set list, on Kindakinks.net, Retrieved 1 December 2009</ref> 

"[[Rats (Dave Davies song)|Rats]]", the tenth song on the album, is the second song on the LP written and sung by Dave Davies.<ref name="Rogan a">Rogan, Johnny (1998). p. 60-80</ref> It features a heavy [[proto-punk]] sound, carried with a power-chord riff. The song was used as the B-side to "Apeman".<ref name="Rogan 79"/>

"[[Apeman (song)|Apeman]]" was released as a single in the fall of 1970.<ref name="Rogan 79"/> While it did not do as well on the U.S. Pop Singles chart as its predecessor, "Lola", it was a hit in the UK, peaking at number five on the singles chart.<ref name="Charts"/> 

"Powerman" features a hard rock sound, as well as shared vocals from both of the Davies brothers.<ref name="Rogan 79">Rogan, Johnny (1998). p. 79</ref> 

"[[Got to Be Free]]" is the last song on the album.<ref name="All Day"/> It opens as a lullaby ("Hush little baby/Don't you cry"), the same lyrics and tune as the album's introduction on side A, but soon changes to a more standard rock song structure, with a chorus of "Got to be free to say what I want/Make what I want and play what I want" (with minor changes as the song progresses, such as "laugh when I want" and "do what I want").<ref name="KK">[http://www.kindakinks.net/discography/showsong.php?song=131 Lyrics to "Got To Be Free"]. Kindakinks.net, Retrieved 1 December 2009</ref><ref name="paper"/> The song was featured in the [[BBC]] ''[[Play for Today]]'' production ''The Long Distance Piano Player'', which featured Ray Davies in the lead role.<ref name="All Day"/>

==Reception and chart performance==
===America===
The album received generally positive reviews in the US. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine commented that it was "the best Kinks album yet."<ref>''Rolling Stone'', 7 January 1971</ref> In his "Consumer Guide" column, critic [[Robert Christgau]] commented that "Lola" had been an "astounding single," but gave ''Lola Versus Powerman'' a mixed review, saying that "the melodies are still there, but in this context they sound corny rather than plaintive."<ref>Christgau, Robert. [http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=The+Kinks Consumer Guide]</ref> The single "Lola" received positive reviews, and, due to its success, an interview with Ray Davies by Jonathan Cott was featured as a cover story for ''Rolling Stone'' in November 1970.<ref>Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 131</ref>

"Lola" was successful in the US market, charting at #9 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] singles chart, staying on the charts for 14 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596267/lola Rolling Stone|title="Lola"|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="Charts"/><ref name="Allmusic Charts">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T51|title="The Kinks: Charts and Awards"|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref> It also peaked at #7 on the ''[[Record World]]'' charts.<ref name="Charts"/><ref name="Allmusic Charts"/> ''Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One'' reached #35 on ''Billboard'', and on the ''Record World'' charts it peaked at #22, making it their most successful album since the mid-60s.<ref name="Charts"/><ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> 

===Britain===
''Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One'' went virtually unnoticed in the UK and failed to chart. "Lola", however, received much more attention in the press, including a spotlight interview with Ray Davies to promote its release in ''[[New Musical Express]]''.<ref>Hinman, Doug (2004). p. 139</ref> The single topped the ''New Musical Express'' charts in the UK, and reached #2 on ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="Charts"/> "Lola" became The Kinks' biggest success since "[[Sunny Afternoon]]" in [[1966 in music|1966]]; the group would never again have another single reach this position in the UK.<ref name="Charts"/>

===Aftermath===
The success of the singles and album allowed The Kinks to negotiate a new contract with [[RCA Records]], construct their own London Studio, which they named "[[Konk (recording)|Konk]]", and assume more creative and managerial control.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/> It helped them regain a footing in the U.S. concert market after the American Federation of Musicians, who had refused permits for the group to perform concerts there since 1965, relented in 1969.<ref name="Who Let"/>

==Soundtrack appearances==
Songs from the album have been featured in multiple films, across several languages. One of the most notable uses of songs from the album was when "This Time Tomorrow", "Strangers", and "Powerman" were used in the 2007 [[Wes Anderson]] film ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]''.<ref name="IMDB Darjeeling">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838221/soundtrack Soundtrack listing] on IMDB, the Internet Movie Database.
