'''Clive Campbell''' (born April 16, 1955), also known as '''Kool Herc''', '''DJ Kool Herc''' and '''Kool DJ Herc''', is a [[Jamaican]]-born [[DJ]] who is credited as originating [[hip hop music]], in [[the Bronx]], New York City.  His playing of [[funk|hard funk]] records of the sort typified by [[James Brown]] was an alternative both to the violent gang culture of the Bronx and to the nascent popularity of [[disco]] in the 1970s.  In response to the reactions of his dancers, Campbell in 1972 began to isolate the instrumental portion of the record which emphasized the drum beat<U+2014>the "[[break (music)|break]]"<U+2014>and switch from one break to another to yet another.

Using the two turntable set-up of the disco DJs, Campbell's style led to the use of two copies of the same record to elongate the break. This [[breakbeat]] DJing, using hard funk, rock, and records with Latin percussion, formed the basis of hip hop music. Campbell's announcements and exhortations to dancers helped lead to the syncopated, rhymed spoken accompaniment we now know as [[rapping]].  He called his dancers break-boys and break-girls,  or simply [[breakdance|b-boys]] and b-girls. Campbell's DJ style was quickly taken up by figures such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]]. Unlike them, he never made the move into commercially recorded hip hop  in its earliest years.

==1520 Sedgwick Avenue==
Clive Campbell was the first of six children born to Keith and Nettie Campbell in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. While growing up, he saw and heard the [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]] of neighborhood parties called [[dancehalls]], and the accompanying speech of their DJs, known as [[toasting]]. He moved to the [[Bronx, New York]] in November 1967.<ref>Chang, pp. 68<U+2013>72</ref> The creation of the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] by [[Robert Moses]] (completed 1963, with further construction continuing through to 1972) had uprooted thousands in the Bronx, displaced communities, and led to "white flight" due to lowered property values in its wake.<ref>Shapiro, p. iv</ref> Many landlords resorted to arson in order to recoup money through insurance policies.  A violent new street gang youth culture emerged there around 1968, and had spread with increasing lawlessness across large parts of the Bronx by 1973.<ref>Chang, pp. 48<U+2013>65. Chang suggests a connection with the rise of the gangs to the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Bobby Hutton]], and to the decline of the [[Black Panther]] party in the face of [[COINTELPRO]] activities among other factors.</ref>

Campbell attended the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor on the basketball court prompted the other kids to nickname him "[[Hercules]]". He began running with a [[Graffiti#Graffiti as an element of hip hop|graffiti]] crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc.<ref name=shapiro>Shapiro, pp. 212<U+2013>213</ref> Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of "[[Sex Machine (song)|Sex Machine]]" by James Brown, a record that not a lot of people had, and one which they would come to him to hear.<ref>Ogg, p. 13</ref>  He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the recreation room of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.<ref name=LAT>Roug, Louise. [http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/24/nation/na-bronx24 "Hip-hop may save Bronx homes"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 24, 2008. Link retrieved September 9, 2008.</ref> Herc's first soundsystem consisted of two turntables and a guitar [[amplifier]], on which he played records like [[James Brown]]'s "[[Give It Up Or Turnit  A Loose]]", [[The Jimmy Castor Bunch]]'s "It's Just Begun" and [[Booker T & the MG's]]'s "Melting Pot".<ref name=shapiro/> With Bronx clubs afflicted with the menacing presence of street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations,  and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from kids in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.<ref name=shapiro/><ref>Ogg, p. 14, p. 18.</ref><ref>Toop, p. 65</ref>

==The break==
At these parties in the recreaton room at Sedgewick Avenue, DJ Kool Herc developed the style that was the blueprint for hip hop music. Herc used two copies of the same record to focus on a short, heavily percussive, part in it: the "break". Since this part of the record was the one the dancers liked best, Herc isolated and prolonged it. As one record reached the end of the break, he cued the other record back to the beginning of the break, thereby extending a relatively small part of a record into a "five-minute loop of fury".<ref>Chang, p. 79</ref>  This innovation had its roots in what he called "The Merry-Go-Round"<U+2014>a switching from break to break done at the height of the party. Herc told ''[[The New York Times]]'' he first introduced the Merry-Go-Round into his sets in 1972.<ref name=hermes>Hermes, Will. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/arts/music/29herm.html "All Rise for the National Anthem of Hip-Hop"], ''New York Times'', October 29, 2006.  Retrieved on September 9, 2008.</ref> The earliest known Merry-Go-Round involved playing James Brown's "Give It Up or Turnit A Loose" (with its [[refrain]],  "Now clap your hands! Stomp your feet!"), then switching from its break into the break from "Bongo Rock" by [[The Incredible Bongo Band]], and from "Bongo Rock"'s break into that of "[[The Mexican (song)|The Mexican]]" by the English rock band [[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]].<ref>Ogg, pp. 14<U+2013>15.</ref> Kool Herc also contributed to developing the rhyming style of hip hop by punctuating the music with slang phrases from the DJ's [[microphone]]: "Rock on, my mellow!" "B-boys, b-girls, are you ready?" "This is the joint!" "To the beat, y'all!" "You don't stop!"<ref name=Hager>Hager, in Cepeda, p. 12<U+2013>26. Cepeda writes that this article was the first appearance of the term hip hop in print, and credits Bambaataa with its coinage (p. 3).</ref><ref>Toop, p. 69</ref>  For his contributions Herc is called a "founding father of hip hop,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,55635,00.html|title='Hip-Hop Nation' Is Exhibit A for America's Latest Cultural Revolution|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2000-09-22|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Karon, Tony}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992268,00.html|title=Rock's New Spin|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=1999-10-18|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Farley, Christopher John}}</ref> a "nascent cultural hero,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1202914,00.html|title=5 Fine Books You Missed (We Did)|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2006-06-11|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> and an integral part of the beginnings of hip hop by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000281,00.html|title=DJ Craze|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2001-07-09|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Farley, Christopher John}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,457885,00.html|title=Dancehall Days|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2003-06-11|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

==B-boys and b-girls==
The "b-boys" and "b-girls" were the dancers to Herc's breaks, who were said by him to be "breaking". Herc has said that "breaking" was contemporary street slang having the meaning "getting excited", "acting energetically" or "causing a disturbance".<ref>Kool Herc, in Israel (director), ''The Freshest Kids'', QD3, 2002.</ref> Herc's terms "b-boy", "b-girl" and "breaking" became part of the lexicon of hip hop culture even before that culture itself had a name. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator [[Grandmixer DXT|Grandmixer D.ST]] describes the early evolution thus: " ... [E]verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to try to come up with something better."<ref name=Hager/> This was the form the media in the early eighties called "[[breakdance]]"; the same form the dance critic of the ''New York Times'' in 1991 declared  "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz."<ref>Dunning, Jennifer. "Nurturing Onstage the Moves Born on the Ghettos' Streets", ''New York Times'', November 26, 1991.</ref> Since the overall emerging culture was yet to be named, its followers were likely to identify as "b-boys" over and above the specific connection to dance, a usage that persisted in following years.<ref>See for example Suggah B in Cross, p. 303: "''I'm a B-girl till I die, when they bury me they're gonna bury me with some [[Adidas Superstar|shelltoes]] on my feet and some gold around my neck because that is how I feel.''"</ref>

==Move to the streets==
With the mystique of his graffiti name, his physical stature, and the reputation of his small parties, Herc had become somewhat of a folk hero in the Bronx. Herc began to play at the nearby Twilight Zone club,<ref name=LAT/> the Havelo club, the Executive Playhouse club, the [[Police Athletic League|PAL]] on 183rd Street,<ref name=shapiro/> and high schools such as Dodge High School and [[William Howard Taft High School (New York City)|Taft High School]].<ref>Ogg, p. 14, p. 17.</ref> Rapping duties were delegated to [[Coke La Rock]]. Herc's collective, known as The Herculords,  was further augmented by Clark Kent and dancers The Nigger Twins.<ref name=shapiro/> Herc also took his soundsystem<U+2014>now upgraded to one of legendary volume<ref>Toop, p. 18<U+2013>19 ''et al''</ref><U+2014>to the streets and parks of the Bronx. [[Nelson George]] recalls a schoolyard party: <blockquote>The sun hadn't gone down yet, and kids were just hanging out, waiting for something to happen. Van pulls up, a bunch of guys come out with a table, crates of records. They unscrew the base of the light pole, take their equipment, attach it to that, get the electricity <U+2013> Boom! We got a concert right here in the schoolyard and it's this guy Kool Herc. And he's just standing with the turntable, and the guys were studying his hands. There are people dancing, but there's as many people standing, just watching what he's doing. That was my first introduction to in-the-street, hip hop DJing.<ref>Ogg, p. 17</ref></blockquote>

==Influence==
A young [[Grandmaster Flash]], to whom Kool Herc was, in his words, "a hero", began DJing in Herc's style in 1975.  By 1976, it was possible for Flash, and his [[MC]]s The Furious Five, to play to a packed [[Audubon Ballroom]] in [[Manhattan]]. Venue owners were often nervous of unruly young crowds, however, and soon sent hip hop back to the clubs, community centers and high school gymnasiums of the Bronx.<ref>Toop, pp. 74<U+2013>76.</ref> [[Afrika Bambaataa]] first heard Kool Herc in 1973. Bambaataa, at that time a general in the notorious Black Spades gang of the Bronx, obtained his own soundsystem in 1975 and began to DJ in Herc's style, converting his followers to the non-violent [[Zulu Nation]] in the process. Kool Herc began using [[The Incredible Bongo Band]]'s "[[Apache (song)|Apache]]" as a break in 1975. It became a firm b-boy favorite<U+2014>"the  Bronx national anthem"<ref name=Hager/><U+2014>and is still in use in hip hop today.<ref name=hermes/> [[Steven Hager]] wrote of this period: <blockquote>For over five years the Bronx had lived in constant terror of street gangs. Suddenly, in 1975, they disappeared almost as quickly as they had arrived. This happened because something better came along to replace the gangs. That something was eventually called hip-hop.<ref name=Hager/></blockquote>

In 1979, record company executive [[Sylvia Robinson]] assembled a group she called [[The Sugarhill Gang]] and recorded "[[Rapper's Delight]]". The hit song ushered in the era of commercially released hip hop. By that year's end, Grandmaster Flash was recording for [[Enjoy Records]]. In 1980, Afrika Bambaataa began recording for [[Winley Records|Winley]]. By this time, DJ Kool Herc's star had faded. Grandmaster Flash suggests that Herc may not have kept pace with developments in techniques of cueing (lining up a record to play at a certain place on it).<ref>Toop, p. 62.</ref>  There were also developments in cutting (switching from one record to another) and scratching (moving the record by hand to and fro under the stylus for percussive effect) in the late seventies. Herc himself explains his retreat from the scene by reference to two events: an incident at the Executive Playhouse where he was stabbed while attempting to intercede in a fight, which took him out of action, and which he suggests made people wary of attending events hosted by him subsequent to it; and the burning down of one of the venues at which he used to DJ. In 1980, Herc had stopped DJing, and was working in a record shop in South Bronx.<ref name=Hager/> 

==Later years==
Kool Herc appeared in Hollywood's take on hip hop, ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984), as himself. Some time  in the mid-1980s, his father passed away, and he became addicted to [[crack cocaine]]. "I couldn<U+2019>t cope, so I started medicating", he says of this period.<ref>Gonzales, Michael A. [http://nymag.com/anniversary/40th/50665/ "The Holy House of Hip-hop: How the Rec Room Where Hip-hop Was Born Became a Battleground For Affordable Housing"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', October 6, 2008.</ref> In 1994 he appeared on [[Terminator X (DJ)|Terminator X]] & the Godfathers of Threatt's album, '' Super Bad''.<ref name=shapiro/> In 2005, he wrote the foreword to [[Jeff Chang]]'s book on hip hop, ''[[Can't Stop, Won't Stop|Can't Stop Won't Stop]]''. In 2006, he became involved in getting Hip Hop commemorated at [[Smithisonian Institution]] museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/arts/music/01hip.html|title=Smithsonian's Doors Open to a Hip-Hop Beat|accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2006-03-01|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Sisario, Ben}}</ref>

Since 2007 he has become involved in a campaign to prevent 1520 Sedgwick Avenue being sold to developers and moved out of its [[Mitchell-Lama]] affordable housing scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/21/nyregion/21citywide.html|title=Will Gentrification Spoil the Birthplace of Hip-Hop? |accessdate=2009-01-01|date=2007-05-21|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gonzalez, David}}</ref> In the Summer of 2007, New York state officials declared 1520 Sedgwick Avenue the "birthplace of hip-hop", and made it eligible for national and state registers.<ref name=LAT/> The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development ruled against the proposed sale in February 2008, on the grounds that "the proposed purchase price is inconsistent with the use of property as a Mitchell-Lama affordable housing development". It is the first time they have so ruled in such a case.<ref>Lee, Jennifer 8.
