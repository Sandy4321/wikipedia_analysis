The '''speaker of the Parliament of Singapore''' is the head officer in the [[Parliament of Singapore]].

The role of speaker is similar to most Commonwealth bodies. The speaker presides over the Parliament and enforces the rules in the Standing Orders of Parliament to allow for the orderly conduct of parliamentary business. As an elected member of Parliament, the Speaker must remain impartial.
