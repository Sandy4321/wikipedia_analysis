'''Suzanne Rachel Flore Lenglen''' ([[24 May]] [[1899]] &ndash; [[4 July]], [[1938]]) was a [[France|French]] [[tennis]] player who achieved much success in the French and [[United Kingdom|British]] women's game from 1919 to 1926, winning 31 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] titles. A flamboyant, trendsetting athlete, she was the first female tennis celebrity and one of the first international female sport stars, named ''La Divine'' (the divine one) by the French press.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clerici|first=Gianni|year=1984|pages=253|title=Suzanne Lenglen &ndash; La Diva du Tennis}}</ref>

== Early life ==

A daughter of Charles Lenglen and his wife, Ana<U+00EF>s, Suzanne Lenglen was born in [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]] (in the department of the [[Oise]]), some 70 [[kilometre|km]] north of [[Paris]]. During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic [[asthma]], which also plagued her at a later age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/lenglensuzanne.shtml|title=Short biography|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, the owner of a carriage company, decided that it would be good for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in [[Marest-sur-Matz]]. The young girl enjoyed the game, and her father decided to train her further in the sport. His training methods included an exercise where he would lay down a handkerchief at various places on the court, to which his daughter had to direct the ball.

Only four years after her first tennis strokes, Lenglen played in the final of the [[1914 in sports|1914]] French Championships. (The tournament,  was only open to members of French clubs until 1925.) She lost to reigning champion [[Marguerite Broquedis]] in a closely fought three-set match: 5&ndash;7, 6&ndash;4, 6&ndash;3. That same year, she won the World Hard Court Championships held at [[Sainte-Claude]], turning 15 during the tournament. The outbreak of [[World War I]] at the end of the year stopped most national and international tennis competitions, and Lenglen's burgeoning career was put on hold.

== Dominance ==

The French championships were not held again until [[1920 in sports|1920]], but the [[Wimbledon Championships]] were again organised after a four year hiatus. Lenglen entered the tournament &mdash; her first on [[grass court|grass]] &mdash; and met seven time winner [[Dorothea Douglass|Dorothea Douglass Chambers]] in the final. The close match, later noted to be one of the hallmarks in tennis history, saw Lenglen saving two match points and winning in 10&ndash;8, 4&ndash;6, 9&ndash;7 to take her first Grand Slam victory. 

Not only her performances on the court were noted, however. She garnered much attention in the media when she appeared at the Wimbledon with her dress revealing bare forearms and cut just above the calf, while all other players competed in outfits covering nearly all of the body. Staid Brits also were in shock at the boldness of the French woman who also casually sipped [[brandy]] between sets. 

At the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]] ([[Belgium]]), Lenglen dominated the women's singles. On her path to the gold medal, she gave up only four games, three of them in the final against [[Dorothy Holman]] of Britain. She then teamed up with [[Max D<U+00E9>cugis]] to win another gold medal in the mixed doubles. She was eliminated in a women's doubles semifinal (playing with [[Elisabeth d'Ayen]]) and won the bronze medal after their opponents withdrew.

From 1919 through 1925, Suzanne Lenglen won the Wimbledon singles championship every year with the exception of 1924.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?par_i_id=53204|title=The First Tennis Celebrity at Olympic.org|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>  Health problems due to her asthma forced her to withdraw after winning her quarterfinal match.  Lenglen was the last French woman to win the Wimbledon ladies singles title until [[Amelie Mauresmo]] in 2006.  

From 1920 through 1926, she won the French Championships five times (three of which were at the World Hard Court Championships).

== Failed American debut ==

Lenglen's only tournament defeat, other than a pre-match withdrawal, in a singles match during this period occurred in an unscheduled appearance in the 1921 [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U..S Championships]].  That year, to raise reconstruction funds for the regions of France that had been devastated by the battles of World War I, she went to the [[United States]] to play several exhibition matches against the [[Norway|Norwegian-born]] US champion, [[Molla Bjurstedt|Molla Bjurstedt Mallory]]. 

Arriving in [[New York City]], Lenglen learned that, without her permission, tournament officials had announced that she would be competing in the US Championships.  Because of immense public pressure, she agreed to play in the tournament despite being run down and suffering from what later was diagnosed by doctors as [[pertussis|whooping cough]]. To her surprise, there was no seeding for the event and her name had been drawn to play against Mallory, the reigning champion. 

In their match, Lenglen lost the first set 6&ndash;2 and just as the second set got underway, she began coughing and burst into tears, unable to continue. The crowd jeered her as she walked off the court and the American press severely criticised her. This worsened when, under doctor's orders after it was confirmed that she was afflicted with whooping cough, she cancelled her exhibition match. Unaccustomed to such treatment, a devastated Lenglen went home.

Once healthy, she set about preparing herself for redemption. In the singles final at Wimbledon the following year, she defeated Mallory in only 26 minutes, winning 6&ndash;2, 6&ndash;0. The two met again later that year at a tournament in [[Nice, France|Nice]] where Mallory failed to win even one game.

== Final amateur year ==

In what would turn out to become her last year as an amateur player, Lenglen played what many consider to be her most memorable match. In a February [[1926 in sports|1926]] tournament at the Carlton Club in [[Cannes]], she played her only match against [[Helen Wills Moody|Helen Wills]]. The 20-year-old American was already a two-time U.S. Open winner and would dominate the women's game in the late 1920s and early 1930s in the same way that Lenglen had dominated it since 1919. 

Public attention for their meeting in the tournament final was immense, and scalper ticket prices went through the roof. Roofs and windows of nearby buildings were also crowded with spectators. The match itself saw Lenglen clinging on to a 6&ndash;3, 8&ndash;6 victory after being close to a collapse on several occasions.

Later in the year, Lenglen seemed to be on course for her seventh Wimbledon singles title. However, Lenglen unknowingly kept [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] waiting in the Royal Box for her appearance in a preliminary match. Lenglen, who had been told that her match would not start until much later, fainted upon being informed of her error, which was seen by [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] English attendees as an insult to the monarchy. Lenglen withdrew from the tournament, which would be her last appearance at the courts of Wimbledon.

== Professional career and later life ==

The first major female tennis star to turn professional, Lenglen was paid U.S. $75,000 to tour the United States in a series of matches against [[Mary K. Browne]]. Browne, winner of the U.S. Championships from 1912 to 1914, was 35 and considered to be past her prime, although she had reached the French final earlier that year (losing to Lenglen 6&ndash;1, 6&ndash;0). 

For the first time in tennis history, the women's match was the headline event of the tour (which also featured male players). In their first match in New York City, Lenglen put on a performance that ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' writer Allison Danzig lauded as "one of the most masterly exhibitions of court generalship that has been seen in this country." When the tour ended in February of 1927, Lenglen had defeated Browne, 38 matches to 0. She was exhausted from the lengthy tour, and a physician advised Lenglen that she needed a lengthy period away from the game to recover. 

Instead, Lenglen chose to retire from competitive tennis to run a Paris tennis school, which she set up with the help and money of her lover [[Jean Tillier]]. The school, located next to the courts of [[Roland Garros]], slowly expanded and was recognised as a federal training centre by the French tennis federation in 1936. During this period, Lenglen also wrote several books on tennis.

In June 1938, the French press announced that Lenglen had been diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Only three weeks later, she went blind. She died of [[pernicious anemia]] on July 4, 1938. She is buried in the [[Cimeti<U+00E8>re de Saint-Ouen]] at [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Ouen]] near Paris.

== Achievements ==

During her career, Lenglen won 81 singles titles, seven of which were achieved without losing a single game. In addition, she won 73 doubles titles and 11 mixed doubles titles. She won the Wimbledon singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles championships in the same year on three separate occasions (1920, 1922, and 1925). <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/suzanne_lenglen.html|title=Wimbledon.org|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>
 
The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), the official clay court world championships, were held in Paris (except for one year in Brussells) beginning in 1912 and lasting through 1923.  Unlike the pre-1925 French Championships, the WHCC was open to all nationalities.  Therefore, the WHCC is the truer forerunner of the open-to-all-nationalities French Championships that began in 1925.  For purposes of determining the total number of Grand Slam titles won by Lenglen, the WHCC is used for 1914 and 1920 through 1923 instead of the closed-to-foreigners French Championships for those years.  Under this counting method, Lenglen's total number of Grand Slam wins is 31.

NH = tournament not held.

A = did not participate in the tournament.

SR = the ratio of the number of Grand Slam singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played.

<sup>1</sup>Through 1923, the French Championships were open only to French nationals.  The World Hard Court Championships (WHCC), actually played on clay in Paris or Brussells, began in 1912 and were open to all nationalities.  The results from that tournament are shown here for 1914 and from 1920 through 1923.  The Olympics replaced the WHCC in 1924, as the Olympics were held in Paris.  Beginning in 1925, the French Championships were open to all nationalities, with the results shown here beginning with that year.

== Legacy ==

[[Image:SuzanneLenglen.jpg|thumb|right|Despite her flamboyant and sometimes controversial appearance on the court, Suzanne Lenglen was also known as a very graceful player.]]

Prior to Lenglen, female tennis matches drew little fan interest, which quickly changed as she became her sport's greatest drawing card. Tennis devotees and new fans to the game began lining up in droves to buy tickets to her matches. Temperamental, flamboyant, she was a passionate player whose intensity on court could lead to an unabashed display of tears.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.style.com/beauty/icon/043003/|title=Beauty icon|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> But for all her flamboyance, she was a gifted and brilliant player who used extremely agile footwork, speed and a deadly accurate shot to dominate female tennis for seven straight years. Her excellent play and introduction of glamour to the tennis court increased the interest in women's tennis, and women's sport in general.

In 1997 the second court at the Roland Garros Stadium, site of the [[French Open]], was renamed ''Court Suzanne Lenglen'' in her honour. Four years later, the French Tennis Federation organised the first ''Suzanne Lenglen Cup'' for women in the over 35 age class. First played in France, the annual event is now held in a different country each year. 

Lenglen, who was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[1978 in sports|1978]], continues to be held by many as one of the best players in tennis history. For example, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, organiser of the Wimbledon Championships, ranks her among the five greatest Wimbledon champions.
