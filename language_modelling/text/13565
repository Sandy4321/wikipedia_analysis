==Markets==
Wes Lematta of [[Columbia Helicopters]] and Jack Erickson were able to demonstrate the first financially successful run of helicopter logging in 1971 using Lematta's S-61 Sikorsky, registration number N318Y and timber provided by the Erickson Lumber Company. The following year the [[Boeing Vertol 107]] was used. Since Lemmata provided the helicopter and Erickson had purchased the timber, both Columbia Helicopters and Erikson Air-Crane claim to be the first successful "Heli-Loggers".

S-64 Aircranes have been sold to the [[Italy|Italian]] [[State Forestry Corps]], and [[Korea Forest Service]] for fire suppression and emergency response duties. Those in the Erickson Air-Crane fleet are leased worldwide to organizations, companies, municipalities and Federal Agencies for either short-term or longer term use in fire suppression, civil protection, heavy lift construction, and [[logging|timber harvesting]]. The aerial services portion of company accounts for 92% of revenues.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Suzanne|title=Erickson Air-Crane lands $44M NATO contract|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/morning_call/2012/05/erickson-air-crane-lands-44m-nato.html|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>
