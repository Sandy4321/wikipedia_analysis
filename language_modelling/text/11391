==Career==
Jenkins began her career with a short film, 1991's ''Fugitive Love'', which screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].  Afterwards she completed a congressional mandate associated with [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] to bring diverse programming to public television, that was funded by the Independent Television Service.<ref name="club90210"/>  Another black and white short film, 1993's ''Family Remains'', followed, which earned her early acclaim; it received a Special Jury Prize for Excellence in Short Filmmaking at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival.<ref name="fox">{{cite web |url= http://content.foxsearchlight.com/studio/node/2399 |title= Tamera Jenkins at Fox Searchlight |accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref>

Her debut feature film, 1998's semi autobiographical ''[[Slums of Beverly Hills]]'' which she both wrote and directed, played at both Sundance and the [[Cannes film festival]].<ref name="mm">{{cite news | last =Fear | first =David | title =Tamara Jenkins Gets Savage | publisher =Movie Maker | date =2008-02-01 | url =http://www.moviemaker.com/screenwriting/article/tamara_jenkins_the_savages_oscar_20080131/ | accessdate =2008-02-05 }}</ref>  Based on her own experience growing up in [[Beverly Hills]] in the 70<U+2019>s, ''Slums'' is a dark comedy about growing up broke in glitzy [[Los Angeles]]. Using photographs Jenkins had kept from her time at [[Beverly Hills High School]], Art Director Scott Plauch and Production Designer Dena Roth were able create an accurate period depiction of Beverly Hills, while also staying true to the autobiographical element key the film<U+2019>s success.<ref>LUCIE, YOUNG. "CURRENTS: MOVIE DECOR; The 70's in Beverly Hills, A Look That Will Not Die." New York Times 13 Aug. 1998: 3.</ref> Starring [[Alan Arkin]], [[Natasha Lyonne]] and [[Marisa Tomei]], the film was nominated for two [[Independent Spirit Awards]] (Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay) and has since become a cult hit. Jenkins took a nearly decade-long hiatus to complete her next feature film.<ref name="avclub"/>  In the nine-year gap between her two films, she worked on an eventually abandoned screenplay about photographer [[Diane Arbus]].<ref name="savages"/> Before returning to her next feature film, Jenkins branched out to explore theater, essay publications, and non-profit film and TV work. In 2003, Tamara directed [[The New Group]]<U+2019>s theater production of A Likely Story, written and performed by [[David Cale]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/89850-The-New-Group-naked-Launches-With-David-Cales-A-Likely-Story-Dec-1 | last =Hernandez | first =Ernio |title=The New Group (naked) Launches With David Cale's A Likely Story, Dec. 1 |accessdate=2012-05-05 }}</ref>

Shortly after her marriage, Jenkins went to [[Yaddo]], the artists' colony in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], to work on her next screenplay that would eventually become 2007's ''[[The Savages (film)|The Savages]]''.<ref name="mm"/>  For this tragicomedy about a [[dysfunctional family]] dealing with the aftershocks of its patriarch's elderly dementia, Jenkins took inspiration from her experiences with her grandmother and father, both of whom were in nursing homes with [[dementia]].<ref name="exclusive">{{cite web |url=http://www.reelzchannel.com/article/463/exclusive-interview-with-tamara-jenkins |title=Exclusive interview with Tamara Jenkins |accessdate=2008-02-05 }}</ref>  Jenkins' father, who was much older than her mother, first needed care when his daughter was in her 30s.<ref name="cbc">{{cite news | last =Onstad | first =Katrina | title =Family matters: Director Tamara Jenkins discusses her film The Savages | publisher =CBC News | date =2007-12-07 | url =http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/savages.html | accessdate =2008-02-05 }}</ref> Additionally, Jenkins built upon her theater work at The New Group, departing from her previously straight dramas to something far more absurd. The film layers a bright, doll-like color palette upon a bleak and often morbid story, relying on the savage wit of her screenplay to tie the film together.<ref>Schwartz, Missy. "Tamara Jenkins." Entertainment Weekly 966/967 (2007): 114. Academic Search Complete. Web. 9 May 2012.</ref>

The project was initially with [[Focus Features]], which had given Jenkins a "blind deal" to write any script she wanted, but agreed to let her develop it elsewhere after what she characterized as a disagreement over casting.  [[Fox Searchlight]] picked up the film with a modest budget ($8 million) and compressed shooting schedule of 30 days.  Starring [[Laura Linney]] (who received her third [[Academy Award]] nomination for her role) and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]], the film became a critical success after screening at numerous film festivals, including Sundance and the [[Toronto Film Festival]].  Jenkins was nominated for an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].

==Personal life==
In addition to her work in film, Jenkins' writing has been published in ''Zoetrope: All-Story'' and ''[[Tin House Magazine]]''.  Most recently her essay, "Holy Innocents", appeared in the book ''Lisa Yuskavage: Small Paintings 1993-2004''.  She has also directed theater at The New Group, worked with teens creating a sex education film for the non-profit organization Scenarios and directed a series of public service announcements for [[Amnesty International]].<ref name="fox"/>
