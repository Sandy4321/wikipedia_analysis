:''For the [[genus]] of [[grass skipper]] [[butterflies]], see [[Eetion (butterfly)]]''.  

In [[Greek mythology]], '''E<U+00EB>tion''' was the father of [[Andromache]], wife of [[Hector]], and of seven sons, including [[Podes]]. He was also the King of [[Thebe, Cilicia|Thebe]] in [[Cilicia]].  In Book 6 of the ''[[Iliad]]'', Andromache claims that [[Achilles]] killed E<U+00EB>tion and all seven of his sons in a raid on Thebe, but in Book 17, Podes is killed by [[Menelaus]]. This inconsistency on [[Homer]]'s part may be an implication that some traditions gave E<U+00EB>tion eight sons.  His wife is never named, but Andromache claims that she was captured in the same raid in which E<U+00EB>tion was killed, and died of sickness in Troy following her release.

Another '''E<U+00EB>tion''', also mentioned in the ''Iliad'', ruled over the island of [[Imbros]].

Yet another '''E<U+00EB>tion''' was the father of [[Cypselus]], the first tyrant of Corinth.
