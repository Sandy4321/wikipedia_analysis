"'''Como Duele'''"  (English: ''How Much It Hurts'') is a [[latin pop]] song by [[Guatemala]]n recording artist [[Ricardo Arjona]], released on 4 November 2008 as the [[lead single]] from his eleventh [[studio album]], ''[[5to Piso]]'' (2008). The song was written and produced by Arjona along with longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Lee Levin under their stage name Los Gringos, with additional production work and background vocals from [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Tommy Torres]]. "Como Duele" is the first single Arjona releases after signing a record deal with [[Warner Music]] in 2008, after being signed to [[Sony Music]] since 1993.

Lyrically, "Como Duele" was intended to show "the monotony that attacks the couples that have many years together, the lack of passion and regreted love that seems to pose over them."<ref name=estereo/> The song became an commercial success for Arjona, becoming his first top ten single in the US ''Billboard'' Top Lating Songs since 2005 and, with a peak of No.2, his highest entry on that list since "[[El Problema]]" in 2002. It also became his sixth song to top the Latin Pop Songs chart, as well as reaching the top in Mexico and Venezuela. "Como Duele" was critically praised by media outlets, receiving comparisons to Arjona's previous song "Olvidarte", and being considered as his "biggest hit in years".<ref name="allmusic"/>

An accompanying [[music video]] for "Como Duele" was released in September 2008. It was directed by Ricardo Calder<U+00F3>n and filmed in Mexico City. In the clip, focused on a department which rooms are being moved, Arjona is shown inside a room that goes empty, and everything that gave life to the place is going away until the department is finally demolished. "Como Duele" was included in the set list of Arjona's [[Quinto Piso Tour]] (2009) and [[Metamorfosis World Tour]] (2012).
