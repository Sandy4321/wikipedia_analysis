'''Anfield Cemetery''', or the '''City of Liverpool Cemetery''', is located in [[Anfield, Liverpool|Anfield]], a district of [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England.  It lies to the northeast of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]], and is bounded by Walton Lane ([[A580 road]]) to the west, Priory Road to the south, a railway line to the north, and the gardens of houses on Ince Avenue to the east.  The cemetery grounds are included in the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]] at Grade&nbsp;II*.<ref name=park>{{NHLE |num= 1000993|desc= Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>

==History==

By the middle of the 19th century the burial grounds in town centres had become dangerously overcrowded, and a series of [[Burial Act]]s were passed to regulate their further use.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}  In 1854 [[Liverpool Corporation]] prohibited any further burials in the city centre graveyards.<ref name=park/>  The first cemetery to be built as a result of this was [[Toxteth Park Cemetery]] in 1855<U+2013>56, but this was to serve a district of Liverpool rather than its centre.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=474|ps=}}  In 1860 a competition was held to design a cemetery in Anfield.  Although this was won by Thomas D. Barry, the commission was awarded to William Gay.  However he resigned the following year, the layout of cemetery was designed by [[Edward Kemp]].  Building started in 1861.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}  The cost of the cemetery, including the purchase of the land, was over <U+00A3>150,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|15000|1864|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}  The first burial took place in 1863,<ref name=park/> and the building of the cemetery was completed the following year.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}  The buildings in the cemetery, including the three chapels, and the entrances and entrance lodges. were designed by the Liverpool architects Lucy and Littler.<ref name=park/>  In the southern part of the site a [[Crematory|crematorium]] was built in 1894<U+2013>96.  This was erected by the Liverpool Crematorium company, and designed by James Rhind.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=395|ps=}}{{efn|This was the first crematorium in Liverpool, and only the fourth to be built in England.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=395|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pye|2011|p=199|ps=}}}}  In 1951 a [[columbarium]] was built to the southeast of the crematorium.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=395|ps=}}  Two of the original chapels and one of the lodges have been demolished.<ref name=park/>

==Description==

The site is roughly diamond-shaped, lying on a northwest-southeast axis, and occupying an area of about 57 hectares.  It is bounded mainly by a [[sandstone]] wall, and by a short length of fencing.  There are four entrances, the main entrance being at the corner of Walton Lane and Priory Road.  There are other separate entrances on Walton Lane and on Priory Road, and a fourth entrance at the northeast corner, which is known as the Cherry Lane entrance, and is entered by a bridge under the railway line.  A further, separate, entrance, leads to the crematorium.  Within the cemetery, an east-west axial path runs between the main entrance and the Cherry Lane entrance, which is crossed by a north-south axial path between the other entrances.  At the crossing point is a sunken rectangular area with [[apse|apsidal]] ends.  To the south of this is the remaining chapel,{{efn|The existing chapel was originally the [[Nonconformism|Nonconformist]] Chapel.  The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Chapel stood to the north, and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chapel to the east, of the crossing point.<ref name=park/>}} and to the east are two buildings known as the North and South [[Catacombs]].<ref name=park/>

Associated with the cemetery are twelve buildings that are designated by [[English Heritage]] as Grade&nbsp;II [[listed buildings]].  All are constructed in sandstone.  The main entrance consists of two carriageways with gate [[pier (architecture)|piers]] between and flanking them.  The central gate pier is enlarged to form an octagonal clock tower with [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] features, including a [[gable]]d top and [[pinnacle]]s.  The carriageways contain iron gates.  Flanking the carriageways are pedestrian entrances, above which are iron [[canopy (building)|canopies]].{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1025284|desc= Main entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  There is a lodge to the north and another to the south of the main entrance.  The north lodge is in one storey with an attic.  It has an L-shaped plan with a porch in the angle.  To the right of this is a [[cant (architecture)|canted]] [[bay window]], above which is a window containing the [[coat of arms]] of the city.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1062568|desc= Lodge to north of main entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  The south lodge also has a single storey with an attic, and contains windows with pointed arches and [[transom (architecture)|transoms]].  In the centre is a gabled porch with a pointed arched entrance, above which is a [[dormer]].<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1062569|desc= Lodge to south of main entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  The Cherry Lane entrance incorporates a bridge under the railway.  It has a central carriageway, which is flanked by footways.  Its features include [[battlement|castellated]] [[portal]]s each of which has a [[turret|tourelle]], coats of arms of the city, and fine gates.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|pp=394<U+2013>395|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1280396|desc= Cherry Lane entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  The entrances on Walton Lane and Priory Road are similar to each other.  They consist of four gate piers with [[molding (decorative)|moulded]] bases, which are surmounted by pyramidal [[finial]]s.  Between the piers are ornamental [[wrought iron]] gates.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1062570|desc= Walton Lane entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num= 1365824|desc= Priory Lane entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  To the south of the Priory Road entrance is another lodge, also in a single storey with an attic, which is similar to the lodge to the south of the main entrance.<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1365823|desc= Lodge to south of Priory Road entrance to Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  In Priory Road is the former registrar's office.  This has an irregular plan, and is in two storeys and five bays.  It contains bay windows, the other windows being mullioned and transomed.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1072971|desc= Lansdowne House, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>

Inside the cemetery is the one remaining chapel, which originally served the [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]. This is constructed in stone with a [[slate]] roof, in [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English]] style.  It consists of a [[nave]] with an [[apse]], and north and south [[aisle]]s, each of which ends in a porch.  Above the north porch is a steeple, which contains two-light [[louver|louvred]] bell openings with [[gargoyle]]s and [[pinnacle]]s, and is surmounted by a spire with [[lucarne]]s.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1356295|desc= South Chapel, Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  Flanking the site of the former [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chapel are two entrances to former catacombs.  From these, coffins were carried by hydraulic lifts down to a crypt about {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} beneath the ground.  The crypt contains four passages, which are lined on each side by recesses for the coffins.  Above ground are [[buttress]]ed [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] in nine [[bay (architecture)|bays]] with [[corbel]]led [[parapet]]s and [[gargoyle]]s.{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=394|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pye|2011|p=199|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1068391|desc= South Catacomb, Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num= 1068390|desc= North Catacomb, Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  The entrances to the catacombs are now blocked.<ref name=park/>  The crematorium is in [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] style, and has a T-shaped plan.  Its tower, a disguised chimney, includes [[louver|louvred]] bell openings, gargoyles, and an [[battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]].{{sfnp|Pollard|Pevsner|2006|p=395|ps=}}<ref>{{NHLE |num= 1072972|desc= Crematorium at Anfield Cemetery, Liverpool|accessdate= 31&nbsp;March 2013|separator=,|ps=}}</ref>  Because of the state of the one remaining chapel, now unused, and the poor condition of the catacombs, the site has been placed on the [[Heritage at Risk|Heritage at Risk Register]] of English Heritage.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://risk.english-heritage.org.uk/register.aspx?id=4746&rt=0&pn=1&st=a&ctype=all&crit=Anfield| title = Anfield Cemetery| accessdate = 31&nbsp;March 2013| publisher = English Heritage}}</ref>
