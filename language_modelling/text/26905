"'''How About a Friendly Shrink?'''" is the thirteenth episode of the [[Desperate Housewives (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American comedy-drama series, ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and the 124th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States on January 17, 2010. In the episode, [[Tom Scavo|Tom]] tries to convince [[Lynette Scavo|Lynette]] to seek marriage counseling, [[Gabrielle Solis|Gabrielle]] clashes with [[Susan Mayer|Susan]] about their children's intelligence, and [[Bree Van de Kamp|Bree]] tries to care for an increasingly irritable [[Orson Hodge|Orson]].

The episode was written by Jason Ganzel and directed by [[Lonny Price]]. "How About a Friendly Shrink?" marked the return of [[Katherine Mayfair]], portrayed by [[Dana Delany]], who had been not appeared since the episode "[[Boom Crunch]]". It also featured [[Jane Leeves]], who previously starred as [[Daphne Moon]] on the American [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Frasier]]'', in a guest appearance as Tom and Lynette's therapist, Dr. Graham.

"How About a Friendly Shrink?" received generally mixed reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 11.2 million viewers. It was the lowest rating for an individual ''Desperate Housewives'' in the series' history, a distinction it held only two weeks until the subsequent episode, "[[The Glamorous Life (Desperate Housewives)|The Glamorous Life]]", drew even poorer ratings. The viewership for "How About a Friendly Shrink?" suffered due to competition from the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]] on NBC and the two-hour [[24 (season 8)|eighth season]] premiere of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

==Plot==
When he learns that [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Bob Hunter|Bob]] ([[Tuc Watkins]]) and [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Lee McDermott|Lee]] ([[Kevin Rahm]]) are seeing a counselor, [[Tom Scavo|Tom]] ([[Doug Savant]]) suggests going to one with [[Lynette Scavo|Lynette]] ([[Felicity Huffman]]), but she insists therapy is for "losers". Tom starts seeing a therapist on his own and keeping a "feelings" journal, which he will not let Lynette read. Angrily, she visits the therapist, Dr. Graham ([[Jane Leeves]]), to defend herself from what she's sure is Tom's badmouthing. She admits she gets mad when she is not in control. When Dr. Graham equates this to the lack of control Lynette felt in losing her baby, Lynette reluctantly sits down on the couch. Later, when Tom returns from work, Lynette informs him they will be going to therapy together.

Confined to a wheelchair, [[Orson Hodge|Orson]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]) continues to order [[Bree Van de Kamp|Bree]] ([[Marcia Cross]]) around at his whim and refuses to let her give him a bath. When Orson refuses to say please while Bree brings him breakfast, she places the waffles on a shelf he cannot reach. When the physical therapist arrives, he pretends to be starving and abused. The therapist tells Bree she must be more patient, or she will be reported. Later, when Orson still refuses to be bathed, Bree takes him outside and sprays him with the garden hose until he begs her to stop. He breaks down and admits he is miserable at the prospective of a life in which he needs to ask for help in everything. Bree finally understands, and asks Orson for forgiveness.

The Oakridge students are placed into learning groups named after animals. [[Gabrielle Solis|Gabrielle]] ([[Eva Longoria Parker]]) initially suspects her daughter [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Juanita Solis|Juanita]] ([[Madison De La Garza]]), who is in the Leopards, is among the slow group, whereas [[Susan Mayer|Susan]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) is pleased that her son [[Acquaintances of Susan Mayer#M.J. Delfino|M.J.]] ([[Mason Vale Cotton (actor)|Mason Vale Cotton]]) is in the Giraffes, which she believes are advanced. This leads to competitive behavior between the two ladies. Eventually, by taking pictures of different students' homework and studying them, Gabrielle realizes the Leopards are actually advanced and the Giraffes are slow. When Susan realizes this, she confronts a teacher in public, and the secret code of the animal groups becomes widespread. While Susan and Gabrielle wait to talk to the principal, they both admit they got carried away and confess fears that they are letting their kids down.

[[Angie Bolen|Angie]] ([[Drea de Matteo]]) takes an instant dislike to her son [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Danny Bolen|Danny]]'s ([[Beau Mirchoff]]) new girlfriend, [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Ana Solis|Ana]] ([[Maiara Walsh]]), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels comfortable talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, [[Katherine Mayfair|Katherine]] ([[Dana Delany]]) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. [[Karen McCluskey|Karen]] ([[Kathryn Joosten]]) visits her and asks her to come back to [[Wisteria Lane]], but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive her.

"How About a Friendly Shrink?" received generally mixed reviews. Gerrick Kennedy of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the episode and was particularly excited by the guest appearance by Jane Leeves. She called the subplot between Gaby and Susan was "cute, but honest", but felt the Orson and Katherine characters have "run their course".<ref name="Kennedy" /> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Tanner Stransky declared the reappearance of Katherine Mayfair was the only interesting element of the episode, and that it was touching to see her realize the damage she had done. Stransky wrote, "The rest of the story lines from last night just kind of sat there rather limply," and said the Orson and Bree story, and Tom and Lynette's therapy, "just seemed so dumpy for this once-sexy show".<ref name="EW">{{Cite news |last=Stransky |first=Tanner |title="Desperate Housewives" recap: Therapeutic Effect |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 18, 2010 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20337563,00.html |accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref>

DeAnn Welker of ''[[MSNBC]]'' complimented the Katherine homecoming, and said the best line of the episode was Karen McCluskey's response when Katherine rejected visitors: "Who says I'm visiting? Maybe I'm bonkers too." Welker, however, was critical of the subplot between Gaby and Susan, who she said were "stuck in storylines-that-don<U+2019>t-matter territory."<ref name="Welker">{{Cite news |last=Welker |first=DeAnn |title=Relationship issues abound on "Housewives" |work=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 7, 2010 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34620581/ns/entertainment-television/ |accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref> Glenn Diaz of ''[[BuddyTV]]'' felt the episode did little to advance the overall plot of the series, but included some strong scenes and good jokes.
