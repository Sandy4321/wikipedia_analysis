'''Phish''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band noted for its [[musical improvisation]], extended [[jam session]]s, exploration of music between genres, and dedicated fan base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfchroniclemarketplace.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/10/01/entertainment/e064214D66.DTL|title=No Phish tale: Jamband announces 3 shows |publisher=news.google.com|accessdate=2008-10-01}}</ref>  Formed at the [[University of Vermont]] in 1983, the band's four members performed together for over 20 years until an official breakup in August 2004. The band reunited in 2009 for three shows at the [[Hampton Coliseum]] in {{USCity|Hampton|Virginia}} as well as a full summer tour.

Their music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phish.net/faq/phish.html |title= What Is Phish? |accessdate=2007-03-14 |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net}}</ref> including [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[funk]]. Each of their concerts is original in terms of the songs performed, the order in which they appear, and the way in which they are performed.

Although the band has received little radio play or [[MTV]] exposure, Phish developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, via Phish.net, and the exchange of live recordings: selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.<ref>[http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2009/03/04/tour_bound_phish_asks_judge_to_reel_in_b Starpulse, Phish]</ref><ref>[http://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/article/596459 The Star, Phish]</ref>. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated that the band helped to "...spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and superextended [[groove (music)|groove]]s."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography |title=Phish |accessdate=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |publisher=rollingstone.com}}</ref> 

==History==
===1983-1992===
Phish was formed at [[The University of Vermont]] in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]] and drummer [[Jon Fishman]]. For their first gig, at a [[Halloween]] dance in the basement of the [[ROTC]] dormitory, the band was billed as Blackwood Convention, a reference to a [[Blackwood convention|bidding convention]] in [[contract bridge]]. Their second gig <U+2014> and their first billed as "Phish" <U+2014> was November 3 in the basement of Slade Hall at UVM,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/history.html#first|title=Phishtory: Phirst gig |work=FAQ File|publisher=phish.net|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> though another source gives the date as December 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livephish.com/show.asp?show=311|title=Fleet Center, Boston, MA, December 2, 2003 |publisher=livephish.com|work=Life Phish Download|accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref> The band was joined by [[percussion instrument|percussion]]ist [[Marc Daubert]] in the fall of 1984;<ref>{{Cite book | author=Bernstein, Andy; Celentano, Brian; Chasnoff, Larry; Steele, Lockhart | title=The Pharmers Almanac : The Unofficial Guide to the Band Phish (Volume 1) | publisher=Berkley Publishing Group | isbn=0-425-16356-3 | pages=32}}</ref> he left the band early in 1985,<ref name="college">{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/history.html#college|title=Phishtory: College Years |work=FAQ Files|publisher=phish.net|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> and [[Page McConnell]] joined on [[keyboards]] in September. Holdsworth left the group after graduation in 1986, solidifying the band's lineup of "Trey, Page, Mike, and Fish" <U+2014> the lineup that would remain for the rest of the band's lifespan.<ref name="college" />

Following a prank at UVM with his friend and former bandmate Steve Pollak &mdash; also known as "[[The Dude of Life]]" &mdash; Anastasio decided to leave the college. With the encouragement of McConnell (who received $50 for each transferee), Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to [[Goddard College]], a small school in the hills of [[Plainfield, Vermont|Plainfield]], [[Vermont]].<ref name="college" /> Phish distributed at least six different experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including ''[[Phish (album)|The White Tape]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/discography.html#demos | title= Discography: Early demos |work=FAQ Files|phblisher=phish.net| accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> This first studio recording was [[Phish#Live recording circulation|circulated]] in two variations: the first, mixed in a dorm room as late as 1985, received a higher distribution than the second studio remix of the original four tracks, circa 1987.  The older version was officially released as ''The White Tape'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/whitealbum.html | title= What is the "White Album"? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net | accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

By 1985, the group had encountered [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], [[Vermont]] [[luthier]] [[Paul Languedoc]], who would eventually design two guitars for Anastasio and two basses for Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/languedoc.html | title= Paul Languedoc |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net| accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> Recently, however, Languedoc has begun crafting guitars on custom order and, on a very limited basis, to the general public through local music shops.

As his senior project, Anastasio penned ''[[The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday]]'', a nine-song concept album that would become their second studio experiment.  Recorded between 1987 and 1988, it was submitted in July of that year, accompanied by a written thesis.  Elements of the story <U+2014> known as ''[[Gamehendge]]'' <U+2014> grew to include an additional eight songs.  The band performed the suite in concert on five occasions: in 1988, 1991, 1993, and twice in 1994 without replicating the song list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/tmwsiy.html | title= What is ''The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday''? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net| accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

Beginning in the spring of 1988, the band began practicing in earnest, sometimes locking themselves in a room and jamming for hours on end.  Dubbed "Okipa Ceremonies" (also spelled Oh Kee Pa), one such jam took place at Anastasio's apartment, and a second was at Paul Languedoc's house in August 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/ohkeepa.html | title= What is an Oh Kee Pa (aka Okipa) Ceremony? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> The band attributes the sessions to Anastasio, who discovered the concept in the films ''[[A Man Called Horse]]'' and ''Modern Primitives.''<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gehr, Richard | coauthors= Phish| title=The Phish book | year=1998 | publisher=Villard | location=New York  | isbn=0-375-50203-3 | pages=}}</ref>  The product of one of these sessions was included in the band's first mass-released recording, a double album called ''[[Junta (album)|Junta]]'', later that year.

On January 26, 1989, Phish played the Paradise Rock Club in [[Boston]].  The owners of the club had never heard of Phish and refused to book them, so the band rented the club for the night.  The show sold out due to the caravan of fans that had traveled to see the band.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Morse |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Twenty years later, Phish still moves against the current |url=http://nugs.net/press/bostonglobe_031130.pdf |format=PDF, Reprint |work=The Boston Globe |publisher= |location=Boston, MA |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> 

By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special "secret language,"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phish.net/faq/language.html |title=What is the secret language?  What are "the signals"? |accessdate=2008-05-11 |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net}}</ref> the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band.  For instance, if Anastasio "[[Teasing#Other usage|teased]]" a motif from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' theme song, the audience would yell, "[[D'oh!]]" in imitation of {{Audio|PhishSimpsonsCue002.ogg|Homer Simpson.}}  In 1992, Phish introduced  collaboration between audience and band called the "Big Ball Jam" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit.  In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.

In an experiment known as "The Rotation Jam", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left.  On occasion, a performance of "[[You Enjoy Myself]]" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers on mini-[[trampoline]]s while playing their instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/tramps.html | title= Phish, um... jumps on trampolines??|work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net| accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

Phish, along with [[Bob Dylan]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[The Beatles]], was one of the first bands to have a [[Usenet]] newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991.  Aware of the band's growing popularity, [[Elektra Records]] signed them that year.  The following year ''[[A Picture of Nectar]]'' was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's ''[[Junta (album)|Junta]]'' or 1990s ''[[Lawn Boy]]''.  These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well.

The first annual [[H.O.R.D.E.]] festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters.  The lineup, among others, included Phish, [[Blues Traveler]], [[The Spin Doctors]], and [[Widespread Panic]].  That summer, the band toured Europe with the [[Violent Femmes]] and later toured Europe and the U.S. with [[Carlos Santana]].

[[Image:Halloween 1995.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Poster for Phish's 1995 Halloween extravaganza]]

===1993-1995===
Phish began headlining major amphitheaters in the summer of 1993.  That year, the group released ''[[Rift (album)|Rift]]'' packaged as a [[concept album]] and with heavy promotion from Elektra including artwork by [[David Welker]]. In 1994, the band released ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]].'' To promote the album, the band made their only video for [[MTV]], "[[Down With Disease]]", airing in June of that year. On [[Halloween]] of that year, the group promised to don a fan-selected "[[Phish and their musical costumes|musical costume]]" by playing an entire album from another band.  After an extensive mail-based poll, Phish performed [[The Beatles]]' [[The Beatles (album)|self-titled album]] <U+2014> as the second of their three sets at the [[Glens Falls Civic Center]] in upstate New York. Following the death of [[Grateful Dead]] frontman [[Jerry Garcia]] in the summer of 1995 and the appearance of "Down With Disease" on ''[[Beavis and Butthead]]'', the band experienced a surge in the growth of their fan base and an increased awareness in popular culture.

In their tradition of playing a well-known album by another band for Halloween, Phish contracted a full [[horn section]] for [[Phish and their musical costumes#Musical costume 1995: Phish play The Who|their performance]] of [[The Who|The Who's]] ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' in 1995.  Their first live album <U+2014> ''[[A Live One]]'' <U+2014> which was released during the summer of 1995 became Phish's first [[RIAA]] certified gold album in November 1995.<ref name="RIAA Certifications">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/search_results.asp | title= "List of Phish albums certified as gold or platinum"|publisher=riaa.com | accessdate= 2007-06-14}}</ref>

During this fall tour, the band challenged their audience to two games of [[chess]], with each show of the tour consisting of a pair of moves.  The band made their move during the first set, and, during the break between sets, the audience members could vote on their collective move at the [[Greenpeace]] table.  The audience conceded the first game at the November 15 show in Florida, and the band conceded the second at their [[Phish: New Year's Eve 1995 - Live at Madison Square Garden|New Year's Eve concert]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].  Having played only two games, the score remains tied at 1-1.<ref name="phish.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/chess.html | title= What Does Chess Have to Do with Phish?|work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net | accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> This year-end concert would later be named as one of the greatest concerts of the 1990s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref name="Rolling Stone">{{cite news |first=David |last=Fricke |title=Phish  |url= |publisher=Rolling Stone|page=60 |date=1999-12-30}}</ref>

===1996-2000===
Phish retreated to their Vermont recording studio and recorded hours and hours of improvisations, sometimes overlaying them on one another, and included some of the result on the second half of ''[[Billy Breathes]]'', which they released in the fall of 1996.  Alongside traditional rock-based [[crescendo]]s, the album has more acoustic guitar than their previous records, and was regarded by the band and some fans<ref name="Billy Breathes">{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Paul |title=Trey Anastasio, the brains behind Phish, plays from the heart on Billy Breathes. |url=http://www.phish.net/archives/interviews/1996/199612.html |format=Reprint |work=Guitar World Online |publisher=phish.net |date=December, 1996 |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> as their crowning studio achievement.

That summer, they mounted their first two-day festival <U+2014> [[The Clifford Ball]] <U+2014> at a decommissioned Air Force base in [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], [[New York]].  Between 70,000 and 80,000 people were in attendance; [[MTV]] was on-hand to document the experience.  In Phish's own makeshift city, Great Northeast Productions created an amusement park, restaurants, a post office, playgrounds, arcades, and movie theaters.  Aside from six "traditional" sets, the band rode a flatbed truck through the campground, serenading the audience at 3 a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/clifford.html | title= What was The Clifford Ball? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> The concert's production company went on to host six more Phish festivals.

By 1997 jams were becoming so long that several sets contained only four songs; their improvisational ventures were developing into a new [[funk]]-inspired jamming style.  Vermont-based [[ice cream]] conglomerate [[Ben & Jerry's]] launched "[[Phish Food]]" that year and proceeds from the flavor are donated to the Lake Champlain Initiative.  Part of Phish's new non-profit foundation, [[The WaterWheel Foundation]] was also composed of two other now-defunct branches: The Touring Branch and the Vermont Giving Program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/phood.html | title= What's the story behind Phish Food? |work=FAQ FIles|publisher=phish.net|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

[[The Great Went]], Phish's second large-scale festival, was held that summer at [[Loring Air Force Base]] in [[Limestone, Maine|Limestone]], [[Maine]], just miles from the Canadian border.  The official count for the show was an impressive 65,000 people, qualifying the festival to be the largest city in Maine.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Pollock |title=They Came, They Partied, They Went; 65,000 Phish Fans Flood Maine for Weekend Jam Session |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/13526175.html?dids=13526175:13526175&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&fmac=&date=Aug+18%2C+1997&author=Chris+Pollock&desc=They+Came%2C+They+Partied%2C+They+Went |format= |work=The Washington Post |page=C.01 |date=1997-08-18 |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> For many fans however, the crowd felt larger. Band and audience collaborated yet again in a colossal work of art: individual pieces of art by fans were connected to a large piece of art by the band.  A giant matchstick was lit, burning the resultant tower to the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.com/tmiph/index.php?year=1997&month=8 | title= August 1997|work=This Month in Phish History |publisher=phish.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

[[Image:Lemonwheel .jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Lemonwheel]]]]

Phish returned to Limestone in the summer of 1998 for the [[Lemonwheel]] festival, drawing 60,000 fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godstreetwine.com/mailinglist/finewine/archive/finewine/finewine.log9809a.txt | title=Phish Fest Nets $81,000 In Drugs; 1,200 Arrests|work=SonicNet News |publisher=sonicnet.com|accessdate=2008-06-13|date=1998-09-02}}</ref> Phish headlined [[Farm Aid]] in October, sharing the stage with [[Willie Nelson]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Paul Shaffer]]. Again, altering their approach to studio releases, the band recorded hours of improvisational jams over a period of several days and took the highlights of those jams and wrote songs around them.  The result was ''[[The Story of the Ghost]]'' in October and the instrumental ''[[The Siket Disc]]'' released the following year.  On Halloween in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], the group performed ''[[Loaded (album)|Loaded]]'' by [[The Velvet Underground]]; two nights later they played [[Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd's]] ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' unannounced and in its entirety to an audience of 4,000 in [[Utah]].

In 1999, the band decided to forgo the annual summer festival to prepare for the [[New Year's Eve]] millennium celebration.  However, at the eleventh hour, [[Camp Oswego]] was held in July at the [[Oswego County Airport]] in the upstate New York town of [[Volney, New York|Volney]], with 65,000 in attendance.

For the Millennium Celebration, Phish traveled to the [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]] in the Florida [[Everglades]]. Of the major New Year's Eve concerts around the globe <U+2014> [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Billy Joel]] <U+2014> at 85,000, Phish had the largest attendance of any paid concert event that night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phish.com/bandhistory/index.php?year=1999 | title= 1999|work=Band History|publisher=phish.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> During [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s millennium coverage, [[Peter Jennings]] and ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'' reported on the massive audience and featured the band's performance of "Heavy Things".  Called [[Big Cypress (Phish festival)|"Big Cypress"]], the enormous festival culminated with an extended seven-and-a-half hour set that began at midnight and ended at sunrise.

2000 saw no Halloween show, no summer festival and no new songs: May's ''[[Farmhouse (album)|Farmhouse]]'' contained material dating from 1997.  That summer, the band announced that they would take their first "extended time-out" following their upcoming fall tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/hiatus.html | title= Why did Phish stop playing for how long? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>  During the tour's last concert on October 7, 2000 at the Shoreline Amphitheater in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]], they played a regular show and left without saying a word as [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]'' played over the sound system.

The hiatus allowed the members of Phish to explore more deeply their musical side projects. Anastasio continued the [[Trey Anastasio (band)|solo career]] he'd begun two years earlier, formed the group [[Oysterhead]], and began conducting an orchestral composition with the Vermont Youth Orchestra.  Gordon made an album with acoustic guitar legend [[Leo Kottke]] and two films before launching his own solo career.  Fishman alternated between [[Jazz Mandolin Project]] and his band [[Pork Tornado]], while McConnell formed the trio [[Vida Blue (band)|Vida Blue]].

===2002-2004===
Over two years after the hiatus began, Phish announced that they were getting back on the road with a [[New Year's Eve]] 2002 concert at Madison Square Garden. They also recorded ''[[Round Room]]'' in only three days.  In their return concert, McConnell's brother was introduced as actor [[Tom Hanks]].  The [[ringer]] sang a line of the song "Wilson," prompting several media outlets to report that the actor had "jammed with Phish."

At the end of the 2003 summer tour, Phish held their first summer festival in four years, returning to Limestone for [[It (Phish festival)|It]].  The festival drew crowds of over 60,000 fans, once again making Limestone one of the largest cities in Maine for a weekend.  In December, the band celebrated its 20th anniversary with a 4 show mini-tour culminating at [[Boston]]'s [[TD Banknorth Garden|Fleet Center]]. During the Albany date on this tour, Phish invited founding member Jeff Holdsworth onstage for the first time since 1986.

In order to avoid the exhaustion and pitfalls of previous years' high-paced touring, Phish played sporadically after the reunion, with tours lasting about two weeks.  After an April 2004 run of shows in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Anastasio announced on the band's website that after a small summer tour the band was breaking up.  Their final album, ''[[Undermind]]'', was released in late spring.

The band jammed with rapper [[Jay-Z]] at their second [[Brooklyn]] show in the summer of 2004, and performed a seven-song set atop the marquee of the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] during ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to fans who had gathered on the street, a move reminiscent of [[The Beatles]]' final performance [[Let It Be (film)#The rooftop performance|on the rooftop of the Apple building]] in London.  Their final show was also the last Phish summer festival <U+2014> [[Coventry (Phish festival)|Coventry]] <U+2014> named for the town in Vermont that hosted the event.  100,000 people were expected to attend.

After a week of rain that prompted rumors of a sinking stage, Gordon announced on the local radio station that attendees should turn around, no more cars were being allowed in.  As only about 20,000 people had been admitted, many concert-goers abandoned their vehicles on highway roadsides, shoulders and medians and hiked to the site, some as far as thirty miles.  With the number of people that walked in, the crowd grew to an estimated 65,000 in attendance.

The band broke down crying onstage several times during the final concert, most notably when McConnell choked up during the ballad "Wading in the Velvet Sea" and elicited Anastasio to say a few words of farewell.  Coventry was an emotional goodbye for Phish and for its audience; an end to Phish's chapter in rock music.  With little help from radio, music television channels and album sales, Phish became one of the top ten grossing live acts in North America.<ref>http://www.bsomusic.org/main.taf?p=5,9,1,1&prid=20090521_1&type=event&season=0809</ref>  As ''Rolling Stone'' put it:<ref>{{cite news |first=Hendrickson |last=Matt  |title=Review of 'Lemonwheel' |work=Issue #792 |publisher=Rolling Stone |pages=20-22  |date=1998-10-01}}</ref> 

:{{cquote|Given their sense of community, their ambition and their challenging, generous performances, Phish has become the most important band of the Nineties.}}

===2004-2008===
During their break-up, members of Phish maintained various solo projects.  Anastasio continued his solo career with [[Trey Anastasio (band)|his own band]] and performed with [[Oysterhead]] in June 2006.  Gordon played with [[Leo Kottke]] and the [[Benevento/Russo Duo]]. At [[Bonnaroo]] in 2006, he played with his newest project, [[Ramble Dove]], which is the name of the country outfit he fronted in his directorial feature ''[[Outside Out]]'', and also joined [[Grateful Dead]] drummers [[Mickey Hart]] and [[Bill Kreutzmann]] along with [[Steve Kimock]] and Jen Durkin as the [[Rhythm Devils]].  Anastasio and Gordon toured as a four-piece with the Benevento/Russo Duo in the summer of 2006. McConnell debuted his new solo project at a festival in September 2006 held by jam band [[moe.]] and released his [[Page McConnell (album)|self-titled debut]] on  April 17, 2007. Fishman has performed occasional shows with the Everyone Orchestra, [[The Village]] and the [[Yonder Mountain String Band]], but had, for the most part, retired from the music business.

Phish received the [[Jammys]] Lifetime Achievement Award on May 7, 2008 in [[The Theater at Madison Square Garden]].  Jammys Executive Producer and Co-Creator [[Peter Shapiro]] said, "Few bands have meant as much to the improvisational music community as they have, so celebrating their career is something that is a natural thing for us to do."<ref>{{cite web|title= The Jammy Awards Return to Madison Square Garden; Phish to receive Lifetime Achievement Award; All-Star Concert and Awards Show Being Held: May 7, 2008|url=http://www.jammys.com/newsite/pressrelease.html|accessdate=2008-04-17|work=jammys.com}}</ref>

===2009 reunion===

==Music==
{{main|Music of Phish}}
Phish's musical ethos is a mix of [[improvisation]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[reggae]], [[Latin music|Latin]] ([[Salsa music|salsa]]), [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[progressive rock]], [[acoustic music|acoustic]], and [[European classical music|classical]].  Some of their original compositions (such as "Theme from the Bottom") tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] and bluegrass fusion, with more rock, jazz and funk elements than the [[Grateful Dead]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]] and other earlier jam bands.  Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as "You Enjoy Myself" and "Guyute") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much related to the genre of [[progressive rock]].  All told, the band has performed 620 individual compositions, of which 226 were originals (of [[List of Phish songs|the 244 they penned]]) and 394 [[Cover version|covers]].

===Discography===
{{main|Phish discography}}
In addition to their thirteen studio-recorded albums, Phish has released a multitude of live shows: seven traditional live albums, and a series of 27 complete concerts called ''[[Live Phish Series|Live Phish]]''.  Phish has also released 6 videos, containing live concert footage and documentary material.  The band's ''[[Junta (album)|Junta]]'' and ''[[A Live One]]'' reached platinum status, and the albums ''[[Lawn Boy]]'', ''[[A Picture of Nectar]]'', ''[[Rift (album)|Rift]]'', ''[[Hoist (album)|Hoist]]'', ''[[Billy Breathes]]'', ''[[Slip Stitch and Pass]]'', ''[[Hampton Comes Alive]]'', and ''[[Farmhouse (album)|Farmhouse]]'' reached gold status.  In addition, their DVD ''[[Phish: Live in Vegas]]'' achieved gold status, and the DVD of ''[[It (video)|It]]'' went platinum.

==Concerts and fan culture==
The driving force behind Phish is the popularity of their concerts and the fan culture surrounding the event.  Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics.  With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with "Shakedown Street": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run like an antelope: on the road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York  | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | pages=95}}</ref>  For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country.

===''Tickets by Mail''===  	 
Fans were able to purchase tickets before the general public by using [[Phish Tickets By Mail]], a mail-order service available through Phish.com or their newsletter, ''Doniac Schvice''. The service was first made available for [[Taper (concert)|tapers']] tickets prior to the 1993 new years run and became available for both tapers' and regular tickets by Summer 1995.  Orders were filled on a first-come-first-served basis, making every attempt to return all orders before tickets went on sale through traditional outlets. All levels of seating were made available through [[Phish Tickets By Mail]] (including the best seats in the house).  Starting with the 1995 new years run, mail order tickets featured unique designs by long-time band artist Jim Pollock.  In 2002, Phish abandoned the mail-in method of Tickets-By-Mail in favor of an Internet-based ticketing system, allowing ticket-seekers to submit all necessary information online. Abandoning the first-come-first-served philosophy, orders were instead filled by lottery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/mailorder.html | title=How does Phish's ticketing mail order work? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

===Fifth member=== 	 
A dedicated group of fans <U+2014> CK5 <U+2014> unsuccessfully attempted to have [[Chris Kuroda]] officially recognized as a member of Phish. The band's lighting designer since 1989, Kuroda is completely responsible for the visual aspect of a Phish concert, establishing it as important as the aural.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/kuroda.html | title=Who runs the lights at Phish shows? |work=FAQ Files |publisher=phish.net |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>  As much of each concert is unrehearsed and improvisational, Kuroda is able to "play" the lights in time with the music.<ref>[http://www.phish.net/faq/lights.html What's the story behind those amazing lights at shows?] ''FAQ Files'' phish.net.  Accessed on May 8, 2009</ref>

===Comparisons to the Grateful Dead===
Phish is often compared to the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Sturgis |title=For Phish fans who dig the road, the music never really stopped |url=http://www.phisharchive.com/articles/1997/albany.html |work=Times Union (Albany, NY) |publisher=Phish Archives |date=1997-12-13 |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> but the similarity is cultural as well as musical.  Fans of both bands would often tour for weeks at a time, travel from show to show, and support themselves by selling food, homespun goods, and other goods to the pre-show parking lot community.

The comparison extends to the business practices of both bands: the primacy of live shows over studio albums and commercial appearances, the fan-friendly taping policies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.com/guidelines/index.php?category=6 | title=Phish and Band Member Taping Policy|work=Guidelines|publisher=phish.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemusicblog.com/discussion/05/11/30/grateful-dead-archiveorg-jesse-jarnow.php | title=Grateful Dead vs. Archive.org and The Fans|author=Jarnow, Jesse|publisher=Live Music Blog|date=2005-11-30|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> and generous archival release programs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gdlive.com/ | title=Live Dead, Archive Releases of the Grateful Dead|publisher=gdlive.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livephish.com/ | title=Live Phish, Archive Releases of Phish|publisher=livephish.com|accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> and the familial quality of the organizations themselves further align the legacies of the two bands.

Musically, the bands' similarity was more of ethic than aesthetic. Their embrace of group improvisation in a rock context is their unifying factor; however, Phish tended to more closely follow a jazz language or tradition in their playing (similar to [[The Allman Brothers Band]]),<ref name="Billy Breathes"/> which is very distinct from the Grateful Dead's roots in folk and [[Americana (music)|Americana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skewedperspective.com/longhairedlogicgd.html |author=Hiler, Mike |work=Long Haired Logic| publisher=skewedperspective.com| title=Grateful Dead: Debut Article |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref>

===Fan activities===
Like the Grateful Dead before them, which had legions of loyal fans nicknamed [[Deadhead]]s, fans of Phish <U+2014> known as ''phans'', ''phriends'', ''phamily'', ''Phishheads'', or any number of [[Ph (digraph)|ph]]-substituted appellations <U+2014> have created over a dozen fan organizations.  Maintained by fans for fans, these run the gamut of profit status, and indirectly work to the benefit of the band.  Among the more noticeable groups is "The Phellowship", a group that celebrated seeing shows sober together,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/phellow.html | title=What is The Phellowship? |work=FAQ Files | publisher=phish.net |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> and the "Green Crew" who worked after concerts removing trash and refuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phish.net/faq/greencrew.html | title=What is The Green Crew? How can I help? |work=FAQ Files| publisher=phish.net |accessdate=2008-05-11}}</ref> People for a Louder Mike (PLM) was an informal effort to campaign for the increase of Gordon's bass in the mix,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netspace.org/users/dan/plm/ | title=Homepage, People for a Louder Mike|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> there are organizations for gays and lesbians<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianrobert.com/ | title=BrianRobert.com <U+2014> Association of gay and lesbian Phish fans|accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref> as well as female fans,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phunky.com/ | title=The Phunky Bitches|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> and communities of fans on [[Usenet]] newsgroups such as rec.music.phish and on Phish.net.  [[Mockingbird Foundation|The Mockingbird Foundation]] <U+2014> a fan-run charitable organization dedicated to music education for children <U+2014> has announced two $5,000 grants as a result of the Reunion fund begun in fall of 2007: one to the town of Hampton, Virginia, and the other to the town of {{USCity|Hampton|Nebraska}}.<ref>[http://www.mockingbirdfoundation.org/press/2hamptons.html "$10K for 2 Hamptons!  Phish Fans Support Music Education in Virginia and Nebraska."] ''mockingbirdfoundation.org'' Accessed on October 2, 2008.</ref>

=== Live recording circulation ===
Because Phish's reputation was so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly-traded commodities.  Official soundboard recordings can be purchased through the Live Phish website, while legal [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]] produced by [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] with boom microphones from the audience are frequently traded on any number of music message boards.  Although technically not allowed, live video of Phish shows are also traded by fans and is tolerated as long as it is for non-profit, personal use.  Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.
