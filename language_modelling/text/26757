The '''Medal of Honor''' is the highest [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decoration]] awarded by the [[United States government]]. It is bestowed by the president, in the name of Congress, upon members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who distinguish themselves through "conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States."<ref name="regulations"/> Due to the nature of its criteria, it is often awarded [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]] (more than half have been since 1941).<ref name="posthumousQuantification">{{Cite book|last=Pullen|first=John J.|title=A Shower of Stars: The Medal of Honor and the 27th Maine|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, PA|year=1997|pages=preface p2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xGtImta-9QEC&dq=Pullen+A+Shower+of+stars&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=falseMany|accessdate=2010-04-15|isbn=978-0-8117-0075-7}}</ref>

Members of all branches of the armed forces are eligible to receive the medal, and there are three versions (one for the Army, one for the Air Force, and one for the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard). The Medal of Honor is then presented to the recipient or, for posthumous awards, to next of kin. The [[President of the United States]] presents the medal in person, on behalf of the Congress, representing and recognizing the gratitude of the American people as a whole. Due to its honored status, the medal is afforded special protection under U.S. law.<ref name="law">{{cite web|author=[[Office of the Law Revision Counsel]]|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000704----000-.html|title=18USC704(b)|work=US Code Collection|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref>

The Medal of Honor is one of two military [[neck order]] awards issued by the United States and is the sole neck order awarded to members of the armed forces (the Commander's Degree of the [[Legion of Merit]] is a neck order but it is only authorized for issue to foreign dignitaries).<ref name="neckorderLOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/legion_of_merit.aspx|title= Legion of Merit|work=Awards|publisher=Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>

As the award citation includes the phrase "in the name of Congress", it is sometimes erroneously called the ''Congressional'' Medal of Honor; however, the official title is simply the Medal of Honor.<ref name="TuckerArnold2011">{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C. |last2=Arnold|first2=James |last3=Wiener|first3=Roberta |title=The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607-1890: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JsM4A0GSO34C&pg=PA879|accessdate=2012-03-14|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-697-8|page=879}}</ref><ref name=CMOHS_name>The Congressional Medal of Honor Society is so named because that is the name it was given in an act of Congress signed into law by [[Dwight D.

==History==
The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by [[George Washington]] on August 7, 1782, when he created the [[Badge of Military Merit]], designed to recognize "any singularly meritorious action." This decoration is America's first combat award and the second oldest American military decoration of any type, after the [[Fidelity Medallion]].<ref name="regulations"/><ref name="merit">{{cite web|author=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|url=http://www.history.army.mil/faq/purhrt.htm|title=The Badge Of Military Merit/The Purple Heart|accessdate= 2006-07-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060718225026/http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/reference/PurHrt.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2006}}</ref>
[[File:Ortega meda of Honor.jpg|upright|thumb|Reverse of the Medal of Honor awarded to [[Seaman]] [[John Ortega]]]]
Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. armed forces had been established. In 1847, after the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]], a [[Certificate of Merit Medal|Certificate of Merit]] was established for soldiers who distinguished themselves in action. In 1918, the certificate was granted medal status as the [[Certificate of Merit Medal]].<ref name="Zabecki2008">{{cite book|last=Zabecki|first=David T. |title=American Artillery and the Medal of Honor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAttr-hmghUC&pg=PA11|accessdate=2012-03-14|year=2008|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]]|isbn=978-1-4357-5541-3|page=11}}</ref>

Early in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a medal for individual valor was proposed by Iowa Senator [[James W. Grimes]] to [[Winfield Scott]], the [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]] of the United States Army. Scott did not approve the proposal, but the medal did come into use in the Navy. Senate Bill 82, containing a provision for a "Medal of Honor", was signed into law (12Stat329)<ref name="valorhonor">{{cite web|url= http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/Vignettes/Vignette_78.htm|title=Two Chief Engineers Were Medal of Honor Recipients?|work=Did You Know?|publisher=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|accessdate=2006-07-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060818051221/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/Vignettes/Vignette_78.htm|archivedate=August 18, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on December 21, 1861. The medal was "to be bestowed upon such petty officers, seamen, landsmen, and Marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamanlike qualities during the present war."<ref name="MWxviii">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xviii}}</ref> Secretary of the Navy [[Gideon Welles]] directed the [[Philadelphia Mint]] to design the new decoration.<ref name="typessecnav">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal-types.php |title=Types of the Medal of Honor: 1862 To Present| publisher=Congressional Medal of Honor Society|accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> Shortly afterward, a resolution of similar wording was introduced on behalf of the Army and was signed into law on July 12, 1862. This measure provided for awarding a Medal of Honor, as the Navy version came to be called: "to such noncommissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the present insurrection."<ref name="MWxviii"/>

==Appearance==
The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance since its creation in 1862. The present Army medal consists of a gold star surrounded by a wreath, topped by an eagle on a bar inscribed with the word "Valor." The medal is attached by a hook to a light blue [[Moir<U+00E9> pattern|moir<U+00E9>]] silk neckband that is 1<sup>3</sup><U+2044><small>16</small> inches (30&nbsp;mm) in width and 21<U+00BE> inches (552&nbsp;mm) in length.<ref name="regulations"/><ref name="versions">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmohs.org/medal.htm|title=The Medal|publisher= Congressional Medal of Honor Society|accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref>

There is a version of the medal for each sub-[[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] component of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]: the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], and [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]]. Before 1965, when the U.S. Air Force design was adopted, members of the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]], [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[U.S. Air Force]] received the Army version of the medal.<ref name="MWxxvi">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xxvi}}</ref>

As the [[United States Coast Guard]] is subsumed into the U.S. Navy in time of declared war, the only member of the Coast Guard to have received a Medal of Honor, Signalman 1st Class [[Douglas Albert Munro|Douglas Munro]], was posthumously awarded the Navy version for action during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]].<ref name=CD19>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=19}}</ref> A separate Coast Guard medal was established in 1963, but no design yet exists for it.<ref name=navyfaq>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/faq.html |title=Medal of Honor, Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}</ref>

In the rare cases (19 thus far) where a service member has been awarded more than one Medal of Honor, current regulations specify that an appropriate award device be centered on the Medal of Honor ribbon and neck medal. To indicate multiple presentations of the Medal of Honor, the U.S. Army and Air Force bestow [[oak leaf cluster]]s, while the Navy Medal of Honor is worn with gold [[award star]]s.<ref name="double">{{cite web|url = http://www.cmohs.org/double-recipients.php |title = Double Recipients |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2012-03-14}}</ref>

A [[ribbon bar]] that is the same shade of light blue as the neckband, and includes five white stars, pointed upwards, in the shape of an "M" is worn for situations other than full dress uniform. When the ribbon is worn, it is placed in the first position (top left when seen on the uniform) in order of precedence. For wear with civilian clothing, a [[rosette (decoration)|rosette]] is issued instead of a miniature lapel pin (which usually shows the ribbon bar). The rosette is the same shade of blue as the neck ribbon and includes white stars. The ribbon and rosette are presented at the same time as the medal.<ref name="typessecnav"/>

===Flag===
[[File:Medal of Honor Flag with Gold Fringe.svg|thumb|Medal of Honor Flag]]
On October 23, 2002, {{USPL|107|248}} was enacted, modifying {{UnitedStatesCode|36|903}}, authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to recipients of the decoration.<ref name="flaglaw">{{cite web|year = 23 Oct 2002 |url = http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/36C9.txt |title = Designation of the Medal of Honor Flag |publisher = US Code.gov |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

The flag was based on a concept by retired [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] First Sergeant Bill Kendall of [[Jefferson, Iowa]],<ref name="Kendall">{{cite web|url = http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=7244|title = Special Forces veteran's idea leads to new Medal of Honor flag |publisher = Army News Service|accessdate = 2006-07-24|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060111151709/http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=7244 |archivedate = January 11, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> who designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain [[Darrell Lindsey]], a [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] pilot killed in World War II who was from Jefferson. Kendall's design of a light blue field emblazoned with 13 white five-pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah LeClerc's of the [[U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry|Institute of Heraldry]]. LeClerc's design, ultimately accepted as the official flag, does not include the words "Medal of Honor" and is fringed in gold. The color of the field and the 13 white stars, arranged in the form of a three bar [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]], consisting of two chevrons of five stars and one chevron of three stars,<ref name="regulations"/> replicate the Medal of Honor ribbon. The flag has no set proportions.<ref name="flag">{{cite web|url = http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Flags_Guidons/MedalOfHonorFlag.htm |title = Medal of Honor Flag |work = The Institute of Heraldry |publisher = US Army |accessdate = 2006-07-21| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060911012812/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Flags_Guidons/MedalOfHonorFlag.htm| archivedate = September 11, 2006}}</ref>

There are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The first and most common is nomination and approval through a service member's [[chain of command]]. The second method is nomination by a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]] (generally at the request of a constituent) and approval by a special [[act of Congress]]. In both cases, the Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of and in the name of the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/moh.html |title=Medal of Honor Citations |publisher=History.army.mil |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>

===Evolution of criteria===
Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21, 1861, a similar resolution for the Army was passed. Six [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked the ''General'']], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] were the first recipients.<ref name="MWxvii">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xvii}}</ref> Raid leader [[James J. Andrews]], a civilian hanged as a Union spy, did not receive the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with saving the flag, not just for patriotic reasons, but because the flag was a primary means of battlefield communication. During the time of the Civil War, no other military award was authorized, and to many this explains why some seemingly less notable actions were recognized by the Medal of Honor during that war. The criteria for the award tightened after [[World War I]] and starting in 1942, the medal would be awarded only for action in combat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq38-1.htm|title=The Navy's Medal of Honor|accessdate=2012-01-26|publisher=US Navy}}</ref>

Early in the 20th century, the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, seven sailors aboard the {{USS|Iowa|BB-4}} received the medal when a boiler exploded on January 25, 1904. Aboard the {{USS|Chicago|CA-14}} in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] received the medal for saving the ship's cook from drowning. Even after World War I, [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]] and [[Floyd Bennett]] received the medal for exploration of the [[North Pole]].<ref name="HargisSinton2003">{{cite book|last1=argis|first1=Robert H|last2=Sinton|first2=Starr |title=World War II Medal of Honor recipients (1): Navy & USMC|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JdGr1QFy9HwC&pg=PA6|accessdate=2012-03-14|year=2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-613-3|page=6}}</ref>  [[Thomas J.

Between 1919 and 1942, the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor, one for non-combat bravery and the other for combat-related acts. Official accounts vary, but generally the combat Medal of Honor was known as the Tiffany Cross, after the company that [[Tiffany & Co.|designed the medal]]. The Tiffany Cross was first awarded in 1919, but was unpopular, partly because of its design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=7048|title="Tiffany" Medal of Honor Comes to Navy Museum|date=2003-04-27|last=Birnie|first=Michael|publisher=United States Navy|work=[[U.S. Navy Museum]]|accessdate=2010-02-15}}</ref> There were two awards of the Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor for non-combat to Commander, later Rear Admiral Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett for their flight over the North Pole in 1926, as authorized by a special act of congress.

Since the beginning of World War II, the medal has been awarded for extreme bravery beyond the call of duty while engaged in action against an enemy. Arising from these criteria, approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously.<ref name="mohstats">{{cite web|month = May | year = 2003 |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohstats.html |title = Medal of Honor Statistics |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref> Capt.

==Legal protection==
Until late 2006, the Medal of Honor was the only service decoration afforded special protection under federal law to prevent it from being imitated or privately sold. The [[Stolen Valor Act of 2005]], enacted December 20, 2006 but later ruled to be unconstitutional, extended federal protection to include false verbal, written, or physical claims to other military decorations, service medals, or military badges to which a person is not entitled.<ref name="s1998track">{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-1998 |title=S. 1998: Stolen Valor Act of 2005 |work=109th U.S. Congress (2005<U+2013>2006) |publisher=GovTrak.us |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{usc|18|704}}</ref> In [[United States v. Alvarez]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in 2010 that the Stolen Valor Act was unconstitutional.  In a 2-1 decision, it stated that the Act was a violation of [[free speech]] because it did not fall within one of the previously announced exceptions to free speech, and the speech it proscribed was, therefore, [[protected speech]].  The Court went on to find that while the driving purpose of the law was compelling, the law was not narrowly tailored to meet that purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/aug/18/appeals-court-stolen-valor-act-unconstitutional/ |title=Appeals court: Stolen Valor Act unconstitutional |date=August 18, 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Washington Times |accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref> On February 22, 2012, the Supreme Court heard arguments in an appeal of the 9th Circuit's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/11-210.pdf|title=IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, UNITED STATES v.

[[File:Moh2.jpg|right|thumb|The Medal of Honor on display]]
The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] issues all Medals of Honor to recipients in the original only. A duplicate medal (marked as such) may be issued, free of charge, to replace a lost, destroyed or stolen one upon written application, subject to approval of the service secretary. Misuse of the medal, including unauthorized manufacture or wear, is punishable by a fine up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to one year pursuant to {{uscsub|18|704|b}}. After the Army redesigned its medal in 1903, a [[patent]] was issued<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?q=D37236 |title=D37236 - Google Patents |publisher=Google.com |date=1904-11-22 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> to legally prevent others from making the medal. When the patent expired, the Federal government enacted a law making it illegal to produce, wear, or distribute the Medal of Honor without proper authority. A number of veterans' organizations and private companies devote themselves to exposing those who falsely claim to have received the Medal of Honor.<ref name="phony">{{Cite news|last = Chozick |first = Amy |url = http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB111533986173926430-K_XMqM2Fe4Gn2S_wmni1njavo2k_20060505.html?mod=blogs |title = Veterans' Web Sites Expose Pseudo Heroes, Phony Honors |publisher = Wall Street Journal |accessdate = 2006-07-20 | date=2005-05-06}}</ref>

===Enforcement===
HLI Lordship Industries Inc., a former Medal of Honor contractor, was fined in 1996 for selling 300 medals for US $75 each.<ref name="hli2">{{Cite news|date = December 4, 1996 |url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/04/briefs/medal.html |title = Company fined for selling fake Medals of Honor |work = US News |publisher = CNN |accessdate = 2006-07-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060203042609/http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/04/briefs/medal.html |archivedate = February 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

In that year, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, resident Jackie Stern was convicted of wearing a medal to which he was not entitled; instead of six months in jail, a federal judge sentenced him to serve one year's probation and to write a letter of apology to each of the then living 171 recipients of the medal; the letter was published in the local newspaper.<ref name="stern">{{Cite news|date = December 4, 1996 |url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/04/medal.without.honor/ |title = Florida Man wears medal without Honor |work = US News |publisher = CNN |accessdate = 2006-09-30}}</ref>

In 2003, Edward Fedora and Gisela Fedora were charged with violating {{uscsub|18|704|b}}, ''Unlawful Sale of a Medal of Honor'', for selling medals awarded to U.S. Navy Sailor [[Robert Blume]] (for action in the [[Spanish-American War]]) and to U.S. Army First Sergeant George Washington Roosevelt (for action in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]) to an [[FBI]] agent.<ref name="blume">{{cite web|date = July 9, 2003 |url = http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel03/metal070903.htm |title = Defendants Charged With Conspiracy to Sell Several Congressional Medals of Honor |publisher = Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate = 2006-07-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060720022357/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel03/metal070903.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> Edward Fedora pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.<ref name="edward">{{cite web|date = May 28, 2004 |url = http://www.fbi.gov/page2/may04/052804medal.htm |title = Honoring Our Veterans |publisher = Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

==Recipients==
{{Main|List of Medal of Honor recipients}}
As of 2006, 3,475 medals have been awarded to 3,456 different people.<ref name="mohshistory">{{cite web|url = http://www.cmohs.org/society-history.php |title = The Congressional Medal of Honor Society's History |work = Official Site |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2012-03-14}}</ref><ref name="usmcmoh">{{cite web|url = http://www.usmc.mil/moh.nsf/ |title = Marines Awarded the Medal of Honor |publisher = US Marine Corps |accessdate = 2006-07-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060727232259/http://www.usmc.mil/moh.nsf/ |archivedate = July 27, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Nineteen men received a second award: 14 of these received two separate medals for two separate actions, and five received both the Navy and the Army Medals of Honor for the same action. For actions since the beginning of World War II, 861 Medals of Honor have been awarded, 530 (or 62%) posthumously. In total, 627 of the medals have been awarded posthumously.<ref name="mohstats"/>

The first Army Medal of Honor was awarded to Private [[Jacob Parrott]] during the American Civil War for his role in the [[Andrews Raid]].<ref name="MWxviii"/> The only female Medal of Honor recipient is [[Mary Edwards Walker]], a Civil War surgeon. Her medal was rescinded in 1917 along with many other non-combat awards, but it was restored by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977 (see Evolution of Criteria, above).<ref name="walker">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=8}}</ref>

While current regulations, ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|6241}}), beginning in 1918, explicitly state that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award, exceptions have been made. For example, [[Charles Lindbergh]], while a reserve member of the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]], received his Medal of Honor as a civilian pilot.<ref name="HargisSinton2003"/> In addition, the Medal of Honor was presented to the [[The Unknown Warrior|British Unknown Warrior]] by [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]] on October 17, 1921. On November 11, 1921, the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|U.S. Unknown Soldier]] was reciprocally awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the British military's highest award for valor. Apart from these few exceptions, Medals of Honor can be awarded only to members of the U.S. armed forces<U+2014>although being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite. Sixty-one [[Canada|Canadians]] who were serving in the United States armed forces have been awarded the Medal of Honor, with a majority awarded for actions in the American Civil War. Since 1900, only four have been awarded to Canadians.<ref name="cbc">{{Cite news|date = July 1, 2005 |url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/01/canadians-usmedal050701.html |title = Canada honours winners of top U.S. medal |publisher = CBC News|accessdate = 2006-07-20|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070529190113/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/01/canadians-usmedal050701.html |archivedate = May 29, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> In the Vietnam War, [[Peter C.

===Post-Vietnam===
For actions occurring since the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam in 1973, the Medal of Honor has been awarded twelve times, nine of them posthumously. The first two were earned by [[Delta Force]] snipers Sergeant First Class [[Randy Shughart]] and Master Sergeant [[Gary Gordon]], who defended downed [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopter pilot Chief Warrant Officer [[Michael Durant]] and his crew during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993. Both men lost their lives in doing so.<ref name=CD28>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=28}}</ref>

From the end of the Vietnam War until 2010, no living person received the Medal of Honor for actions in an ongoing conflict. This affected the number of [[List of living Medal of Honor recipients|living holders]] with fewer than 100 recipients still alive in 2010. The ''[[Army Times]]'' published an article analyzing the lack of non-posthumous awards in its March 30, 2009 issue, before the September 2010 award to [[Salvatore Giunta]]. It was suggested that because of the intense [[partisan politics]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] over these wars, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] subjected potential Medal of Honor recipients to intense background checks so as to avoid scrutiny, from political opponents, of both the administration and the recipient.<ref name="DBTH">{{cite web|last=McGarry|first=Brendan|title=Death before this honor|url= http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/03/military_medal_of_honor_032509w/|date=1 April 2009|work=[[Army Times]]|publisher=[[Army Times Publishing Company]]|accessdate=2012-03-14}}</ref>

Four servicemen were awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in the [[Iraq War]]: Army Sergeant First Class [[Paul Ray Smith]], Army Private First Class [[Ross A. McGinnis]], Marine Corps Corporal [[Jason Dunham]] and Navy SEAL, Master-at-Arms Second Class [[Michael A. Monsoor]]. In April 2003, Smith organized the defense of a prisoner of war holding area that was attacked by a company-sized Iraqi force, personally manning a machine gun under fire until being killed. The remaining three medals were awarded for [[falling on a grenade]]; Dunham threw himself on a grenade to save his fellow Marines in an April 2004 mission, McGinnis covered a grenade which was tossed into his vehicle while on a mounted patrol in December 2006, and Monsoor jumped on a grenade which was thrown in the midst of his SEAL sniper team in September 2006.<ref name="mohiraq">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/iraq.html |title=Medal of Honor Recipients - Iraq |work=Medal of Honor Citations |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>

==27th Maine and other revoked awardings==

During the Civil War, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the [[27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] who extended his enlistment beyond the agreed upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned. Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.<ref name="MWxix">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xix}}</ref>

In 1916, a board of five generals on the retired list convened by law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded. The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service. The commission, led by [[Nelson A. Miles]], identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service. This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine, 29 who served as Abraham Lincoln's funeral guard, six civilians (including Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]], the only woman to have been awarded the medal, and [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]]), as well as 12 others.<ref name="MWxxv">{{harvnb|Mikaelian|Wallace|2003|p=xxv}}</ref><ref name=CD15>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=15}}</ref> Dr. Walker's medal was restored by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977.<ref name="walker"/> Cody and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service action and who were considered by the board to have fully earned their medals had theirs restored in 1989.<ref name=CD16>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=16}}</ref> The report was endorsed by the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]], who advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the medals from the recipients identified by the board. In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute.<ref>66th Congress 1st Session, Document 58, General Staff and Medals of Honor, ordered to be printed 23 July 1919.</ref>

==Past racial discrimination==
A 1993 study commissioned by the Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals.<ref name="African">{{cite web|url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohb.html |title = WWII African American MOH recipients |publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to black soldiers who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that several black [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] recipients be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] presented the medal to seven [[African American]] World War II veterans. With the passing of [[Vernon Baker]], all of these recipients have now died.<ref name=CD25/>

A similar study of [[Asian American]]s in 1998 resulted in President [[Bill Clinton]] presenting 21 new Medals of Honor in 2000, including 20 to [[Japanese American]] members of the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], among them Senator [[Daniel Inouye]].<ref name=CD25>{{harvnb|Collier|Del Calzo|2006|p=25}}</ref> In 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] presented the Medal of Honor to Jewish veteran and [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Tibor Rubin]], whom many believed to have been overlooked because of his religion.<ref name="Asian">{{cite web|last =Williams |first = Rdui |date = May 19, 2000 |url = http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45192 |title = 21 Asian American World War II Vets to Get Medal of Honor |work = American Forces Press Service News Articles |publisher = Department of Defense |accessdate = 2008-07-21}}</ref><ref name="JewishLib">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/tibor_rubin.html|title=Tibor Rubin|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref>

==Similar decorations within the United States==
The following United States decorations bear similar names to the Medal of Honor, but are separate awards with different criteria for issuance.
* [[Cardenas Medal of Honor]]: decoration of the [[Revenue Cutter Service]], merged into the [[United States Coast Guard]]
* [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]]: awarded posthumously for a single action to [[Four Chaplains|four recipients]]
* [[Congressional Gold Medal]]: the highest civilian honor (along with the Presidential Medal of Freedom)
* [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]]: for astronauts but despite its name, not equal to the Medal of Honor
* [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]: the highest civilian honor (along with the Congressional Gold Medal)
* The [[Southern Cross of Honor]] was a military decoration meant to honor the officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates for their valor in the armed forces of the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It was formally approved by the [[Congress of the Confederate States]] on October 13, 1862,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.jmu.edu/special/manuscripts/2060_UDC_CrossofHonor.aspx |title=A Guide to the United Daughters of the Confederacy Southern Cross of Honor Documents |publisher=James Madison University Libraries |accessdate=2012-01-26}}</ref> and was originally intended to be on par with the Union Army's Medal of Honor.

Several [[United States law enforcement decorations]] bear the name "Medal of Honor". The [[Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor]], established by Congress in 2001, "the highest national award for valor by a public safety officer", is awarded by the President.<ref>{{cite web
