China Railways use single fare standard across the country. The ticket price is established by the rate-making distance (<U+8FD0><U+4EF7><U+91CC><U+7A0B>), which usually equals to the actual rail distance.

== CRH trains ==

The CRH trains' fare was introduced on April 18, 2007.

=== Seat ===

There are three types of seats on CRH trains: deluxe, first, and second; The deluxe-class only found on [[China Railways CRH3|CRH3C]] trains.

; 200<U+2013>250 km/h trains:
* Second class: <U+00A5>0.2805/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> rate-making distance + Insurance
* First class: <U+00A5>0.2805/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 1.2 <U+00D7> rate-making distance + Insurance
* Insurance (required): <U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> rate-making distance <U+00D7> 0.02

Some CRH trains run on conventional low-speed tracks have special discount. Some long distance train's second-class seat equals to a hard sleeper of the same distance when it is more expensive.

=== Sleeper ===

There are two types of sleepers on CRH trains: normal sleeper or deluxe sleeper; The deluxe-class only found on [[China Railways CRH1|CRH1E]] trains. Each type of sleeper has upper or lower options.

The fare of a sleeper CRH train follows the formula:
* Upper berth: <U+00A5>0.3366/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 1.6 <U+00D7> rate-making distance + Insurance<ref><U+5173><U+4E8E><U+52A8><U+8F66><U+7EC4><U+8F6F><U+5367><U+7968><U+4EF7><U+6709><U+5173><U+4E8B><U+9879><U+7684><U+901A><U+77E5> (<U+94C1><U+8FD0><U+7535> [2008] 135<U+53F7>)<br />Notice on the Soft Sleeper Ticket Price of the CRH (Ministry of Railways Transport Bureau Telegram No. [2008] 135)</ref>
* Lower berth: <U+00A5>0.3366/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 1.8 <U+00D7> rate-making distance + Insurance

* Deluxe lower berth: <U+00A5>0.3366/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 3.6 <U+00D7> rate-making distance + Insurance
* Insurance (required): <U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> rate-making distance <U+00D7> 0.02

Some train has special discount, for example, the sleeper train between [[Beijing Railway Station|Beijing]] and [[Shanghai Railway Station|Shanghai]] provides 25% discount to the price above. For example, the train D301 from Beijing to Shanghai (rate-making distance = 1463 km), the price is calculated as:
* Upper berth: round_to_<U+00A5>5((<U+00A5>0.3366/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 1.6 <U+00D7> 1463 km + <U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> 1463 km <U+00D7> 0.02) <U+00D7> 0.75) = <U+00A5>655
* Lower berth: round_to_<U+00A5>5((<U+00A5>0.3366/km <U+00D7> 1.1 <U+00D7> 1.8 <U+00D7> 1463 km + <U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> 1463 km <U+00D7> 0.02) <U+00D7> 0.75) = <U+00A5>730

== Conventional trains ==

For conventional trains, the fare basis has changed several times in history. The last time it changed was on October 1, 1995, when it was changed to <U+00A5>0.05861 per kilometer. The fare vary by trains' speed, air-conditioning, and travel class (seat or sleeper).

A train ticket is composed by passenger ticket, speed-up ticket, air-conditioning ticket, sleeper ticket, insurance and others.

; Passenger ticket with insurance:

There are two different of passenger tickets: hard and soft. A hard-seat or hard-sleeper ticket requires a hard passenger ticket, while a soft-seat, soft-sleeper or deluxe-soft-sleeper ticket requires a soft passenger ticket.

The fare of a hard passenger ticket equals to the fare basis (<U+00A5>0.05861 per kilometer). The fare of a soft passenger ticket is double. And if the distance is shorter than 20 km, 20 km is charged.

Insurance of 2% of a hard seat fare, or <U+00A5>0.0011722/km, is required for every passenger. The final price of a passenger ticket with insurance is calculated as:

Hard: round_to_<U+00A5>1(<U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> rate-making distance + ceil_to_<U+00A5>0.1(<U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> 2% <U+00D7> rate-making distance))
Soft: round_to_<U+00A5>1(<U+00A5>0.11722/km <U+00D7> rate-making distance + ceil_to_<U+00A5>0.1(<U+00A5>0.05861/km <U+00D7> 2% <U+00D7> rate-making distance))

; Speed-up ticket

There are three classes by speed:
* Normal passenger (<U+666E><U+5BA2>), trains numbered from 6001 to 8998
** No speed-up ticket is required for this class
* Normal fast (<U+666E><U+5FEB>), trains numbered from 1001 to 5998
** Fare of speed-up ticket is 20% of fare basis (<U+00A5>0.011722 per kilometer) for this class
* Fast (<U+5FEB><U+901F>) / Express (<U+7279><U+5FEB>), trains prefixed with letter [[K-series|K]], [[T-series|T]], or [[Z-series|Z]]
** Fare of speed-up ticket is 40% of fare basis (<U+00A5>0.023444 per kilometer) for this class

If the distance is shorter than 100 km, 100 km is charged. The price of a speed-up ticket is rounded to <U+00A5>1.

; Air-conditioning ticket:

Fare of an air-conditioning ticket equals to 25% of fare basis, or <U+00A5>0.0146525 per kilometer.

If a train has an air-conditioning system, air-conditioning ticket is required. As of 2009, almost all trains have a "new-type" air-conditioning system, that the air-conditioning system is centralized powered by locomotive or special power generation (KD) car. The price of passenger with insurance, sleeper-up, air-conditioning and sleeper tickets of a train with "new-type" air-conditioning system is 50% higher than normal trains, or 80% higher if it is a deluxe sleeper.

The price of an air-conditioning ticket is rounded to <U+00A5>1.

; Sleeper ticket:

* Soft upper berth: <U+00A5>0.1025675/km
* Soft lower berth: <U+00A5>0.1142895/km
* Deluxe soft upper berth: <U+00A5>0.123081/km
* Deluxe soft lower berth: <U+00A5>0.134803/km

Any sleeper ticket is charged an extra <U+00A5>10.00 than the above formulas. If the distance is shorter than 400 km, 400 km is charged. The price of a sleeper ticket is rounded to <U+00A5>1.

Rounded to <U+00A5>1.00.

; About rate-making distance:

The rate-making distance is rounded up using the following rules:

* 1 km <U+2013> 200 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 10) * 10 - 5
* 201 km <U+2013> 400 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 20) * 20 - 10
* 401 km <U+2013> 700 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 30) * 30 - 15
* 701 km <U+2013> 1100 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 40) * 40 - 20
* 1101 km <U+2013> 1600 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 50) * 50 - 25
* 1601 km <U+2013> 2200 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 60) * 60 - 30
* 2201 km <U+2013> 2900 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 70) * 70 - 35
* 2901 km <U+2013> 3700 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 80) * 80 - 40
* 3701 km <U+2013> 4600 km: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 90) * 90 - 45
* 4601 km <U+2014>: ceil(distance <U+00F7> 100) * 100 - 50

For example, the rate-making distance between Beijing and Shanghai is 1463 km, the distance value 1475 km used to calculate the price.

; About long-distance discount:

For above prices and trip longer or equals to 201 km, the following discount rule is applied:

* 201st km <U+2013> 500th km section: 90%
* 501st km <U+2013> 1000th km section: 80%
* 1001st km <U+2013> 1500th km section: 70%
* 1501st km <U+2013> 2500th km section: 60%
* 2501st km and above section: 50%

; Ticketing system development extra charge:

For ticket price less than or equal to <U+00A5>5.00, <U+00A5>1.00 is added, or <U+00A5>0.50 is added. For hard-class travels <U+2265> 200 km, train station air-conditioning fee <U+00A5>1.00 is charged.

For example, for the <U+201C>new-type air-conditioning normal-fast<U+201D> train 1363 from [[Beijing West Railway Station|Beijing West]] to [[Zhengzhou Railway Station|Zhengzhou]] (rate-making distance=689 km), so 685 km is used according to the rule above, the upper berth price is calculated as:
* Passenger ticket and insurance:
** First 200 km: <U+00A5>0.11722/km * 200 km = <U+00A5>23.444
** 201st km <U+2013> 500th km: <U+00A5>0.11722/km * 300 km * 90% = <U+00A5>31.6494
** 501st km <U+2013> 685th km: <U+00A5>0.11722/km * 185 km * 80% = <U+00A5>17.34856
