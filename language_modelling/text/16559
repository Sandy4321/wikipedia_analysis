'''Thutmose I''' (sometimes read as ''Thothmes,'' ''Thutmosis'' or ''Tuthmosis I'', meaning ''[[Thoth]]-Born'') was the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] of [[History of Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. He was given the throne after the death of the previous king [[Amenhotep I]]. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt further than ever before. He also built many temples in Egypt and built a tomb for himself in the [[Valley of the Kings]]; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him). He was succeeded by his son [[Thutmose II]], who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II's sister, [[Hatshepsut]]. His reign is [[Thutmose I#Dates and length of reign|generally dated from 1506 to 1493]] [[Anno Domini|BC]], but a minority of scholars, who feel that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records and thus the reign of Thutmose I,  were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes, would date his reign from 1526 BC to 1513 BC.<ref> Grimal, Nicolas. A History of Ancient Egypt. p.202. Librairie Arth<U+00E9>me Fayard, 1988.</ref><ref>Ancient Egyptian Chronology, chapter 10, Egyptian Sirius/Sothic Dates and the Question of the Sirius based Lunar Calender, 2006 Rolf Krauss pgs. 439-457</ref>

==Family==
It has been speculated Thutmose's father was Amenhotep I. His mother, [[Senseneb]], was of non-royal parentage and may have been a lesser wife or concubine.<ref>[http://euler.slu.edu/~bart/egyptianhtml/kings%20and%20Queens/Tuthmosis-I.html] accessed 2 May 2010</ref> [[Queen Ahmose]], who held the title of [[Great Royal Wife]] of Thutmose, was probably the daughter of [[Ahmose I]] and the sister of [[Amenhotep I]];<ref name="Gardiner   176">Gardiner 1964 p. 176</ref> however, she was never called "king's daughter," so there is some doubt about this, and some historians believe that she was Thutmose's own sister.<ref name="Bleiberg 400">Bleiberg (2000) p.400</ref> Assuming she was related to Amenhotep, it could be thought that she was married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession.  However, this is known not to be the case for two reasons. Firstly, Amenhotep's alabaster bark built at [[Karnak]] associates Amenhotep's name with Thutmose's name well before Amenhotep's death.<ref name="Grimal 203">Grimal (1988) p.203</ref> Secondly, Thutmose's first born son with [[Queen Ahmose|Ahmose]], [[Amenmose (prince)|Amenmose]], was apparently born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from Thutmose's fourth regnal year hunting near Memphis, and he became the "great army-commander of his father" sometime before his death, which was no later than Thutmose's own death in his 12th regnal year.<ref name="Gardiner 179">Gardiner (1964) p.179</ref> Thutmose had another son, [[Wadjmose]], and two daughters, [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Nefrubity]], by [[Queen Ahmose|Ahmose]]. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant.<ref name="Steindorff 36">Steindorff (1942) p.36</ref> Thutmose had one son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son succeeded him as [[Thutmose II]], whom Thutmose I married to his daughter, [[Hatshepsut]].<ref name="Steindorff 36"/> It was later recorded by Hatshepsut that Thutmose willed the kingship to both Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to legitimise her claim to the throne when she later assumed power.<ref>Erman (1894) p.43</ref>

==Dates and length of reign==
A [[heliacal rising]] of [[Sothis]] was recorded in the reign of Thutmose's predecessor, Amenhotep I, which has been dated to [[1517 BC]], assuming the observation was made at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].<ref name="Grimal 202">Grimal (1988) p.202</ref> The year of Amenhotep's death and Thutmose's subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived, and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars. However, if the observation were made at either [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], as a minority of scholars promote, Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.<ref>Helk (1983) pp.47-9</ref>
[[Manetho]] records that Thutmose I's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months (or 13 Years) as a certain '''Mephres''' in his Epitome.<ref>{{cite web | title = Manetho's Kings | url=http://www.myegyptology.net/file/id21.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-30 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19960101-re_/http://www.myegyptology.net/file/id21.htm|archivedate=2002-12-21}}</ref> This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign bearing his cartouche found inscribed on a stone block in Karnak.<ref>J<U+00FC>rgen von Beckerath (1997), p.120</ref> Accordingly, Thutmose is usually given a reign from 1506 BC to 1493 BC in the low chronology, but a minority of scholars would date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC<ref name="Grimal 202"/>

==Military achievements==
[[File:Egypt 1450 BC.svg|thumb|right|The maximum territorial extent of Egypt (XVth century BC)]]
Upon Thutmose's coronation, Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule. According to the tomb autobiography of [[Ahmose, son of Ebana]], Thutmose travelled down the Nile and fought in the battle, personally killing the Nubian king.<ref name="Steindorff 34">Steindorff and Seele (1942) p.34</ref> Upon victory, he had the Nubian king's body hung from the prow of his ship, before he returned to [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]].<ref name="Steindorff 34"/> After that campaign, he led a second expedition against Nubia in his third year in the course of which he ordered the canal at the first cataract<U+2014>which had been built under [[Sesostris III]] of the 12th Dynasty<U+2014>to be [[dredge]]d in order to facilitate easier travel upstream from Egypt to Nubia. This helped integrate Nubia into the Egyptian empire.<ref name="Steindorff 36"/> This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king's son Thure:<ref>Lorna Oakes, Pyramids, Temples and Tombs of Ancient Egypt, Hermes House, 2003. p.207</ref>
{{blockquote| Year 3, first month of the third season, day 22, under the majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Aakheperre who is given life. His Majesty commanded to dig this canal after he found it stopped up with stones [so that] no [ship sailed upon it];
Year 3, first month of the third season, day 22. His Majesty sailed this canal in victory and in the power of his return from overthrowing the wretched [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]].<ref>Oakes, op. cit., p.207</ref>}}

In the second year of Thutmose's reign, the king cut a [[stele]] at Tombos, which records that he built a fortress at Tombos, near the third cataract, thus permanently extending the Egyptian military presence, which had previously stopped at [[Buhen]], at the second cataract.<ref>Breasted (1906) p.28</ref> This indicates that he already fought a campaign in Syria; hence, his Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of his second regnal year.<ref name="Steindorff 35">Steindorff and Seele (1942) p.35</ref>  This second campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. Although it has not been found in modern times, he apparently set up a stele when he crossed the [[Euphrates River]].<ref name="Shaw 289">Shaw and Nicholson (1995) p.289</ref> During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose. However, after he returned, they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions.<ref name="Steindorff 36"/> Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of [[Niya (kingdom)|Niy]], near Apamea in Syria,<ref name="Gardiner 179"/> and returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, "that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream."<ref name="Steindorff 36"/> The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had ever encountered which flowed from the north, which was downstream on the [[River Nile|Nile]], to the south, which was upstream on the Nile. Thus the river became known in Egypt as simply, "inverted water."<ref name="Steindorff 36"/>

Thutmose had to face one more military threat, another rebellion by Nubia in his fourth year.<ref name="Steindorff 35"/> His influence accordingly expanded even farther south, as an inscription dated to his reign has been found as far south as Kurgus, which was south of the fourth cataract.<ref name="Shaw 289"/> During his reign, he initiated a number of projects which effectively ended Nubian independence for the next 500 years. He enlarged a temple to Sesostris III and Khnum, opposite the Nile from [[Semna]].<ref>Erman (1894) p.503</ref> There are also records of specific religious rites which the viceroy of El-Kab was to have performed in the temples in Nubia in proxy for the king.<ref>Breasted (1906) p.25</ref> He also appointed a man called Turi to the position of [[viceroy of Cush]], also known as the "King's Son of Cush."<ref>Breasted (1906) p.27</ref> With a civilian representative of the king permanently established in Nubia itself, Nubia did not dare to revolt as often as it had and was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings.<ref name="Steindorff 35"/>

==Building projects==
[[File:Stela of Tuthmosis I.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Stela of Thutmose I in the Cairo Museum]]
[[File:Karnak-obelisk-thoutmesI.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Court of the 4th pylon: obelisk of Thutmose I at Karnak]]
Thutmose I organized great building projects during his reign, including many [[Egyptian temple|temples]] and tombs, but his greatest projects were at the [[Temple of Karnak]] under the supervision of the architect [[Ineni]].<ref name="Breasted 41">Breasted (1906) p.41</ref> Previous to Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road.<ref name="Grimal 300">Grimal (1988) p.300</ref> Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple's main road, along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway.<ref name="Grimal 300"/> Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall.<ref name="Grimal 300"/> Between pylons four and five, he had a [[hypostyle hall]] constructed, with columns made of [[Cedrus|cedar]] wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation.<ref>Shaw (2003) p.168</ref> Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt.<ref name="Grimal 300"/> Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles<ref name="Grimal 300"/> and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until [[Thutmose III]] inscribed it about 50 years later.<ref name="Breasted 41"/> The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself.<ref name="Breasted 41"/> Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.<ref name="Grimal 300"/>

In addition to Karnak, Thutmose I also built statues of the [[Ennead]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], buildings at Armant, Ombos, [[Al-Hibah|el-Hiba]], Memphis, and Edfu, as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia, at Semna, Buhen, Aniba, and Quban.<ref>{{cite web | title = Thutmosis I | url=http://touregypt.net/featurestories/tuthmosis1.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-02 | work = touregypt.net}}</ref>

Thutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]].<ref name="Shaw 289"/> Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple.<ref name="Gardiner 179"/> His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]].<ref>Gardiner (1964) p.170</ref> His tomb, however, has been identified as [[KV38]]. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I.<ref name="Gardiner 176"/> His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, [[KV20]], which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.<ref name="Shaw 289"/>

==Death and burial==
Thutmose I was originally buried and then reburied in [[KV20]] in a double burial with his daughter Hatshepsut rather than [[KV38]] which could only have been built for Thutmose I during the reign of his grandson Thutmose III based on "a recent re-examination of the architecture and contents of KV38."<ref>Joyce Tyldesley, Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh, Penguin Books, hardback, 1996. pp.121-25</ref> The location of KV20, if not its original owner, had long been known since the Napoleonic expedition of 1799 and, in 1844, the Prussian scholar [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] had partially explored its upper passage.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.122">Tyldesley, p.122</ref> However, all its passageways "had become blocked by a solidified mass of rubble, small stones and rubbish which had been carried into the tomb by floodwaters" and it was not until the 1903-1904 excavation season that [[Howard Carter]], after 2 previous seasons of strenuous work, was able to clear its corridors and enter its double burial chamber.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.122"/> Here, among the debris of broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages were the remnants of two vases made for Queen [[Ahmose Nefertari]] which formed part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I; one of the vases contained a secondary inscription which states that Thutmose II "[made it] as his monument to his father."<ref>Tyldesley, pp.123-24</ref> Other vessels which bore the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II, as well as fragments of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king as well as other vessels which bore her royal name of 'Maatkare' which would have been made only after she took the throne in her own right.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.124">Tyldesley, p.124</ref>

[[File:Hatshepsut's sarcophagus for Thutmose I.jpg|thumb|right|310px|[[Hatshepsut]] donated this quartzite sarcophagus which was made in her reign for the reburial of her father, Thutmose I, in [[KV20]] (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)]]
Carter, however, also discovered 2 separate coffins in the burial chamber. The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut "was discovered open with no sign of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor;" it is now housed in the Cairo Museum along with a matching yellow quartzite [[canopic chest]].<ref name="Tyldesley, p.124"/> A second sarcophagus, was found lying on its side with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall nearby; it was eventually presented to [[Theodore M. Davis]], the excavation's financial sponsor as a gesture of appreciation for his generous financial support.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.124">Tyldesley, p.124</ref> Davis would, in turn, present it to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston. The second quartzite sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of "'''the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut'''."<ref name="Tyldesley, p.124"/> However, when the sarcophagus was complete, Hatshepsut decided to commission an entirely new sarcophagus for herself while she donated the existing finished sarcophagus to her father, Thutmose I.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.124"/> The stonemasons then attempted to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Tuthmose I instead. This quartzite sarcophagus measures 7 feet long by 3 feet wide with walls 5&nbsp;inches thick and bears a dedication text which records Hatshepsut's generosity towards her father:
{{cquote|...long live the Female Horus...The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, the son of Re, Hatshepsut-Khnemet-Amun! May she live forever! She made it as her monument to her father whom she loved, the Good God, Lord of the [[Two Lands]], Aakheperkare, the son of Re, Thutmosis the [[plinth (hieroglyph)#Plinth use as mortuary: "Justified"|justified]].<ref>Tyldesley, p.125</ref>}}

Thutmose I was, however, not destined to lie alongside his daughter after Hatshepsut's death. Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, decided to reinter his grandfather in an even more magnificent tomb, [[KV38]], which featured another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I and inscribed with texts which proclaimed this pharaoh's love for his deceased grandfather.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.126">Tyldesley, p.126</ref> Unfortunately, however, Thutmose I's remains would be disturbed late during the 20th dynasty when [[KV38]] was plundered; the sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and [[grave goods]] were stolen.<ref name="Tyldesley, p.126"/>

Thutmose I's mummy was ultimately discovered in the [[Deir el-Bahri]] [[DB320|Cache]] above the [[mortuary temple|Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut]], revealed in 1881. He had been interred along with those of other 18th and 19th dynasty leaders [[Ahmose I]], [[Amenhotep I]], [[Thutmose II]], [[Thutmose III]], [[Ramesses I]], [[Seti I]], [[Ramesses II]], and [[Ramesses IX]], as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs [[Pinedjem I]], [[Pinedjem II]], and [[Siamun]].

The original coffin of Thutmose I was taken over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I was thought to be lost, but Egyptologist [[Gaston Maspero]], largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283.<ref name="Maspero">Maspero, Gaston.  ''History Of Egypt, Chaldaea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 4 (of 12),'' Project Gutenberg EBook, Release Date: December 16, 2005. EBook #17324. http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/7/3/2/17324/17324-h/v4c.htm#image-0047</ref> This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made during the course of the Eighteenth dynasty.<ref>Smith (2000) p.25-28</ref>

Gaston Maspero described the mummy in the following manner:
:''The king was already advanced in age at the time of his death, being over fifty years old, to judge by the incisor teeth, which are worn and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full. The body, though small and emaciated, shows evidence of unusual muscular strength; the head is bald, the features are refined, and the mouth still bears an expression characteristic of shrewdness and cunning.''<ref name="Maspero"/>

What has been thought to be his mummy can be viewed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]]. However, in 2007, [[Zahi Hawass|Dr. Zahi Hawass]] announced that the mummy which was previously thought to be Thutmose I [is] that of a thirty year old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it was determined that the mummy was probably not that of King Thutmose I himself.<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Anderson  | first =  Lisa   | authorlink =   | title = Mummy awakens new era in Egypt  | newspaper =  Chicago Tribune  | pages =   | date = 14 July 2007  | url = http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&id=7226  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>
