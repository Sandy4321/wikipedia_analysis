'''Huldrych''' (or '''Ulrich''')<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=1}}. According to Potter, "Huldrych" was the spelling Zwingli preferred. However, Potter uses "Ulrich", while G<U+00E4>bler, Stephens, and Furcha uses "Huldrych". His signature at the Marburg Colloquy was the [[Latinised]] name "Huldrychus Zwinglius" ({{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}). For more on his name, see {{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-03-03}} (in German only, Reformed Church of Z<U+00FC>rich)</ref> '''Zwingli''' ([[1 January]] [[1484]] &ndash; [[11 October]] [[1531]]) was a leader of the [[Reformation in Switzerland]]. Born during a time of rising Swiss patriotism and increasing criticism of the [[Swiss mercenaries|Swiss mercenary system]], he attended the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Basel]], a scholarly centre of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]]. He continued his studies while he served as a pastor in [[Glarus]] and later in [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] where he was influenced by the writings of [[Erasmus]]. 

In 1519, Zwingli became the pastor of the [[Grossm<U+00FC>nster]] in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] where he began to preach ideas on reforming the Church. In his first public controversy in 1522, he attacked the [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|custom of fasting]] during [[Lent]]. In his publications, he noted corruption in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, promoted clerical marriage, and attacked the use of [[Icons|images]] in places of worship. In 1525, Zwingli introduced a new [[Eucharist|communion]] [[liturgy]] to replace the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]]. Zwingli also clashed with the radical wing of the Reformation, the [[Anabaptists]], which resulted in their persecution.

The Reformation spread to other parts of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]], but several [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] resisted, preferring to remain [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Zwingli formed an alliance of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli<U+2019>s ideas came to the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and other reformers. They met at the [[Marburg Colloquy]] and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the [[Real Presence|presence of Christ]] in the [[Eucharist]]. 

In 1531 Zwingli<U+2019>s alliance applied an unsuccessful food blockade on the Catholic cantons. The cantons responded with an attack at a moment when Z<U+00FC>rich was badly prepared. Zwingli was killed in battle at the age of 47. His legacy lives on in the [[Reformed Christian confessions of faith|confessions]], liturgy, and church orders of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.

==Historical context==
[[Image:Historische Karte CH 1515.png|thumb|right|260px|Map of the Swiss Confederation in 1515.]]
The [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederation]] in Huldrych Zwingli<U+2019>s time consisted of thirteen states ([[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]) as well as affiliated states and common lordships. Unlike the current modern state of [[Switzerland]], which operates under a federal government, the thirteen states were nearly independent, conducting their own domestic and foreign affairs. Each state formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis for conflict during the time of the Reformation when the various states divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions were given an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen, for example, in the [[Old Z<U+00FC>rich War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=1<U+2013>4}}</ref>

The political environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries the foreign policies of the Confederation were determined by its relationship with its powerful neighbour, France. Nominally, the Confederation was under the control of another major power, the [[House of Habsburg]] (Austria) and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the [[Swabian War]], the Confederation had become ''de facto'' independent. As the two continental powers and minor states such as the [[Duchy of Milan]], [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Papal States]] competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and social consequences for the Confederation. It was during this time that the [[Swiss mercenaries|mercenary pension system]] became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli<U+2019>s time debated vociferously regarding the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=4<U+2013>6}}</ref>

These internal and external factors contributed to the rise of a Confederation national consciousness, in which the term ''fatherland'' (''patria'') began to take on meaning beyond an individual canton. At the same time, [[Renaissance humanism]], with its universal values and emphasis on scholarship (as exemplified by [[Erasmus]], the "prince of humanism"), had taken root in the country. It was within this environment, defined by the confluence of Swiss patriotism and humanism, that Zwingli was born.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=6<U+2013>7}}</ref>

==Life==
===Early years (1484&ndash;1518)===
[[Image:Geburtshaus von Huldrych Zwingli.jpg|thumb|right|260px|House where Zwingli was born in [[Wildhaus]] in what is now the [[Canton of St. Gallen]].]]
Huldrych Zwingli was born on [[1 January]] [[1484]] in [[Wildhaus]], [[Switzerland]] in the [[Toggenburg]] valley to a family of farmers, the third child among nine siblings. His father, Ulrich, played a leading role in the administration of the community (''Amtmann'' or chief local magistrate).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=6}}</ref> Zwingli's primary schooling was provided by his uncle, Bartholomew, a cleric in [[Weesen]]. At ten years old, Zwingli was sent to [[Basel]] to obtain his secondary education where he learned Latin under Magistrate Gregory B<U+00FC>nzli. After three years in Basel, he stayed a short time in [[Bern]] with the humanist, Henry W<U+00F6>lfflin. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in Bern tried to persuade Zwingli to join their order and it is possible that he was received as a novice.<ref name=G<U+00E4>bler24Potter9>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}. Potter mentions this possibility. G<U+00E4>bler states that Zwingli did not refute later claims by opponents that he had been a monk in Bern.</ref> However, his father and uncle disapproved of such a course and he left Bern without completing his Latin studies.<ref name=G<U+00E4>bler24Potter9>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=24}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=9}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]] in the winter semester of 1498 but was expelled, according to the university's records.   However, it is not certain that Zwingli was indeed expelled, and he re-enrolled in the summer semester of 1500; his activities in 1499 are unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=25}}. The word ''exclusus'' (expelled) was added to his matriculation entry. G<U+00E4>bler notes that without a date and reason, it does not conform to what was customary at the time.</ref> Zwingli continued his studies in Vienna until 1502, after which he transferred to the [[University of Basel]] where he received the Master of Arts degree (''Magister'') in 1506.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=26}}</ref>

Like many of his contemporaries, Zwingli went to work for the Church having studied little theology. He celebrated his first [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in his hometown, Wildhaus, on [[29 September]] [[1506]]. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of [[Glarus]], where he stayed for ten years.  It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly on the side of the [[Holy See|Roman See]]. In return, [[Pope Julius II]] honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]] in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the [[Battle of Marignano]] caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to [[Einsiedeln, Switzerland|Einsiedeln]] in the [[canton of Schwyz]]. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as ''The Ox'' (1510) and ''The Labyrinth'' (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=8}}; {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=35, 37}}</ref> Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=29<U+2013>33}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=22<U+2013>40}}</ref>

Zwingli's time as the pastor of Glarus and Einsiedeln was characterised by inner growth and development. He perfected his [[Greek language|Greek]] and he took up the study of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. His library contained over three hundred volumes from which he was able to draw upon [[Classics|classical]], [[patristic]], and [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] works.  He exchanged scholarly letters with a circle of Swiss humanists and began to study the writings of Erasmus. Zwingli took the opportunity to meet him while Erasmus was in Basel between August 1514 and May 1516. Zwingli's turn to relative [[pacifism]] and his focus on preaching can be traced to the influence of Erasmus.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=33<U+2013>41}}</ref>

In late 1518, the post of the ''Leutpriestertum'' (people's priest) of the [[Grossm<U+00FC>nster]] at [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] became vacant. The [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the foundation that administered the Grossm<U+00FC>nster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, his opposition to the French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Z<U+00FC>rich politicians.  On [[11 December]] [[1518]], the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on [[27 December]] he moved permanently to Z<U+00FC>rich.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=43<U+2013>44}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=45<U+2013>46}}</ref>

===Z<U+00FC>rich ministry begins (1519&ndash;1521)===
[[Image:Prozessionsachse murerplan.jpg|thumb|left|The Grossm<U+00FC>nster in the centre of the medieval town of Z<U+00FC>rich ([[Murerplan]], 1576)]]
On [[1 January]] [[1519]], Zwingli gave his first sermon in Z<U+00FC>rich. Deviating from the prevalent practice of basing a sermon on the Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, he began to read through the [[Gospel of Matthew]] giving his interpretation or [[exegesis]] during the sermon. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays until he reached the end and then proceeded in the same manner with the [[Acts of the Apostles]], the New Testament [[epistles]], and finally the Old Testament. His motives for doing this are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor [[Lutheran]]. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=44<U+2013>45}}</ref> One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Oskar Farner and Walther K<U+00F6>hler.</ref> Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=46}}. Proponents of this view are Arthur Rich and Cornelius Augustijn.</ref> A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=46-47}}. A proponent of this view is Gottfried W. Locher.</ref>

Zwingli<U+2019>s theological stance was gradually revealed through his sermons. He attacked moral corruption and in the process he named individuals who were the targets of his denunciations. Monks were accused of indolence and high living. In 1519, Zwingli specifically rejected the [[veneration]] of saints and called for the need to distinguish between their true and fictional accounts. He cast doubts on hellfire, asserted that unbaptised children were not damned, and questioned the power of [[excommunication]]. His attack on the claim that [[Tithe|tithing]] was a divine institution, however, had the greatest theological and social impact. This contradicted the immediate economic interests of the foundation. One of the elderly canons who had supported Zwingli<U+2019>s election, Konrad Hofmann, complained about his sermons in a letter. Some canons supported Hofmann, but the opposition never grew very large. Zwingli insisted that he was not an innovator and that the [[Sola scriptura|sole basis of his teachings was Scripture]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=49<U+2013>52}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=66}}</ref> 

Within the [[Bishopric of Constance|diocese of Constance]], Bernhardin Sanson was offering a special [[indulgence]] for contributors to the building of [[St. Peter<U+2019>s Basilica|St Peter<U+2019>s]] in Rome. When Sanson arrived at the gates of Z<U+00FC>rich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after [[Martin Luther]] published his [[Ninety-five theses]] ([[31 October]] [[1517]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=XII}}</ref> The council of Z<U+00FC>rich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain the fire started by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=44, 66<U+2013>67}}</ref>

In August 1519, Z<U+00FC>rich was struck by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] during which at least one in four persons died. All of those who could afford it left the city, but Zwingli remained and continued his pastoral duties. In September, he caught the disease and nearly died. He described his preparation for death in a poem, Zwingli's ''Pestlied'', consisting of three parts: the onset of the illness, the closeness to death, and the joy of recovery.  The final verses of the first part read:<ref>see e.g. {{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=69<U+2013>70}}</ref>

In the years following his recovery, Zwingli's opponents remained in the minority. When a vacancy occurred among the canons of the Grossm<U+00FC>nster, Zwingli was elected to fulfill that vacancy on [[29 April]] [[1521]].  In becoming a canon, he became a full citizen of Z<U+00FC>rich. He also retained his post as the people's priest of the Grossm<U+00FC>nster.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=51}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=73}}</ref>

===First rifts (1522&ndash;1524)===
[[Image:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A rendition of Huldrych Zwingli from the 1906 edition of the [[Meyers Konversations-Lexikon]]]]

The first public controversy regarding Zwingli<U+2019>s preaching broke out during the season of [[Lent]] in 1522. On the first fasting Sunday, [[9 March]], Zwingli and about a dozen other participants consciously transgressed the fasting rule by cutting and distributing two smoked sausages (the ''Wurstessen'' in [[Christoph Froschauer]]'s workshop). Zwingli defended this act in a sermon which was published on [[16 April]], under the title ''Von Erkiesen und Freiheit der Speisen'' (Regarding the Choice and Freedom of Foods). He noted that no general valid rule on food can be derived from the Bible and that to transgress such a rule is not a sin and thus not punishable by the Church. Even before the publication of this treatise, the diocese of Constance reacted by sending a delegation to Z<U+00FC>rich. The city council condemned the fasting violation, but assumed responsibility over ecclesiastical matters and requested the religious authorities clarify the issue. The bishop responded on [[24 May]] by admonishing the Grossm<U+00FC>nster and city council and repeating the traditional position.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=52<U+2013>56}}</ref>

Following this event, Zwingli and other humanist friends petitioned the bishop on [[2 July]] to abolish the requirement of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as ''Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen'' (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on [[2 April]] [[1524]], three months before the birth of their first child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=80}}</ref> They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded at the same level by notifying the Z<U+00FC>rich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergyman joined in Zwingli<U+2019>s cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, ''Apolgeticus Archeteles'' (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=57<U+2013>59}}</ref>

===Z<U+00FC>rich disputations (1523)===
[[Image:Switzerland Z<U+00FC>rich Grossm<U+00FC>nster Zwingli M<U+00FC>nch 1935.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Relief]] of Zwingli preaching at the pulpit, [[Otto M<U+00FC>nch]], 1935]]
The events of 1522 brought no clarification on the issues. Not only did the unrest between Z<U+00FC>rich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Z<U+00FC>rich<U+2019>s Confederation partners in the [[Tagsatzung|Swiss Diet]]. On [[22 December]], the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Z<U+00FC>rich. The city council felt obliged to take the initiative and to find its own solution. On [[3 January]] [[1523]], it invited the clergy of the city and outlying region to a meeting to allow the factions to present their opinions. The bishop was invited to attend or to send a representative. The council would render a decision on who would be allowed to continue to proclaim their views. This meeting, the first Z<U+00FC>rich disputation, took place on [[29 January]] [[1523]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=63<U+2013>65}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=97<U+2013>100}}</ref>

The meeting attracted a large crowd of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his [[vicar general]], Johannes Fabri. Zwingli summarised his position in the ''Schlussreden'' (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles).<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=99}}</ref> Fabri, who was ordered not to participate but to observe only, simply insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli would be allowed to continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=67<U+2013>71}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=100<U+2013>104}}</ref>

In September 1523, [[Leo Jud]], Zwingli<U+2019>s closest friend and colleague and pastor of [[St. Peter, Z<U+00FC>rich|St. Peterskirche]], publicly called for the removal of statues of saints and other icons. This led to demonstrations and [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] activities. The city council decided to work out the matter of images in a second disputation. The essence of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] and its sacrificial character was also included as a subject of discussion. Supporters of the mass claimed that the Eucharist was a true sacrifice, while Zwingli claimed that it was a commemorative meal. As in the first disputation, an invitation was sent out to the Z<U+00FC>rich clergy and the bishop of Constance. This time, however, the lay people of Z<U+00FC>rich, the dioceses of [[Chur]] and Basel, the University of Basel, and the twelve members of the Confederation were also invited. About nine hundred persons attended this meeting, but neither the bishop nor the Confederation sent representatives. The disputation started on [[26 October]] [[1523]] and lasted two days.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=72, 76<U+2013>77}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=130<U+2013>131}}</ref>

Zwingli again took the lead in the disputation and his opponent was the canon mentioned above, Konrad Hofmann, who had initially supported Zwingli's election. Also taking part was a radical wing of the Reformation who demanded much faster action. This group was led by [[Conrad Grebel]] who would eventually found the [[Anabaptist]] movement, a group that placed particular importance on [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]] and the rejection of [[infant baptism]]. During the first three days, although the controversy of images and the mass were discussed, the arguments led to the question of whether the city council or the ecclesiastical government had the authority to decide on these issues. At this point, Konrad Schmid, a priest from [[Aargau]] and a follower of Zwingli, made a pragmatic suggestion. As images were not yet considered to be valueless by everyone, he suggested that pastors preach on this subject under threat of punishment. He believed the opinions of the people would gradually change and the voluntary removal of images would follow. Hence, Schmid rejected the radicals and their iconoclasm, but supported Zwingli<U+2019>s position. In November the council passed ordinances in support of Schmid<U+2019>s motion. Zwingli wrote a booklet on the evangelical duties of a minister, ''Kurze, christliche Einleitung'' (Short Christian Introduction), and the council sent it out to the clergy and the members of the Confederation.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=78<U+2013>81}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=131<U+2013>135}}</ref>

===Reformation progresses in Z<U+00FC>rich (1524&ndash;1525)===
[[Image:Zue Grossmuenster 06.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Above the entrance to the Grossm<U+00FC>nster, it is written, "In this House of God, Huldrych Zwingli's Reformation took its start."]]
In December 1523, the council set a deadline of [[Pentecost]] in 1524 for a solution to the elimination of the mass and images. Zwingli gave a formal opinion in ''Vorschlag wegen der Bilder und der Messe'' (Proposal Concerning Images and the Mass). He did not urge an immediate, general abolition. The council decided on the orderly removal of images within Z<U+00FC>rich, but rural congregations were granted the right to remove them based on majority vote. The decision on the mass was postponed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=81<U+2013>82}}</ref>

Evidence of the effect of the Reformation was seen in early 1524. [[Candlemas]] was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on [[Palm Sunday]] to the [[Lindenhof]], and [[Triptych|triptychs]] remained covered and closed after [[Lent]].<ref name="Potter138">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council and the result was the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=82<U+2013>83}}</ref>

Although the council had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the decrease in the exercise of traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation by designing a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in ''Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls'' (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before [[Easter]], Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On [[Maundy Thursday]], [[13 April]] [[1525]], Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was the focal point of the service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli<U+2019>s proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref>

For some time Zwingli had accused [[mendicant]] orders of hypocrisy and demanded their abolition in order to support the truly poor. He suggested the monasteries be changed into hospitals and welfare institutions and incorporate their wealth into a welfare fund. This was done by reorganising the foundations of the Grossm<U+00FC>nster and [[Fraum<U+00FC>nster]] and pensioning off remaining nuns and monks. The council secularised the church properties and established new welfare programs for the poor. Zwingli requested permission to establish a Latin school, the ''Prophezei'' (Prophecy), at the Grossm<U+00FC>nster. The council agreed and it was officially opened on [[19 June]] [[1525]] with Zwingli and Jud as teachers. It served to retrain and re-educate the clergy. The [[Z<U+00FC>rich Bible]] translation, traditionally attributed to Zwingli and printed by [[Christoph Froschauer]], bears the mark of teamwork from the Prophecy school.<ref>According to {{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=102}}, the first complete Bible was printed in 1531.

===Conflict with the Anabaptists  (1525&ndash;1527)===
Shortly after the second Z<U+00FC>rich disputation, many in the radical wing of the Reformation became convinced that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Z<U+00FC>rich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. [[Conrad Grebel]], the leader of the radicals and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On [[15 August]] [[1524]] the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel<U+2019>s group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published ''Wer Unsache gebe zu Aufruhr'' (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing point-of-views.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=125<U+2013>126}}</ref> On [[17 January]] [[1525]] a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Z<U+00FC>rich. The radicals ignored these measures and on [[21 January]], they met at the house of the mother of another radical leader, [[Felix Manz]]. Grebel and a third leader, [[George Blaurock]], performed the first recorded Anabaptist [[Credobaptism|adult baptisms]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=177<U+2013>182}}</ref>

On [[1 February]], the council repeated the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some who failed to comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Z<U+00FC>rich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread to other parts of the Confederation as well as a number of [[Swabia|Swabian]] towns. On 6<U+2013>8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossm<U+00FC>nster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious exchange of views as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=183<U+2013>186}}</ref>

The Z<U+00FC>rich council decided that no compromise was possible. On [[7 March]] [[1526]] it released the notorious mandate that no one shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=187}}</ref> Although Zwingli, technically, had nothing to do with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Z<U+00FC>rich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on [[5 January]] [[1527]] by being drowned in the [[Limmat]] river. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Z<U+00FC>rich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=186<U+2013>188}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

===Reformation in the Confederation (1526&ndash;1528)===
{{see|Swiss Reformation}}
[[Image:Zwingli statue.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Statue of Zwingli in front of the [[Wasserkirche]] in Z<U+00FC>rich]]
On [[8 April]] [[1524]], five cantons, [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], formed an alliance, ''die f<U+00FC>nf Orte'' (the Five States) to defend themselves from Zwingli<U+2019>s Reformation.<ref name="Potter138">{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=138}}</ref> They contacted the opponents of Martin Luther including [[John Eck]] who had debated Luther in [[Leipzig]] in 1519. Eck offered to dispute Zwingli and he accepted. However, they could not agree on the selection of the judging authority, the location of the debate, and the use of the Swiss Diet as a court. Because of the disagreements, Zwingli decided to boycott the disputation. On [[19 May]] [[1526]], all the cantons sent delegates to [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]. Although Z<U+00FC>rich<U+2019>s representatives were present, they did not participate in the sessions. Eck led the Catholic party while the reformers were represented by [[Johannes Oecolampadius]] of Basel, a theologian from [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] who had carried on an extensive and friendly correspondence with Zwingli. While the debate proceeded, Zwingli was kept informed of the proceedings and printed pamphlets giving his opinions. It was of little use as the Diet decided against Zwingli. He was to be banned and his writings were no longer to be distributed. Of the thirteen Confederation members, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Appenzell]] as well as the Five States voted against Zwingli. [[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Basel|Basel]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], and [[Canton of Z<U+00FC>rich|Z<U+00FC>rich]] supported him.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=111<U+2013>113}}</ref> 

The Baden disputation exposed a deep rift in the Confederation on matters of religion. The Reformation was now emerging in other states. The city of [[St Gallen]], an affiliated state to the Confederation, was led by a reformed mayor, [[Joachim Vadian]], and the city abolished the mass in 1527, just two years after Z<U+00FC>rich. In Basel, although Zwingli had a close relationship with Oecolampadius, the government did not officially sanction any reformatory changes until [[1 April]] [[1529]] when the mass was prohibited. Schaffhausen, which had closely followed Z<U+00FC>rich<U+2019>s example, formally adopted the Reformation in September 1529. In the case of Bern, [[Berchtold Haller]], the priest at [[M<U+00FC>nster of Berne|St Vincent M<U+00FC>nster]], and [[Niklaus Manuel]], the poet, painter, and politician, had campaigned for the reformed cause. But it was only after another disputation that Bern counted itself as a canton of the Reformation. Four hundred and fifty persons participated, including pastors from Bern and other cantons as well as theologians from outside the Confederation such as [[Martin Bucer]] and [[Wolfgang Capito]] from [[Strasbourg]], [[Ambrosius Blarer]] from [[Konstanz|Constance]], and [[Andreas Althamer]] from [[N<U+00FC>rnberg]]. Eck and Fabri refused to attend and the Catholic cantons did not send representatives. The meeting started on [[6 January]] [[1528]] and lasted nearly three weeks. Zwingli assumed the main burden of defending the Reformation and he preached twice in the M<U+00FC>nster. On [[7 February]] [[1528]] the council decreed that the Reformation was established in Bern.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=113<U+2013>119}}</ref>

===First Kappel War (1529)===
{{See|First war of Kappel}}
Even before the Bern disputation, Zwingli was canvassing for an alliance of reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, ''das Christliche Burgrecht'' (the Christian Civic Union) was created.<ref>{{Harvnb|Locher|1981|p=109}}. Potter also translates ''Burgrecht'' as "Civic Union", while {{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=119}} translates it as "Fortress Law".</ref> The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Z<U+00FC>rich on 5<U+2013>6 January 1528. Other cities including Basel, [[Biel]], [[M<U+00FC>lhausen]], Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five States felt encircled and isolated, so they searched for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed ''die Christliche Vereinigung'' (the Christian Alliance) with [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Austria]] on [[22 April]] [[1529]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=119<U+2013>120}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=352<U+2013>355}}</ref>

Soon after the Austrian treaty was signed, a reformed preacher, Jacob Kaiser, was captured in [[Uznach]] and executed in Schwyz. This triggered a strong reaction from Zwingli, and he drafted ''Ratschlag <U+00FC>ber den Krieg'' (Advice About the War) for the government. He outlined justifications for an attack on the Catholic states and other measures to be taken. Before Z<U+00FC>rich could implement his plans, a delegation from Bern that included Niklaus Manuel, arrived in Z<U+00FC>rich. The delegation called on Z<U+00FC>rich to settle the matter peacefully. Manuel added that an attack would expose Bern to further dangers as Catholic [[Valais]] and the Duchy of Savoy bordered its southern flank. He then noted, "You cannot really bring faith by means of spears and halberds."<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=364}}. In [[Early Modern German]], "Warlich man mag mit spiess und halberten den glouben nit ingeben."</ref> Z<U+00FC>rich, however, decided that it would act alone knowing that Bern would be obliged to acquiesce. War was declared on [[8 June]] [[1529]]. Z<U+00FC>rich was able to raise an army of 30,000 men. The Five States were abandoned by Austria and could raise only 9,000 men. The two forces met near [[Kappel am Albis|Kappel]], but war was averted due to the intervention of Hans Aebli, a relative of Zwingli, who pleaded for an armistice.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=120<U+2013>121}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=362<U+2013>367}}</ref>

Zwingli was obliged to state the terms of the armistice. He demanded the dissolution of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching of the Bible in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not ready to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Z<U+00FC>rich and Bern could not agree and the Five States pledged only to the dissolution of the alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=367<U+2013>369}}</ref> The first Land Peace of Kappel, ''der erste Landfriede'', ended the war on [[24 June]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=371}}</ref>

===Marburg Colloquy (1529)===
[[Image:Marburger-Religionsgespr<U+00E4>ch.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Wood carving of the Marburg Colloquy, anonymous, 1557]]
While Zwingli carried on the political work of the Swiss Reformation, he developed his theological views with his colleagues. The famous disagreement between Luther and Zwingli on the interpretation of the [[Eucharist]] originated when [[Andreas Karlstadt]], Luther<U+2019>s former colleague from [[Wittenberg]], published three pamphlets on the Lord<U+2019>s Supper in which Karlstadt rejected the idea of a [[real presence]] in the elements. These pamphlets, published in Basel in 1524, received the approval of Oecolampadius and Zwingli. Luther rejected Karlstadt<U+2019>s arguments and considered Zwingli primarily to be a partisan of Karlstadt. Zwingli began to express his thoughts on the Eucharist in several publications including ''de Eucharistia'' (On the Eucharist). He attacked the idea of the real presence and argued that the word ''is'' in the [[Words of Institution|words of the institution]]&mdash;"This is my body, this is my blood"&mdash;means ''signifies''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=157}}</ref> Hence, the words are understood as a metaphor and Zwingli claimed that there was no real presence during the Eucharist. In effect, the meal was symbolic of the [[Last Supper]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=131<U+2013>135}}</ref>

By spring 1527, Luther reacted strongly to Zwingli<U+2019>s views in a treatise placing his disagreement with Zwingli in the context of a battle against Satanic forces. The controversy continued until 1528 when efforts to build bridges between the Lutheran and the Zwinglian views began. Martin Bucer tried to mediate while [[Philip of Hesse]], who wanted to form a political coalition of all Protestant forces, invited the two parties to [[Marburg]] to discuss their differences. This event became known as the [[Marburg Colloquy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref>

Zwingli accepted Philip's invitation fully believing that he would be able to convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on [[28 September]] [[1529]] with Luther and [[Philipp Melanchthon]] arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, [[Andreas Osiander]], [[Johannes Brenz]], and [[Justus Jonas]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bainton|1995|p=251}}</ref> The debates were held from 1<U+2013>3 October and the results were published in the fifteen ''Marburg Articles''. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=136<U+2013>138}}</ref>

===Politics, confessions, and the Second Kappel War (1529&ndash;1531)===
{{See|Second war of Kappel}}
With the failure of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an alliance with [[Philip of Hesse]]. He kept a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a long process, Z<U+00FC>rich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States. Approaches to Venice and Milan also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=141<U+2013>143}}</ref>

As Zwingli was working on establishing these political alliances, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the Holy Roman Emperor, invited Protestants to the [[Augsburg Diet]] to present their views so that he could make a verdict on the issue of faith. The Lutherans presented the [[Augsburg Confession]]. Under the leadership of Martin Bucer, the cities of Strasbourg, Constance, [[Memmingen]], and [[Lindau]] produced the [[Tetrapolitan Confession]]. This document attempted to take a middle position between the Lutherans and Zwinglians. It was too late for the ''Burgrecht'' cities to produce a confession of their own. Zwingli then produced his own private confession, ''Fidei ratio'' (Account of Faith) in which he explained his faith in twelve articles conforming to the articles of the [[Apostles' Creed]]. The tone was strongly anti-Catholic as well as anti-Lutheran. The Lutherans did not react officially, but criticised it privately. Zwingli's and Luther's old opponent, John Eck, counter-attacked with a publication, ''Refutation of the Articles Zwingli Submitted to the Emperor''.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=143<U+2013>146}}</ref>

When Philip of Hesse formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] at the end of 1530, the four cities of the Tetrapolitan Confession joined on the basis of a Lutheran interpretation of that confession. Given the flexibility of the league's entrance requirements, Z<U+00FC>rich, Basel, and Bern also considered joining. However, Zwingli could not reconcile the Tetrapolitan Confession with his own beliefs and wrote a harsh refusal to Bucer and Capito. This offended Philip to the point where relations with the League were severed. The ''Burgrecht'' cities now had no external allies to help deal with internal Confederation religious conflicts.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=148}}</ref>

[[Image:Schlacht bei Kappel.jpg|right|thumb|320px|The [[Second war of Kappel|Battle of Kappel]], [[11 October]][[1531]], from ''Chronik'' by [[Johann Stumpf (writer)|Johannes Stumpf]], 1548]]
The peace treaty of the First Kappel War did not define the right of unhindered preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The ''Burgrecht'' cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred quiet diplomacy while Z<U+00FC>rich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated an attack on the Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Z<U+00FC>rich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Z<U+00FC>rich urged its continuation and the ''Burgrecht'' cities began to quarrel among themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=148<U+2013>150}}</ref>

On [[9 October]] [[1531]], in a surprise move, the Five States declared war on Z<U+00FC>rich. Z<U+00FC>rich's mobilisation was slow due to internal squabbling and on [[11 October]], three thousand five hundred poorly deployed men encountered a Five States force nearly double their size near Kappel. Many pastors, including Zwingli, were among the soldiers. The battle lasted less than one hour and Zwingli was among the five hundred casualties in the Z<U+00FC>rich army.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=150<U+2013>152}}</ref> He had considered himself first and foremost a soldier of Christ; second a defender of his country, the Confederation; and third a leader of his city, Z<U+00FC>rich, where he lived the last twelve years. Ironically, he died at the age of 47, not for Christ nor for the Confederation, but for Z<U+00FC>rich.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=414}}</ref>

==Theology==
{{See|Theology of Huldrych Zwingli}}
The cornerstone of Zwingli<U+2019>s theology is the Bible. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the [[ecumenical councils]] or the [[Church Fathers]], although he did not hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=51<U+2013>52}}</ref> The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his humanist education and his reformed understanding of the Bible.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=59}}</ref> Modifying a literalist interpretation of a passage, he paid attention to the immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it. He compared passages of scripture and used analogies, a method he describes in ''A Friendly Exegesis'' (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and [[circumcision]] and between the [[Passover]] and the Eucharist.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=64<U+2013>66}}</ref>

Zwingli rejected the word ''sacrament'' in the popular usage of his time. For ordinary people, the word meant some kind of holy action of which there is inherent power to free the conscience from sin. For Zwingli, a sacrament was an initiatory ceremony or a pledge, pointing out that the word was derived from ''sacramentum'' meaning an oath.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=180<U+2013>185}}</ref> In his early writings on baptism, he noted that baptism was an example of such a pledge. He challenged Catholics by accusing them of superstition when they ascribed the water of baptism a certain power to wash away sin. Later, in his conflict with the Anabaptists, he defended the practice of infant baptism, noting that there is no law forbidding the practice. He argued that baptism was a sign of our covenant with God, thereby replacing circumcision in the Old Testament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=194<U+2013>206}}</ref>

Zwingli approached the Eucharist in a similar manner to baptism. During the first Z<U+00FC>rich disputation in 1523, he denied that an actual sacrifice occurred during the mass, arguing that Christ made the sacrifice only once and for all eternity. Hence, the Eucharist was only <U+201C>a memorial of the sacrifice<U+201D>.<ref>''Huldreich Zwinglis Samtliche Werke'', Vol. I, 460.6-10, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=219}}</ref> Following this argument, he further developed his view, coming to the conclusion of the <U+201C>signifies<U+201D> interpretation for the words of the institution. He used various passages of scripture to argue against [[transubstantiation]] as well as Luther<U+2019>s views, the key text being John 6:63, "It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh is of no avail". Zwingli<U+2019>s rational approach and use of scripture to understand the meaning of the Eucharist was one reason he could not reach a consensus with Luther.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=218<U+2013>250}}</ref>

The impact of Luther on Zwingli<U+2019>s theological development has long been a source of interest and discussion among Zwinglian scholars. Zwingli himself asserted vigourously his independence of Luther. The most recent studies have confirmed this. Zwingli appeared to have read Luther<U+2019>s books rather hastily, searching for confirmation from Luther for his own views. Zwingli did, however, admire Luther greatly for the stand he took against the pope.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|p=22}}</ref> His later writings continued to show characteristic differences from Luther such as the inclusion of non-Christians in heaven as described in ''An Exposition of the Faith''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stephens|1986|pp=49-49}}</ref>

==Music==
Zwingli enjoyed music and could play several instruments, including the violin, harp, flute, dulcimer and hunting horn. He would sometimes amuse the children of his congregation on his lute and was so well-known for his playing that his enemies mocked him as <U+201C>the evangelical lute-player and fifer".  <!-- Aber der gute Zwingli pfiff darauf. ;) --> Three of Zwingli's ''[[Lied]]er'' or hymns have been preserved: the ''Pestlied'' mentioned above, an adaptation of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 65 (ca. 1525), and the ''Kappeler Lied'', which is believed to have been composed during the campaign of the first war of Kappel (1529).<ref>Hannes Reimann, ''Huldrych Zwingli - der Musiker'', Archiv f<U+00FC>r Musikwissenschaft 17 2./3. (1960), pp. 126<U+2013>141</ref>  However, these songs were not meant to be sung during worship services and are not identified as hymns of the Reformation, although they were published in some 16th-century hymnals.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=108}}</ref>

Zwingli criticised the practice of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people<U+2019>s attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches.  Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=107<U+2013>108}}</ref> Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the Church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, "The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer.... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs".  Locher goes on to say that "Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing.  In addition, he even seems to have striven for lively, antiphonal, unison recitative". Locher then summaries his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows:  "The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding' <U+2014> 'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned".<ref name="zwinglis thought">{{Harvnb|Locher|1981}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{Calvinism}}
Zwingli was a humanist and a scholar with many devoted friends and disciples. He communicated as easily with the ordinary people of his congregation as with rulers such as [[Philip of Hesse]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|pp=417<U+2013>418}}</ref> His reputation as a stern, stolid reformer is counterbalanced by the fact that he had an excellent sense of humour and he used satiric fables, spoofing, and puns in his writings.<ref>{{Citation

 }}.</ref> He was more conscious of social obligations than Luther and he genuinely believed that the masses would accept a government guided by God<U+2019>s word.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1976|p=418}}</ref> He tirelessly promoted assistance to the poor, who he believed should be cared for by a truly Christian community.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wandel|1990|p=45}}</ref> 

In December 1531, the Z<U+00FC>rich council selected [[Heinrich Bullinger]] as his successor. He immediately removed any doubts about Zwingli<U+2019>s orthodoxy and defended him as a prophet and a martyr. Under Bullinger, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=157<U+2013>158}}</ref> He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them to recover from the defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steinmetz|2001|p=98}}</ref> 

Scholars have found assessing Zwingli<U+2019>s historical impact to be difficult, for several reasons.  There is no consensus definition of "Zwinglianism"; by any definition, Zwinglianism evolved under his successor, Heinrich Bullinger; and research into Zwingli<U+2019>s influence on Bullinger and [[John Calvin]] is still rudimentary.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=155<U+2013>156}}</ref> Bullinger adopted most of Zwingli<U+2019>s points of doctrine. Like Zwingli, he summarised his theology several times, the most well-known being the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] of 1566. Meanwhile, Calvin had established the Reformation in [[Geneva]]. Calvin differed with Zwingli on the Eucharist and criticised him for regarding it as simply a metaphorical event. In 1549, however, Bullinger and Calvin succeeded in overcoming the differences in doctrine and produced the ''Consensus Tigurinus'' (Z<U+00FC>rich Consensus). They declared that the Eucharist was not just symbolic of the meal, but they also rejected the Lutheran position that the body and blood of Christ is in [[Sacramental union|union with the elements]]. With this rapprochement, Calvin established his role in the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed Churches]] and eventually in the wider world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp=179<U+2013>195}}, J. C. McLelland, "Meta-Zwingli or Anti-Zwingli? Bullinger and Calvin in Eucharistic Concord"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|pp=158<U+2013>159}}</ref>

Outside of Switzerland, no church counts Zwingli as its founder. Scholars speculate as to why Zwinglianism has not diffused more widely.<ref>{{Harvnb|Furcha|1985|pp=1<U+2013>12}}, Ulrich G<U+00E4>bler, "Zwingli the Loser".</ref> However, Zwingli<U+2019>s theology is considered the first expression of [[Reformed theology]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bagchi|2004|p=99}}</ref> Although his name is not widely recognised, Zwingli's legacy lives on in the basic confessions of the [[Reformed churches]] of today.<ref>{{Harvnb|G<U+00E4>bler|1986|p=160}}</ref> He is often called, after [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], the "Third Man of the Reformation".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rilliet|1964}}</ref>
