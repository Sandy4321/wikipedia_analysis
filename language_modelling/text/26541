'''Miros<U+0142>aw Iringh''' (nom-de-guerre "Stanko") (born February 28, 1914 in Warsaw<ref name=TP>Patrycja Bukalska, "Pytania Miros<U+0142>awa Iringha" (Miros<U+0142>aw Iringh's Question), [[Tygodnik Powszechny]], 2005-08-07, [http://tygodnik2003-2007.onet.pl/1547,1240075,1,dzial.html]</ref> died 1985) - was a [[Slovak people|Slovak]] [[lieutenant]] and a commander of a famous Slovakian unit - [[Platoon 535]]<ref>J<U+00F3>zef Ci<U+0105>gwa, Jan Szpernoga, "S<U+0142>owacy w Powstaniu Warszawskim.

==Background==
Miros<U+0142>aw came from a mixed Polish-Slovak family. His father moved to Warsaw from Slovakia, supposedly because of "political reasons" (at the time Slovakia was part of the [[Austria<U+2013>Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] empire) and married a Polish woman, Helena Perzanowska.<ref name=TP/> 

==[[Nazi invasion of Poland|September campaign]]==
In September of 1939, after the [[Nazi invasion of Poland]], together with his father Stanis<U+0142>aw, he took part in the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|defense of Warsaw]] in the ranks of the Czech and Slovak Volunteer Legion.<ref name=Pol/> After his father died in this battle, Miros<U+0142>aw took the conspiratorial name "Stanko" in honor of his father.<ref name=Pol/>

==Joining the resistance==
At the beginning of 1943, together with [[Adam Chalupec]], Miros<U+0142>aw Iringh organized the "Underground Slovak National Committee" (SKN), which made contact with the representatives of the Home Army, and established civilian and military relations.<ref name=Pol>"Udzia<U+0142> S<U+0142>owak<U+00F3>w w Powstaniu Warszawskim" (The Participation of Slovaks in the Warsaw Uprising), Polonus, [www.polonus.sk/downloads.php?cat_id=2&download_id=12 ]</ref> At the end of 1943 an agreement was reached between the SKN and the Home Army command, which called for the formation of a separate Slovak military unit within the structure of the Home Army - Platoon 535.<ref name=Pol/>. The unit was to be distinguished by armbands and a regimental standard in Slovak national colors, white-blue-red, as opposed to the red and white colors of the rest of the Home Army soldiers.<ref name=Pol/> Iringh's armband was made by the wife of one of the Polish members of SKN, Jadwiga Szantarek-Szczud<U+0142>owska. She sewed it out of a French broad riband [[military decoration]] which had been bestowed on her husband (Col. Mieczys<U+0142>aw Szczud<U+0142>owski) by [[Marshal Foch]] - the colors of the French flag are the same as that of the Slovak one.<ref name=TP/> Because of the similarity in colors, during the Warsaw Uprising, the civilians of Warsaw sometimes mistook the Slovak partisans for Frenchmen.<ref name=TP/>

During the Nazi occupation Iringh held a Slovak passport which allowed him certain "privileges" unavailable to Poles, which he used for anti-Nazi underground activity. For example, he was allowed to own a radio (ownership of these by Poles was illegal) which he used to monitor Allied news reports from the West<ref name=Pol/> which he then used as basis for articles in the underground newspapers.<ref name=TP/> The Slovak passport also saved him from being taken in so called [[<U+0141>apanka]]s (street round up), which made him a natural choice for a smuggler and distributor of the [[Bibula]] (Polish underground press).<ref name=TP/> According to the memoirs of his wife, Waleria (who was also active in the underground) on one occasion the <U+0141>apanka took place on a tram, while Iringh was carrying a brief case full of illegal newspapers. Iringh approached the German policeman in charge and stated that he was a foreigner and in turn he was asked for his documents. Miros<U+0142>aw handed the suitcase full of illegal contraband to the policeman and calmly looked for his passport. Once he had produced it, the suitcase was handed back and he was free to leave.<ref name=TP/> Iringh also prepared anti-Nazi pamphlets in Slovak which were distributed to the Slovak communities in Warsaw and [[Lwow]], as well as to [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] soldiers stationed in Warsaw, who although serving as allies of Germany were often quite sympathetic to the Polish resistance (and many of whom were of Slovak background).<ref name=TP/>

Iringh was also a photographer of the fighting and civilian everyday life during the insurrection.<ref name=Pol/> Many of his photographs are part of the collection of the [[National Library of Poland]]. Before the war, Iringh was a journalist, a profession which he tried to resume after the war.<ref>W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Jewsiewicki, "Powstanie warszawskie 1944: okiem polskiej kamery" (Warsaw Uprising 1944: through the eyes of Polish camera), Interpress, 1989, pg. 72, [http://books.google.com/books?id=qyHTAAAAMAAJ&q=Miros%C5%82aw+Iringh+zdjecia&dq=Miros%C5%82aw+Iringh+zdjecia&as_brr=0]</ref> He wrote for the newspapers [[<U+017D>ivot]] (the newspaper of the Slovakian Community in Poland, which Iringh helped to organize)<ref>Jan Spernoga, Zivot, "550 cislot Zivota", [www.tsp.org.pl/download/zivot/historia.pdf]</ref>, [[Gazeta Lubelska]],<ref name=TP/> and [[<U+017B>ycie Warszawy]]. 

==Warsaw Uprising and Platoon 535==

During the Warsaw Uprising Miros<U+0142>aw led his platoon in heavy fighting in the Czernakow district (although some soldiers of the platoon got trapped in other parts of Warsaw and were unable to join the main group - instead they fought independently in Praga).<ref name=TP/> Iringh's unit was strengthened by a number of foreign, non-Slovak, soldiers who were present in Warsaw and who also wanted to fight the Germans, and additionally by several escaped Soviet POWs.<ref name=TP/> According to the memoirs of former platoon members, Iringh was a commander noted for his frankness and directness, he always looked serious and never made jokes, which enabled him to enforce strict discipline in his unit.<ref name=TP/> At the same time he cared greatly for his soldiers, took part in direct fighting himself, even though at the time he was sick with [[pneumonia]].<ref name=TP/> One of the AK nurses assigned to his unit, Danuta Pietraszak (now Micha<U+0142>owska) remembers him as "Emaciated, in a [[hard hat]] instead of a [[helmet]], always with a cigarette, constantly coughing. He was in control of everyone, even our [[Georgians]]" (the last being a reference to the escaped Soviet POWs who were part of the unit).<ref name=TP/>

==After the war==
He was persecuted by communist authorities for having been a member of the AK and was refused employment for many years.<ref name=Pol/> Initially he worked as a free lance writer for various newspapers. However, in 1951 he lost his job due to his past membership in the Home Army.<ref name=TP/> His wife was given a choice of either divorcing him, or also losing her job. She refused, and they both became unemployed.<ref name=TP/> As a result, Iringh tried to support his family, even though by this time he was quite ill, by taking photographs and selling them on the street to passers-by.<ref name=TP/> In 1956 he started to work for the Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland although he was soon once again fired on the basis of an absurd accusation that he was plotting to separate the [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and Polish [[Spisz]] regions from Poland and join them to [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=TP/>

He died of lung cancer in 1985, and he is buried in the [[Warsaw]]'s [[Pow<U+0105>zki Cemetery]].

==Remembrance==

In June 2005, Miros<U+0142>aw Iringh's daughters transferred a collection of memorabilia about Iringh and Platoon 535 to the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] in [[Warsaw]] where they are currently on display.<ref name=Pol/> On August 31, 2007, Iringh's daughter, Bogus<U+0142>awa Iringh <U+2013> Nag<U+00F3>rska, accepted in her father's name the decoration of the Order of [[<U+013D>udov<U+00ED>t <U+0160>t<U+00FA>r]] ([[R<U+00E1>d <U+013D>udov<U+00ED>ta <U+0160>t<U+00FA>ra]]), second class, bestowed upon him posthumously by the [[President of Slovakia]] [[Ivan Ga<U+0161>parovi<U+010D>]].<ref name=Pol/>

One of the squares in the Czerniakow part of Warsaw, where his unit engaged in heavy fighting with the [[Germans]] is named after him.<ref name=TP/>
