'''King's Highway 74''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 74''', was a [[Provincial highways in Ontario|provincially maintained highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] that travelled north from [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] at [[New Sarum, Ontario|New Sarum]] to Middlsex County Road&nbsp;29 (Hamilton Road) on the outskirts of [[London, Ontario|London]]. The {{convert|22.4|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} was assumed by the province in September 1937. Aside from paving and the construction of an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Highway&nbsp;401]], it remained generally unchanged for the next six decades until it was [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] in 1997 and transferred to [[Elgin County]] and [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]]. The road has since been redesignated as '''Elgin County Road&nbsp;74''' and '''Middlsex County Road&nbsp;74'''.

== Route description ==
Highway&nbsp;74 began at an intersection with Highway&nbsp;3 in the community of New Sarum, midway between the city of [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]] to the west, and the town of [[Aylmer, Ontario|Aylmer]] to the east. It crossed the [[St. Thomas and Eastern Railway]] just north of Highway&nbsp;3 before curving to cross the West Catfish Creek, which it meandered alongside into [[Mapleton, Ontario|Mapleton]]. Immediately north of that community, the route curved to the north and was straight for the remainder of its route. The highway continued, entering the village of [[Belmont, Ontario|Belmont]], where it intersected a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line. North of there it crossed the boundary between [[Elgin County]] to the south and [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]] to the north. North of the county line, Highway&nbsp;74 continued into the community of [[Derwent, Ontario|Derwent]]. Shortly thereafter, it crossed and interchanged with Highway&nbsp;401 at Exit&nbsp;195. The highway ended just north of Highway&nbsp;401 in Nilestown at an intersection with Middlesex County Road&nbsp;29 (Hamilton Road).<ref name="km">{{cite book

== History ==
Highway&nbsp;74 was established in mid-1937 when the New Sarum to Dorchester Road was designated by the Department of Highways (DHO), the predecessor to the [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] (MTO). The section within Elgin County was assumed by the DHO on August&nbsp;25, 1937, while the section within Middlesex County was assumed one week later on September&nbsp;1.<ref name="assumed">{{cite report

Originally an unpaved gravel road, the route was paved between Belmont and its northern terminus by 1938.<ref>{{cite map
