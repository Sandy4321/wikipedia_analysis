'''Fish balls''' is a commonly cooked food in [[southern China]] and [[overseas Chinese]] communities. As the name suggests, the ball is made of [[fish]] meat that has been finely pulverized. Gourmet fish balls are pulverized by hand.  Fish balls are a type of food product made from [[surimi]] (<U+9B5A><U+6F3F>).

<U+9B5A><U+86CB> and <U+9B5A><U+65E6> can been used interchangeably, and are pronounced the same. <U+9B5A><U+65E6> is used at street hawker stalls and [[dai pai dong]] in Hong Kong.  <U+9B5A><U+4E38> (y<U+00FA> w<U+00E1>n) and <U+9C7C><U+5706> (y<U+00FA> yu<U+00E1>n) are more commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia.

==Production==
Nearly all [[meatballs]] (pork, beef, fish, etc...) made in Asia differ significantly in texture to their counterparts with European origins. Instead of grinding and forming meats, meat used for making meatballs is pounded. This is also often the case for fillings in steamed dishes. This process is what lends a smooth texture to the meatballs. Pounding unlike grinding uncoils and stretches previously wound and tangled protein strands in meat.

There are two kinds of fish balls in [[Hong Kong]]. One is smaller in size, yellow in colour, usually made with cheaper [[shark]] meat, and is sold in "strings" (<U+4E32>), each "string" containing five to seven fish balls "strung" on a [[bamboo]] [[skewer]]. Usually sold at food stalls. There are many stalls which support themselves just by selling this kind of fish ball, similar to [[hot dog]] [[Hot dog stand|stands]] in the [[United States]]. The fish balls can be either [[spicy]] (often called [[curry]] fish ball) or not. It is one of the most popular and representative "street foods" (<U+8857><U+982D><U+719F><U+98DF>) of Hong Kong.

The other kind is bigger in size, white in colour, made with more costly fish meat, and has a considerably different [[Texture (food)|texture]] and [[taste]]. This kind of fish ball is usually eaten with [[noodle]]s at [[restaurant]]s providing [[Chiuchow cuisine|Chiuchow-style]] [[noodle]] , and at some ''[[cha chaan teng]]s'', which also provide [[beef ball]] (<U+725B><U+4E38>) and [[cuttlefish ball]] (<U+58A8><U+9B5A><U+4E38>). Readily available in traditional market and [[supermarket]], the fish ball is also a popular ingredient for [[hot pot]].

One well known and popular purveyor of fish balls in broth is [[On Lee Fish Ball Noodles]], in [[Shau Kei Wan]].<ref name=food>Jessica Lam, Food, [[South China Morning Post]], June 7, 2007</ref>

Fish balls are cooked in many ways in [[Malaysia]]. Fish balls can served with soup and noodles like the Chiuchow style or served with [[Yong tau foo]]. There is also a type called ''"Fuzhou fish ball"'' which has pork fillings with the fish ball.

==Philippines==
The most commonly eaten type of fish balls is (unsurprisingly) colloquially known as ''fishballs''. It is somewhat flat in shape and most often made from the meat of [[cuttlefish]] or [[pollock]]. It is usually served with a sweet and spicy sauce or with a thick black sweet and sour sauce. It is a common snack food that is sold by mobile fryer stands and street corner food courts in many towns and cities.

Fish balls in the [[Philippines]] are sold by street vendors pushing mobile deep frying carts. They are usually served with a choice of three kinds of dipping sauces: Sour (pale orange colored) - vinegar, water, diced onions and garlic, Sweet (brown gravy colored) - corn starch, banana catsup, sugar and salt, and Hot/Sour (amber or deeper orange colored) - the sour variety with lots of small hot chilis added. Dark sauces are rare as these are soy sauce based and soy sauce is expensive in terms of food cost for street food. 
The latest (2006) iteration in the Philippine fishball industry is the introduction of 'ball' varieties: chicken, squid (cuttlefish actually), and kekiam. The last are low cost renditions vaguely resembling original Chinese delicacy of the same (soundwise) name. Chicken and squid balls as well as kekiam sell at 4 US Cents. Regular fishballs sell at 1 US Cent.
