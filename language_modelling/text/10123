'''HMS ''Reynard''''' was an 8-gun screw [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1848 and was wrecked on the [[Pratas Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]] on 31 May 1851.

==Construction==
The Admiralty originally ordered the ship on 25 April 1847 from Woolwich Dockyard as the steam schooner ''Plumper''.<ref name=RW213/> She was re-ordered from [[Deptford Dockyard]] as the screw sloop ''Reynard'' on 12 August 1847 to a design by [[John Edye]], and laid down in August that year. She was launched on 21 March 1848 at Deptford and commissioned at Woolwich on 1 August 1848.<ref name=RW213/>

''Reynard'' was the only ship ever built to the design. She was constructed of wood, was {{convert|147|ft|0|in|m|1}} long and {{convert|27|ft|10|in|m|1}} in the beam, and had a mean draught of {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She had a displacement of 656 tons.<ref name=RW213/>

She was powered by a [[J. and G. Rennie]] two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. Rated at 60 [[nominal horsepower]], and developing 165 [[horsepower#Indicated horsepower|indicated horsepower]], this unit was capable of driving her at {{convert|8.2|kn|km/h|lk=in}}.<ref name=RW213/> 

Her armament of 8 guns consisted of two 32-pounder (56 cwt) muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns and six 32-pounder (25 cwt) muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns mounted to fire in a traditional broadside arrangement.<ref name=RW213/><ref name=gun group=Note>"32-pounder" denotes the weight of projectile fired, 56 (or 25) cwt is the weight of the gun ("cwt" = [[hundredweight]])</ref>

==Service==
After commissioning, ''Reynard'' served in the western squadron under [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Napier]] and then in the East Indies. She served on the [[China Station]] in an anti-piracy role. She left Hong Kong to return to Woolwich to pay off, but on her way was required to accompany the brig ''Pilot'' to rescue the crew of the brig ''Velocipede'', which had run aground on Pratas shoal, 170 miles southeast of Hong Kong.<ref name=WL>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowShip.php?id=175|title=HMS ''Reynard''|publisher=William Loney website|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>

==Fate==
In rescuing the crew of ''Velocipede'', ''Reynard'' herself was wrecked on the [[Pratas Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]] on 31 May 1851.<ref name=RW213/> The whole crew survived the sinking.<ref name=WL/>
