'''Pigeon racing''' is a sport involving the racing of specially trained [[Racing pigeon]]s.
==History==
[[Pigeons]] have been [[domesticated]] for thousands of years. The predecessors of modern day Racing pigeons were pigeons bred for their homing ability, primarily to carry messages. "[[pigeon post|Pigeon Posts]]" have been establish all over the world and while mainly used in the [[War pigeon|military]], some are still in service today.

Modern pigeon racing originated in [[Belgium]] in the early [[19th century]]<ref>[http://ezinearticles.com/?Pigeon-Racing---Early-History&id=538569 Pigeon Racing - Early History]</ref>.

==Racing==
In short, competing birds are taken from their lofts and must race home. The time taken and distance are recorded and the fastest bird (distance/time) is declared the winner.<br />

Provided it survives the many hazards associated with racing, a single pigeon could compete from about 6 months of age and still be in competition at over ten years of age. Such feats are uncommon, however, and the average racing career rarely exceeds three years.<br />

To compete in a race, it must wear a permanent, unique numbered ring or band that is placed on its leg at about 5 days of age. For a race to be conducted, the competing pigeons must be entered into the race, usually at the organisation's clubhouse, and taken away from their home to be released at a predetermined time and location. The distance between the bird's home loft and the racepoint is carefully measured by [[GPS]] and the time taken by the bird to return is measured using one of the two acceptable timing methods.
===Traditional timing method===
The traditional method of timing racing pigeons involves a rubber ring with a unique serial number being placed on the birds leg before being sent to race. The serial number is recorded and the bird carries the ring home. When the first bird returns, its trainer removes the ring and places it in a specially designed [[Pigeon Racing Clock|clock]]. The time that the ring was placed in the clock and that is recorded as the official time that the competing bird arrived home.

Although serving its purpose, this method has proved somewhat problematic for a few reasons:
#The pigeon's "official time" is not the actual time it arrived, it is the time the ring was removed, placed in the clock and recorded, which could be many vital seconds later.
#Exceptional pigeons may arrive home first on multiple occasions, [[Bird intelligence|knowing]] it is going to have the ring removed speedily, which may be uncomfortable, the pigeon could be reluctant to enter the loft for the trainer.

===Electronic timing method===
{{Main article|Electric Timing System}} 
The latest development and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is having the bird carry a [[RFID]] chip which instantly records the time when the pigeon arrives from the race.

==Training==
Racing pigeons are housed together in a specially designed [[loft]]. From about 5 weeks of age until the end of its racing career, the racing loft it the pigeons home and this is where it returns to on race day. <br />
[[Image:Postduiven.jpg|left|220px|thumb|A kit of racing pigeons loft flying.]]Young pigeons are trained progressively for at least six months before being allowed to compete in a race event.  A racing pigeon's initial training involves familiarising it with the loft and its surroundings and training it to use the various features of its home (entry point, ect.). It is also this critical time that the birds learn commands, such as entering the loft when the trainer whistles.<br />

After a few weeks of initial training and 'homing in', the young birds are allowed outside for the first time. This is usually before they can fly strongly so as to prevent an overzealous pigeon from flying away before it can find its way back home. As the birds grow older, they become stronger and smarter and are therefore allowed to fly further and further away from their home loft. When a few trainers fly their pigeons in the same area, these loft flying kits (as flocks of pigeons are called) can number in the thousands. This 'loft flying' familiarises the birds with their home area and builds fitness. It does not, however, help them much in relation to finding their home from long distances away, a fundamental of pigeon racing. As confident flyers, the young pigeons are taken on progressively longer 'training tosses', driven a distance away from their home and released. This is like the format of a real race, however on a much smaller scale and it is usually not timed in the same way as a race. This practice of loft flying and tossing continues throughout a pigeon's career.
<br /> Training methods are as varied as the pigeons themselves. Lots of fanciers believe their system is the secret to their success and gaurd these hard learned lessons closely, most will tell you of their basic strategy but few will share the details of their success. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usally begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often times the nestbox is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their mate or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning is one of the key elements in a lot of racing programs.<br />

==Hazards==
As pigeon racing takes place over great distances in the sky, instead of on a [[racetrack]], there are many hazards that could befall a pigeon during racing as well as training. The main hazard encountered by racing pigeons is predation by [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]<ref>[http://www.pigeonracing.com/hawks.htm Birds of Prey and Racing Pigeons]</ref>. The killing of valuable pigeons by wild predators has led some pigeon fanciers to kill birds of prey<ref>[http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=270&id=812202004 Pigeon racers suspected in falcon killings]</ref>.

It is thought that racing pigeons rely on the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to find their way home. Some evidence has surfaced indicating that mobile phone towers may be interrupting the birds navigation<ref>[http://omega.twoday.net/stories/286416/ Mobile phone mast blamed for vanishing pigeons]</ref>. No published research has investigated this theory however.
==Breeding==
[[Image:Jung_Homing_pigeons.JPG|right|200px|thumb|A pair of young racing pigeons, 9 days old.]]
Pigeons can breed at about 6 months of age. The hen lays two eggs that are incubated by both parents for 18 days. Pigeon breeders are careful in selecting birds to pair together so as to continue improving the breed and gain a competitive edge. It is this [[selective breeding]] that has given rise to the racing pigeons of today, capable of finding their way home from over 1600[[km]] away and fly at speeds in excess of 130[[km/h]].
==Pigeon racing by region==
===Pigeon racing in Asia===
Pigeon racing is becoming increasingly popular in parts of Asia, where millions of [[dollars]] are bet on the races, just like [[horse racing]].
===Pigeon racing in Oceania===
====Australia====
The largest Racing Organisation in [[Australia]] is the Central Cumberland Federation.<br />
In Australia, velocities are recorded in metres per minute.

===Pigeon racing in Europe===
====UK====
The first regular races in [[Great Britain]] in 1881<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Pigeon-Flying 1911encyclopedia.org]</ref>. The [[British Royal Family]] first became involved with pigeon racing in [[1886]] when the originator of the sport, King Leopold of Belgium, gifted them breeding stock. The tradition continues to this day, with a bird of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] even winning a race in 1990<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4832.asp 80 facts about The Queen]</ref>.

===Pigeon racing in the USA===
The sport was introduced into the United States about 1875, although regular racing did not begin until 1878<ref>[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Pigeon-Flying 1911encyclopedia.org]</ref>.
===Pigeon racing in Africa===
[[South Africa]] is the home of the richest One-Loft Race in the world, the Sun City Million Dollar Pigeon Race<ref>[http://www.scmdpr.com/ SCMDPR Homepage]</ref>.

==One-Loft Racing==
One-Loft Racing is the process of training birds bred by many different breeders in the same loft, under the same trainer and in the same conditions (as apposed to trainer against trainer in their own lofts and usually with their own birds). It is thought to be the fairest method of proving which bloodline or breeder is best and usually provides the highest amount of prize money.
==Notable people and pigeons==
The [[Janssen Brothers]] are a very successful, famous pigeon flying family from [[Arendonk]], Belgium. Descendants of their pigeons can be found racing all around the world.
