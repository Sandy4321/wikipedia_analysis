'''Michael Richard''' "'''Micky'''" '''Adams''' (born 8 November 1961) is an [[English people|English]] former professional [[association football|footballer]] turned football manager, who is in charge of [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]]. As a player he was a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|full back]], and made a total of 438 league appearances in a nineteen year professional career in [[the Football League]], including five years with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at the highest level. He began his managerial career as player-manager for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 1994 and has lead several teams at varying levels with mixed success, being named Manager of the Season twice, and sacked a number of times.

Born in [[Sheffield]], Adams was part of the youth team at [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] from the age of twelve until released in 1977. He turned professional at the Third Division team [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] in 1979, where he  established himself in the first team, winning a move in 1983 to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] who were in the First Division. He spent four years at Coventry before being sold on to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1987. He was bought by Southampton for <U+00A3>250,000 in 1989, where he enjoyed five years of top-flight football. He was loaned out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1994, before he signed with Fulham later in the year. Appointed as Fulham's player-manager in March 1996, he led the club out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in [[1996<U+2013>97 in English football|1996<U+2013>97]], and was named as the Third Division Manager of the Season. Sacked by Fulham despite his success, he walked out on [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] after less than two weeks in charge, and instead took charge at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in November 1997. He was sacked after the club were relegated at the end of the season. At this point he ended his playing career.

He joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager, taking charge for one [[Premier League]] game in a caretaker capacity. He returned to management with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in April 1999. He led the club to the Third Division title in [[2000<U+2013>01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01]], winning the division's Manager of the Season award for a second time. He then moved to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] as an assistant, before finally being named as the club's manager in April 2002. He took the club to the Premier League as [[Football League First Division|First Division]] runners-up in [[2002<U+2013>03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03]], though he tendered his resignation in October 2004, having failed to keep the club in the top-flight. He took charge at former club Coventry City in January 2005, though lost his job in January 2007 after failing to take the club out of the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. He returned to Brighton in May 2008, though his second spell in charge would only last nine months. He was appointed as manager of Port Vale in June 2009, before he departed for Sheffield United in December 2010, with Vale heading for promotion out of League Two. He failed to prevent United being relegated into [[Football League One|League One]], and so was sacked in May 2011; this enabled him to return to Port Vale as manager, who had failed poorly in his absence. He has been married twice and has four daughters.

==Playing career==

After 103 appearances for [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Gillingham he moved on to top-flight [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in 1983 for a fee between <U+00A3>75,000 and <U+00A3>85,000.<ref name="Sentinel" /><ref>{{cite book | first=Roger|last= Triggs | title=The Men Who Made Gillingham Football Club| publisher=Tempus Publishing Ltd | year=2001| isbn=978-0-7524-2243-5|page=38}}</ref> He struggled with injury during his time at [[Highfield Road]], and was never popular with the fans.<ref name="up close" /> Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four year period before [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] manager [[Billy Bremner]] took him to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for a <U+00A3>110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's [[FA Cup Semi-finals|FA Cup Semi-final]] defeat to former club Coventry at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]], as Coventry won 3<U+2013>2 in extra time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/OnThisWeek/0,,10269~1030058,00.html|title=Hillsborough History|date=26 May 2007|work=ccfc.co.uk|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref> Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the [[1987 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off Final]] to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], again after extra time.

In April 1990, Adams was recalled alongside new signing [[Oleksiy Cherednyk]] and they played out the remainder of the season together.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=213}}</ref>

Adams began to establish himself as the first-choice left-back at the start of [[1990<U+2013>91 in English football|the 1990<U+2013>91 season]], partnered first by Cherednyk and then Dodd, and finally by [[Barry Horne (footballer)|Barry Horne]] on the right.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=219}}</ref> Once he had overcome the niggling injuries of his first two seasons at [[The Dell (Southampton)|The Dell]], Adams' consistency began to ensure that the left-back position was more or less his own, with his energetic forays along the touchline helping to give the side an extra cutting edge.<ref name = "ITN"/> His first goals for the Saints came in [[1991<U+2013>92 in English football|the 1991<U+2013>92 season]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=223}}</ref> Against West Ham on 14 April 1992, he scored the only goal with a far-post volley in the 88th minute after [[Matthew Le Tissier]] had created space to whip over a cross: the goal was described as "a moment of true class in an otherwise ordinary game".<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=222}}</ref>

During [[1992<U+2013>93 FA Premier League|the inaugural season]] of the [[Premier League]], Adams missed only four games, making 38 appearances with four goals, with his right-wing partner now being [[Jeff Kenna]], with manager [[Ian Branfoot]] playing Dodd and Benali further forward.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=228}}</ref> He wrote himself into the history books, for all the wrong reasons, when he was sent off for dissent on 19 August 1992 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] at [[Loftus Road]], during the second game of the season.<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=224}}</ref> His was the first ever red card in the Premiership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orange.co.uk/sport/football/6057_pr.htm|title=Ask the Gaffer football trivia archive|work=orange.co.uk|accessdate=16 August 2009}}</ref> The [[1993<U+2013>94 FA Premier League|1993<U+2013>94]] Premiership season was Adams' last in the top flight; he started the season as the preferred choice at left-back before losing out to [[Simon Charlton]]. He featured in 19 out of 42 league games that season as Southampton finished 18th and narrowly avoided relegation. His final game for Southampton came in a 1<U+2013>0 defeat at home to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], immediately following which Branfoot was sacked as manager, to be replaced by [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]].<ref>{{cite book| title=In That Number <U+2013> A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |last=  |first=  | publisher= | year= | isbn= |page=235}}</ref> Adams never played under Ball and was loaned out to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in March 1994 until the end of the season.<ref name = "ITN"/> He scored three goals in ten games for the "Potters", but did not join the club on a permanent basis as the management staff refused to allow him to help out as a coach at the club's academy.<ref name="up close" /> In his five years with Southampton, Adams made a total of 174 first-team appearances, scoring seven goals.<ref name = "ITN"/>

In July 1994, he joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on a free transfer where he was reunited with Ian Branfoot in preparation for the "Cottagers" [[1994<U+2013>95 Fulham F.C. season|1994<U+2013>95 season]]. Fulham had just been relegated to Division Three (the bottom tier of the professional league) for the first time in their history. He signed with the club on the understanding that Branfoot would teach him the ropes of coaching.<ref name="up close" /> They finished seventh in the league that season, but due to a restructuring of the league which saw one less promotion place in the three lower divisions, Fulham missed out on a play-off place. When Branfoot became general manager in March 1996, Adams was appointed player-manager of a Fulham side on course for their lowest ever finish <U+2013> 17th in Division Three.

==Managerial career==
Before going into management, the "straight-talking [[Yorkshire]]man"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/lmatv/interview-3786.html|title=Adams aims to upset the odds|date=21 July 2003|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> had already demonstrated his ability to spot talented youngsters. Around 1994 he spotted [[Wayne Bridge]] playing for Olivers Battery; he recommended Bridge to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who then signed him as a trainee in July 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/portvale/Port-Vale-Fresh-start-players-says-Adams/article-1060991-detail/article.html|title=Port Vale: Fresh start for players, says Adams|last=Shaw|first=Steve|date=9 June 2009|work=The Sentinel |accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref>

===Fulham===
Adams moved into management with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], taking over from [[Ian Branfoot]] in March 1996 with the London club languishing in 91st place in the league pyramid.<ref name="up close" /> After he had helped the club avoid non-league football, Fulham were promoted to Division Two as runners-up in the following season's final table,<ref name="ESPN" /> and Adams was given the Third Division Manager of the Season award. He built his side on free transfers and small fees, installing belief and self-confidence in the players at his disposal rather than spending big money.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/ClubHistory/Managers/MickyAdams.aspx|title=Micky Adams|work=fulhamfc.com|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref> The highest fee he spent on a player during his reign was <U+00A3>200,000 for former "Saints" teammate [[Paul Moody (footballer)|Paul Moody]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-3862.html|title=Adams ready for Roman's empire|date=22 August 2003|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

Following [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]'s takeover of Fulham, Adams was dismissed as manager in September 1997 in favour of the higher profile combination of [[Kevin Keegan]] (director of football) and [[Ray Wilkins]] (head coach).<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=23&&cc=5739|title=Micky Adams|last=Johnson|first=Dale|work=ESPN|accessdate=5 June 2009}} {{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

{{quote|"I have to say that it was probably the right decision because look where they are now. All Mr Fayed has to say is 'there's my record'. At the time getting rid of me was a harsh decision. A director at the club told me I was going to be the [[Alex Ferguson]] of Fulham. I signed a five-year contract... and four months later I was sacked."|Adams speaking in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/portvale/Port-Vale-McParland-require-skin-says-Adams/article-1198753-detail/article.html|title=Port Vale: McParland will require thick skin, says Adams|date=28 July 2009|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=28 July 2009}}</ref>}}

===Swansea to Brentford to Nottingham===
Shortly after his dismissal from Fulham, Adams made a quick return to management with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in Division Three, but left after thirteen days and three matches in charge. Adams claimed that the money he had been promised to strengthen the team had not been forthcoming.<ref name="ESPN" />

Before 1997 was out, Adams took his third job of the [[1997<U+2013>98 in English football|1997<U+2013>98 season]] when he was named manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. The club had suffered a slump in league form after losing the previous season's Division Two [[1997 Football League Second Division play-off Final|play-off final]], and were struggling near the foot of the table. He signed striker [[Andy Scott (English footballer)|Andy Scott]] from [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a fee of <U+00A3>75,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Port-Vale-Scott-ready-lock-horns-boss/story-13438795-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Scott ready to lock horns with former boss|date=30 September 2011|work=The Sentinel|accessdate=30 September 2011}}</ref> Despite Adams' efforts, Brentford were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to Division Three on the last day of the season, and the club was bought out by [[Ron Noades]], who installed himself as the new Brentford manager.<ref name="CT" />

After taking a break from the game, Adams joined [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] as assistant manager under [[Dave Bassett]]. Bassett was dismissed in January 1999 and so Adams took charge as [[caretaker manager]] for a single [[Premier League|Premiership]] match, before [[Ron Atkinson]] was appointed as Bassett's replacement.<ref name="ESPN" />

===Brighton===
Adams returned to management in April 1999 with Division Three team [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. The club were in the middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the [[Goldstone Ground]] just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-312.html|title=High flying Seagulls delight Adams |date=15 March 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker [[Bobby Zamora]].<ref name="ESPN" /> The <U+00A3>100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-547.html|title= Micky Adams is named Division Three winner |date=22 May 2001 |work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

In his second season as manager, [[2000<U+2013>01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01]], Adams guided Brighton to promotion as Division Three champions after the club had spent five seasons in the league's basement division. A late chase for the title proved to be unnecessary,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-355.html|title= Adams hoping to catch Chesterfield |date=23 March 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> as high flying Chesterfield were deducted nine points for financial irregularities,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-467.html|title= Micky and Nicky promoted |date=2 May 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> leaving Brighton ten points clear at the season's end. He was named as Third Division Manager of the season for a second time, also picking up the [[Football League Third Division Manager of the Month|Third Division Manager of the Month]] award in September 2000.

Adams was clear about his ambitions at managing at a higher level, stating his disappointment at not being offered the management positions at either [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] or [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the summer of 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-711.html|title=Adams sad to miss Premier interviews|date=16 July 2001|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> He did leave "Seagulls" in October 2001, though by then he had already set the foundations for Brighton to achieve a second successive promotion as Division Two champions in [[2001<U+2013>02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02]].

===Coventry City===
In January 2005, Adams made a return to management in the Championship with struggling [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], a club he had been at during his playing career.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Adams named as Coventry manager| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/4193941.stm| publisher= BBC Sport| date= 21 January 2005| accessdate= 22 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-4876.html|title=Coventry appoint Adams |date=21 January 2005|work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> Adams managed to save the club from relegation by the end of [[2004<U+2013>05 in English football|the season]], winning the [[Football League Championship Manager of the Month]] award for April in the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-4955.html|title=Adams wins two awards in the week |date=6 May 2005 |work=LMA|accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref>

He was expected by some to mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in [[2005<U+2013>06 Coventry City F.C. season|2005<U+2013>06]], which was the club's first season in the new [[Ricoh Arena]]. The team started out poorly, but improved in the second half of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in [[Dennis Wise]].<ref name="CT" /> However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.

Midway through the [[2006<U+2013>07 Coventry City F.C. season|following season]] however, following a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form. A 5<U+2013>0 defeat at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] began a sequence of eight games without a win, including six defeats. This culminated in a 2<U+2013>0 home defeat to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in the [[FA Cup]], a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship.<ref name="CT">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-city-fc-news/tm_headline=factfile--micky-adams&method=full&objectid=18490990&siteid=50003-name_page.html|title=Factfile: Micky Adams|last=Smith|first=Martin|date=17 January 2007|work=Coventry Telegraph|accessdate=5 June 2009}}</ref> Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite news| title= Adams sacked as Coventry manager| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/coventry_city/6270295.stm| publisher= BBC Sport| date= 17 January 2007| accessdate= 22 July 2007}}</ref> He admitted that the sale of [[Gary McSheffrey]] to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that "I genuinely believe that I could have turned it around" and "I tried my best and that's all I can do."<ref name="could have">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Adams%3A+I+could%27ve+turned+it+around%3B+%2B%2B%2B+MICKY+ADAMS+SACKING.-a0157846197|title=Adams: I could've turned it around|last=Turner|first=Andy|date=18 January 2007|work=Coventry Evening Telegraph|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>
