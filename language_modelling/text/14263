==Biography==

===Early life===
Kawakita was born in Tokyo. His father, Kawakita Daijiro, a highly decorated officer in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and subsequently an instructor at the [[Baoding Military Academy]] in [[Beijing]], was killed under mysterious circumstances, possibly for treason by Japanese agents. <ref name = Fu> {{cite book | last = Fu | first = Poshek | year = 2003 | title = Between Shanghai and Hong Kong: The Politics of Chinese Cinemas| publisher =Stanford University Press | location =  | isbn = 0804745188}} page 95-98 </ref>. Following graduation from high school in Japan, Kawakita travelled to China in 1922 to study at [[Beijing University]] <ref name = Fu/> and continued on to [[Heidelberg]] in Germany for further studies. He was hired by the German movie company [[Universum Film AG]] and sent back to Japan as its representative. <ref name = Sharp/>

===Pre-war career===
Kawakita formed his own company, Towa Trading in October 1928<ref name = Fu/>. He met his wife, Kashiko, when she came to work at the company as his secretary, and they used their honeymoon in 1932 to make the first of many trips to Europe to acquire movies for the Japanese market. Among his earliest successes were [[Leontine Sagan]]<U+2019>s [[M<U+00E4>dchen in Uniform]], although he also worked with many other European directors, including [[G. W. Pabst]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Clair]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Julien Duvivier]]. The films Kawakita imported were released to the market via [[Toho|Toho Studios]]. Kawakita also brought Japanese films to the [[Venice Film Festival]] and other overseas venues. <ref name = Sharp/>


In 1937, he played an important role in the 1937 German-Japanese joint venture ''[[The Daughter of the Samurai]]'', directed by [[Arnold Fanck]] and [[Mansaku Itami]]. In the [[1938 Venice International Film Festival]], ''[[Five Scouts]]'' (''Gonin no sekk<U+014D>hei'') by [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] was nominated best film, the first time a Japanese film had won a major award at an overseas film festival. <ref name = Baskett> {{cite book | last = Baskett | first = Michael | year = 2008 | title = The Attractive Empire: Transnational Film Culture in Imperial Japan| publisher = University of Hawaii Press | location =  | isbn = 9780824831639 }} page 121 </ref>.

In 1938, Kawakita, who was fluent in Chinese as well as in German, turned his attention to China, working on a Sino-Japanese joint venture, [[The Road to Peace in the Orient]], directed by [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], investing much of his own capital in a project which he hoped would project Sino-Japanese harmony. However, the film was a commercial failure as the Chinese public say Kawakita as a mouthpiece of the Japanese military<ref name = Fu/> and the Japanese found the Chinese language movie with Japanese subtitled hard to understand. The Japanese Army then asked Kawakita to head the newly formed [[China United Productions Ltd.]] (or "Zhonglian" for short); a merger between [[Xinhua Film Company]] and eleven other Shanghai studios. Kawakita initially hesitated, but realized that the project would proceed with or without him. The studio produced movies with local staff and actors aimed at local Chinese audiences, and had a staff of over 3000 employees. Although Kawakita maintained relations with high ranking officials in the Japanese military and the [[Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China|Nanjing Nationalist government]] (Shanghai mayor [[Chen Gongbo]] as honorary president), he insisted that the company act independently and to continue to pursue entertainment themes over propaganda, and thus often encountered opposition from Japanese censors and military officials, so much so that there were rumors of a plot by the [[Kwantung Army]] <ref name = Fu/> or of the [[Kempeitai]] <ref name =Hu> {{cite book | last =Hu | first = Tze-Yu | year = 2013 | title = Japanese Animation: East Asian Perspectives| publisher =Hong Kong University Press | location =  | isbn = 9781617038099 }} page 42 </ref>. to assassinate him. 

==Post-war career==
After the [[surrender of Japan]], Kawakita returned to Japan, where he was arrested by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation forces]] and charged as a Class-B war criminal; however, he was soon released after the authorities received many statements in his defense from Chinese and Jews he had protected while in Shanghai. <ref name = Sharp/>

He was permitted to resume his position as president of Towa Trading in 1950, and changed the company name to Toho-Towa in 1951.  He continued to make efforts to promote Japanese cinema overseas, and screened ''[[Rashomon]]'' by [[Akira Kurosawa]] at the Venice Film Festival in 1951 where it won the [[Golden Lion]] award<ref name = Sharp/>. He was production supervisor for the 1953 American-Japanese joint venture [[Anatahan (film)| ''Anatahan'']], directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]]. <ref name =Bxter> {{cite book | last =Baxter | first = John | year = 1998 | title = Von Sternberg| publisher = University of Kentucky Press | location =  | isbn = 0813126010 }} page 251-253 </ref>.

In 1960, Kawakita established the [[Japan Film Library Council]] to promote Japanese cinema overseas and to make materials available to foreign researchers. He also was a founder of the [[Japan Art Theatre Guild]], to promote international [[art film]] to Japan. His daughter, Kazuko Kawakita became an assistant to Akira Kurosawa on the 1960 [[The Bad Sleep Well]]. She later married actor [[Juzo Itami]]. <ref name = Sharp/>

In November 1973, Kawakita was awarded the [[Order of the Sacred Treasures]], 2nd class. Kawakira died in 1981 of [[liver cirrhosis]].

Following his death, the Kawakita Award was created in 1983 to honor individuals or organizations who have contributed to the promotion of Japanese cinema overseas. Its first recipient was [[Donald Richie]]. His former home in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]], Japan has been turned into a memorial museum. <ref name = Sharp/>
