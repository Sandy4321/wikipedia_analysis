The study of the '''diet of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture''' has provided important insights into the early [[history of Europe]]. The [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], which existed in the present-day [[Southeast Europe|southeastern European]] nations of [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]] during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] and [[Copper Age]], from approximately 5500 BC to 2750 B.C., left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.<ref name="Mallory">{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth|year= 1989|publisher= Thames and Hudson|location= London|isbn= 050005052X|oclc= 246601873}}</ref> Refer to the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|main article]] for a general description of this culture; this article deals with its [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary practices]], including techniques associated with [[agriculture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[hunting]].

{{details|Geography of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture}}
Cucuteni-Trypillian sites have yielded substantial evidence to prove that the inhabitants practiced agriculture, raised domestic livestock, and hunted wild animals for food. Although the region lying northwest of the Black Sea may not seem to have a climate or conditions favorable for the development of one of the first civilizations on earth, especially compared to other more famous [[Cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]] such as the [[Nile|Nile River Valley]] or [[Mesopotamia]] (which had warmer climates), the land and climate of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture was actually well-suited for the development of an agricultural civilization. This region of mixed forests, rivers, mountains and plains was actually very fertile, with conditions that were well suited for human civilization. 

In addition to these favorable environmental conditions of the geographical region where this culture lived, there was another factor that helped to create ideal conditions for the development of an agricultural society, namely the [[Holocene climatic optimum]], which lasted roughly from 7000 to 3000 B.C. This era experienced warmer and moister conditions than have been present at any other time since the end of the last Ice Age to the present day, thus providing a great advantage to farmers and livestock herders.

==Agriculture==
{{See also|Neolithic Revolution}}
Archaeological evidence indicates that primitive [[Ard (plough)|plowing]] was done by the farmers of the Cucuteni-Trypillian settlements. Cultivating the soil, tending livestock, and harvesting the crops were probably the main occupations of most of the members of this society. There is also evidence that they may have raised bees.<ref>{{Citation | last = Crane | first = Eva | title = The world history of beekeeping and honey hunting |  place = New York | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | pages = 40<U+2013>41 | url = http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ANTSvKj1AZEC&oi | oclc = 41049690 | isbn = 0415924677}}</ref> Although wine grapes were cultivated by these people, there is no solid evidence to date to prove that they actually made wine from them. The cereal grains were ground and baked as [[Flatbread|unleavened bread]] in clay ovens or on heated stones in the hearth fireplace in the house.

==Livestock==
{{See also|Zooarchaeology}}
The archaeological remains of animals found at Cucuteni-Trypillian sites indicate that the inhabitants practiced animal husbandry. Their domesticated livestock consisted primarily of cattle, and included smaller numbers of swine, sheep and goats. There is evidence, based on some of the surviving artistic depictions of animals from Cucuteni-Trypillian sites, that the [[ox]] was employed as a [[Working animal|draft animal]].<ref name="Com<U+0219>a">{{Cite journal | last = Com<U+0219>a | first = Eugen | authorlink = http://www.iianthropology.org/eugencomsa.html | title = Cultura plantelor <U+00EE>n cursul epocii neolitice pe teritoriul Rom<U+00E2>niei | trans_title = Cultivated plants of the Neolithic current epoch in Romanian territory | journal = Terra nostra: culegere de materiale privind istoria agriculturii <U+00EE>n Rom<U+00E2>nia (Our earth: selections from a material perspective of agricultural history in Romania) | volume = 3 | pages = 243<U+2013>252 | publisher = Consiliul Superior al Agriculturii | location = Bucharest | year = 1973 | format = Romanian | oclc = 72954112}}</ref> Another working animal whose remains have been found in these sites is the ubiquitous [[dog]]. 

Archaeologists have uncovered both the remains as well as artistic depictions of the horse in Cucuteni-Trypillian sites. However, whether these finds were of domesticated or wild horses is a matter of some debate. It is known that before domestication, humans hunted and ate wild horses, and so far there has been no absolute proof uncovered that would provide solid evidence that the horse remains found in these settlements belonged to animals that were either consumed or were used as domestic work animals. There is evidence that exists elsewhere that shows that horses were kept by some humans as domestic meat animals (similar to cattle), prior to their eventual use for draft work, and such may possibly be the case with these settlements, as well. There are still many questions as yet unanswered about this subject.<ref name="Cuco<U+0219>1">{{Cite journal | last = Cuco<U+0219> | first = <U+0218>tefan | title = Faza Cucuteni B <U+00EE>n zona subcarpatic<U+0103> a Moldovei | trans_title = Cucuteni B period in the lower Carpathian region of Moldova | journal = Bibliotheca Memoriae antiquitatis (BMA) (Memorial Library antiquities) | volume = 6 | publisher = Muzeul de Istorie Piatra Neam<U+021B> (Historical Museum Piatra Neam<U+021B>) | location = Piatra Neam<U+021B>, Romania | year = 1999 | url = http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/BMA_2.html | language = Romanian | oclc = 223302267}}</ref>

The first evidence of horse domestication for use as working animals did take place during the same time that the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture flourished; depending on the source, this was from between 4000-2500 B.C. Moreover, this took place in eastern Ukraine and [[Kazakhstan]], not far from the Cucuteni-Trypillian settlements. Archaeologists have also found horse-head [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] in Cucuteni-Trypillian sites. However, these clubs were actually imported from outside of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture's borders, from [[Suvorovo]], [[Bulgaria]]. Still, this does not conclusively prove one way or the other whether the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture utilized horses for transport or other work.<ref>{{Citation | first = Valentin A. | last = Dergachev | author-link = http://www.ant.md/en/professors/dergachev.htm | contribution = Two studies in defense of the migration concept | conference = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, 2000 | editor-last = Boyle | editor-first = Katherine V. | editor2-last = Renfrew | editor2-first = Colin | editor3-last = Levine | editor3-first = Marsha | booktitle = Ancient Interactions: East and West in Eurasia | series = McDonald Institute monographs | year = 2002 | pages = 93<U+2013>112 | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxbow Books | url = http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/publications/monographs/conference-volumes/ | isbn = 1902937198 | oclc = 52221476}}</ref>

==Hunting==
Members of the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture supplemented their diet with hunting. They used [[Animal trapping|traps]] to catch their prey, as well as various weapons, including the [[Bow (weapon)|bow-and-arrow]], the spear, and clubs. To help them in stalking game, they sometimes disguised themselves with [[camouflage]].<ref name="Cuco<U+0219>1" />
