'''Holstein-Rendsburg''' is the name of a line of the [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburg family]] that existed from 1290 to 1459.

== Rise and fall of the county ==
The Schauenburgs had ruled in [[Holstein]] since 1110/1111. In 1290, when Count [[Gerhard I of Holstein-Itzehoe]] died, his portion of Holstein was divided into 3 parts. From this emerged the counties of [[Holstein-Pl<U+00F6>n]], [[Holstein-Pinneberg]] and Holstein-Rendsburg.

The below-mentioned counts ruled the territory until the last Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, [[Adolphus VIII of Holstein|Adolphus VIII]], died in 1459. The Schauenburgs had almost died out; only the line of Holstein-Pinneberg still existed, but their count, [[Otto II of Schaumburg]] was not able to secure his inheritance.

Instead, in 1460, King [[Christian I of Denmark, Norway and Sweden|Christian I of Denmark]], a nephew of Adolphus VIII, who had helped him succeed to the Danish throne, was named as the new lord over the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] and [[Holstein|County of Holstein]].
