'''''DeRolph v. State''''' was a landmark case in [[Ohio]] [[constitutional law]] in which the [[Supreme Court of Ohio|Ohio Supreme Court]] ruled that the state's method for funding [[public education]] was unconstitutional.<ref name="pd070323">{{cite news | first = Scott | last = Stephens | title = School-funding suit brought changes, but challenges remain | curly = y | url = http://blog.cleveland.com/earlyedition/2007/03/schoolfunding_suit_brought_cha.html | work = [[The Plain Dealer]] | location = [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] | date = 2007-03-23 | accessdate = 2009-01-31}}</ref> Handed down on March 24, 1997, the 4-3 opinion said that the state funding system "fails to provide for a thorough and efficient system of common schools" as required by the [[Ohio Constitution]] and directed the state to find a remedy.<ref name="steps">{{cite web | curly = y | url = http://www.donet.com/~eprice/oscmjrty.html | title = The DeRolph Decision and Educational Adequacy | accessdate = 2009-01-31 | publisher = Supporters of Thorough and Efficient Public Schools}}</ref> The court would look at the case several times over the next 12 years before relinquishing [[jurisdiction]], though the underlying problems with the school funding system were never fully solved.<ref name="pd070323"/>

==Background==
Following Ohio's 1851 [[Ohio_Constitution#1851_Constitution|constitutional convention]], voters approved a new [[constitution]] that included provisions requiring a "thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the State."<ref name="sconet090131">{{cite press release | title = Supreme Court Upholds Constitutionality of State Law Authorizing Charter Schools | publisher = The Supreme Court of Ohio | date = 2006-10-25 | curly = y | url = http://www.supremecourtofohio.gov/Communications_Office/summaries/2006/1025/041668.asp | accessdate = 2009-01-31}}</ref>

Historically, Ohio's public schools have been funded with a combination of local [[property tax]] revenue and money from the state.<ref name="blueribbonreport">{{cite study | curly = y | url = http://www.blueribbontaskforce.ohio.gov/02022005brtf.pdf | title = Building a Better School Funding System | accessdate = 2009-01-31 | year = 2005 | month = February | format = PDF | publisher = The Governor's Blue Ribbon Task Force on Financing Student Success | pages = 60}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This led to [[Social inequality|disparities]] in the quality of education in more affluent districts, where high property values led to greater funding, and urban and rural districts,<ref name="pd070323"/> where low property values left students with funding shortfalls and dilapidated facilities.<ref name="rutgers">{{cite web | curly = y | url = http://ielp.rutgers.edu/resources/Ohio | title = IELP Resources: Ohio | accessdate = 2009-01-31 | publisher = Institute on Education Law and Policy | location = Newark, N.J.}}</ref>

Funding became even more difficult for districts in 1976, when House Bill 920 went into effect, essentially freezing the revenue from property taxes. A millage tax would usually generate more revenue as the value of property in a district increased, but HB 920 required county [[auditor]]s to cut the tax rate so it would bring in the same amount of revenue each year. Even as [[inflation]] increased costs for schools, their revenue could not keep up, forcing them to ask voters to approve new [[Tax|levies]] every few years.<ref name="blueribbonreport"/>

Over the next 30 years, the state's school districts would send nearly 10,000 levies to the ballot.<ref name="pd090129">{{cite news | first = Edith | last = Starzyk | title = Gov.

Districts in both poor and affluent areas found the funding system unsustainable, and in 1988, [[Superintendent (education)|superintendents]] from districts in underfunded areas in [[Appalachian Ohio|southeast Ohio]] formed the Coalition of Rural and Appalachian Schools to work together to address the problem. Lacking the funding to mount a serious legal challenge, they invited districts from around the state to join a new coalition: The Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding.<ref name="blade010617">{{cite news | first = Drew | last = James | title = Coalition legal fees $3.6M and growing Ohio taxpayers foot bills for Columbus firm's work | curly = y | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/artikkel?SearchID=73065440499531&Avis=TO&Dato=20010617&Kategori=NEWS24&Lopenr=106170038 | work = The Toledo Blade | location = Toledo, Ohio | date = 2001-06-17 | accessdate = 2009-01-312009-01-31}}</ref>

The coalition, a [[council of governments]] representing nearly every school district in the state, formed in 1991 and filed a complaint in the [[Perry County, Ohio|Perry County]] [[Ohio Courts of Common Pleas|Court of Common Pleas]] on [[December 19]], 1991, on behalf of [[Nathan DeRolph]], a 15-year-old [[freshman]] at [[Sheridan High School (Thornville, Ohio)|Sheridan High School]], and 550 school districts in the state.<ref name="blade010617"/> Represented by [[Bricker & Eckler|Bricker & Eckler LLP]], the coalition named the state, the [[Ohio Board of Education]], its superintendent, and the [[Ohio Department of Education]] as [[plaintiff]]s in the suit, which alleged that the funding system did not meet the constitutional standard for thoroughness or efficiency, and presented an exhaustive body of evidence demonstrating that the system produced unequal, inefficient and inadequate results.<ref name="uakronstudy">{{cite study | curly = y | url = http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID461023_code031031570.pdf?abstractid=461023&mirid=1 | title = At the Intersection of Public Policy and Private Process: Court-Ordered Mediation and the Remedial Process in School Funding Litigation | accessdate = 2009-01-31 | last = O'Brien | first = Molly T. | year = 2003 | month = October | format = PDF | work = Public Law & Legal Theory Working Paper Series, [[University of Akron]] School of Law | publisher = [[Social Science Research Network]] | pages = 49 | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.461023}}</ref>

The allegations went mostly unchallenged by the state, which in fact produced its own witnesses to testify to the inadequacy of the funding system. The case produced a 30-day trial, a transcript more than 5,600 pages long and 450 exhibits before the trial judge, [[Linton D. Lewis, Jr.]], ruled on July 1, 1994, that Ohioans had a fundamental right to an state-funded education and that the state<U+2019>s system for providing that education was unconstitutional. Further, he ordered the board of education to devise a means for the [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assembly]] to eliminate wealth-based disparities in education.<ref name="uakronstudy"/>

Although the board voted not to appeal, the [[Ohio Attorney General|attorney general<U+2019>s office]], which represents the state, filed a notice of appeal to the Fifth District [[Ohio District Courts of Appeal |Court of Appeals]], based in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]].<ref name="uakronstudy"/> The appeals court<U+2019>s 2-1 decision, handed down on August 30, 1995, held that a previous ruling by the state supreme court permitted disparities in education, so long as the state provided for a basic education.<ref name="rightforohiotimeline">{{cite web | curly = y | url = http://www.rightforohio.com/derolph.php#timeline | title = 10th Anniversary of DeRolph v.

Two months later, the coalition appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]].<ref name="rightforohiotimeline"/>

===Prologue===
In the days before the court heard the case, there was uncertainty on both sides as to how the justices would rule. The justices could be pigeonholed on certain issues, but on education, their leanings were harder to categorize. [[Ohio Senate|Senate]] [[President pro tempore|President Pro Tempore]] [[Richard Finan]] said that a ruling for the plaintiffs would be a "worst-case scenario" for the legislature because any solution put forward would be challenged as well, while [[William L. Phillis]], the director of the coalition, cast the decision as one between educating children for a rapidly evolving world or letting them fall behind.<ref name="plaindealer960909">{{cite news | first = T.C. | last = Brown | coauthors = Joe Hallett | title = Court's leaning hard to predict; justices to decide if school funding is fair | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Plain Dealer]] | publisher = | location = [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1996-09-09}}</ref>

The case reached the Ohio Supreme Court on September 10, 1996. [[Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court|Chief Justice]] [[Thomas Moyer]] tripled the length of oral arguments by letting each side present for 90 minutes.<ref name="dispatch070318">{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Hallett | authorlink = [[Joe Hallett]] | title = What went on in the Supreme Court | url= http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/03/18/20070318-A1-00.html | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | date = 2007-03-18 | accessdate = 2009-01-31}}</ref> Bricker's [[Nicholas A. Pittner]] argued for the schools, while [[Solicitor General of Ohio|Solicitor General]] [[Jeffrey Sutton]] defended the state.<ref name="dispatch960908">{{cite news | first = Lee | last = Leonard | title = School funding case to open in high court | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1C | date = 1996-09-08}}</ref>

Pittner reiterated arguments that unequal funding and dilapidated buildings left some students with less opportunity than others. Sutton conceded that there were problems with the system, but he argued that they should be fixed locally, not by the court. He said that the state constitution guaranteed students an education for free, not the best possible education for free.<ref name="daytondailynews960911">{{cite news | first = Lynn | last = Hulsey | authorlink = | coauthors = Tim Miller | title = School funding: Court hears arguments | curly = y | url = | work = [[Dayton Daily News]] | publisher = | location = [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1996-09-11}}</ref>

Justices peppered both sides with questions, asking whether anyone should be held to account for funding inadequacies and focusing also on school facilities around the state, which Pittner noted were sometimes in such poor condition that they didn't even meet the state's minimum standards for a humane prison.<ref name="dispatch960908" /><ref name="daytondailynews960911" />

===The decision===
By the time the [[Associate Justice|justices]] adjourned to deliberate, two justices, [[Andrew Douglas]] and [[Paul Pfeifer]], had decided that the funding system was unconstitutional and needed to be changed. Meanwhile, Justice [[Deborah L. Cook]] was adamant that the court should not be involved in school funding decisions and "never budged from that position," though neither side had made that claim.<ref name="dispatch070318">{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Hallett | authorlink = [[Joe Hallett]] | title = What went on in the Supreme Court | url= http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/03/18/20070318-A1-00.html | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | date = 2007-03-18 | accessdate = 2009-01-31}}</ref>

A majority emerged among Justices Douglas, Pfeifer, [[Alice Robie Resnick]], and [[Francis E. Sweeney, Sr.]] Meanwhile, Chief Justice Moyer and Justice [[Evelyn Lundberg Stratton]] indicated they were likely to join Cook, but they expressed more flexibility depending on the language of the majority [[Legal opinion|opinion]], which was randomly assigned to Sweeney. Although formal deliberations had only lasted about a half-hour, the justices continued to discuss the case one-on-one, as Sweeney tried to coax Moyer and Stratton into the majority.<ref name="dispatch070318" />

But in the end, the decision was carried by the narrow, 4-3 majority that emerged after oral arguments. The March 24, 1997, ruling:

*found the funding scheme for elementary and secondary education to be unconstitutional;
*ordered an end to the "school foundation program" and the reliance on property taxes for school funding;
*provided the state 12 months to solve the problem;
*awarded [[attorney's fee]]s to the plaintiffs; and
*remanded the case to the trial judge.<ref>{{cite news | title = The decision in brief | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | publisher = | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-03-25}}</ref>

Resnick, Pfeifer and Douglas each wrote separate concurring opinions. For the minority, Moyer's [[Dissenting opinion|dissent]] acknowledged problems with school funding but questioned whether they actually violated the state constitution<ref name="dispatch970325a">{{cite news | first = Duane | last = St. Clair | title = 4-3 ruling ends fight begun in '91 | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-03-25}}</ref> and argued that they were matters for the legislature to handle.<ref name="dispatch070318" />

===Reaction===
The next day, [[Governor of Ohio|Gov.]] [[George Voinovich]], Senate President [[Richard H. Finan]] and House Speaker [[Jo Ann Davidson]] called a [[news conference|press conference]] to denounce the ruling. Voinovich suggested that his [[Administration (government)|administration]] might defy the decision,<ref name="dispatch070318" /> and he classified the ruling as "[[judicial activism]]" and "a thinly veiled call for a massive, multi-billion tax increase."<ref name="daytondailynews970326">{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Miller | title = Voinovich lashes edict | curly = y | url = | work = [[Dayton Daily News]] | location = [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-03-26}}</ref>

[[Editorial board]]s at the largest papers in the state joined in <U+2014> perhaps prodded by the governor's aides<ref name="dispatch070318" /> <U+2014> arguing that the decision put too much power in the hands of an unknown rural judge,<ref name="enquirer970325">{{cite news | title = Wrong branch of government | curly = y | url = http://www.aproundtable.org/library/articles/dissenting/media2.html | work = [[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | location = [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] | date = 1997-03-25}}</ref> echoing complaints by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] lawmakers.<ref>{{cite news | first = Joe | last = Hallett | title = School ruling furor begins to settle down | curly = y | work = [[The Plain Dealer]] | location = [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-03-30}}</ref> [[The Plain Dealer]] wrote that "almost any other outcome would have been preferable."<ref>{{cite news | title = Now what?

The next week, the state filed a [[reconsider|motion to reconsider]], asking the court (1) whether property taxes could still be used to fund schools at all; (2) whether school funding debts remained valid even though repayment provisions extended beyond the court's deadline to find a new funding system; and (3) to retain [[jurisdiction]] over the case instead of sending it back to the trial court.<ref>{{cite news | first = Catherine | last = Candinsky | title = Guidance asked on school ruling | curly = y | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-04-04}}</ref> The coalition opposed the motion, saying that the ruling was clear enough and that the state needed to instead get about the business of providing additional funding.<ref>{{cite news | first = James | last = Bradshaw | title = School ruling needs no clarification, coalition says | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 2C | date = 1997-04-11}}</ref>

Later that month, the court issued a ruling clarifying that property taxes could still be used if they were not the primary revenue source for school funding; that debts remained valid; and that the case would return to the trial judge, but that appeals of his decision would bypass the Court of Appeals and go directly back to the Ohio Supreme Court.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tim | last = Miller | title = Court returns case to judge | curly = y | url = | work = [[Dayton Daily News]] | location = [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1B | date = 1997-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Lee | last = Leonard | title = Judge keeps school-funding case; school loans can go ahead | curly = y | url = | work = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | location = [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] | page = 1A | date = 1997-04-26}}</ref>
