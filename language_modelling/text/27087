'''Christopher John "Chris" Killen''' (born 8 October 1981 in [[Wellington]]) is a [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand international]]<ref name="aapp">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/NZRepSoccer/id1708.htm|title=A-International Appearances - Overall|author=|publisher=The Ultimate New Zealand Soccer Website|date=|accessdate=3 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="agoal">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/NZRepSoccer/id1842.htm|title=A-International Scorers - Overall|author=|publisher=The Ultimate New Zealand Soccer Website|date=|accessdate=3 June 2009}}</ref> [[Association football|footballer]] who currently plays for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Killen grew up in the Wellington suburb of [[Island Bay, Wellington|Island Bay]]. As a youth he attended [[Rongotai College]], the same school as New Zealand football great [[Wynton Rufer]]. Killen also played for [[Miramar Rangers]], whose coach arranged a trial with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>{{cite news

| url = http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=220382006
| publisher = Scotland on Sunday
| accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref> The trial was successful, and the 17 year old Killen joined City's youth academy. His first senior club appearances came during a loan spell at [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] in September 2000. He scored his first league goal on 9 September 2000 against Oldham,<ref>{{cite news

| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/916118.stm
| publisher = BBC
| accessdate = 2007-11-02}}</ref> and in total scored three goals in nine appearances for the [[Wales|Welsh]] club. The following season he was loaned to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], scoring six goals in nine league games. In November 2001 he was recalled from loan as a number of Manchester City strikers were injured, and was a substitute in a 2<U+2013>1 win against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]].<ref>{{cite news

===Oldham Athletic===

He joined [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in July 2002<ref name="Oldham transfer">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/o/oldham_athletic/2161092.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Killen for Oldham|date=2002-07-30}}</ref> for <U+00A3>250,000. He remained with Oldham for 3 and a half years, scoring 24 goals in 78 league appearances. Failing to match his price tag and seemingly high wage through continuous injury, Oldham no longer required his services and released him on a free transfer.

===Hibernian===
In January 2006, Killen joined [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]].<ref name="Hibs transfer.">{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411317/654394|publisher=TVNZ ONE Sport|title=All White signs for Hibs|date=2006-01-27 }}</ref> He scored on his debut as he netted the third goal in Hibs' 3&ndash;0 defeat of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in the [[Scottish Cup]] 4th round in February 2006.<ref name="3-0 Rangers">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/4676068.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Rangers 0&ndash;3 Hibernian|date=2006-02-04}}</ref> 
His first home goal was the opener in a 7&ndash;0 win against [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] four days later.<ref name="7-0 Livi">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4689666.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Hibernian 7&ndash;0 Livingston|date=2006-02-08}}</ref> Despite arriving in January, he had scored five goals for Hibs by the end of the season. He also scored the opening goal of Hibs 5&ndash;0 defeat of Latvia's [[Dinaburg FC|Dinaburg]] in the [[Intertoto Cup]] second round game at [[Easter Road]] on 2 July 2006.<ref name="Hibernian 5-0 Dinaburg">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/5133742.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Hibernian 5&ndash;0 Dinaburg Daugavpils|date=2006-07-02}}</ref>.
 
Following the departure of strikers [[Garry O'Connor]] and [[Derek Riordan]], Killen was expected to be an important player for Hibs in [[2006-07 in Scottish football|2006&ndash;07]]. By December 2006 he had scored 11 goals, including two in a 2&ndash;1 win over Rangers.<ref name="2-1 Rangers">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/5345670.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Hibernian 2&ndash;1 Rangers|date=2006-09-17}}</ref> A ruptured achilles suffered in a 2&ndash;2 draw with Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup tie prematurely ended his season in January. Killen's contract with Hibernian expired in the summer of 2007, and he rejected the offer of a one-year extension from the [[Edinburgh]] club. 

===Celtic===
Killen was expected to sign for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]],<ref name="Cardiff">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/cardiff_city/6698117.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Killen closes on Bluebirds move|date=2007-05-28}}</ref> but he instead signed for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on a three year contract.<ref name="Celtic">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/6706603.stm| publisher=BBC Sport website| title=Celtic in surprise Killen swoop| date=2007-05-30}}</ref> Killen made his debut on 5 August 2007, coming off the bench in a goalless draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at [[Celtic Park]]. His first goal for the club came on 7 October at [[Fir Park]]; with Celtic trailing 1&ndash;0 to {{fc|Gretna}}, Killen equalised in the 89th minute before [[Scott McDonald]] scored the winner for Celtic in stoppage time. He made his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut for Celtic at the [[Est<U+00E1>dio da Luz]] against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] on 24 October.

After that, however, he found chances hard to come by as he found himself behind [[Scott McDonald]], [[Georgios Samaras]] and [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]] in selection. Killen played mostly for the Celtic [[reserve team]], but he scored a goal against {{fc|Southampton}} in a pre-season friendly in May 2008. He hardly featured in the first team at all, leading to him being loaned out to [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. At the end of the 2008&ndash;09 season, however, manager [[Gordon Strachan]] resigned from his position, and Celtic replaced him with [[Tony Mowbray]], who had previously managed Killen at [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].

Killen's hopes of regaining a first team place at Celtic for the 2009&ndash;10 season were boosted in pre-season [[friendly match]]es, as he scored two goals against [[Brisbane Roar]]<ref name="Hoops too good for Roar">{{cite news
| title = Hoops too good for Roar

Killen then started Celtic's following preseason match against [[Tottenham Hotspur FC|Spurs]], and he opened the scoring in this match with a neat headed finish following a cross by defender [[Paul Caddis]]. Killen scored his first league goal at [[Celtic Park]] on 20 September, Celtic's first goal in a 2&ndash;1 win against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]].

===Norwich City===
On 31 January, 2009 Killen joined [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on loan for the remainder of the [[Norwich City F.C. season 2008<U+2013>09|2008&ndash;09]] season.<ref name="Norwich secure Killen loan deal">{{cite news

==International career==
Killen made his international debut for [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]] during the [[2000 OFC Nations Cup]] against [[Tahiti national football team|Tahiti]],<ref name="alup">{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatenzsoccer.com/NZRepSoccer/id1565.htm|title=A-International Lineups|author=|publisher=The Ultimate New Zealand Soccer Website|date=|accessdate=4 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

Killen was included in the New Zealand U-23 squad for their first appearance at the [[2008 Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] as one of 3 over age players, alongside [[Ryan Nelsen]] and [[Simon Elliott]]<ref>{{cite news|title = Olympic Football Squads Named

He was named as part of the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] New Zealand squad to travel to South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oceaniafootball.com/ofcnewsdetails/new-zealand---all-whites-name-squad-for-fifa-confederations-cup|title=New Zealand - All Whites name Confederations Cup squad|author=|publisher=Oceania Football confederation|date=7 May 2009|accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/teams/team=43978/squadlist.html|title=2009 Confederations Cup - New Zealand squad|author=|publisher=FIFA.com|date=|accessdate=9 June 2009}}</ref> Killen scored twice in their final warm up game, a 4&ndash;3 defeat against [[2006 FIFA World Cup|world champions]] [[Italy national football team|Italy]].
