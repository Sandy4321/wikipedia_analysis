'''''Resolution''''' was an early [[beam engine]], installed between 1781<U+2013>1782 at [[Coalbrookdale]] as a [[water-returning engine]] to power the blast furnaces and [[Coalbrookdale Museum of Iron|ironworks]] there. It was one of the last water-returning engines to be constructed, before the [[rotative beam engine]] made this type of engine obsolete.

[[Coalbrookdale]] was a cradle of the [[First Industrial Revolution]] and was the scene of [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]]'s first production of iron by a [[coke (fuel)|coke]]-fired [[blast furnace]], rather than the previous and expensive [[charcoal]]. Coalbrookdale is a narrow steep-sided valley that offered useful water power to drive the [[cold blast|furnace blast]] and the various [[stamp mill]]s, [[boring (manufacturing)|boring engine]]s, etc. Contemporary visitors commented upon the [[picturesque]] 'fine cascades' of water.<ref name="Coalbrookdale 1801" >{{Citation

A simple method to extend the water availability was to construct a series of ponds high in the valley.<ref >{{Cite journal

From 1735, the Coalbrookdale Company under [[Abraham Darby II]] attempted to reduce their dependency upon seasonal water supply by a series of water-returning engines. These engines did not drive the ironworks machinery directly, but pumped water from the lower to upper ponds to recycle it. The first of these engines was [[horse gin|horse-worked]] in around 1735, then replaced by a [[Newcomen engine]] in 1742<U+2013>1743.<ref >{{harvnb|Belford|2007|pages=136}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Newcomen engines were recognised as expensive in their coal consumption and were replaced in most situations other than coal mines, where waste slack could be used. At Coalbrookdale, the steam engines were fired with high quality coal, possibly the same grade of metallurgical coal as used in the blast furnaces. This continued until the recession of 1830, when [[Abraham Darby IV|Abraham IV]] and [[Alfred Darby]] saved 600 tons of high quality coal by switching the works to using only low-quality coal for boilers.<ref>{{harvnb|Trinder|1974|page=49}}</ref>

To increase the water pumping capacity, and to reduce the amount of coal consumed, in 1781 [[Abraham Darby III]] replaced the existing Newcomen engine with ''Resolution'', one of the recently developed, and more efficient, [[Watt engine]]s.<ref name="Belford, 136" >{{harvnb|Belford|2007|page=136}}</ref>

This cylinder was [[single-acting cylinder|single-acting]] and worked on [[Newcomen engine|Newcomen's atmospheric principle]], although improved by [[Watt's separate condenser]]. Its boiler was of Watt's [[wagon boiler|wagon style]] and was 22 feet in diameter.<ref name="Coalbrookdale 1801" /><ref name="Shropshire, Site" /> The [[beam (beam engine)|beam]] was wooden, but as the engine was so large it was made from multiple laminated timbers, as was becoming common around this time for the increasingly large and powerful engines. At each end it was fitted with an iron-shod wooden arch head, with the engine's force transmitted by a pair of chains.

The name ''Resolution'' was a reference to [[Captain Cook]]'s recent [[Third voyage of James Cook|South Seas voyages]] aboard {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}}.

''Resolution'' was outdated in some ways shortly after it was delivered. In 1782, Watt developed a further two of his major innovations in the steam engine: [[double-acting cylinder|double-acting]] engines and the [[rotative beam engine]].<ref>{{cite book

''Resolution'' was installed at the head of Coalbrookdale, between the header ponds of the Upper Furnace Pool and the New Pool.<ref name="Shropshire, Site" /><ref name="Belford, 137" >{{harvnb|Belford|2007|page=137}}</ref> This site was further up the valley than that of the preceding Newcomen engine, which had been sited at what is now the large Wesleyan chapel on the main road.<ref name="Belford, 137" /> The older engine had supplied the Lower Furnace Pool. The New Pool was constructed long before, around 1698, but only acted as an additional reservoir to the Upper Furnace Pool and did not supply any waterwheels or equipment directly.<ref name="Belford, 138" >{{harvnb|Belford|2007|page=138}}</ref> There was thus no advantage in pumping water back to its extra height and so ''Resolution'' supplied the Upper Furnace Pool, although by a short mill-race that also supplied a corn-mill.<ref name="Belford, 138" /><ref>Plan accompanying the Lease of Coal-brookdale Ironworks (1805), Shropshire Archives 1681/138/1.</ref>

Pumping engines of this vintage used a vertical pump rod, with a [[bucket pump]] at the bottom of the shaft. This could lift water from an appreciable depth, developed for the needs of Cornish tin mining, but they had only low delivery pressure at the top of the shaft. The engine was thus placed near to where the water was to be delivered, rather than its source.

The source of the returned water was one of the lower ponds, the Boring Mill Pool. This was enlarged to provide a greater reservoir capacity, around the time this engine was installed.<ref name="Belford, 136"/> From here an underground passageway was dug, 0.8&nbsp;km long to the engine house pump. Although this was heading ''up'' the dale, the passage had a slight fall to the North, to encourage the water flow. At the pump shaft, the shaft was now {{convert|120|ft|m}} deep.<ref name="Belford, 136" /> This tunnel was just one of a number of culverts, sluices and similar works built at the Coalbrookdale site around this time.<ref name="Belford, culverts" >{{harvnb|Belford|2007|page=138<U+2013>143}}</ref>

The engine had a working life of just less than forty years. By 1821 the engine house was painted as being in a semi-demolished state.<ref name="J Homes Smith" />
