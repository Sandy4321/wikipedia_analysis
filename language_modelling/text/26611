==The Great Fire of 2006==
On March 23, 2006, suspects entered Caldwell High School and set fire to the Chemistry lab. The room was a loss.  Prior to the fire, the school had recently installed an extensive security camera system, including one directly outside of the room. Following the incident, the school was cited for having not completed the recommended amount of fire drills per year and having non-working fire alarm systems. Also following the fire, school closed for 3 days and finally reopened smelling of smoke and burning cherry blossoms. Even though the scent was supposed to not make anyone sick, it did. Students were relocated to another classroom where they can be quoted as saying "we had a grand time learning about chemistry".
