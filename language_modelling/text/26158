The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is one of the four [[big cat]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]'' and a member of the family [[Felidae]]. With some males exceeding {{convert|250|kg|abbr=on}} in weight,<ref name = "nowak"/> it is the second-largest living cat after the [[tiger]]. Wild lions currently exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[Asia]] (where an [[endangered]] remnant population resides in [[Gir Forest National Park]] in [[India]]) while other types of lions have disappeared from [[North Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]] in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]], about 10,000&nbsp;years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the [[Yukon]] to [[Peru]].<ref name=Harington69/> The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30<U+2013>50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=IUCN/> Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the [[West African lion]] population is particularly endangered.

Lions live for 10<U+2013>14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian South Africa (Publishers)(Pty.)

Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. Lions are [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]], although they scavenge as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so.

Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human [[culture]]. Depictions have existed from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, with carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since the time of the [[Roman Empire]], and have been a key species sought for exhibition in [[zoo]]s over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic subspecies]].

==Etymology==
The lion's name, similar in many [[Romance languages]], is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|leo}}'';<ref>{{Cite book| author=Simpson, D.P. | title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher=Cassell Ltd. | year=1979 | edition=5th | location=London | page=342 | isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> and the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03C9><U+03BD>}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|leon}}'').<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{Cite book| author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]] | year=1980 | title=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition)|page=411 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|<U+05DC><U+05B8><U+05D1><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05D0>}} ({{lang|he-Latn|''lavi''}}) may also be related.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| title=Lion|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Simpson, John; Weiner, Edmund| year=1989 |edition= 2nd| location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press| isbn=0-19-861186-2}}</ref> It was one of the species originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], who gave it the name ''Felis leo'', in his eighteenth-century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref name="Linn1758">{{Cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |page=41 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726936 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |language=Latin |volume=1 |edition=10th}}</ref>

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'': the [[tiger]], the [[jaguar]], and the [[leopard]]. ''P. leo'' evolved in [[Africa]] between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the [[Holarctic]] region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1= Yamaguchi |first1=Nobuyuki| last2=Cooper |first2=Alan |last3=Werdelin |first3= Lars |last4= Macdonald |first4=David W.|year=2004 |month=August |title= Evolution of the mane and group-living in the lion (''Panthera leo''): a review|journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=263 |issue=4 |pages=329<U+2013>42 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005242 }}</ref> It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies ''[[Panthera leo fossilis]]'' at [[Isernia]] in [[Italy]].

===Subspecies===
Traditionally, 12 recent [[subspecies]] of lion were recognised, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.<ref name = "zoos_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Grisham | first= Jack | editor-first = Catherine E | editor-last = Bell |title=Lion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=2: G<U+2013>P |year=2001 | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chofago |isbn=1-57958-174-9 |pages=733<U+2013>39}}</ref> Today, only eight subspecies are usually accepted,<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny">{{Cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = Joachim |year= 2004 |title= Molecular phylogeny of the extinct cave lion ''Panthera leo spelaea'' | journal= [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] | pmid= 15012963 | volume = 30 | issue =3 |pages=841<U+2013>49 |doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.020 | url= http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Biologie/Anthropologie/MolA/Download/Burger%202004.pdf | type = fulltext | accessdate= 20 September 2007 | last3 = Loreille | first3 = Odile | last4 = Hemmer | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Eriksson | first5 = Torsten | last6 = G<U+00F6>therstr<U+00F6>m | first6 = Anders | last7 = Hiller | first7 = Jennifer | last8 = Collins | first8 = Matthew J. | last9 = Wess | first9 = Timothy}}</ref><ref name = "CG" /> although one of these, the [[Cape lion]], formerly described as ''Panthera leo melanochaita'', is probably invalid.<ref name="CG" />  Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many. While the status of the Asiatic lion (''P. l. persica'') as a subspecies is generally accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. [[Mitochondria]]l variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies, therefore all sub-Saharan lions sometimes have been considered a single subspecies, however, a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, [[Western African lion]]s are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa and a subsequent recolonization of these parts from Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertola | year = 2011 | title = Genetic diversity, evolutionary history and implications for conservation of the lion (''Panthera leo'') in West and Central Africa | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1356<U+2013>67 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02500.x | first1 = L.

By far most lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the [[International Species Information System]] are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes which are extinct in the wild, and might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion.<ref name="CG"/> It is believed that those lions, imported to Europe before the middle of the nineteenth century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barnett | first1 = Ross | last2 = Yamaguchi | first2 = Nobuyuki | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = Beth | last4 = Nijman | first4 = Vincent | year = 2007 | title = Using ancient DNA techniques to identify the origin of unprovenanced museum specimens, as illustrated by the identification of a 19th century lion from Amsterdam | url = http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/get-pdf?c=ctz;idno=7602a02 | journal = Contributions to Zoology | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 87<U+2013>94}}</ref>

Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting in the ancient world.

Lions have been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Siberian Tiger|Siberian]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tiglon]]s (or tigons).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guggisberg |first=Charles Albert Walter |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=1975 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-8008-8324-1 }}</ref> They also have been crossed with [[leopards]] to produce [[leopon]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Doi H, Reynolds B |title=The Story of Leopons |year=1967 |publisher=Putnam |location=New York |oclc=469041 <!--Too old for ISBN-->}}</ref> and [[jaguar]]s to produce [[Panthera hybrid#Jaglion|jaglions]]. The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese spotted lion]] is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in [[China]].

The '''liger''' is a cross between a male lion and a tigress.<ref name="liger">{{Cite book| last=Markel |first=Scott| coauthors= Darryl Le<U+00F3>n| year= 2003 |title=Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell: a guide to common tools and databases | publisher= O'Reily |location=Sebastopol, California |isbn=0-596-00494-X}}</ref> Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow them, their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.

Ligers are much bigger than normal lions, typically 3.0 to 3.7&nbsp;m (10 to 12 feet) in length, and can weigh 360 to 450&nbsp;kg (800 to 1,000 pounds).<ref name="liger" />

The less common '''tiglon''' or '''tigon''' is a cross between a lioness and a male tiger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/595552/tigon|title= Tigon<U+2014>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Article|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> In contrast to ligers, tigons are often relatively small in comparison to their parents, because of reciprocal gene effects.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shi, Wei|year=2005|title=Growth and Behviour: Epigenetic and Genetic Factors Involved in Hybrid Dysgenesis|work=Digital Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology|volume=11|page=9|isbn=91-554-6147-6|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-4784|publisher=Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis|location=Uppsala}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Lion and eland.jpg|thumb|left|A skeletal mount of an African Lion attacking a [[Common Eland]] on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]

The lion is the tallest (at the shoulder) of all living cats, averaging approximately {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} taller than the [[tiger]]. Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.<ref name="USSR">{{Cite book| author = Heptner, V.G; Sludskii, A.A. | title = Mammals of the Soviet Union, Volume II, Part 2 | year = 1992| isbn = 90-04-08876-8 | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden u.a.}}</ref> Lion coloration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown [[Rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.

Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious [[sexual dimorphism]] <U+2013> that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older.

[[File:HansomeLion 002.jpg|thumb|right|During confrontations with others, the mane makes the lion look larger]]
Weights for adult lions range between 150<U+2013>250&nbsp;kg (330<U+2013>550&nbsp;lb) for males and 120<U+2013>182&nbsp;kg (264<U+2013>400&nbsp;lb) for females.<ref name="nowak">{{Cite book|last=Nowak |first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> Nowell and Jackson report average weights of {{convert|181|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|126|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females.<ref name="CAP"/> Lions tend to vary in size depending on their environment and area, resulting in a wide spread in recorded weights. For instance, lions in [[southern Africa]], tend, in general, to be approximately 5% heavier than those in [[East Africa]].<ref>[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 80.</ref>

Head and body length is 170<U+2013>250&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in&nbsp;<U+2013> 8&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in) in males and 140<U+2013>175&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in <U+2013> 5&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in) in females; shoulder height is up to 123&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;ft) in males and as low as 91&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft) in females.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100525220301/http://www.carnivoreconservationmalawi.org/carnivores.html Carnivore].

The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5&nbsp;mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail <U+2013> the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5<U+00BD>&nbsp;months of age and is readily identifiable at 7&nbsp;months.<ref name="Schaller28">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 28.</ref>

===Mane===
The mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It makes the lion appear larger, providing an excellent intimidation display; this aids the lion during confrontations with other lions and with the species' chief competitor in Africa, the [[spotted hyena]].<ref>

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary lion]] and [[Cape lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the colour and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[room temperature|ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, may result in a heavier mane.

===White lions===
[[File:White Lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[White lion]]s owe their colouring to a recessive gene; they are rare forms of the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'']]
The [[white lion]] is not a distinct subspecies, but a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition, [[leucism]],<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> that causes paler colouration akin to that of the [[white tiger]]; the condition is similar to [[melanism]], which causes [[black panther]]s. They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion (''Panthera leo krugeri'') individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Panthera leo stretching (Etosha, 2012).jpg|thumbnail|left|Adult male lion of the Okondeka pride stretching in [[Etosha National Park]]]]
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 122.</ref> Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 120<U+2013>21.</ref>

===Group organization===
[[File:pride leader.jpg|thumb|right|Two lionesses and a mature male of a pride, northern Serengeti]]
[[File:Lions Family Portrait Masai Mara.jpg|thumb|right|Two males and a female in Masai Mara, southwest Kenya]]
Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild [[felid]]s, most of which remain quite solitary in nature. The lion is a predatory [[carnivore]] with two types of social organization. Some lions are ''residents,'' living in groups centering around related lionesses, called ''prides''.<ref name="Schaller33">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 33.</ref> The pride usually consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a ''coalition'' if more than one) who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two, but may increase to four and decrease again over time. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity.

The second organizational behaviour is labeled ''nomads'', who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name="Schaller33"/> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males have to go through this lifestyle and some never are able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.

The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name="Schaller33"/> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their [[territory (animal)|territory]]. Why [[social behavior|sociality]] <U+2013> the most pronounced in any cat species <U+2013> has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation, but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake, however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/>

[[File:Lion.ogv|thumb|right|Video of a wild lioness]]
Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride. They are more effective hunters as they are smaller, swifter and more agile than the males, and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills,<ref name="Schaller133">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 133.</ref> although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible. If near the conclusion of the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses, but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves.

Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build.<ref>[http://www.lionconservationfund.org/lion_adopt.html Join the Pride]. Lion Conservation Fund. Retrieved on 2013-07-31.</ref> Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heinsohn|first= R. |coauthors= C.

===Hunting and diet===
[[File:Lion Serengeti.JPG|thumb|Lioness roars in [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], Tanzania]]
[[File:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|While a lioness such as this one has very sharp teeth, prey is usually killed by strangulation]]
The lioness is the one who does the hunting for the pride.  The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches its young while waiting for the lionesses to return from the hunt. Typically, several lionesses work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by [[strangulation]],<ref>{{cite web | title = About lions<U+2014>Ecology and behaviour | first = Gus | last = Mills | publisher = African Lion Working Group | url= http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2007}}</ref> which can cause [[cerebral ischemia]] or [[asphyxia]] (which results in [[hypoxemia|hypoxemic]], or "general", [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia).  Smaller prey, though, may simply be killed by a swipe of a lion's paw.<ref name="nowak" />

Lions are powerful animals that usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina <U+2013> for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight.<ref>[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 248.</ref> Thus, they only run fast in short bursts,<ref name="Schaller2478">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 247<U+2013>48.</ref> and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack.  They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name="Schaller237">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 237.</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately 30<U+202F>metres (98&nbsp;ft) or less.

[[File:Serengeti Lion Running saturated.jpg|thumb|left|Lioness in a burst of speed while hunting in the Serengeti]]
The [[predation|prey]] consists mainly of large mammals, with a preference for [[wildebeest]], [[zebra]]s, [[African Buffalo|buffalo]], and [[warthog]]s in Africa and [[nilgai]], [[boar|wild boar]], and several [[deer]] species in India. Many other species are hunted, based on availability. Mainly this will include [[ungulate]]s weighing between 50 and 300&nbsp;kg (110<U+2013>660&nbsp;lb) such as [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]], and [[taurotragus|eland]].<ref name="nowak" /> Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as [[Thomson's gazelle]] or [[springbok (antelope)|springbok]]. Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male [[giraffe]]s due to the danger of injury.

Extensive statistics collected over various studies show that lions normally feed on mammals in the range 190<U+2013>550&nbsp;kg (420<U+2013>1210&nbsp;lb). In Africa, wildebeest rank at the top of preferred prey (making nearly half of the lion prey in the [[Serengeti]]) followed by zebra.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn=888095752X | title = The Art of Being a Lion | page = 186 | first1 = Christine |  last1 = Denis-Huot | first2 = Michel | last2 = Denis-Huot | publisher = Friedman/Fairfax | year = 2002 }}</ref>  Most adult [[hippopotamus]]es, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, and smaller [[gazelle]]s, [[impala]], and other agile antelopes are generally excluded.

Lions also attack domestic livestock; in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet.<ref name = "Menon" /> Lions are capable of killing other predators such as [[leopard]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[African Wild Dog|wild dogs]], though (unlike most felids) they seldom devour the competitors after killing them.  They also scavenge animals either dead from [[natural causes]] (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress.<ref name = "Schaller213">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 213.</ref>  A lion may gorge itself and eat up to 30&nbsp;kg (66&nbsp;lb) in one sitting;<ref name="simba">{{Cite book| last= Guggisberg|first= Charles Albert Walter | title = Simba: the life of the lion. |year=1961 |publisher=Howard Timmins |location=Cape Town}}</ref> if it is unable to consume all the kill it will rest for a few hours before consuming more.

[[File:Lions taking down cape buffalo.jpg|thumb|right|Four lionesses take down a cape buffalo in the central Serengeti, Tanzania]]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by [[vulture]]s from kilometres away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Stander | first = PE | title= Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445<U+2013>54|year=1992|doi = 10.1007/BF00170175}}</ref> Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old.

====Predator competition====
[[File:Panthera leo & Crocuta crocuta.jpg|thumb|Subadult male lion and [[spotted hyena]] in the [[Masai Mara]]]]
Lions and [[spotted hyena]]s occupy the same ecological niche (and hence compete) where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.<ref name="prey">{{cite journal| url = http://www.zbs.bialowieza.pl/g2/pdf/1598.pdf | format = PDF | title= Prey preferences of the spotted hyaena (''Crocuta crocuta'') and degree of dietary overlap with the lion (''Panthera leo'')| last =Hayward | first = Matt W.| journal =Journal of Zoology |year= 2006|volume= 270|pages= 606<U+2013>14 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00183}}</ref> Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, whether there is food or not.  Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the [[Ngorongoro crater]], it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact that was proven by Dr. Hans Kruuk, who found that lions repeatedly approached him whenever he played the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding.<ref name="Kruuk21">{{Cite book |chapter = Interactions between Hyenas and other Carnivorous Animals | first = Hans | last = Kruuk | title = The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | place = Chicago | year = 1972|isbn=0226455084 }}</ref> When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30<U+2013>100<U+202F>m (100<U+2013>350&nbsp;ft) until the lions have finished.<ref name="schaller272">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 272.</ref> In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force the lions off a kill. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food involved. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason: one male lion was filmed killing two matriarch hyenas on separate occasions without eating them,<ref name="enemies">{{cite video|people=Joubert, Dereck and Joubert, Beverley |title= Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas |medium=[[DVD]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]|year= 1992}}</ref> and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in [[Etosha]].

Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah has a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 =O'Brien | first1 = Stephen J | last2 = Wildt | first2 = David E | last3 = Bush | first3 = Mitchell|year= 1986| title= The Cheetah in Genetic Peril| format = PDF | journal = Scientific American|issue= 254|pages= 68<U+2013>76| url= http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/05_library/5_3_publications/N_and_O/OBrien_et_al_1986_Cheetah_in_genetic_peril.pdf}}</ref> Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, up to 90% of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators. Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush.  Leopards also use such tactics, but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs. Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.<ref name = "Schaller293">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 293.</ref> Similarly, lions dominate [[African Wild Dog|African wild dogs]], not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Conserving the African wild dog ''Lycaon pictus''. I.

The [[Nile crocodile]] is the only [[Sympatry|sympatric]] predator (besides humans) that can singly threaten the lion. Depending on the size of the crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Lions reproduce very well in captivity.

[[File:Panthera leo -Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania -mating-8.jpg|thumb|left|Lions mating in [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], Tanzania]]
The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept.<ref name="Scott45">[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 45.</ref> The cubs themselves are born blind <U+2013> their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh 1.2<U+2013>2.1&nbsp;kg (2.6<U+2013>4.6&nbsp;lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name="Schaller143">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 143.</ref> The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.<ref name="Scott45"/>

Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.<ref name="Scott45"/> Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes <U+2013> consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.
[[File:PregnantLioness.jpg|thumb|A pregnant lioness (right)]]
In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles, and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede toward the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death while warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs,<ref name="Packpus83">{{Cite journal|author=Packer, C., Pusey, A. E. |year=1983 |month=May |title= Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males|journal= American Naturalist |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716<U+2013>28 |doi= 10.1086/284097}}</ref> perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die.

When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies <U+2013> sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.<ref>[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 46.</ref>

Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4<U+2013>5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916}}</ref> if they have not already been critically injured while defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.<ref name="Packpus83"/>

Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted.<ref>[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 68.</ref> Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members. One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact [[homosexuality in animals|homosexually]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bagemihl |first=Bruce |year=1999 |title=Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-19239-8| pages=302<U+2013>05}}</ref><ref>

Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not [[genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/>

===Man-eaters===
{{Main|Man-eater}}
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; well-publicised cases include the [[Tsavo maneaters]], where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya-Uganda Railway]] were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]] in 1898, and the 1991 [[Mfuwe]] man-eater, which killed six people in the Luangwa River Valley in [[Zambia]].<ref>{{cite web| first=Wayne |last=Hosek | title=Man-eaters of the Field Museum: Lion of Mfuwe | work=Field Museum of Natural History | publisher=Field Museum of Natural History | year=2007| url =http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/exhibits/exhibit_sites/tsavo/mfuwe.html | accessdate =16 September 2007}}</ref> In both, the hunters who killed the lions wrote books detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The Mfuwe and Tsavo incidents bear similarities: the lions in both incidents were larger than normal, lacked manes, and seemed to suffer from tooth decay (although only one of the Tsavo man-eaters did). The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that, while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |coauthors=Ellis J.

In their analysis of Tsavo and man-eating generally, Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating, but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030031426/http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2007 |last=Peterhans |first=Julian C.

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period <U+2013> a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref name="Packer05">{{Cite journal|last=Packer |first=C. |coauthors=Ikanda, D.; Kissui, B.; Kushnir, H. |year=2005 |month=August |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927<U+2013>28 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828}}</ref> Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the [[full moon]] (when there was less moonlight) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people.<ref name="fullmoon">{{cite journal | title=Fear of Darkness, the Full Moon and the Nocturnal Ecology of African Lions | author=Packer, C | journal=[[PLoS ONE]] | year=2011 | month=July | volume=6 | issue=7 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022285 | coauthors=Swanson A, Ikanda D, Kushnir H | editor1-last=Rands | editor1-first=Sean A. | pages=e22285}}</ref>

Author Robert R. Frump wrote in ''The Man-eaters of Eden'' that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in [[South Africa]] are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=1-59228-892-8}}</ref>

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos, and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.<ref name="Packer05"/>

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004.

Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large [[abscess]] underneath a [[molar (tooth)|molar]] which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldus |first=R |year=2006|month=march |title=A man-eating lion (''Panthera leo'') from Tanzania with a toothache |journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research |volume=52 |issue= 1 |pages= 59<U+2013>62|doi=10.1007/s10344-005-0008-0}}</ref> GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but incidents in the early 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania). [[George Gilman Rushby|George Rushby]], game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in what is now [[Njombe]] district.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Rushby, George.

Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that are the core of [[zoo]] exhibits since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible.<ref name="dc81">[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 81</ref> Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,<ref>[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 82</ref> there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world.

At the ancient Egyptian cities of [[Taremu]] and [[Per-Bast]] were temples to the lioness goddesses of Egypt, [[Sekhmet]] and [[Bast (goddess)|Bast]] and at Taremu there was a temple to the son of the deity, [[Maahes]] the lion prince, where live lions were kept and allowed to roam within his temple.

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and [[elephant]]s, in particular, symbolised power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<ref>[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 24<U+2013>28.</ref>

The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive.

He designed lion enclosures for both [[Melbourne Zoo]] and Sydney's [[Taronga Zoo]], among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.<ref name="dc69">[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 69.</ref> In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of [[mesh|wire mesh]] or [[laminated glass]] instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden|Oklahoma City Zoological Park]].<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam.<ref name="WAZA"/>

There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness [[Elsa the Lioness|Elsa]], who was raised by [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in [[Vienna]] by 1800 and England in 1825.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825<U+2013>1826 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=25 January 2011|year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |page=26 |chapter=July |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080624080642/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |archivedate= 24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |year=1997 |month=November |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding Of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424001716/http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archivedate=24 April 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2007}}</ref>

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cougar]]s. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh|Isaac Van Amburgh]] who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.<ref name = "baratay187"/> Van Amburgh performed before [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838 when he toured [[Great Britain]]. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.<ref name="baratay187">[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 187.</ref> The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903<U+2013>1965).<ref>{{Cite book| first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong but noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarchy|king]] of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name="Garai73">{{Cite book|last = Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn = 0-671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several [[Aesop's Fables|fables]] of the sixth century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] storyteller [[Aesop]].<ref>{{Cite book| author = Aesop | editor-last = Gibbs | editor-first = L |title= Fables |series=Oxford World's Classics |year=2002 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= 0-19-284050-9}}</ref>

Representations of lions date back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The Asiatic lion is a common motif in [[Chinese art]]. They were first used in art during the late [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (fifth or sixth century BC), and became much more popular during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC <U+2013> AD 220), when [[imperial guardian lions]] started to be placed in front of imperial palaces for protection. Because lions have never been native to China, early depictions were somewhat unrealistic; after the introduction of [[Buddhist art]] to China in the [[Tang Dynasty]] (after the sixth century AD), lions usually were depicted without wings, their bodies became thicker and shorter, and their manes became curly.<ref>{{Cite news | first = Li | last = Ling | month = May | year = 2002 | url= http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ccs/Newsletter/newsletter4/Lion/Lion.htm | contribution = The Two-Way Process in the Age of Globalization | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050406143133/http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ccs/Newsletter/newsletter4/Lion/Lion.htm | archivedate =2005-04-06 | others = Egan, Ronald transl. | newspaper = Ex/Change | type = newsletter | publisher = [[City University of Hong Kong]] | issue = 4 | accessdate = 26 September 2007 }}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> The [[lion dance]] is a form of traditional dance in [[Chinese culture]] in which performers mimic a lion's movements in a lion costume, often with musical accompaniment from cymbals, drums, and gongs.
