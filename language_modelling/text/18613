'''Patrick George Troughton''' ([[March 25]], [[1920]] <U+2013> [[March 28]], [[1987]]) was a versatile and prolific [[United Kingdom|British]] [[actor]] best known in his role as the [[Second Doctor|second]] incarnation of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in the long running [[United_Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction on television|sci-fi TV]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which he played from 1966 until 1969.

==Biography==
Troughton was born on 25 March 1920 in [[Mill Hill]], [[England]] and he attended public school in North London. He would later attend the Embassy School of Acting at Swiss Cottage, under [[Eileen Thorndike]]. After his time at the Embassy School of Acting, Troughton won a scholarship to the Leighton Rallius Studios at the John Drew Memorial Theatre on Long Island in [[New York]], [[USA]]. When the Second World War broke out, he returned to Britain on a Belgian ship. The ship hit a mine and sank off the coast of [[Great Britain]], but Troughton was fortunate enough to escape in a life boat. Troughton joined the Tonbridge Repertory Company in 1939 and later he joined the Royal Navy in 1940. He attained the rank of captaincy of a motor gunboat on duty in the North Sea.

After the war, Troughton  returned to the theatre in 1945. He worked with the Amersham Repertory Company, the Bristol Old Vic Company and the Pilgrim Players at the Mercury Theatre in [[Nottingham]]. He made his television debut in 1947. In 1948, Troughton made his cinema debut with small roles in [[Hamlet]] and the TCF production "Escape" (one of the stars of which was [[William Hartnell]]). However, television was his favorite medium. In 1953 he became the first actor to play the famous folk hero [[Robin Hood]] on television, starring in six half-hour episodes broadcast from [[March 17]] to [[April 21]] on the BBC, and titled simply ''Robin Hood'' (Vahimagi, 42). Troughton's other notable television roles included Sir Andrew Ffoulkes in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1954), Phineas in ''[[Jason & the Argonauts]]'' (1963), Quilp in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1962), "[[Paul of Tarsus]]" (BBC 1960), title role), ''Dr. Finlay's Casebook'' (BBC 1962, semiregular) He also guest starred in the British comedy television series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' in the episode "The Baddies", as well as in episodes of the British television series ''[[Survivors]]'', ''[[Minder (TV series)|Minder]]'', ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', and ''[[Inspector Morse]]''. 
 
===''Doctor Who''===
[[Image:Trougp08.jpg|180px|thumb|Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor]]
In 1966, ''Doctor Who'' producer [[Innes Lloyd]] decided to replace [[William Hartnell]] in the series' lead role. Lloyd later stated that Hartnell had approved of the choice, saying, "There's only one man in England who can take over, and that's Patrick Troughton" (Howe, Stammers and Walker, 68). Lloyd chose Troughton because of his extensive and versatile experience as a [[character actor]].  After he was cast, Troughton considered various ways to approach the role, to differentiate his portrayal from Hartnell's amiable-yet-tetchy patriarch.  Troughton's early thoughts about how he might play the Doctor included a "tough sea captain" and a piratical figure in [[blackface]] and a turban.  ''Doctor Who'' creator [[Sydney Newman]] suggested that the Doctor could be a "cosmic hobo" in the mold of [[Charlie Chaplin]], and this was the interpretation eventually chosen (Howe, Stammers and Walker, 68&ndash;69).

During his time on the series, Troughton tended to shun publicity.  He told one interviewer, "I think acting is magic.  If I tell you all about myself it will spoil it" (Howe, Stammers and Walker, 72).  Years later, he told another interviewer that his greatest concern was that too much publicity would limit his opportunities as a character actor after he left the role (KTEH interview).

Troughton was popular with both the production team and his co-stars.  Producer Lloyd credited Troughton with a "leading actor's temperament.  He was a father figure to the whole company and hence could embrace it and sweep it along with him."  Troughton also gained a reputation on set as a practical joker (Howe, Stammers and Walker, 68, 74).

Regrettably, many of the early episodes in which Troughton appeared were disposed of by the [[BBC]] (a full list of ''Doctor Who'' episodes missing in the [[BBC]] Archives is available [[list of incomplete Doctor Who serials|here]]).  Troughton found ''Doctor Who'''s schedule (at this time, 40 to 44 episodes per season) grueling, and decided to leave the series in 1969, after three years in the role.  This decision was also motivated in part by fear of [[typecasting]] (Howe, Stammers and Walker, 75; KTEH interview).

Troughton returned to ''Doctor Who'' three times after he originally left the programme. The first time was in ''[[The Three Doctors]]'', a 1973 serial celebrating the programme's 10th anniversary. Ten years later, Troughton overcame some reluctance to reprise his role and agreed to appear in the 20th anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' at the request of series producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. He also agreed to attend ''Doctor Who'' [[science fiction convention|conventions]] around the world with Nathan-Turner. Troughton enjoyed the return to the programme so much that he readily agreed to appear one more time as the Second Doctor with [[Colin Baker]]'s [[Sixth Doctor]] in ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' (1985).

=== After ''Doctor Who''===

After Troughton left Doctor Who in 1969, he appeared in a plethora of films and television roles such as the Duke of Norfolk in ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1969), Father Brennen in ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976), Melanthius in ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977), and Cole Hawlings in a [[BBC]] [[television]] dramatisation of the [[John Masefield]] children's book ''[[The Box of Delights]]'' (1984)

Two of Troughton's sons, [[David Troughton|David]] and [[Michael Troughton|Michael]], are both well-known actors on stage and screen. Three of his grandchildren are also making names for themselves. [[Jim Troughton]] plays professional [[cricket]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]]; [[Sam Troughton]] is an up-and-coming actor, who appeared in [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]] and the 2005 [[film|movie]] ''[[Spirit Trap]]'' with former ''Doctor Who'' star [[Billie Piper]]; [[Harry Melling (actor)|Harry Melling]] plays [[Dudley Dursley]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films.

Troughton's health was never entirely robust and later in his life he refused to accept his doctor's advice that he had developed a serious [[heart condition]] through overwork and [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. He suffered two major [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] in 1978 and 1984 which prevented him from working for several months. Following each of these attacks, his doctor's warnings were again ignored as Troughton committed himself to a heavy [[TV]] and [[film]] schedule. Troughton also continued to [[Tobacco smoking|smoke]] heavily and declined to commit himself to any significant physical exercise despite his worsening health and his early death being predicted as an inevitable consequence by his doctors.

He featured in the 1974 11-part radio adaptation of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Sword of Honour]]''. In 1986 he appeared in the ITV sitcom ''[[The Two of Us]]'', and his final [[television]] appearance was as a guest star on ''[[Supergran]]''.

==Death==
On [[March 27]], [[1987]], Troughton was a guest at the Magnum Opus Con II [[science fiction convention]] in [[Columbus, Georgia]]. Some attendees later said that Troughton looked clearly unwell at the time, although he appeared to be in good spirits throughout the day's panels and was looking forward to a belated birthday celebration which was planned for the coming Saturday evening as well as a screening of the ''Doctor Who'' story ''[[The Dominators]]'', which Troughton had requested personally, on the Saturday afternoon.

Troughton suffered a final, fatal, [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at 7:25 AM the next day ([[March 28]] [[1987]]) just after he had ordered his breakfast from the hotel staff. According to the paramedics who were called, Troughton had died before he had fallen back onto his bed. He was 67 years old.
