==Career==

===Western Province===

Barnes started his senior career with [[Cape Town]]-based {{Rut Western Province}} during the [[2006 Vodacom Cup]]. He made his debut against the {{Rut Mighty Elephants}} in [[Port Elizabeth]], coming on as a late substitute.<ref name="Match Breakdown: Mighty Elephants vs Vodacom Western Province">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=12720&category=&leagueid=411&homeid=5631&awayid=5632&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Mighty Elephants vs Vodacom Western Province | work=South African Rugby Union | date=10 February 2006 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He was promoted to the starting line-up for their next match against the {{Rut Golden Lions}} in Cape Town the following week<ref name="Match Breakdown: Vodacom Western Province vs Lions">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=12721&category=&leagueid=411&homeid=5632&awayid=5633&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Vodacom Western Province vs Lions | work=South African Rugby Union | date=18 February 2006 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> and eventually made a total of thirteen appearances for Western Province during the competition.

===Falcons===

In 2007, he moved north to [[East Rand]]-based side the {{Rut Falcons}}. He appeared in all six of the Falcons' matches in the [[2007 Vodacom Cup]] and scored his first senior try on his Falcons debut, a 17<U+2013>13 victory over the {{Rut Griffons}} in [[Welkom]] in the opening match of the season,<ref name="Match Breakdown: Griffons vs Valke">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=14206&category=&leagueid=586&homeid=6244&awayid=6245&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Griffons vs Valke | work=South African Rugby Union | date=23 February 2007 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> following this up with his second senior try a week later against {{Rut Griquas}} in [[Nigel, Gauteng|Nigel]].<ref name="Match Breakdown: Valke vs Wildeklawer Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=14213&category=&leagueid=586&homeid=6245&awayid=6246&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Valke vs Wildeklawer Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=3 March 2007 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>

He made his debut in the [[Currie Cup]] in 2007, coming on as a substitute in the Falcons' match against {{Rut Boland Cavaliers}} in [[Brakpan]].<ref name="Match Breakdown: Valke vs Boland Kavaliers">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=14306&category=&leagueid=588&homeid=6291&awayid=6295&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Valke vs Boland Kavaliers | work=South African Rugby Union | date=6 July 2007 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He played in ten of the Falcons matches during the [[2007 Currie Cup Premier Division]] <U+2013> scoring one try against the {{Rut Natal Sharks}}<ref name="Match Breakdown: The Sharks vs Valke">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=14352&category=&leagueid=588&homeid=6296&awayid=6291&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: The Sharks vs Valke | work=South African Rugby Union | date=6 October 2007 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> <U+2013> but couldn't prevent them finishing bottom of the log.

He established himself as the first choice hooker at the Falcons in 2008, starting all seven of their matches during the [[2008 Vodacom Cup]] and appearing in all fourteen of their matches during the [[2008 Currie Cup Premier Division]], where the Falcons once again finished bottom of the log, this time losing their Premier Division status in a two-legged play-off against the {{Rut Leopards}}.

===Griquas / Royal XV / Cheetahs===

Barnes, however, continued to play at Premier Division level as he made the move to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]-based side {{Rut Griquas}} for the 2009 season. After making eight starts during the [[2009 Vodacom Cup]] to help Griquas lift the trophy for the fourth time, he was also called up to a [[Highveld XV]] that played against the [[British and Irish Lions]] during their [[2009 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa|2009 tour to South Africa]]. Barnes scored a first-half try in his side's spirited 25<U+2013>37 loss to the touring side.<ref name="Royal XV 25-37 Lions">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/8073174.stm | title=Royal XV 25-37 Lions | publisher=BBC | date=30 May 2009 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="Match Breakdown: Royal XV vs British & Irish Lions">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=16146&category=&leagueid=644&homeid=7025&awayid=7033&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Royal XV vs British & Irish Lions | work=South African Rugby Union | date=30 May 2009 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>

He played in all fourteen of {{Rut Griquas}}' matches in the [[2009 Currie Cup Premier Division]], starting twelve of those and scoring two tries <U+2013> one in their match against the {{Rut Leopards}}<ref name="Match Breakdown: Platinum Leopards vs GWK Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=17450&category=&leagueid=733&homeid=7603&awayid=7605&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Platinum Leopards vs GWK Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=4 September 2009 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> and another against the {{Rut Blue Bulls}}.<ref name="Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs Vodacom Blue Bulls">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=17438&category=&leagueid=733&homeid=7605&awayid=7606&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs Vodacom Blue Bulls | work=South African Rugby Union | date=15 August 2009 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>

His performances for the Peacock Blues in also led to him being included in the {{Rut Cheetahs}} [[Super Rugby]] team for the [[2010 Super 14 season]]. After being an unused substitute the first three times he was named on the bench for the Cheetahs, he eventually came on just after the hour mark in their match against the {{Rut Hurricanes}} in [[Bloemfontein]].<ref name="Match Breakdown: Vodacom Cheetahs vs Hurricanes">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=18249&category=&leagueid=752&homeid=7842&awayid=7838&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Vodacom Cheetahs vs Hurricanes | work=South African Rugby Union | date=6 March 2010 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He started a Super Rugby match for the first time in April 2010 when he was included in the run-on side for their match against the {{Rut Chiefs}} in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]],<ref name="Match Breakdown: Chiefs vs Vodacom Cheetahs">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=18287&category=&leagueid=752&homeid=7835&awayid=7842&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Chiefs vs Vodacom Cheetahs | work=South African Rugby Union | date=23 April 2010 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> eventually making a total of eight appearances.

He played in all fourteen of {{Rut Griquas}}' matches during the [[2010 Currie Cup Premier Division]], scoring two tries to help them finish in sixth position in the competition.

2011 saw Barnes once again be a key player for the {{Rut Cheetahs}} during the [[2011 Super Rugby season]], making thirteen appearances including a spell during which he started eight consecutive matches for the side. His record during the [[2011 Currie Cup Premier Division]] was similar to that of 2010, with Barnes making fourteen appearances <U+2013> starting all of those <U+2013> and scoring two tries, against the {{Rut Natal Sharks}}<ref name="Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs The Sharks">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=20151&category=&leagueid=809&homeid=8538&awayid=8541&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs The Sharks | work=South African Rugby Union | date=5 August 2011 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> and {{Rut Golden Lions}}<ref name="Match Breakdown: MTN Golden Lions vs GWK Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=20169&category=&leagueid=809&homeid=8535&awayid=8538&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: MTN Golden Lions vs GWK Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=9 September 2011 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> respectively, as Griquas once again finished in sixth position.

During the [[2012 Super Rugby season]], Barnes' involvement was limited to just one substitute appearance in their match against the {{Rut Chiefs}} in Bloemfontein.<ref name="Match Breakdown: Toyota Cheetahs vs Chiefs">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=100541&category=&leagueid=1041&homeid=10291&awayid=10221&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Toyota Cheetahs vs Chiefs | work=South African Rugby Union | date=14 April 2012 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> [[Herc<U+00FA> Liebenberg]] was the preferred back-up choice to Cheetahs first-choice hooker [[Adriaan Strauss]], which led to Barnes being involved more in {{Rut Griquas}}' [[2012 Vodacom Cup]] campaign. He started in seven of their eight matches during the competition as they reached the final of the competition, where they lost 20<U+2013>18 to {{Rut Western Province}} on home soil. He made nine appearances for Griquas during the [[2012 Currie Cup Premier Division]] as they finished fifth in a now-reduced six-team league to avoid playing in a relegation play-off match.

The [[2013 Super Rugby season]] saw Barnes return to the Cheetahs squad as backup to Adriaan Strauss. He was named on the bench for all 17 of their matches (16 regular season matches, plus the Cheetahs' first ever [[2013 Super Rugby season#Finals|play-off]] appearance), but only played off the bench on eight occasions. He made nine starts for {{Rut Griquas}} during the [[2013 Currie Cup Premier Division]]; this time, the team failed to avoid finishing bottom of the log and they had to play in a two-legged relegation play-off against the {{Rut Pumas}}. Barnes started both the 21<U+2013>19 victory in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]<ref name="Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs Steval Pumas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=114924&category=&leagueid=1584&homeid=16304&awayid=16294&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: GWK Griquas vs Steval Pumas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=18 October 2013 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> and the 33<U+2013>15 defeat in [[Nelspruit]]<ref name="Match Breakdown: Steval Pumas vs GWK Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=114934&category=&leagueid=1584&homeid=16294&awayid=16304&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Steval Pumas vs GWK Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=25 October 2013 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> as Griquas lost their Premier Division status.

Once again used as the main understudy to Strauss during the [[2014 Super Rugby season]], Barnes made four appearances for the Cheetahs and scored one try in their match against the {{Rut Rebels}} in [[Melbourne]]<ref name="Match Breakdown: Rebels vs Toyota Cheetahs">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=113774&category=&leagueid=1574&homeid=16284&awayid=16144&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Rebels vs Toyota Cheetahs | work=South African Rugby Union | date=28 February 2014 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> <U+2013> Barnes' first try in [[Super Rugby]] in his 31st appearance for the side <U+2013> before being released to {{Rut Griquas}} to aid their attempt to return to the [[2014 Currie Cup Premier Division]] by virtue of winning the [[2014 Currie Cup qualification]] tournament. He played in all six matches in the tournament and scored his first ever two-try haul in their match against the {{Rut SWD Eagles}} in [[George, Western Cape|George]]<ref name="Match Breakdown: SWD Eagles vs GWK Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=119604&category=&leagueid=1774&homeid=18034&awayid=18064&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: SWD Eagles vs GWK Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=19 July 2014 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> to help his side top the log and return to the Premier Division. He played in all ten matches in the competition (although [[Martin Bezuidenhout]] was the regular starting hooker) as Griquas finished seventh in the competition.

Coincidentally, Barnes' final game for Griquas also turned out to be his 100th match for the side. He came on as a late substitute in the match against the {{Rut Blue Bulls}} in [[Pretoria]],<ref name="Match Breakdown: Vodacom Blue Bulls vs GWK Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=119974&category=&leagueid=1784&homeid=18094&awayid=18164&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Vodacom Blue Bulls vs GWK Griquas | work=South African Rugby Union | date=11 October 2014 | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> but marred the occasion as he was sent off just four minutes later for swearing at referee Pro Legoete, as Griquas crashed to a 46<U+2013>12 defeat.<ref name="Bulls rout hapless Griquas">{{cite web | url=http://www.rugby365.com/article/62596-bulls-rout-hapless-griquas | title=Bulls rout hapless Griquas | publisher=Rugby365 | date=11 October 2014 | accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref>

===Free State Cheetahs===

Barnes joined the {{Rut Free State Cheetahs}} for the 2015 season.<ref name="Ryno wil uit Adriaan se skaduwee beweeg by Cheetahs">{{cite web | url=http://www.netwerk24.com/sport/2014-09-16-boela-word-vrystater | title=Ryno wil uit Adriaan se skaduwee beweeg by Cheetahs | publisher=Netwerk24 | date=9 August 2014 | accessdate=14 October 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref>
