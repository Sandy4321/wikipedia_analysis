[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''David Evans''', [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (born '''Selwyn David Evans''' on 3&nbsp;June 1925) is a retired senior commander of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), and a writer and consultant on defence matters. He served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1982 until 1985. Since leaving the RAAF he has published two military treatises, ''A Fatal Rivalry: Australia's Defence at Risk'' and ''War: A Matter of Principles'', as well as an autobiography.

Enlisting in the Air Force in 1943, Evans graduated from flying school as a [[Sergeant Pilot|sergeant pilot]], and was converting to [[Bristol Beaufort|Beaufort]] bombers when World War&nbsp;II ended. He gained his commission as a [[pilot officer]] in 1947. From 1948 to 1949, he was a member of the Australian contingent operating [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]] transports in the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]]. He was a flying instructor in the early 1950s, before becoming a VIP captain with the [[Governor-General's Flight RAAF|Governor-General's Flight]] in 1954. His service in the flight earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in 1957. In the 1960s Evans was twice posted to [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;2 Squadron]], flying [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] jet bombers: first as a [[Flight (military unit)|flight commander]] when the unit was based in [[Malaysia]] from 1960 to 1962 and then as its commanding officer during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1967 to 1968. The Canberras achieved a high degree of accuracy on their bombing missions under his leadership, and he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] after completing his tour in Vietnam.

Evans held senior staff positions in the early 1970s, before serving as Officer Commanding [[RAAF Base Amberley]] from 1975 until 1977. Promoted to [[air vice marshal]], he then became Chief of Air Force Operations. In this role he worked to improve the RAAF's strategy for the defence of Australia, to fully exploit the "air-sea gap" on the northern approaches to the continent. Appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 1981, he was Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the [[Australian Defence Force]] before his promotion to [[air marshal]] and elevation to Chief of the Air Staff in April 1982. As head of the Air Force he focussed on morale, air power doctrine, and improving defensive capabilities in northern Australia. He was raised to [[Companion of the Order of Australia]] in 1984. Retiring from the RAAF in May 1985, Evans began to write and lecture on defence matters, and also stood for election in Federal politics. He was a board member and defence advisor to [[BAE Systems Australia|British Aerospace Australia]] (later BAE Systems Australia) from 1990 to 2009, and chairman of the [[National Capital Authority]] from 1997 until 2003. In 2001 he was awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] for his services to the ADF and the Canberra community.

His Air Force career should have finished then and there, as he was slated for [[Demobilization|demobilisation]] along with thousands of other wartime enlistees. Evans, however, was determined to remain and travelled to RAAF Headquarters in [[Melbourne]] to take his case to the officer responsible for discharges. He found a sympathetic ear and within days was transferred to [[No. 38 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;38 Squadron]], with which he flew [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Dakota]] transports on a regular courier service to Japan between October 1945 and May 1948.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref name="Going Solo">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 9</ref>

Retrieved on 6 July 2012.</ref> Airlift operations were considered particularly challenging, as aircraft were expected to fly on instruments their entire route, often in inclement weather, and keep just three minutes separation. On one occasion, Evans and his crew discovered that boxes of [[condom]]s were their main cargo. According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "as they took off into a bleak, snow-filled night they found themselves questioning the worth of the sortie, an attitude which doubtless was not shared by the eventual recipients".<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.199<U+2013>200</ref>  Evans' worst moment was when one of his engines failed just after take-off, with 23 passengers<U+2014>mostly children<U+2014>aboard, but he was able to land safely.<ref>Clark, ''Operation Pelican'', p. 53</ref>

Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans was posted to [[Central Flying School RAAF|Central Flying School]] (CFS) at [[RAAF Base East Sale]], Victoria, where he qualified as a flying instructor.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 65, 68, 70</ref> He served in this capacity for the next four years, including an exchange posting with the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] from May 1951 to July 1953.<ref name="AM"/><ref name="Post-War Years"/> As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the [[Korean War]] as a pilot with [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;77 Squadron]]; however the [[s:Korean Armistice Agreemen|armistice]] prevented this and he returned to No.&nbsp;38 Squadron as an instructor.<ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 79<U+2013>82</ref> In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the [[Governor-General's Flight RAAF|Governor-General's Flight]] (later [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;34 (Special Transport) Squadron]]} until 1956.<ref name="AM"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 426</ref> As well as Governor-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Sir William Slim]] and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 87, 93, 96</ref> Promoted to [[squadron leader]], Evans' service with the VIP flight earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] promulgated in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 13&nbsp;June 1957.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=41090|startpage=3410|supp=yes|date= 13 June 1957|accessdate=on 12 June 2011}}</ref> The same year, he attended [[Australian Defence College|RAAF Staff College]] at [[RAAF Williams|Point Cook]], Victoria.

Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection<U+2014>needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions<U+2014>that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat.<ref>Lax, ''From Controversy to Cutting Edge'', pp. 38<U+2013>40</ref> In January 1965, Evans was posted to [[Washington, DC]], as Assistant [[Attach<U+00E9>|Air Attach<U+00E9>]], having "had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements".<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', p. 136</ref>

==Vietnam War and senior command==

In April 1967, the Australian government committed No.&nbsp;2 Squadron and its Canberra bombers to action in the [[Vietnam War]]. Operating from [[Phan Rang Air Base]] outside [[Saigon]], under the direction of the US [[35th Fighter Wing|35th Tactical Fighter Wing]] (TFW), the Canberras were initially engaged in medium-altitude missions against [[Viet Cong]] forces, guided by Sky Spot ground radar, usually at night. Promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|wing commander]], Evans assumed control of the squadron in December 1967.<ref name="RAAF">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 271<U+2013>273</ref><ref name="RAAF in the War in Vietnam">Mordike, ''The RAAF in the War in Vietnam'', pp. 55<U+2013>58</ref> Having never heard a shot fired in anger in his 24 years of service, he was anxious for a combat assignment. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 had prevented him from seeing action in World War&nbsp;II, and the Korean War had ended just as he was on the verge of a posting for active duty with No.&nbsp;77 Squadron. "Vietnam", he reasoned, "would be my last chance".<ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 145<U+2013>146</ref> By the time he took command, the Canberras were flying a greater proportion of their missions at lower levels in daylight, using visual bomb-aiming methods honed during their earlier service in Malaysia; this gave the bombers an average [[circular error probability]] (CEP) of 50&nbsp;metres. Evans introduced intensive post-mission analysis to refine their technique, and permitted his pilots to bomb at the lowest level possible at which the bombsight would operate.<ref name="RAAF"/><ref name="RAAF in the War in Vietnam"/> The CEP was eventually reduced to 20&nbsp;metres, making the Canberras the most accurate bombing force in the region.<ref name="RAAF"/><ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 195<U+2013>196</ref> In January 1968, the unit participated in the air campaigns to defend [[Hu<U+1EBF>]] and [[Khe Sanh]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].<ref name="RAAF"/><ref name="RAAF in the War in Vietnam"/> Phan Rang itself was often subjected to harassing attacks and mortar fire from the Viet Cong, requiring Evans to undertake improvements to the airfield's ground defences.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', p. 231</ref> He completed his posting to Vietnam in November 1968 and was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his performance as commanding officer of No.&nbsp;2 Squadron.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>[http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/VeteranDetails.aspx?VeteranId=1283609 Evans, Selwyn David] at [http://www.vietnamroll.gov.au/home.aspx Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans].

He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] between January and August 1978.<ref name="AM"/><ref>Evans, ''Down to Earth'', pp. 203, 209, 214</ref> As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 [[Guam Doctrine]] that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of "forward defence" to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a "repulsion" concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the "repulsion" stance into what he termed an "anti-lodgement" strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the "air-sea gap" was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper ''The Defence of Australia 1987''.<ref name="RAAF pp.278-279">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 278<U+2013>279</ref> Evans was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] on [[Australia Day|26&nbsp;January 1981]] for his achievements as CAFOPS.<ref name="Post-War Years"/><ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=879867&search_type=quick&showInd=true Officer of the Order of Australia] at [http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/ It's an Honour].

In 1980, Evans was appointed Chief of Joint Operations and Plans for the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF).

Tindal was one of a series of forward air bases initiated by Air Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] when he was CAS in 1959, but a defence committee decision prior to Evans becoming CAS had determined to locate the RAAF's northernmost fighter squadron at Darwin. His chance remark in mid-1982 to the new Minister of Defence, [[Ian Sinclair]], regarding the suitability of Tindal over Darwin led to the former base being chosen as the home of [[No. 75 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;75 (Fighter) Squadron]].
