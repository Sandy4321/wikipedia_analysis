The '''District of Columbia Department of Transportation''' (or '''DDOT''') is an agency of the government of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] which manages and maintains publicly-owned transportation infrastructure in the District of Columbia. DDOT is the lead agency with authority over the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of [[street]]s, [[alley]]s, [[sidewalk]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[traffic signal]]s, and [[street light]]s in the District of Columbia.<ref name="About">[http://ddot.dc.gov/ddot/cwp/view,a,1251,q,559492,ddotNav,%7C32404%7C,.asp "About DDOT."

==History==
DDOT was originally known as the Division of Transportation, and was a subunit of the [[District of Columbia Department of Public Works]] (DPW).<ref name="Ungar">[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d01347r.pdf Ungar, Bernard L. ''Restructuring of the District of Columbia Department of Public Works' Division of Transportation.'' GAO-01-347R. Washington, D.C.: United States General Accounting Office, March 16, 2001.] Accessed 2010-01-08</ref><ref name="Goldstein">[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04644r.pdf Goldstein, Mark L. ''District of Columbia<U+2019>s Department of Transportation's Reorganization and Use of Federal-Aid Funding.'' GAO-04-644R. Washington, D.C.: United States General Accounting Office, May 14, 2004.] Accessed 2010-01-08</ref> The division began suffering from significant deficiencies in the 1990s, including an over-reliance on [[Outsourcing|outside contractors]], a lack of expertise with which to [[Principal-agent problem|oversee contractors]] and ensure performance and quality work, severe understaffing, and excessive lead times for the letting and implementing of design and construction contracts.<ref name="Ungar" /> These issues led to significant backlogs in maintenance and construction, and hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds were unexpended.<ref name="Ungar" />

In response to the impending management crisis in its transportation division, in May 2002 the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed the ''District Department of Transportation Establishment Act of 2002'' (D.C. Law 14-137), which separated the Division of Transportation from the Department of Public Works and created a stand-alone D.C. Department of Transportation.<ref name="Goldstein" /><ref>Kovaleski, Serge F. "Uneven Progress Marks Williams's Busy Term." ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]].'' September 1, 2002.</ref> A 2004 assessment indicated that the reorganization led to significant improvements in the District of Columbia's oversight of its transportation infrastructure.<ref name="Goldstein" />

==Operations==
DDOT is lead by a Director, assisted by a Chief of Staff, Deputy Director for Operations, and Deputy Director for Resource Allocation.<ref name="Chart">[http://ddot.dc.gov/ddot/cwp/view,a,1251,q,641189,ddotNav_GID,1609,ddotNav,%7C32404%7C,.asp "Organizational Chart."

No date.] Accessed 2010-01-08</ref> The current director is Gabe Klein, formerly an executive with [[Zipcar]] and a food supply company.<ref>[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/12/29/daily45.html O'Connell, Jonathan.

December 31, 2008.</ref> Five operational departments oversee DDOT's main functions: the Infrastructure Project Management Administration (IPMA), the Mass Transit Administration (MTA), the Transportation Policy & Planning Administration (TPPA), the Transportation Operations Administration (TOA), and the Urban Forestry Administration (UFA).<ref name="Chart" /> Four administrative offices (Communication, Information Technology, Contracting & Procurement, and Legal) provide managerial support.<ref name="Chart" />

DDOT coordinates a number of programs with other city and regional agencies.  DDOT shares street and sidewalk snow removal with the Department of Public Works, and coordinates a reduced-fare program for elementary and secondary school students with [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|MetroBus]] and [[Washington Metro|MetroRail]].<ref name="About" /> Because of the heavy regional integration of the District's transportation system with other local, county, state and federal governments, DDOT's Transportation Policy & Planning Administration coordinates policy with the [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] (WMATA) and the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]]' regional transportation planning and policy bodies.<ref name="Overview">[http://ddot.dc.gov/ddot/cwp/view,a,1251,q,559513,ddotNav,%7C32404%7C.asp "Transportation System Overview."

DDOT's headquarters is currently located at 2000 14th Street NW in Washington, D.C.  However, DDOT is scheduled to move to the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and Good Hope Road SE in the [[Anacostia, Washington, D.C.|Anacostia neighborhood]] when the second building in the Anacostia Gateway project is completed.<ref>[http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2007/10/22/story5.html Natarajan, Prabha.

Roads by Late Next Year." ''Washington Post.'' July 13, 2008.</ref>

==Funding and current projects==
As of 2004, all of the District's bridges and approximately 30 percent of its roads were eligible funding from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA).<ref name="Goldstein" /> The remaining roads are maintained solely with D.C. government funds.<ref name="Goldstein" />
