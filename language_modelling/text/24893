The '''A77 road''' is a major road in Scotland. It runs in a southwesternly direction from the city of [[Glasgow]], past the towns of [[Giffnock]], [[Newton Mearns]], [[Kilmarnock]], [[Prestwick]], [[Ayr]], [[Maybole]], [[Girvan]] and [[Stranraer]] to the town of [[Portpatrick]] on the [[Irish Sea]]. It passes through the [[council areas]] of Glasgow City, [[East Renfrewshire]], [[East Ayrshire]], [[South Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]].

It has full [[trunk road]] status from the terminus of the [[M77 motorway]] at [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] to the junction with the [[A75 road|A75]] in Stranraer.

The A77 is an important link from [[Glasgow]] to one of its two major airports, [[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport|Prestwick Airport]], and to the three main [[Transport_in_Scotland#Ferries|Northern Ireland ferry]] terminals at Stranraer, [[Cairnryan]], and [[Troon]]. As a result, the road is subject to a busy mixture of commuter, tourist and heavy goods vehicle traffic which has necessitated upgrades to many sections.

== History ==

[[Bypass (road)|Bypasses]] for Ayr and Kilmarnock were built in the 1970s, and the M77 motorway replaced the Glasgow to Newton Mearns section in two stages, in the mid-to-late 1990s, but [[M77_motorway#History|not without controversy]] as a section of the motorway was routed through [[Pollok Country Park]].

This still left the East Ayrshire stretch of the road which widely appeared in statistics as one of the most dangerous sections of road in Scotland.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The majority of this section was an unsegregated, 4-lane single carriageway between Kilmarnock and Newton Mearns and the lanes were narrow compared to the standard of other major roads. At several points, it was common for traffic waiting to turn right to queue in the fast lane. The speed limit of {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h}} was widely ignored. Finally, the road narrowed to only two lanes near Newton Mearns, causing long queues.
The combined result was a number of fatal crashes. The [[Scottish Executive]] took the decision to replace the entire section up to the Kilmarnock bypass with an extension of the M77 after pressure and campaigning from [[West Sound Radio]].

Construction of the motorway was faster than usual, given the eagerness to replace the A77 after another fatal crash in June 2002 resulted in the death of Hugh Davidson, then Chief Inspector of [[Strathclyde Police]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollofhonour.org/national_roll/2002/NPORH_2002.htm|title=Police Roll of Honour 2002| publisher=Roll of Honour Research | date=29 May 2012 | accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> and the motorway was opened in April 2005. This completed a continuous dual carriageway road from Glasgow to Ayr. 

In an effort to prevent a repeat of the fatalities on the southern section of the road, July 2005 saw the A77 become host to the largest automatic [[speed limit enforcement]] system in the whole of the UK. Based on the digital [[SPECS (speed camera)|SPECS]] system rather than the traditional fixed post [[GATSO]] film cameras, gantries with automatic numberplate recognition cameras are sited on the road at intervals of between 1 and {{convert|5|mi|km}} and measure the average speed of traffic. The enforced zone stretches from the Bogend Toll Junction ([[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Tarbolton]] junction) at the northern end on the dual carriageway section where the junctions are not [[grade separated]], down to just north of Lendalfoot; a distance of around {{convert|32|mi|km}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/projects/a77-symington-and-bogend-toll-project|title=A77 Symington and Bogend Toll Project <U+2013> Project Benefits| publisher=Transport Scotland | date=November 2010 | accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

From 10 March 2008 a long term temporary {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} limit to Dutch House Roundabout was introduced,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/31/newsitem/35/newscategory/0/|title=SPECS CONTINUES TO REDUCE A77 CASUALTIES| publisher=A77 Safety Group | date=30 October 2008 | accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> following the death in October 2006 of another police officer, Constable Kevin Lowe. Constable Lowe was on duty and en route at approximately {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} to a call at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/Lowe.html|title=DETERMINATION IN RESPECT OF THE DEATH OF POLICE CONSTABLE KEVIN LOWE| publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk | date=12 November 2007 | accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> This speed limit is to remain in force until new grade separated junctions are opened in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2012/04/12/transport-scotland-invites-bids-for-a75-and-a77/|title=Transport Scotland invites bids for A75 and A77| publisher=Construction Enquirer | date=12 April 2012 | accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

There have been continued efforts to improve the road in the south. One such project, the Turnberry Climbing Lane which opened in 2005, has enhanced guaranteed overtaking opportunities on the single carriageway section. Another improvement opened in Autumn 2006, the upgraded Whitletts roundabout<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/69 |title=IMPROVEMENTS AT WHITLETTS | publisher=A77 Safety Group | date=2006| accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> with [[traffic lights]] and spiral lanes. Climbing lanes were added at Haggstone and Drummuckloch and a {{convert|0.8|mi|km}} stretch was straightened north of nearby [[Glenapp Castle|Glenapp]] in autumn 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a77safetygroup.com/index.cfm/page/31/newsitem/36/newscategory/0/ |title=South west Scotland gets roads improvements Christmas present | publisher=A77 Safety Group | date=December 2008| accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> In 2011 a {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} stretch was widened from Park End to [[Bennane Head|Bennane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/news/A77-Parkend-Bennane-completion |title=Transport Minister views progress of A77 | publisher=Transport Scotland | date=13 July 2011| accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>

The A77 was formerly part of the [[Euroroute]] system, and comprised route E111.

==Proposed developments==

A [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] for [[Maybole]] is in planning stages but has not yet been funded (as at 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/news/A77-Parkend-Bennane-completion |title=Transport Minister views progress of A77 | publisher=Transport Scotland | date=13 July 2011| accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> <br>
Further minor improvements are planned with no dates published for:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/projects/trunk-road-projects |title=Trunk Road Projects | publisher=Transport Scotland | date=November 2010| accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> <br>
