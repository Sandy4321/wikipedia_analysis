The '''Saunders-Roe A.36 Lerwick''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[flying boat]] built by the [[Saunders-Roe|Saunders Roe Limited]] (Saro). It was intended to serve alongside the [[Short Sunderland]] in the [[Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force's]] [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]], but it was a flawed design and only a small number were built. They had a poor service record and a high accident rate - out of 21 aircraft, 10 were lost to accidents and one lost for unknown reasons.

==Design and development==
[[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Air Ministry Specification]] R.1/36 was issued in March 1936 to 
several companies that had experience in building flying boats. The specification was for a flying boat to replace the Royal Air Force's [[Saro London]], [[Supermarine Stranraer]] and [[Short Singapore]] biplane flying boats, for [[anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]], [[convoy|convoy escort]] and [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].

An order was placed for a prototype of [[Blackburn Aircraft|Blackburn's]] radical response to the specification - the [[Blackburn B-20]] - but this would only be delivered in 1940. Meanwhile, a contract was issued in June 1937 to buy 21 of Saunders-Roe's proposed aircraft - the S.36 Lerwick - even though this only existed on paper. The Lerwick was a compact twin-engined, high-winged [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction. It had a conventional flying boat hull with a planing bottom and two stabilising floats carried under the wings on long struts. It was powered by two [[Bristol Hercules]] [[Piston engine|engines]] and initially had twin fins and [[rudder]]s. For defense, the Lerwick was equipped with three powered [[Gun turret]]s. The nose turret had a [[Vickers K machine gun|Vickers K gun]]; the other two had [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] - two guns in the FN.8 turret in the dorsal position and four in the [[Nash & Thomson]] FN4.A turret at the tail.<ref>London 2003, p. 172.</ref> The offensive weapons - 2000&nbsp;lb (900&nbsp;kg) of bombs or depth charges - were carried in two streamlined nacelles behind the engines;<ref>London 2003, p. 173.</ref> a configuration shared by the [[Martin PBM Mariner]].

The first three aircraft were used as prototypes, with the first being launched on 31 October 1938 after numerous delays during design and construction. The Lerwick was immediately found to be unstable aerodynamically and on the water and not suited to "hands off" flying, a major problem in an aircraft designed for long-range patrols. Numerous adjustments, including the addition of a greatly enlarged single fin and increasing the [[angle of incidence|wing incidence]], failed to remedy its undesirable characteristics, which included a vicious [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and unsatisfactory rates of roll and [[Yaw angle|yaw]].<ref>Bowyer 1991, p. 149.</ref> In service, several aircraft would be lost because of wing floats breaking off, suggesting this was a structural weakness. Persistent problems with the aircraft's hydraulics would see the bomb doors sometimes dropping open during flight<ref name="London 2003, p. 185">London 2003, p. 185.</ref>

On one engine, the Lerwick could not maintain height, nor could it maintain a constant heading as the controls couldn't counter the torque of one engine on maximum power.<ref>London 2003, p.183.</ref> Thus, an engine failure would inevitably see the aircraft flying in slowly descending circles. On one occasion, the loss of an engine forced a Lerwick to make an emergency landing in the [[Caledonian Canal]]. The aircraft was then towed to [[Oban]] at the end of a string of coal barges.<ref>{{cite web

==Service==
In the summer of 1939, four Lerwicks were allocated to [[No. 240 Squadron RAF|240 Squadron]]. By October, the squadron had stopped flying them and reverted to its older and slower Saro London flying boats. The Lerwick programme was cancelled on the 24 October but restarted on 1 November. In December 1939, Air Vice-Marshal [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]] recommended the Lerwicks be scrapped and Saunders-Roe put to building Short Sunderlands but the production change would have taken months and with the start of [[World War II]], aircraft were urgently required.<ref>London 2003, p. 174.</ref>

[[Image:Saro Lerwick.png|thumb|right|250px|Lerwick in the markings of 209 squadron]]
Production continued and the type entered service with [[No. 209 Squadron RAF|209 Squadron]] based at [[Oban]] in 1940, replacing Short Singapores. The squadron soon began losing aircraft to accidents. During the service with 209 Squadron, all the Lerwicks were grounded twice for urgent safety modifications;<ref name="London 2003, p. 186"/> on only two occasions were U-boats ever attacked by a Lerwick and neither of the submarines was damaged.<ref name="London 2003, p. 186">London 2003, p. 186.</ref>

In April 1941, 209 Squadron began receiving [[PBY Catalina]]s. The last of a total of 21 Lerwicks was delivered in May but the type was withdrawn from front-line service in the same month.<ref name="London 2003, p. 186"/> Most of the remaining Lerwicks were transferred to  Number 4 (Coastal) [[Operational Conversion Unit|Operational Training Unit]] at [[Invergordon]]; three were sent to 240 Squadron for service trials at the highly-secret [[Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment]] at [[Helensburgh]]. 

In the Summer of 1942, the Lerwicks were briefly returned to service for the purpose of operational training with [[No. 422 Squadron RCAF|422 Squadron]] and [[No. 423 Squadron RCAF|423 Squadron]], Royal Canadian Air Force,<ref>{{cite web |last= |first=   |title=Saro Lerwick |url=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090328134427/http://www.rcaf.com/aircraft/patrol/lerwick/index.php? |work=RCAF.com |publisher= AEROWARE/RCAF.com |accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref> based at [[Loch Erne]]. By the end of 1942 the type had been declared obsolete; by early 1943 the survivors had been scrapped.
