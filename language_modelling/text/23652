'''Barrow-in-Furness''' ([[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]: Barragh-yn-Faiddis), often known simply as '''Barrow''', is an [[manufacturing|industrial town]] and [[seaport]] which forms about half the territory of the wider [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Borough of Barrow-in-Furness]] in the county of [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. It lies {{convert|100.2|mi|km|0}} northwest of [[Manchester]] and {{convert|54|mi|km|0}} south southwest from the [[county town]] of [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]]. The town is situated at the tip of the [[Furness|Furness peninsula]] bordered only by [[Morecambe Bay]] and the [[Irish Sea]]. Barrow is located just over {{convert|220|mi}} north-west of London and {{convert|60|mi}} south of the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Scottish border]].

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Barrow was a small fishing village before the arrival of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the mid-19th century. The building of the [[Furness Railway]] allowed iron ore to be transported to the area; the village's location made it ideal for smelting and then exporting steel. The natural harbour the booming town possessed allowed the locally produced steel to be put to another use: shipbuilding.<ref>[http://www.dockmuseum.org.uk/mission.htm Barrow Museum Mission Statement], The Dock Museum Website. URL accessed 11 December 2006.</ref> 

The shipyard became a significant producer of naval vessels and from the 1960s increasingly specialised in the construction of nuclear-powered submarines. The original iron- and steel- making enterprises closed down after [[World War II]], leaving boat building the area's main industry and employer. All of Britain's [[Vanguard class submarine]]s, which carry [[UK Trident program|Trident]] nuclear weapons, were manufactured at the facility. With the end of the [[Cold War]] and subsequent decrease in military spending the town suffered high unemployment, though the shipyard remains operational and the largest submarine production facility in the UK.<ref name="unemployment" /> 

==Toponymy==
The name was originally that of an island<U+2014>the name 'Barrai' can be traced back to 1190. This was later renamed 'Old Barrow', recorded as Oldebarrey in 1537, and Old Barrow Insula and Barrohead in 1577. The island was then joined to the mainland and the town took its name. The name itself seems to mean 'island with promontory', combining [[Brythonic languages|British]] ''barro-'' and [[Old Norse]] ''ey'', but it is more likely that Scandinavian settlers simply accepted ''barro-'' as a meaningless name, and so added an explanatory Old Norse second element.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mills|first= David|title= The Place Names of Lancashire|year= 1976|publisher= Batsford Books|location= London|isbn= 0 7134 3248 9}}</ref>

== History ==
In the [[Middle Ages]] the [[Furness|Furness peninsula]] was controlled by the Cistercian monks of the Abbey of St Mary of Furness, known as [[Furness Abbey]]. This was located in the 'Vale of Nightshade', now on the outskirts of the modern town.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=150#abbey | title=Local history and heritage | publisher=Barrow Borough Council | accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref> Originally founded for the [[Congregation of Savigny|Savigniac order]], it was built on the orders of [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]] in 1123. Soon after the abbey's foundation the monks discovered iron ore deposits, later to prove the basis for the Furness economy. These thin layers, close to the surface, were extracted through open cut workings,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cumbria-industries.org.uk/ironmining.htm | title=Iron Mining | publisher=Industries of Cumbria | accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> which were then smelted by the monks in small [[bloomery|bloomeries]] (early furnaces).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fellsanddales.org.uk/trails/mineral_wealth.php#mineral_wealth | title=Mineral Wealth | publisher=Cumbria Fells and Dales LEADER+ Programme | accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref> The proceeds from mining, along with agriculture and fisheries, meant that by the 15th century the abbey had become the second richest and most powerful [[Cistercian|Cistercian abbey]] in England, after [[Fountains Abbey]] in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web | author=English Heritage | title=Furness Abbey| publisher=English Heritage | url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConProperty.149 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}</ref>
However, Barrow itself was a hamlet in the parish of Dalton-in-Furness on the Furness peninsula reliant on the land and sea for survival. Small quantities of iron and ore were exported from jetties which were constructed into the channel separating the then-village and [[Walney Island]]. Amongst the oldest buildings in Barrow are several cottages and farm houses in [[Newbarns]] (now a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of the town) which date back to the early 1600s. Even as late as 1843 there were still only 32 dwellings including two pubs.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/pdf/summary%20of%20plan%20areas.pdf | title=Plan of Barrow 1843 | publisher=Barrow Borough Council | format=[[PDF]] | accessdate=2007-06-10 }}</ref> [[Image:FurnessAbbey.jpg|thumb|right|Furness Abbey]]

In 1839 [[Henry Schneider]] arrived as a young speculator and dealer in [[iron]], and he finally discovered large deposits of [[haematite]] in 1850. He and other investors founded the [[Furness Railway]], the first section of which opened in 1846 to transport the ore from the slate quarries at [[Kirkby-in-Furness]] and haematite mines at [[Lindal-in-Furness]] to a deep water harbour near [[Roa Island]].<ref name="railway">{{cite web | url =http://www.furnessrailwaytrust.org.uk/frco.htm | title = History of the Furness Railway Company | publisher = The Furness Railway Trust | accessdate = 2007-07-08}}</ref> The docks built between 1867 and 1881 in the more sheltered channel between the mainland and [[Barrow Island (England)|Barrow Island]] replaced the port at [[Roa Island]]. The increasing quantities of iron ore mined in Furness were then brought to Barrow to be transported by sea.

The investors in the burgeoning mining and railway industries decided greater profits could be made by smelting the iron ore into steel, and then exporting the finished product. Schneider and [[Sir James Ramsden|James Ramsden]], the railway's general manager, erected blast furnaces at Barrow that by 1876 formed the largest [[steelworks]] in the world at the time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/about_us/ironbridge_archaeology/projects/barrow/|title= Barrow|accessdate=2007-08-25 |publisher= [[Ironbridge Gorge]] Museum Trust}}</ref> Its success was a result of the availability of local iron ore, coal from the [[Cumberland]] mines and easy rail and sea transport. The Furness Railway, who counted local aristocrats [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|The Duke of Devonshire]] and the Duke of Buccleugh as investors, kick-started the Industrial Revolution on the peninsula. The railway brought mined ore to the town, where the steelworks produced large quantities of steel. It was used for shipbuilding or derived products such as rails were exported from the newly built docks.<ref name="railway"/> This caused Barrow's population, originally 700 in 1851, to reach 10,000 by 1864 and 47,000 by 1881, forty years after the railway was built.

The sheltered straight between Barrow and [[Walney Island]] was an ideal location for the shipyard. The first ship to be built was the ''Jane Roper'', launched in 1852; the first steamship, a 3,000-ton liner named ''Duke of Devonshire'', in 1873. Shipbuilding activity increased, and on 18 February 1871 the Barrow Shipbuilding Company was incorporated. Barrow's relative isolation from the United Kingdom's industrial heartlands meant the newly formed company included several capabilities that would usually be subcontracted to other establishments. In particular, a large engineering works was constructed including a foundry and pattern shop, a forge, and an engine shop. In addition, the shipyard had a joiners' shop, a boat-building shed and a sailmaking and rigging loft.<ref name="barrow-works">{{cite book | last = The Naval and Armaments Company Limited | title = The Works at Barrow-in-Furness of The Naval Construction and Armaments Company Limited - Historical and Descriptive | publisher = The Naval and Armaments Company Limited, partly reprinted from 'Engineering' magazine | year = 1896 | location = Barrow-in-Furness | page = 54 }}</ref> 

During these boom years, Ramsden proposed building a planned town to accommodate the large workforce which had arrived. There are few [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom|planned towns]] in the United Kingdom, and Barrow is one of the oldest. Its centre contains a grid of well-built terraced houses, with long tree-lined roads leading away from central squares. Ramsden later became the first [[mayor]] of Barrow,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=2490 |title= List of Mayors | publisher = Barrow Borough Council |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> which was given [[municipal borough]] status in 1867, and later [[county borough]] status in 1889.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dalton-in-furness.org.uk/dalton-online/history/modern-town/modern-town-localgov.html |title= History of Dalton-in-Furness |accessdate=2007-07-06 | work= Dalton Online|publisher= Dalton Community Association}}</ref> The imposing red sandstone Town Hall, designed by W.H. Lynn, was built in a [[neo-gothic]] style in 1887.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.barrowbc.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=150 | title = Local History and Heritage | publisher = Barrow Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}</ref> Prior to this, the borough council had met at the railway headquarters, the railway company's control of industry extended to the administration of the town itself.

The Barrow Shipbuilding Company was taken over by the [[Sheffield]] steel firm of [[Vickers]] in 1897, by which time the shipyard had surpassed the railway and steelworks as the largest employer and landowner in Barrow. The company constructed [[Vickerstown]], modelled on George Cadbury's [[Bournville]], on the adjacent [[Walney Island]] in the early twentieth century to house its employees.<ref>{{cite news | first=Frank | last=Partridge | coauthors= | title=The Compete Guide to: England's Islands | date=2006-03-16 | publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] | url =http://travel.independent.co.uk/uk/article351869.ece | work =[[The Independent]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | language = }}</ref> It also commissioned [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] to design [[Abbey House, Barrow-in-Furness|Abbey House]] as a guest house and residence for its managing director at the time, Commander Craven.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.rotary-ribi.org/clubs/committee.asp?ClubCtteeID=2939&ClubID=1734 |title=The Rotary Club of Furness |accessdate=2007-08-10 |publisher=The Rotary Club of Great Britain }}</ref>

By the 1890s the shipyard was heavily engaged in the construction of warships for the [[Royal Navy]] and also for export. The [[Royal Navy|Navy]]'s first submarine, ''[[Holland 1]]'', was built in 1901,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.submarineheritage.com/history.html | title=Submarine History of Barrow-in-Furness | publisher=Submarine Heritage Centre | accessdate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of [[airships]] ([[airship hangar]]) during the early 1900s.  [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/forgottenfutures/vickers/vickers.htm] Well-known ships built in Barrow include the [[Japanese battleship Mikasa|''Mikasa'']], Japanese flagship during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the liner [[SS Oriana (1959)|SS ''Oriana'']] and the aircraft carriers [[HMS Invincible (R05)|HMS ''Invincible'']] and [[HMAS Melbourne (R21)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']].

During [[World War II]] Barrow was a target for the German airforce, the [[Luftwaffe]], looking to disable the town's shipbuilding capabilities (see [[Barrow Blitz]]).<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bob1940/september2.html |title=The Battle of Britain - Diary - 2 September 1940 |accessdate=2007-08-05 |date=2005-02-16 |publisher=[[RAF]] }}</ref> The town suffered the most in a short period between April and May 1941. During the war, a local housewife, [[Nella Last]], was selected to write a diary of her everyday experiences on the home front for the [[Mass-Observation]] project. Her memoirs were later adapted for television as ''[[Housewife, 49]]'' starring [[Victoria Wood]]. The difficulty in targeting bombs meant that the shipyards and steelworks were often missed, at the expense of the residential areas. Ultimately, 83 people were killed and 11,000 houses in the area were left damaged. To escape the heaviest bombardments, many people in the central areas left the town to sleep in hedgerows with some being permanently evacuated. Barrow's industry continued to supply the war effort, with [[Winston Churchill]] visiting the town on one occasion to launch the aircraft carrier [[HMS Indomitable (R92)|HMS ''Indomitable'']].<ref name="dock">{{cite web |url= http://www.dockmuseum.org.uk/docs/Publication%20world%20war%20II-web.pdf|title= World War II|accessdate=2007-08-25|date=2005-02-16 |format= PDF|publisher= [[Dock Museum]]}}</ref>

The end of the war saw the beginning of a long decline of ore mining and steel-making as a result of overseas competition and dwindling resources. The Barrow ironworks closed in 1963,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nwda.co.uk/docs/Project_Corus_July05.doc|title= Project Corus (Workington) Steering Group Report|accessdate=2007-08-31 |date=  2005-06-01|format= [[DOC (computing)|DOC]]|publisher= Northwest Development Agency}}</ref> three years after the last Furness mine shut. The then small steelworks followed suit in 1983<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.banklands.com/Barrow%20Steel.htm | title=Barrow Steel | accessdate = 2007-07-21 }}</ref> leaving Barrow's shipyard as the town's principal industry. From the 1960s onwards it concentrated its efforts in [[submarine]] manufacture, and the UK's first [[nuclear-powered submarine]], [[HMS Dreadnought (S101)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] was constructed in 1960. [[HMS Resolution|HMS ''Resolution'']], the [[Swiftsure class submarine|''Swiftsure''-class]], [[Trafalgar class submarine|''Trafalgar''-class]] and [[Vanguard class submarine|''Vanguard''-class]] submarines all followed.

[[Image:Battleship Mikasa.jpg|thumb|right|Mikasa in Japan in 2005]]
The end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 marked a reduction in the demand for military ships and submarines, and the town entered a period of decline. The shipyard's dependency on military contracts at the expense of civilian and commercial engineering and shipbuilding meant it was particularly hard hit as government defence spending was reduced dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Maggie Mort |coauthors=Graham Spinardi |year=2004 |title=Defence and the decline of UK mechanical engineering - the case of Vickers at Barrow |journal=Business History |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>22 |url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/centres/css/library/mortspindardi_defenceandecline |accessdate= 2007-07-21 |doi=10.1080/00076790412331270099 |format={{Dead link|date=June 2008}} &ndash; <sup>[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3ADefence+and+the+decline+of+UK+mechanical+engineering+-+the+case+of+Vickers+at+Barrow&as_publication=Business+History&as_ylo=2004&as_yhi=2004&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup>}}</ref> As a result, the workforce shrank from 14,500 in 1990 to 5,800 in February 1995,<ref>{{Citation | publisher = [[Competition Commission]] | title = Views of main parties as part of report into British Aerospace PLC proposed merger with VSEL | date = 23 May 1995 | url = http://www.competition-commission.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/365c5.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> with overall unemployment in the town over that period rising from 4.6% to 10%.<ref name="unemployment">{{cite web |url= http://www.competition-commission.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/365a4.8.pdf|title= Appendix on unemployment as part of report into British Aerospace PLC proposed merger with VSEL|accessdate=2007-08-31 |date=  1995-05-23|format= PDF|publisher= [[Competition Commission]]}}</ref> The rejection by the [[VSEL]] management of detailed plans for Barrow's industrial renewal in the mid-to-late 1980s remains a point of contention.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mort|first= Maggie|title= Building the Trident Network|year= 2002|publisher= [[MIT Press]]|isbn= 0 262 13397 0}}</ref> This has led to renewed academic attention in recent years to the possibilities of converting military-industrial production in declining shipbuilding areas to those in the offshore renewable energy sector.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.basicint.org/nuclear/beyondtrident/oceans.pdf|title= Oceans of Work: Arms Conversion Revisited|accessdate=2007-08-25 |last= Schofield|first= Steven|year= 2007|month= January|format= PDF|publisher= [[British American Security Information Council]]}}</ref>

In August 2002 Barrow suffered the [[2002 Barrow-in-Furness Legionnaires' disease outbreak|UK's worst ever outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease]]. There were 172 people reported to have caught the disease, of which seven ultimately died. This made it the fourth worst outbreak in the world in terms of number of cases and sixth worst in terms of deaths (see [[Legionellosis#Outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease|list of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks]]). The source of the virus was later found to be from steam coming out of a badly maintained air conditioning unit. The system was located in the council-run arts centre Forum 28, with the vent emitting the disease over a busy alleyway in the town centre.<ref>{{cite news | title = Legionnaires' source officially traced | publisher = BBC News | date = 2002-08-20 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2205186.stm | accessdate=2003-07-21 }}</ref>

== Regeneration ==
[[Image:Sunset from West Shore, Walney.JPG|thumb|An autumn sunset on [[Walney|West Shore Beach]], [[Walney]]]]

===The waterfront===
Many areas of the town have seen regeneration in the [[1990s]] and on 28 September 2007 Barrow's <U+00A3>200 million Dockland regeneration project began. Due to be completed by 2020, the project includes a new 'Barrow Marina Village' which will incorporate a <U+00A3>8 million 400-berth [[marina]], 600 houses, restaurants, shops, hotels and a new state of the art bridge across Cavendish Dock.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} A large watersports centre is also being built, with the possibility of a [[cruise ship]] terminal, some cruise ships are already scheduled to dock in Barrow mainly for tourists to visit the Lake District despite there still being no official cruise ship terminal. The [[Tahitian Princess]] is visiting port in May 2009.<ref>[http://www.cruisecritic.co.uk/news/news.cfm?ID=3166 http://www.cruisecritic.co.uk/news/news.cfm?ID=3166]</ref>

===Shipyard===
The shipyard has been given planning permission to construct a new {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall assembly hall, dubbed 'Son of DDH' in a reference to the existing Devonshire Dock Hall shipbuilding facility. However, the building will not now be used for the construction of [[aircraft carrier]] sections as the carrier build will now take place in Glasgow. [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]], MP for Barrow, has, however, promised that all seven Astute Class submarines will be built at the shipyard.<ref>{{cite news | title=Council go-ahead for 'Son of DDH' | date= 2007-08-17 | publisher=[[North West Evening Mail]] | url =http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=531927 |accessdate = 2007-08-18}}</ref> Following a decline in employment levels at the shipyard over the last 20 years, BAE recently announced that the current workforce of 3,835 could soon grow to 5,000, although this is still only a third of the 14,000 employed in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news | title=BAE Work Force Stats| date= 2007-12-31 | publisher=[[North West Evening Mail]] | url =http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=547314 }}</ref>

===Bridges===
[[Image:Donghai Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Donghai Bridge]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]] has a similar structure to the proposed '''Morecambe Bay Bridge''']]

For many years there have been discussions whether or not to construct bridges across [[Morecambe Bay]] and the [[Duddon Estuary]], leading to the Build Duddon and Morecambe Bridges party contesting national elections in the borough of [[Barrow and Furness (UK Parliament constituency)|Barrow and Furness]], receiving 409 (1.1%) votes in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://politics.guardian.co.uk/person/0,,-10353,00.html|title= Timothy Bell|accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher= ''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref>

====Morecambe Bay bridge====
This project has recently received more coverage. Construction of the {{convert|12|mi|km|sing=on}} structure would create Europe's longest bridge and the [[List of bridges by length|7th longest in the world]]. Connecting [[Heysham]] in [[Lancashire]] to [[Rampside]], the bridge would also produce 200&nbsp;MW of renewable energy from a [[Tidal power#Tidal stream power|tidal stream system]], enough to power over 400,000 homes. The bridge would have a major economic impact on the area through increased employment and tourism, and would cut journeys to [[Manchester]] from Barrow from two hours down to under one, which would put Barrow within commuting range of a major city. The project's backer, Bridge Across the Bay Ltd., intends to seek planning permission in 2010. Subject to approval and the provision of finance, construction could begin around 2011, and the company estimates the bridge could be completed in 2015. [http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=509561&imageindex=0][http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/3723779.stm] The bridge is becoming ever more likely, as a second bridge to Walney Island from mainland Barrow is planned to relieve congestion, the [[Morecambe Bay]] bridge proposal is also being discussed by local councils[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=584104].

====Duddon Estuary bridge====
A smaller bridge crossing the Duddon Estuary linking [[Askam]] and [[Millom]], would definitely help improve transport links to the area.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} There has also been talk of building a road and rail tunnel under the Duddon instead of a bridge.[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=203923]

==Geography==
[[Image:Jubilee.JPG|thumb|right|[[Walney Bridge]] and [[Walney]] viewed from Barrow]]

Barrow-in-Furness is situated at the tip of the [[Furness]] [[peninsula]] on the north-western edge of [[Morecambe Bay]]. The town centre and major industrial areas sit on a fairly flat coastal shelf, with a gentle incline leading away from the coast. Ten miles (16&nbsp;km) to the north-east is the southern boundary of the English [[Lake District]].

=== Islands ===
{{Main|Islands of Furness}}
The town is sheltered from the Irish Sea by [[Walney Island]], a <span style="white-space:nowrap">14&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(22.5&nbsp;km)</span> long island connected to the mainland by the [[Bascule bridge|bascule]] type [[Walney Bridge|Jubilee bridge]]. About 13,000 live on the isle's various settlements, mostly in [[Vickerstown]], which was built to house workers in the rapidly expanding shipyard. Another significant island which lay in the Walney Channel was [[Barrow Island (England)|Barrow Island]], but following the filling of the channel to create land for the yard it is now directly connected to the town. Other islands which lie close to Barrow are [[Piel Island]], whose castle protected the harbour from marauding [[Scot]]s, [[Sheep Island (England)|Sheep Island]], [[Roa Island]] and [[Foulney Island]].

'''Population'''<br />
Barrow changed from a having a population in the low thousands in the early 1800s to a fully fledged town of 60,000 in less than twenty years. Since the start of the 20th century the population of the town has gradually diminished to just under 60,000. The [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Barrow council district]], which includes the surrounding area, has a population of 71,980 according to the most recent census, placing it 326th out of the 376 local authorities in England and Wales (however a population density of {{convert|900|PD/km2|abbr=on}} Barrow ranks 147th out of 376).<ref name="population"/> Barrow-in-Furness can be regarded as the largest town in Cumbria, Carlisle in the north of the county having city status. People from Barrow are known as ''Barrovians''.<ref>{{citation | first=Russell | last=Jenkins | coauthors= | title=Chocolate blog sends town into meltdown | date=2006-12-22 | publisher=[[News International]] | work =[[The Times]] | pages=15}}</ref>

'''Ethnicity'''

2008 estimates state 94.1[[%]] of Barrow's population as indigenous White British, and ethnic minority populations in Barrow stand at 5.9%, the breakdown of which is shown in the table below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276911&c=LA14+3LD&d=13&e=13&g=431977&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1198948694125&enc=1&dsFamilyId=1812|title= Resident Population Estimates by Ethnic Group|accessdate=2007-12-29 |work= Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher= National Statistics (statistics.gov.uk)}}</ref> The first people to settle in what is now Barrow were the [[Celts]] and [[Scandinavians]] followed by the [[Cornish people|Cornish]] although it wasn't until the late 19th century when mass immigration from [[Scotland]] and other parts of England meant the population skyrocketed to reach what it is today. The data below only restricts people to that one group (i.e. people of only partial Irish and Scottish descent, of which there are an extremely large number due to Barrow's proximity to the two countries are considered 'White British').

In the 2001 census 58,322 Barrovians stated themselves as being [[Christian]]. People stating no religion or chose not to state numbered 13,234 combined. The second largest religion in Barrow is [[Islam]] with a population of 182 Muslims. Other religious populations are as follows: 72 [[Buddhists]], (nearby [[Kadampa Buddhist Temple|Conishead Priory]], the first [[Kadampa]] Buddhist centre in the west, is home to around 100 Buddhists<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aboutulverston.co.uk/location/conisheadpriory.htm | title = Conishead Priory, Ulverston | accessdate=2007-07-21|publisher= AboutUlverston.co.uk}}</ref>) 46 [[Hindus]], 25 [[Jews]] and 96 with another religion.<ref name="population"/>

===Shipyard===
[[Image:BAE Systems from Walney.jpg|thumb|right|BAE Systems viewed from Walney Island]]
The [[BAE Systems Submarine Solutions]] shipyard at Barrow is one of the largest shipyards in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. It was expanded in 1986 by construction of a new covered assembly facility, the Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH), completed by [[Alfred McAlpine|Alfred McAlpine plc]], on land that was created by infilling part of the Devonshire Dock with 2.4 million tonnes of sand pumped from nearby Roosecote Sands.<ref>The Road to Success: Alfred McAlpine 1935 - 1985 page 174, Tony Gray, Rainbird Publishing, 1987</ref> DDH is the tallest building in Cumbria at 51&nbsp;m. With a length of 268 m (879 ft), width of 51 m (167 ft) and an area of {{convert|25000|m2|sqft|}} it is the largest shipbuilding construction complex of its kind in Europe.<ref>[http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2006/press_15052006.html BAE Systems Press Release]</ref> 

The DDH provides a controlled environment for ship and submarine assembly, and avoids the difficulties caused by building on the slope of traditional [[slipway]]s. Outside the hall, a 24,300 tonne capacity shiplift allows completed vessels to be lowered into the water independently of the tide. Vessels can also be lifted out of the water and transferred to the hall.<ref>{{cite paper | author = BAE Systems| title = Devonshire Dock Hall (DDH): One of the most advanced Shipbuilding Complexes in the World | url = http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/ss_asset/bae_subs_ddhdatasheet.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-06-03 }}</ref> The first use of the DDH was for construction of the [[Vanguard class submarine|''Vanguard''-class]] submarines, and later vessels of the [[Trafalgar class submarine|''Trafalgar''-class]] submarines were also built there. The shipyard is currently constructing the [[Astute class submarine|''Astute''-class submarines]] the first of which was launched on 8 June 2007.<ref name="Astute_launch">{{cite news | title = New UK nuclear submarine launched | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 8 June 2007 | url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6733777.stm | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}</ref> BAE is currently studying the design of a [[British replacement of the Trident system|new class]] of ballistic missile submarines.

BAE Systems has obtained planning permission from Barrow Borough Council for the new Central Assembly Shop dubbed 'Son of DDH' which will provide over 700 new jobs, initially in construction of a large section of the new [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier]]s. (hull lower block 3).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/EquipmentFactsheets/FactsheetTheRoyalNavysFutureAircraftCarriers.htm |title= FACTSHEET: The Royal Navy's Future Aircraft Carriers | accessdate=2007-09-23 |date= 2007-07-25|publisher= [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/viewarticle.aspx?id=531927|title= Go-Ahead for Son of DDH|accessdate=2007-08-15 |date= 2007-08-14|publisher= [[North West Evening Mail]]}}</ref> Despite the large fall in numbers employed by the shipyard, Barrow retains a high proportion of workers in the manufacturing industry. In September 2008, Barrow was named as the most [[working class]] location in the UK, based on a series of measures devised to judge the lifestyle of the people. Ironically in the 1870s Barrow had more aristocrats per head than anywhere else in the country.<ref>[http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/barrow/1.244620 http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/barrow/1.244620]</ref>

[[Image:HMSBulwarkL15.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Bulwark (L15)|HMS ''Bulwark'']] of the [[Albion class landing platform dock|''Albion''-class]] [[landing platform dock]]s.]]
The shipyard does not build submarines exclusively: it undertook fitting out and commissioning of helicopter carrier [[HMS Ocean (L12)|HMS ''Ocean'']] in the mid-1990s (although the ship was built by Kv<U+00E6>rner in [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]]), and construction of [[Wave Knight class tanker|Wave Class tanker]] [[RFA Wave Knight (A389)|''Wave Knight'']] and [[Albion class landing platform dock|Albion Class]] amphibious assault ships [[HMS Albion (L14)|HMS ''Albion'']] and [[HMS Bulwark (L15)|HMS ''Bulwark'']].[[Image:Astute2cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[HMS Astute (S119)|HMS Astute]] is the most recent vessel to be launched in Barrow]].

'''Motorcycle Racing'''

Barrow-in-Furness has staged speedway racing at three venues since the pioneer days in the late 1920s. The first track was at Holker Street.

===Dialect===
{{Unreferenced|date=June 2009}}
Barrow is unique within Cumbria and the local dialect tends to be more [[Lancashire]]-oriented. Like [[Liverpool]], this is due to the large numbers of settlers from various regions (including predominantly Scotland, elsewhere in England and [[Ireland]] amongst other locations). In general the ''Barrovian'' dialect tends to drop certain letters (including ''h'' and ''t''); for example holiday could be pronounced as '' 'oliday'', and with the drop of the ''h'' there is more emphasis on the letter ''o''.  This can also be seen with the word "hiya" which could be pronounced " 'iya" with a lot of emphasis on the letter ''i''. Another example is with the letter ''t'' where twenty is often pronounced "twen'y" (again an emphasis on the ''n'' could occur); see [[Cumbrian dialect]] as well as [[Lancashire dialect and accent|Lancashire dialect]] for more information.

===Nightlife===

There are countless [[pub]]s and [[working men's club]]s located across Barrow<U+2014>Barrow has fourteen of the latter, one of the highest number per capita of any British town.<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/10/06/barrow-in-furness-the-working-class-capital-of-britain-115875-20779478/</ref> There are also many [[bar (establishment)|bar]]s and [[club]]s found primarily in [[Barrow Town Centre]] on Duke Street and Cornwallis Street. Popular venues on Duke Street include the following bars: Chambers, The Lounge, Bar Cairo, [[Yates's]]. Cornwallis Street <U+2013> often dubbed the ''[[Gaza Strip]]'' by locals <U+2013> is currently undergoing a multi-million pound renovation with the former Martinis being the flagship renovation into Club M.

Les Muscutt, jazz banjo player and guitarist was born in Barrow in Furness in 1942. The family moved to East Ham in London where Les became a professional musician at age 15.

Shortly after the [[Second World War]] an Old Tyme Dancing trio was formed by Wyn Large ([[piano]]), Felix Lee ([[piano accordion]]) and Reg Powell ([[drums]]). This group entertained three or more times a week at several venues in the town and surrounding districts and was very popular with those locals who enjoyed keeping Old Tyme dancing alive. Wyn Large was succeeded by [[Billy]] Steele in the 1960s after which the group became known as the Felix Lee Trio until it disbanded in the 1970s due to its ageing members.

Education in the state sector is provided by the local education authority, [[Cumbria|Cumbria County Council]]. There are fifteen [[primary school]]s, five [[infant school]]s, five [[junior school]]s and many nurseries. Five [[secondary schools]] were created following the reorganisation of Barrow's selective tri-partite secondary education system in 1979: [[Parkview Community College of Technology|Parkview School]], [[St. Bernard's Catholic High School]], [[Walney School]], [[Thorncliffe School]] and [[Alfred Barrow School]]. Three schools - Parkview, Thorncliffe and Alfred Barrow are scheduled to close in August 2009 with a new Furness Academy due to take their place from the first of September 2009 on the Parkview and Thorncliffe sites - initially in the existing buildings there, which are planned to be replaced by state-of-the-art building on both sites within three years. In addition to publicly funded education, the town has one private school, [[Chetwynde School|Chetwynde]], which has fee-paying pupils from nursery to [[sixth form]] level.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chetwynde.co.uk/welcome.html|title= Welcome from the Head of School|accessdate=2007-08-18 |last= Nixon|first= Isobel|format= Flash|publisher= Chetwynde School}}</ref>
