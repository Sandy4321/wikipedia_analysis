==Etymology==
Aberdeen was named, in 1845, after the British [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]], [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen]]. It is famous to tourists for the [[boat people]] living in the harbour and the floating seafood restaurants such as the [[Jumbo Floating Restaurant]]. The [[Tanka (ethnic group)|boat people]] are generally associated with the fishing industry, and there are also several dozen expatriates living on boats in the harbour. 

Aberdeen is known indigenously as Heung Kong Tsai or Hong Kong Tsai (<U+9999><U+6E2F><U+4ED4>), which means Hong Kong Minor.  It is believed that Aberdeen is where the name of Hong Kong (more accurate transcription, Heung Kong) originates.  Heung Kong Tsuen (<U+9999><U+6E2F><U+6751>, Hong Kong village) on Ap Lei Chau was mentioned in [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] maps.  Another walled-village [[Heung Kong Wai]] in Wong Chuk Hang was also founded during [[Qianlong]] era of [[Qing]].  Heung Kong mean 'fragrant harbour', where incense trees ([[Aquilaria sinensis]]) from [[New Territories]] were transferred here to export to other cities in [[China]]. One alternative Chinese name was "Shek Pai Wan"<ref>[http://irc.aa.tufs.ac.jp/thomson/vol_1/mother/102.html Hong Kong] Illustrations of China and Its People, John Thomson 1837-1921, (London,1873-1874)</ref> (<U+77F3><U+6392><U+7063>).
