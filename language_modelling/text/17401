'''Sir Rowland Hill''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB,]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ([[December 3]], [[1795]] - [[August 27]], [[1879]]) was an [[English people|English]] [[teacher]], [[inventor]] and [[reform movement|social reformer]]. He campaigned for a comprehensive reform of the [[postal system]], based on the concept of [[Uniform Penny Post|penny postage]], and his solution of pre payment, and later served as a government postal official. He is usually credited with originating the basic concepts of the modern [[postal service]], including the invention of the [[postage stamp]].

==Earlier life==
Hill was born in Blackwell Street, [[Kidderminster]], [[Worcestershire]], [[England]].  Rowland's father, [[Thomas Wright Hill]], was an innovator in education and politics, including among his friends [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Tom Paine]] and [[Richard Price]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/default.asp?resource=4276 |title=Joseph Priestley and his Influence on Education in Birmingham |publisher=Revolutionary Players |date=2004-02-28 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  At the age of 11, Rowland became a student-teacher in his father's school.  He taught astronomy and earned extra money fixing scientific instruments. He also worked at the [[Birmingham Assay Office|Assay Office]] in Birmingham<ref>{{cite book |last=Seaborne |first=Malcolm |title=The English school: Its architecture and organization, 1370-1870 |publisher=Routledge and K.

===Educational reform===
In 1819, he moved his father's school ''Hill Top'' from central Birmingham, establishing the Hazelwood School at [[Edgbaston]], an affluent neighbourhood of [[Birmingham]], as an <U+201C>educational refraction of [[Joseph Priestly|Priestley's]] ideas<U+201D>.<ref>W. H. G. Armytage, <U+201C>The [[Lunar Society]] and its Contribution to Education<U+201D>, ''University of Birmingham Historical Journal,'' (1967-8)  V, 67.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bartrip |first=P.W.J. |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0007-1005%28198002%2928%3A1%3C46%3A%22TGSAE%3E2.0.CO%3B2-E&size=SMALL |title=A Thoroughly Good School": An Examination of the Hazelwood Experiment in Progressive Education |Journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |Vol=28, No. 1 (Feb., 1980) |pages=46-59 |publisher=British Journal of Educational Studies |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  Hazelwood was to provide a model for [[public education]] for the emerging [[middle classes]], aiming for useful, pupil-centred education which would give sufficient knowledge, skills and understanding to allow a student to continue self-education through a life <U+201C>most useful to society and most happy to himself<U+201D>.<ref>Elie Hal<U+00E9>vy, ''The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism.'' Faber (1972) pp.153-4, 249-478, 433, 491.
</ref>  The school, which Hill designed, included such marvels (for its time) as a science lab, a swimming pool, and forced air heating. In his ''Plans for the Government and Liberal Instruction of Boys in Large Numbers Drawn from Experience'' (1822, often cited as ''Public Education'') he argued that kindness, instead of caning, and moral influence, rather than fear, should be the predominant forces in school discipline.  Science was to be a compulsory subject, and students were to be self-governing.<ref name="tripod1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rowland-hill |title=Sir Rowland Hill |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  
Hazelwood gained international attention when French education leader and editor Marc Antoine Jullien, former secretary to [[Robespierre]], visited and wrote about the school in the June 1823 issue of his journal ''Revue''. Jullien even transferred his son there.  Hazelwood so impressed [[Jeremy Bentham]] that the school was moved to [[Bruce Castle]] in [[Tottenham]], London in 1827.

===Colonization of South Australia===
The colonization of [[South Australia]] was a project of [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]], who believed that many of the social problems in Britain were caused by overcrowding and overpopulation.  In 1832 Rowland Hill published a tract, entitled 	
''Home colonies : sketch of a plan for the gradual extinction of pauperism, and for the diminution of crime'', based on a Dutch  model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/rowland-hill/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Rowland Hill |publisher=Bookrags.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  Hill then served from 1833 until 1839 as secretary of the South Australian Colonization Commission, which worked successfully to establish a settlement without convicts at what is today [[Adelaide]].  The political economist, [[Robert Torrens (economist)|Robert Torrens]] was chairman of the Commission.<ref name="PUP">{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Denis P. |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |title=The Classical Economists Revisited'&#39; |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  Under the [[South Australia Act 1834]], the colony was to embody the ideals and best qualities of British society, shaped by [[religious freedom]] and a commitment to [[social progress]] and [[civil liberties]].

==Postal reform==
Hill interested himself in a reform of the postal system, as well.<ref>[http://www.newstodaynet.com/2005sud/05dec/ss13.htm V. Sundaram, "The Founding Father of Postal Reform," ''News Today,'' Chennai, India  (December 28, 2005)]{{dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref> In the 1830's at least 12<U+00BD>% of all British mail was conveyed under the personal frank of Peers, dignitaries and Members of Parliament, while censorship and political espionage were conducted by postal officials.  Fundamentally, the postal system was mismanaged, wasteful, expensive and slow.  It had become inadequate for the needs of an expanding commercial and industrial nation.<ref>David Allam, "The Social and Economic Importance of Postal Reform in 1840," ''Harry Hays Philatelic Pamphlets'' No. 4. (1976)  ISBN O 905222 17 2</ref> There is a well-known story, probably apocryphal, about how Hill gained an interest in reforming the postal system -- that he noticed a young woman too poor to redeem a letter sent to her by her fianc<U+00E9>.  At that time, letters were normally paid for by the recipient, not the sender.  The recipient could simply refuse delivery.  Frauds were commonplace; for example, coded information could appear on the cover of the letter; the recipient would examine the cover to gain the information, and then refuse delivery to avoid payment.  Each individual letter had to be logged.  In addition, postal rates were complex, depending on the distance and the number of sheets in the letter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Bastiat/basSoph7.html |title=Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Bastiat: Economic Sophisms: Series 2, Chapter 12. See II.12.25 |publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> 
  
[[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Ramsey McCulloch]], both advocates of free trade, attacked the policies of privilege and protection of the Tory government.  McCulloch, in 1833, advanced the view that "nothing contributes more to facilitate commerce than the safe, speedy and cheap conveyance of letters."<ref>Howard Robinson, ''The British Post Office; a History.'' Princeton, Princeton Univ. Press. (1948)</ref>	
 
Hill's famous pamphlet, ''Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability,'' was privately circulated in 1837.  The report called for "low and uniform rates" according to weight, rather than distance.  Hill's study showed that most of the costs in the postal system were not for transport, but rather for laborious handling procedures at the origins and the destinations.  Costs could be reduced dramatically if postage were prepaid by the sender, the prepayment to be proven by the use of prepaid letter sheets or adhesive stamps (adhesive stamps had long been used to show payment of taxes, on documents for example).  Letter sheets were to be used because envelopes were not yet common; they were not yet mass-produced, and in an era when postage was calculated partly on the basis of the number of sheets of paper used, the same sheet of paper would be folded and serve for both the message and the address.  In addition, Hill  proposed to lower the postage rate to a penny per half ounce, without regard to distance.<ref>http://imagesoftheworld.org/stamps/rowlandhill.htm  Rowland Hill (1795-1879):
''Post Office Reform, its Importance and Practicability''</ref> He presented his proposal to the Government in 1838.

[[Image:Penny black.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The [[Penny Black]], the first postage stamp]]
In the House of Lords the Postmaster, [[Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield|Lord Lichfield]], thundered about Hill's "wild and visionary schemes."  [[William Leader Maberly]], Secretary to the Post Office, denounced Hill's study:  "This plan appears to be a preposterous one, utterly unsupported by facts and resting entirely on assumption".  But merchants, traders and bankers viewed the existing system as corrupt and a restraint of trade.  They formed a "Mercantile Committee" to advocate for Hill's plan and pushed for its adoption.  In 1839, Hill was given a two-year contract to run the new system.

Postal service rates were lowered almost immediately, to fourpence from the [[5 December]] [[1839]], then to the penny rate on the [[10 January]] [[1840]], even before stamps or letter sheets could be printed.  The volume of paid internal correspondence increased dramatically, by 120%, between November 1839 and February 1840. This initial increase resulted from the elimination of "free franking" privileges and smuggling.  

Prepaid letter sheets, with a design by [[William Mulready]], were distributed in early 1840.  These [[Mulready stationery|Mulready envelopes]] were not popular and were widely satirized.  According to a brochure distributed by the National Postal Museum (now the [[British Postal Museum & Archive]]), the Mulready envelopes threatened the livelihoods of stationery manufacturers, who encouraged the satires.  They became so unpopular that the government used them on official mail and destroyed many others. 

However, as a niche commercial publishing industry for machine-printed illustrated envelopes subsequently developed in Britain and elsewhere it is likely that it was the sentiment of the illustration that provoked the ridicule and led to their withdrawal. Indeed in the absence of examples of machine-printed illustrated envelopes prior to this it may be appropriate to recognize the Mulready envelope as a significant innovation in its own right. Machine-printed illustrated envelopes are a mainstay of the [[direct mail]] industry.

In May 1840, the world's first adhesive postage stamps were distributed.  With an elegant engraving of the young Queen Victoria, the [[Penny Black]] was an immediate success.  Refinements, such as perforations to ease the separating of the stamps, would be instituted with later issues.

==Later life==
Rowland Hill continued at the Post Office until the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won re-election. Sir [[Robert Peel]] returned to office between [[30 August]] [[1841]] and [[29 June]] [[1846]]. Amid rancorous controversy, Hill was dismissed in July 1842. However, the [[London and Brighton Railway]] named him a director and later chairman of the board, from 1843 to 1846. He lowered the fares from London to Brighton, expanded the routes, offered special excursion trains, and made the commute comfortable for passengers.  In 1844 [[Edwin Chadwick]], Rowland Hill, [[John Stuart Mill]], Lyon Playfair, Dr. Neill Arnott, and other friends formed a society called "Friends in Council," which met at each other's houses to discuss questions of political economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chadwick_edwinbio_a4.html |title=Biography of Edwin Chadwick |publisher=DNB |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>  Hill also became a member of the influential [[Political Economy Club]], founded by [[David Ricardo]] and other classical economists, but now including many powerful businessmen and political figures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7829.html |title=D. P. O'Brien, The Classical Economists Revisited |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref>

In 1846, when the Conservatives left office, Hill became Secretary to the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]], and then Secretary to the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|Post Office]] from 1854 until 1864.  For his services Hill was knighted as a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1860.  He became a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] and was given an honorary degree from [[Oxford University|Oxford]].

He died in [[Hampstead]], London in 1879. Sir Rowland Hill is buried in [[Westminster Abbey]]; there is a memorial to him on his family grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]]. There are streets named after him in Hampstead (running off Haverstock Hill, down the side of The [[Royal Free Hospital]]), and Tottenham (off [[White Hart Lane]]).

==Legacy==
Hill's legacies are two-fold:  the first was his model for education of the emerging middle classes.  The second was his model for an efficient [[postal system]] to serve business and the public, including the [[postage stamp]] and the system of low and uniform postal rates, which is often take for granted in the modern world.  In this, he not only changed the [[postal services]] around the world, but also made commerce more efficient and profitable, notwithstanding the fact that it took 30 years before the British Post Office's revenue recovered to the level it had been at in 1839. In fact the [[Uniform Penny Post]] continued in the United Kingdom into the 20th century, and at one point, one penny paid for up to four ounces.

There are three public statues of him. The first, sculpted by [[Thomas Brock|Sir Thomas Brock]] and unveiled in 1881, stands in the town of his birthplace, Kidderminster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BM/WOwfKIxx002.htm |title=Sir Rowland Hill (1795-1879) |publisher=Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project |date=1990-05-01 |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> The second, by [[Edward Onslow Ford]] stands at King Edward Street, London<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/CL/CLCOL211.htm |title=Rowland Hill, Statue, King Edward St. |publisher=Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> The third, less known, by [[Peter Hollins]], used to stand in [[Hurst Street]], [[Birmingham]] but it is currently in the [[Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery]] store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/BM/WMbiBIxx138.htm |title=Sir Rowland Hill (1795-1879) |publisher=Rowland Hill, Statue, King Edward St. |date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> A life size white marble bust by W.

At [[Tottenham]] there is {{As of|2004|alt=now}} a local History Museum at [[Bruce Castle]] (where Hill lived during the 1840s) including some relevant exhibits.
