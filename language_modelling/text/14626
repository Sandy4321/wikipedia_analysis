The population was 10,352 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. According to local legend, the town was named for the English poet [[John Milton]], but the name most likely originated from [[William FitzWilliam, 4th Earl FitzWilliam]], who held the title Viscount Milton.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC ''The Vermont Encyclopedia'', page 206.]</ref>

==History==
Milton was chartered by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] of New Hampshire on June 8, 1763. In February 1782, the town was first settled by William Irish, Leonard Owen, Amos Mansfield, Absalom Taylor, and Thomas Dewey. There were approximately 300 settlers living in Milton by 1795. It was necessary to build a new meeting place, as meeting in private homes would no longer suffice. The Town House was built in 1849. In 1878 it was destroyed by a fire.
Early settlers in Milton made most of their income from lumber and potash until 1840 when dairy became popular and butter and cheese were sold. Eventually milk was also shipped to Boston and New York.<ref>[http://www.milton.govoffice2.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={337BC1DF-ADD9-4AD2-8D26-47EFC493BF71}]</ref>
