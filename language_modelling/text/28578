'''Algiers''' {{IPA-en|<U+00E6>l<U+02C8>d<U+0292><U+026A><U+0259>rz|}} ({{lang-ar|<big><U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0632><U+0627><U+0626><U+0631></big>}}, ''al-Djaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir''), is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest city of [[Algeria]] and the second largest of the [[Maghreb]] after [[Casablanca]]. According to the 1998 census, the population of the city proper was 1,519,570 and that of the urban agglomeration was 2,135,630.<ref name=citypop/> A recent UN estimate of the urban agglomeration (metropolitan area) puts the population at 3,354,000 as of 2007.<ref name=wup/>

Called ''El-Bahdja'' (<U+0627><U+0644><U+0628><U+0647><U+062C><U+0629>) or alternatively ''Alger la Blanche'' ("Algiers the White") for the glistening white of its buildings as seen rising up from the sea, Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The city name is derived (via [[French language|French]] ''Alger'' and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Algu<U+00E8>re''<ref name=leschi>''Origins of Algiers'' by Louis Leschi, speech delivered June 16, 1941 published in ''El Djezair Sheets'', July 1941 [http://alger-roi.fr/Alger/alger_son_histoire/textes/3_origines_alger_1941_feuillets.htm History of Algeria] {{fr icon}}.</ref>) from the Arabic word <U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0632><U+0627><U+0626><U+0631> ''al-jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir'', which translates as ''the islands'', referring to the four islands which lay off the city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525. ''Al-jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir'' is itself a truncated form of the city's older name <U+062C><U+0632><U+0627><U+0626><U+0631> <U+0628><U+0646><U+064A> <U+0645><U+0627><U+0632><U+063A><U+0627><U+0646> ''jaz<U+0101><U+2019>ir ban<U+012B> mazghann<U+0101>'', "the islands of (the tribe) Bani Mazghanna", used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]] and [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]].

The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the [[dey]]s, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the [[casbah]] or citadel, {{convert|400|ft|0}} above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.

==History==
A [[Phoenicia]]n commercial outpost called ''Ikosim'' which later developed into a small [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town called ''[[Icosium]]'' existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The ''rue de la Marine'' follows the lines of what used to be a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near ''[[Bab-el-Oued]]'' and ''[[Bab Azoun]]''. The city was given [[Latin]] rights by [[Vespasian]]. The [[bishop]]s of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century.
[[File:Algiers CNE-v1-p58-J.jpg|thumb|City and harbour of Algiers, circa 1921]]

The present-day city was founded in 944 by [[Buluggin ibn Ziri]], the founder of the [[Berber people|Berber]] [[Zirid]]<U+2013>[[Sanhaja]] dynasty, which was overthrown by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1148, although the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers before the final fall of the dynasty. The city was occupied by the [[Almohades]] in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the Abd-el-Wadid sultans of [[Tlemcen]]. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under [[amir]]s of its own due to [[Oran]] being the chief seaport and center of power of the Abd-el-Wahid.

[[File:Old algiers 16th century.jpg|thumb|left|Old Algiers in the 16th century, with the Spanish-built Pe<U+00F1><U+00F3>n of Algiers in the forefront.]]
As early as 1302 the islet of Pe<U+00F1><U+00F3>n in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and [[Spain]]. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the expulsion of the [[Moors]] from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Penon and imposed a levy intended to suppress [[corsair]] activity.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 13.</ref> In 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers [[Oruc]] and [[Barbarossa (Ottoman admiral)|Hayreddin]] Barbarossa to expel the Spaniards. Oruc came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town. Hayreddin, succeeding Oruc after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards at Tlemcen, was the founder of the ''[[pashaluk]]'', which subsequently became the ''[[beylik]]'', of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with [[Capture of Algiers (1529)]], and then formally invited the Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the [[Barbary pirates]]. In October 1541 in the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]], the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their [[Pasha]], Hassan.

Formally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 17th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heimaslod.is/index.php/Tyrkjar%C3%A1ni%C3%B0 |title=Tyrkjar<U+00E1>ni<U+00F0> - Heimasl<U+00F3><U+00F0> |language={{is icon}} |publisher=Heimaslod.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> The [[United States]] fought two wars (the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]]s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.

[[File:Algiers and Bejaia by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Historic map of Algiers by [[Piri Reis]]]]
The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Jew]]ish, [[Moors|Moorish]] and [[Kabyle]] communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, pp. 13-14.</ref>

In 1817, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under [[Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth|Lord Exmouth]] (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), assisted by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.

The history of Algiers from 1815 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of [[Algeria]] and its relationship to [[France]]. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul<U+2014>whom the [[dey]] had hit with a [[fly-whisk]] when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian Jewish merchants<U+2014>a French army under [[Louis-Auguste-Victor, Count de Ghaisnes de Bourmont|General de Bourmont]] attacked the city in the [[invasion of Algiers in 1830|1830 invasion of Algiers]]. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became a French colony.

During the 1930s, the architect [[Le Corbusier]] drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as "nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which "the 'civilised' live like rats in holes" whereas "the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being".<ref>Celik, Zeynep, ''Urban Forms and Colonial Confrontations: Algiers Under French Rule'', University of California Press, 1997, p. 5.</ref> However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French colonial administration.

During [[World War II]], Algiers was the last city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during [[Operation Torch]].

In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which up to 1.5 million Algerians died at the hands of the [[French Army]] and the Algerian [[Front de Lib<U+00E9>ration Nationale]], Algeria finally gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire European or ''[[pied-noir]]'' population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about 3 million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population<U+2014>and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding [[Metidja]] plain.

Algiers was the host city for both the 1978 and 2007 [[All-Africa Games]]. The city was also designated the [[Arab Capital of Culture]] for 2007.

===War of Algeria===
[[File:Algiers Coat of Arms.svg|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of French Algiers]]
Algiers also played a decisive part in the [[Algerian War of Independence|War of Algeria]] (1954<U+2013>1962), particularly during the Battle of Algiers when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of then French Minister of Justice [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]] (who authorized any means "to eliminate the insurrectionists"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between Algerian forces who, on the one hand, resorted to attacking the French colonists, and the French Army who, on the other, carried out a bloody repression including the quasi-systematic use of torture on protesters of the colonial order. Two such victims were the nationalist leader, [[Larbi Ben M'Hidi]], and a young professor of mathematics, [[Maurice Audin]], both of whom have since been honored by the municipality with principal arteries of the city named after them. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in France, as well as the return of General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] to power.

===Independence===
Algeria achieved independence on July 5, 1962. Run by the military that had liberated it, Algiers became a member of [[Non-Aligned Movement]] during the [[Cold War]]. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single party system and the creation of a ''real'' [[democracy]] baptized the <U+201C>Spring of Algiers<U+201D>. The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the reign of the single party and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.

===Crisis of the 1990s===
The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1992. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the of turn events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army cancelled the election process, setting off a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]] between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.

===Algiers in the 21st century===
Recently Algiers has sought to once again become an important African and Mediterranean capital, envisioning having a comparable level of infrastructure development to what it had in 1962 relative to other countries. [[File:P4160143.JPG|thumb|Sight of Algiers from Notre Dame d'Afrique]]
Algiers is opening itself up to the world by hosting a variety of international conferences and events. This new openness has attracted the investment of a number of multinational companies in recent years, such as: Carrefour, Yves Rocher, and even Quick. However, many large infrastructure projects are struggling to be completed: the Algiers subway, the tramway, urban renewal projects, the creation of new urban centers on the periphery.
[[File:Babezzouar.jpg|thumb|Towers in Algiers]]
The current infrastructure has not been able to keep up with Algiers' rapid growth.

Algiers is currently ranked lowest out of 132 capitals in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life survey. The survey takes into consideration 40 different criteria divided into five categories: stability, health services, culture and environment, education, and the availability of basic services. Algiers was ranked lower than such cities as Tripoli (Libya), Abidjan (C<U+00F4>te-d'Ivoire), and even Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. In 2005 the same survey ranked Algiers 125th out of 129 cities.

====Bombings====
2007 brought mixed results for Algiers. The city was named the capital of "Arab culture", and a double bombing attack occurred on April 11 with one bomb targeting the government building housing the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior; and another bomb targeting the police station in Bab-Ezzouar. An organization calling itself the Maghreb branch of Al-Qaida took responsibility for the attacks.

On December 11, 2007, two car [[11 December 2007 Algiers bombings|bombs exploded in the city of Algiers]]. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll is at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Les autorit<U+00E9>s accusent al-Qa<U+00EF>da|publisher=RFI|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/096/article_60149.asp|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Toll in Algiers bombings rises to 31|agency=Associated Press|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071212/ap_on_re_af/algeria_explosion|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> As of now, it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Al Qaeda blamed for Algeria bombs|publisher=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/12/11/algeria.blast/index.html|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

==Districts of Algiers==
[[File:NOTRE DAME D'AFRIQUE.ALGER.jpg|thumb|[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]]]]

* The ''' [[Casbah]] ''' (of '' Al Qasbah '', <U+201C>the Citadel<U+201D>), Ier District of Algiers: called '' Al-Djaza<U+00EF>r Al Mahroussa '' (<U+201C>Well Kept Algiers<U+201D>), it is founded on the ruins of old Icosium. It is a small city which, built on a hill, goes down towards the sea, divided in two: the High city and the Low city. One finds there masonries and mosques of the 17th century; Ketchaoua mosque (built in 1794 by the Dey Baba Hassan) flanked by two minarets, mosque el Djedid (built in 1660, at the time of Turkish regency) with its large finished ovoid cupola points some and its four coupolettes, mosque El K<U+00E9>bir (oldest of the mosques, it was built by [[almoravides|almoravide]] [[Youssef Ibn Tachfin]] and rebuilt later in 1794), mosque Ali Betchnin (Ra<U+00EF>s, 1623), Dar Aziza, palate of J<U+00E9>nina. In the Kasbah, there are also labyrinths of lanes and houses that are very picturesque; and if one gets lost there, it is enough to go down again towards the sea to reposition oneself.

* ''' [[Bab El Oued]] ''': popular district which extends from the Casbah beyond "the gate of the river". It is the district more '' chouchout<U+00E9> '' and more liked of all the districts of the capital. Famous for its place <U+201C>the three clocks<U+201D> and for its <U+201C>market Triplet<U+201D>, it is also a district of workshops and manufactures.
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Alger.jpg|thumb|left|Bab El Wadi]] -->
* ''' Edge of sea ''': from 1840, the architects Pierre-August Guiauchain and Frederic Chass<U+00E9>riau designed new buildings apart from the Kasbah, town hall, law courts, buildings, theatre, palace of the Governor, casino ... to form an elegant walk bordered by arcades which is the boulevard today [[Che Guevara]] (ex-boulevard of [[Republic]]).

* ''' [[Kouba]] ''' ([[will daira]] of [[Hussein-dey]]): Kouba is an old village which was absorbed by the expansion of the town of Algiers. Of village, Kouba quickly developed under the French colonial era then continued growing due to formidable demographic expansion that Algiers knew after the independence of Algeria in 1962. It is today a district of Algiers which is largely made up of houses, villas and buildings not exceeding five stories.

* [[El Harrach]], a suburb of Algiers, is located about 10&nbsp;km to the east of the city.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Place-emir-abdelkader.jpg|thumb|left|Place emir abdelkader]] -->
* The communes of [[Hydra (Algiers) will|Hydra]], [[Ben Aknoun]], [[El-Biar]] and [[Bouzareah]] form what the inhabitants of Algiers call the heights of Algiers. These communes, sometimes famous knacks, shelter the majority of the foreign embassies of Algiers, of many ministries and university centers, which makes it one of the administrative and policy centers of the country.

* The street ''' Didouche Mourade ''' is located in the 3rd district Of Algiers. It extends from the ''' Grande Post office ''' to the Heights of Algiers. It crosses in particular the ''' place Audin ''', ''' the Faculty of Algiers ''', ''' The Crowned Heart ''' and ''' the park of Galland '''. It is bordered by smart stores and restaurants along most of its length. It is regarded as the heart of the capital.

==Local architecture==
[[File:Alger front de mer.jpg|thumb|Algiers waterfront]]

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole [[Kasbah]] quarter, Martyrs Square (''Sahat ech-Chouhada'' <U+0633><U+0627><U+062D><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0634><U+0647><U+062F><U+0627><U+0621>), the government offices (formerly the [[United Kingdom|British]] consulate), the "Grand", "New", and Ketchaoua [[Mosque]]s, the [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral of [[Notre Dame d'Afrique]], the [[Bardo Museum (Algiers)|Bardo Museum]] (a former Turkish mansion), the old ''Biblioth<U+00E8>que Nationale d'Alger''<U+2014>a [[Turkey|Turkish]] palace built in 1799<U+2013>1800<U+2014>and the new National Library, built in a style reminiscent of the [[British Library]].

The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into [[barracks]], and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a [[minaret]] and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.

The [[Great Mosque of Algiers|Great Mosque]] (''Jamaa-el-Kebir'' <U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0643><U+0628><U+064A><U+0631>) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], but reconstructed many times. The pulpit (''[[minbar]]'' <U+0645><U+0646><U+0628><U+0631>) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of [[Tlemcen]], in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by [[Moors|Moorish]] arches.

The New Mosque (''Jamaa-el-Jedid'' <U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+062F><U+064A><U+062F>), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a [[Greek cross]], surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is {{convert|90|ft|0}} high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the ''rue d'Isly'' near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun <U+0628><U+0627><U+0628> <U+0639><U+0632><U+0648><U+0646>. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the English residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, British consul in 1580.

[[File:Mosqu<U+00E9>e Ketchaoua.jpg|thumb|left|the Ketchaoua mosque]]
The Ketchaoua mosque (''Djamaa Ketchaoua'' <U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0643><U+062A><U+0634><U+0627><U+0648><U+0629>), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a [[portico]] supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of [[Moorish Empire|Moorish]] [[plaster]] work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of [[San Geronimo]]. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The [[Bardo Museum (Algiers)|Bardo Museum]] holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.
The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial<U+2014>the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of {{convert|235|acres|0|abbr=on}} (95&nbsp;[[Hectare|ha]]). An opening in the south [[jetty]] affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side.
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Hitlon-alger.jpg|thumb|Algiers Hilton Hotel]] -->
The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by [[Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa]] (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]]. The lighthouse which occupies the site of [[Fort Penon]] was built in 1544.

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a [[Defensive wall|rampart]], [[parapet]] and [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]], with two terminal forts, [[Bab Azoun]] <U+0628><U+0627><U+0628> <U+0639><U+0632><U+0648><U+0646> to the south and [[Bab-el-Oued]] <U+0628><U+0627><U+0628> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0648><U+0627><U+062F> to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of [[Bouzareah]] <U+0628><U+0648><U+0632><U+0631><U+064A><U+0639><U+0629> (at an elevation of {{convert|1300|ft|0}} above the sea) took their place.

[[Notre-Dame d'Afrique]], a church built (1858<U+2013>1872) in a mixture of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] styles, is conspicuously situated, overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the [[Bouzareah]] hills, {{nowrap|2 miles}} ({{nowrap|3.2 km}}) to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the [[archangel Michael]], belonging to the confraternity of [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fishermen.

The third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of "city of wellness". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be "agr<U+00E9>able for all those which will want to combine tourism and wellbeing or tourism and relaxation". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care, centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.

This {{convert|90|ha|acre|0|}} site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.

The fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abb<U+00E8>s, which will be located {{convert|25|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west from Algiers.

===1936 Algiers invitational football tournament===

In 1936 the local journalists association organised a four team invitational tournament in Algiers. With [[Algeria]] then under [[France|French]] colonial rule the official programme<ref>Back cover, 'Through the lens glimpses of Old Queen of the South', published by Dumfries and Galloway Libraries, Information and Archives with Queen of the South Museum, 1998</ref> listed the venue as "Stade-Velodrome Municipal d'Alger" and the participants as:-

Le [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] <U+2013> La Belle Equipe Ecossaise de Premi<U+00E8>re Division

[[Racing de Santander|Racing-Club de Santander]] <U+2013> Favori des Championnats d'Espagne

[[Floriana F.C.|Floriana F. C. de Malte]] <U+2013> Champion Officiel et Vainqueur de la Coupe

R.U.A. <U+2013> Champion de l'Afrique du Nord 1935

The match days were Thursday May 21 and Sunday May 24.

Home side Racing Universitaire d'Alger (R.U.A. for whom [[Nobel Prize]] winning author/philosopher [[Albert Camus]] had played in goals for their junior team) had already won both the [[North African Champions Cup]] and the [[North African Cup]] in the 30s (R.U.A. would win each twice by the decade's end).

==Climate==
Algiers features a [[mediterranean climate]] with warm summers and mild winters. Its proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that is experienced in the adjacent interior deserts. Algiers, like all mediterranean climates features wet "winters" and dry summers. Algiers on average sees roughly 430&nbsp;mm (17 in.) of precipiation per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April.
