'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''''' is a 2005 [[Comic science fiction|science fiction comedy]] film based on the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Douglas Adams]]. Shooting was completed in August 2004 and the movie was released on April 28, 2005 in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and on the following day in the United States and Canada.

The screenplay was begun by Adams, and completed by director [[Garth Jennings]] and [[Karey Kirkpatrick]] after Adams' death in 2001, and the film is dedicated "For Douglas".

==Plot==
The [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (fictional)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] ([[Stephen Fry]]) narrates that the [[dolphin]]s, the second most-intelligent creatures on [[Earth]], attempted to warn mankind (the third most intelligent creatures on the planet) about the planet's impending destruction, but humans interpreted the dolphins' communications as tricks. The dolphins left the planet, leaving their final message to humans as "[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish|So long, and thanks for all the fish]]." 

Earthling [[Arthur Dent]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) wakes up to find his house about to be demolished by bulldozers and attempts to delay them. [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] ([[Mos Def]]), his best friend, convinces Arthur to come to the pub to get some beer as a muscle relaxant. Ford tries explaining to Arthur that Ford is an alien from a planet in the vicinity of [[Betelgeuse]] working on the Hitchhiker's Guide, and that the Earth is going to be demolished. A [[Vogon]] planet destruction crew appears above Earth, announcing to humanity its impending demise to make way for a hyperspace expressway. Ford saves himself and Arthur by hitching a ride on a Vogon ship as the Earth is destroyed. The two are discovered, and as punishment are forced to listen to [[Vogon#Poetry|Vogon poetry]], the third-worst of its type in the galaxy. They are then thrown out the airlock, but are picked up by the starship ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'' before they [[asphyxia]]te.  Aboard the ''Heart of Gold'', they find Ford's "semi-half brother" [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] ([[Sam Rockwell]]), the President of the Galaxy who has stolen the ship, [[Trillian (character)|Tricia McMillan]] ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), an Earth woman that Arthur flirted with at a party before she left with Zaphod, and [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] (voiced by [[Alan Rickman]], acted out by [[Warwick Davis]]).

Zaphod explains that he seeks to visit the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], where he believes he can discover the Ultimate Question to [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything (42)|Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] to match with the Answer "42" given by the supercomputer [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]] (voiced by [[Helen Mirren]]). Zaphod stole the ''Heart of Gold'' to use its [[improbability drive]] to get to the planet by trial and error. During one of these attempts, they end up at the planet Viltvodle VI. Zaphod decides to visit Humma Kavula ([[John Malkovich]]), his opponent in the election. When Kavula learns of Zaphod's plan, he tells them he has the co-ordinates to Magrathea. Zaphod makes him an offer which he accepts, but demands they return with a [[Point-of-view gun]] created by Deep Thought, as well as taking one of Zaphod's two heads as a "hostage". As they are leaving the planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons, and the others travel to the Vogon homeworld to rescue her from the Vogon [[bureaucracy]]. The crew face spatula-like life-forms that slap conscious thoughts (in the tangible head), long lines, and the brunt of frustrating yet effective form processing. Before being rescued, Trillian learns that Zaphod signed the authorization for the destruction of Earth, because he thought it was a request for an autograph.

The ''Heart of Gold'' is chased by the Vogons, led by Galactic Vice-President [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Questular Rontok|Questular Rontok]] ([[Anna Chancellor]]), who is attempting to rescue Zaphod from himself.  The ''Heart of Gold'' arrives in orbit above Magrathea, and avoids its automated missile defense systems when Arthur triggers the improbability drive, changing the missiles into a whale and a bowl of petunias while miraculously surviving the side-effect of unstable jumps: permanent improbability. On the planet, Zaphod, Ford, and Trillian take a portal that takes them to Deep Thought. Upon asking the computer whether it has calculated the ultimate question, it reveals that it had designed another, greater supercomputer to do so: Earth. The trio later find the Point-of-View gun. Trillian uses the gun on Zaphod to make him understand how she feels about the destruction of Earth, and ends up realizing how much she needs/loves Arthur from Zaphod's mouth. Meanwhile, Arthur and Marvin miss traveling through the portal, and instead encounter a Magrathean called [[Slartibartfast]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) who takes Arthur on a tour of the "construction floor" where Earth Mark II is being built. Slartibartfast takes Arthur to his house where the others are waiting for him, enjoying a feast provided by pan-dimensional beings currently resembling a pair of mice. Arthur realizes he has fallen into a trap- the mice, beings that constructed Deep Thought, used the supercomputer to build an even larger supercomputer called "Earth" to determine the Ultimate Question, and Arthur, as the last remaining component of that computer, may have the Ultimate Question in his brain, which the mice intend to cut open to obtain. Arthur fights back, and whacks the mice into intelligent pancakes.

As the crew recovers outside the house they are surrounded by Vogons, and take shelter in a [[travel trailer|caravan]] as the Vogons open fire. Marvin, left outside, uses the Point-of-View gun on the Vogons, causing them to become very depressed and unable to fight. As the Vogons are taken away while Questular rejoins with Zaphod, Arthur realizes that he now has the opportunity to explore the galaxy with Trillian, and lets Slartibartfast finalize the new Earth without him. The ''Heart of Gold'' crew decide to visit "[[the Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]", though Marvin points out they are going the wrong way. The improbability drive is then activated.

==Production==
[[Image:Don't panic.JPG|thumb|Preparations for the premiere of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on Leicester Square]]
In a [[Slashdot]] interview, [[Robbie Stamp]], one of the film's [[executive producer]]s, noted the following about the cast of the film:<ref>[http://slashdot.org/articles/05/04/26/1952248.shtml?tid=97&tid=133&tid=214 Slashdot interview with Robbie Stamp.]</ref>
* The hardest character to cast was "the voice of the Guide itself and in the end came back to somebody who was one of the people Douglas himself had wanted, namely [[Stephen Fry]]."
* "Douglas himself is on record as saying that as far as he was concerned the only character who had to be British, indeed English, was [[Arthur Dent]]."
Stamp also commented on how large a role the studio and screenwriters other than Adams played in making the film:
* "I think that a lot of fans would be surprised to know just how much of a free hand we have been given in the making of this movie. I know how easy it is to see every decision to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always much more to do with pacing and rhythm in the film itself."
* "The script we shot was very much based on the last draft that Douglas wrote....All the substantive new ideas in the movie...are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him....Douglas was always up for reinventing HHGG in each of its different incarnations and he knew that working harder on some character development and some of the key relationships was an integral part of turning HHGG into a movie."

==Differences from preceding versions==
The sequence of events in the film generally resembles the story in prior editions. Although the radio series, books and TV series are famous for their inconsistencies, they each describe the same story until the characters get to [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], except for some narrative rearrangement. The movie also rearranges the narration, but to a far greater extent than any of the other media. Not only are scenes omitted and reworked, but entire new storylines, characters and locations are introduced, such as the Point-Of-View gun, which Trillian uses on Zaphod. Also when the main characters use the improbability drive the second time they go to a planet on which Zaphod's rival "Humma Kavula" resides. Humma Kavula (played by John Malkovich) is also a character not present in the earlier versions of the story.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
The film opened to mixed though generally favourable reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave it an overall score of 61%, while top critics (UK) gave it a better score of 75%,<ref>[http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy/?critic=creamcrop Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> with [[Metacritic]] giving 63%.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/hitchhikersguidetothegalaxy?q=hitchhiker's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The reviews at Metacritic.com]</ref> [[Empire (magazine)|Empire magazine]] said that it was "A very British, very funny sci-fi misadventure that's guaranteed to win converts",<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=9807 Review of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]</ref> although [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that "[The viewer] will hear dialogue that preserves the content of written humor at the cost of sounding as if the characters are holding a Douglas Adams reading", while noting that "I do not get the joke. I do not much want to get the joke, but maybe you will."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050428/REVIEWS/50413005/1023 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews]</ref>

The complete motion picture [[soundtrack]] was released as an [[iTunes Store|iTunes Music Store]] exclusive (in the US and UK) on April 12, 2005, two weeks before the scheduled CD release. The iTunes Music Store also has two further exclusive sets of tracks related to the movie:
*''The Marvin Mixes'' are remixes of a new version of ''[[Reasons To Be Miserable]],'' here performed by [[Stephen Fry]], as well as a new vocal and a new instrumental track for "[[Marvin (song)|Marvin]]," also performed by Fry. [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] had recorded the vocals of both tracks in 1981.
*The ''[[Guide Entries]]'' are new spoken "Hitchhiker's Guide" entries, all read by Fry, with accompanying music by [[Joby Talbot]] (with further orchestrations by [[Christopher Austin]]), who wrote the [[film score]].

The soundtrack CD was released on April 26, 2005, by [[Hollywood Records]], a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The CD has the same 33 tracks as the previous iTunes release. The enclosed booklet includes acknowledgements from Joby Talbot and notes on the creation of the song "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish," written by Garth Jennings.

The track "Huma's Hymn" on the soundtrack is notable for the fact that it was sung in St. Michael's Church in [[Highgate]], London by members of local church choirs along with a congregation consisting of members of the public. The recording was open to anyone wishing to attend, and was publicised on the internet, including in a post to the Usenet group alt.fan.douglas-adams.<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/5e102640862d2ec9 Message announcing the recording of "Humma's Hymn" on the alt.fan.douglas-adams newsgroup.]</ref>

The first version of the song "So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish" is a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style and lively version sung by the dolphins before they leave Earth. The second plays over the end credits and is in the style of 1950s male singers. The song was written by English composer [[Joby Talbot]], conductor [[Christopher Austin]], and Director [[Garth Jennings]] and performed by the [[Tenebrae (choir)|Tenebrae Choir]].  [[Neil Hannon]], founder and frontman of the Irish pop group [[Divine Comedy (band)|Divine Comedy]], lent his vocals to the version of the song played during the end credits. The song, in its "bouncy", opening version, was [[translation|translated]] into and performed in Spanish for the Latin-American [[DVD region code|Region 4]] [[DVD]] release.

==Home release==
The movie was released on DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on September 5, 2005. Both a standard double disc edition and a UK-exclusive "Gift Set" edition were released on this date. The standard double disc edition features:
* Making-of
* Additional guide entries, a collection of [[sound recording]]s read by [[Stephen Fry]], set to music by [[Joby Talbot]] and written by [[Tim Browse]] and [[Sean Soll<U+00E9>]] (with the exception of the ''How to be Cool'' entry, which was also co-written by [[Yoz Grahame]]). Four were released on the [[iTunes Music Store]] to promote the Hollywood movie version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and a fifth, the Guide to Websites, can be heard on the official UK movie website. 
* [[Deleted scene]]s
* Really deleted scenes (scenes that were never meant to be in the movie)
* Sing-a-long
* [[Audio commentary|Audio commentaries]]
* Set Top Games: Marvin's [[Hangman]]
* ''Don't Crash'' (68 minute UK exclusive "making of" documentary, directed by [[Grant Gee]])
The "Gift Set" edition includes a copy of the novel with a "movie tie-in" cover, and collectible prints from the film, packaged in a replica of the film's version of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' prop.

Single disc widescreen and full-screen editions (Region 1, NTSC) were released in the U.S. and Canada on September 13, 2005. They have a different cover, but contain the same special features (except the ''Don't Crash'' documentary) as the UK version.

Single disc releases in the [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] format for the [[PlayStation Portable]] were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.

The movie was made available as a paid download in the [[iTunes Store]] starting in September 2006, for the American market only. A region-free [[Blu-ray Disc]] version was released on January 2007.<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/061114/latu007.html?.v=74 Buena Vista Press Release]</ref>

==Marketing==
The film trailer featured voice over work by Stephen Fry as the Guide, describing the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''{{'}}s entry on movie trailers. 

The "Hitchhiker's Guide to Technology" claims that if you make yourself a cup of tea, and then attempt to get an object working, if the tea goes cold before you finish, you are dealing with technology. Other guides include the '''Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging''' and the '''Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines'''' and the '''Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool''' which  discusses how an individual can truly '''be''' cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''. The '''Guide to websites''' [http://www.hitchhikersmovie.co.uk HitchhikersMovie.co.uk] describes a website as "a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform you what they had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system". The ''''Guide to fanboys''', written by [[Touchstone Pictures]]' copywriters as part of their promotion of the movie, only ever appeared as website text. Though released at the same time as the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works.

==Awards==
The movie was nominated for seven different awards and won one. It won the Golden Trailer Award under the category Most Original.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Golden_Trailer_Awards/2005 Golden Trailer Awards for 2005 at IMDb]</ref> It was nominated for: the Artios award from Casting Society of America, USA under the category Best Featured Film Casting-Comedy in 2005; the Empire Awards from Empire Awards, UK under the categories Best British Film and Best Comedy in 2006; the Golden Trailer from Golden Trailer Awards under the category Best Voice Over; and Teen Choice Award from Teen Choice Awards under the categories Choice Movie: Action/Adventure and Choice Rap Artist in a Movie: Mos Def.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/awards Full list of all award nominations for] ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' at IMDb.</ref>
