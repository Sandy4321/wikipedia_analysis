The '''Alhambra Theatre''' in [[Openshaw|Higher Openshaw]], [[Manchester]], England, was opened in 1910, part of the H. D. Moorhouse Theatre Circuit, but it had been converted to a cinema by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. The auditorium was finally used as a sporting club,<ref name=RudyardWykeP26>{{Harvnb|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|p=26}}</ref> and what remains of the building is now used as a storage space and glass works.<ref name=TheatresTrust>{{Cite web |title=Alhambra (Manchester) |publisher=The Theatres Trust |url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/2248-alhambra-manchester |accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>
