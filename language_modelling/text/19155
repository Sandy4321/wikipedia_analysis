The '''Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special motorized vehicle''') was a [[Military of Germany|German]] [[half-track]] that saw very widespread use in [[World War II]]. Its main role was as a [[Prime mover (tractor unit)|prime mover]] for small towed guns such as the ''[[2 cm FlaK 30]]'', the ''[[7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegesch<U+00FC>tz 18|7.5 cm leIG]]'', or the ''[[3.7 cm PaK 36]]'' anti-tank gun. It could carry eight troops in addition to towing a gun or trailer. The chassis formed the basis for the ''[[Sd.Kfz. 250]]'' light [[armored personnel carrier]]. Approximately 14,000 were produced between 1938 and 1945, making it one of the most widely produced German tactical vehicles of the war. It participated in the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Invasion of Poland]], the [[Battle of France]], the [[Balkans Campaign]] and fought in [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russia]], [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]].   

==Description==
[[Image: Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-049-0176-14, Russland, Zugkraftwagen mit Nebelwerfern.jpg|left|thumb|A Sd.Kfz 10/1 gas detection vehicle being used to tow a 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 rocket launcher]]
The Sd.Kfz. 10 was a half-track vehicle with front wheels and a tracked rear suspension. Uniquely among German half-track designs it used a hull rather than a frame. Power was provided by a ''Maybach'' 6-cylinder, water-cooled, {{convert|3.791|l|cuin}} ''NL 38 TRKM'' gasoline engine of {{convert|90|hp|PS}}. It had a semi-automatic ''Maybach VG 102 128'' transmission with seven forward and three reverse gears. The driver selected the desired gear and initiated the shift by depressing the clutch. It could attain {{convert|75|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but the driver was cautioned not to exceed {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=j10>Jentz, p. 10</ref> In 1942 the [[Luftwaffe]] limited its vehicles to a non-tactical speed of only {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to extend the life of the rubber track pads (''Gummipolster'').<ref name=j22>Jentz, p. 22</ref> 

Both tracks and wheels were used for steering. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would be applied to the tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels mounted on swing arms sprung by [[torsion bar]]s. An idler wheel, mounted at the rear of the vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had transversely-mounted [[leaf springs]] and shock absorbers, the only ones on the vehicle, to dampen impacts.<ref name=j10>Jentz, p. 10</ref>

The upper body had a baggage compartment separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench seats on the sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.<ref>Jentz, p. 11</ref>

==Design and development==
Preliminary design of all the German half-tracks of the early part of the war was done by [[Diplom|Dipl.Ing.]] Ernst Kniepkamp of the ''Military Automotive Department (Wa Pr<U+00FC>f 6)'' before the [[Nazis]] took power in 1933. His designs were then turned over to commercial firms for development and testing.<ref>Spielberger, p. 24</ref> [[Demag]] was assigned to develope the "Liliput" ''Kleinster gel<U+00E4>ndeg<U+00E4>gngiger Kettenschlepper (smallest cross-country tracked towing vehicle)'' with the first ''D ll 1'' prototype being ready in 1934. It had a 6-cylinder {{convert|28|hp|PS}} [[BMW]] ''Type 315'' engine mounted in the rear and only had three roadwheels per side. The ''D ll 2'' followed in 1935 and kept the same engine, but added an extra roadwheel. It weighed {{convert|2.56|t|ton}}.<ref>Spielberger, p. 27</ref>

While the first two vehicles were only automotive prototypes the {{convert|3.4|t|ton}} ''D ll 3'' had a {{convert|42|hp|PS}} BMW ''Type 316'' engine mounted in the front, 5 roadwheels and a troop compartment that could fit six. The ''D 4'' prototype never left the drawing board before being succeeded by eight {{convert|3.85|t|ton}} trial series ''(Versuchs-Serie)'' ''D 6'' prototypes in 1937. This had a {{convert|83|hp|PS}} [[Maybach]] ''NL 38 TRK'' engine and a different transmission, but otherwise differed only in detail from the ''D ll 3''. Several ''D 6s'' and the ''D ll 3'' were used as prototypes for the models intended for service with ''Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen)'' and the ''Air Defense Troops (Luftschutztruppen)''. A series of 60 pre-production (''0-serie'') D 6s were ordered in 1937 from Demag, Adler and Mechanische Werke Cottbus (MWC) which differed only in details from the trial series. They were all delivered by November 1938.<ref>Jentz, pp. 5-8</ref> On 17 March 1937 the vehicle was renamed as the ''leichte Zugkraftwagen 1 to (Sd.Kfz. 10) (light 1 ton semi-tracked towing vehicle)''.<ref>Jentz, p. 1</ref>

The ''D 7'' was the mass-production model and differed mainly from the ''D 6'' by having different tracks and a ''NL 38 TRKM'' engine. The ''NL 38 TRK'' had proven to have too much compression for the 74 [[octane]] (''OZ 74'') gasoline decreed for use after 1 October 1938 and had to be modified with new cylinder heads and shorter pistons as the ''TRKM'', but this didn't change the engine's power.<ref>Jentz, p. 8</ref> Deliveries began in October 1938 with one of the first machines off the production line demonstrated for the Army on 11 October 1938.<ref>Jentz, p. 14</ref>. Early machines had two fuel tanks, one of {{convert|58|l|usgal}} and the other of {{convert|31|l|usgal}}, but they were replaced by a single {{convert|110|l|usgal}} tank early in the production run. The ''NL 38 TRKM'' engine was replaced in late 1939 by the ''HL 42 TRKM'' which differed little other than it had been bored out to {{convert|4.192|l|cuin}} to increase its power to {{convert|100|hp|PS}}.<ref>Jentz, p. 20</ref> During 1940 the hull rear was reinforced to allow the vehicle to tow heavier loads like the ''[[7.5 cm PaK 40]]'' [[anti-tank gun]], ''[[15 cm sIG 33]]'' [[infantry gun]] and the ''[[10.5 cm leFH 18]]'' [[howitzer]]. Later an air compressor was added for loads equipped with air brakes. These were designated as ''Model (Ausf<U+00FC>hrung - Ausf.) B''. In 1943 the semi-automatic transmission was replaced by a manual transmission. During 1943<U+2014>44 the original metal upper bodies were replaced with wood to conserve steel.<ref>Jentz, pp. 20-22</ref>

The ''D 7p'' chassis for the ''[[Sd.Kfz. 250]]'' light [[armored personnel carrier]] was based on that of the ''D 7'' with a shortened suspension, but actually shared very few components with it other than the engine.<ref>{{cite book

Demag was contracted to design a a new version of the ''Sd.Kfz. 10'' in 1944 with ten roadwheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler crank arm, an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed, two being delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. However development didn't proceed any further. Yet another new version of the ''Sd.Kfz. 10'' was proposed in the ''Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogram)'' of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.<ref>Jentz, p. 24</ref>

==Production==
Seven factories assembled various models of the ''Sd.Kfz. 10''. Demag built approximately 1075 from 1938 to November 1942. Adlerwerke completed 3414 between 1938 and December 1943. B<U+00FC>ssing-NAG built 750 between 1938 and December 1942. MWC assembled 4750 between 1939 and November 1944. M<U+00FC>hlenbau-Industrie A.G. (MIAG) completed 324 between 1939 and 1941. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hannover (MNH) built about 600 between 1939 and November 1942. Osterreicher Saurerwerke completed about 3075 from 1940 to December 1943. Both Demag and MWC were producing the ''D 7p'' chassis for the [[Sd.Kfz. 250]] light [[APC]] in 1945 when a shortage of armored bodies meant that 276 had to be completed with wooden upper bodies. 80 of these are known to have been delivered by 1 March 1945. These numbers may include 310 chassis built for ''[[Sd.Kfz. 252]]'' armored ammunition carriers and ''[[SdKfz 253|Sd.Kfz. 253]]'' oberservation vehicles.<ref>Jentz, pp. 14-17</ref>

==Variants==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L25668, Russland, Kettenfahrzeug.jpg|thumb|left|A Sd.Kfz. 10/1]]
===Sd.Kfz. 10/1===
The Sd.Kfz. 10/1 was a chemical detection vehicle. Before the outbreak of World War II only 90 were desired to be delivered 1940<U+2014>42 to equip the ''Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen)'', but the 3 May 1940 production plan mentions a total of 400 to be procured at rate of thirty per month and thereafter at ten per month. The last mention is a report that MWC was to complete ten vehicles by 15 January 1943. Production may have continued after that, but definitely not after the end of 1943.<ref>Jentz, p. 31</ref>

[[Image:SdKfz10-2.jpg|thumb|right|A Sd.Kfz. 10/2]]
===Sd.Kfz. 10/2===
The Sd.Kfz. 10/2 was a chemical decontamination vehicle fitted with a {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} capacity spreader and space for eight {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} barrels of decontamination chemicals. Each barrel could cover an area {{convert|1|by|160|m|yd}}. The barrels were stowed on platforms over the tracks with foldable outer rails. The 10/2 had a signficant number of differences from the standard model, including two fuel tanks totaling {{convert|86|l|usgal}}, one of which had a tunnel to accommodate the auxiliary driveshaft from the transmission to power the spreader. This reduced the road range to only {{convert|250|km|mi}}. The 10/2 was {{convert|4.83|m|ft}} long, {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} wide, and {{convert|1.95|-|1.7|m|ft}} high, depending if the top was up or down. It weighed {{convert|3890|kg|lb}} empty and {{convert|4900|kg|lb}} loaded. 2 crewmen were accommodated on a bench seat in front of the rear chassis wall. While spreading its top speed was only {{convert|10|-|20|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. 60 to 70 were built in 1938<U+2014>39.<ref>Jentz, p. 34</ref>

[[Image:SdKfz10-3.jpg|thumb|left|A Sd.Kfz. 10/3]]
===Sd.Kfz. 10/3===
The Sd.Kfz. 10/3 was equipped with a {{convert|500|l|usgal}} tank and spray system to lay down poison gas barriers. The spray nozzle swung band forth to cover a width of {{convert|16|m|ft}}. Approximately 67 were built in 1938<U+2014>39. On 15 April 1942 the ''Army High Command ([[Oberkommando des Heeres]] - OKH)'' ordered the tanks on the 65 vehicles in storage dismounted, the spray system disabled and the vehicles modified to carry 216 rounds of anti-tank ammunition. The vehicles were to be issued to rebuilding ''Nebeltruppen'' units.<ref>Jentz, p. 37</ref> By this stage of the war they were equipped with ''Nebelwerfer'' rocket launchers and had organic anti-tank guns.<ref>Niehorster, pp. 34-5</ref>

[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-055-1572-30, Frankreich, Zugmaschine mit Flak in Ortschaft.jpg|thumb|left|A Sd.Kfz. 10/4]]
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-665-6823-11, Russland, Flak auf Halbkettenfahrzeug im Erdeinsatz.jpg|thumb|right|A Sd.Kfz. 10/4 or 10/5 with ''Befehlspanzerung'']]
===Sd.Kfz. 10/4 and 10/5=== 

The Sd.Kfz. 10/4 carried the ''[[2 cm FlaK 30]]'' mount on a special platform with fold-down side and rear panels. This platform was specifically designed for the ''Flak 30'' mount and would not readily accept a ''Flak 38 mount'' or vice versa. To accommodate the gun mount the vehicle was both wider and taller than normal, namely {{convert|2.02|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|2|m|ft}} and weighed {{convert|4075|kg|lb}} empty. Some of these gun mounts had a [[gun shield]] fitted. The ready ammunition bins fastened to the side and rear panels (four on each side and two in the rear) contained one 20-round clip each. Four folding seats were fitted on the platform for the crew. It usually towed a ammunition trailer (''Sd.Ah. 51 - Sonderanhagen (special single-axle trailer'') with 640 more rounds, the gun sights and its rangefinder.<ref name=J44>Jentz, p. 44</ref> 

Vehicles built in 1940 (only) were fitted with removable loading ramps, cable rollers to act as pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a ''Flak 30'', mounted on a ''Sd.Ah. 51'' trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. ''Flak 38s'' were mounted on ''10/4s'' beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.<ref name=J51>Jentz, pp. 50-1</ref> 

The Sd.Kfz. 10/5 carried the ''[[2 cm FlaK 30|2 cm FlaK 38]]'' whose mount was wider, if lighter, than that of the ''Flak 30'', and the platform was enlarged to accommodate it from 1942. Vehicle width increased commensurately to {{convert|2.156|m|ft}}, but the height returned to that of the normal vehicle. Initially vehicles modified with the wider platform for the ''Flak 38'' did not have a special designation, but they were given one sometime in 1943. The earliest known use being 1 September 1943, but the older name lingered until 1 December 1944. The Luftwaffe ordered 293 sets of armor plate (''Befehlspanzerung'') for its vehicles in 1943. These plates covered the radiator, windshield and both sides of the driver's compartment and were fitted to both versions.<ref>Jentz, p. 51</ref> 

Production began in 1939 for deliveries to the Army and Luftwaffe, although the exact numbers will never be known as they were often not broken out separately in the production reports. At any rate Adler built 1054 between 1939 and February 1943, although some of these were completed as ''10/5s'' beginning in 1942. MWC was awarded two contracts for 975 ''10/5s'' to be delivered in 1943<U+2014>44, but 13 of these were delivered as ordinary ''Sd.Kfz. 10s'' in 1944.<ref name=J51>Jentz, pp. 50-1</ref>

[[Image:Bundesarchiv RH8II Bild-B0767-42 BSM, Peenem<U+00FC>nde, Feuerleitpanzer.jpg|right|thumb|A Feuerleitpanzerfahrzeug at [[Peenem<U+00FC>nde]]]]
===Field modifications===
Some vehicles were fitted with a ''[[3.7 cm PaK 36]]'' or ''[[5 cm PaK 38]]'' anti-tank gun, sometimes on a pivot mount. Sometimes they had the cab and engine compartment armored as well. The ''Pak 36'' was usually carried complete, but the ''Pak 38'' was usually mounted without its wheels.<ref>Chamberlain & Doyle, p. 182</ref> At least one was modified as a launching post for V-2 missiles as a ''Feuerleitpanzerfahrzeug''.

==Issue and use==
Initially it was planned to use the ''Sd.Kfz. 10'' as a towing vehicle for various light guns and trailers, but it was authorized as a substitute for the ''[[Sd.Kfz. 250]]'' light armored personnel carrier in 1939. The ''Ausf. B'' model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the ''[[5 cm PaK 38]]'' as well as their ammunition trailers. They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of motorized and tank units.<ref>Jentz, pp. 26-28</ref>

For the ''Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen)'' each decontamination battery (''Entgiftungs-Batterie'') was authorized six ''Sd.Kfz. 10/1'' and six ''Sd.Kfz. 10/2''. Eighteen ''Sd.Kfz. 10/3'' were held at the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their ''Sd.Kfz. 10/2s'' if needed. If necessary they could be substituted ''Sd.Kfz. 11s'' of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven ''Sd.Kfz. 10/1s'' were used to tow the ''28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41'' launchers and another was used by the platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their ''Sd.Kfz. 10/2s'' and used them just like the ''10/1s'' after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the ''10/3s'' were turned in when the unit was reorganized.<ref>Jentz, pp. 38-40</ref>

An early-war Army anti-aircraft company (''Flugabwehr-Kompanie'') was equipped in three platoons with a total of eighteen ''Sd.Kfz. 10/4s'', twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel ''[[2 cm Flakvierling 38]]'' was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four ''Sd.Kfz. 10/4s'' towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized with a total of eight ''Sd.Kfz. 10/4s'' carrying guns, two towing ''Flakvierlings'' and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. ''Sd.Kfz. 10/5s'' were substituted for ''10/4s'' on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.<ref>Jentz, pp. 62-3</ref>
