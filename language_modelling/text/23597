'''Scrip''' is any substitute for [[currency]] which is not [[legal tender]] and is often a form of [[credit (finance)|credit]]. Scrips were created as company payment of employees and also as a means of payment in times where regular money is unavailable, such as remote coal towns or occupied countries in war time.  Other forms of scrip include subway tokens, arcade tokens and tickets, and "points" on some websites.

Scrips have gained historical importance and become a subject of study in [[numismatics]] and [[exonumia]] due to their wide variety and recurring use. Scrip behaves similarly to a currency, and as such can be used to study monetary economics, as in the [[Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op]].

The word "scrip" is unfamiliar to many people and is often heard as "script".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==History==
[[Company scrip]] was a credit against the accrued wages of [[employee]]s. In the [[United States]], where everything in a [[mining]] or [[logging]] [[resources camp|camp]] was run, created and owned by a company, scrip provided the worker with credit when their wages had been depleted. These remote locations were cash poor. Workers had very little choice but to purchase [[meal]]s and [[product (business)|goods]] at a [[company store]]. In this way, the company could place enormous markups on goods in a company store, making workers completely dependent on the company, thus [[enforcement|enforcing]] their "[[loyalty]]" to the company. While scrip was a ''de facto'' form of currency, employees were rarely paid in scrip.  Additionally, while employees could exchange scrip for cash, it was rarely done so at face value. Scrip in this context was valid only within that area or town where it was issued. While store owners in neighboring communities could accept the scrip as currency, they rarely provided a 1 for 1 exchange. This was to avoid the risk of having coins/currency that were worthless anywhere else.

When U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]] issued his [[Specie Circular]] of [[1836]] due to credit shortages, Virginia Scrip was accepted as payments for federal lands.  

In nineteenth-century Western [[Canada]], the federal government devised a system of [[land grant]]s called scrip. Notes in the form of money scrip (valued at $160 or $240) or land scrip, valued at {{convert|160|acre|km2}} or {{convert|240|acre|km2}} were offered to the M<U+00E9>tis people in exchange for their Aboriginal rights.<ref>"Free Land!" in [http://www.collectionscanada.ca/immigrants/021017-2212-e.html Moving Here, Staying Here: The Canadian Immigrant Experience] at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], many local governments were forced to pay employees in scrip at the height of the crisis.<ref>Chatters, Charles H. "Is Municipal Scrip a Panacea?" ''Public Management'', March 1933</ref>

Scrip as a de facto form of currency within the setting of the mining or logging industry was discontinued around 1952.

Scrip is also related to the [[stock market]] where companies pay [[dividend]]s in the form of scrip rather than paying actual currency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  It is also a written document that acknowledges debt.

After [[World War I]] and the [[World War II|Second World War]], scrip was used in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]; detailed accounts are in [[Notgeld]].

During the American-Vietnamese War, as well as earlier during the Korean war, U.S. soldiers were sent on leave with a scrip marked with expiration dates which could be spent at establishments cooperating in the program.  This was done in part to encourage U.S. soldiers to seek their entertainment confined to these areas, but moreover was intended to deny Viet Cong "tax collectors" a prime source of revenue.  The expiration dates on these scrips frequently led to a rush by soldiers on leave to spend currency, as well as for soldiers who had not spent their scrip on leave to exhange their scrip with other soldiers heading out to leave for fresher scrip or hard cash, often at an exchange rate that rather favored the outgoing soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Thought should also be given to chips. Commonly used as currency with which to gamble, the use of chips as company currency in the early 1800s in Devon, England in [[Wheal Friendship]]<ref>[http://crying-fox.com/mine01.htm Crying-fox.com]</ref> copper mine gave its name to a local village: Chipshop.

==Modern use==

Scrip survives in modern times in various forms.

===Community-issued scrip===
[[Image:Detroit cheer.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detroit Community Scrip, 3 Cheers.]]
The use of locally-issued scrip accepted by multiple businesses within a community has increased  during the [[Late-2000s recession]].  Community-wide scrip usage has begun or is on the rise in [[Ithaca Hours|Ithaca]], [[Detroit Community Scrip|Detroit]], [[The Berkshires]], [[Pittsboro, North Carolina]], [[Traverse City, Michigan]], [[Lamar, Colorado]], [[Calgary Dollars|Calgary, Canada]] and [[Hagen|Hagen, Germany]].<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_bs291 Homegrown Stimulus]</ref><ref>Detroit cash keeps hometown humming ''Detroit News'', [http://www.detnews.com/article/20090323/BIZ/903230389/Detroit+cash+keeps+hometown+humming Detnews.com]</ref><ref>In Hagen you can pay with local currency, [http://www.wdr.de/themen/wirtschaft/geld-_und_kreditwesen/regiogeld/index.jhtml WDR.de]</ref><ref>Overview of Hagen<U+2032>s Notgeld, the Volmetaler, [http://www.volmetaler.org/ Volmetaler.org]</ref>

[[Thailand]]'s [[township]] [[Amphoe Kut Chum]], once issued its own local scrip called ''Bia Kut Chum'': [[Thai baht|Bia]] is [[Thai language|Thai]] for [[cowry]] shell, which was once used as small change, and still so used in metaphorical expressions. To side-step implications that the community intended their scrip as an unlawful substitute for currency, it now issues [[barter|exchange]] [[coupon]]s called ''[[Merit (Buddhism)|Boon]]'' Kut Chum.<ref>[http://www.angkor.com/2bangkok/2bangkok/forum/archive/index.php/t-2224.html A Boon to Kut Chum archive]</ref>

===Company-issued customer scrip===
Some companies still issue scrip notes and [[token coin]], good for use at company points of sale. Among these are the [[Canadian Tire money]] for the [[Canadian Tire]] stores and gasbars in Canada, and the [[Disney dollar]]s, used at [[Disney]] resorts.

===Gift certificates===

Scrip is now issued in the form of '''gift certificates''' (alternatively '''gift vouchers'''), or [[gift card]]s.  The two are essentially the same except that the cards automate the checkout and accounting processes.  Cards usually have a [[barcode]] or [[magnetic strip]], which can be processed through a standard electronic credit card machine. 

In the late 1980s, the term scrip evolved to include a fundraising method popular with non-profit organizations like schools, bands and athletic groups.  With scrip fundraising, retailers offer the gift certificates and gift cards to non-profit organizations at a discount.  The non-profit organizations sell the gift cards to member families at full face value.  The families redeem the gift cards at full face value, and the discount or rebate is retained by the non-profit organization as revenue.  [http://www.glscrip.com/index.aspx Great Lakes Scrip Center],  the nation<U+2019>s largest broker of scrip gift cards, reports that more than 4 million US households and 15,000 non-profit organizations use scrip fundraising. Canada's largest scrip fundraising company, [http://www.fundscrip.com Fundscrip], demonstrate scrip's popularity by boasting a 75% repeat purchase rate among groups seeking to easily support their respective causes. 

Gifts cards are increasingly being offered as consumer incentives at no cost or for a substantial discount.  For example, reward points given for the use of credit cards can be exchanged for a variety of gift cards and some companies will offer high value gift cards at a discount. Gift cards are readily available at a discount using online trading services.

There are websites that allow users to trade, donate, buy and sell gift cards. Sellers use these websites because the gift card is not to a store of their liking, and buyers because this provides opportunities to buy these cards for less than they are nominally worth at the business.

===Online games===

:''See also: [[Virtual economy]]''

Many online games ([[MMORPG]]s) provide a type of virtual currency that can only be earned within the game and/or be purchased with real legal tender from outside the game. Typically this currency cannot be exchanged for real legal tender after it has been acquired, but there are exceptions. Some games are free, but sometimes players are required to donate currency in exchange for additional items or gaming options, which can be traded among the gaming community and used as currency or traded back for real money. The ability to exchange real money for virtual currency or scrip and then back into real money raises a great many new issues, some of which parallel traditional issues with scrip and some of which are new.

While other online games may not provide scrip in the form of virtual currency or may not redeem it for real legal tender, an active market in trading virtual assets acquired in-game may still exist outside the game. In some cases, this may involve payments in real legal tender (''e.g.,'' trading of in-game assets on [[eBay]]). This, too, can be considered a modern form of scrip.

The amount of trade in these forms of online scrip can be very substantial, although the very nature of scrip strongly constrains its influence to the environment in which it was issued.  Nevertheless, as the amount of trade grows and its value in real-world currency increases, many new and unexplored economic, legal, and policy questions arise.

==Disadvantages==
Unless the gift card is obtained at a discount (paying less than the actual value of the card), some point out that trading real money for scrip is unproductive as it then ties up that money until it is used, and usually it may only be used at one store. Furthermore, not all gift cards issued are redeemed. In 2006, the value of unredeemed gift cards has been estimated at almost US$8 billion.<ref>[http://news.enquirer.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071202/BIZ/712020348/1076 "Gift cards popular, unused"], ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', December 2, 2007</ref>

[[VISA]], [[MasterCard]] and [[American Express]] gift cards are initially funded by a credit card or bank account, after which the funding account and gift card are not connected to one another. Therefore, once the predetermined funds are consumed, the card number expires. Gift card holders are thus able to make riskier Internet purchases, without the fear of having to persuade a merchant to stop pulling funds from them. VISA and MasterCard also have re-loadable [[debit cards]].

One disadvantage of gift scrip is that some gift card providers charge "maintenance fees" on the cards, particularly if they are not used after a certain period of time, or the card will expire after a given period of time.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07042/760921-68.stm "Gift cards may bear unwanted fees"], ''[[Post-Gazette]]'', February 11, 2007</ref>  Some provinces and states in North America (e.g. [[California]], [[Ontario]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Ohio]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]) have enacted laws to eliminate non-use fees or expirations,<ref>[http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_financial_services/003889.html "State Gift Card Consumer Protection Laws"], [[Consumers Union]], September 14, 2007</ref> but because the laws often only apply to single-merchant cards<ref>[http://www1.pressdemocrat.com/article/20071229/NEWS/712290331/1036/BUSINESS01 "Keeping the change"], December 29, 2007''[[Press Democrat]]''</ref> buyers have to review the gift card conditions prior to purchase to determine exact restrictions and fees.<ref>[http://www.rep-am.com/articles/2007/11/04/business/295328.txt "Card games: Read the fine print on gift cards"], ''[[Republican-American]]'', November 4, 2007</ref> Additionally, if a retailer goes bankrupt, gift cards can suddenly become worthless. Even if stores do not close immediately, the company may stop accepting the cards<ref>But what happens when the store files for bankruptcy? Instead of a gift you may be stuck with a worthless piece of plastic. Earlier this year, when Sharper Image filed for [[Chapter 11]], people holding its gift cards were told that they could not get their money back or use the card to make a purchase.[http://www.defendyourdollars.org/2008/09/gift_cards_the_gift_that_can_s.html "Gift Cards: The gift that can stop giving"], Defend Your Dollars, [[Consumers Union]], September 12, 2008.</ref> This became a significant issue during the [[Global financial crisis of 2008<U+2013>2009]], prompting the [[Consumers Union]] to call upon the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to regulate the issue.<ref>[http://consumerist.com/5049097/ftc-protect-gift-card-holders-when-companies-go-bankrupt "FTC: Protect Gift Card Holders When Companies Go Bankrupt"], Consumerist, September 12, 2008</ref>

==Military scrip==
[[Image:O-cash.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Examples of occupation and military scrip used on the British Channel Island of [[Guernsey]] during the German Occupation (1940-45)]]
Military personnel deployed abroad (protective or occupation) are generally paid in military scrip, which prevents legal tender from going into the [[black market]], plus it is an excellent way of keeping tabs on military payments and spending. For US Forces following WWII this was called MPC [[Military Payment Certificate]].  This type of scrip can be exchanged through the military for legal tender upon return to the home nation.  Military [[occupying power]]s have also been known to issue occupation scrip for local civilian use as a means of controlling the local economies.

==Scrip bid==
{{Main|Scrip bid}}
In Australia, the term "scrip bid" is used to describe a takeover offer where shares are offered partly or wholly in place of cash.  By receiving shares instead of cash the realisation of the capital asset can be delayed to take better advantage of capital loss offsets. Additionally, tax payers are only taxed on half the [[capital gains tax]] if they hold the asset for more than 10 months.
