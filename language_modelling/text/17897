The '''Homestead Grays Bridge''', also known as the '''(Homestead) High Level Bridge''', was built in [[1936]] and spans the [[Monongahela River]] between [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s Greenfield district. It is notable as the first bridge to utilize the [[Wichert Truss]], which uses a quadrilateral shape over each support. This made the truss [[statically determinate]], so that forces in the structural members could be calculated.

On [[11 July]] [[2002]], the Homestead High-Level Bridge was renamed the Homestead Grays Bridge in honor of the [[Homestead Grays]] baseball team.

The bridge is currently in disrepair, and has not seen major work completed since [[1979]]. Work began in [[January 2006]] to rehabilitate the bridge---the deck will be removed and the structure stripped down to the steel, then the steel will be repaired and a new, wider deck will be put on, giving drivers 3 feet more space on each side and pedestrians a slightly wider sidewalk. Finally, historically-accurate railings and lighting will be restored and the bridge will be painted.
