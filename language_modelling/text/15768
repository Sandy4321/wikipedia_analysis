ELAM's mission is dedicated to the training of [[general practitioner]]s and [[primary health care|primary healthcare]] providers for impoverished communities outside Cuba. The school is part of the international outreach through medical initiatives - which has previously included medical [[scholarship]]s - that has been important to [[Foreign relations of Cuba|Cuban foreign policy]] since the 1960s.<ref name = "Economist"/><ref>"[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/1081716281.html?dids=1081716281:1081716281&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jul+23%2C+2006&author=Cindy+Loose&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=W.12&desc=The+Cuban+Solution The Cuban Solution]", Cindy Loose, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' magazine, Jul. 23 2006</ref>

It is preferred that ELAM students come from the poorest communities with the intent of returning to practice in those areas in their countries. Initially only enrolling students from Latin America and the Caribbean, the school has also become open to applicants from impoverished and/or medically underserved areas in the United States and Africa.

Preference is given to applicants who are financially needy and/or "[[Colored#People of color|people of color]]" who show the most commitment to working in their poor communities.<ref name = "Journal"/><ref name = "USAToday"/><ref name = "Newsday">"[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/69093942.html?dids=69093942:69093942&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Feb+28%2C+2001&author=Ellen+Yan.+WASHINGTON+BUREAU&pub=Newsday&edition=Combined+editions&startpage=A.15&desc=Castro+Makes+a+Dream+Offer+%2F+Plan+for+free+medical+education+greeted+by+some+with+skepticism  Castro Makes a Dream Offer: Plan for free medical education greeted by some with skepticism]", Ellen Yan, ''[[Newsday]]'', Feb. 28 2001</ref><ref name = "Brochure"/>''

The Cuban medical training model emphasizes primary healthcare, [[community medicine]] and hands-on internship experiences.

Students are required to pass examinations at appropriate points during their course of study. For US students, this includes the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]].<ref name = "Brochure"/>

==History==
===Establishment===

ELAM was first conceived - reportedly from an idea by [[President of Cuba|President]] [[Fidel Castro]] himself<ref name = "NYTimes2">"[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/world/americas/08havana.html?ex=1170565200&en=73a331382e801ab9&ei=5070 Havana Journal; Hippocrates Meets Fidel, and Even U.S. Students Enroll]", Marc Lacey, ''The New York Times'', Dec. 8 2006</ref> - as part of Cuba's [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] and [[development aid]] response (known as the "[[Integral Health Plan for Central America and the Caribbean]]"<ref>[http://embacu.cubaminrex.cu/iframmeing/cuba/salud.htm Cuban Embassies official website], [[Ministry of External Relations (Cuba)|Cuban Ministry of External Relations]]; accessed Feb. 5 2007</ref>) to the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Georges]] and [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, which affected several countries in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]], including Cuba. 500 full medical scholarships per year for the next decade were offered by the Cuban government to students from 4 countries - the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] - seriously affected by the [[hurricane]]s. In support of this plan, ELAM was opened in March 1999 and started its full medical program in September 1999 with approx. 1,900 student in its initial classes. On [[November 15]], [[1999]], Castro officially [[inauguration|inaugurated]] ELAM at as Havana hosted the 9th [[Ibero-American Summit]] (at this time, ELAM had 1,929 students from 18 countries).<ref name = "IFCO">[http://www.ifconews.org/MedicalSchool/freq_asked_questions.htm Medical School Scholarship Program FAQ], IFCO website, accessed Feb. 2 2007</ref><ref name = "Philly"/><ref>"[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/46433963.html?dids=46433963:46433963&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+17%2C+1999&author=Serge+F.+Kovaleski&pub=The+Washington+Post&edition=&startpage=A.23&desc=Castro%27s+Guests+Give+Dissidents+a+Hearing Castro's Guests Give Dissidents a Hearing]", Serge F. Kovaleski, ''The Washington Post'', Nov. 17 1999</ref>

The first class of 1,498 ELAM doctors [[graduation|graduated]] on [[August 20]], [[2005]], together with 112 from other Cuban medical schools. 28 foreign countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, and including the United States were represented by the graduates. The ceremony was led by Castro and [[President of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]]. Also reportedly attending were [[Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda|Prime Minister]] [[Baldwin Spencer]] of [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[Prime Minister of Dominica|Prime Minister]] [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] of [[Dominica]], [[Prime Minister of Grenada|Prime Minister]] [[Keith Mitchell]] of [[Grenada]], [[President of Panama|President]] [[Mart<U+00ED>n Torrijos]] of [[Panama]], [[Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis|Prime Minister]] [[Denzil Douglas]] of [[St. Kitts & Nevis]] and [[Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Prime Minister]] [[Ralph Gonsalves]] of [[St. Vincent & the Grenadines]] as well as high-ranking government representatives of [[The Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], the Dominican Republic, [[Ecuador]], [[Grenada]], [[Guatemala]], [[Guyana]], [[Jamaica]], [[St. Lucia]], [[Suriname]] and [[Trinidad & Tobago]].<ref name = "MEDICC"/><ref name = "Pacifica"/>

===Cooperation with the United States===

In June 2000, a US [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (CBC) delegation visited Cuba to meet with Castro. [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Bennie Thompson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Mississippi|Miss.]]) mentioned to Castro that his district had a shortage of doctors, who responded by offering full scholarships for US nationals from Mississippi at ELAM. Later that same June, in a [[Washington, D.C.]] meeting with the CBC, the Cuban Minister of Public Health expanded the offer to all districts represented by the CBC. At a September 2000 speech event at [[Riverside Church]], [[New York City]], Castro publicly announced a further expanded offer which was reported as allowing several hundred places at ELAM for medical students from low-income communities from any part of the USA. Reports of the size of this offer varied in the US press - 250 or 500 places were suggested with perhaps half reserved for [[African-American]]s and half for [[Hispanic]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. The ELAM offer to US students was classified as a "cultural exchange" program by the [[United States State Department|US State Department]] in order to avoid the restrictions of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo against Cuba]]. The first intake of US students into ELAM occurred in the Spring of 2001, with 10 enrolling into the pre-medical program.<ref name = "IFCO"/><ref>"[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E14FB3A5D0C7A8CDDA00894D8404482 Summit in New York: The Cuban Leader; Friendly Crowd Provides Castro With a Soapbox]", Edward Wong and Chris Hedges, ''The New York Times'', Sept. 9 2000</ref><ref name = "LATimes">"[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/72094982.html?dids=72094982:72094982&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+1%2C+2001&author=MARK+FINEMAN&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=A.1&desc=8+Americans+in+Havana+Are+Med+Students+With+a+Mission 8 Americans in Havana Are Med Students With a Mission]", Mark Fineman, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', May 1 2001</ref><ref name = "USAToday"/>

In 2004, the legality of the presence of US students at ELAM was threatened by tightened restrictions against travel to Cuba by US nationals under the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]. A CBC campaign led by Representatives [[Barbara Lee]] (D-[[California|Calif.]]) and [[Charles Rangel]] (D-[[New York|NY]]) with 27 other members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] persuaded [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] to exempt ELAM from the tightened restrictions.<ref name = "Journal"/>

Applications from US citizens are administered through the New York City-based [[Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization]] (IFCO), headed by the noted [[human rights]] activist and critic of the U.S. embargo of Cuba, the [[Lucius Walker Jr.|Rev. Lucius Walker Jr]].<ref name = "LATimes"/>

===Cooperation with Pakistan=== 
<blockquote>
[[Cuba]] has also offered 1000 scholarship for the Pakistani students under the title of [[General and Comprehensive Medicine study]]. First batch of the approximately 384 student came from [[Pakistan]] to [[Cuba]] in the month of February 2007. These students are now present in the campus named [[M<U+00E1>ximo Santiago Haza (J-4)]] situated at [[Jaguey Grande]], a municipality of the Cuban province [[Matanzas]]. According to the [[ELAM]] administration this campus is also a part of [[ELAM]] and all the students will get their degree from [[ELAM]] after successful completion of their study. These students have completed the necessary [[Spanish language]] course and the pre medical course and have started their medical study from 10 December 2007. New students are expected to come very soon from Pakistan and two schools T-9 and J-6(situated in the same municipality [[Jaguey Grande]]) are reserved for these students, these campuses are also the official campuses of [[ELAM]]. According to the students, they are not provided with the facilities equal to [[ELAM]]. [[Cuban Government]] is trying to fulfil the demands of the Pakistani students but still the campuses for the Pakistani students lack many facilities that are present in the other campuses of [[ELAM]].The availability of Halal food for Pakistani Muslim students is the greatest threat. The Cuban Government has promised to fulfil this need of Muslim students.

===Collaboration with Venezuela===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ELAMVlogo.png|thumb|120px|ELAM A.P. R<U+00E9>ver<U+00E9>nd (Venezuela) logo]] -->
In August 2005, Venezuelan President [[Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez]] and Castro negotiated a healthcare agreement with Castro at a [[Summit (meeting)|summit]] in [[Sandino, Cuba|Sandino]] which included the building of an ELAM equivalent in Venezuela. The agreement was part of the trade and cooperation alliance between Cuba and [[Venezuela]] known as ''[[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas|Alternativa Bolivariana para las Am<U+00E9>ricas]]'' (ALBA). Attending ELAM's first graduation ceremony in the same month, Ch<U+00E1>vez publicly announced the plan and claimed that 100,000 doctors could be trained through the Cuban and Venezuelan ELAMs over 10 years - or even 200,000 if other Latin American countries joined the collaboration. A [[Medical Education Cooperation With Cuba]] (MEDICC) report on the announcement valued the projected 100,000 trained doctors as potentially a [[United States Dollar|US$]]20 to 30 billion contribution to the [[developing world]] and suggested that 30% of the places would be reserved for low-income applicants from Latin America and the Caribbean.<ref name = "Libre">"[http://www.nodo50.org/americalibre/novedades/korol_290506.htm ''La v<U+00ED>a campesina: sembrando revoluciones'']" ("[http://www.axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/article_22500.shtml The Peasant Path: Sowing Revolutions]") Claudia Korol (translated by Ron Ridenour), ''Am<U+00E9>rica Libre'', May 2006 (translated for AxisofLogic.com, Jul. 2006); accessed Feb. 4 2007</ref><ref>Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<U+00E1>vez's address at the Latin American School of Medicine graduation ceremony in Havana on Aug. 20 2005 broadcast by Cuban TV; from  "Venezuela's Chavez addresses medical graduation ceremony in Cuba", translated by [[BBC Monitoring|BBC Monitoring Americas]]; retrieved via [[Factiva]], Feb. 4 2007</ref><ref name = "MEDICC"/>
