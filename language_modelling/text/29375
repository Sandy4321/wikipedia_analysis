'''Witold Pilecki''' (13 May 1901{{spaced ndash}}25 May 1948; {{IPA-pol|<U+02C8>vit<U+0254>lt pi<U+02C8>l<U+025B>t<U+0361>sk<U+02B2>i}}; [[codename]]s ''Roman Jezierski, Tomasz Serafi<U+0144>ski, Druh, Witold'') was a [[Poland|Polish]] soldier, a [[rittmeister]] of the Polish [[Cavalry]] during the [[Second Polish Republic]], the founder of the [[Secret Polish Army]] (''Tajna Armia Polska'') [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|resistance]] group in German-occupied [[Poland]] in November 1939, and a member of the underground Home Army (''[[Armia Krajowa]]''), which was formed in February 1942. As the author of [[Witold's Report]], the first intelligence report on [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], Pilecki enabled the [[Polish government-in-exile]] to convince [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] that the [[Holocaust]] was taking place.

During World War II, he volunteered for a Polish resistance operation to get imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to gather [[HUMINT|intelligence]] and escape.  While in the camp, Pilecki organized a [[resistance movement]] and as early as 1941, informed the [[Western Allies]] of [[Nazi Germany]]'s Auschwitz atrocities.  He escaped from the camp in 1943 after nearly 3 years of imprisonment. Pilecki took part in the [[Warsaw Uprising]] in August 1944.<ref name="Were We All People?" /> He remained loyal to the London-based Polish government-in-exile and was executed in 1948 by the [[Stalinist]] [[secret police]] [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Urz<U+0105>d Bezpiecze<U+0144>stwa]] on charges of working for "foreign imperialism", thought to be a euphemism for [[MI6]].<ref name="tch">{{harvnb|Tchorek|2009}}</ref> Until 1989, information on his exploits and fate was suppressed by the [[People's Republic of Poland|Polish communist regime]].<ref name="tch" /><ref name="eh">{{harvnb|Piekarski|1990|p=249}}</ref>

==Early life==
Witold Pilecki was born 13 May 1901, in [[Olonets]] east of [[Lake Ladoga]] in [[Karelia]], Russia, where his family had been forcibly resettled by [[Imperial Russian]] authorities after the suppression of Poland's [[January Uprising]] of 1863<U+2013>64.<ref name="IPNweb">Lidia <U+015A>wierczek, [http://en.pilecki.ipn.gov.pl/portal/rpe/1025/8193/Rotamaster_Witold_Pilecki.html Pilecki's life] [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. Last accessed on 14 March 2009.</ref> His grandfather, J<U+00F3>zef Pilecki, had spent seven years in [[exile]] in [[Siberia]] for his part in the rising.  In 1910, Pilecki moved with his family to [[Wilno]] (Vilnius, [[Lithuania]]), where he completed [[primary school|Commercial School]] and joined the secret [[Zwi<U+0105>zek Harcerstwa Polskiego|ZHP Scouts organization]].<ref name="IPNweb"/> In 1916, he moved to [[Oryol|Orel]], Russia, where he founded a local ZHP group.<ref name="IPNweb"/>

During World War I, in 1918, Pilecki joined a ZHP Scout section of the Polish self-defense units under General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Wejtko]] in the [[Wilno]] area.<ref name="IPNweb"/>  When his sector of the front was overrun by the [[Bolshevik]]s, his unit for a time conducted partisan warfare behind enemy lines. Pilecki then joined the regular [[Polish Army]] and took part in the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919<U+2013>1920, serving under Major [[Jerzy D<U+0105>browski]].<ref name="IPNweb"/> He fought in the [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Polish retreat from Kiev]] as part of a [[cavalry]] unit defending [[Grodno]] (in present-day [[Belarus]]). On 5 August 1920, he joined the 211th [[Uhlan]] Regiment and fought in the crucial [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] and at [[Rudniki Forest]] (''Puszcza Rudnicka'') and took part in the [[Second Battle of Wilno (1920)|liberation of Wilno]].<ref name="IPNweb"/> He was twice awarded the [[Krzy<U+017C> Walecznych]] (Cross of Valor) for gallantry.<ref name="Whatfor">{{pl icon}} {{Wayback |date=20080115151254 |url=http://wilk.wpk.p.lodz.pl/~whatfor/biog_pilecki.htm |title=Detailed biography of Witold Pilecki on Whatfor }}. Last accessed on 21 November 2007.</ref>

After the Polish-Soviet War ended in 1921 with the [[Peace of Riga]], Pilecki passed his high-school graduation exams (''[[matura]]'') in Wilno and passed the exams for a [[non-commissioned officer]] position in the Polish Army.<ref name="IPNweb"/> He also studied at the [[Stefan Batory University]] in Wilno and rebuilt his family estate, ruined during the war.<ref name="IPNweb"/> He then took officer training courses.<ref name="IPNweb"/> He was assigned to a cavalry regiment in 1926 as [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], or the [[second lieutenant]] of the [[military reserve|reserves]]. While in the reserves, he actively supported local paramilitary training activities.<ref name="IPNweb"/> In the [[interbellum]], he worked on his family's farm in the village of Sukurcze and was known as a [[social work]] activist and an amateur painter.<ref name="IPNweb"/> On 7 April 1931, he married Maria Pilecka (1906{{spaced ndash}}6 February 2002), n<U+00E9>e Ostrowska. They had two children, born in Wilno: Andrzej (16 January 1932) and Zofia (14 March 1933). In 1938, he received the Silver [[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Cross of Merit]] for his involvement in the community and social work.<ref name="IPNweb"/>

==World War II==
{{Polish Underground State sidebar}}
Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, on 26 August 1939, Pilecki was mobilized as a cavalry-platoon commander.  He was assigned to the [[19th Infantry Division (Poland)|19th Infantry Division]] under [[J<U+00F3>zef Kwaciszewski]], part of the Polish [[Army Prusy]].<ref name="IPNweb"/>  His unit took part in heavy fighting against the advancing Germans during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] and was partially destroyed.<ref name="IPNweb"/>  Pilecki's platoon withdrew to the southeast, toward [[Lw<U+00F3>w]] (now L'viv, in [[Ukraine]]) and the [[Romanian bridgehead]], and was incorporated into the recently formed [[41st Infantry Division (Poland)|41st Infantry Division]], in which he served as divisional second-in-command under Major [[Jan W<U+0142>odarkiewicz]].<ref name="IPNweb"/>  During that conflict (known in Poland as the September Campaign), Pilecki and his men destroyed seven German tanks, shot down one aircraft, and destroyed two more on the ground.<ref>Jeremy Beadle, Ian Harrison, ''Firsts, lasts & onlys: military'', Anova Books, 2008

On 9 November 1939, the two men founded the [[Secret Polish Army]] (''Tajna Armia Polska'', TAP), one of the first underground organizations in Poland.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="l389">{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=389}}</ref>  TAP provided military expertise and leadership to the Armed Confederation (''Konfederacja Zbrojna'', KZ, the military arm of ''[[Konfederacja Narodu]]'' the Confederation of the Nation, KN).  Both KZ and KN were clandestine incarnations of the pre-war National Radical Movement (''[[National Radical Camp Falanga|Ruch Narodowo Radykalny]]'', also known as ONR-Falanga" <U+2013> a large extreme-right splinter group of the National Radical Camp). The leader of both KN and KZ was [[Boles<U+0142>aw Piasecki]].

Pilecki became organizational commander of TAP as it expanded to cover not only [[Warsaw]] but [[Siedlce]], [[Radom]], [[Lublin]], and other major cities of central Poland.<ref name="IPNweb"/>  By 1940, TAP had approximately 8,000 men (more than half of them armed), some 20 machine guns, and several [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|anti-tank rifle]]s.  Later, the organization was incorporated into the [[Union for Armed Struggle]] (''Zwi<U+0105>zek Walki Zbrojnej''), later renamed and better known as the Home Army (''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', AK).<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref>Richard C.

===Auschwitz===

{{main|Witold's Report}}
In 1940, Pilecki presented to his superiors a plan to enter Germany's [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] at [[O<U+015B>wi<U+0119>cim]] (the Polish name of the locality), gather intelligence on the camp from the inside, and organize inmate resistance.<ref name="l389" /> Until then, little had been known about the Germans' running of the camp and it was thought to be an internment camp or large prison rather than a [[death camp]].  His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of "Tomasz Serafi<U+0144>ski."<ref name="l390">{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=390}}</ref> On 19 September 1940, he deliberately went out during a Warsaw street roundup ([[<U+0142>apanka]]) and was caught by the Germans, along with some 2,000 innocent civilians (among them, [[Wladyslaw Bartoszewski|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Bartoszewski]]).<ref name="l390" /> After two days detention in the Light Horse Guards Barracks, where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber truncheons,<ref name="Pilecki 2012 460">{{cite book|last=Pilecki|first=Witold|title=The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery|year=2012|publisher=Aquila Polonica (US) Ltd|location=USA|isbn=978-1-60772-010-2|pages=460}}</ref> Pilecki was sent to Auschwitz and was assigned inmate number 4859.<ref name="l390" />
[[Image:Pilecki ausch f.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Auschwitz concentration camp photos of Pilecki (1941)]]
At Auschwitz, while working in various [[kommando]]s and surviving [[pneumonia]], Pilecki organized an underground Union of Military Organizations ([[Zwi<U+0105>zek Organizacji Wojskowej]], ZOW).<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="w1">{{harvnb|Wyman|1976|p=1148}}</ref> Many smaller [[Resistance movement in Auschwitz|underground organizations at Auschwitz]] eventually merged with ZOW.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="Foot"/> ZOW's tasks were to improve inmate morale, provide news from outside, distribute extra food and clothing to members, set up intelligence networks, and train detachments to take over the camp in the event of a relief attack by the Home Army, arms [[airdrop]]s, or an airborne landing by the [[Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade]], based in Britain.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="w1" />

ZOW provided the Polish underground with invaluable information about the camp.<ref name="w1" /> From October 1940, ZOW sent reports to Warsaw,<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=393}}</ref> and beginning in March 1941, Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=394}}</ref> In 1942 Pilecki's resistance movement were also broadcasting details on the number of arrivals and deaths in the camp, and the inmates<U+2019> state and their conditions using a radio transmitter that was built by camp inmates. The secret radio station, built over seven months using smuggled parts, was broadcasting from the camp until the autumn of 1942 when it was dismantled by Pilecki's men after concerns that the Germans might discover its location because of "one of our fellow's big mouth".<ref name="Pilecki 2012 460"/>

These reports (Witold's Report) were a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside. Such plans, however, were all judged impossible to carry out.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="Foot">M.R.D. Foot, ''Six Faces of Courage. Secret agents against Nazi tyranny. Witold Pilecki'', Leo Cooper, 2003, pgs. 117<U+2013>126</ref>  Meanwhile, the [[Gestapo]] redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref>Garlinski, Jozef, ''Fighting Auschwitz: the Resistance Movement in the Concentration Camp'', Fawcett, 1975, pgs. 191<U+2013>197</ref> Pilecki decided to break out of the camp, with the hope of personally convincing Home Army leaders that a rescue attempt was a valid option. When he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut the phone line and escaped on the night of 26/27 April 1943, taking with them documents stolen from the Germans.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1999|p=399}}</ref>

===Outside the camp===
After several days, he made contact with the Home Army units.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="Foot"/> On 25 August 1943, Pilecki reached Warsaw and joined the Home Army's intelligence department.  The Home Army, after losing several operatives in reconnoitering the vicinity of the camp, including the [[Cichociemni|Cichociemny]] [[Stefan Jasie<U+0144>ski]], decided that it lacked sufficient strength to capture the camp without Allied help. Pilecki's detailed report (''Raport Witolda'' <U+2013> [[Witold's Report]]) was sent to London, where the scale of Nazi atrocities at Auschwitz ("During the first 3 years, at Auschwitz there perished 2&nbsp;million people; in the next 2 years<U+2014>3&nbsp;million") was thought to be grossly exaggerated. The British authorities refused the Home Army air support for an operation to help the inmates escape.

The Home Army in turn decided that it did not have enough force to storm the camp by itself.<ref name="w1" /> In 1944, the Russian army, despite being within attacking distance of the camp, showed no interest in a joint effort with the Home Army and the ZOW to free the camp.<ref name="w2">{{harvnb|Wyman|1976|p=1149}}</ref> Until he became involved in the [[Warsaw Uprising]], Pilecki remained in charge of coordinated ZOW and AK activities, and provided what limited support he was able to offer to ZOW.<ref name="IPNweb"/>

On 23 February 1944, Pilecki was promoted to [[rotmistrz|cavalry captain]] (''rotmistrz'') and joined a secret anti-communist organization, [[NIE (resistance)|NIE]] (in Polish: "NO or NIEpodleg<U+0142>o<U+015B><U+0107> <U+2013> INdependence"), formed as a secret organization within the Home Army with the goal of preparing resistance against a possible Soviet occupation.<ref name="IPNweb"/>

===Warsaw Uprising===
When the [[Warsaw Uprising]] broke out on 1 August 1944, Pilecki volunteered for the [[Kedyw]]'s [[Chrobry II]] group and fought in "Mazur" platoon, 1st company "Warszawianka" of [[National Armed Forces]]. At first, he fought in the northern city center as a simple private, without revealing his actual rank.<ref name="IPNweb"/> Later, as many officers fell, he disclosed his true identity and accepted command.<ref name="IPNweb"/> His forces held a fortified area called the "Great Bastion of Warsaw". It was one of the most outlying partisan redoubts and caused considerable difficulties for German supply lines. The bastion held for two weeks in the face of constant attacks by German infantry and armor. On the capitulation of the uprising, Pilecki hid some weapons in a private apartment and went into captivity. He spent the rest of the war in German prisoner-of-war camps at [[Lambinowice|<U+0141>ambinowice]] and [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]].<ref name="IPNweb"/>

==Communist Poland==
[[Image:Pilecki photo 1947.jpg|thumb|250px|Photos of Pilecki from [[Mokot<U+00F3>w prison]] (1947)]]
On 9 July 1945, Pilecki was liberated from the POW camp, and soon afterwards he joined the [[2nd Polish Corps]], which was stationed in [[Italy]], where he wrote a [[monograph]] on Auschwitz.<ref name="IPNweb"/> As the relations between the [[Polish government in exile]] and the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] worsened, in September 1945, Pilecki accepted orders from General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Anders]], commander of the [[2nd Polish Corps]] (main unit of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]]) to return to Poland under a false identity and gather intelligence to be sent to the government in exile.<ref name="IPNweb"/><ref name="Foot"/>

Pilecki returned to Poland in October 1945, where he proceeded to organize his intelligence network.<ref name="tch" /><ref name="IPNweb"/> In early 1946, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] decided that the postwar political situation afforded no hope of Poland's liberation and ordered all partisans still in the forests ([[cursed soldiers]]) either to return to their normal civilian lives or to escape to the West. In July 1946, Pilecki was informed that his cover was blown and ordered to leave; he declined.<ref name="IPNweb"/> In April 1947, he began collecting evidence on Soviet atrocities and on the prosecution of Poles (mostly members of the Home Army and the 2nd Polish Corps) and their executions or imprisonment in Soviet [[Gulag]] camps.<ref name="Whatfor"/>

===Arrest and execution===
[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948-2jpg.jpg|250px|thumb|Pilecki in the court (1948)]]
[[File:Proces Pileckiego 1948.jpg|250px|thumb|Trial of Pilecki (1948)]]
On 8 May 1947, he was arrested by the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Ministry of Public Security]].<ref name="IPNweb"/> Prior to trial, he was repeatedly tortured. The investigation on Pilecki<U+2019>s activities was supervised by Colonel [[Roman Romkowski]]. He was interrogated by Col. [[J<U+00F3>zef R<U+00F3><U+017C>a<U+0144>ski]], and lieutenants: [[S. <U+0141>yszkowski]], [[W. Krawczy<U+0144>ski]], [[J. Kroszel]], [[T. S<U+0142>owianek]], [[Eugeniusz Chimczak]], and [[S. Alaborski]] <U+2013> men who were especially famous for their savagery. But Pilecki sought to protect other prisoners and revealed no sensitive information.<ref name="IPNweb"/>

On 3 March 1948, a [[show trial]] took place.<ref>[[#CITEREFStaff_correspondent1948|The Times 1948]]</ref> Testimony against him was presented by a future Polish prime minister, [[J<U+00F3>zef Cyrankiewicz]], himself an Auschwitz survivor. Pilecki was accused of illegal crossing of the borders, use of forged documents, not enlisting with the military, carrying illegal arms, espionage for General [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Anders]] (head of the military of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish Government-in-Exile]]), espionage for "foreign imperialism" (thought to be [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]]<ref name="tch" />) and preparing an assassination on several officials from the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland]]. Pilecki denied the assassination charges, as well as espionage (although he admitted to passing information to the [[II Polish Corps]] of whom he considered himself an officer and thus claimed that he was not breaking any laws); he pleaded guilty to the other charges. On 15 May, with three of his comrades, he was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]].  Ten days later, on 25 May 1948, Pilecki was executed at the Warsaw [[Mokot<U+00F3>w Prison]] on ''Rakowiecka'' street,<ref name="eh" /> by Staff Sergeant [[Piotr <U+015A>mieta<U+0144>ski]].<ref name=T-P>Tadeusz M.

During his last conversation with his wife he told her "I cannot live. They killed me. Because Oswi<U+0119>cim [Auschwitz] compared with them was just a trifle".
His final words before his execution at the Rakowiecka Prison in May 1948 were <U+201C>Long live free Poland<U+201D>.
<U+015A>mieta<U+0144>ski was nicknamed by prisoners the "Butcher of the Mokotow Prison".

Pilecki's conviction was part of a prosecution of Home Army members and others connected with the Polish Government-in-Exile in London.  In 2003, the prosecutor, [[Czes<U+0142>aw <U+0141>api<U+0144>ski]], and several others involved in the trial were charged with complicity in Pilecki's murder.
