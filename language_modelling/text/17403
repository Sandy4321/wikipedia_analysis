'''Xinghan Chen''' ({{zh|s=<U+9648><U+661F><U+6C49>|t=<U+9673><U+661F><U+6F22>|p=Ch<U+00E9>n X<U+012B>ngh<U+00E0>n}}), known as '''Jenova Chen''', is the designer of the award-winning games ''[[Cloud (video game)|Cloud]]'', ''[[Flow (video game)|Flow]]'', and ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'', and is co-founder of [[thatgamecompany]]. Chen is from [[Shanghai]], where he earned a bachelors degree in computer science and a minor in digital art and design. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he got a master's degree from the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC Interactive Media Division|Interactive Media Division]]. While there he created ''Cloud'' and ''Flow'', and met fellow student [[Kellee Santiago]]. After a brief period at [[Maxis]] working on ''[[Spore (2008 video game)| Spore]]'', he founded thatgamecompany with Santiago and became the company's [[creative director]]. The company signed a three-game deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], and has sold ''Flow'' and ''Flower'' through the [[PlayStation Network]]. Chen and thatgamecompany are currently working on ''[[Journey (video game)|Journey]]'', their third game for Sony.

As Chen was born in one culture and lives in another, he chooses to try to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games and thatgamecompany in general is to try to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire emotional responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does not think that it fits with their goals as an [[Independent video game development|independent video game developer]].

==Biography==
Chen was born in [[Shanghai]], and lived there until 2003.<ref name="NPRint"/> His parents were "a middle class family", and his dad worked in the software development industry, having previously worked on "one of the earliest giant computers in China".<ref name="TOTint"/> Although Chen was interested in art and drawing as a young child, his father influenced him towards computers, entering him in programming contests from when he was 10 years old. He found himself interested in video games that he saw there, but was not as enthusiastic about programming.<ref name="GSint"/><ref name="CBCint"/> While a teenager, he had deep emotional experiences with games that he played, which he ascribes to the fact that he was not as exposed to books, films, or life events that other people would have had those experiences with. These experiences drove him to try to create those types of feelings in games as an adult, when more emotional maturity had caused his "standards to rise" in what would move him in a game.<ref name="CBCint"/> It was during high school that he chose the English name [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Jenova|Jenova]] after a character in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', wanting a name that would be unique anywhere he used it as there were "thousands of Jason Chens".<ref name="TOTint"/>

He earned a degree in Computer Science & Engineering in [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]], which due to his background in computers he found "quite easy",<ref name="TOTint"/> but describes himself as spending much of his time there teaching himself digital art and animation, and later did a minor in digital art and design at Dong Hua University. Still interested in video games, he was involved in making three video games as part of a student group while in school.<ref name="GSint"/> Upon graduating, he had trouble finding a job in the Chinese video game industry that combined his interests of "engineering, art, and design",<ref name="GSint"/> and additionally felt that "very few games [had] actually achieved those qualities that would be interesting to an adult".<ref name="NPRint"/>

He then went to the United States to earn a master's degree in the [[USC Interactive Media Division|Interactive Media Program]] of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]] at the [[University of Southern California]].<ref name="NPRint"/> His intention at the time was to use the degree to get the kind of job he wanted back in China.<ref name="TOTint"/> At USC, he met [[Kellee Santiago]], another student in the same program, and the two decided to work together on games that would be outside of the mainstream.<ref name="NPRint"/> Their first game, which won a grant of twenty thousand dollars from USC to produce,<ref name="WIREDpiece"/> was ''[[Cloud (video game)|Cloud]]'', released in 2005, which "focuses on a young hospital patient who soars in his mind despite being trapped indoors".<ref name="WSJedito"/> The idea was partially based on himself, as when he was a child he was often hospitalized for asthma.<ref name="TOTint"/> It was designed as an attempt to "expand the spectrum of emotions video games evoke".<ref name="GSint"/> At a student showcase at the [[Game Developers Conference]], Chen and Santiago showed the game to a representative from Sony, John Hight, saying that it was the first game in the "Zen" genre. Hight was interested, though no deal was forthcoming.<ref name="NPRint"/> The game won the Best Student Philosophy award at the [[Slamdance Film Festival#Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition|Slamdance Guerilla Games Competition]] and a Student Showcase award at the [[Independent Games Festival]], and was showcased on [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike TV]], [[G4 (TV channel)|G4TV]], and [[CBS Sunday Morning|CBS Sunday]].<ref name="WIREDpiece"/>

Chen went on to do his master's [[thesis]] the following year in the concept of [[Dynamic game difficulty balancing|dynamic difficulty adjustment]], where the game adjusts how it reacts to the player based on the past and present actions of that player. Chen illustrated his ideas with ''[[Flow (video game)|Flow]]'', a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game made with Nicholas Clark.<ref name="JSint"/> The game involves the player guiding an aquatic [[microorganism]] through various depths of the ocean, consuming other organisms and evolving in the process. It was released in March 2006; it received 100,000 downloads in its first two weeks and by July had been downloaded over 650,000 times.<ref name="WIREDpiece"/><ref name="WSJedito2"/> A [[PlayStation 3]] version was announced in May 2006 as a downloadable game via the [[PlayStation Store]], and was released in February 2007. A version for the [[PlayStation Portable]], developed by [[SuperVillain Studios]], was released in March 2008.<ref name="SONYflowpsp"/> ''Flow'' became the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won Best Downloadable Game at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]].<ref name="VARIETYpiece"/>

After graduating, Chen and Santiago formed their own game company, [[thatgamecompany]], in [[Los Angeles]] where he still lives and signed a deal with Sony for three PlayStation Store games.<ref name="NPRint"/> The PS3 version of ''Flow'' was the first, and while it was in development Chen briefly worked for [[Maxis]] on the game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]''.<ref name="WSJedito2"/> Upon ''Flow''{{'}}s release, Chen returned to thatgamecompany and began working on their second game.<ref name="GSint2"/>

===Thatgamecompany===
The next game, ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'', was Chen and thatgamecompany's "first game outside the safety net of academia".<ref name="GAMAdevint"/> Chen was the creative director in charge of the game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer.<ref name="TGCabout"/> The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development.<ref name="GAMAdevint2"/> ''Flower'' was intended by Chen to primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as "an emotional shelter".<ref name="GAMAdevint2"/> Chen described the game as "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature".<ref name=Release/> He decided on a "nature" theme early in the development process, saying that he "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature."<ref name="EXCLAIMint"/> Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make ''Flower'' have the "emotional spectrum" that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a "fun" game, which would not provoke the desired emotions.<ref name="GAMACHENint"/>

After ''Flower'' was released to critical praise and awards,<ref name="BAFTA"/> Chen and thatgamecompany moved on to their next game, ''[[Journey (video game)|Journey]]''. ''Journey'' is intended by Chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games.<ref name="GSjourney"/> Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in ''Journey'' Chen intends for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players will have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose.<ref name="GSPOTjourney"/> ''Journey'' has not yet received a projected release date.

==Influences and philosophy==
Chen plays a wide variety of video games, but he names his greatest influences as ''[[Katamari Damacy]]'', ''[[Ico]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''. He also names ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' as an influence, and the game that he took his adopted name from.<ref name="JSint"/> As he was raised in China and works in America, Chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer. As such, instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture.<ref name="GSint2"/>

When Chen quit Maxis to re-join thatgamecompany, he did so knowing that it would mean talking less pay and having a less stable career. He felt, though, that it was important to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear. While Chen is not opposed to making action games, and his company has made internal "exciting" games that were well received at Sony, he feels that there is no point to thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers, as they would not be making anything new that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio.<ref name="GSint2"/> Similarly, Chen does not intend for thatgamecompany to make "big budget blockbuster games", as the pressure on profits that that entails would stifle the innovation that he wants thatgamecompany to focus on.<ref name="GIint"/> Chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film, the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games, similar to how film has thriller, romance, and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke.<ref name="CBCint"/>
