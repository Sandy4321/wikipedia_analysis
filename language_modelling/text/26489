==Club career==
===Darlington===
Reay started his career with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] on a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] contract and impressed so much so that he was given his first professional contract on 13 October 2006, an 18-month contract which would expire at the end of the [[2007<U+2013>08 in English football|2007<U+2013>08 season]]. Darlington's youth development director [[Mick Tait]] described him as "a lively striker who has been causing defenders all sorts of problems with his movement and pace".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~911570,00.html |title=Youth team players earn professional contracts |publisher=Darlington F.C. |date=13 October 2008 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref>  Shaun was given [[squad number]] 24 for the 2007<U+2013>08 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~1068277,00.html |title=Squad Numbers Confirmed |publisher=Darlington F.C. |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref>  Whilst at Darlington Reay studied for a [[BTEC]] in Sports Science at [[East Durham & Houghall Community College]] in [[Peterlee]], and was nominated for a [[Learning and Skills Council]] award by his club for continuing his studies at the same time that his football career was starting.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://readingroom.lsc.gov.uk/lsc/NorthEast/LSC0708_033.pdf |title=Striker nominated for Celebration of Learning and Skills Award |publisher=Learning and Skills Council |format=PDF |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=18 December 2008}}</ref>  He was also involved in a local road safety initiative, supported by Darlington F.C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darlington-fc.net/page/NewsDetail/0,,10339~1178429,00.html |title=Footballers Join Road Safety Drive |publisher=Darlington F.C. |date=28 November 2007 |accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref>
