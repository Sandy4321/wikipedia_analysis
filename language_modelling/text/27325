{{for|the modern station in the same town|Caernarfon railway station}}

'''Caernarvon railway station''' once served the county town of Caernarvon in [[Caernarvonshire]], Wales, now known as [[Caernarfon]] in [[Gwynedd]]. It was on the site of Morrisons store.  It was closed to passenger traffic on 5 January 1970<ref name="ButtCaernarvon">Butt, p.51</ref>, along with the branch from Menai Bridge (near [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]]). Following a fire that damaged the railway bridge over the Menai Strait, the branch and goods yard were temporarily reopened for freight traffic from 23 May 1970 to 30 January 1972. Following closure all the track was removed and the station completely demolished. 

When opened on 1 July 1852 (named "Carnarvon")<ref name="ButtCarnarvon">Butt, p.54</ref> it was the terminus of the [[Bangor and Carnarvon Railway]] and later an end-on junction with the [[Carnarvonshire Railway]] and the Carnarvon and Llanberis Railway. All three companies were operated by and absorbed into the [[London and North Western Railway]] by 1871. The route of the line southwards passed through a tunnel under central Caernarfon that was converted in 1995 for road traffic. The junction for Llanberis was on the outskirts of Caernarfon. The station was renamed "Caernarvon" on 27 March 1926<ref name="ButtCarnarvon"/><ref name="ButtCaernarvon"/>, but never adopted the Welsh spelling "Caernarfon" that is preferred today.

The [[Welsh Highland Railway]]'s modern-day [[Caernarfon railway station]] is on the trackbed of the Carnarvonshire Railway just south of the tunnel on St Helen's Road beneath the high retaining walls of Segontium Terrace.
