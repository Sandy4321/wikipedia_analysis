'''Pegasus 2''' or '''Pegasus II''', known before launch as '''Pegasus B''' was an [[United States|American]] satellite which was launched in 1965 to study [[micrometeoroid]] impacts in [[Low Earth orbit]]. It was the second of three [[Pegasus (satellite)|Pegasus]] satellites to be launched, following the launch of [[Pegasus 1]] three months earlier. The Pegasus spacecraft were manufactured by [[Fairchild Hiller]], and operated by [[NASA]].

==Spacecraft==
Pegasus 2 was a Pegasus spacecraft, consisting of {{convert|1450|kg}} of instruments, attached to the [[S-IV]] upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit.<ref name="GSP">{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/pegasus.htm |title=Pegasus 1, 2, 3|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> It had a total mass of {{convert|9058|kg}},<ref name="WCS">{{cite web|url=http://www.spacesecurity.org/files/WorldCivilSats2006.xls|title=World Civil Satellites 1957-2006|publisher=Space Security Index|work=|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> and was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data.<ref name="GSP"/> The panels were {{convert|29|m}} long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors.<ref name="EA">{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/pegasus.htm|title=Pegasus|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref>

Pegasus 2 was a secondary payload on the carrier rocket, which was carrying a [[boilerplate (rocketry)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo spacecraft]], [[A-104 (SA-8)|Apollo 104]] or BP-26,<ref name="LaunchLog"/> as part of a series of configuration tests for the [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo boilerplate acted as a [[payload fairing]] for the Pegasus spacecraft, which was stored inside what would have been the [[Apollo Service Module|Service Module]] of a functional spacecraft. Upon reaching orbit, the boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned.<ref name="GSP"/>

==Operations==
Pegasus 2 was operated in a low Earth orbit. On 3 July 1965 it was catalogued as being in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|508|km|nmi}} and an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|737|km|nmi}}, [[inclination|inclined]] at 51.6 degrees to the equator and with a [[orbital period|period]] of 97.15 minutes.<ref name="JSR-SC">{{cite web|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> Once in orbit, the panels were deployed to detect micrometeoroid impacts. Experiment results were returned to Earth by radio.<ref name="GSP"/> The spacecraft operated until 29 August 1968, and subsequently remained in orbit until it [[orbital decay|decayed]] and [[atmospheric reentry|reentered the atmosphere]] on 3 November 1979.<ref name="JSR-SC"/>
