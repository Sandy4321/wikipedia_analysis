'''Paul Christopher Lambert''' (born 7 August 1969) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] professional [[association football]] [[manager (association football)|manager]] and former player who is the manager of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].

Lambert won numerous honours as a player, winning the [[Scottish Cup]] with [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] as a 17-year-old, the [[UEFA Champions League]] with [[Borussia Dortmund]], all the Scottish domestic honours with [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and 40 [[cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].

He achieved success managing in England's lower divisions and guided Norwich into English football's [[Premier League]].

==Playing career==
===St Mirren===
Lambert started his playing career at [[Linwood Rangers Youth Club|Linwood Rangers Boys' Club]] in 1980 in his hometown of Linwood, before entering the professional game with [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in 1985. With St Mirren the 17 year old Lambert won his first senior winner's medal courtesy of the [[1987 Scottish Cup Final]]. Saints beat favourites and that season's [[1987 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]]ists, [[Jim McLean]]'s  [[Dundee Utd]], in what turned out to be the last time the [[Scottish Cup]] was won by a team composed entirely of Scottish players. Lambert played with St Mirren for eight years.

===Motherwell===

Signed by [[Tommy McLean]] for [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in 1993, the club finished third placed at the end of 1993/94 in the Scottish Premier League.

With [[Alex McLeish]] replacing McLean, in [[1994<U+2013>95 in Scottish football]] Lambert and Motherwell went one place better finishing league runners up, the club's highest finish since [[1933<U+2013>34 in Scottish football|1933/34]]. The club also had qualified for a place in the [[1994<U+2013>95 UEFA Cup]]. After eliminating [[Icelandic]] opponents, 'Well were drawn against [[Borussia Dortmund]] managed by [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]]. Drawn away in the first leg, Motherwell lost to a solitary goal by [[Andreas M<U+00F6>ller]] in the 58th minute. In the second leg Motherwell were still in the contest until [[Karl-Heinz Riedle]] scored twice in 10 second half minutes.

===Borussia Dortmund===
In 1996, Lambert was signed by a manager and club he had played against for Motherwell in the UEFA Cup, Ottmar Hitzfeld of [[Germany|German]] [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] side [[Borussia Dortmund]]. Hitzfeld deployed Lambert as the team's defensive midfielder. In Borussia winning the [[1997 UEFA Champions League Final]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], he played in midfield to quell the influence of Juve's French playmaker [[Zinedine Zidane]].<ref name = "wizard">[http://www.espnstar.com/rss-feed/detail/item617249/ "Paul Lambert <U+2013> The Norwich wizard" 4th May 2011 ESPN]</ref><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/norwich-city-manager-paul-lambert-on-his-vision-for-the-future-1.917708 "Norwich City manager Paul Lambert on his vision for the future" Sunday Herald, 6th Sep 2009]</ref><ref>[http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/michael-calvin/Ian-Holloway-Nigel-Pearson-Paul-Lambert-Kenny-Jacket-Keith-Hill-and-Eddie-Howe-the-British-Football-League-managers-capable-of-being-the-next-Roy-Hodgson-The-Michael-Calvin-Column-article411383.html "Revealed: The six British Football League managers capable of being the next Roy Hodgson" Mirror Football 1st May 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/205190/Mission-impossible-to-keep-new-boys-up/ "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP NEW BOYS UP" Daily Star 9th August 2011]</ref>  Lambert's cross also set up [[Karl-Heinz Riedle]]'s opening goal. Dortmund won 3<U+2013>1. Lambert's contribution has since been suggested as a man of the match performance.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/nov/25/joy-of-six-football-exports "The Joy of Six: British and Irish footballers abroad" 25 Nov 2011]</ref> He became the first British player to win the European Cup with a non-UK team, and the first British player to win the Champions League since its inception. Lambert had scored en route to the final with a [[1996<U+2013>97 UEFA Champions League group stage]] goal, the opener in a 2<U+2013>2 draw at [[Widzew <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]]. Lambert's performance in the semi final elimination of [[Manchester United]] was praised in the [[autobiography]] of [[Roy Keane]].

Lambert only scored one league goal with Borussia Dortmund, in a game against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]].

===Celtic===
In November 1997, after just over a year playing in the Bundesliga he was signed by [[Wim Jansen]] for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for a fee in the region of <U+00A3>2,000,000. The Scottish championship in his first season halted the run of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]', consecutive titles at nine, which equalled the nine in a row achieved by Celtic in the [[Jock Stein]] era.

During his time with Celtic, he won four [[Scottish Premier League]] titles, two [[Scottish Cup]]s, two [[Scottish League Cup]]s and was Scottish Football Writer's Player of the Year in 2002. Lambert captained the side that reached the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]] in [[Seville]]. Lambert's team were drawing 2<U+2013>2 after 90 mins but lost 3<U+2013>2 after extra time to [[Jose Mourinho]]'s [[F.C. Porto]].

===International career===

Lambert represented Scotland at age group level. Perhaps the best known of the contests was against the country who played a significant part in his career, Germany. The young Scots drew 1<U+2013>1 in Bochum in [[1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] quarter finals. In the return leg at [[Pittodrie]], Germany were two up after 40 minutes before [[Duncan Ferguson]] set up [[Ray McKinnon]] to pull one back before half time. Germany scored a third on the hour mark to seemingly put the tie out of reach. However in 68 minutes [[Gerry Creaney]] headed part [[Stefan Klos]] before Lambert himself equalised 10 minutes later. [[Alex Rae]] scored two minutes from time to clinch the game 4<U+2013>3.<ref>[http://www.afc.co.uk/articles/20100905/scotland-u21s-at-pittodrie_2212158_2144874]</ref>

As a full [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international, Lambert won 40&nbsp;[[cap (sport)|caps]], scoring one goal and in the latter part of his international career, captaining the side 15 times. His international debut was when at Motherwell and awarded by [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]] in the 1995 Kirin Cup against host country, Japan. Lambert played in a second game there 3 days later against Columbia.

It was when at Dortmund and in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign when Lambert started to appear as a regular. After missing the open game of the campaign away against Austria, Lambert appeared in October 1996 in the 2<U+2013>0 win in Latvia when he appeared as a 46th minute substitute. He was again a 46th minute substitute in the next qualifier, a 1<U+2013>0 home win against [[Sweden]]. For his next cap he was promoted to the starting line up for a 2<U+2013>0 home victory in the qualifier against Austria in which Lambert contended for man of the match. Lambert's only defeat of the campaign was the 2<U+2013>1 reversal in [[Gothenburg]] against Sweden before grinding out a June 1<U+2013>0 in Minsk against [[Belarus]], a 4<U+2013>1 win in Aberdeen against the Belarussians and a second 2<U+2013>0 win against Latvia, this time at home.

He played in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], turning in an impressive performance as the Scots lost 2<U+2013>1 to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[Stade de France]] in the tournament's opening match and also in the 1<U+2013>1 draw against [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in [[Bordeaux]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Lambert was part of the Scotland side to win a challenge game away against Germany in April 1999 with the goal scored by [[Don Hutchison]].

Lambert and Scotland qualified for a play-off place in the UEFA 2000 European Championship qualification campaign. However Lambert played in neither game due to being kneed in the face in the Celtic game the weekend before against Rangers. Craig Brown cited Lambert's absence as crucial to England's progression at Scotland's expense since he intended to deploy Lambert directly against [[Paul Scholes]], scorer of both England goals. As Brown said, <U+201C>The SPL went ahead with an Old Firm game a week before. I was furious because they did not legislate for a play-off, especially not for one against England. Predictably, we get a major injury and my holding midfielder, who performed with such distinction in the Champions League final for [[Borussia Dortmund]], cannot play. Barry Ferguson played brilliantly but he was not a holding midfielder. Scholes scored two goals and that was the guy Paul Lambert was going to pick up <U+2026><U+201D><ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/other-sports-news/england-0-scotland-1-is-it-really-10-years-since-don-hutchison-s-goal-at-wembley-1.932090 "England 0 Scotland 1: Is it really 10 years since Don Hutchison<U+2019>s goal at Wembley?" Heraldscotland.com]</ref>

His final cap with some irony was in an away game against Germany played in Dortmund (a 2<U+2013>1 defeat). Lambert had been awarded man of the match in the home encounter three months earlier at [[Hampden Park]] (a 1<U+2013>1 draw).

On 15 November 2009 he was inducted into the [[Scottish Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Eight-more-Scots-greats-enter.5826279.jp Eight more Scots greats enter Hall of Fame] The Scotsman, 16 November 2009</ref>

==Managerial career==
===Livingston===
After studying for football coaching qualifications in 2005, Lambert landed his first managerial job with [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] on 1 June 2005, assisted by [[Norrie McWhirter]].<ref>{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/4557885.stm | title=Lambert set for Livingston post  | publisher=BBC Sport | date=18 May 2005 }}</ref> Although he had not intended to play for his new club Lambert registered as a player in late August 2005 to cover for any injury shortages.<ref>{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/4155432.stm | title=Lambert re-registers as a player  | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 August 2005 }}</ref> His tenure ended the following February when he resigned after only winning two league games since starting the job.<ref>{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/livingston/4699226.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | date=11 February 2006 | title=Lambert stands down as Livi boss }}</ref>

===Wycombe Wanderers===
Lambert was appointed manager of English team [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] on 30 June 2006.<ref>{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/5132064.stm | title=Lambert named new Wycombe manager  | date=30 June 2006 | publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref> He led Wycombe to the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] semi-finals after defeating [[Premier League]] sides [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. The semi-final tie, against Premier League champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], saw Wycombe hold Chelsea to a 1<U+2013>1 draw at [[Adams Park]] before losing the away leg. This was the first time in over 30 years a fourth tier team had reached that stage of the League Cup.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Lambert resigned as Wycombe manager on 20 May 2008 following the club's elimination from the League Two play-offs by [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].<ref>{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/7410818.stm | title=Lambert resigns as Wycombe boss  | date=20 May 2008 | publisher=BBC Sport }}</ref>

===Colchester United===

On 9 October 2008, he was appointed as manager of [[Football League One|League One]] team [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] to succeed [[Geraint Williams]],<ref>[http://www.cu-fc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10424~1417363,00.html U's appoint Lambert]</ref> before winning his first game 2<U+2013>1 at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. Despite occasionally threatening to flirt with the League One play-offs, the U's eventually finished mid-table in Lambert's first season.

On 18 August 2009 he began the 2009/10 season with an opening day 7<U+2013>1 defeat of [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] before leaving the Essex club less than a year after taking over.

===Norwich City===
Lambert became the new [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] manager, replacing [[Bryan Gunn]], who was sacked by the club shortly after the 7<U+2013>1 defeat to Colchester.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/8204016.stm|title=Norwich appoint Lambert as boss |date=18 August 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref>  He led Norwich to the League 1 title and promotion to the Championship in April 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_2/8617895.stm | title = Charlton 0<U+2013>1 Norwich| accessdate=2010-04-17|date=2010-04-17|publisher = BBC Sport}}</ref>

On 1 June 2010, he signed an improved contract with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] after it was confirmed [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] were entitled to <U+00A3>425,000 in compensation, in addition to Norwich City being fined <U+00A3>75,000, with a further sum of <U+00A3>125,000 suspended for two years which will only be activated if Norwich breach Regulation 20<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/staticFiles/78/3/0,,10794~888,00.pdf |title=The Regulations of The Football League Limited |publisher=The English Football League|date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> again during that timeframe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11709_6184378,00.html |title=Sky Sports | Football News | League 1 | Norwich City | Lambert signs new Norwich deal |publisher=Sky Sports|date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}</ref> 

Norwich's fine form from their 2009<U+2013>10 promotion campaign continued into the [[2010-11 in English football|2010<U+2013>11 season]], and saw them gain a second successive promotion <U+2013> becoming the first team to achieve a second successive promotion at this level since [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] [[1999-2000 in English football|11 years earlier]]. During Lambert's first two season's in charge, Norwich City did not suffer two successive defeats in the league, in the same season.  They did, however, lose their final game in League One in 2009/10 at home to Carlisle and the opening game of their 2010/11 Championship season at home to Watford.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/9341899.stm | work=BBC News | title=Nelson deals with Norwich 'hype' | date=5 January 2011}}</ref> Their 1<U+2013>1 draw at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 3 January 2011 saw them enter the automatic promotion places on goal difference.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/9331351.stm | work=BBC News | title=Middlesbrough 1<U+2013>1 Norwich | date=3 January 2011}}</ref>

In January 2011, Norwich refused to allow [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] permission to try to secure Lambert as their new manager, following the dismissal of [[Brian Laws]].<ref name="nogo">{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/norwich/9346752.stm|title = Norwich reject Burnley approach for boss Paul Lambert  | publisher = BBC Sport| accessdate=7 January 2011| date = 7 January 2011}}</ref> The Norwich statement read, in part, "The club will fight tooth and nail to retain the services of Paul Lambert and his team during this critical period of the season and whilst they remain employed under a long-term contract".<ref name="nogo"/> When Norwich beat Ipswich 5<U+2013>1 at Portman Road, Lambert's record in East Anglian Derbies (including his time as Colchester manager) stood as played 6, won 4, drew 1, lost 1, scored 25, conceded 7. The 3<U+2013>3 draw and 1<U+2013>0 defeat were caused by Southend United, while Lambert was at Colchester. On 2 May Lambert and Norwich secured promotion to the [[Barclays Premier League|Premier League]] after a win over [[Portsmouth F.C|Portsmouth]], taking the second automatic spot with one game to spare. Lambert signed a new contract keeping him at the club during the summer.
