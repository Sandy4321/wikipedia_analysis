== Plot summary ==
[[Brian Griffin|Brian]]<U+2019>s cousin [[List of characters from Family Guy#Brian's family|Jasper]], who is [[gay]], comes to Quahog with his [[Filipino people|Filipino]] boyfriend Ricardo. They announce they are going to get married, causing [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] discomfort because she is conflicted about [[same sex marriage]]. [[Mayor Adam West]] reveals, in the city center, a solid gold statue of Dig <U+2019>Em, the [[Honey Smacks]] mascot and dedicates the statue to the servicemen who died in what he refers to as the "[[War in Iraq|recent Gulf conflict]]." The cost of the statue puts the city in debt. In order to distract the townspeople, he proposes a bill outlawing same sex marriage. Meanwhile, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] falls for Alyssa, a beautiful girl who belongs to the [[Young Republicans]], and joins the group to impress her.

Brian vows to stop West, getting 10,000 people to sign a petition to oppose the bill. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] refuses to sign and feeling spiteful about the situation takes [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to visit her parents. Before Brian can present the petition to the mayor, Chris burns it because Alyssa has agreed he may touch her [[Breast|breasts]] if he destroys the document. Brian gets 10,000 more signatures, but West does not change his mind. In an act of desperation, Brian takes a [[security guard]]<U+2019>s gun, and holds the mayor [[hostage]].

Lois hears about Brian on TV, and finds out that her parents do not love each other. They taught her to believe that a straight couple who do not love each other have more of a [[Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States|right to marry]] than a [[same-sex couple]] who love each other. She changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding love is more important. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor. Since the hostage situation has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West decides to cancel his ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a [[Volkswagen Scirocco]] and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.

[[Seth MacFarlane]] said he came up with the idea for the episode while writing a pilot with two gay men. He said it was "infuriating and idiotic" that two gay partners "have to go through this fucking [[Dog and pony show|dog and pony act]] when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" He said he is "Incredibly passionate about [his] support for the gay community".<ref name=Advocate>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid51793.asp?page=3|title=BGF: Seth MacFarlane|publisher=Advocate|author=Voss, Brandon|accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref> The episode was written by [[David A.
