'''USS ''S-6'' (SS-111)''' was a second-group (''S-3'' or "Government") [[United States S class submarine|''S''-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on [[29 January]] [[1918]] by the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on [[23 December]] [[1919]] sponsored by Miss Eleanor Westcott; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[17 May]] [[1920]] with Lieutenant Commander George B. Junkin in command.

Following trials and outfitting, ''S-6'' departed [[New London, Connecticut]], on [[18 November]] [[1920]] to join other [[S-boat]]s of Submarine Divisions 12 and 18 for what was to be, at that time, the longest cruise for American submarines on record. The trip, begun with a rendezvous off [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], took them through the [[Panama Canal]], to [[Pearl Harbor]] and then to [[Cavite]], [[Luzon]], [[Philippine Islands]]. Other submarines had operated out of Cavite prior to this but had been transported there on the decks of [[collier]]s.

The two submarine divisions operated from Cavite over the next three years, from the date of their arrival on [[1 December]] [[1921]] until [[29 October]] [[1924]]. During that time, they frequently visited Chinese ports at [[Shanghai]], [[Chefoo]], [[Chinwangtao]], [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]], [[Amoy]], and [[Woosung]].

On [[30 December]] [[1924]], ''S-6'' and her division (SubDiv 12) arrived at [[Mare Island, California]]. They operated along the West Coast until [[15 February]] [[1927]]; in the [[Panama Canal]] area during March and April; then returned to New London on [[3 May]] to operate along the [[New England]] coast. On [[17 December]], 
[[USS S-4 (SS-109)|''S-4'' (SS-109)]],
a unit of SubDiv 12, sank after colliding with 
[[USCGC Paulding (CG-17)|USCGC ''Paulding'' (CG-17, ex-DD-22)]], 
off [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. ''S-6'' then served as a training model to familiarize divers preparing to raise the sunken sub. ''S-4'' was raised on [[17 March]] [[1928]] and ''S-6'' resumed normal operations with her division. She conducted winter maneuvers in the [[Panama Canal]] area in 1929 and 1930, but primarily operated out of New London until decommissioned on [[10 April]] [[1931]], at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[25 January]] [[1937]].
