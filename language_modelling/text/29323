'''Baskerville''' ({{coor dms|31|48|0|S|116|01|08|E}}; [[List of postal codes in Australia|post code]]: 6056) is an outer northeastern rural suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], in the [[Swan Valley, Western Australia|Swan Valley]] region, 31 km from Perth's [[central business district]] via [[Midland, Western Australia|Midland]] and [[Great Northern Highway]]. Nearly all of it is under cultivation with [[viticulture]] being the main economic activity, and several well-established Swan Valley wineries are based here. Its [[Local Government Areas of Western Australia|Local Government Area]] is the [[City of Swan]].

==History==
The name Baskerville was given by William Tanner, a prominent Perth citizen and landowner, to [[Swan Land District|Swan]] Location 5 when he took up a grant there in 1831. He never lived on the properties, however, and left the [[Swan River Colony]] in 1835. In the 1880s, the land was acquired by [[Walter Padbury]], who employed his relative, Henry Hardwick, to manage it. In 1886 a homestead was built for him on what is now Memorial Avenue in the west of the suburb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofswan.com/heritage/view_municipal.asp?MUNICIPAL_ID=178|title=Heritage - Baskerville Homestead|author=City of Swan|date=[[14 December]] [[1995]]|accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref><ref name=dli>{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/corporate.nsf/web/History+of+metropolitan+suburb+names+-+B|title=History of suburb names - B|accessdate=2007-01-17|author=Department of Land Information}}.</ref>

After [[World War I]], the Government decided to commence a soldier resettlement scheme in the [[Swan Valley, Western Australia|Swan Valley]] region, and subdivided it into lots of about 10-50 [[acre]]s which would be operated as small farms. However, many of the soldiers had no agricultural experience, and sold the land to new migrants, particularly those from [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Italian Australians|Italy]] who had experience in [[viticulture]]. A 1953 map by a [[CSIRO]] viticultural expert shows nearly all of Baskerville was used for grape growing, with some citrus orchards on the riverfront near what is now Amiens Crescent.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourke|first=Michael J.|title=On the Swan : a history of Swan District, Western Australia|year=1987|publisher=UWA Press|location=[[Nedlands, Western Australia|Nedlands, WA]]|pages=306|id=ISBN 0=8556-4258-0}}.

Although the name of Baskerville was commonly in use for the area, it was not approved for the suburb until 1992.<ref name=dli/>

==Geography==
Baskerville is a narrow strip of land, starting on a curve in the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] and measuring approximately 800 m north-south by 7.5 km east-west, with Haddrill Road providing the centre line. A small area of native forest exists to the east of the suburb, accessible from Joshua Mews. No explicitly residential areas exist in the suburb.<ref name=streetsmart>Map 256-257, 2007 StreetSmart directory, Department of Land Information, Perth.</ref> The ABS 2001 census did not survey Baskerville.<ref>[http://www8.abs.gov.au/censusoutput/abs@CPP.nsf/CDbyGeogType!OpenView&Start=1&Count=1000&Expand=5&RestrictToCategory=State%20Suburbs#5 2001 Census Data by Location Name (State Suburbs)], Australian Bureau of Statistics, released [[19 November]] [[2002]].
