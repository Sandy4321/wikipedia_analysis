The '''Clutha River / Mata-Au''' is the second longest [[river]] in [[New Zealand]] and the longest in the [[South Island]]. It flows south-southeast {{convert|338|km|mi|}} through [[Central Otago|Central]] and [[South Otago]] from [[Lake Wanaka]] in the [[Southern Alps]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], {{convert|75|km|mi|}} south west of [[Dunedin]]. It is the highest volume river in New Zealand, and the swiftest, with a catchment of {{convert|21960|km2|sqmi|}}, discharging a mean flow of {{convert|614|m3/s|cuft/s}}.<ref name=flow>[http://www.fluvial.ch/u/niwa_full_text.html NIWA<U+2019>s use of Hydro2de]</ref><ref>http://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/ser/ser1997/html/chapter7.6.html</ref> The Clutha River is known for its scenery, gold-rush history, and swift turquoise waters. A river conservation group, the [[Clutha Mata-Au River Parkway Group]], is working to establish a regional river parkway, with a trail, along the entire river corridor. The name of the river was changed to a [[List of dual place names in New Zealand|dual name]] by the [[Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/hist_act/ntcsa19981998n97295|title=Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:On the Clutha River at Albert Town.jpg|thumb|right|On the Clutha River at Albert Town, near Lake Wanaka, Central Otago.]] 
[[Image:Upper Clutha Valley.jpg|thumb|float|Upper Clutha Valley, looking upriver toward the Southern Alps.]] 
The ultimate source of the river is at the head of the [[Makarora River]], close to the saddle of the [[Haast Pass]], which flows into the northern end of [[Lake Wanaka]]. The southern end of the lake drains into the nascent Clutha close to [[Albert Town, New Zealand|Albert Town]], where it is met by its first main tributary, the [[H<U+0101>wea River]], the outflow of Lake Wanaka's twin, [[Lake H<U+0101>wea]]. It is also met here by the [[Cardrona River]]. 

From here the river flows swiftly through the Upper Clutha Valley between ancient glacial terraces, negotiating a long section called the 'Snake' before reaching a rare switchback feature called the Devil's Nook near the town of [[Luggate]]. The river soon narrows as it passes through the Maori Gorge at Queensberry. Shortly thereafter it is joined by another tributary, the [[Lindis River|Lindis]], before widening as it enters [[Lake Dunstan]], an artificial lake created behind the massive [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[Clyde Dam|dam at Clyde]].

Fifty kilometres south of Lake Wanaka, the Clutha reaches the town of [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], which was substantially altered when the Clyde Dam project was commissioned in 1992. Here the river is joined by the waters of the [[Kawarau River|Kawarau]], which flows from [[Lake Wakatipu]]. Prior to the construction of the Clyde Dam, this river junction, known as the Cromwell Junction,<ref>[http://www.mightyclutha.blogspot.com]</ref> was renowned for the difference in colour between the two rivers<U+2019> waters.<ref>A pre-dam photograph of the junction, showing the brown Kawarau meeting the blue Clutha, can be seen at [http://mightyclutha.blogspot.co.nz/2010/09/cromwell-bridge.html this site].</ref>

The river then flows southeast through the inundated [[Cromwell Gorge]] to [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and nearby [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], where it is joined by the waters of the [[Manuherikia River]]. South of Alexandra the river widens again to form [[Lake Roxburgh]], another artificial lake, behind the [[Roxburgh Dam]], which was commissioned in 1956. The hydroelectric reservoir flooded the Roxburgh Gorge and several large rapids including the Molyneux Falls and the Golden Falls. The town of [[Roxburgh, New Zealand|Roxburgh]] sits close to the river, {{convert|120|km|mi|}} downstream from Lake Wanaka. 

From here the river continues southeast past the towns of [[Ettrick, New Zealand|Ettrick]], [[Millers Flat, New Zealand|Millers Flat]], and [[Beaumont, New Zealand|Beaumont]], before flowing through the Rongahere Gorge, which is admired for its native [[The Bush|bush]] corridor and for the Birch Island native reserve. Beyond here, the river is met by the [[Tuapeka River]] at Tuapeka Mouth. At this point the river turns southward, before being met by its last major tributary, the [[Pomahaka River]], which joins the Clutha {{convert|30|km|mi|}} from the coast. The river passes the town of [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]] before widening into the Clutha delta which contains the large flat island of [[Inch Clutha]]. Here the river divides into two [[distributary]] branches, the Matau (northern), which flows past [[Kaitangata, New Zealand|Kaitangata]], and Koau (southern). Both branches flow into the Pacific Ocean at Molyneux Bay.

The Clutha's average discharge is estimated at {{convert|614|m3/s|cuft/s}},<ref name=flow /> comparable to many much larger rivers. This heavy flow, combined with the relatively small size of the river in global terms, makes the Clutha notoriously fast-flowing, and it is often listed as one of the world's most swiftly flowing rivers, alongside Australia's [[Macleay River|Macleay]] and [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]]s, the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Atrato River]]s in South America, and the [[Teesta River]] in the Himalaya.

The waters of the Upper Clutha are clear turquoise, the result of glacial and snow-melt filtering when the water flows through Lake Wanaka. This is a rare characteristic for a high volume river. Below Cromwell, where the silt-laden [[Kawarau River|Kawarau]] enters, the waters are less turquoise.

===Beyond the river's mouth===
Such is the nature of the geology of the New Zealand region that the true river tells only half the story of the Clutha's course. Beyond its mouth, a submarine canyon system extends for over 100 kilometres into the South Pacific Ocean, eventually becoming the [[Bounty Trough]]. The canyon system bears a remarkable resemblance to the pattern of river and tributaries visible on land, so much so that many of the rivers which empty into the sea along the Otago coast can virtually be considered tributaries of the Clutha's submarine system. These rivers include the [[Tokomairiro River|Tokomairiro]], [[Taieri River|Taieri]], [[Waikouaiti River|Waikouaiti]], [[Shag River|Shag]], and even the [[Waitaki River|Waitaki]]. The quartz and schist geology of much of the Clutha River catchment leads to the river transporting white quartz material downstream and depositing this on coastal beaches. The general northerly current in the Pacific Ocean leads to this sand being transported and eventually deposited on beaches north to the [[Otago Peninsula]] and beyond. The Roxburgh Hydro Scheme provides a barrier to the transportation of this material which has been linked to the erosion of beaches further north, notably [[Ocean Beach, Otago|St. Kilda Beach and St. Clair Beach]], Dunedin, and along the Coastal Road at [[Kakanui]].

== History ==
The upper reaches of the river once abounded in flightless [[moa]], predated upon by the [[Haast's eagle]]. The river was known by the [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] as ''Mata-au'', meaning current or eddy in an expanse of water.<ref>{{ReedPlacenames1975}}</ref> This name, now more frequently rendered as ''Matau'', is still used for one of the two main channels of the Clutha delta. In the early days of European exploration there was at least one settlement of some 250-300 M<U+0101>ori close to the river's banks. The river takes its European name from ''Cluaidh'', the [[Scots Gaelic]] name for the [[River Clyde]] in [[Scotland]] which runs through [[Glasgow]]. During New Zealand's early colonial history it was known as the Molyneux, that name given to it by [[James Cook|Captain Cook]]. During early European settlement, a whaling station was established close to the river's mouth, and during this period the sea was the source of almost all of the area's economy.

===Gold rush===
The river featured greatly in the [[Central Otago goldrush]]. The first major [[gold]] deposits in Otago were discovered around the [[Tuapeka River]] at [[Gabriel's Gully]] by [[Gabriel Read]] in 1861, and the following year large amounts of the precious metal were discovered close to the site of modern [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]].

By [[Christmas]] 1861, 14,000 prospectors were on the Tuapeka and Waipori fields. The gold rush was short-lived, with most of the alluvial gold played out by 1863, but prospectors continued to arrive, swelling to a maximum of 18,000 miners in February 1864.<ref>McKinnon, M.

===Floods===
[[Image:Balclutha Bridge over the Clutha River.jpg|thumb|right|The Clutha passes under the third [[Balclutha Road Bridge]]. The first bridge at this site was destroyed during the flood of 1878.]] Several major [[flood]]s have occurred on the Clutha, most notably the <U+201C>Hundred year floods<U+201D> of 14<U+2013>16 October 1878 and 13<U+2013>15 October 1978. The 1878 flood is regarded as New Zealand's greatest known flood. During this, a bridge at Clydevale was washed downstream, where it collided with the Balclutha Road Bridge, destroying the latter. 

The 1978 flood, in which rivers from the [[Oreti River|Oreti]] in the south to the [[Tokomairiro River|Tokomairiro]] in the north breached their banks, led to the inundation of over {{convert|12000|ha|acre}} of land and the loss of over 21,000 livestock. Towns and areas affected stretched from [[Makarora]] in the north to [[Invercargill]] in the south. The town of [[Wyndham, New Zealand|Wyndham]] was completely evacuated, and the towns of [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] and [[Mataura]] were seriously affected with many residents moved. The small settlement of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]] on the banks of the [[Pomahaka River]] was completely abandoned and was not rebuilt once the waters subsided.<ref name="flood1">Lloyd, K. (1978) ''Flood disaster 1978.'' Dunedin.</ref>  At its peak, at 6.00 a.m. on the 15th, the Clutha's flow was measured at just over {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}}.<ref name="flood2">Lind, C.A. (1978) ''The 100 year flood - 1978.'' Invercargill: Craig Printing Co.</ref>

A major flood in 1999 caused serious damage to river communities, especially [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]]. The flooding in Alexandra was attributed to a rise in the riverbed, resulting from silt loading in the Roxburgh reservoir behind the [[Roxburgh Dam]] downriver from the town. The 1999 flood had significantly higher water levels in Alexandra than the 1878 flood,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.civildefence.govt.nz/MEMWebsite.nsf/Files/Chapter4/$file/Chapter4.pdf|title=Alexandra: A Practical Solution for Managing Flood Risk|first=Chris|last=Kilby|date=February 2001|page=4}}</ref> despite being only 80% of the volume of the latter.

== Water usage ==
[[Image:Clyde Dam.jpg|thumb|left|The Clyde Dam.]]
There are two [[hydroelectric]] power stations, the [[Clyde Dam]] and the [[Roxburgh Dam]], located on the river providing electricity to the New Zealand [[power grid]]. Other dams had been proposed in the past but the projects were cancelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/regions/central-otago/207479/contact-pulls-plug-dams|title=Contact pulls plug on dams|last=Ibbotson|first=Lucy|date=1 May 2012|work=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>

The Clutha also provides irrigation for [[stone fruit]] orchards around Cromwell, Alexandra, and Roxburgh, which provide apples, apricots, nectarines, cherries, and peaches. Several small [[viticulture|vineyards]] are also found in the upper reaches of the river.

The spectacular scenery of Central Otago makes the upper Clutha a popular holiday destination, especially for [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. [[Jetboat]]ing, [[kayaking]], [[rafting]], [[riverboarding]], and guided [[fishing]] occurs on the river, and [[waterskiing]], tandem [[parachuting]] and [[parapenting]] operators are all to be found in the area. The upper Clutha is also used for multi-sports events, and Lake Dunstan is an important [[Watercraft rowing|rowing]] venue. Several major [[skiing|ski courses]] are found close to the river. [[Curling]] is also played close to the Clutha in the harsh Central Otago winters.
