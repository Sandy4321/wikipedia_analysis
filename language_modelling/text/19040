'''Ann Bishop''' (19 December 1899 <U+2013> 7 May 1990) was a biologist from [[Cambridge University]] at [[Girton College]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], one of the few [[List of female Fellows of the Royal Society|female Fellows of the Royal Society]]. Her specialties were [[protozoology]] and [[parasitology]]. Her early work with [[ciliate]] parasites, including the one responsible for [[blackhead disease]] in turkeys, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her [[doctorate]], Bishop studied parasitic [[amoeba]]e and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases, such as [[amoebic dysentery]]. Her most well-known work is a comprehensive study of ''[[Plasmodium]]'', the [[malaria]] parasite, and investigation of various chemotherapies for the disease.

==Life==
Bishop was born in [[Manchester]], England on 19 December 1899.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} Her father, James Kimberly Bishop, was a furniture-maker who owned a cotton factory handed down to him after his father died. Her mother, Ellen Bishop (n<U+00E9>e Ginger), was from nearby [[Bedfordshire]]. Bishop had one brother, born 13 years later.{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=29}} She died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 90 after a short illness.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} Her lifelong association with [[Girton College]] prompted the placement of a plaque commemorating her life, whose inscription reads "''Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas''", [[Latin]] for "Happy is the one who has been able to get to know the causes of things".{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}}

==Education==
[[File:Girton College, Cambridge, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|left|Girton College, Bishop's alma mater, approximately 30 years before she attended]]
Bishop was [[homeschool]]ed until she was seven, and then went to a private elementary school until the age of nine.{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=29}} In 1909, ten years old, Bishop entered the progressive [[Fielden School]] in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. Bishop completed her high school education at the [[Manchester High School for Girls]]. Though she intended to study [[chemistry]], her lack of education in [[physics]] meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, Bishop matriculated at [[Manchester University]] in October 1918 to study [[botany]], chemistry, and [[zoology]].{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=29}} That first-year course in zoology sparked her lifelong interest in and commitment to the field. She graduated with honours from the School of Zoology, receiving her [[Bachelor's of Science]] in 1921; Bishop received her [[master's degree]] in 1922. During her undergraduate years,  under the tutelage of the [[helminthology|helminthologist]] R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied [[ciliate]]s acquired from local ponds.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}}{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=33}} Two years into her undergraduate career,{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} after winning the John Dalton Natural History Prize awarded by the University,{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=33}} she began work for another protozoologist, a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society]], [[Sydney J. Hickson]]. In 1932, she received her Doctor of Science degree. Bishop received her [[Ph.D.]] from Cambridge University in 1926 and in 1941, a [[D.Sc.]] These degrees were given in title only; women were not granted full degrees from Cambridge at this time.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}}

==Scientific career==
[[File:Entamoeba histolytica 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ''Entamoeba histolytica'' cyst, the subject of Bishop's early work.]]
Bishop's work with Hickson was her first major research effort, concerning the reproduction of ''[[Spirostomum ambiguum]]'', a large ciliate that has been described as "wormlike".{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}}{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=31}} In 1923, while working at Manchester University, Bishop was appointed an honourary [[research fellow]]. In 1924, she became a part-time instructor for the Department of Zoology at Cambridge,{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} one of only two women, both of whom were sometimes [[social exclusion|marginalized]].{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}} For example, she was not allowed to sit at the table with the men of the department at tea; instead, she sat on a first-aid kit.{{sfn|Goodwin|2004}} There, Bishop continued her work with ''Spirostomum'' as the only protozoologist on the faculty.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} She left that position in 1926, to work for [[Clifford Dobell]] at the National Institute of Medical Research; Bishop stayed there for three years.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} Under Dobell, Bishop studied [[parasite|parasitic]] [[amoebae]] found in the [[human gastrointestinal tract]],{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} focusing on the species responsible for [[amoebic dysentery]], ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]''. Dobell, Bishop, and [[Patrick Laidlaw]] studied the effects of amoebicides like [[emetine]] for the purpose of treating amoebal diseases.{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=32}}

The majority of her research career was spent at the Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, a part of Cambridge, where she returned in 1929. Bishop researched there until 1967.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} She was in charge of the Institute's Chemotherapy Research Institute, associated with the Medical Research Council, from 1947 to 1964.{{sfn|The Times - May 22, 1990}} Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell, as she studied [[nuclear division]] in parasitic [[flagellate]]s and [[amoeba]]e of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} She isolated one type of protozoans, [[aerotolerant anaerobes]], from the digestive tract of ''[[Haemopis sanguisuga]]'' during this period of her life. Bishop also discovered a new species, ''[[Pseudotrichomonas keilini]]'', which she named to acknowledge her colleague [[David Keilin]], and the parasite's resemblance to the genus ''[[Trichomonas]]''.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}}{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=33}} Her doctorate research at Manchester, with H.P. Baynon, concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey blackhead parasite (''[[Histomonas meleagridis]]''); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver.{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=33}} Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate ''Histomonas'' and then prove its role in blackhead.{{sfn|The Times - May 22, 1990}} Further work with parasitic flagellates and amoebae earned her a second doctorate, this time from Cambridge. Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the [[Second World War]]. Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her most well-known research, a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite (''[[Plasmodium]]'') and potential chemotherapies for the disease.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} 
[[File:Aedes aegypti.jpg|thumb|left|''Aedes aegypti'', a malaria vector]]
Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop studied the effects of various factors, including different substances in blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behavior of the malaria vector ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''. She also researched factors that contributed to ''Plasmodium'' reproduction.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} This work became the basis for modern research on a [[malaria vaccine]].{{sfn|Goodwin|Vickerman|1992|p=34}} During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research was essential for the British war effort because the most prevalent [[Antimalarial medication|antimalarial]], [[quinine]], was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the [[Dutch West Indies]].{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}} 

Bishop's work evolved to include studies of [[drug resistance]] in both the parasites and [[host (biology)|host]] organisms, the research that would earn her a place in the Royal Society. Significant work from this period of Bishop's life included a study showing that the parasite itself did not develop resistance to quinine, but that host organisms could develop resistance to the drug [[proguanil]]. Her ''[[in vitro]]'' research was proven accurate when the drugs she studied were used to treat patients suffering from [[tertian malaria]].{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} She also investigated the drugs [[maquin]] and [[atebrin]], along with proguanil, though proguanil was the only one shown to cause the development of drug resistance.{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}} Other studies showed that malaria parasites could develop [[cross-resistance]] to antimalarial drugs. Her research and experimental protocols were later used in [[rodent]] and [[human]] studies, albeit with modifications.{{sfn|The Times - May 22, 1990}}

Bishop received several [[Honorary title (academic)|honourary titles]] and fellowships during her career. In 1932, she was appointed a Yallow Fellow of Girton College, an honour she held until her death in 1990. Bishop was also a Beit Fellow from 1929<U+2013>1932. She was elected to the [[Royal Society]] in 1959{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=129}} and at one point was a member of the Malaria Committee of the [[World Health Organization]].{{sfn|The Times - May 22, 1990}} The [[British Society for Parasitology]] was founded in the 1950s, largely due to Bishop's efforts.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2000|p=130}} She was initially given only 5 [[pound sterling|pounds]] and a secretary to start the Society; in order to raise funds Bishop passed around a [[pudding basin]] at the Society's meetings.{{sfn|Goodwin|2004}} The society was originally a subgroup of the Department of Biology at Cambridge, but it became an independent group in 1960 and was headed by Bishop. Later that decade, the Department of Biology asked her to be the department head, but she declined because of the public nature of the role.{{sfn|Haines|2001|p=34}} For 20 years, the scientific journal ''[[Parasitology (journal)|Parasitology]]'' had Bishop on staff as an editor.{{sfn|The Guardian - 19 May, 1990}} In 1992, the British Society for Parasitology created a grant in Bishop's name, the Ann Bishop Travelling Award, to aid young parasitologists in travelling for field work where their parasites of interest are [[endemism|endemic]].{{sfn|Ranford-Cartwright|2006|p=2}}
