'''USS ''Milwaukee'' (CL-5)''' was an [[Omaha class cruiser|''Omaha''-class]] [[light cruiser]] built for the [[United States Navy]] during the 1920s. The ship spent most of her early career assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet|Asiatic]] and [[Battle Fleet]]s. In 1941 she was assigned to the [[Neutrality Patrol]] until she was refitted in New York in late 1941. She escorted a troop convoy to the Pacific in early 1942 before returning to the South Atlantic where she patrolled for German [[commerce raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s. In November, she intercepted one of the latter ships, but it [[scuttled]] itself before it could be captured. In 1944 she was temporarily transferred to the [[Soviet Navy]] and commissioned as ''Murmansk''. The ship was returned by the Soviets in 1949 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in December.

==Description==
[[File:Omaha class cruiser drawing.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Right elevation drawing and photo of ''Milwaukee'']]
''Milwaukee'' was {{convert|550|ft|m}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|555|ft|6|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|55|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a mean [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|1}}. Her [[Displacement (ship)#Standard displacement|standard displacement]] was {{convert|7050|LT|t|lk=in}} and {{convert|9150|LT|t}} at [[Full-load displacement|full load]].<ref name=w8>Whitley, p. 228</ref> Her crew consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.<ref name="f69">Friedman, p. 469</ref> The ship was fitted with a powerful [[echo sounder]]<ref name=danfs/>

The ship was powered by four [[Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division|Westinghouse]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam generated by 12 [[Yarrow boiler]]s.<ref name=w8/> The engines were rated at {{convert|90000|ihp|lk=in}} and designed to reach a top speed of {{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}.  At deep load she carried {{convert|1852|LT|MT|0}} of [[fuel oil]] that provided her a range of {{convert|6500|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f79>Friedman, pp. 78, 469</ref>

''Milwaukee'' mounted a dozen 53-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] [[6"/53 caliber gun|six-inch guns]]; four in two twin [[gun turret]]s and eight in tiered [[casemate]]s fore and aft.<ref name=w8/> Her secondary armament initially consisted of two 50-caliber [[3"/50 caliber gun|three-inch]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns in single mounts, but this was doubled to four guns during construction. ''Milwaukee'' was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 [[naval mine|mines]], but these were removed early in her career to make more space for crew accommodations.<ref>Friedman, pp. 80, 84</ref> The ship carried above-water two triple and two twin [[torpedo tube]] mounts for {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo]]es. The triple mounts were fitted on the upper [[deck (ship)|deck]], aft of the [[aircraft catapult]]s, and the twin mounts were one deck lower, covered by hatches in the side of the hull. These lower mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} guns to four, all mounted in the ship's waist.<ref>Whitley, pp. 228<U+2013>29</ref>

The ship lacked a full-length [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armor belt]]. The sides of her [[Engine room|boiler and engine room]]s and steering gear were protected by {{convert|3|in}} of armor. The transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s at the end of her machinery rooms were {{convert|1.5|in}} thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were only protected against [[muzzle blast]] and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor.<ref name=f79/> ''Milwaukee'' carried two [[floatplane]]s aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably [[Vought VE-7|Vought VE-9s]], but the ship operated [[Curtiss SOC Seagull]]s from 1935 and [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher]]s after 1940.<ref name=w9>Whitley, p. 229</ref>

===Wartime changes===
After 1940 the lower aft six-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over. The ship's anti-aircraft armament was augmented by two quadruple [[1.1"/75 caliber gun|1.1-inch gun]] mounts by early 1942, although these were replaced by twin [[Bofors 40 mm]] gun mounts later in the war. At about the same time, ''Milwaukee'' received eight [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]].<ref name=w9/>

==Service history==
===Inter-war period===
''Milwaukee'', the third ship named for the city of [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]],<ref name=danfs/> was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[Seattle Construction and Drydock Company]], [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on 13 December 1918, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 March 1921 and was completed on 20 June 1923.<ref name=w8/> During the ship's [[shakedown cruise]], she visited [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] during the [[Pan-Pacific Scientific Congress]] which opened on 23 August. With her new depth<U+2013>finding equipment, ''Milwaukee'' surveyed the floor of the Pacific en route. "The Milwaukee [[Seamount]]s in the Northern Pacific are named after a set of soundings taken by ''Milwaukee'' in 1929."<ref name=danfs>{{cite DANFS | title = Milwaukee | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m11/milwaukee-iii.htm | accessdate =11 January 2013 }}</ref>

During [[Fleet Problem]] VI, she collided with her [[sister ship]] {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|2}} in [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba, on 1 February 1926, although neither ship was seriously damaged.<ref>Nofi, p. 88</ref> ''Milwaukee'' and the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Goff|DD-247|2}} assisted victims of a fierce hurricane which had devastated the [[Isle of Youth|Isle of Pines]] in October 1926.<ref name=danfs/> She was assigned to [[Cruiser Division 2]] of the Asiatic Fleet in 1928.<ref name=w9/> During an engagement with "enemy" cruisers during Fleet Problem IX on 16 April 1930, the ship was ruled to have been knocked out by the exercise's umpires. Three years later, during Fleet Problem XIV, ''Milwaukee'' was spotted by fighters from the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and sunk by some of the opposing cruisers.<ref>Nofi, pp. 131, 170<U+2013>71</ref> In 1933, the ship was assigned to [[Cruiser Division 3]] of the Battle Fleet.<ref name=w9/> After the [[Panay Incident]] in December 1937, ''Milwaukee'' made a cruise through the Western Pacific from January to April 1938.<ref name=danfs/>

While steaming north of [[Hispaniola]] and [[Puerto Rico]] on 14 February 1939, ''Milwaukee'' discovered the deepest place in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The spot<U+2014>which has a depth of {{convert|28680|ft|m}}<U+2014>is now known as the "[[Milwaukee Deep]]".<ref name=danfs/> By January 1941, the ship had returned to Cruiser Division 2 which was now assigned to the Caribbean Patrol, commanded by [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Jonas H. Ingram]],<ref>United States Navy, p. 9</ref> part of the Neutrality Patrol established after the war began.<ref name=w9/> Cruiser Division 2 was ordered to patrol the Atlantic between [[Trinidad]], the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and the eastern bulge of Brazil in April, although ''Milwaukee'' was not immediately available. The ship, escorted by the destroyers {{USS|Somers|DD-381|2}} and {{USS|Jouett|DD-396|2}}, began her first patrol in May, making a port visit to [[Recife]], Brazil on 1 June, before returning to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. These patrols continued in the same manner for most of the rest of the year.<ref>United States Navy, pp. 9, 16</ref>

===World War II===
====South Atlantic====
''Milwaukee'', commanded by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Forrest B. Royal]], was being [[wikt:overhaul|overhauled]] in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] when the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December. The ship escorted a convoy to the [[Caribbean]] from New York on 31 December and then escorted eight troop transports from the [[Panama Canal]] to the [[Society Islands]]. She rejoined the South Atlantic Patrol Force upon her return and spend the next two years making patrols between Brazil and the African coast. On 19 May she received an [[SOS]] from the Brazilian cargo ship SS ''Commandante Lyra'', which had been torpedoed by the {{Ship|Italian submarine|Barbarigo}} off the coast of Brazil. ''Milwaukee'' found the freighter abandoned, burning, and [[list (watercraft)|listing]] to port. She rescued 25 survivors from their [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s, including the ship's master. Reinforced by the cruiser's sister {{USS|Omaha|CL-4|2}} and the destroyer {{USS|McDougal|DD-358|2}}, the fires were brought under control, cargo was jettisoned to lighten the ship, and ''Commandante Lyra'' was towed to [[Fortaleza]], Brazil.<ref name=danfs/>

Rear Admiral [[O. M. Read]] assumed command of Cruiser Division 2 in October and hoisted his flag aboard ''Milwaukee''.<ref>United States Navy, p. 84</ref> On 21 November, ''Milwaukee'', her sister {{USS|Cincinnati|CL-6|2}} and the destroyer ''Somers'' intercepted the German blockade runner {{MS|Anneliese Essberger|1935|2}}. When ''Somers'' had closed to {{convert|4|mi|nmi km}}, the German ship scuttled herself to prevent capture.<ref>Rohwer, p. 214</ref> ''Milwaukee'' rescued 62 of the ship's crew. On 2 May 1943, while the ship was under repair at Recife, her crew helped to fight a fire on the [[oil tanker]] SS ''Livingston Roe''.<ref name=danfs/> ''Milwaukee'' and ''Omaha'' collided on 31 May off the coast of Brazil, although the extent of the damage is not known.<ref>Rohwer, p. 253</ref> The ship sailed for the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 8 February 1944,<ref name=danfs/> preparatory to her temporary transfer to the Soviet Union in lieu of Italian ships allotted after the Italian surrender that could not be delivered.<ref>Whitley, p. 230</ref> She escorted a convoy to [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] on 8 March before forming part of the escort of [[Convoy JW 58]] during her voyage to ''Murmansk'' beginning on 29 March.<ref name=danfs/>

===Soviet service===
On 20 April, the ship was transferred on loan to the Soviet [[Soviet Red Banner Northern Fleet|Northern Fleet]] in [[Murmansk]]. She was commissioned in the Soviet Navy as ''Murmansk'' and performed convoy and patrol duty in the [[Arctic Ocean]] for the remainder of the war. Afterward, she became a training ship and participated in the 1948 fleet maneuvers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frampton|first=Victor|date=2008| title=Question 39/44: USS Milwaukee in Soviet Service|journal=Warship International|publisher= International Naval Research Organization|location=Holden, MA|volume=XLV|issue=4|pages=284<U+2013>85|issn= 0043-0374}}</ref> The Soviets returned the ship on 16 March 1949 and ''Milwaukee'' was sold for scrap to American Shipbreakers, Inc., in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] on 10 December.<ref name=danfs/>
