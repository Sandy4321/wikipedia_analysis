'''John de Gray''' (died 18 October 1214) was a medieval English [[Bishop of Norwich]], as well as being elected [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but was never confirmed as archbishop. He was employed in the service of [[John of England]] both prior to John becoming king as well as afterwards, being rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices culminating with his ''[[pro forma]]'' election to Norwich in 1200. De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the [[episcopate]], loaning the king money as well as serving on diplomatic missions. In 1205, King John wished to reward de Gray with a [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translation]] to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|archbishopric of Canterbury]], but a disputed election process led to de Gray's selection being quashed by Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1206.

Innocent then consecrated [[Stephen Langton]] as archbishop against John's wishes, leading to a long dispute between the papacy and the king. This in turn led to various papal sanctions against England and John; at one point resulting in de Gray being one of only two valid bishops still operating in England. In 1209, however, de Gray became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons, as well as the native Irish. Recalled to England in 1213 to help with a threatened invasion of England by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's attempted elevation to Canterbury in 1205. After securing a pardon, de Gray was appointed as [[Bishop of Durham]], but he died in October 1214 while returning to England from Rome, before he could be installed at Durham.

De Gray was the uncle of [[Walter de Gray]], who secured the office of [[Lord Chancellor]] with his uncle's help in 1205. Besides his royal service, the bishop also built a palace in his diocese as well as several castles in Ireland. Although reviled by one contemporary writer as an "evil counsellor" to the king,<ref name=QDNB/> modern historians have been more forgiving, with one praising his intelligence and others stating that de Gray was one of the few men that King John trusted throughout his life.

==Early life==

Although some describe de Gray as a native of Norfolk, he was likely descended from the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] knight, [[Anchetil de Greye]].<ref name=DNB>Haines "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11541 Gray, John de (d. 1214)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> De Gray was the uncle of Walter de Gray, later [[Archbishop of York]].<ref name=BHOCleve/> The elder de Gray was instrumental in securing the selection of his nephew as Lord Chancellor,<ref name=DNB/> as the elder de Gray was a surety for the younger de Gray's payment of a fine of 5,000 [[mark (money)|marks]] in order to secure the chancellorship.<ref name=Harding236>Harding ''England in the Thirteenth Century'' p. 236</ref>

De Gray entered [[John I of England|Prince John]]'s service by 1196, and was keeper of John's seal by 1198.<ref name=BHOCleve>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=7207 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons of Cleveland]''</ref> After John's accession in 1199 he became [[Archdeaconry of Cleveland|Archdeacon of Cleveland]] in March 1200<ref name=BHOCleve/> and [[List of Archdeacons of Gloucester|Archdeacon of Gloucester]] before April 1200.<ref name=BHOGlou>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33885 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Worcester: Archdeacons of Gloucester]''</ref> He also served as John's secretary,<ref name=Warren160>Warren ''King John'' pp. 160<U+2013>162</ref> as well as frequently serving as a deputy of the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Hubert Walter]].<ref name=Young149>Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 149</ref> Shortly after John's accession to the throne, de Gray traveled from the continent to England for a while, and for the first two years of John's reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.<ref name=DNB/>

De Gray was elected Bishop of Norwich about 7 September,<ref name=Handbook261/> although the election was purely ''pro forma'',<ref name=Warren160>Warren ''King John'' p. 160</ref> as acknowledged by a contemporary writer, [[Roger of Howden]], who stated that the new bishop "succeeded to the bishopric of Norwich by the gift of King John".<ref name=QWarren160>Quoted in Warren ''King John'' p. 160</ref> De Gray was [[consecration|consecrated]] on 24 September.<ref name=Handbook261>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 261</ref> The consecration took place along with that of the new [[Bishop of Hereford]], [[Giles de Braose]], and took place at [[Westminster]] at the conclusion of a provincial church council held by Archbishop Walter, which de Gray attended.<ref name=Walter65>Cheney ''Hubert Walter'' p. 65</ref> It was Walter who performed the consecration ceremony, held in a chapel of the monastery.<ref name=DNB/>

==Bishop of Norwich==

While bishop, de Gray often loaned the king money, and on one occasion held the [[regalia|royal regalia]] as security for the repayment of a loan. Besides financial efforts, the bishop also served as a royal justice. In 1203 de Gray went with Archbishop [[Hubert Walter]] of Canterbury on a diplomatic mission to King [[Philip II of France]].<ref name=DNB/> This embassy came to nothing, even though they were accompanied by [[papal legate]]s. Philip demanded that John's niece [[Eleanor of Brittany]] or his nephew [[Arthur of Brittany]] be surrendered to the King of France as well the ceding of all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. After the failure of their mission, the bishops returned to England and Philip invaded Normandy.<ref name=Loss260>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 260</ref> 

In 1203, some of de Gray's knights were part of the garrison at the castle of [[Le Vaudreuil|Vaudreuil]] in [[Normandy]] serving under the command of [[Robert FitzWalter]].  Although they had provisions and King John was moving in support of the troops, in the summer of 1203, the garrison surrendered to King Philip II of France shortly after a siege had begun.<ref name=Loss162>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 162</ref> When the king abandoned Normandy in late 1203, effectively giving up control of the duchy to Philip, de Gray was one of the companions on the journey to the port of Barfleur as well as going on to England with the king.<ref name=Loss169>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 169 and footnote 251</ref>

==Archbishop-elect==

King John's attempt to force de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 started the king's long quarrel with Pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be. King John postponed a decision while delegations from both the bishops of England and the monks of the [[cathedral chapter]] went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope.<ref name=Jones35/> The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say who who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior.<ref name=Harding266>Harding ''England in the Thirteenth Century'' p. 266</ref> According to [[canon law]], it was the monks of the cathedral chapter who had the right to elect the new archbishop. Balanced against these claims, the king also had a say in the election,<ref name=Lyon306>Lyon ''Constitution and Legal History'' pp. 306<U+2013>307</ref> as the archbishop was a major [[tenant-in-chief]] and was traditionally one of the main royal advisors.<ref name=Huscroft195>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 195<U+2013>196</ref> 

While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury decided to hold a secret election and elected one of the monks, [[Reginald (sub-prior)|Reginald]], to be archbishop. Reginald was sent to Rome to join the delegation. When King John found out that the monks had elected someone without any regal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop.<ref name=Warren160/> Some stories have the election of Reginald taking place before the sending of the first delegation to the [[Roman Curia|papal curia]]. Another source, [[Gervase of Canterbury]], has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure the election of de Gray.<ref name=Jones35>Jones ''King John and Magna Carta'' pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref> A further story, coming from [[Roger of Wendover]], stated that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a small portion of the cathedral chapter <U+2013> the younger ones <U+2013> participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and he was not a monk of Canterbury, so it is unlikely he is recording a true account.<ref name=Election212>Knowles "Canterbury Election" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 212<U+2013>215</ref>
 
De Gray was postulated to Canterbury on 11 December 1205,<ref name=Warren160/> which meant that Innocent was faced with two different candidates for the office. The pope, however, decided to try to compromise,<ref name=Lyon240>Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 240</ref> and both Reginald and de Gray's nominations were quashed by the pope about 30 March 1206.<ref name=Warren160/><ref name=Handbook232>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 232</ref> Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's election was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy.<ref name=Evil116>Turner ''King John'' p. 116</ref> The monks then elected, with Innocent's approval, [[Stephen Langton]].<ref name=Warren160/> Although both the monks and the pope accepted Langton,<ref name=Huscroft195/> John did not approve of Langton as archbishop, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight year struggle between John and Innocent over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop.<ref name=Lyon240/> John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks.<ref name=Huscroft195/> Innocent placed an [[interdict]] on England in 1207 and John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced the papal interdict. Innocent then [[excommunicate]]d John in 1209, but John was not concerned until 1213. The struggle led to the exile of many of the English clergy and the king also imposed large financial demands on the church in England.<ref name=Lyon240/> By 1209, only de Gray and [[Peter des Roches]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], were the only English bishops not in exile or dead.<ref name=Lyon306/>

==In Ireland==

By 1209, de Gray was in Ireland serving as governor there for the king.<ref name=Handbook161>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 161</ref> One possible reason for his appointment to Ireland was to keep him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without angering the papacy.<ref name=Warren195>Warren ''King John'' pp. 195<U+2013>196</ref> His policy while there was to extend English rule, and was involved with battles on the [[River Shannon]] and in [[Fermanagh]].<ref name=Otway83>Otway-Ruthven ''History of Medieval Ireland'' p. 83</ref> Another policy was to replace the Irish coinage with English coins. He also attempted to make English laws run in Ireland, but was unsuccessful.<ref name=Barlow408>Barlow ''Feudal Kingdom of England'' pp. 408<U+2013>409</ref> De Gray's governance of Ireland took place during a time of change in Irish governmental practices.<ref name=Angevin55>Gillingham ''Angevin Empire'' p. 55</ref>

When the king was persecuting [[William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber|William de Braose]] in 1209, Braose was given shelter by [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshall]] on Marshall's Irish lands. When de Gray demanded that Marshall surrender Braose to Gray on charges of being a traitor, Marshall refused, and told de Gray that since Marshall held some lands from Braose, it would be an act of treason for Marshall to surrender his lord to an outside authority.<ref name=Loss295>Powicke ''Loss of Normandy'' p. 295</ref> This sheltering of Braose did not embitter de Gray towards Marshall, who, in 1212, was praised in a letter from the bishop to the king.<ref name=Warren201>Warren ''King John'' p. 201</ref> 

In 1210, John led an expedition to Ireland to try to bring the Anglo-Norman barons under control. As part of this, John negotiated with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to the king. However, the historian Se<U+00E1>n Duffy has argued that this was not the case, and that the native Irish nobility were just as resistant to the king as the Anglo-Norman barons. When John returned to England, he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in [[Connacht]]. Connected with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government <U+2013> one from Meath and Leinster and the other from Munster.<ref name=Duffy241>Duffy "John and Ireland" pp. 241<U+2013>242</ref>

De Gray also faced resistance from the northern Irish, and in 1212 he lead a campaign against [[<U+00C1>ed M<U+00E9>ith]]. Connected with this campaign, de Gray constructed castles at [[C<U+00E1>er Uisce]], [[Belleek, County Fermanagh|Belleek]], and at [[Clones]]. These castles served as bases for raids against the [[Ua N<U+00E9>ill]] territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched, but nothing came of these efforts.<ref name=Duffy241/> De Gray suffered a defeat at the hands of [[Cormac mac Art <U+00D3> Melaghlain|Cormac O'Melaghlin]] in 1212 at [[Fircal]], Offaly.<ref name=DNB/> De Gray left Ireland and his office there in 1213.<ref name=Evil108>Turner ''King John'' p. 108</ref>

==Episcopal affairs and later career==

As bishop, de Gray settled a long running dispute between the monks of his cathedral chapter and the bishops.<ref name=Harper-Bill294>Harper-Bill "John and the Church" ''King John'' p. 294</ref> He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral.<ref name=Cheney121>Cheney ''From Becket to Langton'' p. 121 footnote 7</ref> De Gray was the addressee of a 1203 missive from Pope Innocent III decrying the continuing practice of some secular clergy being married, in contravention of canon law.<ref name=Cheney137>Cheney ''From Becket to Langton'' p. 137</ref> In more secular matters, he granted the town of [[King's Lynn#Toponymy|Bishop's Lynn]] (now [[King's Lynn]]) the right to hold a weekly market as well as two [[Fair#History|fair]]s per year. He also built a palace at [[Gaywood, Norfolk|Gaywood]].<ref name=DNB/>

De Gray's ability to raise money made him useful to King John. In 1213, de Gray mustered 500 knights during a period when King Philip II was threatening to invade England,<ref name=Powell121/> bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England.<ref name=Warren204>Warren ''King John'' p. 204</ref> In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, and part of the settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal.<ref name=Lyon306/> The settlement was sealed with a treaty, and de Gray was one of the witnesses to the document.<ref name=Powell121>Powell and Wallis ''House of Lords in the Middle Ages'' p. 121</ref> After John settled with the papacy, de Gray was not included in the general pardon, and had to go to Rome to receive a pardon.<ref name=Warren212/> While in Rome, the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement dealing with feudal payments for England between the king and the pope that lowered the lump sum that must be paid prior to the lifting of the interdict by Innocent.<ref name=Vincent92>Vincent ''Peter des Roches'' p. 92</ref>  After obtaining a pardon, Innocent recommended de Gray's election as [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1213;<ref name=Warren212>Warren ''King John'' p. 212</ref><ref name=BHODurham>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33859 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 2: Monastic cathedrals (northern and southern provinces): Durham: Bishops]''</ref> but de Gray died while returning to England at [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang<U+00E9>ly]] in [[Poitou]] on 18 October 1214.<ref name=Handbook261/> He was buried in [[Norwich Cathedral]], but the tomb does not survive.<ref name=DNB/>

Besides encouraging his nephew's career, de Gray also took into his household two of the household clerks of Hubert Walter <U+2013> David and Robert of Ruddeby.<ref name=Young58>Young ''Hubert Walter'' p. 58</ref> Another clerk employed by de Gray was [[Robert de Bingham]], who was in the bishop's household during the papal interdict on England and later went on to be a theology teacher at Oxford and [[Bishop of Salisbury]] in 1228.<ref name=Vincent83>Vincent ''Peter des Roches'' p. 83 and footnote 203</ref>

Besides de Gray's ability to raise large sums of money for John,<ref name=Powell121/> de Gray remained close to John for the rest of the bishop's life.<ref name=Evil46>Turner ''King John'' p. 46</ref> [[Sidney Painter]], a historian and biographer of John, said of de Gray that he was "probably the only man whom John trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association".<ref name=QEvil46>Quoted in Turner ''King John'' p. 46</ref> Ralph Turner, another medievalist and biographer of John, called de Gray "one of John's greatest favourites".<ref name=Evil61>Turner ''King John'' p. 61</ref> A third biographer of John, [[W. L. Warren]], described de Gray as "one of the best brains of the royal administration".<ref name=Warren195/> [[Matthew Paris]], a medieval writer, called him an "evil counsellor";<ref name=QDNB>Quoted in Haines "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11541 Gray, John de (d. 1214)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Paris also blamed much of the difficulties of John's later reign on de Gray's failed election to Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/>
