In 2009, a series of videos were released in which workers at several offices of the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) appeared to advise a young couple on how to hide prostitution activities and avoid taxes, resulting in news media and political uproar.  The videos, which were recorded secretly by conservative activists [[Hannah Giles]] and [[James O'Keefe]] (the "young couple"), were released on [[Fox News]] and the website [[BigGovernment.com]] from September into November 2009. They quickly generated widespread, negative publicity for ACORN, a non-profit organization involved in voter registration, community organizing and advocacy for low- and moderate-income people for nearly 40 years. O'Keefe explained in September 2009 that he "targeted ACORN for the same reasons that the political right does: its massive voter registration drives".<ref name="WAPost"/> The U.S. [[Census Bureau]] and the [[IRS]] ended contracts with the organization, and the U.S. Congress voted to suspend its funding to ACORN. Soon ACORN also lost most of its private funding, despite several independent investigations that by December 2009 began to reveal no criminal activity by ACORN staff had taken place. ACORN filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] liquidation on November 2, 2010, effectively closing the organization.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-acorn-bankruptcy-20101103,0,549666.story ACORN filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy]; ''Los Angeles Times''; November 2, 2010</ref>

Independent investigations were made by state attorney generals of Massachusetts and California, and the U.S. Attorney of Brooklyn, New York; their reports were released beginning in December 2009 and extending through April 2010. The attorney general's office in Massachusetts and the U.S. Attorney for Brooklyn concluded that the ACORN workers had committed no criminal activity and that the videos were "heavily edited" to present material out of context and create a misleading impression of activities.<ref>[http://www.proskauer.com/files/uploads/report2.pdf An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN], December 7, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/12/acorn_workers_cleared_of_illeg.html "ACORN Workers Cleared Of Illegality By Outside Probe"]</ref><ref>[http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/wendy_kaminer/2009/12/acorn_and_the_ethics_of_leadership.php "ACORN and the Ethics of Leadership"], ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', December 8, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1654:npq-on-acorn-investigation-results&catid=58:npq-in-the-news&Itemid=54 ACORN Investigation Results], ''The Nonprofit Quarterly''</ref><ref name="nymag1">[http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/03/damaging_brooklyn_acorn_sting.html "Damaging Brooklyn ACORN Sting Video Ruled 'Heavily Edited' - No Charges to Be Filed",] ''[[New York Magazine]]''; March 2, 2010</ref><ref name="NYT2010Newman">{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Andrew|title=Advice to Fake Pimp Was No Crime, Prosecutor Says|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2010-03-01|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/nyregion/02acorn.html|accessdate=2010-03-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100325060338/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/nyregion/02acorn.html| archivedate= 25 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="Salon2010Madden">{{cite web|last=Madde|first=Mike|title=Brooklyn prosecutors clear local ACORN office|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=2010-03-01|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/03/01/acorn_cleared/|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>

==Hannah Giles and James O'Keefe==
'''Hannah Giles''' (born March 15, 1989) is an American conservative activist. She came to national attention with James O'Keefe in the United States in September 2009 as a featured player in videos which they had filmed secretly in encounters at offices of the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN). At the time, Giles was studying journalism at [[Florida International University]]. Following the videos' release and extensive media coverage, she dropped out of college to "pursue demands to keep up with public appearances and job offers".<ref>[http://www.politico.com/click/stories/0911/citizen_journalists_path_to_celebrity_paved_with_ups_downs_.html [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] "Citizen Journalists' Path to Celebrity Paved With Ups, Downs" by Erika Lovely, 11-30-2009; retrieved 12-02-2009]</ref> Giles and O'Keefe spent $1,300 to accomplish what ''Washington Post'' reporters called a "Mission to Fell ACORN".<ref name="WAPost">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/17/AR2009091704805_2.html?sid=ST2011020203536 Darryl Fears and Carol D.

In the videos, O'Keefe included segments in which he wore a fur coat, top hat, sunglasses, and wielded a cane, giving viewers, including the media, the impression that he had dressed that way when he visited the ACORN offices and spoke to its workers.<ref name="TheLens"/> As part of the deception and distortion of the released videos, O'Keefe added that portion as a lead-in, but he was dressed professionally during his ACORN visits. He never revealed himself on camera in the visits to the ACORN offices.<ref name="TheLens"/>

In the '''Washington, D.C.''', office, Giles and O'Keefe ask about how to account for Giles' anticipated prostitution income on tax forms. Giles asks, "is there a way I can make up two years of tax returns?" The ACORN employee replies, "no you can't make it up", but tells Giles that she could form a business and state that she provides a service.<ref>Washington DC ACORN Transcript, p. 7</ref> The employee says, "you can have a business.

===October 2009===
On October 21, O'Keefe and Giles released video footage of their visit to the Philadelphia office of ACORN at a [[National Press Club]] conference. They claimed it was to show they had received help there, after an ACORN spokesman had said that the pair had been asked to leave the Philadelphia office.<ref name="PressClub">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/21/AR2009102103284_pf.html Susan Kinzie, "Duo release another video of their meeting with ACORN worker; latest footage has audio of two conservatives but not of the staff member"], ''The Washington Post,'' 22 October 2009</ref> ''The Washington Post'' "obtained a July 24 police report that showed police were called when O'Keefe and Giles attempted their sting at ACORN's Philadelphia offices<U+2014>and that the couple were escorted out of those offices."

==Aftermath for ACORN==
On March 19, 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ACORN was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy; 15 of the group's 30 state chapters had disbanded over the past six months, and other chapters (including the largest, in New York and California) had renamed themselves and severed all ties to the national organization.<ref name=bankruptcy>{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Urbina|date=March 19, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html|title=Acorn on Brink of Bankruptcy, Officials Say|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2010-03-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100323024816/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/us/politics/20acorn.html| archivedate= 23 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Two unnamed ACORN officials told the ''Times'' that the following weekend, a teleconference was planned to discuss a bankruptcy filing; "private donations from foundations to Acorn [had] all but evaporated." The federal government had ended contracts with the group related to organizing counts in urban areas for the Census and work for the IRS.<ref name=bankruptcy/> "[L]ong before the activist videos delivered what may become the final blow, the organization was dogged for years by financial problems and accusations of fraud."<ref name=bankruptcy/> "That 20-minute video ruined 40 years of good work", said Sonja Merchant-Jones, former co-chairwoman of ACORN's recently closed Maryland chapter. "But if the organization had confronted its own internal problems, it might not have been taken down so easily."<ref name=bankruptcy/>

===Report by the Congressional Research Service===
On December 22, 2009, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) released a report on ACORN activities, commissioned by the House Judiciary Committee. It stated that ACORN has not been found to violate any federal regulations in the past five years. In addition, findings included: There were no instances of voter fraud by individuals who were allegedly registered to vote improperly by ACORN or its employees; No instances where ACORN violated terms of federal funding in the last 5 years. The CRS found that O'Keefe and Giles may have violated Maryland and California laws banning the recording of face-to-face conversations without consent of both parties.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30919.html CRS report: ACORN didn't break law] ''Politico''; December 23, 2009</ref><ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/news/091222.html Conyers Releases CRS Report on ACORN], House Judiciary Committee; December 22, 2009</ref>

===Investigation by California attorney general===
On September 25, 2009, in response to Governor Schwarzenegger's request to investigate the incidents, the [[California Attorney General]]'s office opened an investigation "into the controversy surrounding videos that purportedly show members of community organizing group ACORN giving advice on how to open a brothel".<ref>[http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2009/10/ag-opens-probe.html AG opens probe into ACORN video flap]; ''Sacramento Bee''; October 1, 2009</ref>

On April 1, 2010, Attorney General [[Jerry Brown]] announced the office's findings, based on its review of new unedited videotapes recorded in the California offices of ACORN, as well as other evidence.<ref name="CA AG Release" /> The AG had granted O'Keefe and Giles immunity from prosecution in exchange for the raw videotapes. The report noted that the terms of the exchange did not exempt O'Keefe or Giles from being sued separately by the ACORN members filmed in the videos.<ref name="CA AG Report" /> Citing the 1967 Invasion of Privacy Act, Attorney General Office's report stated that "an application of these principles to the facts presented here strongly suggests that O'Keefe and Giles violated state privacy laws and provides fair warning to them and others that this type of activity can be prosecuted in California."<ref name="CA AG Report" />

The Attorney General Office criticized O'Keefe for not acting as a journalist trying to objectively report a story from the facts, noting instead that O'Keefe stated he "was out to make a point and to damage ACORN".<ref name="CA AG Report" /> The report said, "The video releases were heavily edited to feature only the worst or most inappropriate statements of the various ACORN employees and to omit some of the most salient statements by O'Keefe and Giles. Each of the ACORN employees recorded in California was a low level employee whose job was to help the needy individuals who walked in the door seeking assistance. Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos."<ref name="CA AG Report" />

For instance, one much-publicized recording had shown O'Keefe and Giles at the San Diego office. They show a worker purportedly seeking information from a contact in Mexico to help them smuggle underage girls from Mexico into the United States to work as prostitutes. The video did not show that the worker's 'contact' in Mexico was a police official. The employee collected as much specific information from Giles and O'Keefe as possible during their visit. The worker then contacted Mexican police to warn them of the plot.<ref name="Maddow">{{cite news|last=Maddow|first=Rachel|coauthors=|title=Raw ACORN tapes tell a very different story|work=MSNBC.com|date=2010-04-06|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36204129#36204129|accessdate=2010-04-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100410094636/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/36204129| archivedate= 10 April 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The AG Office's report stated, "ACORN was not the criminal enterprise described by O'Keefe in his 'Chaos for Glory' statement <U+2013> it did not receive billions in federal funds and did not control elections. ACORN is, however, disorganized and its operations were far from transparent, leaving it vulnerable to allegations of illegal activity and misuse of funds."<ref name="CA AG Report" /> The report also noted that despite O'Keefe's appearing in the released videos in "stereotypical 1970s pimp garb", in his actual taped sessions with ACORN workers, he was dressed in a shirt and tie, presented himself as a law student, and said he planned to use the prostitution proceeds to run for Congress, and never claimed he was a pimp.<ref name="CA AG Report" />

The report of the Attorney General Office concluded, "Even if O'Keefe and Giles had truly intended to break the law, there is no evidence that any of the ACORN employees had the intent to aid and abet such criminal conduct or agreed to join in that illegal conduct." While faulting a few of the recorded ACORN members for "terrible judgment and highly inappropriate behavior",<ref name="CA AG Report" />  The investigation report also concluded that "ACORN could determine that the conduct of its employees in California was inappropriate, but that is an employment matter, which does not rise to the level of a law enforcement or governmental concern", and determined that the employees did not commit prosecutable crimes in California. Regarding this contrast between the publicity related to the videos and what actually transpired, Attorney General Brown stated, "The evidence illustrates that things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality. Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor."<ref name="CA AG Release" />

===Investigation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office===
On June 14, 2010, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its findings on ACORN, by then disbanded.

The journalist Mark Bowden of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' said about the case in an interview September 18, 2009, with Alexandra Fenwick of the ''Columbia Journalism Review,'' "The young woman and filmmaker who visited those ACORN offices were political activists, and they put together what is, in essence, a very effective political protest against an organization they would like to damage. And they've done a very effective job of doing that. But I think they're clearly not journalists."<ref name="Fenwick">[http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/acorns_family_tree.php?page=1 Alexandra Fenwick, "ACORN's Family Tree: Was the Baltimore video journalism? Does it matter?"], ''Columbia Journalism Review'', 18 September 2009, accessed 29 July 2011</ref>

The next spring, on March 20, 2010, [[Clark Hoyt]], the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' [[ombudsman|public editor]], wrote an op-ed column conceding some errors in the paper's reporting. ACORN and its supporters had complained "that ''The Times'' got the story wrong and, by failing to correct it, has played into the hands of a campaign that has pushed the group near extinction." Hoyt acknowledged that it was by then known that it was not likely that O'Keefe went into the ACORN offices dressed as a pimp, as at the beginning and end of most of the videos. O'Keefe had presented himself "as a clean-cut young man, sometimes a college student, trying to rescue his girlfriend and under-age girls from an abusive pimp".<ref name="Hoyt">{{cite news|title=The Acorn Sting Revisited|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21pubed.html|date=2010-03-20|work=The New York Times|first=Clark|last=Hoyt}}</ref> But, Hoyt wrote, "ACORN's supporters appear to hope that the whole story will fall apart over the issue of what O'Keefe wore: if that was wrong, everything else must be wrong. The record does not support them. If O'Keefe did not dress as a pimp, he clearly presented himself as one: a fellow trying to set up a woman <U+2014> sometimes along with under-age girls <U+2014> in a house where they would work as prostitutes."<ref name="Hoyt" />

His article appeared before the release on April 1, 2010, of the California AG Report, which found that O'Keefe's videos had all been heavily edited to misrepresent the ACORN workers and present them in the worst possible light. The pair had set up the workers rather than doing investigative journalism.<ref name="CA AG Release" /> Investigations by the California AG, Brooklyn U.S. Attorney and the U.S. GAO found that ACORN workers had not participated in criminal activities.

==Criticisms of the undercover videos==
In September 2009, before the investigations revealed the selective and heavy editing of the videos, Alexandra Fenwick of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' described the video ensemble as a politically motivated piece that lacked context and did not present accurate information. She characterized the work as raw information instead of journalism. She said some elements of the ACORN videos seemed "shadows of journalism's muckraking past" and were commendable.<ref name="CJR1">{{cite web|last=Fenwick|first=Alexandra|title=ACORN's Family Tree: Was the Baltimore video journalism?|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date=2009-09-18|url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/acorns_family_tree.php?page=1|accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref> The videos were criticized by MSNBC's [[Norah O'Donnell]], who suggested the use of hidden cameras was a form of entrapment.

''[[Washington Post]]'' staff writers [[Darryl Fears]] and [[Carol Leonnig]] wrote that "Giles and O'Keefe have been criticized for accuracy problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants." The number assumed ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds.<ref name="FearsLeonnig">{{cite news|last=Fears|first=Darryl|title=The $1,300 Mission to Fell ACORN: Duo in Sting Video Say Their Effort Was Independent|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2009-09-18|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/17/AR2009091704805.html?hpid=topnews&sid=ST2009091704852|accessdate=2009-09-18}}</ref> Leonnig also observed that "the videos, in some cases, left out what I would call some [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] material ... for example, in one, a San Berna[r]dino employee at ACORN explains that there is no way ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style."<ref name="Leonnig1">{{cite news|last=Leonnig|first=Carol|title=Latest Developments in ACORN Story|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2009-09-23|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/23/DI2009092302081.html|accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref>

During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced "... [O'Keefe] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." He asked, "[I]s that what you think a pimp looks like?" O'Keefe answered yes. By six weeks later, the political journalist Mike Stark noted that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, where he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress.<ref name="HuffPOStark">{{cite web|last=Stark|first=Mike|title=All You Need to Know About the ACORN Scandal and Who Is Behind It|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2009-10-22|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-stark/all-you-need-to-know-abou_b_330643.html|accessdate=2009-10-22| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091026170941/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-stark/all-you-need-to-know-abou_b_330643.html| archivedate= 26 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Stark said, "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?"<ref name="HuffPOStark"/> 

The Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes cleared ACORN employees in the local office of criminal wrongdoing on March 1, 2010, after a five-month investigation. A law enforcement source said, "They edited the tape to meet their agenda", the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' quoted.<ref name="ABAJournal">{{cite web|last=McDonough|first=Molly|title=NY Prosecutor Clears ACORN Workers in Pimp and Hooker Incident|work=[[ABA Journal]]|date=2010-03-02|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/ny_prosecutor_clears_acorn_workers_in_pimp_and_hooker_incident/?from=widget|accessdate=2010-03-02}}</ref> The ACORN lawyer Arthur Schwartz commented that ACORN was "gratified that the DA has concluded something we knew all along". He said that O'Keefe and Giles had "used subterfuge to convince Congress and the media to vilify an organization that didn't deserve it".<ref name="ABAJournal"/>
