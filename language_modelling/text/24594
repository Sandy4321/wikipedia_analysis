'''''Myotis alcathoe''''' is a European bat in the genus ''[[Myotis]]''. First described in 2001 from Greece and Hungary, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Turkey, among other countries. It is similar to the [[whiskered bat]] (''Myotis mystacinus'') and other species and difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its [[karyotype]] and [[DNA sequence]]s.

''Myotis alcathoe'' is a small bat, usually reddish brown above and brown below. The [[tragus (anatomy)|tragus]] (a projection on the inner side of the ear) is short, as is the ear itself. The wings are brown. ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' has a very high-frequency [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call, which terminates at a frequency of about 43 kHz. It usually lives in old-growth deciduous forest near water. It forages high in the canopy and above water and mostly eats flies.
==Taxonomy==
The [[whiskered bat]] (''Myotis mystacinus'') and similar species in Eurasia are difficult to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related [[Brandt's bat]] (''Myotis brandtii'') was not recognized as distinct from ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' until the 1970s.<ref name=Nea362>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 362</ref> Small, unusual ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, but it was not until the advent of genetic methods that it could be confirmed that these bats represent a distinct species, named ''Myotis alcathoe''.<ref name=Dea230/> In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists O. von Helversen and K.-G. Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary.<ref name=Hea217>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 217</ref> Although it also differs from other species in the group by [[morphology (anatomy)|morphological]] characters, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including [[DNA sequence]]s and the location of the [[nucleolus organizer region]]s.<ref name=Hea218>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218</ref> Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' could apply to ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', because these names all have their [[type locality (biology)|type localities]] in western or central Europe.<ref name=Hea218/> However, the more recent discovery of ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered.<ref>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 648; Benda et al., 2003a, p. 364</ref>

According to [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequence analysis, ''Myotis alcathoe'' was thought to be most closely related to [[Geoffroy's bat]] (''Myotis emarginatus'') of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, fig. 2; Mayer et al., 2007, fig. 1</ref> However, a study of the mitochondrial [[cytochrome b|cytochrome ''b'']] gene incorporating many ''Myotis'' species did not support this relationship, and could not place ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' securely at a specific position among Eurasian ''Myotis''.<ref>Stadelmann et al., 2004, pp. 187<U+2013>188</ref> Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (separated by 1.3 to 1.4%) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different [[glacial refugium|glacial refugia]] where ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' populations survived the [[last glacial period]]. One, known as the "Hungarian" haplotype, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a refugium in Iberia; the other, the "Greek" haplotype, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.<ref name=Sea7>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 7</ref>

The [[specific name]], ''alcathoe'', refers to [[Alcathoe]], a figure from [[Greek mythology]] who was turned into a bat when she refused the advances of the god [[Dionysus]]. The bat lives in a similar habitat. She was associated with gorges and small streams, the preferred habitat of ''Myotis alcathoe'' in Greece.<ref name=Hea217/> In their original description, Dietz and von Helversen described her as a [[nymph]],<ref name=Hea217/> and the [[common name]] "nymph bat" has therefore been used for this species.<ref>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71; Benda, 2008, p. 107</ref> However, none of the classical sources speak of Alcathoe as a nymph; instead, she was a princess, the daughter of King [[Minyas (mythology)|Minyas]] of [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]]. Therefore, Petr Benda recommended in 2008 that the common name "Alcathoe bat" or "Alcathoe myotis" be used instead.<ref>Benda, 2008, p. 107</ref> Other common names include "Alcathoe's bat"<ref>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71</ref> and "Alcathoe whiskered bat".<ref name=iucn/>
==Description==
''Myotis alcathoe'' is the smallest European ''Myotis''. The fur is brownish, with a reddish tone in old specimens, above and a slightly paler gray-brown below.<ref name=Dea230/> Younger animals may be completely gray-brown.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218; Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref> The brown fur distinguishes adult ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from other members of the ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' group, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology.<ref name=Sea9>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 9</ref> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' is similar to [[Daubenton's bat]] (''Myotis daubentonii'') and ''M.&nbsp;emarginatus'' in color.<ref name=Bea362>Benda et al., 2003a, p. 362</ref> On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8&nbsp;mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.<ref name=Hea218/>

The face and the upper lips are reddish to pink.<ref name=DH42/> Although most of the face is hairy, the area around the eyes is bare.<ref name=Rea647/> The nostrils are heart-shaped.<ref name=DH42>Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42</ref> Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the in- than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of the ear, and the pointed [[tragus (anatomy)|tragus]] (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch.<ref name=Hea218/> The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref>Alcalde, 2010, p. 232; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54; Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647</ref> The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from the slightly larger ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'',<ref name=Hea218/> but the feet are relatively larger than in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=Rea647>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647</ref>

The wings are brown. The [[plagiopatagium]] (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is attached to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1&nbsp;mm beyond the back margin of the [[uropatagium]] (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The [[calcar]], a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3&nbsp;mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip. The [[baculum]] (penis bone) is about 0.5&nbsp;mm long and has the sides well developed. The shape of this bone distinguishes ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' from ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' as well as ''[[Myotis ikonnikovi|M.&nbsp;ikonnikovi]]''.<ref name=Hea218/>

The skull is similar in shape to that of ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'', but the front part of the [[braincase]] is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4).<ref name=Hea218/> The canine is less well-developed than in ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''.<ref name=Sea9/> There is a clear cusp present on the side of the P4. The accessory cusp known as the [[protoconule]] is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars.<ref name=Hea218/>

As usual in ''Myotis'' species, ''Myotis alcathoe'' has a [[karyotype]] consisting of 44 [[chromosome]]s, with the [[fundamental number]] of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' (then called "''Myotis'' sp. B") differs from both ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' in the pattern of active nucleolus organizer regions on the chromosomes.<ref name=Hea218/> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' also differs from other ''Myotis'' species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes [[12S rRNA]] and [[NADH dehydrogenase]] subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 219<U+2013>220</ref>

''Myotis alcathoe'' has the highest-frequency [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] call of any European ''Myotis''. In open terrain, the call has an average duration of 2.5&nbsp;ms, but it may be up to 4&nbsp;ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120&nbsp;kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53 kHz.<ref>von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> It terminates at around 43 to 46 kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive.<ref name=Dea231>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 231</ref>

Forearm length is 30.8 to 34.6&nbsp;mm (1.2 to 1.4&nbsp;in), tibia length is 13.5 to 15.9&nbsp;mm (0.5 to 0.6&nbsp;in), hindfoot length is 5.1 to 5.8&nbsp;mm (0.2 to 0.2&nbsp;in), and body mass is 3.5 to 5.5&nbsp;g (0.1 to 0.2&nbsp;oz).<ref name=Dea230>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 230</ref>
==Distribution and habitat==
Although ''Myotis alcathoe'' was initially known only from Greece and Hungary and was thought to be restricted to southeastern European, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Jan et al., 2010; Ahl<U+00E9>n, 2010</ref> Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in [[alluvial forest]]. In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the [[greater horseshoe bat|greater]] and [[lesser horseshoe bat]]s (''Rhinolophus ferrumequinum'' and ''R. hipposideros'') and ''Myotis emarginatus''.<ref name=Nea365>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365</ref> It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the [[Benelux]] countries, Ireland, Moldova, and Romania, and east to the [[Caucasus]].<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Dietz et al., 2007, pp. 231, 233; Jan et al., 2010, p. 471</ref> Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.<ref name=Sea11>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 11</ref>

Known records are as follows:
;Albania: A single specimen was caught in 2006 in a forest of planes (''[[Platanus orientalis]]'') and poplars (''[[Populus]]'' spp.) next to a small stream. ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' was recorded at the same place.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 362<U+2013>363</ref>
;Austria: Three specimens of ''Myotis alcathoe'' were caught in [[Burgenland]], southeastern Austria, in 2006.<ref>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 3</ref> They were caught near fishponds in a region dominated by oak (''[[Quercus petraea]]'') and hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'').<ref>Spitzenberger et al., 2008, pp. 4<U+2013>6</ref>
;Bulgaria: The species is known from six localities in the south and west<!--text of Niermann et al. (2007) says southern and eastern, but map on same page clearly shows that the sites are in the south and west--> of the country; the first record dates from 2003. Habitats include river and mountain forests.<ref name=Nea363>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 363</ref>
;Croatia: Here, the species was recorded in 2003 on the basis of two specimens.<ref name=Nea365/>
;Czech Republic: Here, the species was recorded at nine sites clustered in three regions, with the first record dating from 2001,<ref name=Lea64>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 64</ref> in addition to records from roadkilled specimens at three further sites.<ref><U+0158>eh<U+00E1>k et al., 2008</ref> The typical habitat was mature oak-hornbeam forest near water with dead, decaying trees,<ref name=Lea69/> at altitudes ranging from 170 to 390&nbsp;m (558 to 1280&nbsp;ft).<ref>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, table 1; <U+0158>eh<U+00E1>k et al., 2008, pp. 465<U+2013>466</ref> Both ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' occur in some of the same places in this country.<ref name=Lea69>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 69</ref> ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' has a limited, patchy distribution within the country, but reaches a high abundance in suitable habitat.<ref name=Lea68/>
;France: ''Myotis alcathoe'' was informally recognized in France in 2000 as a small ''Myotis'' similar to ''Myotis mystacinus'', the "Murin cantalou"; in 2002, it was realized that this bat represents ''Myotis alcathoe''.<ref>Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 645</ref> A large number of sites is known, mostly in the north of the country. The species reaches altitudes of up to 2000&nbsp;m (6562&nbsp;ft). It is usually found close to water, but it has been found in a variety of habitats, including farmlands, swamps, forests, and wooden grounds. It is caught at caves in late summer and autumn.<ref name=Nea363/>
;Germany: The species is known from two different areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western [[Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg]]. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the [[Kyffh<U+00E4>user]] hill range of [[Thuringia]] in central Germany. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest.<ref name=Nea364>Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364</ref> ''Myotis alcathoe'' has also been recorded in the nearby states of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]], where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water.<ref>Ohlendorf, 2009, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>
;Greece: The species has been recorded in the [[Pindus Mountains|Pindus]] and [[Rhodopi Mountains]] of central and northern Greece. Here, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is usually found in stands of [[Platanus|plane]] or [[alder]] trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the [[lesser horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus hipposideros'') and with ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus''<!--= aurascens?-->.<ref name=Hea221>von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 221</ref>
;Hungary: ''Myotis alcathoe'' is not uncommon in the mountain forests of northeastern Hungary. It has been found at brooks and lakes in oak, beech, alder, and [[hornbeam]] (''Carpinetum'') forests at 230 to 670&nbsp;m (755 to 2198&nbsp;ft) altitude. Both ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' occur together with ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' there.<ref name=Nea364/>
;Italy: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded in beech forest in [[Majella National Park]] in the region of [[Abruzzo]].<ref>Parco Nazionale della Majella, 2008</ref> Additional specimens of ''Myotis alcathoe'' have been identified in Italy using molecular methods.<ref>Galimberti et al., 2010</ref>
;Latvia: A small ''Myotis'' was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe''.<ref>Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Latvia, 2010</ref>
;Poland: The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, at 770 to 1294&nbsp;m (2526 to 4245&nbsp;ft) altitude. Most caves were surrounded by beech forest (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), and one was surrounded by fir (''[[Abies alba]]'') and dwarf pine (''[[Pinus mugo]]'').<ref name=Nea364/>
;Romania: A single ''Myotis alcathoe'' was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains fluvial and conifer forest.<ref>Csaba and Annam<U+00E1>ria, 2007, p. 179</ref>
;Slovakia: Here, ''Myotis alcathoe'' is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at 525&nbsp;m (1722&nbsp;ft) altitude.<ref>Benda et al., 2003a, pp. 360<U+2013>361</ref>
;Spain: In [[Catalonia]], the species is known from six sites,<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, table 1</ref> ranging from sea level to 1200&nbsp;m (3900&nbsp;ft) altitude. It is known in beech and riverine forest and was first recorded in 2006.<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 41</ref> The species is known from three sites in [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], where it was recorded in 2004, and occurs amidst beech and riverine forest at 790 to 1390&nbsp;m (2590 to 4560&nbsp;ft) altitude.<ref>Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54</ref> It has also been found at seven localities in [[Navarre]], with the first record dating from 2004. There, it occurs in beech and oak forest at altitudes from 140 to 980&nbsp;m (460 to 3220&nbsp;ft).<ref>Alcalde, 2010, pp. 227<U+2013>229</ref> A single locality is known in [[Galicia]].<ref>Arz<U+00FA>a et al., undated</ref>
;Sweden: The species was recorded at five sites in the south of the country, starting in 2008, on the basis of echolocation calls.<ref>Ahl<U+00E9>n, 2010</ref>
;Switzerland: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded from the [[Jura Mountains]] in the canton of [[Vaud]].<ref>Stadelmann et al., 2004, table 1, p. 187</ref>
;Turkey: Eight individuals have been caught at three sites in close vicinity in the European part of the country<ref name=Nea364/> in 2006.<ref>Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 371<U+2013>372</ref>
;United Kingdom: ''Myotis alcathoe'' has been recorded in England since 2003, and is known from two swarming sites in the south and a third site in the north of the country.<ref name=Jea471>Jan et al., 2010, p. 471</ref> The northern England site, in [[Ryedale]], is in a protected area with many old trees, and the southern sites (in [[Sussex]]) are in woodland.<ref name=Jea476>Jan et al., 2010, p. 476</ref>
The species is also known from Montenegro and possibly from Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=iucn/> Early records of ''Myotis ikonnikovi''<U+2014>now known to be an eastern Asian species<U+2014>from Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species.<ref name=Hea221/> Because ''Myotis mystacinus''-like bats cannot easily be distinguished from each other without the use of genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of ''Myotis alcathoe'' and/or ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' and/or (in some cases) ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'' have been reported from Bulgaria,<ref>Benda et al., 2003b, pp. 288<U+2013>290</ref> Belgium,<ref>Kervyn et al., 2009</ref> Ukraine,<ref>Zagorodniuk and Dyvyy, 2009</ref> and Montenegro.<ref>Benda, 2004, p. 14</ref>
==Ecology and behavior==
According to a study in the Czech Republic, the diet of ''Myotis alcathoe'' mostly consists of [[Nematocera]] flies, but [[caddisflies]], [[spider]]s, small [[lepidoptera]]ns, and [[neuroptera]]ns are also taken.<ref name=Lea66>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 66</ref> The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water.<ref name=Lea68>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 68</ref> The parasitic mite ''[[Spinturnix mystacina]]'' has been found on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', and the mites on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'', ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'', and ''M.&nbsp;mystacinus'' are genetically closely related.<ref>Bruyndonckx et al., 2009, table 1, fig. 2</ref> The [[bat fly]] ''[[Basilia mongolensis nudior]]'' has been recorded on ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' in Thuringia.<ref>Heddergott, 2009</ref>

''Myotis alcathoe'' lives in small groups.<ref name=O46>Ohlendorf, 2009, p. 46</ref> In Greece, a maternity colony, containing three females and two juveniles, has been found in a plane tree.<ref name=Hea221/> Another roost was found high in an oak tree in Baden-W<U+00FC>rttemberg.<ref name=O46/> Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in ''[[Quercus robur]]'' oaks; others were in limes (''[[Tilia cordata]]''), birches (''[[Betula pendula]]''), and various other species.<ref name=Lea65>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 65</ref> Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy. In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups.<ref name=Lea67>Lu<U+010D>an et al., 2009, p. 67</ref> In August, the animals start to aggregate in caves, where they likely spend the winter.<ref name=Dea233>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 233</ref> Reproduction probably also takes place in these caves. Pregnant females have been found as late as June.<ref name=Dea234>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 234</ref> One individual of ''M.&nbsp;alcathoe'' was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as ''M.&nbsp;brandtii'') and again in 2009.<ref name=Jea473>Jan et al., 2010, p. 473</ref>

==Conservation status==
Because ''Myotis alcathoe'' remains poorly known, it is assessed as "[[Data Deficient]]" on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=iucn/> However, it may be endangered because of its narrow ecological preferences.<ref name=Dea234/> Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites where it has been recorded have already been destroyed.<ref name=Hea221/> Forest loss is another possible threat,<ref name=iucn/> and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats.<ref name=Dea233/> Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats.<ref name=Dea234/> The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal.<ref name=iucn/> In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.<ref name=Dea235>Dietz et al., 2007, p. 235</ref> In Catalonia, the species is listed as "Endangered" in view of its apparent rarity there.<ref>Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 42</ref>
