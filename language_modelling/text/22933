'''''Icewind Dale II''''' is a [[computer role-playing game]] developed by [[Black Isle Studios]] and published by [[Interplay Entertainment]], released on August 27, 2002. It is set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' [[fantasy]] setting in the [[Sword Coast#Icewind Dale|Icewind Dale]] region, and is the sequel to ''[[Icewind Dale]]''. The player assumes control of a group of mercenaries in a war between the [[Sword Coast#Ten Towns|Ten Towns]] of Icewind Dale and an army of persecuted races and religious factions.

The game is designed as an action-oriented alternative to other [[Infinity Engine]] games, with less emphasis on exploration and story. It uses a [[Time-keeping systems in games#real time|real-time]] adaptation of the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition |Third Edition]] ruleset. The Infinity Engine was extensively modified to comply with the Third Edition, and forced the removal of certain rules. It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine.

The game received positive critical reception, and was praised for its combat, pacing, and use of the Third Edition rules. However, certain reviewers felt the graphics and engine had become outdated, and could not compete with its contemporaries.

==Gameplay==
''Icewind Dale II'' is a [[Time-keeping systems in games#real time|real-time]] adaptation of the ''D&D'' Third Edition ruleset. The gameplay is viewed from an [[isometric projection|isometric]]-perspective, while the [[heads-up display]] (HUD) occupies the bottom of the screen. Accessible from the HUD are an [[automap]] and journal; the journal automatically records quests and important events. The player uses a [[point and click]] [[user interface|interface]] to interact with the game; for example, clicking on the ground moves the selected [[player character]], and clicking on a passive [[non-player character]] (NPC) will initiate dialogue. When conversations occur, the HUD expands to display the text, and the player is presented with multiple dialogue options. The game is separated into area maps, obscured by fog of war; fog recedes as an area is explored. A multiplayer component is available for online play with up to six players.<ref name=manual>{{cite book | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | title=Icewind Dale II Instruction Manual | author=Avellone, Chris; Greene, Michael | date=2002 }}</ref>

===Story===

The game begins as the player's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos.<ref name=mercenaries>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Narrator:''' Only a few small ships made it through to Targos, where my Uncle was watching from the upper reaches of the town. Many villagers were too busy repelling enemies at the palisade wall to notice a few sad, sorry stragglers make it into the port. The sun burned behind the horde and cast a cloak of shadows over the heart of Targos and all within. It was into this shadow that uncommon mercenaries were thrust from Captain Hedron's ship, the Wicked Wench. Like many other mercenaries in the town, these few had come from Luskan.  Unlike the others, their journeys would take them far beyond the rude palisades and bloody fields that lay ahead of them...}}</ref> They report to the town palisade and fend off an assault by the goblin army.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' Lord Ulbrec has officially welcomed us into the Targos Guard, and he has told us to report to the commander of the Targos Guard, Shawford Crale, for our assignments. 
Ulbrec told us we could find Crale at the Palisade, just beyond the north gate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' We told Shawford that we'd pressured the Iron Collar band to get their worthless hides onto the Palisade, and he seemed surprised and grateful at our efforts.  No sooner had he finished congratulating us when we heard an explosion from outside, and the Palisade was under attack![..]With aid from the Targos Guard, we managed to turn back the goblin attack on Targos and slaughter the goblin leaders.  We should tell Shawford or Ulbrec of our success.}}</ref> After this, the mayor of Targos orders them to start an offensive on the goblin army.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' Lord Ulbrec praised us for our efforts in defending Targos during the goblin attack on the Palisade, but with his praise came another mission: a goblin force has taken the Shaengarne Bridge to the south, a bridge that the Neverwinter reinforcements intended to use to reach Targos.  He wants us to travel to Shaengarne Bridge and retake it from the goblinoids. He hopes our band can succeed where the Targos Guard cannot; only time will prove him right or wrong. / [...] Lord Ulbrec heard of the destruction of Shaengarne Bridge, and he has determined that only if Targos can mount an offensive quickly can Targos hope to break the goblin horde before they strike the town again. He has asked us to meet two of his scouts, Ennelia and Braston, south and east of Targos and give them whatever aid they require to break the goblins' strength in the region.}}</ref> The group kills the chieftain of the army, and discovers that he was under the command of a woman named Sherincal.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' We have met the ranger Braston in the bowels of the Horde Fortress.

However, he was quick to point out that even if this Sherincal was directing Guthma, our removal of Guthma should be enough to stop the attacks on Targos. / [...] After defeating Guthma, Ennelia has reported that the horde army is already starting to fall apart. She congratulated us on our victory and noted that our attack has crippled any further offenses against the Ten-Towns.}}</ref> When they return to Targos, the mayor asks them to rendezvous with reinforcements from [[Neverwinter]].<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' Lord Ulbrec heard of our success in infiltrating the horde fortress and defeating the bugbear chieftain, Guthma.  He thanked us for our efforts and gave us our next mission, which should prove somewhat less strenuous than the other suicide missions we've already taken.

A storm causes the ship to crash, and the group awakens to discover that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' Traveling in Oswald's airship to the Western Pass to find and meet with the military expedition from Neverwinter, we noticed a glacier blocking a large section of the pass.

We should investigate that very unusual glacier.}}</ref> While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple.

As the group travels to Kuldahar, they meet a [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|drow]] named Nym, who tells them that the pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an alternate path through the Underdark exists.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' We met a drow mechant named Nym in a small village.

mountains. There should be a network of caves there that leads to a monastery high in the mountains.  Beneath the monastery is an entrance to the Underdark.  From there we'll enter the ancient
dwarven ruins of Dorn's Deep from below.  From there we can surface on the northern side of the Spine of the World.}}</ref> Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym.

attack Kuldahar, and Isair warned us to stop our "meddling," claiming that Targos wasn't alone in having Luskan allies.  To demonstrate his seriousness, Isair slew several villagers and raised them as zombies against us before vanishing along with his sister.}}</ref> The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark.<ref>{{cite video game | title=Icewind Dale II | developer=[[Black Isle Studios]] | publisher=[[Interplay Entertainment]] | date=2002 | quote='''Journal:''' The drow merchant Nym told us that the Eastern Pass was entirely blocked by troops of the Legion of the Chimera.

''Icewind Dale II'' was not originally planned to be a complete conversion to the ''D&D'' Third Edition ruleset; only certain rules were implemented, and the kit system introduced in [[Baldur's Gate 2]] was used. <ref name=developer4>{{cite web | url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/357/357328p1.html | title=Icewind Dale II Designer Diary #3 | author=Maldonado, Dave | date=March 15, 2002 | work=[[RPG Vault]] | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}</ref><ref name=rpgdotinterview /><ref name=rpgvaultinterview /> J.E. Sawyer and several other members of the team pushed for the game's conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted a time extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules.<ref name=rpgdotinterview /> The [[Infinity Engine]] required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due to interface and engine issues.<ref name=igninterview /><ref name=rpgdotinterview /><ref name=gamezoneinterview>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/09_19_02_01_16PM.htm/ | title=Journey into the world of Icewind Dale II with Josh Sawyer | author=Lafferty, Michael | date=September 19, 2002 | work=[[Gamezone]] | accessdate=August 23, 2009}}</ref> ''Icewind Dale II'' was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.<ref name=gamespotreview>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/icewinddale2/index.html | title=Icewind Dale II Review for PC | date=September 06, 2002 | work=[[Gamespot]] | author=Kasavin, Greg | accessdate=September 02, 2009}}</ref>

The game went gold on August 05, 2002, and was released on August 27.<ref name=pressreleases /> After the release of ''Icewind Dale II'', J.E.

===Audio===

The music of the game was composed by Inon Zur, whose previous works included ''[[Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal]]'' and ''[[Fallout Tactics]]''.<ref name=rpgplanetinterview>{{cite web | url=http://www.rpgplanet.com/features/interviews/inonzur/ | title=Inon Zur Interview  | author=Ladewig, Bruce | date=October 11, 2002 | work=[[RPGPlanet]] | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref> Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain the tone of the music.<ref name=gamespotinterview /> Inon Zur worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dale[...]we made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game<U+2019>s soundtrack." Zur described the composing process, "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers\music supervisor I<U+2019>ll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration." and that, "each piece should have it<U+2019>s own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I have to make sure that the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps..." He called the composing experience, "very pleasant and rewarding."<ref name=rpgplanetinterview />

The music was composed in five weeks, and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks.<ref name=rpgfaninterview>{{cite web | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/inon-zur-interview.html | title=Inon Zur Interview | author=McCarroll, John | date=December 02, 2002 | work=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref> As the game's music budget was low, a small Los Angeles orchestra was used to record the music, and the sound of the instruments doubled during production.<ref name=gamedaily>{{cite web | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030626222950/http://gamedaily.com/features_new/inon_zur/index.asp |url=http://gamedaily.com/features_new/inon_zur/index.asp | archivedate=June 26, 2003 | title=Inon Zur: Videogame Music Composer | work=[[Game Daily]] | accessdate=August 27, 2009}}</ref> Inon Zur described the music, "...[the music of] Icewind Dale II has some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [with] the [inclusion] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra and it created some ambiance that is quite unique." Inon Zur later said, "I thought that we definitely met some high standards; we compared our products to big budget films scores", and, "in the end we were quite happy."<ref name=rpgfaninterview /> The game features voice work from [[Gabrielle Carteris]], [[Peter Stormare]] and [[Grey Delisle]], among others.<ref name=manual />

Many reviewers praised the game's combat and pacing.

The game was criticized for its graphics and engine, with reviewers considering them outdated. G4 called the engine "old" and "clunky",<ref name=g4review /> and ''PC Format'' said that "the whole thing is limited by the creaking engine."<ref name=pcformatreview /> However, certain sources praised the engine. ''Game Informer'' called it, "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented,"<ref name=gameinformerreview /> and Gamespot said, "'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." In regards to the graphics, Gamespot said, "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [but] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated."<ref name=gamespotreview /> IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that, "the animations are crude by today's standards."<ref name=ignreview /> However, ''Computer Gaming World'' said, "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game,"<ref name=cgwreview /> and ''Computer Games Magazine'' said, "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts."<ref name=cgmreview>{{cite journal | last=Bub | first=Andrew | title=Once more unto the Dale dear friends! | page=80 | date=November 2002 | work=[[Computer Games Magazine]]}}</ref> The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise.

''Game Informer'' called the writing and story, "on par with any fantasy novel."<ref name=gameinformerreview /> ''PC Gamer'' said it had, "some of the richest and most enjoyable dialogue since Planescape Torment," and an, "impressive storyline."<ref name=pcgamerusreview /> Gamespot called the story "engrossing," and said, "the game is very well written, offering up a number of strong characters and serious themes."<ref name=gamespotreview /> ''PC Zone'' said, "thanks to the excellent NPCs, the battles have a lot more meaning, as there is a strong storyline behind the endless hacking and slashing."<ref name=pczonereview /> ''PC Format'' thought that, "IDII also suffers, like its predecessor, from a story irrevocably weakened by anonymous central characters <U+2013> the six you create."<ref name=pcformatreview /> In regards to the audio, Gamespot said, "Inon Zur does a truly fantastic job that's perhaps even better than Soule's effort in the original Icewind Dale," and that, "the voice acting in Icewind Dale II is as great as you've perhaps come to expect from a Black Isle Studios role-playing game."<ref name=gamespotreview /> ''Computer Gaming World'' said, "[the] sound effects, music, and voiceovers are all excellent."<ref name=cgwreview />
