'''Gender''', in common usage, refers to the differences between [[man|men]] and [[woman|women]]. ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'' notes that [[gender identity]] is "an individual's self-conception as being male or female, as distinguished from actual biological sex."<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036351 Gender Identity], Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online, 2007.</ref> Although ''gender'' is commonly used interchangeably with ''[[sex]]'', within the [[social sciences]] it often refers to specifically [[Sociology|social]] differences, known as ''[[gender role]]s'' in the [[Biology|biological]] sciences. Historically, [[feminism]] has posited gender roles to be [[social construction|socially constructed]], independent of any biological basis. People whose gender identity feels incongruent with their physical bodies may call themselves ''[[transgender]]'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''.

Many languages have a system of [[grammatical gender]], a type of [[noun class]] system <U+2014> nouns may be classified as ''masculine'' or ''feminine'' (for example [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]]) and may also have a ''neuter'' grammatical gender (for example [[Sanskrit]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and the Scandinavian languages). In such languages, this is essentially a [[Convention (norm)|convention]], which may have little or no connection to the meaning of the words. Likewise, a wide variety of phenomena have characteristics termed ''gender'', by analogy with [[male]] and [[female]] bodies (such as the [[gender of connectors and fasteners]]) or due to [[Norm (sociology)|societal norms]].

==Etymology and usage==
===The word ''gender'' in English===
=====Gender = kind=====
The word ''gender'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''gendre'', a [[loanword]] from [[Norman conquest of England|Norman-conquest]]-era [[Old French]]. This, in turn, came from [[Latin]] ''[[:la:genus]]''. Both words mean 'kind', 'type', or 'sort'. They derive ultimately from a widely attested [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''g<sup>e</sup>n-'',<ref>
[[Julius Pokorny]], [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&morpho=0&basename=\data\ie\pokorny&first=651 'gen'], in ''Indogermanisches etymologisches W<U+00F6>rterbuch'', (Bern: Francke, 1959, reprinted in 1989), pp. 373-75.</ref><ref>

It appears in Modern [[French language|French]] in the word ''[[genre]]'' (type, kind, also ''[[:fr:genre sexuel]]'') and is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''gen-'' (to produce), appearing in ''[[gene]]'', ''[[genesis]]'' and ''[[oxygen]]''.
<!-- Checked with OED 2nd ed. -->
As a verb, it means ''breed'' in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James]] [[Bible]]:
*'''1616''': Thou shalt not let thy cattle '''gender''' with a diverse kind <U+2014> {{bibleref|Leviticus|19:19}}.

Most uses of the root ''gen'' in Indo-European languages refer either directly to what pertains to birth
or, by extension, to natural, innate qualities and their consequent social distinctions
(for example ''gentry'', ''generation'', ''gentile'', ''genocide'' and ''eugenics'').
The first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of ''gender'' as 'kind' had already become obsolete.

=====Gender = masculinity or femininity=====
The use of ''gender'' to refer to [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] as types is attested throughout the history of [[Modern English]] (from about the [[14th century]]).
*'''1387-8''': No mo '''genders''' been there but masculine, and femynyne, all the remnaunte been no genders but of grace, in facultie of grammar <U+2014> [[Thomas Usk]], ''The Testament of Love'' II iii ([[Walter William Skeat]]) 13.

=====Gender = noun class=====
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre2.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]]]]
According to [[Aristotle]], the Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]] used the terms ''masculine'', ''feminine'', and ''neuter''
to classify nouns, introducing the concept of grammatical gender.
:{{Polytonic|<U+03C4><U+1F70> <U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7> <U+03C4><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+1F40><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+1F04><U+03C1><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B1> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03B8><U+03AE><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B1> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03B7>}}
:The classes (''gen<U+0113>'') of the nouns are males, females and things.<ref>
"A fourth rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female and inanimate." [[Aristotle]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMCohto0YC&pg=PA127&dq=%22A+fourth+rule+is+to+observe+Protagoras%27+classification+of+nouns+into+male,+female+and%22&sig=Wg2rcesYtvK9vOmolAPnzKqjZaQ ''Rhetoric'',] translated by William Rhys Roberts (1858<U+2013>1929), (reprinted [[Dover Publications|Dover]], 2004), p. 297f. ISBN 9780486437934</ref>
::<U+2014> Aristotle, ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|The Technique of Rhetoric]]'' III v
The words for this concept are not related to ''g<sup>e</sup>n-'' in all Indo-European languages (for example, ''rod'' in [[Slavic languages]]).

The usage of ''gender'' in the context of grammatical distinctions is a specific and technical usage.
However, in English, the word became attested more widely in the context of grammar, than in making sexual distinctions.

This was noted in OED1, prompting [[Henry Watson Fowler]] to recommend
this usage as the primary and preferable meaning of ''gender'' in English.
"Gender ... is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons ... of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder."<ref>
[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], 1926: p. 211.</ref>

The sense of this can be felt by analogy with a modern expression like "persons of the female persuasion." It should be noted, however, that this was a recommendation, neither the ''Daily News'' nor Henry James citations (above) are "jocular" nor "blunders." Additionally, patterns of usage of ''gender'' have substantially changed since Fowler's day (''noun class'' above, and ''sexual stereotype'' below).

=====Gender = sexual stereotype=====
The word ''sex'' is sometimes used in the context of social roles of men and women <U+2014>
for example, the British ''[[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]]'' that ended exclusion of women from various official positions.
Over the course of the [[1970]]s, the feminist movement took the word ''gender'' into their own usage
to describe their theory of human nature.
Early in that decade, ''gender'' was used in ways consistent with
both the history of English and the history of attestation of the root.
<!-- citation in Feminist section of this article -->
However, by the end of the decade consensus was achieved in both theory and terminology.
The theory was that human nature is essentially [[epicene]] and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed.
Matters pertaining to this theoretical process of social construction were labelled matters of ''gender''.

The [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference.<ref name="difference"> [http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html Usage note: ''Gender'',] ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, (2000).</ref>
*'''2000''': The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex ''(not gender)'' of the patient.
*'''2000''': In peasant societies, gender ''(not sex)'' roles are likely to be more clearly defined.

outnumbering uses of ''sex'' in the social sciences.<ref name="haig">

Frequently, but not exclusively, this indicates acceptance of the feminist theory of human nature.
However, in many instances, the term ''gender'' still refers to sexual distinction generally without such an assumption.
*'''2004''': Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing '''gender''' rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation <U+2014> David Haig, ''The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex''.
In fact, the ideological distinction between ''sex'' and ''gender'' is only fitfully observed.<ref name="haig" />

===The concept of gender in other languages===
'''Greek''' (distinguishes biological from sociological in adjectives)

In Greek, male biology and masculine grammatical inflection are denoted by ''arsenikos'' ({{Polytonic|<U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}), in distinction to sociological masculinity, which is denoted by ''andrikos'' ({{Polytonic|<U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}). Likewise, female biology and feminine grammatical inflection are denoted by ''th<U+0113>lukos'' ([[:el:<U+0398><U+03B7><U+03BB><U+03C5><U+03BA><U+03CC>|{{Polytonic|<U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BB><U+03C5><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}]]); and sociological femininity is denoted by ''gunaikeios'' ([[:el:<U+0393><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03BA><U+03B1>|{{Polytonic|<U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}]], compare English [[gynaecology]]). This distinction is at least as old as Aristotle (see above). It is a different distinction to English, where 'male' and 'female' refer to animals as well as humans, but not to grammatical categories; however, 'masculine' and 'feminine' refer to grammatical categories as well as humans, but not properly to animals, except as [[anthropomorphism]].

'''German and Dutch''' (no distinction in nouns <U+2014> ''Geschlecht'' and ''geslacht'')

In English, both 'sex' and 'gender' can be used in contexts where they could not be substituted <U+2014> 'sexual intercourse', 'safe sex', 'sex worker', or on the other hand, 'grammatical gender'. Other languages, like German or Dutch, use the same word, ''[[:de:Geschlecht]]'' or ''[[:nl:geslacht]]'', to refer not only to biological sex, but social differences as well, making a distinction between biological 'sex' and 'gender' identity difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loanword ''Gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes ''Geschlechtsidentit<U+00E4>t'' is used for 'gender' (although it literally means 'gender identity') and ''Geschlecht'' for 'sex'.<ref>
See translation of Judith Butler's ''Gender Trouble''</ref>
More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for 'biological sex', ''Geschlechtsidentit<U+00E4>t'' for 'gender identity' and ''Geschlechtsrolle'' for 'gender role', and so on. Both German and Dutch use a separate word, ''[[:de:Genus]]'', for grammatical gender.

'''Swedish''' (clear distinction in nouns <U+2014> ''genus'' and ''k<U+00F6>n'')

In Swedish, 'gender' is translated with the linguistically cognate ''[[:sv:genus]]'', including sociological contexts, thus: ''Genusstudier'' (gender studies) and ''Genusvetenskap'' (gender science). 'Sex' in Swedish, however, only signifies sexual relations, and not the proposed English dichotomy, a concept for which ''[[:sv:k<U+00F6>n]]'' (also from [[Proto Indo-European|PIE]] ''g<sup>e</sup>n-'') is used. A common distinction is then made between ''k<U+00F6>n'' (sex) and ''genus'' (gender), where the former refers only to biological sex. However, Swedish uses the words ''[[:sv:k<U+00F6>nsroller|sv:k<U+00F6>nsroll]]'' and ''[[:sv:k<U+00F6>nsidentitet]]'', for the English terms 'gender role' and 'gender identity'.

===Summary===
The historical meaning of ''gender'' is something like "things we treat differently because of their inherent differences". It has three common applications in contemporary English. Most commonly it is applied to the general differences between men and women, without any assumptions regarding biology or sociology. Sometimes however, the usage is technical or assumes a particular theory of human nature, this is always clear from the context. Finally the same word, ''gender'', is also commonly applied to the independent concept of distinctive word categories in certain languages. Grammatical gender has little or nothing to do with differences between men and women.

Likewise, the word ''sex'' has two distinct meanings in English. It can be used to describe whether an individual of a sexually reproducing species is physically male or female. ''Sex'', ''male'' and ''female'' in this sense view humans as ''Homo sapiens'' and are impersonal, or dehumanizing, in many contexts.
*Person A: We just had our first baby!
*Reply 1: ''Boy or girl?'' (personal, suited to a friend)
*Reply 2: ''Male or female?'' (impersonal, suited to a doctor <U+2014> or vet <U+2014> unsuited to a friend)
The word ''sex'' is also used to refer to erotic behaviour between humans, rather more broadly than ''mating'' is used of animals. Reproduction is not assumed in reference to human sexual behaviour. Both uses of ''sex'' are clearly relevant to the study of differences between men and women.

==Biology of gender==
The [[biology of gender]] became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what is now called ''[[gender identity disorder]]'' (GID). Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by [[John Money]], a pioneer and controversial sex and gender researcher.
{{cquote|The term "gender role" appeared in print first in 1955. The term "gender identity" was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.<ref>[[John Money]], 'The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years', ''Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy'' '''20''' (1994): 163-77.</ref>}}
Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a ''continuum'' of [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] features (Money's word is "dipolar"), that link biological and behavioural differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to postnatal features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "postpubertal hormonal" effects.
[[Image:StevePinker.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Pinker]]]]
Prior to recent technology that made study of [[brain]] differences possible, observable differences in ''behaviour'' between men and women could not be adequately explained solely on the basis of the limited observable ''physical'' differences between them. Hence the, then plausible, theory that these differences might be explained by arbitrary cultural assignments of roles. However, Money notes concisely that masculine or feminine self-identity is now seen as essentially an expression of dimorphic brain structure (Money's word is "coding"). The new discoveries have an additional advantage over the theory of cultural arbitrariness of gender roles, as they help explain the ''similarities'' between these roles in widely divergent cultures (see [[Steven Pinker]] on [[Donald Brown]]'s ''[[Human Universals]]'', including [[romantic love]],<ref>

Although causation from the biological <U+2014> [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Sex steroids|hormonal]] <U+2014> to the behavioural has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behaviour in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, we have not conclusively identified a "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]", but nor have we excluded such a possibility.<ref>

The following systematic list ([[gender taxonomy]]) illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human [[life cycle]]. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly to accommodate the constantly growing knowledge base. One [[academic journal|journal]], published since 2002, is specifically devoted to [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=1601-1848&site=1 ''Genes, Brains and Behavior''].

==Sex== 
===Sexual reproduction===
[[Image:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating]]
[[Sexual reproduction]] is a popular system of producing new individuals within various species. Individuals of sexually reproducing species produce special kinds of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s called ''[[gamete]]s'', whose function is specifically to fuse with one ''unlike'' gamete and hence form a new individual. This fusion of two unlike gametes is called [[fertilization]]. By convention, where one type of gamete cell is physically larger than the other, it is associated with female sex. Thus an individual that produces exclusively large gametes ([[ovum|ova]] in humans) is said to be ''female'', and one that produces exclusively small gametes ([[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] in humans) is said to be ''male''. An individual that produces both types of gametes is called ''hermaphrodite'' (a name applicable also to people with one testis and one ovary). In some species hermaphrodites can self-fertilize, in others they can achieve fertilization with females, males or both. Some species, like the Japanese Ash, ''[[Fraxinus lanuginosa]]'', only have males and hermaphrodites, a rare reproductive system called ''[[androdioecy<U+200E>]]''.

What is considered defining of sexual reproduction is the ''difference'' between the gametes and the ''binary'' nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete ''types'' within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, of more than 1.5 million living species,<ref>[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 'RedList'], ''International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources'' official website.</ref>
recorded up to about the year 2000, "no third sex cell <U+2014> and so no third sex <U+2014> has appeared in multicellular animals."<ref>

However, the reason for the initial evolution of sex, and the reason it has survived to the present are still matters of debate, there are many plausible theories. It appears that the ability to reproduce sexually has evolved independently in various species on many occasions. There are cases where it has also been lost. The [[flatworm]], ''[[Dugesia tigrina]]'', and a few other species can reproduce either sexually or [[Asexual reproduction|asexually]] depending on various conditions.<ref>

===Sexual differentiation===
[[Image:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|Sexual differentiation in [[peafowl]]]]
Although sexual reproduction is ''defined'' at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate ''within'' the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called [[DNA]] that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called ''chromosomes''. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called ''sex'' chromosomes because of their role in [[Sex-determination systems|sex determination]]. Ova always have the same sex chromosome, labelled ''[[X chromosome|X]]''. About half of spermatozoa also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a [[Y chromosome]]. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed [[Gender#Gender taxonomy|above]].

In humans, the "[[Default (computer science)|default]]" processes of reproduction result in an individual with female characteristics. An intact Y chromosome contains what is needed to "reprogram" the processes sufficiently to produce male characteristics, leading to [[sexual differentiation]] (see also [[Sexual dimorphism]]). Part of the Y chromosome, the [[SRY|Sex-determining Region Y]] (SRY), causes what would normally become ovaries to become testes. These, in turn, produce male hormones called ''androgens''. However, several points in the processes have been identified where variations can result in people with atypical characteristics, including atypical sexual characteristics. Terminology for atypical sexual characteristics has not stabilized. ''[[Disorder of sexual development]]'' (DSD) is used by some in preference to ''[[Intersexuality|intersex]]'', which is used by others in preference to ''[[pseudohermaphroditism]]''.

[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) is an example of a DSD that also illustrates that female development is the default for humans. Although having one X and one Y chromosome, some people are biologically insensitive to the androgens produced by their testes. As a result they follow the normal human processes which result in a person of female sex. Women who are XY report identifying as a woman <U+2014> feeling and thinking like a woman <U+2014> and, where their biology is ''completely'' insensitive to [[masculinization|masculinizing]] factors, externally they look identical to other women. Unlike other women, however, they cannot produce ova, because they do not have ovaries.

The human [[XY sex-determination system|XY system]] is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system <U+2014> males are ZZ and females ZW. Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of [[butterfly]] are known to have female parent sex determination. The [[platypus]] has a complex hybrid system, the male has ten sex chromosomes, half X and half Y.

==Genes, Brains and Behaviour==
===Genes===
[[Image:Lightmatter chimp.jpg|thumb|[[Chimpanzee]]]]
Chromosomes were likened to books (above), also like books they have been studied at more detailed levels. They contain "sentences" called ''genes''. In fact, many of these sentences are common to multiple species. Sometimes they are organized in the same order, other times they have been "edited" <U+2014> deleted, copied, changed, moved, even relocated to another "book", as species evolve. Genes are a particularly important part of understanding biological processes because they are directly associated with observable objects, outside chromosomes, called ''[[protein]]s'', whose influence on cell [[chemistry]] can be measured. In some cases genes can also be directly associated with differences clear to the naked eye, like eye-colour itself. Some of these differences are sex specific, like hairy ears. The "hairy ear" gene is on the Y chromosome which is why only men have it. However, genes on ''any'' chromosome can "say", "''if'' you are in a male body do X, otherwise don't." The same principle explains why [[chimpanzee]]s and humans are distinct, despite sharing nearly all their genes.

The study of genetics is particularly inter-disciplinary. It is relevant to almost every biological science. It is investigated in detail by molecular level sciences, and itself contributes details to high level abstractions like evolutionary theory.

===Brain===
[[Image:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|Human [[brain]]]]
There are small statistical differences in size between brains of men and women.<ref>Michael A. McDaniel, [http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Big-Brained%20article.pdf 'Big-Brained People are Smarter: A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between In Vivo Brain Volume and Intelligence',] ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' '''33''' (2005): 337<U+2013>346.</ref> However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring", some of these differences are very pronounced. [[Richard J. Haier]] and colleagues at the universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[University of California, Irvine|California (Irvine)]] found, using [[brain mapping]], that men have more than six times the amount of [[grey matter]] related to general [[intelligence]] than women, and women have nearly ten times the amount of [[white matter]] related to intelligence than men.<ref>Richard J Haier, E Jung and others, [http://www.ucihs.uci.edu/pediatrics/faculty/neurology/haier/pdf/82.pdf 'Structural Brain Variation and General Intelligence',] ''[[NeuroImage]]'' '''23''' (2004): 425<U+2013>433.</ref>
Gray matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.<ref>
Carol A. Tamminga, [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/156/3/352 'Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism'], ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' '''156''' (1999): 352.</ref>
Most of these differences are known to be produced by the activity of hormones, hence ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences arising from the activity of genes directly have also been observed.
{{cquote|A sexual dimorphism in levels of [[Gene expression|expression]] in brain [[Biological tissue|tissue]] was observed by [[quantitative]] [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], with females presenting an up to 2-fold excess in the abundance of PCDH11X [[Gene transcription|transcripts]]. We relate these findings to sexually dimorphic [[Trait (biology)|traits]] in the human brain. Interestingly, PCDH11X/Y gene pair is unique to ''Homo sapiens'', since the [[Sex linkage|X-linked gene]] was [[Transposition (genetics)|transposed]] to the Y chromosome after the human<U+2013>chimpanzee [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]] split.<ref>Alexandra M. Lopes and others,'Inactivation status of PCDH11X: sexual dimorphisms in gene expression levels in brain', ''[[Human Genetics]]'' '''119''' (2006): 1<U+2013>9.</ref>}}
[[Image:Surfacegyri.jpg|thumb|[[Language]] areas of the brain]]
It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviours, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women.<ref>"Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result." Linda Marsha, [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/brain/she-thinks 'He Thinks, She Thinks',] ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' '''July''' (2007).</ref> For example, both men and women learn and use language; however, [[Biochemistry|bio-chemically]], they appear to process it differently. Differences in male and female use of language are likely reflections ''both'' of biological preferences and aptitudes, ''and'' of learned patterns.

Two of the main fields that study brain structure, biological (and other causes) and behavioural (and other results) are brain [[neurology]] and biological psychology. [[Cognitive science]] is another important discipline in the field of brain research.

===Behaviour===
Some behaviours are so simple that biological explanation may be sufficient. Blinking, yawning and stretching are more [[reflex]]es than behaviours. However, [[etiquette]] and [[protocol]] are complicated behaviours, presumably influenced by many environmental factors, including social (man-made) ones. A large area of research in [[behaviouralism|behavioural psychology]] collates evidence in an effort to discover [[correlation]]s between behaviour and various possible antecedents such as genetics, culture, gender, physical or social development, or physical or social environments.

A core research area within sociology is the way human behaviour operates on ''itself'', in other words, how the behaviour of one group or individual influences the behaviour of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.

==Social categories==
===Sociology===
[[Image:Mollcutpurse.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Frith]] ("Moll Cutpurse") scandalised 17th Century society by wearing male clothing, smoking in public, and otherwise defying gender roles.]]
Sexologist John Money [[Neologism|coined the term]] ''gender role'' in 1955. "The term ''gender role'' is used to signify all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to, sexuality in the sense of eroticism."<ref>
John Money, "Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings', ''Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital'' '''96''' (1955): 253<U+2013>264.</ref>
Elements of such a role include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations and other factors not limited to biological sex. Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, ''gender role'' is often abbreviated to ''gender'' in their literature, without leading to ambiguity in that context.

Most societies have only two distinct gender roles <U+2014> male and female <U+2014> and these correspond with biological sex. However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex, for example the [[Two-Spirit]] people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal male and female roles in those societies. In the language of the [[sociology of gender]] they comprise a [[third gender]],<ref>
Gilbert Herdt (ed.), ''Third Sex Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History'', 1996. ISBN 0-942299-82-5</ref>
more or less distinct from biological sex (sometimes the basis for the role does include intersexuality or incorporates [[eunuch]]s).<ref>Will Roscoe, ''Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2000. ISBN 0-312-22479-6</ref>

[[Joan Roughgarden]] argues that in some non-human animal species, there can also be said to be more than two genders, in that there might be multiple templates for behavior available to individual organisms with a given biological sex.<ref>Joan Roughgarden, ''Evolution's Rainbow: Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People'', [[University of California Press]], 2004. ISBN 0-520-24073-1</ref> 

Consideration of the dynamics of societies like those above prompted debate over the extent to which differences in male and female gender roles are learned socially, or reflect biology. Social constructionists argued that gender roles are entirely arbitrary, and biological preferences and aptitudes are irrelevant. Contrary to social constructionism [[Essentialism|essentialists]] argued that gender roles are entirely determined by biology, unmodified by social adaptations. Although these extreme views are common enough in the history of literature on the subject, both are now rare in the [[peer review]]ed literature (see [http://www.sexscience.org/publications/index.php?category_id=439&subcategory_id=338 contents] of ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'' issues, published by SSSS <U+2014> [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]]).

Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses ''masculinities'' and ''femininities'' in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.

===Feminism and Gender studies===
[[Image:Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|[[Simone de Beauvoir]]]]
The philosopher and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[existentialism]] to women's experience of life: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."<ref>Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Second Sex'', 1949, as translated and reprinted 1989."</ref> In context, this is a philosophical statement, however, it is true biologically <U+2014> a girl must pass puberty to become a woman <U+2014> and true sociologically <U+2014> mature relating in social contexts is learned, not instinctive.

Within [[feminist theory]], terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'',
the author uses "innate gender" and "learned sex roles",<ref>
Chafetz, JS. ''Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles''. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1974.</ref>
but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed.<ref>
Chafetz, JS. ''Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles''. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1978.</ref>
By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted [[trait theory|traits]].

In [[gender studies]] the term ''gender'' is used to refer to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, ''gender'' explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.<ref>Stephanie Garrett, ''Gender'', (1992), p. vii.</ref> This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jaques Lacan]]; and in the work of feminists such as [[Judith Butler]]. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "[[performative]]."<ref>Judith Butler, ''Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity'', (1999), p. 9.</ref>

Sociologists consider society to be constructed, and it follows that gender in our society is also constructed. We tend to easily equate sex and gender, and assume that knowing someone<U+2019>s biological sex implies their gender. Hurst states that some people think sex will <U+201C>automatically determine one<U+2019>s gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one<U+2019>s [[sexual orientation]] (sexual attractions and behavior). (Hurst, p. 141)<U+201D> <ref>[Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139-142]</ref> However, gender is not produced at birth, as sexual organs are, and we have [[cultural]] origins and habits for dealing with gender. Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriate in their designated gender in order to properly fill the role. The way we behave as [[masculine]], [[feminine]], or any combination reflects the highly detailed gender maps that we have laid out in our society. Given how ingrained and detailed these gender schemas are, it is hard to imagine that we create and reinforce them ourselves. However, Schwalbe comments that we <U+201C>are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas.(Schwalbe, p.23)<U+201D> <ref>[Schwalbe, M.  The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition. 2005. 22-23]</ref>

In order to maintain these detailed gender schemas, humans present and typically display their gender as either masculine or feminine. We do this through everything from [[clothing]] and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because we want to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. We need to place people into distinct categories in order to know how we should feel about them.

Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in [[discrimination]] based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system due to societal prejudices. Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that <U+201C>courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex. (Hurst, p.141)<U+201D> This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a man or woman is judged differently because they do not present as the <U+201C>correct<U+201D> gender. How we present and display our gender has consequences in everyday life, but also in [[institutionalized]] aspects of our society.

===Legal status===
A person's sex as male or female has legal significance <U+2014> sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples.

The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is male or female. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for [[intersexual]] or [[transgender]] people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate <U+2014> technically, however, this is not a change of status ''[[per se]]''. Rather, it is recognition of a status which was deemed to exist, but unknown, from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgender people.

[[Sex assignment|Gender assignment]], when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female gonads could be recognised as female at birth.

The ability to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|change legal gender]] for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognised as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.

It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law (a state recognises gender transitions, but the federal government does not).

=== Gender and development ===
Gender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[participation (decision making)|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

As well as directly addressing inequality, attention to gender issues is regarded as important to the success of development programs, for all participants.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} For example, in [[microfinance]] it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Also, it is claimed that women are more likely to use the money for the benefit of their families.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. A notable example is [[Wangari Maathai]]'s environmental organization, the [[Green Belt Movement]].

==Spirituality==
{{main|God and gender}}
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|thumb|[[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]]]
In [[Taoism]], [[yin and yang]] are considered feminine and masculine, respectively.

In the [[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) the [[Shekhinah]] represents the feminine aspect of God's essence.
<!-- There's something odd about presenting Jewish mysticism without presenting Judaism. There's little that's feminine about God in the Tanakh. Shekhinah is a feminine noun, but so are about 50% of Hebrew words. Shekhinah is a popular term in Christian language these days, especially in the Charismatic movement, and there's nothing feminine about it. -->
<!-- I had initially written "Judaism", but since I am not sure if this interpretation of the Shekhina as feminine is accepted by mainstream Jews I thought it was more prudent to present it as an idea of Jewish mysticism. In any case, the main articles develop the topic further. -->

In [[Christianity]], God is described in masculine terms; however, the Church has historically been described in feminine terms.  On the other hand, Christian [[theology]] in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both genders perfectly, and is the creator of both human genders.

In [[Hinduism]], {{cquote|"One of the several forms of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Shiva]], is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess [[Parvati]] (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva. 
While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).
Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita<U+2013>"not two") in Hindu thought says in his "Saundaryalahari"<U+2014>''Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api'' " i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term "Shiva" originated from "Shva," which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.

This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both male and female components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, multiple sex partners and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks."<ref name="vohra">"The Male-Female Hologram," Ashok Vohra, [[Times of India]], [[March 8]], [[2005]], Page 9</ref>}}

==Other uses==
The word ''gender'' is used in several contexts to describe binary differences, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.
===Linguistics===
Natural languages often make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds.
* [[Grammatical gender]] is a property of some languages in which every [[noun]] is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, a girl is [[denotation|denoted]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by ''[[:es:muchacha]]'' (grammatically feminine), in [[German language|German]] by ''[[:de:M<U+00E4>dchen]]'' (grammatically neuter) and in [[Irish language|Irish]] by ''[[:ga:cail<U+00ED>n]]'' (grammatically masculine).
* Several languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese]]. The oldest documented language, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. 
* Most languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of more [[Gender-neutral language in English]] and other languages.

===Connectors, pipe fittings, and fasteners===
[[Image:F plug.jpg|thumb|right|250px|European electrical power plug and socket.<br>Male plug on left, mating female socket on right.]]
<!-- merged from full article -->In [[electrical]] and [[Mechanics|mechanical]] trades and manufacturing, and in [[electronics]], each of a pair of mating [[Electrical connector|connectors]] or [[fastener]]s (such as [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]s and [[screw|bolt]]s) is conventionally assigned the designation ''male'' or ''female''. The assignment is by direct [[analogy]] with animal [[genitalia]]; the part bearing one or more protrusions, or which fits inside the other, being designated male and the part containing the corresponding indentations or fitting outside the other being female.

This kind of male-female distinction is known as ''gender'' (not ''sex'') of connectors and fastners. It provides an example of a technical use of the term ''gender'' that evokes association with the physiology, rather than sociology, of male-female differences.

The standard letters "M" and "F" are commonly used in part numbers. For example, in Switchcraft XLR [[microphone]] or [[hydrophone]] connectors, the part numbers are denoted as follows:
*A3F = Audio 3-pin Female connector;
*A3M = Audio 3-pin Male connector.
A cable that has A3F on both ends or A3M on both ends is sometimes referred to as a "gay cable" or "gay cord".

In plumbing fittings, the "M" or "F" usually comes at the beginning rather than the end.  For example:
*MIP denotes Male International Pipe thread;
*FIP denotes Female International Pipe thread.
A "gay" male pipe (i.e. a short length of pipe having an MIP at both ends) is sometimes called a "nipple".<ref>[http://www.plumbingsupply.com/chrome.html Chrome Fittings & Nipples]</ref>

===Music===
In western music theory, keys, chords and scales are often described as having ''major'' or ''minor'' tonality, sometimes related to ''masculine'' and ''feminine''. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} By analogy, the ''major'' scales are masculine (clear, open, extroverted), while the minor scales are given feminine qualities (dark, soft, introverted). German uses the word ''Tongeschlecht'' ("Tone gender") for tonality, and the words ''Dur'' (from Latin ''durus'', hard) for ''major'' and ''moll'' (from Latin ''mollis'', soft) for ''minor''. ''See'' [[Major and minor]].
