'''Ali ibn Abu'l-Hayja 'Abdallah ibn Hamdan ibn al-Harith Sayf al-Dawla al-Taghlibi''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0633><U+064A><U+0641> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062F><U+0648><U+0644><U+0629> <U+0623><U+0628><U+0648> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062D><U+0633><U+0646> <U+0627><U+0628><U+0646> <U+062D><U+0645><U+062F><U+0627><U+0646>}}), more commonly known simply by his ''[[laqab]]'' (honorific epithet) of '''Sayf al-Dawla''' ("Sword of the [Abbasid] Dynasty"), was the founder and ruler of the [[Emirate of Aleppo]], encompassing most of northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and parts of western [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], and the brother of al-Hasan ibn Abdallah ibn Hamdan (better known as [[Nasir al-Dawla]]).

The most prominent member of the [[Hamdanid dynasty]],<ref name="EI2-H126"/> Sayf al-Dawla originally served under his elder brother in the latter's attempts to establish his control over the weak [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] government in [[Baghdad]] during the early 940s CE. After the failure of these endeavours, the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla turned towards Syria, where he confronted the ambitions of the [[Ikhshidids]] of [[Egypt]] to control the province. After two wars with them, his authority over northern Syria, centred at [[Aleppo]], and the western Jazira, centred at [[Mayyafariqin]], was recognized by the Ikhshidids and the Caliph. A series of tribal rebellions plagued his realm until 955, but he was successful in overcoming them and maintaining the allegiance of the most important Arab tribes. Sayf al-Dawla's court at Aleppo became the centre of a vibrant cultural life, and the literary cycle he gathered around him, including the great [[al-Mutanabbi]], helped ensure his fame for posterity.

Sayf al-Dawla was widely celebrated for his role in the [[Arab<U+2013>Byzantine Wars]], facing a resurgent [[Byzantine Empire]] that in the early 10th century had begun to conquer Muslim territories. In this struggle against a much superior enemy, he launched raids deep into Byzantine territory and managed to score a few successes, and generally held the upper hand until 955. After that, the new Byzantine commander, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]], and his lieutenants spearheaded an offensive that broke Hamdanid power. The Byzantines annexed [[Cilicia]], and even occupied Aleppo itself briefly in 962. Sayf al-Dawla's final years were marked by military defeats, his own growing disability as a result of disease, and a decline in his authority that led to revolts by some of his closest lieutenants. He died in early 967, leaving a much weakened realm, which by 969 had lost Antioch and the Syrian littoral to the Byzantines and become a Byzantine tributary.

== Life ==
===Origin and family===
Sayf al-Dawla was born Ali ibn Abdallah, the second son of [[Abdallah ibn Hamdan|Abdallah Abu'l-Hayja ibn Hamdan]] (died 929), son of Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith, who gave his name to the [[Hamdanid dynasty]].<ref name="EI2-103"/><ref name="EI2-H126">Canard (1986), p. 126</ref> The Hamdanids were a branch of the [[Banu Taghlib]], an Arab tribe resident in the area of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper Mesopotamia) since pre-Islamic times.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 265<U+2013>266</ref> The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled [[Mosul]] and its region until the late 9th century, when the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in his effort to fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance of the [[Kurds]] living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.<ref name="EI2-H126"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 269</ref><ref name="EI2-104">Bianquis (1997), p. 104</ref> 

Hamdan was defeated in 895 and imprisoned with his relatives, but his son [[Husayn ibn Hamdan]] managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and the Arab and Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strained relationship with the central Abbasid government in [[Baghdad]] during the early 10th century.<ref name="EI2-H126"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266, 268</ref> Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the [[Kharijites]] and the [[Tulunids]], but was disgraced after supporting the failed usurpation of [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz|Ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim was governor of [[Diyar Rabi'a]] (the province around [[Nasibin]]) in 919 and after his death in the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud.<ref name="EI2-H126"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 266<U+2013>267</ref> Sayf al-Dawla's father Abdallah served as emir (governor) of [[Mosul]] in 905/6<U+2013>913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful [[Mu'nis al-Khadim]], he later played a leading role in the short-lived usurpation of [[Al-Qahir]] against [[Al-Muqtadir]] in 929, and was killed during its suppression.<ref>Canard (1986), pp. 126<U+2013>127</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 267<U+2013>268</ref> He was the most prominent member of the first generation of the Hamdanid dynasty, and was essentially the founder of the Hamdanid Emirate of Mosul.<ref name="EI2-H127">Canard (1986), p. 127</ref>

During his absence in Baghdad in his final years, Abdallah relegated authority over Mosul to his eldest son, al-Hasan, the future [[Nasir al-Dawla]]. After Abdallah's death, Hasan's position in Mosul was challenged by his uncles, and it was not until 935 that he was able to secure confirmation by Baghdad of his control over Mosul and the entire Jazira up to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier.<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), p. 268</ref>

===Early career under al-Hasan Nasir al-Dawla===
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), the homeland and main power base of the Hamdanids]]
The young Ali ibn Abdallah began his career in the service of his brother. In 936, Hasan invited his younger brother to his service, promising him the governorship of [[Diyar Bakr]] (the region around [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]]) in exchange for his help against Ali ibn Ja'far, the rebellious governor of [[Mayyafariqin]]. Ali ibn Abdallah was successful in preventing Ibn Ja'far from receiving the assistance of his [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Armenian]] allies, and also secured control over the northern parts of the neighbouring province of [[Diyar Mudar]] after subduing the [[Qays]]i tribes of the region around [[Saruj]].<ref name="EI2-104"/> From this position, he also launched expeditions to aid the Muslim emirates of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier zone (the ''[[Thughur]]'') against the advancing Byzantines, and intervened in Armenia to reverse growing Byzantine influence (see [[#Early campaigns|below]]).<ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 104, 107</ref>

In the meantime, Hasan became involved in the intrigues of the Abbasid court. Since the murder of Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]] in 932, the Abbasid government had all but collapsed, and in 936 the powerful governor of [[Wasit]], [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]], assumed the title of ''[[amir al-umara]]'' ("commander of commanders") and with it ''[[de facto]]'' control of the Abbasid government. The Caliph [[al-Radi]] was reduced to a figurehead role, while the extensive old civil bureaucracy was drastically reduced both in size and power.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 192<U+2013>195</ref> Ibn Ra'iq's position was anything but secure, however, and soon a convoluted struggle for control of the office, and the Caliphate, broke out among the various local rulers and the Turkish military chiefs, which ended in 946 with the victory of the [[Buyids]].<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 195<U+2013>196</ref> 

Hasan initially supported Ibn Ra'iq, but in 942 he had him assassinated and secured for himself the powerful position of ''[[amir al-umara]]'', receiving the honorific ''[[laqab]]'' of ''Nasir al-Dawla'' ("Defender of the Dynasty"). The [[Baridis]], who also desired control over the Caliph, continued to resist, and Nasir al-Dawla now sent Ali against them. After scoring a victory over [[Abu'l Husayn al-Baridi]] at [[al-Mada'in]], Ali was named governor of [[Wasit]] and awarded the ''laqab'' of Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the Dynasty"), by which he became famous. This double award marked the first time that a ''laqab'' incorporating the prestigious element ''Dawla'' were granted to anyone other than the ''[[vizier|wazir]]'', the Caliphate's chief minister.<ref name="EI2-104"/><ref name="Kennedy270">Kennedy (2004), p. 270</ref> 

The Hamdanids' success proved short-lived, however. They were politically isolated, and found little support among the Caliphate's most powerful vassals, the [[Samanids]] of [[Transoxiana]] and the [[Ikhshidids]] of [[Egypt]]. Consequently, when in 943 a mutiny broke out among their troops (mostly composed of Turks, [[Daylamites]], [[Carmathians]] and only a few Arabs) over pay issues, under the leadership of the Turk [[Tuzun]], they were forced to quit Baghdad.<ref name="EI2-104"/><ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref name="Kennedy270"/> Caliph [[al-Muttaqi]] soon quarrelled with Tuzun, now ''amir al-umara'', and fled north, to seek Hamdanid protection. Tuzun however defeated Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla in the field, and in 944 an agreement was concluded which allowed the Hamdanids to keep the Jazira and even gave them nominal authority over northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] (which at the time was not under Hamdanid control), in exchange for a large tribute. Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad. However, his continued attempts to control Baghdad led to a [[Battle of Baghdad (946)|clash]] with the Buyids. Eventually, in 958/9 Nasir al-Dawla would be forced to seek refuge in the court of his brother, before Sayf al-Dawla could negotiate his return to Mosul with [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]].<ref name="EI2-H127"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 270<U+2013>271</ref>

===Establishment of the Emirate of Aleppo===
Northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] had been under the control of the Ikhshidids since 935/6, until Ibn Ra'iq detached it from Egyptian control in 939/40. In 942, when Nasir al-Dawla replaced the assassinated Ibn Ra'iq, he attempted to impose his own control over the region, and particularly Ibn Ra'iq's own province of Diyar Mudar. Hamdanid troops took control of the [[Balikh River]] valley, but the local magnates were still inclined towards the Ikhshidids, and Hamdanid authority was tenuous. The Ikhshidids did not intervene directly, but supported 'Adl al-Bakjami, the governor of [[Rahba]].  Al-Bakjami captured Nasibin, where Sayf al-Dawla had left his treasures, but was finally defeated and captured by Sayf al-Dawla's cousin Abu Abdallah al-Husayn ibn Sa'id ibn Hamdan, and executed at Baghdad in May 943. Husayn then proceeded to occupy the entire province, from Diyar Mudar to the ''Thughur''. [[Al-Raqqah]] was taken by storm, but [[Aleppo]] surrendered without a fight in February 944.<ref name="EI2-104"/><ref name="EI2-H129">Canard (1986), p. 129</ref> Al-Muttaqi now sent feelers to [[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid|al-Ikhshid]], asking for his support. The Hamdanids confined the Caliph at Raqqah, but in in summer 944 al-Ikhshid arrived in Syria. Husayn abandoned Aleppo to the Egyptian, who then visited the exiled Caliph at Raqqah. Al-Muttaqi confirmed Ikhshidid control over Syria, but after the Caliph refused to relocate himself to Egypt, the Egyptian ruler refused to commit himself to further aid for the Caliph against his enemies. The Ikhshid returned to Egypt, while al-Muttaqi went back to Baghdad.<ref name="EI2-104"/><ref name="EI2-H129"/><ref name="Egypt113">Bianquis (1998), p. 113</ref>

It was in this context that Sayf al-Dawla turned his attention to Syria. The previous years had seen a series of personal humiliations, with defeats in the field by Tuzun followed by his failure to persuade al-Muttaqi to nominate him as ''amir al-umara''. It was during the latter attempt that he also had one of his rivals, Muhammad ibn Inal al-Turjuman, assassinated. As [[Thierry Bianquis]] writes, following the failure of his brother's designs in [[Iraq]], Sayf al-Dawla's turn to Syria was "born of resentment when, having returned to Nasibin, he found himself under-employed and badly paid".<ref name="EI2-104"/> Nasir al-Dawla seems to have encouraged his brother to turn to Syria after Husayn's failure there, writing to Sayf al-Dawla that "Syria lies before you, there is no one in this land who can prevent you from taking it".<ref name="EI2-105">Bianquis (1997), p. 105</ref> With money and troops provided by his brother, Sayf al-Dawla invaded northern Syria in the wake of the Ikhshid's departure. He gained the support of the local [[Banu Kilab]] tribe, to which the Ikhshid-appointed governor of Aleppo belonged, and entered the city unopposed in October 944.<ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="EI2-H129"/><ref name="Egypt113"/><ref name="Kennedy273">Kennedy (2004), p. 273</ref>  

====Conflict with the Ikhshidids====
[[File:Aleppo Citadel 04.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Entrance of the citadel of Aleppo, with the early 13th-century gatehouse]]
The Ikhshidids reacted, and sent an army north under [[Abu al-Misk Kafur]] to confront Sayf al-Dawla, who was besieging [[Homs]]. In the ensuing battle, the Hamdanid scored a crushing victory. Homs then opened its gates, and Sayf al-Dawla set his sights on [[Damascus]]. Sayf al-Dawla briefly occupied the city in early 945, but was forced to abandon it in the face of the citizens' hostility.<ref name="EI2-105"/> In April 945 the Ikhshid himself led an army into Syria, although at the same time he also offered terms to Sayf al-Dawla, proposing to accept Hamdanid control over northern Syria and the ''Thughur''. Sayf al-Dawla rejected the Ikhshid's proposals, but was defeated in battle in May/June and forced to retreat to Raqqah. The Egyptian army proceeded to raid the environs of Aleppo. Nevertheless, in October the two sides came to an agreement, broadly on the lines of the earlier Ikhshidid proposal: the Egyptian ruler acknowledged Hamdanid control over northern Syria, and even consented to sending an annual tribute in exchange for Sayf al-Dawla's renunciation of all claims on Damascus. The pact was sealed by Sayf al-Dawla's marriage to a niece of the Ikhshid, and Sayf al-Dawla's new domain received the<U+2014>purely formal<U+2014>sanction by the Caliph, who also re-affirmed his ''laqab'', soon thereafter.<ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="Kennedy273"/><ref>Bianquis (1998), pp. 113<U+2013>114</ref>

The truce with the Ikhshidids lasted until the death of the Ikhshid, in July 947 at Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla immediately marched south, took Damascus, and then proceeded to [[Palestine]]. There he was confronted once again by Kafur, who defeated the Hamdanid prince in a battle fought in December. Sayf al-Dawla then retreated to Damascus, and from there to Homs. There he gathered his forces, including large Arab tribal contingents, and in spring of 947, he attempted to recover Damascus. He was again defeated in battle, however, and in its aftermath the Ikhshidids even occupied Aleppo in July. Kafur, the Ikhshidid army's leader, did not press his advantage, but instead began negotiations.<ref name="EI2-105"/><ref>Bianquis (1998), pp. 114<U+2013>115</ref> For the Ikhshidids, the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus, which was Egypt's eastern bulwark. As long as their control over this region was not threatened, the Egyptians were more than willing to allow the existence of a Hamdanid state in the north. Furthermore, the Ikhshid realized that he would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining his control over northern Syria and Cilicia, which were traditionally oriented more towards the Jazira and Iraq. Not only would Egypt, threatened by this time by the [[Fatimids]] in the east, be spared the cost of maintaining a large army in these distant lands, but the Hamdanid emirate would also fulfil the useful role of a [[buffer state]] against both incursions from Iraq but also against resurgent Byzantium.<ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="Kennedy273"/><ref>Bianquis (1998), pp. 114, 115</ref> The agreement of 945 was reiterated, with the difference that the Ikhshidids ceased paying tribute for Damascus. The frontier thus established between Jaziran-influenced northern Syria and the Egyptian-controlled southern part of the country was to last until the [[Mamluks]] seized the entire country in 1260.<ref name="Kennedy273"/><ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 105, 107</ref>

Sayf al-Dawla, who returned to Aleppo in autumn, was now master of an extensive realm: the north Syrian provinces (''[[jund Hims]]'', ''[[jund Qinnasrin]]'' and the ''[[jund al-'Awasim]]'') in a line running south of Homs to the coast near [[Tartus]], and most of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar in the western Jazira. He also exercised a<U+2014>mostly nominal<U+2014>suzerainty over the towns of the Byzantine frontier in [[Cilicia]].<ref name="EI2-H129"/><ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="Kennedy274">Kennedy (2004), p. 274</ref> Sayf al-Dawla's domain was a "Syro-Mesopotamian state", in the expression of the Orientalist [[Marius Canard]], and extensive enough to require two capitals: alongside Aleppo, which became Sayf al-Dawla's main residence, Mayaffariqin was selected as the capital for the Jaziran provinces. The latter were held ostensibly in charge of his elder brother Nasir al-Dawla, but in reality, the size and political importance of Sayf al-Dawla's emirate allowed him to effectively throw off the tutelage of Nasir al-Dawla. Although Sayf al-Dawla continued to show his elder brother due deference, henceforth, their positions would be reversed.<ref name="EI2-H129"/><ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="Humphreys537">Humphreys (2010), p. 537</ref> Sayf al-Dawla lavished attention on his two capitals, endowing them with new buildings, as well as taking care of their fortifications. Of special note is the great Palace of Halba outside Aleppo, as well as the gardens and [[aqueduct]] which he built there.<ref name="EI2-105"/><ref name="Humphreys537"/>

====Arab tribal revolts====
Aside from his confrontation with the Ikhshidids, Sayf al-Dawla's consolidation over his realm was challenged by the need to maintain good relations with the restless native Arab tribes.<ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref> Northern Syria at this time was controlled by a number of Arab tribes, who had been resident in the area since the [[Umayyad]] period, and in many cases even before that. The region around Homs was settled by the [[Banu Kalb]] and the [[Banu Tayyi]], while the north, a broad stripe of land from the [[Orontes]] until beyond the [[Euphrates]] was controlled by the still largely nomadic Qaysi tribes of [[Uqayl]], [[Numayr]], [[Ka'b]] and [[Kushayr]], as well as the aforementioned Banu Kilab around Aleppo. Further south, the originally [[Yemen]]i [[Tanukh]] were settled around [[Maarat al-Numaan]], while the coasts were settled by the [[Bahra']] and Kurds.<ref name="EI2-106">Bianquis (1997), p. 106</ref>

Sayf al-Dawla befitted from the fact that he was an ethnic Arab, unlike most of the contemporary rulers in the Islamic Middle East, who were Turkish or Iranian ''[[ghilman]]'' warlords. This helped him win support among the Arab tribes, and the [[bedouins]] played a prominent role in his administration.<ref name="Humphreys538"/> However, and in common with the usual late Abbasid practice familiar to Sayf al-Dawla and common across the Middle East, the Hamdanid state was heavily reliant on and increasingly dominated by his non-Arab, mostly Turkish, ''ghilman''. This is most evident in the composition of his army, which, alongside Arab tribal cavalry, made heavy use of [[Daylamites]] and [[Sudan]]ese as infantry and Turks as [[horse archers]].<ref name="Humphreys538"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 269, 274<U+2013>275</ref>

Sayf al-Dawla's campaigns of consolidation began with a campaign to establish firm control over the Syrian littoral, as well as the routes connecting it to the interior. The operations included a difficult siege of the fortress of [[Barzuya]] in 947<U+2013>948, which was held by a Kurdish brigand leader who from there controlled the lower Orontes valley.<ref name="EI2-106"/> In central Syria, a Carmathian-inspired revolt of the Kalb and Tayyi erupted in late 949, led by a certain Ibn Hirrat al-Ramad. The rebels enjoyed temporary success, even capturing the Hamdanid governor of Homs, but they were quickly crushed.<ref name="EI2-106"/> In the north, the attempts of the Hamdanid administrators to keep the bedouin from interfering with the more settled Arab communities resulted in regular outbreaks of rebellion between 950 and 954, which had to be repeatedly suppressed by Sayf al-Dawla's army.<ref name="EI2-106"/>

Finally, in 955 a major tribal rebellion broke out which involved every tribe, both bedouin and sedentary, including the Hamdanids' close allies, the Kilab. Sayf al-Dawla was able to resolve the situation quickly, initiating a ruthless campaign of swift repression that included driving the tribes into the desert to die or capitulate, coupled with diplomacy that played on the divisions among the tribesmen. Thus the Kilab were offered peace, a return to their favoured status and were given additional lands at the expense of the Kalb, who were evicted from their homes along with the Tayyi and fled south to settle in the plains north of Damascus and the [[Golan Heights]], respectively. At the same time, the Numayr were also expelled and encouraged to resettle in the Jazira around [[Harran]].<ref name="Kennedy274"/><ref name="EI2-106"/> 

The suppression of the great tribal revolt marked, in the words of Islamic scholar [[Hugh N. Kennedy]], "the high point of Sayf al-Dawla<U+2019>s success and power".<ref name="Kennedy274"/> For a short time, during that year, his suzerainty was also acknowledged in parts of [[Azerbaijan]] around [[Salmas]], where the Kurd [[Daysam]] established brief control until evicted and finally captured by [[Marzuban ibn Muhammad]].<ref name="EI2-106"/>

===Wars with the Byzantines===
[[File:87EarlyBagratid884-962.gif|thumb|right|300px|The [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] principalities, the eastern Byzantine frontier and northern Syria and Jazira in the early 10th century]]
Through his assumption of control over the Syrian and Jaziran borderlands with Byzantium in 945/946, Sayf al-Dawla emerged as the chief Arab prince facing the Byzantine Empire, and warfare with the Byzantines became his main preoccupation.<ref name="EI2-H129"/> Indeed, much of Sayf al-Dawla's reputation stems from his unceasing, though ultimately unsuccessful war with the Empire.<ref name="Humphreys537"/><ref name="Kennedy275">Kennedy (2004), p. 275</ref> By this time, however, the Byzantines had gained the upper hand over their eastern Muslim neighbours. The onset of decline in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] after 861 (the "[[Anarchy at Samarra]]") was followed by the [[Battle of Lalakaon]] in 863, which had broken the power of the emirate of [[Malatya]] and marked the beginning the gradual Byzantine encroachment on the Arab borderlands (the ''[[Thughur]]''). Although [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] continued to resist Byzantine attacks, the emperors managed to overwhelm the [[Paulician]] allies of Malatya and advance to the Upper [[Euphrates]], occupying the mountains north of the city.<ref>Toynbee (1973), pp. 110<U+2013>111, 113<U+2013>114, 378<U+2013>380</ref><ref>Whittow (1996), pp. 310<U+2013>316, 329</ref> Finally, after 927, peace on their Balkan frontier enabled the Byzantines, under [[John Kourkouas]], to turn their forces east and begin a series of campaigns that culminated in the fall and annexation of Malatya in 934, an event which sent shock-waves among the other Muslim emirates. [[Arsamosata]] followed in 940, and Qaliqala (Byzantine Theodosiopolis, modern [[Erzurum]]) in 949.<ref>Toynbee (1973), pp. 121, 380<U+2013>381</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 479<U+2013>484</ref><ref>Whittow (1996), pp. 317<U+2013>322</ref> 

The Byzantine advance evoked a great emotional response in the Muslim world, with volunteers, both soldiers and civilians, flocking to participate in the ''[[jihad]]'' against the Empire. Sayf al-Dawla was also affected by this atmosphere, and became deeply impregnated with the spirit of ''jihad''.<ref name="EI2-106"/><ref name="Humphreys538">Humphreys (2010), p. 538</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 277<U+2013>278</ref> The rise of the Hamdanid brothers to power in the frontier provinces and the Jazira is therefore to be regarded against the backdrop of the Byzantine threat, as well as the manifest inability of the Abbasid government to stem the Byzantine offensive.<ref name="Kennedy276">Kennedy (2004), p. 276</ref><ref>Whittow (1996), p. 318</ref> In Hugh Kennedy's words, "compared with the inaction or indifference of other Muslim rulers, it is not surprising that Sayf al-Dawla's popular reputation remained high; he was the one man who attempted to defend the Faith, the essential hero of the time".<ref name="Kennedy278">Kennedy (2004), p. 278</ref>

====Early campaigns====
Sayf al-Dawla entered the fray against the Byzantines in 936, when he led an expedition to the aid of [[Samosata]], at the time besieged by the Byzantines. A revolt in his rear forced him to abandon the campaign.

According to Mark Whittow, a more sustained policy could have made use of the Armenian princes' distrust of Byzantine expansionism, to form a network of clients and contain the Byzantine expansion. Instead, the Byzantines were given a free hand, which allowed them to press on and capture Qaliqala, cementing their control over the region.<ref name="Kennedy276"/><ref name="EI2-107"/><ref>Whittow (1996), pp. 320, 322</ref>

====Sayf al-Dawla's ascendancy, 945<U+2013>955====
[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Arab<U+2013>Byzantine frontier zone]]
After establishing himself at Aleppo in 944, Sayf al-Dawla resumed warfare against Byzantium in 945/946. From this time until the time of his death, he was the Byzantines' chief antagonist in the East<U+2014>by the end of his life Sayf al-Dawla was said to have fought them in over forty battles.<ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref><ref name="Whittow320">Whittow (1996), p. 320</ref> Nevertheless, despite his frequent and destructive raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces and into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]], and his victories in the field, his mode of warfare was essentially defensive, and he never seriously attempted to challenge Byzantine control of the crucial mountain passes or conclude alliances with other local rulers in an effort to roll back the Byzantine conquests. As the ruler of a minor principality, Sayf al-Dawla could not match the means and numbers available to resurgent Byzantium: the contemporary Arab sources report<U+2014>with obvious, but nonetheless indicative, exaggeration<U+2014>that Byzantine armies numbered up to 200,000, while Sayf al-Dawla's largest force numbered some 30,000.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Whittow320"/><ref name="Kennedy277">Kennedy (2004), p. 277</ref> Sayf al-Dawla's origin in the Jazira also affected his strategic outlook: contrary to most Syria-based polities, both Sayf al-Dawla and his successors neglected constructing a fleet or paying any attention at all to the Mediterranean.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Kennedy274"/> 

Sayf al-Dawla's raid of winter 945/946 was of limited scale, and was followed by a prisoner exchange.<ref name="EI2-107"/> Warfare on the frontiers then died down for a couple of years, and recommenced only in 948.<ref>Whittow (1996), p. 322</ref> Despite scoring a victory over a Byzantine invasion in 948, he was unable to prevent the sack of [[Hadath]], one of the main Muslim strongholds in the Euphrates ''Thughur'', by [[Leo Phokas the Younger|Leo Phokas]], one of the sons of the Byzantine [[Domestic of the Schools]] (commander-in-chief) [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas Phokas]].<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 488<U+2013>489</ref><ref>Whittow (1996), p. 322</ref> Sayf al-Dawla's expeditions in the next two years were also failures. In 949 he raided into the [[thema|theme]] of [[Lykandos]] but was driven back, and the Byzantines proceeded to sack [[Marash]], defeat a Tarsian army and raid as far as [[Antioch]]. In the next year, Sayf al-Dawla led a large force into Byzantine territory, ravaging the themes of Lykandos and [[Charsianon]], but on his return he was ambushed by Leo Phokas in a mountain pass. In what became known as the ''ghazwat al-musiba'', the "dreadful expedition", Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Treadgold489">Treadgold (1997), p. 489</ref>

Sayf al-Dawla nevertheless rejected offers of peace from the Byzantines, and launched another raid against Lykandos and Malatya, persisting until the onset of winter forced him to retire.<ref name="Treadgold489"/> In the next year, he concentrated his attention on rebuilding the fortresses of Cilicia and northern Syria, including Marash and Hadath. Bardas Phokas launched an expedition to obstruct these works, but was defeated. Bardas launched another campaign in 953, but despite having a considerably larger force at his disposal, he was [[Battle of Marash (953)|heavily defeated]] near Marash in a battle celebrated by Sayf al-Dawla's [[panegyrist]]s. The Byzantine commander even lost his youngest son, [[Constantine Phokas|Constantine]], to Hamdanid captivity. Another expedition led by Bardas in the next year was also defeated, allowing Sayf al-Dawla to complete the refortification of [[Samosata]] and Hadath. The latter successfully withstood yet another Byzantine attack in 955.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Treadgold492">Treadgold (1997), p. 492</ref>

====Byzantine ascendancy, 956<U+2013>962====

Sayf al-Dawla's victories brought about the replacement of Bardas by his eldest son, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]]. Blessed with capable subordinates like his brother Leo and the Armenian [[John Tzimiskes]], Nikephoros would bring about a reversal of fortunes in Sayf al-Dawla's struggle with the Byzantines.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Treadgold492"/> The young general also benefited from the culmination of military reforms that created a more professional army.<ref>On the nature of these reforms, cf. Whittow (1996), pp. 323<U+2013>325</ref> In spring 956, Sayf al-Dawla pre-empted Tzimiskes from a planned assault on [[Amida (Mesopotamia)|Amida]], and invaded Byzantine territory first. Tzimiskes then seized a pass in Sayf al-Dawla's rear, and attacked him during his return. The hard-fought battle, fought amidst torrential rainfall, resulted in a Muslim victory as Tzimiskes lost 4,000 men. At the same time, however, Leo Phokas invaded Syria and defeated and captured Sayf al-Dawla's cousin, whom he had left behind in his stead. Later in the year, Sayf al-Dawla was obliged to go to Tarsus to help repel a raid by the Byzantine [[Cibyrrhaeot]] fleet.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref name="Treadgold492"/> In 957, Nikephoros took and razed Hadath, but Sayf al-Dawla was unable to react as he discovered a conspiracy by some of his officers to surrender him to the Byzantines in exchange for money. Sayf al-Dawla executed 180 of his ''ghilman'' and mutilated over 200 others in retaliation.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 492<U+2013>493</ref> In the next spring, Tzimiskes invaded the Jazira, captured [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]], and scored a victory at Amida over an army of 10,000 led by one of Sayf al-Dawla's favourite lieutenants, the [[Circassians|Circassian]] Nadja. Together with the ''[[parakoimomenos]]'' [[Basil Lekapenos]], he then stormed Samosata, and even inflicted a [[Battle of Raban|heavy defeat]] on a relief army under Sayf al-Dawla himself. The Byzantines exploited Hamdanid weakness, and in 959 Leo Phokas led a raid as far as [[Cyrrhus]], sacking several forts on their way.<ref name="EI2-107"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 493</ref>

[[File:Capture of Berroia by the Byzantines.png|thumb|right|300px|Capture of Aleppo by the Byzantines, miniature from the ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]'']]
In 960, Sayf al-Dawla tried to use the absence of Nikephoros Phokas with much of his army on his [[Byzantine reconquest of Crete|Cretan expedition]], to re-establish his position. At the head of a large army, he invaded Byzantine territory and sacked the fortress of Charsianon. On his return, however, his army was [[Battle of Andrassos|attacked and almost annihilated]] in an ambush by Leo Phokas and his troops. Once again, Sayf al-Dawla managed to escape, but his military power was broken. The local governors now began to make terms with the Byzantines on their own, and the Hamdanid's authority was increasingly questioned even in his own capital.<ref name="Kennedy277"/><ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 107<U+2013>108</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 495</ref> Sayf al-Dawla now needed time, but as soon as Nikephoros Phokas returned victorious from Crete in summer 961, he began preparations for his next campaign in the east. The Byzantines launched their attack in the winter months, catching the Arabs off guard. They captured [[Anazarbus]] in [[Cilicia]], and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. After Nikephoros repaired to Byzantine territory to celebrate [[Easter]], Sayf al-Dawla entered Cilicia and claimed direct control over the province. He began to rebuild Anazarbus, but the work was left incomplete when Nikephoros recommenced his offensive in autumn, forcing Sayf al-Dawla to depart the region.<ref name="EI2-108">Bianquis (1997), p. 108</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 495<U+2013>496</ref> The Byzantines, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, proceeded to take Marash, [[Sisium]], [[Duluk]] and [[Manbij]], thereby securing the western passes over the [[Anti-Taurus Mountains]]. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. After defeating an improvised army before the city walls, the Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. Returning to his ruined and half-deserted capital<U+2014>the Byzantines had taken captive some 10,000 inhabitants, mostly young men<U+2014>Sayf al-Dawla repopulated it with refugees from [[Qinnasrin]].<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 277, 279</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 496<U+2013>497</ref><ref name="Whittow326">Whittow (1996), p. 326</ref>

===Illness, rebellions and death===
In 963, as Nikephoros was scheming to ascend the imperial throne,<ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 498<U+2013>499</ref> Sayf al-Dawla was troubled by the onset of [[hemiplegia]] as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, which henceforth confined him to a [[litter]]. The disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; coupled with his military failures, especially the capture of Aleppo in 962, his authority became increasingly shaky among his subordinates, for whom military success was the prerequisite for political legitimacy.<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref name="Kennedy279">Kennedy (2004), p. 279</ref> Sayf al-Dawla abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, [[Qarquya]], and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior ''ghilman'' to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that sprung up in his domains.<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref name="Kennedy279"/>

Thus, in 961, the emir of Tarsus, Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ibn al-Zayyat, unsuccessfully tried to turn over his province to the Ikhshidids. In 963, his nephew, the governor of [[Harran]], Hibat Allah, rebelled after killing Sayf al-Dawla's trusted Christian secretary in favour of his father, Nasir al-Dawla.<ref name="EI2-108"/> Nadja was sent to subdue the rebellion, forcing Hibat Allah to flee to his father's court, but then Nadja himself rebelled and attacked Mayyafariqin, defended by Sayf al-Dawla's wife, with the intention of turning it over to the [[Buyids]]. He failed, and retreated to Armenia, where he managed to take over a few fortresses around [[Lake Van]]. In autumn 964 he again attempted to take Mayyafariqin, but was obliged to abandon it to subdue a revolt in his new Armenian domains. Sayf al-Dawla himself travelled to Armenia to meet his former lieutenant. Nadja re-submitted to his authority without resistance, but was murdered in winter 945 at Mayyafariqin, probably at the behest of Sayf al-Dawla's wife.<ref name="EI2-108"/>

Nevertheless, despite his illness and the spreading famine in his domains, in 963 Sayf al-Dawla launched three raids into Asia Minor. One of them even reached as far as [[Iconium]], but Tzimiskes, named Nikephoros' successor as Domestic of the East, responded by launching an invasion of Cilicia in winter. He destroyed an Arab army at the "Field of Blood" near [[Adana]], and unsuccessfully besieged [[Mopsuestia]] before lack of supplies forced him to return home. In autumn 964, when Nikephoros, now emperor, again campaigned in the East, he met little resistance. Mopsuestia was besieged but held out, until the famine that plagued the province forced even the Byzantines to withdraw.<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 499</ref> Nikephoros however returned in the next year and stormed the city and deported its inhabitants. In August, Tarsus was surrendered by its inhabitants on 16 August 965, who secured safe passage to Antioch. Cilicia became Byzantine province, and Nikephoros proceeded to re-Christianize it.<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref name="Whittow326"/><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 278<U+2013>279</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 500<U+2013>501</ref> In the same year, Sayf al-Dawla was also heavily affected by the death of two of his sons, Abu 'l Maqarim and Abu 'l Baraqat.<ref name="EI2-108"/>

The year 965 also saw two further large-scale rebellions within Sayf al-Dawla's domains. The first was led by a former governor of the coast, the ex-Carmathian Marwan al-'Uqayli, which grew to threatening dimensions: the rebels captured Homs, defeated an army sent against them and advanced up to Aleppo, but Al-'Uqayli was wounded in the battle for the city and died shortly after.<ref name="EI2-108"/><ref name="Kennedy279"/> In autumn, a more serious revolt broke out in Antioch, led by the former governor of Tarsus, Rashiq ibn Abdallah al-Nasimi. The rebellion was obviously motivated by Sayf al-Dawla's inability to stop the Byzantine advance. After raising an army in the town, Rashiq led it to besiege Aleppo, which was defended by Sayf al-Dawla's ''ghilman'', Qarguya and Bishara. Three months into the siege, the rebels had taken possession of part of the lower town, when Rashiq was killed. He was succeeded by a [[Daylamite]] named Dizbar. Dizbar defeated Qarquya and took Aleppo, but then departed the town to take control over the rest of northern Syria.<ref name="Kennedy279"/><ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 108<U+2013>109</ref>

In early 966, Sayf al-Dawla asked for and received a short truce and an exchange of prisoners with the Byzantines, which was held at Samosata. He ransomed many Muslim captives at great cost, only to see them go over to Dizbar's forces. Sayf al-Dawla resolved to confront the rebel: carried on his litter, he returned to Aleppo, and on the next day defeated the rebel's army, helped by the defection of the Banu Kilab from Dizbar. The surviving rebels were ruthlessly punished.<ref name="Kennedy279"/><ref name="EI2-lastyears">Bianquis (1997), pp. 108, 109</ref> However, Sayf al-Dawla was still unable to confront Nikephoros when he resumed his advance. The Hamdanid ruler fled to the safety of the fortress of [[Shayzar]], while the Byzantines raided the Jazira before turning on northern Syria, were they launched attacks on Manbij, Aleppo and even Antioch, whose newly appointed governor, Taki al-Din Muhammad ibn Musa, went over to them with the city's treasury.<ref name="EI2-lastyears"/><ref name="Whittow326"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), pp. 501<U+2013>502</ref> In early February 967, Sayf al-Dawla returned to Aleppo, where he died a few days later (although a source claims that he died at Mayyafariqin). His body was embalmed and buried at a mausoleum in Mayyafariqin beside his mother and sister. A brick made from dust collected from his armour after his campaigns was reportedly placed under his head. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Abu 'l Ma'ali Sharif, better known as [[Sa'd al-Dawla]].<ref name="EI2-lastyears"/><ref name="Kennedy280">Kennedy (2004), p. 280</ref>

==Cultural activities==
Sayf al-Dawla surrounded himself with prominent intellectual figures, most notably the great poets [[al-Mutanabbi]] and [[Abu Firas al-Hamdani|Abu Firas]] (who was Sayf al-Dawla's cousin), the preacher [[Ibn Nubata]], and the noted philosopher [[al-Farabi]].<ref>Humphreys (2010), pp. 537<U+2013>538</ref><ref>For a full list of the scholars associated with Sayf al-Dawla's court, cf. Bianquis (1997), p. 103</ref> Sayf al-Dawla paid special favour to poets, but his court contained scholars versed in religious studies, history, philosophy and astronomy as well. As S. Humphreys comments, "In his time Aleppo could certainly have held its own with any court in [[Renaissance Italy]]".<ref name="Humphreys538"/><ref name="EI2-103"/> Sayf al-Dawla's patronage of poets had a useful political dividend too: it was part of a court poet's duty to his patron to celebrate him in his work, and through their poetry, the influence of Sayf al-Dawla and his court spread far across the Muslim world.<ref>Bianquis (1997), pp. 103<U+2013>104</ref>

==Assessment==
[[File:Sayf al-Dawla at his court.png|thumb|right|300px|Depiction of Sayf al-Dawla ("the Habdan") and his court, from the 13th-century ''Madrid Skylitzes'']]
Sayf al-Dawla has remained to this day one of the best-known medieval Arab leaders. His bravery and leadership of the war against the Byzantines, despite the heavy odds against him, his literary activities and patronage of poets which lent his court an unmatched cultural brilliance, the calamities which struck him towards his end<U+2014>defeat, illness and betrayal<U+2014>have made him, in the words of Th. Bianquis, "from his time until the present day", the personification of the "Arab chivalrous ideal in its most tragic aspect".<ref name="EI2-103">Bianquis (1997), p. 103</ref><ref>Humphreys (2010), pp. 537<U+2013>539</ref><ref name="Kennedy265">Kennedy (2004), p. 265</ref> Sayf al-Dawla was also unusual for 10th-century Syria in his espousal of [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a Islam]] in a hitherto solidly [[Sunni]] country. His active promotion of Shi'ism began a process whereby Syria came to host a large Shi'a population by the 12th century.<ref name="Humphreys538"/> His choice of Aleppo and Mayyafariqin as his two capitals raised them from obscurity to the status of major urban centres. Aleppo especially benefited from Sayf al-Dawla's attention, and its rise to the chief city in northern Syria dates from his reign.<ref name="Humphreys537">Humphreys (2010), p. 537</ref> 

Nevertheless, the picture presented by his contemporaries on the impact of Sayf al-Dawla's policies is less favourable: the 10th-century chronicler [[Ibn Hawqal]], who travelled the Hamdanid domains, paints a dismal picture of economic oppression and exploitation of the local people, linked with the Hamdanid practice of expropriating extensive estates in the most fertile areas and practising a [[monoculture]] of cereals destined to feed the growing population of Baghdad. This was coupled with heavy taxation, so that Sayf al-Dawla and Nasir al-Dawla are said to have become the wealthiest princes in the Muslim world. This allowed them to maintain their lavish courts, but at a heavy price to their subjects' long-term prosperity. In Kennedy's words, "even the capital of Aleppo seems to have been more prosperous under the following [[Mirdasid]] dynasty than under the Hamdanids", while Bianquis claims that Sayf al-Dawla's wars and economic policies both contributed to a permanent alteration in the landscape: "by destroying orchards and peri-urban market gardens, by enfeebling the once vibrant [[polyculture]] and by depopulating the sedentarised steppe terrain of the frontiers, the Hamdanids contributed to the erosion of the deforested land and to the seizure by semi-nomadic tribes of the agricultural lands of these regions in the 11th century".<ref name="Kennedy265"/><ref name="EI2-109">Bianquis (1997), p. 109</ref>

His military record was also, in the end, one of failure: the Byzantine advance continued after his death, culminating in the fall of Antioch in 969. Aleppo was transformed into a vassal state tributary to Byzantium, and for the next fifty years it would become the bone of contention between the Byzantines and a Muslim power new to the Middle East, the Egypt-based [[Fatimid Caliphate]].<ref name="Kennedy280"/><ref>Whittow (1996), pp. 326<U+2013>327</ref> The Hamdanids' military defeat was in the end inevitable, given the disparity of strength and resources with the Empire. This was compounded by the failure of Nasir al-Dawla to support his brother in his wars against Byzantium, by the Hamdanids' preoccupation with internal revolts, and the feebleness of their authority over much of their domains. As the historian Mark Whittow comments, Sayf al-Dawla's martial reputation often masks the reality that his power was "a paper tiger, short of money, short of soldiers and with little real base in the territories he controlled".<ref>Whittow (1996), p. 334</ref>
