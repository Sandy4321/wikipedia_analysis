:''Not to be confused with [[XXX syndrome]]. For the Luc<U+00ED>a Puenzo film, see [[XXY (film)]].''
'''Klinefelter's syndrome''', '''47, XXY''' or '''XXY syndrome''' is a condition caused by a [[chromosome]] [[aneuploidy]]. Affected males have an extra [[XY sex-determination system|X sex chromosome]]. The principal effect is small testes development and reduced [[fertility]]. A variety of other physical and behavioral differences and problems are common, though severity varies and many boys and men with the condition have few detectable symptoms. It is the second most common extra chromosome condition, and is named after Dr. Harry Klinefelter, an [[endocrinologist]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]], who first described it in [[1942]].<ref name="kline1942">{{Citation| last = Klinefelter | first = HF Jr | last2 = Reifenstein | first2 = EC Jr | last3 = Albright | title = Syndrome characterized by gynecomastia, aspermatogenesis without a-Leydigism and increased excretion of follicle-stimulating hormone. | journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab | volume = 2 | pages = 615-624 | date = 1942 | year = 1942 | id = PMID: ''too early to be indexed''}}. {{Citation| last = Klinefelter | first = HF | title = Klinefelter's syndrome: historical background and development. | journal = South Med J | volume = 79 | issue = 9 | pages = 1089-1093 | date = 1986 | year =1986 | id =  PMID: 3529433}} talks about the history of the development of the literature.</ref> The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500 to 1,000 males.<ref name="nihhd2007">{{cite web| title = Klinefelter Syndrome | work = Health Information | publisher = National Institute of Health and Human Development | date = [[2007-02-19]] | url = http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/klinefelter_syndrome.cfm | format = HTML | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }} and {{cite web | title = Klinefelter syndrome | work = Genetics Home Reference | publisher = National Library of Medicine | year = 2006 | url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition%3Dklinefeltersyndrome | format = HTML | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }} both provide statistical estimates.</ref>

The term "[[hypogonadism]]" in XXY symptoms is often misinterpreted to mean "small testicles" or "small penis". In fact, it means decreased testicular hormone/endocrine function. Because of this hypogonadism, patients will often have a low serum [[Testosterone|testosterone]] level but high serum [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[Luteinizing hormone|luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels.<ref name="nlhclingen2005">{{cite web| last = Leask | first = Kathryn | title = Klinefelter syndrome | work = National Library for Health, Specialist Libraries, Clinical Genetics | publisher = National Library for Health | date = October 2005 | url = http://www.library.nhs.uk/genepool/ViewResource.aspx?resID=104897 | format = HTML | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}</ref> Despite this misunderstanding of the term, however, it is true that XXY men often also have "microorchidism" (i.e. small testicles).<ref name="nlhclingen2005" />

The more severe end of the [[spectrum]] of symptom expression is also associated with an increased risk of [[germ cell tumors]]<ref>Mediastinal germ cell tumor in a child with precocious puberty and Klinefelter syndrome.

Additionally, extant medical literature shows some individual case studies of Klinefelter's syndrome coexisting with other disorders, such as [[pulmonary disease]], [[varicose vein]]s, [[diabetes mellitus]], and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], but the etiologies (understanding of any potential causation relationship) between Klinefelter's and these other conditions are not well characterized or understood. 

In contrast to these potentially increased risks, it is currently thought that rare [[Sex linked|X-linked recessive]] conditions occur even less frequently in XXY males than in normal XY males, since these conditions are transmitted by genes on the X chromosome, and people with two X chromosomes are typically only carriers rather than affected by these X-linked recessive conditions.

There are many variances within the XXY population, just as in the most common [[46,XY]] population. While it is possible to characterise 47,XXY males with certain body types, that in itself should not be the method of identification as to whether someone has 47,XXY or not. The only reliable method of identification is [[karyotype]] testing.

==Cause==
The extra X chromosome is retained because of a [[Meiosis#Nondisjunction|nondisjunction]] event during [[meiosis]] (sex cell division). The XXY chromosome arrangement is one of the most common genetic variations from the XY [[karyotype]], occurring in about 1 in 500 to 1,000 live male births.<ref name="nihhd2007" /> Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as "XXY Males", or "47,XXY Males".<ref name="orrnichhd1993full">{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/klinefelter.cfm |title=Understanding Klinefelter Syndrome: A Guide for XXY Males and Their Families |last=Bock |first=Robert  |accessdate=2007-04-07 |date = 1993 Aug |year = 1993 | month = August |format=HTML |work=NIH Pub.

In [[mammal]]s with more than one X chromosome, the [[gene|genes]] on all but one X chromosome [[X-inactivation|are not expressed]]; this is known as X inactivation.  This happens in XXY males as well as normal XX females.<ref name="arghg2005">Chow J, Yen Z, Ziesche S, Brown C (2005). "Silencing of the mammalian X chromosome". Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet 6: 69-92.

The first published report of a man with a 47,XXY karyotype was by Patricia A. Jacobs and Dr. J.A. Strong at [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]] in 1959.<ref name="nature1959">{{cite journal |author=Jacobs PA, Strong JA |month=January 31, |year=1959 |title=A case of human intersexuality having a possible XXY sex-determining mechanism |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=183 |issue=4657 |pages=302-3 |id=PMID 13632697 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v183/n4657/abs/183302a0.html}}</ref> This karyotype was found in a 24-year-old man who had signs of Klinefelter's syndrome. Dr. Jacobs described her discovery of this first reported human or mammalian chromosome [[aneuploidy]] in her 1981 William Allan Memorial Award address.<ref name="amjhumgenet1982">{{cite journal |author=Jacobs PA |month=September |year=1982 |title=The William Allan Memorial Award address: human population cytogenetics: the first twenty-five years |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics|Am J Hum Genet]] |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=689-98 |id=PMID 6751075 |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1685430&blobtype=pdf}}</ref>

==Treatment==
The genetic variation is irreversible, but its symptoms can be altered or treated in a number of ways, including testosterone treatment and other therapies.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} 

Inadequately treated [[hypogonadism]] in Klinefelter syndrome increases recognized [[psychosocial|psychosocial morbidity]].<ref name="jpediatrendo2006">Simm PJ, Zacharin MR. "The psychosocial impact of Klinefelter syndrome--a 10 year review". ''J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab'' 2006 Apr;19(4):499-505. PMID 16759035</ref> At least one study indicates that planned and timed support should be provided for young men with Klinefelter syndrome, to ameliorate current poor psychosocial outcomes.<ref name="jpediatrendo2006" />

==Variations==
The 48, XXYY (male) syndrome occurs 1 in 17,000 births and has traditionally been considered to be a variation of Klinefelter's syndrome. XXYY is no longer generally considered a variation of KS, although it has not yet been assigned an ICD-10 code.

Males with Klinefelter syndrome may have a [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] 47,XXY/46,XY constitutional [[karyotype]] and varying degrees of spermatogenic failure. Mosaicism 47,XXY/46,XX with clinical features suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome is very rare. Thus far, only about 10 cases have been described in literature.<ref name="eurjmedgenet2006">Velissariou V, Christopoulou S, Karadimas C, Pihos I, Kanaka-Gantenbein C, Kapranos N, Kallipolitis G, Hatzaki A. "Rare XXY/XX mosaicism in a phenotypic male with Klinefelter syndrome: case report". '' Eur J Med Genet'' 2006 July - August;49(4):331-337. PMID 16829354</ref>

==Complications==
Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have a 50 times greater risk of [[germ cell tumors]] (GSTs).<ref>Mediastinal germ cell tumor in a child with precocious puberty and Klinefelter syndrome.  Gregory G. Bebb, Frederic W. Grannis, Jr, Isaac B. Paz, Marilyn L. Slovak, Robert Chilcote. Ann Thorac Surg 1998;66:547-548.  [http://ats.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/66/2/547 Online}</ref>  In these patients, GSTs usually contain nonseminomatous elements, present at an earlier age, and seldom are testicular in location.
