'''Richard Bernard "Red" Skelton''' (July 18, 1913{{spaced ndash}}September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer best known for his national [[old-time radio|radio]] and television acts between 1937 and 1971 and as host of the television program ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''. Skelton, who has stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for his work in radio and television, also appeared in [[vaudeville]], films, [[nightclub]]s, and [[casino]]s, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.

Skelton learned his comedic and pantomime skills beginning at age 10, when he became part of a traveling [[medicine show]]. He then spent time on a [[showboat]], worked the [[burlesque]] circuit, then entered into vaudeville in 1934. A [[pantomime]] sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife launched a career for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films. Skelton's radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' which led to his becoming the host of ''Avalon Time'' in 1938. He moved to ''The Raleigh Cigarettes Program'' in 1941 where many of his comedy characters were created and had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957.  Skelton was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. ''The Red Skelton Show'' made its television premiere on September 30, 1951 on NBC.  By 1954, Skelton's program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed ''The Red Skelton Hour'' in 1962. Despite high ratings, his television show was canceled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. After he no longer had a television program, Skelton's time was spent making up to 125 personal appearances a year and on his artwork.

Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964, when his wife, Georgia, convinced him to have a showing of his work at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful and Skelton also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.

Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh and wanted to be known as a clown, because he defined it as being able to do everything.  He had a 70 year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans during this time.  Many of Skelton's personal and professional effects, including prints of his artwork, were donated to [[Vincennes University]] by his widow, where they are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy.

==Biography==

===Early years, the medicine show and the circus===
Born July 18, 1913 in [[Vincennes, Indiana]], Richard Skelton was the fourth son of Ida Mae (n<U+00E9>e Fields) and Joseph E. Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before his last child was born; he had once been a [[clown]] with the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus]].<ref name=NYTObit>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/18/arts/red-skelton-knockabout-comic-and-clown-prince-of-the-airwaves-is-dead-at-84.html?src=pm|title=Red Skelton, Knockabout Comic and Clown Prince of the Airwaves, Is Dead at 84|author=Severo, Richard|date=September 18, 1997|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Obit>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F_RLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2u0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6805,971926&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Lovable Clown Red Skelton Dies|date=September 18, 1997|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=May 18, 2011}}</ref> In Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth.

At the age of ten, Skelton auditioned to be part of a [[medicine show]]. When he accidentally fell from the stage, breaking bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed; the young boy realized he could earn a living with this ability. Skelton worked in the medicine show for four years.  The pay was ten dollars a week and he sent all of it home weekly to his mother telling her, "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon."<ref name=saga>{{cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/ra00mac#page/n435/mode/2up|title=The Skelton Saga|author=Swanson, Pauline|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|date=April 1949|pages=56<U+2013>50, 93<U+2013>99|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref>

By age 14, Skelton had left school and was already a veteran performer, working in local vaudeville and on a [[showboat]], "The Cotton Blossom", that traveled the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Missouri River|Missouri]] rivers.<ref name=NYTObit/> Skelton enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that the days of showboats would soon come to an end.<ref name=LAobit>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/18/news/mn-33654|title=Red Skelton, TV and Film's Quintessential Clown, Dies|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 1997|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}</ref>  Young Skelton was interested in all forms of acting.

===Burlesque to vaudeville===
[[File:Red and Edna Skelton at home 1942.jpg|thumb|Red and Edna Skelton at home, 1942.]]  
When the atmosphere of burlesque comedy began to take a turn toward [[Ribaldry#Blue comedy|blue material]], Skelton, who declared himself to be no prude, said, "I just didn't think the lines were funny". He moved on to [[dance marathon]]s, popular in the 1930s and referred to as "walkathons" at that time.

The couple's hopes were to somehow find work in New York City and break into vaudeville there.<ref name=Franchey/>  Skelton and his wife put together an act and began to get bookings for it at some of the smaller theaters. When an offer came for a booking in [[Harwich Port, Massachusetts]], some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, the couple was pleased to get it because it was nearer New York City, the capital of vaudeville, than they were at the time.  To get to Massachusetts, they bought a used car, borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, and set out on the road.  By the time they arrived in St. Louis, the five dollars had become a mere fifty cents.  When Skelton suggested to his wife that they pick up empty cigarette packs for the tinfoil, Edna thought he was joking but did as he asked.  Skelton then spent the couple's fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the smoothed-out tinfoil from the collected cigarette packs.  Red and Edna then marketed their product as fog remover for eyeglasses, selling the foil wrapped soap cubes for fifty cents each. The Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room that evening and for every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port, selling the eyeglass fog remover.<ref name=saga/>

====The doughnut dunkers====
[[File:Red Skelton and John Garfield at FDR Birthday Ball 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Skelton with [[John Garfield]] at the 1944 FDR Birthday Ball.]]
Red and Edna worked for a year in [[Camden, New Jersey]], and were able to get an engagement at [[Montreal]]'s Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]].<ref name=saga/> Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought the couple theater dates throughout Canada.<ref name=LAobit/> While in Montreal, they ran into a New York vaudeville producer, who promised the pair a booking at Loew's State Theatre if Skelton could come up with a new routine for the engagement. Edna had an idea as they were having breakfast in a hotel coffee shop. Skelton and Edna devised the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate [[doughnut]]s. The skit won him the promised Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.<ref name=Franchey/><ref name="Adir, p. 197">Adir, p. 197</ref>

The Skeltons viewed this engagement as Red's big chance.  They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for Skelton's Loew's engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the material Red normally performed.  His New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton  abandoned the newly written material and began performing his "Doughnut Dunkers" and other older routines.<ref name=LAobit/>{{#tag:ref|The problem with doing the "Doughnut Dunkers" skit was that Skelton had to eat nine doughnuts at every performance. He was performing five times a day and eating 45 doughnuts.

Roosevelt]] invited him to perform at a [[White House]] luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President.  I got rolled in a place like this once." Skelton's humor appealed to FDR and he became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.<ref name=laugh/>

Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television.

===Radio, divorce and remarriage===
The "Doughnut Dunkers" routine led to Skelton's first appearance on [[Rudy Vallee]]'s ''The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour'' on August 12, 1937. Vallee's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. The show received enough fan mail after Skelton's performance to invite the comedian back two weeks after his initial appearance and again in November of that year. On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced [[Red Foley]] as the host of ''Avalon Time'' on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioechoes.com/avalon-time|title=Avalon Time|publisher=Radio Echoes|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref> She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=465IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ngENAAAAIBAJ&pg=1219,5830865&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Writers Tell How His Gags Are Launched|author=Thomas, Bob|date=March 26, 1949|work=The Meriden Daily Journal|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref>  Skelton hosted the show until late 1939.<ref>Hyatt, pp. 9<U+2013>11</ref>
His work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, Skelton promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.<ref name=dood/>  Skelton went on the air with his own radio show, ''The Raleigh Cigarettes Program'', on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was [[Ozzie Nelson]]; his wife, [[Harriet Nelson|Harriet]], who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=The+Raleigh+Cigarette+Program+Starring+Red+Skelton|title=The Raleigh Cigarette Program Starring Red Skelton|author=Goldin, J.

Skelton introduced the first two of his many characters during ''The Raleigh Cigarettes Program's'' first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper was based on a Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was very much like that of the later cartoon character, [[Bullwinkle J. Moose|Bullwinkle]]. They were sufficiently similar to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose.<ref name="Hyatt, p. 11">Hyatt, p. 11</ref> The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. "Junior" would say things like, "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, "I dood it!"<ref name="Hyatt, p. 11"/> Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname "Junior" long before it was heard by a radio audience.<ref>Adir, p. 199</ref> While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea to try using the character on the radio show was Edna's.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TFIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1406,611914&dq=richard+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton's Success Due Wife|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=March 5, 1942|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref> Skelton starred in [[I Dood It|a 1942 movie of the same name]], but did not play "Junior" in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EOJXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UvUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3401,1393945&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton, Powell in Lively Picture|date=June 6, 1942|publisher=Spokane Daily Chronicle|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

The phrase was such a part of national culture at the time, when [[Jimmy Doolittle|General Doolittle]] conducted the [[Doolittle Raid|bombing of Tokyo]] in 1942, many newspapers used the phrase "Doolittle Dood It" as a headline.<ref name=dood/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MAwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT115&lpg=PT115&dq=doolittle+dood+it#v=onepage&q=doolittle%20dood%20it&f=false|title=Doolittle Dood It|author=Churvis, Mac|date=May 30, 1942|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DlAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=doolittle+dood+it#v=onepage&q=doolittle%20dood%20it&f=false|title=Life on the Newsfronts of the World|date=June 1, 1942|publisher=Life|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> After a talk with President Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a [[Douglas A-20 Havoc]] to be given to the [[Soviet Army]] to help fight [[World War II]]. Asking children to send in their spare change, Skelton raised enough money for the aircraft in two weeks. He named the bomber "We Dood It!" In 1986 the Soviet newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' offered praise to Skelton for his 1943 gift and in 1993, the pilot of the plane was able to meet Skelton and thank him for the bomber.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=h1BBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AakMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6915,4265444&dq=red+skelton+dood&hl=en|title=Red Skelton Wins Praise in Soviet Union|date=November 7, 1986|author=Shabad, Theodore|publisher=Harlan Daily Enterprise|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=y-UiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=S7UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4790,5948601&dq=red+skelton+bomber&hl=en|title=Pilot thanks Red Skelton for warplane|date=May 25, 1993|work=Beaver County Times|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called "Mellow Cigars" by Skelton, the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; Skelton renamed the routine "Guzzler's Gin", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor's wares.<ref name=Recluse>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ufhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jU0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=6633,6965434&dq=red+skelton+queen&hl=en|title=Red Skelton Is No Recluse|date=April 17, 1984|publisher=The Mount Airy News|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience [[Warm-up comedian|warm-up]] in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite.  After the regular radio program had ended, the studio audience was treated to a post-program performance.  Skelton would then perform his "Guzzler's Gin" or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show.  He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program.  As a result, studio audience tickets for the Skelton radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people needed to be turned away for lack of seats.<ref name=laugh/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&pg=PA569&lpg=PA569&dq=edna+skelton+pound#v=onepage&q=edna%20skelton%20pound&f=false|title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|editor-last=Dunning|editor-first=John|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=570|isbn=0-19-507678-8|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>

====Divorce from Edna, marriage to Georgia====
In 1942, Edna announced that she was leaving the Skelton home but would continue to manage Skelton's career and write material for him. Skelton did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC, Skelton's radio employer.<ref name=Edna>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lJFRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CmoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2824,1087338&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Mrs. Skelton Quits as Red's Wife, Stays on as Red's Agent|date=October 30, 1942|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm.<ref name=Marry/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WotjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G3oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5252,3459226&dq=richard+skelton&hl=en|title=Leave Arm In Arm|date=February 12, 1943|publisher=Saskatoon Star-Phoenix|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref> The couple did not discuss the reasons for their divorce and Edna initially prepared to work as a script writer for other radio programs.  When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Those associated with Skelton sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to Skelton in a professional capacity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440116&id=ITYdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EiMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4119,555916|title=Divorce Can't Part Edna and Red|author=Daniel, Jesse|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=January 16, 1944|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref> Edna was also the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets.<ref name=laugh>{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1950apr15-00022|title=Is He a Big Laugh!|editor-last=Shearer|editor-first=Lloyd|pages=22<U+2013>23, 55|date=April 15, 1950|publisher=Collier's Weekly|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref> She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EXpWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5-UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5192,3087023&dq=edna+skelton&hl=en|title=Da Proboscis In Hot Demand|date=March 8, 1952|publisher=The Spokesman-Review|accessdate=May 25, 2011}}</ref>

The divorce meant that Skelton had lost his married man's [[Conscription in the United States|deferment]]; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the [[United States Army|army]] in early 1944; both MGM and his radio [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uhtiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qnUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5457,2096932&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Consider Deferment For Film Comedian|date=May 17, 1944|work=The Telegraph-Herald|accessdate= May 25, 2011}}</ref> Skelton's last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, the day before he was formally inducted as a private; Skelton was not assigned to the entertainment corps at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''.<ref name=release/><ref name=private>Hyatt, p. 13</ref>

By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a [[Marriage licence|marriage license]] and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry Skelton, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Skelton's former wife's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career. Edna Skelton stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vMheAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WzIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3537,461014&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red, Muriel Make Ready for Wedding|date=April 8, 1944|work=Lewiston Morning Tribune|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F2pIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6525,5823272&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Skelton Marriage Cancellation Real Mystery|date=April 11, 1944|publisher=The Evening Independent|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

After being assigned to the  entertainment corps, Skelton performed as many as ten to twelve shows per day before troops in both the United States and in Europe. The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]].<ref name=release/> Skelton's nervous collapse while in the army left him with a serious [[stuttering]] problem.  While recovering at an army hospital in Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive.  Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh.  As a result of this effort, Skelton's stuttering problem was cured; his army friend's condition also improved and he was no longer on the critical list.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://archive.org/stream/radiotvmirror00macf#page/n485/mode/2up|title=Laughter For Peter|date=May 1952|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|pages=41, 84|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref> Skelton was [[US Military discharge|released]] from his army duties in September 1945.<ref name=release>Adir, p. 201</ref> His sponsor was eager to have him back on the air, and Skelton's program began anew on NBC on December 4, 1945.<ref name=private/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qhEEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT5&dq=red+skelton#v=onepage&q=red%20skelton&f=false|title=B&W Hopes That Red Skelton May Be Ex-GI By Fall|date=May 5, 1945|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a "loudmouthed braggard"; Cauliflower McPugg, a [[Boxing|boxer]]; Deadeye, a [[cowboy]]; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations.<ref>Hyatt, p. 14</ref> By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose]], who would go on to television with him. Skelton had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.<ref>Hyatt, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>

On April 22, 1947, Skelton was [[Censorship|censored]] by NBC two minutes into his radio show. When he and his announcer Rod O'Connor began talking about [[Fred Allen]] being censored during his NBC show the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds. Comedian [[Bob Hope]] was also given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen.{{#tag:ref|Fred Allen was censored when he referred to an imaginary NBC vice-president who was "in charge of program ends".  He went on to explain to his audience that this vice-president saved these hours, minutes and seconds that radio programs ran over their allotted time until he had two weeks' worth of them and then used the time for a two week vacation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19470422&id=QIstAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ZwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6415,5982328|title=Bob Hope and Red Skelton Join Fred Allen as 'Silent Stars'|date=April 22, 1947|publisher=Reading Eagle|accessdate=March 8, 2014}}</ref>|name=Allen|group=note}} Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience's benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. Skelton's words after he was back on the air were, "Well, we have now joined the parade of stars." He had been briefly censored the previous month for the use of the word "diaper". After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer pull the plug for similar reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qttXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=h_UDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6530,3671979&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=NBC Also Stills Skelton and Hope on Radio Ribbing|date=April 23, 1947|publisher=Spokane Daily Chronicle|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SNBTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vjgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4086,4071784&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=NBC Drops Ban on Radio Jibes|date=April 24, 1947|work=The Leader-Post|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>

Skelton changed sponsors in 1948; [[Brown and Williamson]], owners of Raleigh cigarettes, withdrew due to program production costs.

The script was completed and Skelton had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls.  The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking.  When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall.  Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall.  Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Colliers-1952mar29-00026|title=Helter Skelton|date=March 29, 1952|publisher=Collier's|pages=26<U+2013>27|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>

In 1969, Skelton performed a self-written monologue about the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. In the speech, he commented on the meaning of each phrase of the pledge. Skelton credited one of his Vincennes grammar school teachers, Mr. Laswell, with the original speech. The teacher had grown tired of hearing his students monotonously recite the pledge each morning; he then demonstrated to them how it should be recited, along with comments about the meaning behind each phrase.<ref name=legend/>  CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monologue as a [[Single (music)|single]] on [[Columbia Records]].<ref>Hyatt, pp. 112<U+2013>113</ref> A year later, Skelton performed the monologue for President [[Richard M.

===Off the air and bitterness===
As the 1970s began, the networks began a major campaign to discontinue long-running shows that were considered stale or lacking youth appeal. Despite Red Skelton's continued strong ratings, CBS saw his show as fitting into this category and canceled the program along with other comedy and variety shows hosted by veterans such as [[Jackie Gleason]] and [[Ed Sullivan]].{{#tag:ref|See [[rural purge]] for more information on this topic.|name=ruralpurge|group=note}}<ref name="Gehring, preface, xv"/><ref name=TV3>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_6ZWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wEENAAAAIBAJ&pg=5774,3976794&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=TV in Review|author=DuBrow, Rick|date=February 20, 1970|publisher=The News-Dispatch|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> Performing in Las Vegas when he got the news of his CBS cancellation, Skelton said, "My heart has been broken."<ref name=NYTObit/> His program had been one of the top ten highest rated shows for 17 of the 20 years he was on television.<ref name=academy>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-09-22/entertainment/ca-8535_1_red-skelton|title=TV Academy Honors The Genius Of Red Skelton|date=September 22, 1986|author=Christon, Lawrence|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref> Skelton moved to NBC in 1970 in a half-hour Monday night version of his former show.<ref name=TV/> Its cancellation after one season ended his television career, and Skelton returned to live performances.<ref>Hyatt, p.139</ref> In an effort to prove the networks wrong, he gave many of these at colleges and proved popular with the audience.<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=Recluse/>

===Skelton onstage===
While Skelton had a 45-year career on radio and television, he had begun his career as a stage performer.

Though Skelton had always done live engagements at Nevada hotels and appearances such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after he was no longer on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year.<ref name=redblue/> He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls.<ref name=academy/>  Before the show, Skelton's audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites.

===Artwork===
[[File:Red Skelton with artwork 1948.jpg|thumb|left|Skelton at home with one of his clown paintings in 1948.]]
Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago [[department store]] that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one which Skelton described as "a bunch of blotches", he was told, "Ten thousand wouldn't buy that one." Skelton said he told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded Skelton to have his first public [[Art exhibition|showing]] of his work in 1964 at the Sands hotel in Las Vegas where he was performing at the time.<ref>Gehring, pp.280<U+2013>282</ref><ref name=Art>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=owwdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AZcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7263,4009494&dq=red+skelton&hl=en|title=Red Skelton's Paintings Exhibited At Las Vegas|author=Gavin, Mike|date=June 21, 1964|publisher=Park City Daily News|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> He believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.<ref name=classic>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19640301&id=251IAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mgoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=572,180807|title=One Classic Clown Befriends Another|author=Hopper, Hedda|date=March 1, 1964|publisher=The News and Courier|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>

Skelton's first major post-television recognition came in 1978, when the [[Golden Globe Awards]] named him as the recipient for their [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]], which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment.  Skelton's excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19780127&id=N_srAAAAIBAJ&sjid=98YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3216,4704056|title=Director Herbert Ross Sweeps Movie Categories|date=January 27, 1978|work=Times Daily|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}</ref> When he was presented with the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation.

==Legacy and tributes==
Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comedian: "A comedian goes out and hits people right on.  A clown uses pathos.  He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like."<ref name=circusclown>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&dat=19740730&id=7AgvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wNoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2778,3650439|title=Red Skelton Kicked Off His Career With Circus|date=July 30, 1974|work=Beaver County Times|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref> "I just want to be known as a clown," he said, "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything<U+2014>sing, dance and above all, make people laugh."<ref name=NYTObit/><ref name=fame>{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/red-skelton/|title=Red Skelton-Hollywood Walk of Fame|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref>  His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.<ref name=Life/>

In ''Groucho and Me'', [[Groucho Marx]] called Skelton "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and "the logical successor to [Charlie] Chaplin", largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. "With one prop, a soft battered hat," Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." He added that Skelton also "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors."<ref name="Gehring, preface, xv">Gehring, preface, xv</ref><ref>Groucho Marx, pp.136<U+2013>7.</ref> In late 1965 ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]], reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. "It's all so very different today.  The whole business of comedy has changed&nbsp;<U+2014> from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from [[Charley Chase]] to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton." <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newpapers%20Disk2/Utica%20NY%20Daily%20Observer/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20pdf/Utica%20NY%20Observer%201965%20a%20-%204266.PDF#xml=http://www.fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=ffffffff8bdbc9e4&DocId=2183107&Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20U%2dF%2dP&HitCount=6&hits=18+19+28+29+327+328+&SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&.pdf|title=You Can Go Back to Allen's Alley Sunday Night|date=November 12, 1965|publisher=Utica Observer-Dispatch|accessdate=October 30, 2013}} ([[PDF]])</ref> [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] also praised Skelton, saying, "He's a clown in the old tradition. He doesn't need punch lines. He's got heart."<ref name=academy/>
