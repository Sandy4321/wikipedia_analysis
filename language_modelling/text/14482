'''''Mighty Servant 1''''' is a 29,000-ton [[heavy-lift ship]] capable of carrying very large vessels and [[Oil platform|offshore platforms]].

==History==
The ''Mighty Servant 1'' was built for [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] shipping firm [[Wijsmuller Transport]], which merged in 1993 with [[Dock Express Shipping]] to become [[Breda]]-based offshore heavy lifting group, [[Dockwise|Dockwise Shipping B.V.]]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dockwise.com/page/fleet/fleetdata-3.html| title=Mighty Servant 1| publisher=Dockwise| accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> ''Mighty Servant 1'' carried things such as [[oil rigs]] and [[floating drydock]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2005/August/drydock.htm| title=MSC takes drydock on 13,000 mile commute| author=Trish Hoffman| publisher=Military Sealift Command| accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref>

Originally 40 meters wide, she was increased to 50 meters around 1999 to lift the production rig P36.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Service==
She can carry the heaviest semi-submersible drilling units, harsh-environment deep-water jack-up rigs and large floating production platforms like [[Tension-leg Platform|TLP]]'s, [[Floating Production Unit|FPU]]'s and spars with drafts of up to 14 metres.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dockwise.com/page/heavy-marine-transport.html| title=Heavy Marfine Transport| publisher=Dockwise| accessdate=29 May 2010}}</ref>
