'''''Scooby-Doo''''' is a 2002 American-Australian [[live action|live-action]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[Hanna-Barbera]] television cartoon series of [[Scooby-Doo|the same name]] about a group of young detectives and their talking dog. The film was directed by [[Raja Gosnell]], produced by Charles Roven and Richard Suckle, and written by [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] and [[Craig Titley]] for [[Warner Bros.]] 

The film stars [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Linda Cardellini]] as [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], and [[Neil Fanning]] as the voice of [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], along with Scott Innes as the voice of a dog named [[Scrappy-Doo]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] as the owner of an island amusement park. Scooby-Doo and the other nonhuman characters were created on-screen using [[computer-generated imagery]].

[[Reggae]] artist [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] and rock group [[MXPX]] perform different versions of the [[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?|theme song]]. Shaggy got his stage name from a previous hairstyle of his he says, not from the character. In 2004, this film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]''. A prequel, ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'', aired on Cartoon Network Sunday, September 13, 2009. A sequel, ''Scooby Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster'', aired on Cartoon Network on Saturday, October 16, 2010. The [[Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster]], a ride based on the film, was built in [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] in Gold Coast, Australia in 2002.

==Plot==
After solving one of their typical madcap cases, the members of Mystery Inc. argue over Fred's taking credit for Velma's plan, and the group breaks up. [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] becomes a celebrity, [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] a [[martial arts]] expert, and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] a [[NASA]] employee, while [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby]] remain beach bums. Two years later, the sleuths are each invited to the remote [[amusement park]] Spooky Island. After an airplane flight to the island in which Shaggy meets a young woman named Mary Jane (Fisher), they meet the park's owner, Emile Mondavarious (Atkinson), who explains that a spell has been placed upon the visiting students. 

Still refusing to work together, the sleuths investigate. A man named N'Goo Tuana explains that the island's [[demon]]s seek vengeance against Mondavarious for building the theme park, and a demon lures Scooby into the forest. Despite a warning from Voodoo Maestro, Daphne goes to a castle containing a closed-down ride, only to find the rest of the gang, who realize it is the obvious place for mysterious wrongdoing. Daphne finds a [[tetrahedron]]-shaped artifact called the Daemon Ritus, and Velma and Fred discover a classroom with a training video for nonhumans. The sleuths flee when confronted by N'Goo's henchmen, including a masked wrestler named Zarkos.

At the island's hotel, Velma reminisces about [[Scrappy Doo]], a little dog who vowed to take revenge after being kicked out of Mystery Inc. Just then, monstrous demons storm in and capture Fred, Velma, Mondavarious, and most of the guests. Mary Jane calls the [[Coast Guard]] for help, but they do nothing, having already been possessed by demons. The next day, Fred, Velma, Mary Jane and more guests are possessed, and Zarkos captures Daphne and the Daemon Ritus. When Scooby falls down a hole, Shaggy follows him into an underground hideout and finds the Daemon Ritus near a vat full of [[protoplasm]]ic heads containing people's souls. When he pulls Velma, Daphne and Fred out of the vat, they return to their bodies. Daphne and Fred initially get mixed up with each other, but with help from the Daemon Ritus, the sleuths return to their original bodies and find Maestro, who explains that the demons will rule Earth for the next 10,000 years if their leader absorbs a "purely good soul". The pure soul turns out to be Scooby, who is tricked into being a sacrifice by Mondavarious, the plan's mastermind.

Meanwhile, Velma has discovered that the demons explode in sunlight, which is why they need to possess the guests. Finally working together again, Mystery Inc. sets a trap to kill the demons by reflecting sunlight from a skull-shaped [[disco ball]], but it doesn't work. Fred and Velma are captured, and Scooby's protoplasm is extracted from his body leaving it limp and presumeably dead. In desperation, Shaggy attacks Mondavarious as he absorbs the protoplasmic heads, freeing Scooby and revealing Mondavarious to be a robot controlled by Scrappy Doo. Using his newly absorbed protoplasm, Scrappy expands into a giant version of himself, and another madcap battle ensues in which Daphne uses her martial-arts skills to defeat Zarkos, who falls into the hole and lands on the vat.  

When the vat tips over, the protoplasmic heads return to their bodies and Daphne deploys the disco skull, which reflects sunlight streaming down the hole, killing the demons. Shaggy sucks the protoplasm back out of Scrappy, Fred and Daphne share a kiss, and Shaggy finds the real Mondavarious trapped underground. After a public presentation in which Fred finally allows Velma credit for her work, the members of Mystery Inc. do their signature hands-together cheer. Scrappy, N'Goo, and Zarkos are arrested and taken away by coast guard helicopters, and the film ends as Scooby and Shaggy enjoy the 'all you can eat' deal that was used to lure them to the island.

==Development==
The film was originally set to have a much more adult tone, essentially poking fun at the original series, much like ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'' and was set for a PG-13 rating. Shaggy was set to be a stoner, Velma and Daphne had a [[lesbian|side relationship]],<ref>http://www.tvguide.com/news/Lesbian-Secrets-Scooby-41340.aspx</ref> Fred was a [[gangster]] and there were many more marijuana references.<ref>Entertainment Weekly, 636/637 - Jan 25th Issue.

According to Sarah Michelle Gellar, after the cast had signed on there was a change and the film became more family-friendly. Some of the original adult jokes are still in the film and included as deleted scenes on the DVD.<ref>"Sarah Michelle: The Buffy Slayer". Marie Claire, November 2006. Vol. 13, Issue 11. Page 100.</ref> Filmmakers had stated by the week of August 9, 2002 that most of the rumors would not be alluded to in the ''Scooby-Doo'' film as the filmmakers wanted a film that appealed to families.<ref name="Sigesmund"/>

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Scooby-Doo (soundtrack)}}
A soundtrack containing hip hop, reggae and alternative rock was released on June 4, 2002, by [[Atlantic Records]]. It peaked at #24 on the [[Billboard 200]] and #49 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].

== Deleted scenes ==
* This is the first considered opening for the movie where it is in cartoon form before switching to live-action. The group are exploring a graveyard, possibly as part of a mystery. It shows the group showing their personalities in the movie (with Daphne also getting captured, which serves as a running gag in the movie), and running away from past monsters, like the Creeper, the Frankenstein monster, and the Giggling Green Ghost. As it looks like they got away, the Luna Ghost appears and captures Daphne (again) and takes her to the Wow-O Toy Factory. The gang begin forming their plan and it then goes into live-action mode at the start of the movie.
* This is where Fred, Velma and Daphne meet at the airport to go to Spooky Island, where they discuss how their lives have been since they split up. Fred discusses he is now a celebrity and wrote his own book, but a flashback shows he is at a [[fan convention]] and not doing well. Velma reveals she is now working for NASA and is on a journey of self-discovery, where another flashback shows that Velma is in therapy and discusses Mystery, Inc., where it is revealed no one remembers her. Then it is Daphne's turn, and reveals in a flashback that she has been taking martial arts classes so she cannot get kidnapped. Of course, she fails and gets caught in a tree branch, and her sensei speaks in Chinese that she is hopeless.
* According to the director, this scene was used to introduce Spooky Island as part of a tour. Shaggy and Scooby are with Mary Jane, who is Shaggy's love interest in the movie. Velma also meets the man she meets at the bar later in the movie. It also shows Daphne following the voodoo man who acquired the chicken he tired to use in his voodoo ritual, and Fred looking around, seeing weird footprints that lead him to the castle, which he mentions later at the castle. The audience also sees two climbers climbing a wall with amazing speed. This also introduces an earlier introduction to the demons.
* This takes place after Velma discusses with the man she meets at the bar about her old life with Mystery Inc. and she believes she is drunk, and she gets on the piano N'Goo Tauna is playing and sings "You're Just Too Good to be True", which works. However, Emile Mondavarious, who is sitting with Shaggy and Mary Jane, points out the drinks are non-alcoholic. And that is when Scooby notices the monster through the window.
* This takes place after Shaggy and Scooby find Fred and before Daphne is captured, where Daphne comes into the locker room and finds Velma dancing with other girls. When Daphne asks Velma what happened when she got kidnapped, Daphne reveals she (Velma) is possessed by the creatures and screams like the creatures, where the rest of the possessed girls chase Daphne out of the locker room, who locks them in and starts to run away.
* This takes place after Shaggy jumps in the hole to save Scooby, and witnesses Daphne kidnapped. Zarkos the wrestler uses the pincer that they use to remove people's protoplasm, and brings out Daphne's protoplasm, which she calls her spirit thingy, and puts in the vat with the other protoplasm. One of the creatures emerge and enters Daphne's body, who uses it and walks away. Then Shaggy walks to the protoplasm vat after everyone leaves.
* This is where Scooby is still imprisoned. In order to escape, Scooby tries to fake a heart attack, but one of the guards claims it didn't work the first 12 times Scooby faked heart attacks either.

==Video games==
A video game based upon the film was released for [[Game Boy Advance]] shortly before the film was released. The game is played in 3rd person point-of-view and has multiple puzzle games and mini-games. The game's structure was similar to a board game. The game was panned by critics and was a poor seller.

==Novelization==
Scholastic Inc. released a novelization of the story in conjunction with the film. The novel was written by American [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] author [[Suzanne Weyn]].
