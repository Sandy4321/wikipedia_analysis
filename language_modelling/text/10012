'''William Buelow Gould''' (1801{{#tag:ref|'''Date of birth:''' the date of birth of 1801 given in this article is based on information given in the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography''.<ref name="adb-wbg"/> There is some discrepancy from sources about whether his DOB was instead 1803. As of 30 December, 2010 the [[State Library of Tasmania]] lists fifty-nine entries for Gould under the 1801 DOB and two entries under the 1803 DOB.<ref name="slt-cat">{{cite web|title=Search results: william buelow gould|url=http://catalogue.statelibrary.tas.gov.au/find/?q=william+buelow+gould|work=Library catalogue|publisher=[[State Library of Tasmania]]|accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref>|name="dob"|group="nb"}} <U+2013> 11 December, 1853) was an [[England|English]] and [[Van Diemen's Land|Van Diemonian]] ([[Tasmania]]n) [[painting|painter]].

Gould's life in Van Diemen's Land was the subject of the award winning [[Historical novel|historical fiction]] novel ''[[Gould's Book of Fish]]''.<ref name="gbof">{{cite book|last=Flanagan|first=Richard|title=Gould's Book of Fish|year=2002|publisher=[[Picador (imprint){{!}}Picador]]|isbn=0-330-36378-6}}</ref>

==Early life==
Gould was born as William Holland<ref name="anh-wbg">{{cite web|title=Gould, William Buelow (1803 - 1853)|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/gould-william-b.html|work=[[Australian National Botanic Gardens]] web portal|publisher=Australian National Herbarium|accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref>  in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], [[England]]. While little is known of his early life, it is thought that he received artistic training under [[Ireland|Irish]] painter [[William Mulready]], [[Royal_Academy#Membership|R.A.]], in [[London]], and [[Germany|German]] [[Lithography|lithographer]] [[Rudolph Ackermann]] in [[Strand, London|The Strand]], and that he worked in [[Spode]]'s factory in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]], as a painter of [[porcelain]].<ref name="adb-wbg"/><ref name="anh-wbg"/>

Gould evidently moved around England quite a bit, and on 7 November, 1826 he was [[Conviction|convicted]] in [[Northampton]], [[East Midlands]], of having by "force of arms stolen one coat", and was subsequently sentenced to "seven years beyond the seas",<ref name="adb-wbg"/> a phrase indicating [[penal transportation|transportation]] to the then British [[penal colony]] of Australia. While the sentence was for the fairly standard term of seven years, as with most convicts, Gould would never return to England. At the time of this conviction, Gould was married and had two children, and had also received a prior conviction for "stealing colours".<ref name="adb-wbg"/>

==Life in Van Diemen's Land==
Gould was transported to Australia aboard the convict ship ''Asia'', arriving in [[Hobart|Hobart Town]], Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), in December 1827.<ref name="adb-wbg"/> During the journey he was known to have painted portraits of the officers.<ref name="anh-wbg"/> Gould was sent to work on the [[brick]]fields, but was soon in trouble again, mainly for [[Misdemeanor|petty offences]] involving theft and drunkenness. In June 1829 Gould was sentenced for [[forgery]] of a [[banknote]] to three years at [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station]]<ref name="adb-wbg"/> on the [[Convicts on the West Coast of Tasmania|west coast]] of Tasmania, one of the most notoriously harsh penal stations in the colonies, generally reserved for only the worst convicts. 

The only access to [[Macquarie Harbour]] from Hobart at the time was by ship around the rugged [[South West Wilderness|south and west coasts]] of Tasmania. During the voyage Gould's [[brig]], the ''Cyprus'', became weather bound in the isolated [[Recherche Bay]] some {{convert|100|km|mi}} south of Hobart, where half the convicts aboard [[Mutiny|mutinied]] and took the ship. Gould was amongst the convicts left [[Marooning|marooned]] along with the officers, and he was one of a party who went overland by foot to seek help. [[Lieutenant governor (Australia)|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|Sir George Arthur]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentences of the convicts who had remained with the officers, and Gould was assigned as a [[Domestic worker|house servant]] to the colonial surgeon Dr James Scott.<ref name="adb-wbg"/><ref name="anh-wbg"/> 

An amateur [[Natural history|naturalist]], Scott put Gould's artistic talents to use, having him paint [[watercolour]]s of [[Flora of Australia|native flora]] regarded even today as being of a high technical standard. Gould however would not remain out of trouble, and was again sentenced to Macquarie Harbour in 1832. Based on his reputation from his time with Scott, Gould was assigned as house servant to another amateur natural historian, Dr William de Little on [[Sarah Island]] at the penal station. Here he continued with his painting, producing highly accomplished [[still life]] watercolours of [[Botany|botanical specimens]], [[bird]]s, [[fish]]es,<ref name="adb-wbg"/><ref name="anh-wbg"/> and other [[Marine biology|sea life]] collected from the surrounding beaches.<ref name="slt-sof">{{cite web|title=<nowiki>[Sketchbook of fishes]  (Sketchbook)</nowiki>|url=http://catalogue.statelibrary.tas.gov.au/item/?id=80818|work=Library catalogue|publisher=[[State Library of Tasmania]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref> His work also included landscape sketches providing important insights into the convict settlement. The Macquarie Harbour settlement was closed in 1833, and along with the other remaining prisoners, Gould was transferred to the [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur Penal Station]]<ref name="adb-wbg"/> on the south-east coast of Tasmania. 

Gould was granted his [[Certificate of freedom]] from Port Arthur on 25 June, 1835, and worked briefly for a [[coachbuilder]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] in the north of Tasmania, before returning to Hobart and marrying Ann Reynolds in 1836. While he continued his mainly still life artwork, the quality of the work became variable, and he descended into a cycle of [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]], [[poverty]], and prison sentences for theft. Gould died of natural causes at his home on [[Macquarie Street, Hobart]] on 11 December, 1853.<ref name="adb-wbg"/><ref name="anh-wbg"/>

==Notable works==
Gould's work is preserved in many [[Art museum|galleries]] around Australia, as well as being held by private collectors. The [[Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery]] in Launceston holds 177 of his botanical works.<ref name=anh-wbg /> A number of works, including a [[self-portrait]], hang in the [[Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery]] in Hobart. His work is also held by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in [[Melbourne]], Entally National House, [[Franklin House|Franklin House, Launceston]], and [[List_of_museums#Australia|Narryna Heritage Museum, Hobart]].<ref name=adb-wbg />

Some notable and representative works include his ''Sketchbook of fishes'' (c1832) (see below),<ref name="slt-sof"/> ''Still life, fruit'' (1832),<ref name="slt-slf">{{cite web|title=<nowiki>[Still life, fruit] / W.

===''Sketchbook of fishes''===
It was around 1832, at [[Macquarie Harbour Penal Station]], that Gould produced his noted ''Sketchbook of fishes'', also known as ''Gould's sketchbook of fishes'', ''Gould's book of fish'', or ''Sketchbook of Fishes in Macquarie Harbour''. This sketchbook consisted of thirty-six separate watercolour-on-paper sketches measuring {{convert|185|mm|in}} x {{convert|227|mm|in}} each. While only six of these works are signed by the author, and none are dated, all works are attributed to Gould. The sketchbook includes a numbered list of the fish, with common names written in pencil by G. T. Stilwell, and species names in pencil by A. M. Olsen, who is thought to have formally identified the fish. The original sketchbook with leather binding and marbled board covers is now held by the [[State Library of Tasmania#Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts|Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts]], in the [[State Library of Tasmania]]; due to its age and condition it is not available for general access, however a digital version is available on the internet.<ref name="slt-sof"/><ref name="nla-sof">{{cite web|title=<nowiki>[Sketchbook of fishes]</nowiki>|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/38368452?q=william+buelow+gould&c=picture|work=Trove Australia|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>

This work was made famous in recent times by Tasmanian author [[Richard Flanagan|Richard Flanagan's]] critically acclaimed and [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] winning 2001 novel ''[[Gould's Book of Fish|Gould's Book of Fish: A Novel in Twelve Fish]]''. This book is a [[Historical novel|fictionalised]] account of Gould's life in Van Diemen's Land, focussing on his time at Macquarie Harbour and his work on the ''Sketchbook of fishes''. The book includes a reproduction of Gould's [[Weedy sea dragon]] painting on the cover (although the actual image used varies depending on the edition), and other works from the sketchbook as the twelve chapter [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]].<ref name="gbof"/> The blurb on the back cover starts with:
<blockquote>''Once upon a time, when the earth was still young, before the fish in the sea and all the living things on land began to be destroyed, a man named William Buelow Gould was sentenced to life imprisonment at the most feared penal colony in the British Empire, and there ordered to paint a book of fish.''<ref name="gbof"/></blockquote>

Another Tasmanian author, [[Richard Davey]], also uses Gould's Weedy sea dragon painting from the ''Sketchbook of fishes'' on the cover of his 2002 book, ''The Sarah Island Conspiracies'',<ref name="rd-sic">{{cite book|last=Davey|first=Richard|title=The Sarah Island conspiracies: being an account of twelve voyages made by one G.K. to Macquarie Harbour on the western coast of Van Diemens Land 1822-1833|year=2002|publisher=[[Round Earth Theatre Company|Round Earth Co]]|isbn=0975005103}}</ref> as does the ''Tasmanian Historical Studies'' issue dedicated to ''Tasmanian Creativity and Innovation''.<ref name="ths">{{cite journal|journal=Tasmanian Historical Studies|year=2003|volume=8|issue=2}}</ref>
