'''''Banksia grossa''''', commonly known as the '''coarse banksia''', is a species of shrub in the [[plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteaceae]] endemic to [[Southwest Australia]]. It is one of fourteen species of [[banksia]] of the [[Series (botany)|series]] ''[[Banksia ser. Abietinae|Abietinae]]'', all of which bear predominantly round or oval [[inflorescence]]s. Collected in 1965, it was [[Species description|described]] in 1981 by [[Alex George]]. Its thick leaves and large seeds distinguish it from other members of the ''Abietinae'', and are the basis of its species name. 

Found in sand or sand over [[laterite]] among [[heath]] between [[Eneabba, Western Australia|Eneabba]] and [[Badgingarra, Western Australia|Badgingarra]] in [[Western Australia]], it grows as a many-stemmed shrub to 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) high with narrow leaves and oval brownish flower spikes up to 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) high, composed of hundreds of individual flowers. Flowering occurs throughout the cooler months of March to September. Old flower spikes develop woody [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]] which bear the seeds. After bushfire, ''Banksia grossa'' regenerates from its woody [[lignotuber]]; bushfires also stimulate the release of seeds, which [[germinate]] after [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]. Visitors to (and likely pollinators of) inflorescences include insects and a nocturnal mammal, the [[white-tailed dunnart]].

Flowers occur in a typical ''Banksia'' flower spike: an [[inflorescence]] made up of hundreds of small individual flowers, or florets, densely packed around (and completely obscuring) a woody cylindrical axis. In ''B.&nbsp;grossa'', this axis is 5 to 7&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;in) high with a diameter of 0.7<U+2013>0.9&nbsp;cm (0.3<U+2013>0.4&nbsp;in). From this, the florets radiate out laterally, giving the inflorescence a diameter of 8 or 9&nbsp;cm (3.2<U+2013>3.5&nbsp;in).<ref name="George 1981"/> Flowers are rusty brown to golden brown, and consist of a hairy 3.4<U+2013>4.5&nbsp;cm (1.5<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;in) long tubular [[perianth]] which opens at maturity ([[anthesis]]) to release the dark red to purple [[style (botany)|style]].<ref name="George 1999"/> 3.8<U+2013>4.8&nbsp;cm (1.6<U+2013>1.9&nbsp;in) long, the style extends past the perianth and is curved at the tip. The flower spikes arise from short thick branchlets running off larger stems, though some flower spikes are terminal (located at the ends of branches and more prominently displayed in the foliage).<ref name="George 1981"/>

Flowering occurs between March and September,<ref name="Markey 1996"/> though early flowering in December has been recorded.<ref name="Taylor 1988"/> It takes five to eight weeks for a flower to develop from bud to the end of flowering. About three weeks before the flowers open, they develop a strong musky smell. The opening of flowers occurs sequentially, starting at the bottom of the inflorescence and sweeping through to the top over a period of around two weeks. At anthesis the flowers produce copious quantities of [[nectar]]; indeed, some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.<ref name="Markey 1996">{{cite conference | first1 = Adrienne S. | last1 = Markey | last2 = Lamont | first2 = Byron B. | authorlink2=Byron Lamont | year = 1996 | title = Why do Some Banksias Have Green Nectar? | booktitle = International Symposium on the Biology of Proteaceae | location = Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne}}</ref> After flowering, the old florets wither and curl against the spike, giving it a hairy appearance. Now known as an [[infructescence]], it is roughly ellipsoidal, 6 to 10&nbsp;cm high (2.2<U+2013>4&nbsp;in) and 4 to 8&nbsp;cm (1.6<U+2013>3.2&nbsp;in) wide. Up to 25 smooth, elliptical [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]]s develop on the spike, each containing up to two wide wedge-shaped [[Glossary of botanical terms#W|wing]]ed seeds.<ref name="George 1999"/> One field study revealed, on average, eight follicles for each fertile cone.<ref name="enright89"/> Initially covered in fine fur, these are 2 to 4.5&nbsp;cm (0.8<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;in) long, 1<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.7&nbsp;in) high and jut out by 1<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.7&nbsp;in).<ref name="George 1981"/> The fur rubs off and they become smooth with wear, and generally remain closed until opened by fire.<ref name="George 1981"/>

The seeds of ''Banksia grossa'' are the largest of all the species of the series ''Abietinae''. Measuring 2.8<U+2013>3.9&nbsp;cm (1.1<U+2013>1.5&nbsp;in) long, they are made up of a cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body, 1.4<U+2013>1.8&nbsp;cm (0.6<U+2013>0.7&nbsp;in) long by 0.4<U+2013>0.9&nbsp;cm (0.2<U+2013>0.4&nbsp;in) wide, and a 2.7<U+2013>3.3&nbsp;cm (1.1<U+2013>1.3&nbsp;in) wide wing. The [[seed separator|woody separator]] is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it.<ref name="George 1981"/><!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> The bright green [[cotyledon]]s are [[wikt:obovate|obovate]] and can be either convex or concave, measuring 1.6 to 2.2&nbsp;cm long by 0.9 to 1.2&nbsp;cm wide. These arise from a stocky seedling stem, known as the [[hypocotyl]], which is reddish and covered in short hairs. The [[auricle (botany)|auricle]]s of the cotyledons are 2&nbsp;mm long. Seedling leaves arise 0.6 to 0.8&nbsp;cm beyond the cotyledons and are oppositely arranged. Linear, they are 1.4 to 1.6&nbsp;cm long with recurved margins and are covered in white hair. The stem remains reddish. Subsequent leaf pairs are successively longer.<ref name="George 1981"/>

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimen collection of ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' was made by botanist [[Fred Humphreys|Fred W. Humphreys]] in 1965. [[Alex George]] has expressed surprise that it was not collected by earlier visitors to the area, speculating that "perhaps they were diverted by its similarity to ''[[Banksia leptophylla|B.&nbsp;leptophylla]]'' and ''[[Banksia sphaerocarpa|B.&nbsp;sphaerocarpa]]''." George formally described the species in his 1981 monograph "[[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)|The genus ''Banksia'' L.f. (Proteaceae)]]", based on a specimen collected by him on the [[Brand Highway]], 76&nbsp;km north of [[Regans Ford, Western Australia|Regans Ford]], on 14 May 1969. He placed it in subgenus [[Banksia subg. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because of its flower spike; section ''[[Banksia sect. Oncostylis|Oncostylis]]'' because its styles are hooked; and the resurrected series ''Abietinae'', which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. It was placed in [[phyletic order]] between ''[[Banksia micrantha|B.&nbsp;micrantha]]'' and ''B.&nbsp;leptophylla''. The specific epithet is from the [[Latin]] ''grossus'' ("coarse") and refers to the leaves, flowers and fruit, all of which George observed were more coarse than other members of ''B.''&nbsp;ser. ''Abietinae''.<ref name="George 1981"/>

George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges published [[Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|an arrangement]] informed by a [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. ''Banksia'' ser. ''Abietinae'' was found to be very nearly [[monophyly|monophyletic]], and so was retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four [[subseries]]. ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' appeared as the most basal member of the second of these:

}}

This clade became the basis for the new subseries [[Banksia subser. Sphaerocarpae|''Sphaerocarpae'']], which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in ''B.&nbsp;micrantha''), and "transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face". The species other than ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' also have shouldered follicles.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | last1 = Thiele | first1 = Kevin | authorlink1=Kevin Thiele | last2 = Ladiges | first2 = Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A Cladistic Analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref>

Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of ''Banksia'' for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' series of monographs. ''B.&nbsp;grossa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s placement was the same as in 1981, except that ''[[Banksia telmatiaea|B.&nbsp;telmatiaea]]'' was moved to set between it and ''B.&nbsp;leptophylla''.

Since 1998, [[Austin Mast]] has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Banksiinae]]. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' was inferred to be sister to a [[polytomous]] clade consisting of ''B.&nbsp;leptophylla'', ''B.&nbsp;telmatiaea'', ''B.&nbsp;scabrella'' and ''B.&nbsp;lanata'':<ref name="Mast 1998">{{cite journal | last = Mast | first = Austin R. | authorlink = Austin Mast | year = 1998 | title = Molecular Systematics of Subtribe Banksiinae (''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra''; Proteaceae) Based on cpDNA and nrDNA Sequence Data: Implications for Taxonomy and Biogeography | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | volume = 11 | pages = 321<U+2013>342 | doi = 10.1071/SB97026 | issue = 4}}</ref><ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | last1 = Mast | first1 = Austin R.| last2 = Givnish | first2 = Thomas J.  | year = 2002 | title = Historical Biogeography and the Origin of Stomatal Distributions in ''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra'' (Proteaceae) Based on Their cpDNA Phylogeny | journal = [[American Journal of Botany]] | volume = 89 | issue = 8 | pages = 1311<U+2013>23 | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/89/8/1311 | doi = 10.3732/ajb.89.8.1311 | issn = 0002-9122 | pmid=21665734}}</ref><ref name="Mast 2005">{{cite journal | last1 = Mast | first1 = Austin R. | last2 = Jones | first2 = Eric H. | last3 = Havery | first3 = Shawn P. | year = 2005 | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | title = An Assessment of Old and New DNA Sequence Evidence for the Paraphyly of ''Banksia'' with Respect to ''Dryandra'' (Proteaceae) | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | pages = 75<U+2013>88 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Systematic Botany Society | doi = 10.1071/SB04015}}</ref>

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of ''Banksia'' by merging ''[[Dryandra]]'' into it, and publishing [[Banksia subg. Spathulatae|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae'']] for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp;grossa'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae''.<ref name="Mast 2007">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R.; Thiele, Kevin | year = 2007 | title = The Transfer of ''Dryandra'' R.Br. to ''Banksia'' L.f.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksia grossa map.png|thumb|right|Distribution in Western Australia]]
''Banksia grossa'' mainly occurs from west of [[Yandanooka, Western Australia|Yandanooka]] in the north, south to [[Badgingarra National Park]], and east almost to [[Coorow, Western Australia|Coorow]]. It grows in shallow sand over [[laterite]], in deep sand, and occasionally atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among [[kwongan]] [[shrubland]].<ref name="Taylor 1988"/><ref name="George 1999"/> Around 40% of plants occur on [[Road_verge#Rural_roadsides|road verges]].<ref name="Taylor 1988"/>

==Ecology==
''Banksia grossa'' resprouts from its woody lignotuber after bushfire. Shrubs carry relatively low numbers of seeds compared with plant species that regenerate by seed after bushfire. A field study in Eneabba showed shrubs bore anywhere from 30 to 90 seeds per plant. Seeds borne on plants, however, are less likely to be eaten by animals than seed lying dormant in the soil, and hence survive to produce future seedlings. Populations of resprouting plants, like ''B.&nbsp;grossa'', benefit more from longer intervals between fires as their stored [[Soil seed bank|seedbank]] takes longer to accumulate than reseeding species.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bellairs|first1=Sean M.|last2=Bell|first2=David T.|year=1990|title=Canopy<U+2010>borne Seed Store in Three Western Australian Plant Communities|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|volume=15|issue=3|pages=299<U+2013>305|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1990.tb01034.x|issn=1442-9993}}</ref> <!-- cites para --> The follicles generally open after bushfire, releasing seeds which [[germinate]] after [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]].<ref name="enright89">{{cite journal|last1=Enright|first1=Neal J.|last2=Lamont|first2=Byron B.|year=1989|title=Fire temperatures and follicle-opening requirements in 10 Banksia species|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|volume=14|issue=1|pages=107<U+2013>13|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1989.tb01012.x|issn=1442-9993}}</ref> Species with persistent flowers on old spikes often require higher temperatures for follicles to open after burning; laboratory testing resulted in 50% opening after exposure to 270&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and 90% after 400&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref name="enright89"/>

The leaves of ''B. grossa'' are adapted to a dry climate. The lower surfaces are protected by the strongly [[Glossary of botanical terms#revolute|revolute]] shape of the leaf, the leaf margins curling around underneath almost to the mid-vein. The [[trichome]]s (leaf hairs) run along the mid-vein and the margins, further protecting the surface where the [[stoma|stomate]]s are located, thus minimising water loss.<ref name="hill94">{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Robert S.|title=History of the Australian Vegetation: Cretaceous to Recent|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=1994|pages=405<U+2013>06|isbn=0-521-40197-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=loBrTOJDojoC&pg=PA406&dq=history+of+the+australian+vegetation+cretaceous+to+recent+grossa#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20the%20australian%20vegetation%20cretaceous%20to%20recent%20grossa&f=false}}</ref> Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series ''Abietinae'' developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.<ref name="Mast 2002"/>

==Cultivation==
''Banksia grossa'' is cultivated for its attractive needle-like leaves and rusty-brown flower spikes, both of which can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or [[loam]]y acidic soils with a [[Soil pH|pH of 5.5 to 7]], and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.<ref name="Collins 2008">{{cite book | last1 = Collins | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Collins | first2 = Kathy | last3=George | first3=Alex S. | title = Banksias | publisher = Bloomings Books | location = Melbourne, Victoria | year = 2008 | pages = 213<U+2013>14 | isbn = 1-876473-68-1 }}</ref>
