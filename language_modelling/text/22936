Several therapies for [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) exist, although there is no known cure. Multiple sclerosis is a [[chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] [[demyelinating disease]] that affects the [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]] (CNS).

The most common initial course of the disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is characterized by unpredictable attacks ([[relapse]]s) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, many of the people who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a [[diagnosis]] of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS. 

The primary aims of therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used in the management of MS may have several [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]], and many possible therapies are still under investigation. At the same time different [[Alternative medicine|alternative treatments]] are pursued by many patients, despite the paucity of supporting, comparable, replicated scientific study.

This article focuses on therapies for standard MS; [[idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases|borderline forms of MS]] have particular treatments that are excluded.

== Management of acute attacks ==
[[File:Methylprednisolone.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of methylprednisolone. Corticosteroids are used during acute multiple sclerosis relapses.]]

During symptomatic attacks, patients may be hospitalized. As of 2007, administration of high doses of [[intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[corticosteroid]]s, such as [[methylprednisolone]],<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682795.html Methylprednisolone Oral.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2003-04-01).

Retrieved on 2007-09-01.</ref> is the routine therapy for acute relapses. This is administered over a period of three to five days, and has a well-established [[efficacy]] in promoting a better recovery from [[disability]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sellebjerg F, Barnes D, Filippini G, ''et al.'' |title=EFNS guideline on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses: report of an EFNS task force on treatment of multiple sclerosis relapses |journal=Eur.

The aim of this kind of treatment is to end the attack sooner and leave fewer lasting deficits in the patient. Although generally effective in the short term for relieving [[symptom]]s, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to have a significant impact on long-term recovery: steroids produce a rapid improvement from disability, but this improvement only lasts up to thirty days following a clinical attack and is not evident thirty-six months after the attack. This treatment does not reduce the number of patients who subsequently develop a clinical [[relapse]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brusaferri F, Candelise L |title=Steroids for multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials |journal=J.

Recent studies suggest that steroids administered orally are just as effective at treating MS symptoms as intravenous treatment. However, short-term treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids does not seem to be attended by [[adverse drug reaction|adverse effects]], whereas [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms and psychiatric disorders are more common with oral corticosteroids.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Filippini G, Brusaferri F, Sibley WA, ''et al.'' |title=Corticosteroids or ACTH for acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD001331 |year=2000 |pmid=11034713 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001331 |editor1-last=Filippini |editor1-first=Graziella}}</ref>

== Disease-modifying treatments ==
As of 2011, six disease-modifying treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies of different countries, including the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA) and the Japanese [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|PMDA]]. The six drugs are [[interferon beta-1a]] (Avonex, Rebif), [[interferon beta-1b]] (Betaseron), [[glatiramer acetate]] (Copaxone), [[mitoxantrone]] (Novantrone), [[natalizumab]] (Tysabri) and  [[fingolimod]] (Gilenya), the first oral drug available. Most of these drugs are approved only for the Relapsing-Remitting course.

=== Clinically isolated syndrome ===
The earliest clinical presentation of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of [[demyelination]] but the patient does not fulfill the [[McDonald criteria|criteria]] for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<ref name="pmid15847841">{{cite journal |author=Miller D, Barkhof F, Montalban X, Thompson A, Filippi M |title=Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=281<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |pmid=15847841 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70071-5}}</ref> Several studies have shown that treatment with [[interferon]]s during an initial attack can decrease the chance that a patient will develop clinical definite MS.

Even with appropriate use of medication, to varying degrees most patients with relapsing-remitting MS still suffer from some attacks and many suffer subsequent disability.

=== Secondary progressive MS and progressive relapsing MS ===
[[File:Mitoxantrone skeletal.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of mitoxantrone]]

Treatment of advanced forms of MS is more difficult than relapsing-remitting MS. A wide range of medications have been used to try to slow the progression of the disease, with results that have been at best fair.

[[Mitoxantrone]] has shown positive effects in patients with a secondary progressive and progressive relapsing courses. It is moderately effective in reducing the progression of the disease and the frequency of relapses in patients in short-term follow-up.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal |author=Martinelli Boneschi F, Rovaris M, Capra R, Comi G |title=Mitoxantrone for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=4 |pages=CD002127 |year=2005 |pmid=16235298 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002127.pub2 |editor1-last=Martinelli Boneschi |editor1-first=Filippo}}</ref> In 2007 it was the only medication approved in the USA for both secondary progressive and progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis; however, it causes dose-dependent [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]] which limits its long-term use. It is also not approved in Europe.

[[Natalizumab]] or ''Tysabri'' has shown efficacy and has been approved for secondary progressive MS with relapses. It can help the immune system to fight against bacteria.

Interferon-beta-1b (''Betaseron'' or ''Betaferon'') slowed progression of the disease in one clinical trial for secondary progressive MS, but not in another. However, both studies demonstrated that interferon recipients had fewer relapses and less disease activity, as assessed by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI). Therefore, interferons show promise in treating secondary progressive MS, but more data is needed to support their widespread use.<ref name="pmid15182221">{{cite journal |author=McCormack PL, Scott LJ |title=Interferon-beta-1b: a review of its use in relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis |journal=CNS Drugs |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=521<U+2013>46 |year=2004 |pmid=15182221 |doi=}}</ref>

=== Primary progressive MS ===
Treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is problematic as many patients do not respond to any available therapy, and no treatment has been approved specifically for use in this form of the disease. 

Several trials have been designed specifically for PPMS, including trials with [[interferon]]s and [[mitoxantrone]], a phase III trial of [[glatiramer acetate]], and an open-label study of [[riluzole]].<ref>[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696013.html Riluzole.] US National Library of Medicine (Medline) (2003-04-01).

=== Side effects of treatments ===
[[File:Implant.png|right|thumb|Injectable medications can produce irritation or bruises at injection site. The bruise depicted was produced by a subcutaneous injection.]]

Both the [[interferon]]s and [[glatiramer acetate]] are available only in injectable forms, and both can cause irritation at the injection site. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as [[lipoatrophy]], may develop.

[[Glatiramer acetate]] is generally considered to be better tolerated than the interferons, although some patients taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart [[palpitation]]s, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite journal |author=Munari L, Lovati R, Boiko A |title=Therapy with glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD004678 |year=2004 |pmid=14974077 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004678 |editor1-last=Munari |editor1-first=Luca M.}}</ref>

[[Mitoxantrone]] therapy may be associated with immunosuppressive effects and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]; however its most dangerous side effect is its dose-related [[cardiotoxicity|cardiac toxicity]].

== Managing the effects of MS ==
Disease-modifying treatments only reduce the progression rate of the disease but do not stop it. As multiple sclerosis progresses, the symptoms tend to increase. The disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and functional deficits that result in a range of progressive impairments and [[Disability|handicap]]. Management of these deficits is therefore very important. 

Both drug therapy and [[neurorehabilitation]] have shown to ease the burden of some symptoms, even though neither influence disease progression. For other symptoms the efficacy of treatments is still very limited.<ref name="pmid16168933">{{cite journal |author=Kesselring J, Beer S |title=Symptomatic therapy and neurorehabilitation in multiple sclerosis |journal=Lancet neurology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=643<U+2013>52 |year=2005 |pmid=16168933 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(05)70193-9}}</ref>

In regards to physical activity, it is important that the patient remains cautious when their core temperature elevates above normal levels due to the resulting transient increase in symptoms. An elevated core temperature, leading to increased symptom presentation has been noted during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner. Some studies have found other cooling strategies to be beneficial: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure.<ref name="Davis">{{cite journal |author1=Davis, S.L., |author2=Frohman, E.M. |author3=White, A.T. |author3=Wilson, T.E. |title=Thermoregulation in multiple sclerosis |journal=J Appl Physiol |year=2010 |volume=109 |pages=1531<U+2013>1537 }}</ref> Despite the preceding suggestions, the long term benefits from physical activity far outweigh abstaining from activity to reduce the occurrence of these transient effects.<ref name="Petajan">{{cite journal |author1=Petajan, J.H., |author2=White, A.T. |title=Recommendations for physical activity in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Sports Medicine |year=1999 |volume=27 |issue= 3| pages=719-191 }}</ref>

=== Medical treatments for symptoms ===
{{Further2|[[Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms]]}}

Multiple sclerosis can cause a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation ([[hypoesthesia]]), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as [[dysarthria]]) or swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), visual problems ([[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], [[optic neuritis]], or [[diplopia]]), [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and acute or chronic [[pain]] syndromes, [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] and [[bowel]] difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly [[clinical depression|depression]]). The most common clinical measure of disability progression and severity of the symptoms is the [[Expanded Disability Status Scale]] or EDSS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kurtzke JF |title=Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) |journal=Neurology |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1444<U+2013>52 |year=1983 |pmid=6685237 |doi=}}</ref> At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options.

{{Main|Therapies under investigation for multiple sclerosis}}

Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. There are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Some of these treatments involve the combination of drugs that are already in use for multiple sclerosis, such as the joint administration of [[mitoxantrone]] and [[glatiramer acetate]] (''Copaxone'').<ref>[http://www.mxga-mstrial.co.uk/ United Kingdom early Mitoxantrone Copaxone trial.] Onyx Healthcare (2006-01-01).

An MS treatment has been developed containing an extract of sea anemone venom.  The treatment inhibits T-cells - the white blood cells responsible for nerve damage in MS patients.  Ten years into its development, the drug is on the cusp of undergoing clinical trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-int.com/news/sea-anemone-venom-creates-potent-ms-drug.html|title=Sea Anemone Venom Creates Potent MS Drug

== Alternative treatments ==
A recent study found that over 60% of MS patients use [[complementary and alternative medicine]], possibly because conventional treatments lack effectiveness. Except for vitamin D, evidence is lacking for these treatments and there are no clear guidelines for their use.<ref name=pmid18631428/>

The effect of [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] on MS is unclear, with studies unable to show whether diet contributes to MS or can alter its course. Ecologic studies have found a link between high consumptions of [[polyunsaturated fat]]s and low MS prevalence. The most promising evidence comes from daily supplementation with [[vitamin D]]. Evidence is lacking for several other widely promoted non-herbal supplements, including [[vitamin B12]], [[alpha-lipoic acid]], [[luteolin]], and [[evening primrose oil]].<ref name=pmid18631428>{{cite journal |author= Namaka M, Crook A, Doupe A ''et al.'' |title= Examining the evidence: complementary adjunctive therapies for multiple sclerosis |journal= Neurol Res |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=710<U+2013>9 |year=2008 |pmid=18631428 |doi=10.1179/174313208X325038}}</ref> Many diets have been proposed for treating the symptoms of the disease.

[[Herbal medicine]] is another source of alternative treatments. Many patients use [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] to help alleviate symptoms; however, the results of experimental studies are scarce and further clinical trials are required.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chong MS, Wolff K, Wise K, Tanton C, Winstock A, Silber E |title=Cannabis use in patients with multiple sclerosis |journal=Mult.

[[Bee venom therapy]] has been promoted as a possible treatment for MS, as it is thought to be an anti-inflammatory and inflammation is a component of MS. Research results have been variable and its benefit has not been demonstrated. Its greatest safety issue is the risk of [[anaphylactic shock]], as about 15% of the population is allergic to bee stings.<ref name="pmid18631428"/>

[[Hyperbaric oxygenation]] has been the subject of several small studies with heterogeneous results which, overall, do not support its use.<ref name="pmid14974004">{{cite journal |author=Bennett M, Heard R |title=Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for multiple sclerosis |journal=Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online) |volume= |issue=1 |pages=CD003057 |year=2004 |pmid=14974004 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003057.pub2 |editor1-last=Bennett |editor1-first=Michael H}}</ref>
