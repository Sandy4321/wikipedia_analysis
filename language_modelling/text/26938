'''Peter Keaston Reith''' (born 15 July 1950) is a former [[Australia]]n politician and lawyer. He was a Deputy Leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Melbourne]], Reith was educated at [[Brighton Grammar School]] and at [[Monash University]], from which he obtained bachelor's degrees in economics and law. He then practised as a solicitor first in Melbourne and then at [[Cowes, Victoria|Cowes]], a small town on [[Phillip Island (Victoria)|Phillip Island]]. First elected as a Councillor of the [[Shire of Phillip Island]] from 1976, he was Shire President in his last year on the Council in 1981.
Whilst living on Phillip Island Reith was behind the establishment of Newhaven College, an independent school on Phillip Island. He was also  the key proponent for the establishment of the penguin research facility.

==Political life==
He joined the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in 1966. Representing that party, Reith entered the House of Representatives via a [[Flinders by-election, 1982|by-election in December 1982]], caused by the resignation of ex-Treasurer Sir [[Phillip Lynch]]. Although Reith lost the seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]] only three months later at the [[Australian federal election, 1983| March 1983 general election]], he was not out of parliament for long.  He regained the seat in the [[Australian federal election, 1984|December 1984 election]], which saw a substantial swing towards the Liberals (though not enough to win them government), and he continued to hold the seat for the next 17 years.

Except for a few months in 1993, Reith was a [[shadow minister]] without a break from 1987 until 1996. His posts included that of Shadow [[Attorney-General]] in 1988; in this capacity, he led the successful "no" campaign at the [[Australian referendum, 1988|1988 referendum]]. After the  defeat of [[Andrew Peacock]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 federal election]], and Peacock's subsequent resignation from the Liberal leadership, Reith sought the leadership himself, but was defeated by [[John Hewson]], who won 62 votes to 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poliquant.com/major-party-leadership-ballots-since-1966/ |title=Major Party Leadership Ballots since 1966 |accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Immediately thereafter Reith was elected deputy opposition leader and appointed Shadow [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]], a position he held from 1990 to 1993. Along with Hewson, Reith was one of the architects of the Liberal Party's "Fightback" policy, including the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]].  He resigned as Shadow Treasurer after the Liberals were defeated in the [[Australian federal election, 1993|1993 election]]. In addition, he lost the deputy Liberal leadership in the post-election ballot, and was replaced by [[Michael Wooldridge]].

Following the landslide victory of [[John Howard]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], Reith became [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations|Minister for Workplace Relations]]. In that role, he was one of the best-known and most influential members of Howard's cabinet. His responsibilities involved drafting and implementing the government's industrial relations policy, and he is perhaps best known for the significant productivity reforms which followed the 1997/8 waterfront dispute. Reith's handling of the [[1998 Australian waterfront dispute]], in which he openly supported [[Patrick Corporation]] in its contest with the [[Maritime Union of Australia]], led to criticism from unions<ref>http://workers.labor.net.au/136/c_historicalfeature_medal.html</ref> and the Australian Labor Party (ALP).<ref>http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC19980430038</ref> Reith also introduced and implemented reforms to the Commonwealth public service.

In 2000 Reith was embroiled in an investigation over the improper use of a phone card with a bill totalling $50,000 AUD. Reith admitted that about $1,000 of phone calls were attributed to his son's access to the PIN associated with the phone card.<ref>{{cite news |first= Philip |last= Williams |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Just who will pay Peter Reith's $50,000 phone bill? |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s197803.htm |work= PM (Radio National)|publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date= 10 October 2000 |accessdate= 2007-11-27}}</ref> However, Reith didn't admit that $1,000 of unauthorized phone calls by his son should be his responsibility.

<blockquote>PETER REITH: In the nine month period to the 30th of August there were 619 to Malaysia, 448 calls from Singapore, 317 calls to Singapore, 389 calls from various mobile phones, 478 calls from various countries back to Australia - 2,301 calls in total costing $9,100.45. So my immediate reaction was - well, obviously I haven't been using the card and obviously this card has fallen into, you know, the wrong hands as it were and there was an unauthorised use. http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s197803.htm</blockquote>

Howard transferred Reith to the Defence portfolio in 2000. The following year, Reith announced his impending retirement, and did not contest the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]]. Late in the election campaign Reith became embroiled in the "[[children overboard]]" controversy, in which the government made unsubstantiated claims that asylum seekers had thrown children overboard in a ploy to secure passage to Australia. Reith defended his actions. He made public statements about this matter in the documentary series ''[[The Howard Years]]'', which screened in Australia in November and December 2008, in ''Leaky Boat'' in July 2011 and in the 2012 Logie award winning documentary "Go back to where you came from".  Reith was succeeded as [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] MP for Flinders by [[Greg Hunt]] and as Minister of Defence by Senator [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]].

==After politics==

After leaving parliament, Reith had a number of part-time interests, including advising a Sydney government relations firm, Tenix, a major defence supplier and others. From 2003 to 2009 he was an executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (based in London); in this capacity he represented Australia, the Republic of Korea, Egypt and New Zealand. While in London, Reith was also a member of an independent commission that reported to the Cameron Opposition on UK tax reform.

During 2011, after writing a report for the Liberal Party on the 2010 election, Reith challenged [[Alan Stockdale]] (who in the 1990s had been State Treasurer of Victoria) for the presidency of the Liberal Party. In that contest, Reith lost to Stockdale by just one vote: 56 to 57. Liberal leader [[Tony Abbott]] effectively made his vote for Stockdale public, when he was recorded on camera showing his vote to Stockdale.
In 2013 Mr Reith was Chairman of the Victorian Gas Market Review which concluded with the presentation of his report to the Napthine Government.
From 2014 Reith has been writing weekly for the Sydney Morning Herald and is a political commentator Sky AM Agenda and Paul Murray Live also on Sky.
