'''Chronic cerebro-spinal venous insufficiency''' '''(CCSVI)''' is a term used to describe compromised flow of blood in the [[vein]]s draining the [[central nervous system]]. It has been hypothesized to play a role in the cause of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS).<ref name=Khan2010>{{cite journal |author=Khan O, Filippi M, Freedman MS, ''et al.'' |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and multiple sclerosis |journal=Ann.

==Consequences==
Proposed consequences of CCSVI syndrome include intracranial [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], delayed [[perfusion]], reduced drainage of catabolites, increased [[transmural pressure]],<ref name="pmid19289474">{{Cite journal|author=Franceschi C |title=The unsolved puzzle of multiple sclerosis and venous function |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatr |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=358 |date=April 2009|pmid=19289474 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2008.168179 |url=}}</ref> and [[Human iron metabolism|iron]] deposits around the cerebral veins.<ref name="pmid19724286">{{Cite journal|author=Singh AV, Zamboni P |title=Anomalous venous blood flow and iron deposition in multiple sclerosis |journal=J.

==Pathophysiology==
Zamboni and colleagues claimed that in MS patients diagnosed with CCSVI, the azygous and IJV veins are stenotic in around 90% of the cases. Zamboni theorized that malformed blood vessels cause increased deposition of iron in the brain, which in turn triggers [[autoimmunity]] and degeneration of the nerve's [[Myelin|myelin sheath]].<ref name="pmid19724286"/><ref name=pmid20373339/>
===Venous malformations===
Most of the venous problems in MS patients have been reported to be [[Trunk (anatomy)|truncular]] venous malformations, including azygous stenosis, defective jugular valves and jugular vein [[aneurysm]]s. The [[innominate vein]] and [[superior vena cava]] have also been reported to contribute to CCSVI.<ref name="pmid20351665">{{Cite journal|author=Lee AB, Laredo J, Neville R |title=Embryological background of truncular venous malformation in the extracranial venous pathways as the cause of chronic cerebro spinal venous insufficiency |journal=Int Angiol |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=95<U+2013>108 |date=April 2010|pmid=20351665 |doi= |url=http://www.fondazionehilarescere.org/pdf/03-2518-ANGY.pdf}}</ref> A vascular component in MS had been cited previously.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Simka M |title=Blood brain barrier compromise with endothelial inflammation may lead to autoimmune loss of myelin during multiple sclerosis |journal=Curr Neurovasc Res |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=132<U+2013>9 |date=May 2009|pmid=19442163 |doi= 10.2174/156720209788185605|url=}}</ref><ref>Marrie RA, Rudick R, Horwitz R, Cutter G, Tyry T, Campagnolo D, Vollmer T.

Several characteristics of venous diseases make it difficult to include MS in such group.<ref name="Dorne"/> In its current form, CCSVI cannot explain some of the [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] findings in MS. These include risk factors such as [[epstein-barr]] infection, parental ancestry, the day of birth and geographic location.<ref name="Dorne"/><ref name="pmid20695021">{{cite journal |author=Handel AE, Lincoln MR, Ramagopalan SV |title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and multiple sclerosis |journal=Ann.

Venous pathology is commonly associated to [[hypertension]], [[infarct]]s, edema and transient [[ischemia]], and occur more often with age, however they are hardly ever seen in MS and the disease is rare to appear after age 50. Finally, an organ-specific inmune response is not seen in any other kind of venous disease.<ref name="Dorne">{{Cite journal|author=Dorne H, Zaidat OO, Fiorella D, Hirsch J, Prestigiacomo C, Albuquerque F, Tarr RW.|title=Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and the doubtful promise of an endovascular treatment for multiple sclerosis.|journal=J NeuroIntervent Surg |volume=|issue=|pages= |date=October 2010|pmid= |doi=10.1136/jnis.2010.003947 |url= }}</ref>

===Iron deposits===
Iron deposition as a cause of MS received support when a relation between venous pressure and iron depositions in MS patients was found in a [[neuroimaging]] study<ref name="pmid20351671">{{Cite journal|author=Haacke EM, Garbern J, Miao Y, Habib C, Liu M.|title=Iron stores and cerebral veins in MS studied by susceptibility weighted imaging.|journal=Int Angiol |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=149<U+2013>157 |date=April 2010|pmid=20351671 |doi= |url= }}</ref> and criticism as other researchers found normal [[ferritin]] levels in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of MS patients.<ref>{{Cite pmid|20881272}}</ref> Additionally iron deposition occurs in different neurological diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] or [[Parkinson's disease]] that are not associated with CCSVI.<ref name="pmid19060024"/><ref name=pmid20373339/> Evidence linking CCSVI and iron deposition is lacking, and dysregulation of iron [[metabolism]] in MS is more complex than simply iron accumulation in the brain tissue.<ref>{{Cite pmid|20881276}}</ref>

===Genetics===
A small genetic study looked at fifteen MS patients who also had CCSVI. It found 234 specific [[copy number variation]]s in the [[hla|human leucocitar antigen]] focus. Of these, [[GRB2]], [[HSPA1L]] and [[HSPA1A]] were found to be specifically connected to both MS and [[angiogenesis]], [[TAF11]] was connected to both MS and artery passage, and [[HLA-DQA2]] was suggestive of having an implication for angiogenesis as it interacts with [[CD4]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Custom CGH array profiling of copy number variations (CNVs) on chromosome 6p21.32 (HLA locus) in patients with venous malformations associated with multiple sclerosis |author=Ferlini A, Bovolenta M, Neri M, Gualandi F, Balboni A, Yuryev A, Salvi F, Gemmati D, Liboni A, Zamboni P |journal=BMC Med Genet |year=2010  11: 64 |volume=11 |pages=64 |date=2010-04-28 |pmid=20426824 |pmc=2880319 |doi=10.1186/1471-2350-11-64}} (primary source)</ref>

While the initial article on CCSVI claimed that abnormal venous function parameters were not seen on healthy people others have noted that this is not the case.<ref name=pmid20373339/> In the report by Zamboni none of the healthy participants met criteria for a diagnosis of CCSVI while all patients did.<ref name="pmid19060024"/><ref name=pmid20373339/> Such outstanding results have raised suspicions on a possible [[spectrum bias]], which originates on a diagnostic test not being used under clinically significant conditions.<ref name=pmid20373339/> In 2010 further studies of the relationship between CCSVI and MS have had variable results.

==Society and culture==
The hypothesis has generated optimism from people with MS for more effective treatment options.

===Media===
CCSVI has received a lot of attention in all media, scientific literature and internet.<ref name="Dorne"/> People with MS often read extensively on the CCSVI theory and its development on internet sites,<ref name="WebMD_CCSVI_UK">{{cite news| url=http://www.webmd.boots.com/news/20101012/ccsvi-for-ms-in-the-uk?print=true | work=WebMD Health News | title=CCSVI for MS in the UK| date=12 October 2010| author=Tim Locke |publisher=WebMD UK Limited and Boots UK Limited|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref> and a search for "liberation procedure" in Google yielded as of August 2010 more than 2.5 million hits.<ref name="Dorne"/> Internet has also been used to make commercial advertisement of places where stenting for CCSVI is performed.<ref name="Dorne"/>

===Research funding in Canada===
Debate has been heated regarding funding of CCSVI research in Canada. 

In 2009, the [[Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada]] committed to funding research on the connection between CCSVI and MS,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ms-group-to-fund-research-into-liberation-procedure/article1374954/ | title = MS group to fund research into 'liberation procedure'  |last=Picard | first=A |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-05 |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] }}</ref> although later in 2010 it has come under criticism for opposing clinical trials of CCSVI therapy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2010-09-01/article-1716828/MS-Society%26rsquo%3Bs-stand-sparks-resignation/1 | title = MS Society<U+2019>s stand sparks resignation | date=1 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-05 |work=[[The Telegram]] }}</ref> The MS Society of Canada in September 2010 reserved one million dollars toward CCSVI research "when a therapeutic trial is warranted and approved."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/health/TG3929.html | title = MS Society sets aside $1M in case CCSVI patient trial developed and approved | date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-18 |work=[[CBC News]] }}</ref> 

At a political level there have been contradictory positions, with some provinces funding trials, others stating that since therapy is unproven they should wait,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/life/Premiers+jump+treatment/3356742/story.html |work=Calgary Herald |title=Premiers jump the gun on MS treatment |author=Breakenridge R |date=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2010/08/02/pei-ms-treatment-584.html |title=Premiers to debate MS treatment |publisher=CBC News |date=2 August 2010}}</ref> and others urging for a pan-Canadian trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2010/08/16/man-liberation-ms-clinical-trial.html |work=CBC News |agency=Canadian Press |title=MS therapy trial urged by Manitoba minister |date=16 August 2010}}</ref> [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], the federal agency responsible for funding health research, has recommended that Canada Health not fund a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy yet because "There is an overwhelming lack of scientific evidence on the safety and efficacy of the procedure, or even that there is any link between blocked veins and MS." It has suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies.<ref>http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/42382.html</ref> The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and has said that Canada will not fund a clinical trial at this time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/09/01/ms-ccsvi-liberation-aglukkaq.html | work=CBC News | title=Health minister rejects MS therapy trial | date=2 September 2010}}</ref> 

Debate was further fueled by a report in the media that a former researcher in Saskatchewan proposed investigating a link between blood flow to the brain and MS in 1998.<ref name="pmid9824835">{{cite journal |author=Juurlink BH |title=The multiple sclerosis lesion: initiated by a localized hypoperfusion in a central nervous system where mechanisms allowing leukocyte infiltration are readily upregulated? |journal=Med.

==Research directions==
There are further ongoing studies aiming to clarify if there is a relationship between MS and CCSVI using similar methods to Zamboni's initial study. A large ongoing study at Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center has had preliminary results partially conflicting with those of Zamboni: while 62% of MS patients had CCSVI this was also true for 26% of healthy controls and 45% of participants with other neurological disorders.<ref name="N Today">{{Cite news| url=http://www.aan.com/elibrary/neurologytoday/?event=home.showArticle&id=ovid.com:/bib/ovftdb/00132985-201006170-00013| title=New Theory on CCSVI and MS Needs Further Study, Experts Say |last=Laino |first=Charlene |date=17 June 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-17 |work=Neurology Today}}</ref><ref name="Dorne"/> The US and Canadian MS societies have launched seven studies aiming to clarify the relationship between MS and CCSVI.<ref name="Dorne"/>
