'''Saint John Almond''' was born in [[1577]] and [[Ordination|ordained]] in [[1598]].  He was [[martyred]] [[December 5]], [[1612]]. [[Canonization|Canonised]]  in [[1970]],  he is one of the [[Forty Martyrs of England and Wales]].   He was renowned for his debating skills.

===Early years===
John Almond was born about [[1577]]. He passed his childhood at [[Allerton]] near [[Liverpool]], where he was born, and at [[Much Woolton]], [[Lancashire]]. His boyhood and early manhood were spent in [[Ireland]], until he went to the [[English College in Rome]], at the age of twenty. 

===Skilled Debater===
He concluded his term there brilliantly by giving the 'Grand Act' -- a public defence of theses which cover the whole course of philosophy and theology -- and was warmly congratulated by Cardinals [[Caesar Baronius]] and [[Francesco Maria Tarugi]], who presided. 

===Return to England===
He returned to the dangers of [[England]] in [[1602]] as a secular [[priest]] and administered to the faithful there.  He was arrested in [[1608]], and then again in 1612. In [[November]] of that year seven priests had escaped from prison, and this may have sharpened the zeal of the persecutors.  He displayed to the last a great acuteness in argument, and died with the [[Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus|Holy Name]] upon his lips.
