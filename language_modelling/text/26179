Originally from [[Worthington, Ohio]], she dropped out of high school to move to [[Los Angeles]] with her mother after her parents' divorce. While struggling financially, she landed her first role as the title character in the web-based video series ''Rachel's Room'' in 2001. She went on to earn a [[Young Artist Award]] nomination in 2002 with her portrayal of 15-year-old murder victim [[Martha Moxley]] in the television movie ''[[Murder in Greenwich (film)|Murder in Greenwich]]''.

In 2004, Grace was cast as [[Shannon Rutherford]] in the television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', on which she was a main cast member for the first two seasons, winning a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] shared with the [[ensemble cast]]. Leaving the series, Grace was keen to work more prominently in film, having starred opposite [[Tom Welling]] in ''[[The Fog (2005 film)|The Fog]]'' in 2005. She appeared in ''[[Suburban Girl]]'', ''[[The Jane Austen Book Club (film)|The Jane Austen Book Club]]'' (both 2007), and opposite [[Liam Neeson]] as Kim Mills in ''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'' in 2008. She reprised the role in ''[[Taken 2]]'' (2012) and ''Taken'' ''3'' (2014). She played the lead role, [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], in ''[[Malice in Wonderland (2009 film)|Malice in Wonderland]]'', a modern take on [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. Grace reprised the role of Shannon in two more episodes of ''Lost'', including [[The End (Lost)|the series finale]]. In 2013, she appears in the sixth season of ''[[Californication (TV series)|Californication]]''. She portrays Faith, a groupie and a muse to the stars, who captures the eye of Hank Moody played by [[David Duchovny]].
