'''Joseph S. Nye, Jr.''' (born 1937) is the co-founder, along with [[Robert Keohane]], of the [[international relations]] theory [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]] developed in their 1977 book ''[[Power and Interdependence]]''. Together with Keohane, he developed the concepts of [[asymmetrical interdependence|asymmetrical]] and [[complex interdependence]]. They also explored transnational relations and world politics in an edited volume in the 1970s. More recently, he pioneered the theory of [[soft power]]. His notion of "smart power" became popular with the use of this phrase by members of the new Obama Administration in 2009.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joseph-nye/smart-power_b_74725.html] Smart Power, ''The Huffington Post'', November 29, 2007</ref>
Nye is currently University Distinguished Service Professor at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]], and previously served as dean there. He also serves as a Guiding Coalition member for the [[Project on National Security Reform]].
The 2008 TRIP survey of 1700 international relations scholars ranked him as the sixth most influential scholar of the past twenty years, and the most influential on American foreign policy. 

== Biography ==

He graduated [[summa cum laude]] from [[Princeton University]] and, after studying [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] at [[Oxford University]], obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in [[political science]] from Harvard. He attended Morristown Prep (now the [[Morristown-Beard School]]) in [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], [[New Jersey|NJ]] and graduated in 1954.

Nye originally joined the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] faculty in 1964, serving as Director of the Center for International Affairs and as Associate Dean of Arts and Sciences. From 1977-1979, Nye was Deputy to the Undersecretary of State for Security Assistance, Science, and Technology and chaired the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] Group on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. 

Nye also served as [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs]] in the [[Clinton Administration]], and was considered by many to be the preferred choice for [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential campaign]] of [[John Kerry]]. He is widely recognized as one of the foremost liberal thinkers on foreign policy, and is seen by some as the counter to renowned Harvard conservative [[Samuel P. Huntington]].

In 2005, Nye was voted one of the ten most influential scholars of international relations in the USA.[http://mjtier.people.wm.edu/intlpolitics/teaching/surveyreport.pdf]

He is on the Advisory board of the [[USC Center on Public Diplomacy]] as well as on the International Editorial Board of the [[Cambridge Review of International Affairs]], the editorial board of [[Foreign Policy]], the Board of Directors of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the Guiding Coalition of the [[Project on National Security Reform]], and the Board of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]. He has been awarded the Woodrow Wilson Prize by [[Princeton University]] and the Humphrey Prize by the [[American Political Science Association]]. In 2005 he was awarded the Honorary Patronage of the [[University Philosophical Society]] of [[Trinity College Dublin]] and in 2007 he was awarded an honorary degree by [[King's College London]]. President Obama reportedly passed over Nye for the post of Ambassador to Japan - against the urging of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - in favor of a campaign fundraiser. <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/us/politics/16clinton.html?_r=1&em] For Clinton, <U+2019>09 Campaign Is for Her Turf , ''The New York Times'', July 15, 2009</ref>

Nye has published many works in recent years, the most recent being ''Understanding International Conflicts, 7th ed'' (2009), ''The Power Game: A Washington Novel'' (2004), ''[[Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics]]'' (2004), and ''[[The Paradox of American Power]]'' (2002). Nye coined the term [[soft power]] in the late 1980s and it first came into widespread usage following a piece he wrote in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' in the early 1990s. Nye is currently known for writing debate cards.

Nye and his wife, Molly Harding Nye, have three adult sons.[http://ksghome.harvard.edu/~JNye/FullBio.html]
