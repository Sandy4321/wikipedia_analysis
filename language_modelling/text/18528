Captured at the age of 16, al-Zahrani was accused of being "a front line fighter for the Taliban", despite later revisions that stated he had never advanced past the "second line". He was also accused of arranging weapons purchases.<ref name="worth">[[Andy Worthington|Worthington, Andy]], [The Guantanamo Files: The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America's Illegal Prison]], [[Pluto Press]]. ISBN 0745326658 2007</ref>

In 2006, he wrote a letter to his father while in detention, that suggested that two prisoners seemed to be on the verge of death, and that he suspected foul play. Ten days later, he and the two prisoners were all reported dead, ostensibly having hanged themselves with their bedsheets.<ref name=WashingtonPost20080823>

{{wikisource|Unclassified Summary of Evidence for Administrative Review Board in the case of Al Zahrani, Yasser Talal}}

There is no record that Yasser Talal Al Zahrani chose to attend his hearing.  The [[Summary of Evidence (ARB)|Summary of Evidence memo]] prepared for his hearing listed 26 factors favoring his continued detention.<ref name=ArbSummaryOfEvidenceYasserTalalAlZahrani>
[[OARDEC]], [http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/ARB_Round_1_Factors_000099-000196.pdf#24 Unclassified Summary of Evidence for Administrative Review Board in the case of Al Zahrani, Yasser Talal], [[United States Department of Defense]] -- pages 24-26 -- [[September 8]] [[2005]]</ref>

The factors stated:
*That he decided to travel to Afghanistan, instead of finishing high school, in August 2001.
*That he trained at the Taliban's Konduz Center, and at al Qaida's [[al Farouq training camp]].
*That he was a financial courier.
*That he had ties to various senior al Qaida and Taliban leaders.
*That he served as security guard for three months 
*That he was captured, and sent to a prison in [[Mazari Sharif]], and was injured during the [[prison riot at Qali Jangi]] in early November.

==Al Zahrani's age==
[[Bahrain]]i detainee [[Abdulla Majid Al Naimi]] who was released on [[November 8]] [[2005]] said he knew the three dead men, and commented on their deaths on [[June 25]] [[2006]].

Al Naimi said that 
Al Zahrani, was only 16 when he was captured.<ref name=Gulf060625> [http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/06/25/10049187.html Ex-detainee disputes triple suicide report], ''[[Gulf Daily News]]'', [[June 25]] [[2006]]</ref>
According to Al Naimi Al Zahrani should have been treated as a minor.
:"''He was 21 when he died, barely the legal age in most countries, and was merely 16 when he was picked up four and half years ago. His age shows that he is not even supposed to be taken to a police office; he should have been turned over to the underage [juvenile] authorities.''"

==Recent letter to his father==
The [[New York Times]] reported that Al Zahrani's father, Talal Abdallah al-Zahrani, recently received a letter from his son where he seemed to be in good spirits.<ref name=Nyt060612> [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/us/12gitmo.html?pagewanted=print Prisoners' Ruse Is Suspected at Guant<U+00E1>namo], ''[[New York Times]]'', [[June 12]] [[2006]] - [http://www.berkshireeagle.com/headlines/ci_3927062 mirror]</ref>
He said: "''Nothing suggested that he would commit suicide, nothing,''"

Al Zahrani disputed the US report that his son was non-compliant, saying his son had spent his time memorizing the [[Koran]], and had been behaving.<ref name=Nyt060612> [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/us/12gitmo.html?pagewanted=print Prisoners' Ruse Is Suspected at Guant<U+00E1>namo], ''[[New York Times]]'', [[June 12]] [[2006]] - [http://www.berkshireeagle.com/headlines/ci_3927062 mirror]</ref><ref name=HamSpec060617> [http://www.hamiltonspectator.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=hamilton/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1150494611896&call_pageid=1020420665036&col=1112188062620 A short life ends at Guantanamo], ''[[Hamilton Spectator]]'', [[June 17]] [[2006]]</ref>
Al Zahrani said that the reason his son had been in the area of Afghanistan was that he had been working for  Islamic charities.

==Letter of [[June 1]]==
The English language Arab newspaper ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'' reported that a letter a detainee had "...''written ten days before the Pentagon announced three inmates had committed suicide on [[10 June]]'' ..." appears to report that <U+201C>...''Two detainees are on the verge of death<U+2026> perhaps they are dying or have died poisoned.''...<U+201D><ref name=Aawsat> [http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&id=5974 Saudi Arabia: Detainee Letter Exposes Alleged Guantanamo Horrors], ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'', [[August 12]] [[2006]] - [http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/stories/2520796/ mirror]</ref>
Asharq Alawsat asserts that the two detainees on the verge of death were two of the men the USA claimed committed suicide.

Asharq Alawsat reports that the letter was handed by the detainee, to his lawyer, who turned it over to Talal Al Zahrani's father's lawyer.<ref name=Aawsat> [http://aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&id=5974 Saudi Arabia: Detainee Letter Exposes Alleged Guantanamo Horrors], ''[[Asharq Alawsat]]'', [[August 12]] [[2006]] - [http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/stories/2520796/ mirror]</ref>
Asharq Alawsat reports that the detainee's name is being kept confidential, for his safety.  

Guantanamo attorneys must all agree that they must turn over all their notes and other documents before they leave Guantanamo.  They have to report to a secure document center in [[Washington DC]] center in order to review their own notes.  If a detainee authored a letter suggesting Talal Al-Zahrani and the two other men didn't really commit suicide, keeping his identity confidential could not have prevented the DoD from learning his identity.

==Post mortems==

Guantanamo camp authorities conducted [[post mortem]]s on the three dead men, before their bodies were shipped home.<ref name=ArabNews060619> [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=84011&d=19&m=6&y=2006 Yasser<U+2019>s Body Bears Marks of Beating], ''[[Arab News]]'', [[June 19]] [[2006]]</ref>
Al Zahrani's father has called for a second post mortem by neutral, independent pathologists.

Al Zahrani's father claimed that after his own examination of his son's corpse he was convinced he bore the marks of a beating.<ref name=ArabNews060619> [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&section=0&article=84011&d=19&m=6&y=2006 Yasser<U+2019>s Body Bears Marks of Beating], ''[[Arab News]]'', [[June 19]] [[2006]]</ref>
He sees this as confirming his skepticism that Al Zahrani did not commit suicide, but was murdered.

Al Utaybi's family reported that his Saudi post-mortem had found that the DoD had retained Al Utaybi's brain, heart, liver and kidneys.<ref name=GulfNews060621> [http://www.gulfnews.com/region/Saudi_Arabia/10048452.html Vital organs missing from repatriated body: family], ''[[Gulf News]]'', [[June 21]] [[2006]]</ref>

[[Patrice Mangin]], a widely published [[forensic pathologist]], headed the team that volunteered to provide neutral, independent second autopsies for the three dead men.<ref name=YemenTimes> [http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=958&p=front&a=3 Gitmo detainee buried after body cross-examined], ''[[Yemen Times]]'', [[June 25]] [[2005]]</ref>
After their examination of Ahmed's body, he said that it was routine for pathologists to remove some organs that decay rapidly.  However, they had also found that the DoD had retained Ahmed's throat, which his team would need to examine before they offered a definitive conclusion as to how he died.

Mangin asked the DoD to supply his team with Ahmed's throat, and with the bed sheets they claimed had been used to hang the three men.

==Weight reports==
[[File:ISN 093 weigh-ins.jpg|thumb|Fluctuations of the official recorded weigh-ins.]]

The [[Center for the Study of Human Rights]] at the [[University of California (Davis)]] published the official record of Al Zahrani's weigh-in reports.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93>

The normal range of weights for someone of his height would have been between 114 and 153 pounds.
According to the official record his weights were within the normal range prior to the 2005 hunger strike.

His weight dipped significantly below a healthy normal weight during the first months of the hunder strike.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>
Camp authorities had been weighing Al Zahrani approximately once a month, until the hunger strike.
His weight was recorded at 138 pounds and 128 pounds on June 15th and July 18th 2005.  No weight was recorded
in August.  On his next weigh-in, on September 12th, his weight had dropped to 111 pounds.  At this weight his [[Body Mass Index]] would classify him as underweight.  This weigh-in marks weigh-ins approximately once a week.

His weight continued to drop on his next three weigh-ins.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>
On October 11th his weight had dropped to 104 pounds.  Camp authorities started to record his weight almost every day.  Between November 12th and November 14th he went from 104 to 91 pounds.  The record shows daily weigh-ins stabilized at 90 or 91 pounds until December 11th.  His weight varied from 88 pounds to 98 pounds during his daily weigh-in until January 14th, 2006.

His weight dropped to 88 pounds -- his lowest recorded weight, 77 percent of his minimum healthy weight -- on January 9th, 10th and 11th.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/><ref name=UsdaBMI/>  
It jumped to 98 pounds for January 12th and 13th, and dipped again to 89 pounds on January 14th.

Between January 14th and 15th he gained 27 pounds -- increasing his body weight by 29 percent, to 115 pounds, in a single day.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>

His weight was recorded again on the 16th, 17th and 18th, showing a weight gain of 2 or 3 pounds per day -- weighing 123 pounds, within the low end of normal.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/><ref name=UsdaBMI/>  

His weight was next recorded 33 days later, on February 22nd, showing a weight gain of another thirty pounds.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>
At 163 pounds he would be considered overweight.<ref name=UsdaBMI/>

His weight was recorded on March 10th and April 26th, as 166 and 165 pounds.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>

At his next weigh-in, 31 days later on May 27th, his weight had dropped 47 pounds, 39 percent of his body weight.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>
This weigh-in was two weeks prior to the reported date of his death.

Four days later, on May 31st, he was reported to have gained 27 pounds, 23 percent of his body weight.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/>

Camp authorities have not published how much he weighed when he died.<ref name=Weigh-inReportsIsn93/> 

In January 2006 camp authorities introduced a new measure -- captives were strapped into "restraint chairs" during their force-feeding, and for an hour or two afterwards.  They justified the use of the restraint chairs claiming it prevented captives forcing themselves to vomit the nutrient fluid they had been force-fed.

Captives reported that they were deliberately over-fed, so they were left with extremely painful bloating and cramps.  The use of the restraint chair cut the number of hunger strikers to a dozen or less of the most determined -- including Al Zahrani -- who is reported to have continued with the hunger strike until his death -- or shortly before his death.

==NCIS Report==

On [[August 23]] [[2008]] [[Josh White]] writing in the ''Washington Post'' reported 
the paper had received 3,000 pages of documents arising from the NCIS investigation through [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests.<ref name=WashingtonPost20080823/>
He reported that the NCIS report attributed the deaths to lapses on the part of the guards, and to a policy of leniency for the compliant captives.

The report said the deaths were in [[Camp 1 (Guantanamo)|Camp 1]], which has now been closed, a camp for compliant captives, and that the men's bodies were masked by laundry they were allowed to hang up to dry.<ref name=WashingtonPost20080823/>
