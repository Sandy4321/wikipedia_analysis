===Blackwater Training Center===
Blackwater Training Center offers tactics and weapons training to military, government, and law enforcement agencies. Blackwater Training Center also offers several open-enrollment courses periodically throughout the year, from [[hand to hand combat]] (executive course) to [[precision rifle marksmanship]]. They also offer courses in tactical and off road driving.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackwaterusa.com/images/pdf/trackdetails.pdf |title= Blackwater tactical driving track |accessdate=2007-09-28 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher=Blackwater USA}}</ref>

Blackwater's primary training facility, located on {{convert|7000|acre|sqkm|0}} in northeastern North Carolina, comprises several ranges, indoor, outdoor, urban reproductions, a man-made lake, and a driving track in [[Camden County, North Carolina|Camden]] and [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]] counties.  Company literature says  that it is the largest training facility in the country.

That facility has been operational since April 2007 and serves law enforcement agencies throughout the midwest.

In response, Brian Bonfiglio, project manager for Blackwater West, said "There will be no explosives training and no tracer ammunition. Lead bullets don't start fires."

They also set up a "tent city" for evacuees.<ref name='VP_BW_102607'>{{cite news | first=Bill | last=Sizemore | coauthors= | title=Blackwater delivers supplies to wildfire victims in California | date=[[2007-10-26]] | publisher=The Virginian-Pilot | url =http://hamptonroads.com/node/373811 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-30 | language = }}</ref>
