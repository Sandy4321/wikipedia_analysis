'''Gregory Martin Baum''' (born 14th December 1959) is an Australian [[sports journalist]] and [[soccer|football]] writer.

He was born in 
Boronia, Melbourne, Victoria, to Joan and Martin Baum, as the first of 
five children. He attended St Joseph's Primary School, Boronia, and later 
St Joseph's High School, Ferntree Gully, graduating in 1975. He began work 
on the local paper, the Boronia Advertiser, as a politics and sports 
correspondent, in 1976, as well as attending a night-course in journalism 
(which he never completed).

After a number of his articles on the local football competition were 
republished in [[The Sun-Herald]], a major newspaper in Melbourne, he was offered a job by that newspaper. He became a full time sportswriter for the paper, 
and in this time travelled to Europe and India on a number of occasions. 
He also married Jacinta Maria Tobin.

Greg and Jacinta's first son, Nicholas James Baum, was born on the 
31st May 1989, and a week later he was offered a job by Fairfax 
Publications at [[The Age]], the Sun's main rival. In 1990, his long-time 
love, Collingwood Football Club, won their first VFL premiership for 
thirty-two years. The couple had two more children, Joshua Gregory and 
Maximilian Thomas, in the intervening years, before ultimately divorcing 
in 1998.

Greg has continued to write for The Age, where he is now Chief 
Football Reporter, as well as writing for the Guardian of London and 
editing the Australian edition of Wisden. He has received a number of 
awards for his work, from the MCG Trust, the Victorian Boxing Association 
and the Australian Press Association. In 2006, he attended the FIFA World 
Cup, which he names as one of the highlights of his career.
