The '''siege of Amirli''' was a siege of the predominantly [[Iraqi Turkmens|Turkmen]] town of [[Amirli]] in [[Iraq]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) during the [[2014 Iraq conflict]]. The town was besieged by ISIS forces since June 2014, lacking access to food, electricity, and water. Most the residents are Shia Turkmen, who have organized local self-defense militias to fight against ISIS.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite news|url = http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28910674 |title = Iraq conflict: UN warns of possible Amerli 'massacre'|last = |first = |date = |work = BBC |accessdate = August 23, 2014}}</ref> On August 31, the [[Iraqi military]] reportedly broke the siege and entered the town.<ref name="BBC 2" /><ref name="CBS"/>

==Events==
===Siege===
The siege began in June, after [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) forces advanced on [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|Iraqi positions in Northern Iraq]]. They attacked the town, but failed to capture it after townspeople armed with [[AK-47]]s put up resistance. However, ISIS had more powerful weapons compared to the local militia, prompting fears that they will try to storm the town.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://time.com/3169489/amirli-iraq-turkmen/ |title = ISIS Lays Siege to Iraqi Turkmen Village|last = |first = |date = August 24, 2014|work = TIME |accessdate = }}</ref> ISIS forces continued to fire mortars and rockets into the town, and have launched raids against it. 12,000 citizens in Amirli were in danger from being killed by ISIS, dying from thirst or hunger, or being bombed by the [[Iraqi Army]].<ref name="Radio Sawa">{{cite web|title=Iraqi Air force bombs the positions of ISIS|url=http://www.radiosawa.com/content/iraq-kurdish-forces-isis-oil-fields/256821.html|website=Radio Sawa|accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>

The [[United Nations]] expressed concern over the situation in [[Amirli]], and warned about the possibility of ISIS committing a massacre in the town.<ref name=bbc />

===Military efforts===
On 30 August, the [[Iraqi Army]], [[Shia Islam in Iraq|Shi'ite]] militias and [[Peshmerga]] started a campaign to break the siege, after the speaker of [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]], [[Abdul-Mahdi al-Karabalai]], called to move and break the siege by ISIS on the town.<ref name=alghad /> The forces attacked ISIS from three areas, the army attacked from the south of Amirli in Adhaim, the Peshmerga attacked from the north in [[Tuz Khormato]], the militias attacked from the east in [[Kifri]].<ref name=France24>{{cite web|title=The Iraqi army launches a military operation to break the siege of the Turkmen Shi'ite town of Amirli|url=http://www.france24.com/ar/20140830-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%84%D9%8A/|website=France 24|accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref>

On 31 August, the [[United States]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] began humanitarian aid drops, like food, water and medical supplies, to help prevent a potential [[massacre]] against the [[Shi'a]] [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkmen]] minority in [[Amirli]].<ref name="BBC 2">{{cite web|title=Iraqi forces 'reach besieged Amerli'|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29003321|website=BBC|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref> The US also carried out air strikes on ISIS positions around and near Amirli. Iraqi officials stated that they had reached Amirli and broken the siege and that the military was currently fighting to clear the areas around the town.<ref name=CBS>{{cite web|title=Iraqi army breaks ISIS siege of Shi'ite Turkmen town of Amirli|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraqi-army-breaks-isis-siege-of-shiite-turkmen-town-of-amirli/|website=CBS|accessdate=31 August 2014}}</ref>
