"'''Space Seed'''" is an episode of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. It is the 22nd episode of the [[Star Trek: The Original Series (season 1)|first season]] and was first broadcast by [[NBC]] on February 16, 1967. "Space Seed" was written by [[Gene L. Coon]] and [[Carey Wilber]] and directed by [[Marc Daniels]]. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]) and his crew aboard the [[Starfleet]] starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]. In this episode, the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a [[sleeper ship]] holding genetically engineered superpeople from Earth's past. Their leader, [[Khan Noonien Singh]] ([[Ricardo Montalb<U+00E1>n]]), attempts to take control of ''Enterprise''. The episode also guest stars [[Madlyn Rhue]] as Lt.&nbsp;Marla McGivers, who becomes romantically involved with Khan.

Wilbur conceived the general plot for a different series, ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'', which featured humans from [[Ancient Greece]] who were preserved in cryogenic suspension and revived. The script changed numerous times during preproduction as producer [[Bob Justman]] felt that it would be too expensive to film. Eventually Gene L.&nbsp;Coon and series creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] also made alterations. These revisions include the marooning of the criminals at the end of the episode, and the change of the primary villain from a Nordic character to a [[Sikh]]. Roddenberry attempted to claim the primary writing credit for "Space Seed", a request turned down by the [[Writers Guild of America]].

Montalb<U+00E1>n was the casting director's first choice for Khan and described the role as "wonderful".<ref name=gross38 /> Despite being planned as an inexpensive [[bottle episode]], the special sets and shots using starship miniatures caused the episode to go over budget. On first broadcast, the episode held second place in the ratings for the first half-hour with 13.12 million viewers, but during the second half it was pushed into third place. "Space Seed" has been named one of the best episodes of the series by ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', [[IGN]], and other publications. The 1982 film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' serves as a sequel to this episode. Plot elements of the episode and ''The Wrath of Khan'' were also used in the 2013 film ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', and references to it appear in episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''.

==Plot==
On [[stardate]] 3141.9, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] finds the derelict [[SS Botany Bay|SS ''Botany Bay'']] floating in space. ''Botany Bay'' was launched from Earth in the 1990s. A landing party comprising Captain [[James T. Kirk]] ([[William Shatner]]), Doctor [[Leonard McCoy]] ([[DeForest Kelley]]), Chief Engineer [[Montgomery Scott]] ([[James Doohan]]), and historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers ([[Madlyn Rhue]]) [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beams]] over to the freighter. The landing party finds a cargo of 84 humans, 72 of whom are alive in [[suspended animation]] after nearly 200&nbsp;years. McGivers identifies the group's leader. The occupant begins to revive, but Kirk brings him to ''Enterprise'' for a medical examination when his chamber fails.

Kirk has ''Botany Bay'' taken in tow by a [[tractor beam]], and ''Enterprise'' sets course for Starbase&nbsp;12. In sickbay, the group's leader awakens and attacks McCoy but, impressed by McCoy's bravery, releases the doctor and introduces himself as "Khan" ([[Ricardo Montalb<U+00E1>n]]). Lt.&nbsp;McGivers marvels over Khan, a living relic from the 20th-century, her field of interest. First Officer [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) discovers that their guest is [[Khan Noonien Singh]] who, along with his people, are products of 20th-century genetic engineering designed to create perfect humans. The genetic superhumans instead became warlords and conquered more than a third of the planet, sparking the Eugenics Wars, Earth's last major global conflict. Between eighty and ninety of the superhumans warriors were unaccounted for at the end of the war; Khan is listed as the most dangerous.

Khan is placed under guard in quarters. McGivers is sent to brief him on current events. Taking advantage of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over ''Enterprise''. Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to ''Botany Bay'', where he revives the rest of his superpeople. They return to ''Enterprise'' and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy ''Enterprise'', but Kirk confronts him and a brawl ensues. Though outmatched by Khan's superior strength, Kirk uses a tool as a club to knock the superman unconscious.

Kirk holds a hearing to decide the fate of Khan and his followers. The captain decides that they should be exiled to [[Ceti Alpha&nbsp;V]], a harsh world that Kirk believes would be a perfect place for Khan to start his kingdom. Khan claims he is up to the challenge of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.&nbsp;McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that it would be interesting to see what Khan makes of Ceti Alpha&nbsp;V in 100&nbsp;years.

===Writing===
[[File:Gene roddenberry 1976.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Writers Guild of America denied permission for Gene Roddenberry to get a writing credit on the script for "Space Seed".]]
[[Carey Wilber]] was hired to write a script for an episode of ''Star Trek''. His idea was based on an episode he wrote for the television series ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'' (1949<U+2013>1955). His work on that show featured [[Ancient Greece|Ancient-Greek-era]] humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For "Space Seed", Wilbur replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering.<ref>[[#grossaltman1993|Gross & Altman (1993)]]: p. 37</ref> Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series ''[[Harbormaster (TV series)|Harbormaster]]''. His science fiction extended beyond ''Star Trek'': he also wrote scripts for ''[[Lost in Space]]'' and ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' around the same time.<ref name=gross38/><ref name=cushman445>[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 445</ref>

In Wilber's first proposal for the story that became "Space Seed", dated August 29, 1966<U+2014>shortly before the first episode of ''Star Trek'' aired<ref name=startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed1 /><U+2014>the villain was Harold Erickson, an ordinary criminal exiled into space. He sought to free his gang from ''Botany Bay'', seize ''Enterprise'', and become a pirate.<ref name=cushman445/> Parts of the story were inspired by the use of [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in the 18th century, and characterizations were based on descriptions from the series' [[writer's bible]]. As a result, several elements of the draft proposal differed from how the characters behaved in the actual series<U+2014>for example, the draft includes a scene where Spock defeats Kirk at chess by cheating.<ref name=startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed1 /> Producer [[Gene L.&nbsp;Coon]] told Wilber that his work was the best outline he had seen during his time on ''Star Trek''. Fellow producer [[Bob Justman]] was less enthusiastic; he compared it negatively to ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' and ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', and felt the concept would be too expensive to film. There were also concerns that an unsolicited script submitted by science fiction author [[Philip Jos<U+00E9> Farmer]] resembled the proposed plot which, as Roddenberry had corresponded with Farmer, might lead to litigation.<ref name=cushman445/>

NBC executives reviewed the plot for "Space Seed" and approved it, but Justman reassessed the outline, saying that it needed to be heavily revised.<ref name=cushman447>[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 447</ref> In September, Wilber was given a list of suggested changes including asking him to remove any mention of the setting, as the producers did not want to say how far in the future ''Star Trek'' was set, and to remove the chess scene.<ref name="startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed1">{{cite web|last1=Jose|first1=Maria|last2=Tenuto|first2=John|date=July 16, 2013|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/khan-was-almost-harald-ericsson|title=Khan Was Almost...

The name Govin Bahadur Singh was suggested by the DeForest Research company, who checked scripts for potential errors on behalf of the production company; the Singh name was suggested in part because it was closer to actual Sikh names. Coon and Roddenberry settled on Khan Noonien Singh; Roddenberry had an old Chinese friend named Noonien Wang that he had lost touch with, and hoped that Wang would see the episode and contact him.<ref name=startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed4 /> In the final draft, Roddenberry listed himself as the primary writer, Coon as co-writer and Wilber was absent, but the [[Writers Guild of America]] turned down Roddenberry's request to be credited; Coon received the main credit; Wilber was given co-writer and "story-by" credits.<ref name=cushman449/> Wilber did not often watch his own work, and nearly thirty years later had never seen "Space Seed".<ref name=gross38/> Coon was later credited as Lee Cronin for his part in production of the script.<ref>[[#solowjustman1996|Solow & Justman (1996)]]: p. 139</ref>

===Casting===
[[File:Madlyn Rhue 1961.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Madlyn Rhue ''(pictured in 1961)'' was cast as Lt. Marla McGivers in "Space Seed".]]
Mexican actor Ricardo Montalb<U+00E1>n was cast as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role.<ref name=gross38 /><ref name=cushman450/> He had been suggested by casting director [[Joseph D'Agosta]], who was not looking to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry's vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles.<ref name=startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed3 /> Montalb<U+00E1>n had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, ''[[The Secret Weapon of 117]]'' (also referred to as ''The Secret Defense of 117''),<ref name=gross38 /><ref name=cushman450>[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 450</ref> which was the writer's first attempt to create [[science fiction on television]] and aired more than ten years before ''Star Trek''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strange Story of Stage 7|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/10/the-strange-story-of-stage-7/|publisher=TV Obscurities|date=October 3, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221022402/http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/10/the-strange-story-of-stage-7/|archivedate=December 21, 2013|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}</ref> Montalb<U+00E1>n called his role as Khan "wonderful",<ref name=gross38 /> saying that "it was well-written, it had an interesting concept and I was delighted it was offered to me".<ref name=gross38 /> The main cast were enthusiastic about working with Montalb<U+00E1>n; DeForest Kelley later said "I enjoyed working with Ricardo the best. I was privileged. He is a marvelous actor."<ref name="cushman453"/>

Madlyn Rhue, who portrayed Lt.&nbsp;Marla McGivers, had previously worked with Montalb<U+00E1>n in an episode of ''[[Bonanza]]'' in 1960 as his on-screen wife; she later appeared with him in a 1982 episode of ''[[Fantasy Island]]''.<ref name=startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed3 /><ref name=cushman450 /> Montalb<U+00E1>n and Rhue also appeared in separate episodes of Roddenberry's previous NBC television series, ''[[The Lieutenant]]'' (1963<U+2013>1964). Main cast member [[George Takei]] did not appear in "Space Seed"; the character of [[Hikaru Sulu]] was replaced by [[MaKee K. Blaisdell|Blaisdell Makee]] as Lt.&nbsp;Spinelli. It was the first of two appearances in ''Star Trek'' for Makee, who would return in the episode "[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]" as Lt.&nbsp;Singh. [[John Winston (actor)|John Winston]] appeared for the second time as Lt.&nbsp;Kyle, and would go on to make nine further episodic appearances in that role. Following positive feedback from the producers and the network regarding James Doohan, "Space Seed" was the first episode to feature a more prominent role for his character, Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott.<ref name=cushman450 />

===Filming, costumes and post production===
Filming of "Space Seed" began December 15, 1966, and concluded on December 22 after six days of shooting.<ref name="cushman450"/> Roddenberry, Coon and Wilber's rewrites resulted in a shooting script of nearly 60&nbsp;pages and 120&nbsp;scenes.<ref name="startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed5">{{cite web|last1=Jose|first1=Maria|last2=Tenuto|first2=John|date=December 17, 2013|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/guest-blog-the-evolution-of-space-seed-part-5|title=The Evolution of "Space Seed," Part 5|work=StarTrek.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221071944/http://www.startrek.com/article/guest-blog-the-evolution-of-space-seed-part-5|archivedate=February 21, 2014|publisher=CBS Entertainment|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}</ref> [[Marc Daniels]] was hired to direct the episode; he had previously worked on ''The Lieutenant''.<ref name=evolution6 /> The first day's filming coincided with the airing of the episode "[[Balance of Terror]]", and Daniels allowed the cast and crew to go home early to watch it.<ref name=cushman451>[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 451</ref> The other five days ran to schedule, to the extent that there was an early finish on the final day of filming, allowing cast and crew time to return home to watch a repeat of the episode "[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]" which had replaced "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]" on that evening's schedule.<ref name=cushman452>[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 452</ref> A scene filmed but later cut from the episode depicted a discussion between McGivers and Angela Martine ([[Barbara Baldavin]]), intended to show that McGivers was looking for a forceful man.<ref name=cushman451/> Further scenes were trimmed after filming following input from NBC. For example, scenes shot on the ''Botany Bay'' were cut as executives felt the costumes worn by the newly awakened crew were too revealing.<ref name=cushman451/><ref name=cushman452/>

The character of Khan required five costumes, more than any other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalb<U+00E1>n's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there had been a mistake. Costume designer [[William Ware Theiss]] found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalb<U+00E1>n.<ref name="startrek.com-evolutionofspaceseed5"/> The production built two new sets for the episode: the [[decompression chamber]] in [[sickbay]], and the set on board ''Botany Bay''.<ref name=cushman451/> A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.<ref name=asherman58/>

Post production on "Space Seed" began on December 23, 1966, and ran through February 5 the following year. The Westheimer Company produced the majority of effects in the episode, but the scenes of ''Enterprise'' and ''Botany Bay'' in space were produced by Film Effects of Hollywood who were not credited on screen for their work. ''Botany Bay'' utilized a design [[Matt Jefferies]] created prior to the USS ''Enterprise''. It had been previously labeled "antique space freighter",<ref name=cushman452/> and was built by [[Film Effects of Hollywood]].<ref name=evolution6 /> The creation of the ship miniature caused the episode to go over budget by more than $12,000; "Space Seed" actually cost a total of $197,262 against a budget of $180,000. By this point, the series was nearly $80,000 over budget in total.<ref name=cushman453 /> The ''Botany Bay'' model was later re-purposed as a freighter for the episode "[[The Ultimate Computer]]".<ref name=asherman58>[[#asherman1986|Asherman (1986)]]: p. 58</ref>

The sound effects team borrowed effects and manipulated them in order to achieve the "painted sound" effect sought by Roddenberry.<ref name=cushman453 /><ref name=cushman452 /> Although a number of sources were used, they attempted to avoid most science fiction television series as they wanted an authentic sound. The sound archive of the [[United States Air Force]] was used, although the [[photon torpedo]] sound was created from the 1953 film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''.<ref name=cushman453 /> "Space Seed"  was awarded the Golden Reel for sound editing on television by the [[Motion Picture Sound Editors]] society.<ref name="cushman453">[[#cushmanosborn2013|Cushman & Osborn (2013)]]: p. 453</ref>

The review by Eugene Myers and Torrie Atkinson on [[Tor Books|Tor.com]] criticized the attraction between McGivers and Khan, saying that it was "really uncomfortable to watch her immediate attraction to him and her easy acceptance of his abusive and controlling behaviour".<ref name=torrewatch>{{cite web|last1=Myer|first1=Eugene|last2=Atkinson|first2=Torrie|title=Star Trek Re-watch: "Space Seed"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/06/lemgstar-treklemg-re-watch-space-seed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822160213/http://www.tor.com/blogs/2009/06/lemgstar-treklemg-re-watch-space-seed|archivedate=August 22, 2014|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=Tor.com|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref> However, both praised the episode, Myers giving it a five out of six, and Atkinson a six out of six rating.<ref name=torrewatch/> Also at Tor.com, in Ryan Britt and Emily Asher-Perrin's list of the ten most under-appreciated elements of ''Star Trek'', they placed "Space Seed" at number three saying that "As an introductory story to what old school Star Trek was all about, 'Space Seed' is perfect.

==Home media release and other adaptations==
The first adaptation of "Space Seed" was as a re-working into a short story by author [[James Blish]] as part of the novelization ''[[Star Trek (Blish)|Star Trek 2]]''. This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of ''The Original Series'' and was published in 1968.

The movie features errors in continuity when compared to "Space Seed". Because of re-casting, Khan's followers appear not to have aged from their appearance in the episode and Khan recognises [[Pavel Chekov]]&mdash;the character did not join ''Star Trek'' until season two, after this episode took place. This latter error was described in Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan's book ''Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text'' as the "gaff notorious throughout ''Star Trek'' fandom".<ref name=cartmel80>[[#cartmellwhelehan1999|Cartmell & Whelehan (1999)]]: p. 180</ref> An explanation was presented in the novelization of ''The Wrath of Khan'', which stated that Chekov was working on the night shift at the time.<ref name=cartmel80/>

A non-canon novelization by [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]] was later released in 2005 to fill in the timeframe between "Space Seed" and the film, titled ''[[To Reign in Hell: The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh]]''. This book expanded on Khan's romance with McGivers, and the author wanted to "give her a spine" as he felt that she was not "the pride of Starfleet, and even less of a feminist role-model" in her appearance in "Space Seed".<ref name=reigninhell>[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: pp. 144 & 145</ref>

Events of both "Space Seed" and ''The Wrath of Khan'' were also directly referenced in 2013's ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', in which [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] portrayed Khan.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ediden|first=Rachel|title=The Braver, Better Movie That Star Trek Into Darkness Could Have Been|url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-carol-marcus/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218215612/http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/05/star-trek-into-darkness-carol-marcus/|archivedate=February 18, 2014|accessdate=December 25, 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> The film took $70.1 million on the opening weekend, and $467.3 million internationally throughout the cinematic release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Trek Into Darkness|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=startrek12.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}</ref> As part of their line of licensed ''Star Trek'' comic books, [[IDW Publishing]] launched a five part mini-series titled ''[[Star Trek: Khan]]'' which described the early part of Khan's life and how the events in ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' diverged from those seen in "Space Seed".<ref name=khancomicfirst /><ref name=khancomicfifth>{{cite web|title=FIRST LOOK: Final Khan Adventure, Star Trek: Khan #5|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/first-look-final-khan-adventure-star-trek-khan-5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301210356/http://www.startrek.com/article/first-look-final-khan-adventure-star-trek-khan-5|archivedate=March 1, 2014|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=CBS Entertainment|date=February 17, 2014|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> One of the writers of the film, [[Roberto Orci]], was the story consultant on the comic series.

===The Eugenics Wars===
The Eugenics Wars, first mentioned in "Space Seed", are stated in the ''Star Trek Chronology'' by [[Michael Okuda|Michael]] and [[Denise Okuda]] as taking place between 1992 and 1996. They considered it fortunate that these events did not come to pass in the real world, and noted that the development of the ''Botany Bay'' in 1996 as an instance of where "''Star Trek''{{'s}} technological predictions have missed by a significant margin."<ref>[[#okudaokuda1993|Okuda & Okuda (1993)]]: p. 16</ref> The war itself has been referenced elsewhere in the ''Star Trek'' franchise. The first mention of the wars following "Space Seed" was in the ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[The Infinite Vulcan]]", in which a cloned version of Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a scientist from that era, clones Spock.<ref>[[#grossaltman1993|Gross & Altman (1993)]]: p. 97</ref> Later, during the production of the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Doctor Bashir, I Presume?]]", writer [[Ren<U+00E9> Echevarria]], seeking a secret past for Doctor [[Julian Bashir]], noted that coverage of the issue of eugenics in ''Star Trek'' had been limited to Khan and his followers . Fellow writer [[Ronald D. Moore]] decided to link the background of Bashir to genetic engineering.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 431</ref> However, there was a continuity error in the script for "Doctor Bashir, I Presume?". When Echevarria wrote that the Eugenics Wars took place 200 years before the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode, he took the time interval directly from ''The Wrath of Khan'', failing to factor in the additional century between the events of the ''The Original Series'' (and its associated films) and the later series.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 433</ref>

Novelist Gary Cox first mentioned the events of the Eugenics Wars in his non-canon novel ''Assignment: Eternity'', which followed up on the events of the episode "[[Assignment: Earth]]" and included the characters of [[Gary Seven]] and Roberta Lincoln.<ref>[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: p. 114</ref> In it, he mentioned that Seven and Lincoln were involved in overthrowing Khan during the Eugenics Wars. He had not intended to explore this any further, but he was prompted to do so by his editor at [[Pocket Books]]. He wrote a story, split into two books, about the specific events of the Eugenics Wars, entitled ''Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh''. As the Eugeneics Wars were already meant to have taken place, he decided to describe them as being a massive conspiracy that was not discovered until generations had passed.<ref name=eugenicsbooks>[[#ayers2006|Ayers (2006)]]: pp. 133 & 134</ref> He also felt that this approach would make the books consistent with the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[Future's End]]" in which the crewmembers travel in time to the same period of Earth's history as the Eugenics Wars, but find no such wars taking place.<ref name=eugenicsbooks/> A further version of the Eugenics Wars was presented in the ''Star Trek: Khan'' comic book mini-series.<ref name=khancomicfirst>{{cite web|title=FIRST LOOK: IDW's Khan #1|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/first-look-idws-khan-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219234527/http://www.startrek.com/article/first-look-idws-khan-1|archivedate=February 19, 2014|work=StarTrek.com|publisher=CBS Entertainment|date=October 15, 2013|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref>
