== Etymology ==
[[File:Tiperit en Klus.JPG|thumb|left|Romanian inscription of a religious book: "Tiperit en Klus en Anul Domnului 1703" (Printed in Klus AD 1703).]]

On the site of the city was a pre-Roman settlement named Napoca. After the AD 106 [[Roman Empire|Roman]] conquest of the area, the place was known as ''Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca''. Possible etymologies for ''Napoca'' or ''Napuca'' include the names of some [[Dacia]]n tribes such as the Naparis or Napaei, the Greek term ''napos'' (<U+03BD><U+03AC><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C2>), meaning "timbered valley" or the Indo-European root ''*sn<U+0101>-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches W<U+00F6>rterbuch|Pokorny]] 971-2), "to flow, to swim, damp".<ref name="etim-napoca">Luk<U+00E1>cs 2005, p.14</ref>

===Roman Empire===

The [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Dacia]] in AD 101 and 106, during the rule of [[Trajan]], and the Roman settlement Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 in the vicinity of the city.<ref name="roman">Lazarovici ''et. al.'' 1997, pp. 202-3 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs)</ref> Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] granted Napoca the status of ''[[municipium]]'' as ''municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses''. Later, in the 2nd century AD,<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p. 17 (2.7 Napoca roman<U+0103>)</ref> the city gained the status of a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' as ''Colonia Aurelia Napoca''. Napoca became a provincial capital of [[Dacia Porolissensis]] and thus the seat of a [[promagistrate|procurator]]. The ''colonia'' was evacuated in 274 by the Romans.<ref name="roman"/> There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.89</ref>

===Middle Ages===

At the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]], two groups of buildings existed on the current site of the city: the wooden fortress at [[M<U+0103>n<U+0103><U+015F>tur|Cluj-M<U+0103>n<U+0103><U+015F>tur]] (''Kolozsmonostor'') and the civilian settlement developed around the current ''Pia<U+0163>a Muzeului'' (Museum Place) in the city centre.<ref name="medieval"/><ref name="alicu">Alicu 2003, p.9</ref> Although the precise date of the conquest of Transylvania by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] is not known, the earliest Hungarian artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Madgearu|first=Alexandru|title=Rom<U+00E2>nii <U+00EE>n opera Notarului Anonim|year=2001|isbn=973-577-249-3|publisher=Centrul de Studii Transilvane, Funda<U+021B>ia Cultural<U+0103> Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>|location=Cluj-Napoca}}</ref> In any case, after that time, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] made the city the seat of the castle county of Kolozs, and King Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] founded the abbey of Cluj-M<U+0103>n<U+0103><U+015F>tur (''Kolozsmonostor''), destroyed during the [[Tatar]] invasions in 1241 and 1285.<ref name="medieval"/> As for the civilian colony, a castle and a village were built to the northwest of the ancient Napoca no later than the late 12th century.<ref name="medieval"/> This new village was settled by large groups of [[Transylvanian Saxons]], encouraged during the reign of Crown Prince [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]], Duke of Transylvania.<ref name="sasi"/> The first reliable mention of the settlement dates from 1275, in a document of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]], when the village (''Villa Kulusvar'') was granted to the Bishop of Transylvania.<ref name="first-mention">Lazarovici et al. 1997, p. 204 (6.3 Medieval Cluj)</ref> On August 19, 1316, during the rule of the new king, [[Charles I of Hungary]], Cluj was granted the status of a city ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''civitas''), as a reward for the Saxons' contribution to the defeat of the rebellious Transylvanian [[voivode]], [[Ladislaus K<U+00E1>n]].<ref name="first-mention"/>

After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Klausenburg and all of Transylvania were again integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the autumn of 1918, as World War I drew to a close, Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity, headed by [[Amos Fr<U+00E2>ncu]].

=== Climate ===

Cluj-Napoca has a [[continental climate]], characterised by warm dry summers and cold winters. The climate is influenced by the city's proximity to the [[Apuseni Mountains]], as well as by [[urbanisation]]. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}, even though they rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C|F|0}}. On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter.<ref>{{cite web

Although average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between {{convert|13|C|F|0}} to {{convert|18|C|F|0}}, and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.

Because of the last years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Beca<U+015F>, F<U+0103>get, Zorilor South), but most of them are still construction sites.<ref>{{cite web

Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is the capital of [[Cluj County]], the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the headquarters of the [[county council]] (''consiliu jude<U+0163>ean'') and the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]], who is appointed by Romania's central government.<ref name="law-admin"/> The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a [[political party]], and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level.<ref name="law-admin"/> Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.<ref name="law-admin"/>

Cluj-Napoca is also the capital of the historical region of [[Transylvania]], a status that resonates to this day. Currently, the city is the largest in the [[Nord-Vest (development region)|Nord-Vest development region]], which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the [[European Union]] and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development. The Nord-Vest development region is not, however, an administrative entity.<ref name="law-admin"/> The [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area]] became operational in December 2008,<ref name="ziua-metropola"/> and comprises a population of 392,562.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011"/><ref name="periurban"/> Besides Cluj-Napoca, it includes seventeen [[Communes of Romania|communes]]: [[Aiton, Cluj|Aiton]], [[Apahida]], [[Baciu]], [[Bon<U+0163>ida]], [[Bor<U+0219>a, Cluj|Bor<U+015F>a]], [[C<U+0103>ianu]], [[Chinteni]], [[Ciurila]], [[Cojocna]], [[Feleacu]], [[Flore<U+015F>ti, Cluj|Flore<U+015F>ti]], [[G<U+00E2>rb<U+0103>u, Cluj|G<U+00E2>rb<U+0103>u]], [[Gil<U+0103>u, Cluj|Gil<U+0103>u]], [[Jucu]], [[Petre<U+015F>tii de Jos]], [[Tureni]] and [[Vultureni, Cluj|Vultureni]].

In order to counterbalance the political influence of Transylvania's Hungarian minority, nationalist Romanians in Transylvania founded the [[Party of Romanian National Unity]] (PUNR) at the beginnings of the 1990s; the party was present in the Romanian Parliament during the 1992&ndash;1996 legislature.<ref name="punr">{{cite web

Eleven hospitals function in the city, nine of which are run by the county and two (for oncology and cardiology) by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Romania)|health ministry]]. Additionally, there are well over a hundred private medical cabinets and dentists' offices each.<ref name="hall-geography"/>

=== Justice system ===
Cluj-Napoca has a complex judicial organisation, as a consequence of its status of [[Cluj County|county]] capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of [[Dej]], [[Gherla]], [[Turda]] and [[Huedin]].<ref name="lege-jude">{{cite web

Also notorious was the case of serial killer [[Romulus Vere<U+015F>]], "the man with the hammer"; during the 1970s, he was charged with five murders and several [[attempted murder]]s, but never imprisoned on [[Insanity defense|grounds of insanity]]: he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], blaming the [[Devil]] for his actions. Instead, he was institutionalised in the <U+015E>tei psychiatric facility in 1976, following a three-year [[forensic]] investigation during which four thousand people were questioned. [[Urban myth]]s brought the number of victims up to two hundred women, though the actual number was much smaller. This confusion is probably explained by the lack of attention this case received, despite its magnitude, in the Communist press of the time.<ref>{{cite web

A 2006 poll shows a high degree of satisfaction with the work of the local police department.

Efforts made by local authorities in the Cluj-Napoca district at the end of the 1990s to reform the protection of [[children's rights]] and assistance for [[street children]] proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.<ref name="report-street-children">{{cite web|url=http://www.streetchildren.org.uk/reports/Romania%20JJ%20report%20-%20FINAL%204.04.doc|title=Street Children and Juvenile Justice in Romania|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher="Asocia<U+0163>ia pentru Sprijinirea Integr<U+0103>rii Sociale" (ASIS) in partnership with "The Consortium for Street Children"|format=DOC|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080627181914/http://www.streetchildren.org.uk/reports/Romania%20JJ%20report%20-%20FINAL%204.04.doc |archivedate = June 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

From 2000 onwards, Cluj-Napoca has seen an increase in illegal [[streetracing|road races]], which occur mainly at night on the city's outskirts or on industrial sites and occasionally produce victims. There have been attempts to organize legal races as a solution to this problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/cursele-de-masini-pe-timp-de-noapte-intra-in-legalitate/123606|author=C<U+0103>lina Berceanu|title=Cursele de ma<U+015F>ini pe timp de noapte intr<U+0103> <U+00EE>n legalitate|publisher=Adev<U+0103>rul|date=2005-04-07|accessdate=2008-03-14|language=Romanian}}</ref>

The city's population, at the 2011 [[census]], was 309,136 inhabitants,<ref name="population-2002"/> or 1.6% of the total population of Romania. The population of the [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area]] is estimated at 392,562.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011"/><ref name="metro"/> Finally, the population of the peri-urban area numbers over 400,000 residents.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011"/><ref name="periurban"/> The new [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area|metropolitan government of Cluj-Napoca]] became operational in December 2008.<ref name="ziua-metropola"/> According to the 2007 data provided by the County Population Register Service, the total population of the city is as high as 392,276 people.<ref name="flotanti"/> The variation between this number and the census data is partially explained by the real growth of the population residing in Cluj-Napoca, as well as by different counting methods: "In reality, more people live in Cluj than those who are officially registered", Traian Rotariu, director of the Center for Population Studies, told ''Foaia Transilvan<U+0103>''.<ref name="flotanti"/> Moreover, this number does not include the floating population<U+2014>an average of over 20 thousand people each year during 2004&ndash;2007, according to the same source.<ref name="flotanti"/>

In the modern era, Cluj's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first in the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the [[Communist Romania|Communist period]], when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people [[Urbanization|migrated from rural areas]] and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.112</ref> About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on [[Net migration rate|net migration]] inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceau<U+015F>escu's ban on abortion and contraception, [[natural increase]] was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.<ref name=industrialisation/>

From the [[Middle Ages]] onwards, the city of Cluj has been a multicultural city with a diverse cultural and religious life. According to the 2011 Romanian census, just over 80% of the population of the city are [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]], with the second largest ethnic group being the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], who make up 16% of the population. The remainder is composed of [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] (1.1%), [[ethnic German|Germans]] (0.17%) and [[Jews]] (0.05%).<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011"/> Today, the city receives a large influx of migrants: 25,000 people requested residence in the city during 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftr.ro/wanted-clujeanul-verde-2898.php|title=Wanted: Clujeanul verde|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Foaia Transilvan<U+0103>|language=Romanian}}</ref>

In terms of religion, 69.2% of the population are [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and 12.2% are [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]]. The [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic]] communities claim 5.5% and 5.8% of the population respectively, while other religious groups like [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarians]] (1%), [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] (2.6%) or [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptists]] (1.2%) round out most of the rest.<ref name="population-2002"/> By contrast, in 1930, the city was 26.7% Reformed, 22.6% Greek Catholic, 20.1% Roman Catholic, 13.4% Jewish, 11.8% Orthodox, 2.4% Lutheran and 2.1% Unitarian.<ref>{{cite book|title=Popula<U+0163>ia Statornic<U+0103> <U+00EE>n 1930 Dup<U+0103> Religie|volume=Volume 2, Part 2|page=588|publisher=Institutul Central de Statistic<U+0103>|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/c/cd/Cluj_religie_1930.jpg|accessdate=2008-03-21|language=Romanian}}</ref> Contributing factors for these shifts were the extermination<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/Holocaust/0127_Cluj-survivors.html|title=Cluj Children Survivors|date=2006-01|accessdate=2008-04-05|publisher=JewishGen}}</ref> and emigration<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35722.htm|title=Background Note: Romania

In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Klausenburg, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania<ref name="princeton"/> and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian, a language that many Saxons gradually adopted.<ref name="centumvirate"/> (In the seventeenth century, out of more than thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsv<U+00E1>r/Klausenburg being one of them;<ref name=Review>{{cite journal|last=Szel<U+00E9>nyi|first=Bal<U+00E1>zs|authorlink=|coauthors=|year=2004|month=April|title=The Dynamics of Urban Development: Towns in Sixteenth and Seventeenth-Century Hungary|journal=[[The American Historical Review]]|volume=|issue=|page=22|id=|url=http://historycooperative.press.uiuc.edu/journals/ahr/109.2/szelenyi.html#FOOT31|accessdate=2008-05-27|quote=}}</ref> the rest were largely German-dominated.<ref name=Review/>) In this manner Kolozsv<U+00E1>r became largely Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.93</ref>

The [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] form a sizable minority in contemporary Romania, and a small but visible presence in Cluj-Napoca: self-identifying Roma in the city comprise only 1 percent of the population; yet they are a familiar presence in and around the central market, selling flowers, used clothes and tinware.<ref name="princeton"/> They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been a major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.<ref name="princeton"/>

Cluj-Napoca has a diverse and growing cultural scene, with cultural life exhibited in a number of fields, including the [[visual arts]], [[performing arts]] and [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]]. The city's cultural scene spans its history, dating back to Roman times: the city started to be built in that period, which has left its mark on the urban layout (centered on today's Pia<U+0163>a Muzeului) as well as surviving ruins.

[[File:Cluj-Napoca Central Park-statue 01.jpg|thumb||The [[Cluj-Napoca Central Park|Central Park]]]]
Cluj-Napoca has a number of landmark buildings and monuments. One of those is the [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|Saint Michael's Church]] in [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|''Unirii'' Square]], built at the end of the 14th century in the [[gothic art|Gothic style]] of that period. It was only in the 19th century that the [[neogothic]] tower of the church was erected; it remains the tallest church tower in Romania to this day.<ref name="sf-mihail">Luk<U+00E1>cs 2005</ref>

In front of the church is the [[Equestrian sculpture|equestrian statue]] of [[Matthias Corvinus]], erected in honour of the locally born [[Kingdom of Hungary|king of Hungary]]. The [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church's]] equivalent to St. Michael's Church is the [[Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral, Cluj-Napoca|Orthodox Cathedral]] on [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|''Avram Iancu'' Square]], built in the [[interwar]] era. The [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] also has a cathedral in Cluj-Napoca, [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Cluj-Napoca|Transfiguration Cathedral]].

Another landmark of Cluj-Napoca is the [[Palace of Justice, Cluj-Napoca|Palace of Justice]], built between 1898 and 1902, and designed by architect Gyula Wagner in an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] style.<ref name="palat-justitie">{{cite web

Many of the city's notable figures are buried in Hajongard Cemetery, which covers {{convert|14|ha|acre}}.

As an important cultural centre, Cluj-Napoca has many theatres and museums. The latter include the [[National Museum of Transylvanian History]], the [[Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania|Ethnographic Museum]], the [[Cluj-Napoca B<U+00E1>nffy Palace|Cluj-Napoca Art Museum]], the Pharmacy Museum, the Water Museum and the museums of [[Babe<U+015F>-Bolyai University]]&mdash;the University Museum, the Museum of Mineralogy, the Museum of Paleontology and Stratigraphy, the Museum of Speleology, the Botanical Museum and the Zoological Museum.

=== Visual arts ===
[[File:Place Avram Iancu & Theatre National, Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu Square]]]]

In terms of [[visual arts]], the city contains a number of galleries featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art, as well as selected international works.

The [[B<U+00E1>nffy Palace|National Museum of Art]] is located in the former palace of the count Gy<U+00F6>rgy B<U+00E1>nffy, the most representative secular construction built in the [[Baroque]] style in [[Transylvania]].<ref>{{cite web

The most notable of the city's other galleries is the ''Gallery of the Union of Plastic Artists''. Situated in the city centre, this gallery presents collections drawn from the contemporary arts scene. The Gallery of Folk Art includes traditional Romanian interior decoration artworks.

Historically, the city was one of the most important cultural and artistic centres in 16th-century Transylvania. The Renaissance workshop, formed in 1530 and strongly supported by the Transylvanian princes, served local and wider requirements: from the middle of the century onwards, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs|conquered]] central Hungary, it extended its activity throughout the new principality. Its style, the "Flower Renaissance", used a variety of plant ornament enriched with coats of arms, figures and inscriptions. It continued to be of great importance into the 18th century, and traces of it are still apparent in 20th-century vernacular art; Klausenburg was central to the long, anachronistic survival of the style, particularly among Hungarians.<ref name="Grove"/>

Some other clubs in the centre are Aftereight, Avenue, Bamboo, Decadence, Kharma and Molotov Pub. Numerous restaurants, pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine; many of these offer cultural activities like music and fashion shows or art exhibitions.<ref name="Dezbatere"/>

The city also includes [[Strada Piezi<U+015F><U+0103>]] (''slanted street''), a central nightlife strip located in the Ha<U+015F>deu student area, where a large number of bars and terraces are situated. Cluj-Napoca is not limited to these international music genres, as there are also a number of [[discoth<U+00E8>que|discos]] where local "[[L<U+0103>utari]]" play [[manele]], a Turkish-influenced type of music.

=== Traditional culture ===
In spite of the influences of modern culture, traditional Romanian culture continues to influence various domains of art.

[[File:ClujMuzeulIstorie.jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Museum of Transylvanian History]]]]
Cluj-Napoca hosts an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] museum, the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania, which features a large indoor collection of traditional cultural objects, as well as an open-air park, the oldest of this kind in Romania, dating back to 1929.<ref>{{cite web

== Architecture ==

Cluj-Napoca's salient architecture is primarily [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the [[Mid-Century modern|mid-century style]]. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era architecture is also present, although only to a certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large [[systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.<ref name="iaim">{{cite web

[[File:Palatul Szeky din Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|[[Szeky Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Szeky Palace]]]]

The nucleus of the old city, an important cultural and commercial centre, used to be a military camp, attested in documents with the name "castrum Clus".

[[File:CJROmaniustreet.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|I. Maniu Street]]: construction of this symmetrical street was undertaken during the 19th century]]
The oldest residence in Cluj-Napoca is the house of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]], originally a Gothic structure that bears Transylvanian [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] characteristics due to a later renovation.<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.56 (3.2 Monumente medievale)</ref> Such changes feature on other Hungarian townspeople's residences, built from the mid-15th century mostly of stone and wood with a cellar, ground floor and upper storey, in the Late Gothic and Renaissance styles; although the late medieval houses have often been considerably altered, the street fa<U+00E7>ades of the old town are mostly preserved.<ref name="Grove">{{cite web
|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T018268|title=Cluj-Napoca|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|St. Michael's Church]], the oldest and most representative Gothic-style building in the country, dates back to the 14th century. The oldest of its sections is the altar, dedicated in 1390, while the newest part is the clock tower, which was built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style (1860).<ref name="sf-mihail"/>

As Renaissance styles survived late in the city, the appearance of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at the centre of the development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, but by the end of the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the ''[[Adoration of the Magi in art|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1748<U+2013>50) is the work of [[Franz Anton Maulbertsch]]. The [[Cluj-Napoca Piarists' Church|earliest two-towered Baroque church]] was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of [[Ko<U+0161>ice]] and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town.<ref name="Grove"/> The Baroque [[B<U+00E1>nffy Palace]] (1774<U+2013>1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in the appearance of the principal fa<U+00E7>ade.<ref name="iaim"/>

Both [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu]] and [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unrii Squares]] feature ensembles of [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] and [[baroque]]&ndash;[[rococo]] architecture, including the [[Palace of Justice, Cluj-Napoca|Palace of Justice]],<ref name="palat-justitie"/> the [[Cluj-Napoca National Theatre|Theatre]],<ref name="teatru"/> the [[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|Iuliu Maniu symmetrical street]],<ref name="maniu-street"/> and the New York Palace, among others.<ref>{{cite web

Also dating to that period are the [[Church with the Two Towers|two-towered Neo-classical Calvinist church]] (1829<U+2013>50), its new college building of 1801, and the City Hall (1843<U+2013>6) in the marketplace, by [[Antal Kagerbauer]].<ref name="Grove"/>

The banks of the Some<U+015F>ul Mic also feature a wide variety of such old buildings. The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over the river, at the north end of the [[Regele Ferdinand Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Regele Ferdinand Avenue]]. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and [[Szeky Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Szeky]] palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the [[Art Nouveau]]/Secession and Revival specifics.<ref>Alicu et al. 1995, p.30</ref>

In the 2000s, the old city centre underwent extensive restoration works, meant to convert much of it into a [[pedestrian]] area, including [[Eroilor Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Bulevardul Eroilor]], [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unirii Square]] and other smaller streets.<ref>{{cite web

=== Modern and Communist architecture ===
[[File:Teatrul Maghiar Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cluj-Napoca Hungarian Theatre|Hungarian State Theatre and Opera]]]]
[[File:Blocks Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|Blocks of flats in central Cluj-Napoca]]

Part of Cluj-Napoca's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]], when historical architecture was replaced with "more efficient" high-density apartment blocks. Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu's project of [[Systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] did not really affect the heart of the city, instead reaching the marginal, shoddily built districts surrounding it.<ref name="iaim"/>

Still, the centre hosts some examples of modern architecture dating back to the Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected at the beginning of the 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired a [[modernist architecture|modernist style of architecture]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.huntheater.ro/oldal.php?soid=9&mm=11&sl=7|title=Detailed technical description|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Hungarian Theatre of Cluj}}</ref> Another example of modernist architectural art is ''Palatul Telefoanelor'', situated in the vicinity of [[Michael the Brave|Mihai Viteazul]] Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.

Some outer districts, especially [[M<U+0103>n<U+0103><U+015F>tur]], and to a certain extent [[Gheorgheni, Cluj-Napoca|Gheorgheni]] and [[Grigorescu, Cluj-Napoca|Grigorescu]], consist mainly of such large apartment ensembles.<ref name="iaim"/> The city, however, does not face the zoning problems that arose in other Romanian locales because of the high-density constructions; roughly all other complexes in the city are built with some respect to the zoning laws in force today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

=== Contemporary architecture ===
[[File:Cladirea biscuite Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|"Cl<U+0103>direa biscuite"]]
{{Main|Contemporary architecture in Cluj-Napoca}}
Since 1989, modern [[skyscraper]]s and glass-fronted buildings have altered the skyline of Cluj-Napoca. Buildings from this time are mostly made out of glass and [[steel]], and are usually high-rise. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the [[Iulius Mall Cluj|Iulius Mall]]), office buildings and bank headquarters. Of this last, regional headquarters of the [[Banca Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103> pentru Dezvoltare]] is the tallest office building in Cluj-Napoca, with {{convert|50|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web

Another [[Architecture|architecturally]] interesting building is the so-called "Cl<U+0103>direa biscuite" (''the biscuit building''). This building was supposed to house the local headquarters of the Banca Agricol<U+0103> (Agricultural Bank), but entered in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank in the 1990s and its subsequent purchase by the [[Raiffeisen Romania|Raiffeisen Bank]], to be eventually converted in an office building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1711762-emil-boc-inventeaza-tivul-biscuit-city-business-center-plateste-primariei-cluj-napoca-parcare-care-nu-are.htm|title=Emil Boc inventeaza "tivul la Biscuit"|publisher=Romania liber<U+0103>.

== Transport ==
Cluj-Napoca has a complex system of regional transportation, providing road, air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe. It also features a public transportation system consisting of bus, trolleybus and tram lines.

Cluj-Napoca is an important node in the [[International E-road network|European road network]], being on three different European routes ([[European route E60|E60]], [[European route E81|E81]] and [[European route E576|E576]]). At a [[Roads in Romania|national level]], Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: [[DN1]], DN1C and DN1F. The [[Transylvania motorway (Romania)|Romanian Motorway A3]], also known as ''Transylvania Motorway'' (''Autostrada Transilvania''), currently under construction, will link the city with [[Bucharest]] and Romania's western border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autostradatransilvania.ro/www/index.html/articles|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120091947/http://www.autostradatransilvania.ro/www/index.html/articles|archivedate=2008-01-20|title=Technical Data|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Bechtel|unused_data=displayArticle?artID=3}}</ref> The 2B section between [[C<U+00E2>mpia Turzii]] and Cluj Vest ([[Gil<U+0103>u, Cluj|Gil<U+0103>u]]) opened in late 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=7150|title=O jum<U+0103>tate de miliard de euro pentru autostrad<U+0103>|date=2008-01-12|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Ziua de Cluj|language=Romanian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Situated on the [[European route E576]] (Cluj-Napoca <U+2013> [[Dej]]), the airport is connected to the city centre by the local public transport company, RATUC, bus number 8. The airport serves various direct international destinations across Europe.

[[Cluj-Napoca railway station|Cluj-Napoca Rail Station]], located about {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the city centre, is situated on the [[C<U+0103>ile Ferate Rom<U+00E2>ne|CFR-Romanian Railways]] Main Line 300 ([[Bucharest]] <U+2013> [[Oradea]] <U+2013> Romanian Western Border) and on Line 401 (Cluj-Napoca <U+2013> [[Dej]]). CFR provides direct rail connections to all the major Romanian cities and to [[Budapest]]. The rail station is very well connected to all parts of the city by the [[tram]]s, [[trolleybus]]es and [[bus]]es of the local public transport company, RATUC.

[[File:Irisbus-Cluj3.jpg|thumb|City bus in Cluj-Napoca on route 32b]]
The city is also served by two other secondary rail stations, the ''Little Station'' (''Gara Mic<U+01CE>''), which is technically part of and situated immediately near the main station, and ''Cluj-Napoca East'' (''Est''). There is also a cargo station, ''Halta "Clujana"''.

The local transportation company, RATUC, manages a [[tram]] line that runs through the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This will bring a number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, long use expectancy and higher [[Mass transit|transit]] speed <U+2013> {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}-{{convert|80|km/h|mph}}.<ref>{{cite web

== Media and popular culture ==
Cluj-Napoca is the most important centre for [[Transylvania]]n mass media, since it is the headquarters of all regional television networks, newspapers and radio stations. The largest daily newspapers published in [[Bucharest]] are usually reissued from Cluj-Napoca in a regional version, covering Transylvanian issues. Such newspapers include ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Liber<U+0103>]]'', ''[[Gardianul]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-na<U+0163>ional-Gardianul-<U+00EE><U+015F>i-lanseaz<U+0103>-edi<U+0163>ie-regioanal<U+0103>_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13|title=Cotidianul na<U+0163>ional Gardianul <U+00EE><U+015F>i lanseaz<U+0103> edi<U+0163>ie regional<U+0103>|date=2008-03-15|accessdate=2008-03-15|publisher=Realitatea Cluj|language=Romanian |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080503031822/http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-na%C5%A3ional-Gardianul-%C3%AE%C5%9Fi-lanseaz%C4%83-edi%C5%A3ie-regioanal%C4%83_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13 |archivedate = May 3, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', ''[[ProSport]]'' and ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]''.

Apart from the regional editions, which are distributed throughout [[Transylvania]], the national newspaper ''[[Ziua]]'' also runs a local franchise, ''Ziua de Cluj'', that acts as a local daily, available only within city limits. Cluj-Napoca also boasts other newspapers of local interest, like ''[[F<U+0103>clia]]'' and ''[[Monitorul de Cluj]]'', as well as two free dailies, ''[[Informa<U+0163>ia Cluj]]'' and ''[[Cluj Expres]]''. ''[[Clujeanul]]'', the first of a series of local weeklies edited by the media trust [[Central European Media Enterprises|CME]], is one of the largest newspapers in Transylvania, with an audience of 53,000 readers per edition.<ref>{{cite web

Among the local television stations in the city, ''[[TVR Cluj]]'' (public) and ''[[One TV (Romania)|One TV]]'' (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. ''[[Napoca Cable Network]]'' is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports in addition to the national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for ''[[Radio Cluj]]'', ''[[Radio Impuls]]'' and the Hungarian-language ''[[Paprika R<U+00E1>di<U+00F3>]]'', all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. ''Casa Radio'', situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: [[Palatul Telefoanelor, Cluj-Napoca|Palatul Telefoanelor]] ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Magazines published in Cluj-Napoca include ''HR Journal'', a publication discussing human resources issues, ''[[J'Adore (magazine)|J'Adore]]'', a local shopping magazine that is also franchised in Bucharest, ''Maximum Rock Magazine'', dealing with the [[rock music]] industry, ''RDV'', a national hunting publication and ''Cluj-Napoca WWW'', an English-language magazine designed for tourists. Cultural and social events as well as all other entertainment sources are the leading subjects of such magazines as ''[[<U+015E>apte Seri]]'' and ''CJ24FUN''.

In the early 20th century, film production in Kolozsv<U+00E1>r, led by [[Jen<U+0151> Janovics]], was the chief alternative to Budapest.<ref name="filmkultura"/> The first film made in the city, in association with the Parisian producer [[Path<U+00E9>]], was ''S<U+00E1>rga csik<U+00F3>'' ("Yellow Foal", 1912), based on a popular "peasant drama". ''Yellow Foal'' became the first worldwide Hungarian success, distributed abroad under the title ''The Secret of the Blind Man'': 137 prints were sold internationally and the movie was even screened in Japan.<ref name="filmkultura"/>

The first artistically prestigious film in the annals of Hungarian cinematography was also produced on this site, based on a national classic, ''[[B<U+00E1>nk b<U+00E1>n]]'' (1914), a tragedy written by [[J<U+00F3>zsef Katona]].<ref name="filmkultura"/>

The university claims roots as far back as 1581, when a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college opened in Cluj, but it was in 1872 that emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] founded the University of Cluj, later renamed the ''Franz Joseph University'' (J<U+00F3>zsef Ferenc Tudom<U+00E1>nyegyetem).<ref name="francisc-iosif">{{cite web

The Romanian branch acquired the name ''Babe<U+015F>''; a Hungarian university, ''Bolyai'', was established in 1945, and the two were merged in 1959.

== Footnotes ==
a.{{note label|a|a|none}} The engraving, dating back to 1617, was executed by Georg Houfnagel after the painting of Egidius van der Rye (the original was done in the workshop of Braun and Hagenberg).

b.{{note label|b|b|none}} After Transylvania united with Romania in 1918&ndash;1920, an exodus of Hungarian inhabitants occurred. Also, the city grew and many people moved in from the surrounding area and Cluj County as a whole, populated largely by Romanians.

c.{{note label|c|c|none}} In August 1940, as the second Vienna Award transferred the northern half of Transylvania to Hungary, an exile of Romanian inhabitants began.

d.{{note label|d|d|none}} The 1941 Hungarian census is considered unreliable by most historians. In 1941, Cluj had 16,763 Jews. They were forced into ghettos in 1944 by the Hungarian authorities and deported to Auschwitz in May<U+2013>June 1944.

e.{{note label|e|e|none}} In the 1960s a determined policy of industrialisation was initiated. Many people from the surrounding rural areas (largely Romanian) moved into the city, giving Cluj a Romanian majority.
