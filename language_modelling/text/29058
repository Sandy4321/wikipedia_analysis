'''''Half-Life 2''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[first-person shooter]] [[Computer and video games|computer game]] and the sequel to ''[[Half-Life]]'', developed by [[Valve Corporation]]. It was released on November 16, [[2004 in video gaming|2004]] following a protracted five-year development cycle during which the game's [[source code]] was [[Half-Life 2 controversies and criticisms|leaked to the Internet]]. The game garnered very positive reviews and received critical acclaim<ref name="reviews1">{{cite web | url = http://www.gametab.com/pc/half-life.2/1449/ | title =  Half-Life 2 reviews for the PC | work = GameTab | accessdate = June 5 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref> <ref name="reviews2">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/914642.asp | title = Half-Life 2 reviews | work = GameRankings | accessdate = May 19 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> <ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/halflife2 | title = Half-Life 2 (pc: 2004): reviews) | work = Metacritic | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, earning over 35 Game of the Year (2005) awards<ref name="sales">{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/archive/forbes/2005/1212/064.html | title = It's A Mod, Mod Underworld  | work = Forbes Magazine | accessdate = December 12 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref>.

Taking place in and around the fictional [[City 17]] sometime in the near future, ''Half-Life 2'' follows the scientist [[Gordon Freeman]]. Dr. Freeman is thrust into a [[dystopia]]n environment in which the fallout (so to speak) of the [[Half-Life|Black Mesa Incident]] has fully come to bear upon human society. Freeman is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive. In his struggle, he is joined by various allies, including fellow Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the [[vortigaunt]]s.

The game uses the [[Source engine|Source]] [[game engine]] coupled with a heavily modified version of the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics engine]]. ''Half-Life 2'' has been critically acclaimed for advances in [[computer animation]], [[sound]], [[narrator|narration]], [[computer graphics]], [[Game AI|artificial intelligence]] (AI) and [[Physics engine|physics]]. To date, over four million copies of ''Half-Life 2'' have been sold<ref name="hl2sales">{{cite web | url = http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=648 | title = About Half-Life 2 | work = Steam News | accessdate = June 09 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

== Story ==
{{spoiler}}
=== Prologue ===

The original ''Half-Life'', released on November 20, [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], largely took place at a remote civilian and military laboratory called the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. During an experiment, researchers at Black Mesa accidentally caused a "resonance cascade" which ripped open a portal to an alien world called [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]]. Creatures from Xen flooded into Black Mesa via the portal and started to kill anyone in sight. The player took on the role of [[Gordon Freeman]], one of the research scientists involved in the accident, guiding him in his attempt to escape the facility. At the end of the game, Gordon was extracted by a mysterious figure colloquially known as the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]] who "offered" him employment. Freeman was subsequently put into [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] by the G-Man.

''Half-Life'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]] dictates that Gordon Freeman either agreed or was not given a real option in regards to the G-Man's ultimatum. ''Half-Life 2'' picks up the story with the G-Man taking Freeman out of stasis and inserting him on a train en-route to [[City 17]] an indeterminate number of years after the Black Mesa Incident. Official sources are conflicting about the actual length of this intermission - a story fragment written by author [[Marc Laidlaw]] for the development team puts the intermission at ten years<ref name="raisebar">{{cite book | author = Hodgson, David | year = 2004 | title = Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar | publisher = Prima Games | id = ISBN 0761543643 }}</ref>, while ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'''s website puts this intermission as "nearly two decades" after the end of the events of ''Half-Life''<ref name="episode1webpage">{{cite web | url = http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php | title = Half-Life 2: Episode One | work = Valve Corporation | accessdate = May 19 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

=== Plot ===
{{main|Half-Life 2 storyline}}

[[Image:800px-Breen1HL2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|When [[Doctor Isaac Kleiner|Doctor Kleiner]]'s teleporter malfunctions, Gordon is momentarily transported to [[Doctor Wallace Breen|Doctor Breen]]'s office.]]

At the start of the game, the G-Man speaks to Gordon Freeman as part of a [[hallucination]]-like vision and is pulled out of stasis. The world has been overtaken by aliens known as the [[Combine (Half-Life 2)|Combine]]<ref name = "hl2guideI">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/pointinsertion_40/ | title = Chapter I: Point Insertion | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Gordon meets up with [[Barney Calhoun]] and sets for [[Doctor Isaac Kleiner]]'s lab while being chased by Civil Protection. Gordon eventually meets [[Alyx Vance]] and is taken to Doctor Kleiner's lab. At the lab, an attempt to teleport Alyx to [[Black Mesa East]] works, but the teleporter fails for Gordon and alerts the Combine of Gordon's arrival to [[City 17]]. Barney instructs Gordon to take the city's canals to get to Eli's lab<ref name = "hl2guideII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/redletterday_41/ | title = Chapter II: Red Letter Day | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

While navigating the city's canals, Gordon is chased by the Combine on foot until being outfitted with an [[air boat]] at a rebel outpost <ref name = "hl2guideIII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/routekanal_42/ | title = Chapter III: Route Kanal | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. However, the air boat is soon spotted by the Combine and pursued by a [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Hunter-chopper|hunter-chopper]] assault [[helicopter]]. Using a salvaged [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Overwatch Hunter-Chopper Turret|Overwatch hunter-chopper turret]], Gordon manages to take down the pursing helicopter<ref name = "hl2guideIV">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/waterhazard_33/ | title = Chapter IV: Water Hazard | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. He arrives at [[Black Mesa East]] and meets [[Doctor Eli Vance]] and [[Judith Mossman|Doctor Judith Mossman]], as well as rejoining Alyx. Alyx gives him a tool originally developed for handling hazardous materials called the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Gravity Gun|Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator]] (also known as the ''gravity gun'') and instructs Gordon on its use while also introducing [[Dog (Half-Life 2)|Dog]], a giant "pet" robot. The lab is attacked by the Combine, forcing Gordon to escape along an old tunnel leading to [[Ravenholm]]<ref name = "hl2guideV">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/bmeast_34/ | title = Chapter V: Black Mesa East | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

[[Image:Antlions1HL2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A group of [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)|Antlions]] attacking Gordon.]]

A Combine shelling caused Ravenholm to be overrun with headcrabs and zombies, with [[Father Grigori]] as the last human resident of Ravenholm. Grigori helps Gordon through Ravenholm and ultimately leads him to the dockyards outside City 17<ref name = "hl2guideVI">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/ravenholm_38/ | title = Chapter VI: We Don't Go To Ravenholm | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Freeman is alerted by Alyx through radio that Eli has been captured and is being held in [[Nova Prospekt]]<ref name = "hl2guideVII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/highway17_46/ | title = Chapter VII: Highway 17 | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Freeman travels to Nova Prospekt with a [[dune buggy]], helping down a [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Gunship|Combine gunship]] after meeting [[Colonel]] [[Odessa Cubbage]] at another resistance base, who gives him an [[Rocket propelled grenade|RPG]] launcher. The journey is made more difficult due to [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)|Antlion]]s and an [[Antlion Guard#Antlion Guards|Antlion Guard]]. A vortigaunt extracts a ''[[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Antlion Pheropod (Bugbait)|pheropod]]'' from the corpse and gives it to Gordon, allowing him to command them<ref name = "hl2guideVIII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/sandtraps_47/ | title = Chapter VIII: Sandtraps | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

At Nova Prospekt, Freeman searches for Eli<ref name = "hl2guideIX">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/novaprospekt_36/ | title = Chapter IX: Nova Prospekt | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Alyx joins with Gordon again, and together they find both Eli and Doctor Judith Mossman (now discovered to be a Combine spy). Mossman creates a distraction and teleports herself and Eli into the [[List of Combine non-combat technology in Half-Life 2#The Citadel|Citadel]], while Gordon and Alyx teleport themselves to Doctor Kleiner's lab. A malfunction in the equipment causes them to arrive at Doctor Kleiner's lab a week after they teleported<ref name = "hl2guideX">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/entanglement_48/ | title = Chapter X: Entanglement | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. During this lost week, the resistance has considerably strengthened. Gordon leads fighters towards the Citadel to free Doctor Vance while Alyx helps Doctor Kleiner escape the lab. Later, Alyx briefly rejoins and accompanies Gordon in a battle to disable a Combine power generator, but she is subsequently captured by Combine forces<ref name = "hl2guideXI">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/anticitizenone_53/ | title = Chapter XI: Anticitizen One | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. After reaching Barney, Gordon shuts down a [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Suppression device|suppression device]] blocking access to the Citadel and brings down a pack of [[List of humanoid and synthetic Combine in Half-Life 2#Strider|Striders]]<ref name = "hl2guideXII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/followfreeman_51/ | title = Chapter XII: Follow Freeman | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

[[Image:800px-City17HL2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Resistance fighters help Gordon take down a strider.]]

Gordon enters the Citadel through an underground passage. All of his weapons are destroyed or removed by a "confiscation field", save the gravity gun. The field instead strengthens the gravity gun, and using this Gordon wreaks havoc upon the Citadel<ref name = "hl2guideXIII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/ourbenefactors_50/ | title = Chapter XIII: Our Benefactors | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Freeman enters a containment apparatus, which brings him face-to-face with Doctor Breen. Doctor Judith Mossman is with Breen, and he summons Eli and Alyx, who are being held in similar devices. As Breen threatens the Vances, Judith finally turns against him. Breen manages to escape to a "Dark Energy Reactor" at the top of the Citadel with the intent of teleporting him away from Earth. Gordon and Alyx pursue him, and Gordon destroys the reactor, both to depower the Citadel and to prevent Breen's escape. This triggers a massive explosion in which Alyx and Gordon are imperiled.<ref name = "hl2guideXIV">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/darkenergy_39/ | title = Chapter XIV: Dark Energy | work = Half-Life Fallout | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> The story continues from this point in ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]''.

{{endspoiler}}

=== Narration ===

Throughout the entire game, Freeman [[Silent protagonist|never speaks]], and the action is viewed through his eyes only (i.e., there are no [[cut scene]]s).

There has been some complaint<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/review.html?page=1 | title = Half-Life 2 for PC Review | work = GameSpot | accessdate = October 10 | accessyear = 2005}}</ref> about these narrative holdovers from ''[[Half-Life]]'', since they effectively limit how much of the [[backstory]] is explained. Due to the lack of cut scenes, the player never directly sees what has happened in Gordon's absence. Ultimately, it's not clear to what extent Gordon exists as a separate character outside of the player's influence. Since the start of ''Half-Life'', Valve has made sure that the player's and Gordon's experience are one and the same. An example of Valve's player strategy is shown during the scene in Eli's lab. Investigation of certain props (most notably the newspaper board) triggers Eli to give some explanation to their meaning and history, thus indicating that Gordon presents emotions that the NPCs can detect<ref name = hl2guideV />. These minor events may have been included to mirror the player's possible sense of curiosity, thus further merging the identities of Gordon and the player. Some of the [[Vortigaunt#"The All-Knowing Vortigaunt"|All-Knowing Vortigaunt]]'s enigmatic comments in the game seem to indicate this concurrent-identity phenomenon.  

The ending of ''Half-Life 2'' is also very similar to that of the original: after completing a difficult task against seemingly overwhelming odds, Gordon is extracted by the G-Man. Freeman is smugly congratulated and told that further assignments should follow. The fate of many of the major characters, such as Alyx, Eli, and Judith, go unexplained. Very few, if any, of the questions raised by ''Half-Life'' are answered, and instead several new ones are presented. The identity and nature of the G-Man remains a mystery.

=== Setting ===

[[Image:800px-Metrocop GScott.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A Civil Protection officer attacking Gordon. In the background is an example of the cityscape showing the Eastern European style, mixed with elements of Combine architecture.]]
The environments in ''Half-Life 2'' are varied, ranging from the Eastern European-styled [[City 17]] and surrounding areas, to the massive Combine Citadel. There is a general Eastern European "feel" present throughout the human-populated areas, and several hints indicate that City 17 is based on [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]], the hometown of the art director of ''Half-Life 2'', Viktor Antonov. Antonov wrote that Eastern Europe was favored as a setting for the game as it is capable of depicting a combination of both new and old architecture, creating a city with history; "gothic themes associated with [[Prague]] and [[vampire]]s" were also overlooked in favor of a different aspect of the region<ref name="raisebar" />.

City 17 has both a general resemblance to Sofia as well as frequent appearance of Bulgarian words (written in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]]) on signs and [[graffiti]] throughout the game (although some of these are words in other [[Slavic languages]] as well). One clear example is ''"<U+0446><U+0438><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442>"'' ("cement") written across the top of some large buildings in Ravenholm and City 17 - the only language that spells this word in this way, using the Cyrillic alphabet, is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. Many old cars scattered throughout the game are similar to ones commonly found in Eastern Europe, such as [[Moskvitch]]s, [[Trabant]]s and [[Volga (automobile)|Volga]]s.  Also, during the game, Gordon comes to a Resistance settlement called "New Little Odessa." [[Odessa]] is a major city located on the coast of [[Ukraine]], approximately 500 miles from Sofia.

[[Father Grigori]] has a name common to Eastern European countries and an [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]] that is [[stereotype|stereotypically]] Eastern European. The naming of City 17 itself is similar to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] practice of numbering secret [[Closed city|closed cities]] rather than naming them. However, in addition to incorporating Eastern European elements, examples of [[Norway|Norwegian]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[Romania]]n, [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[France|French]] influences also exist, suggesting that the setting is something of a [[montage]] of [[Europe]]an locations.

== Gameplay ==

[[Image:800px-Half-Life 2.jpg|left|thumb|251px|Navigating through the canals on the [[air boat]], Gordon comes under attack from a Combine [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Hunter-chopper|hunter-chopper]].]]

''Half-Life 2'''s gameplay is broadly similar to that of the original. Players make their way through a linear series of levels, encountering both human troops and hostile alien creatures. As in ''Half-Life'', the gameplay is broken up with a series of puzzles; however, ''Half-Life 2'' includes physics-based puzzles. For example, one puzzle requires the player to turn a [[seesaw]]-like [[lever]] into a ramp by placing [[cinder block]]s at one end.

The use of physics extends into combat with the gravity gun. This unique weapon plays a crucial function throughout the game, granting the player an unprecedented amount of creativity in its use, such as picking up and throwing objects at enemies, holding objects indefinitely for use as makeshift shields, grabbing health and ammunition from out of reach places, returning enemies' [[hand grenade|grenades]], building makeshift bridges, or manipulating objects through [[List of Combine non-combat technology in Half-Life 2#Forcefield generators|Combine forcefields]].

[[Vehicle]]s are another major gameplay addition. The player has the ability to drive two vehicles during the single player campaign; an [[air boat]], which Gordon uses to navigate through the canal network, and a [[dune buggy]] which Gordon uses to get to Nova Prospekt. The air boat is initially unarmed, but is later mounted with a Combine weapon from a downed [[List of Combine combat technology in Half-Life 2#Hunter-chopper|hunter-chopper]]. The buggy is armed with a [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Tau Cannon (Gauss Gun)|Gauss Gun]] similar to the one found in the original ''Half-Life''.

The game also integrates [[Tutorial#Computing|tutorial]]-like tasks in the storyline itself (but no longer includes separate tutorial levels featured in the original) to allow familiarization of the game's mechanics and weapons for players as they go. Several such examples include an early incident in game where a Civil Protection unit orders the player to "pick up" a tin can and "throw it" in the trash can, and Alyx Vance's introduction of the gravity gun at Black Mesa East.

=== Characters and creatures ===

Although Gordon battles through much of ''Half-Life 2'' alone, he is assisted at times in several places by friendly allies. For the most part these are human members of the resistance, but Gordon is also helped by [[vortigaunt]]s and later [[Antlion (Half-Life 2)|Antlions]]. This latter [[insect]]oid species is new to ''Half-Life 2'' and is encountered first as a fiercely territorial foe, but is later co-opted into acting as an abundant and obedient ally. At several key locations, Gordon also meets up with, and fights alongside, more significant [[non-player character]]s like [[Alyx Vance]], [[Barney Calhoun]] and Alyx's robot, [[Dog (Half-Life 2)|Dog]].

Many familiar enemies from ''Half-Life'' return in this game, such as [[headcrab]]s, [[Barnacle (Half-Life)|barnacles]], and headcrab [[zombie]]s. However, the majority of the game is spent fighting the [[Combine (Half-Life 2)|Combine]], who wield large military forces against Gordon and the people of City 17. Combine forces are varied and consist of [[Combine (Half-Life 2)#Humanoid Combine|modified humans]], [[Combine (Half-Life 2)#Combine synths|biomechanical machines]], and [[Combine (Half-Life 2)#Combine combat tech|robotic weapons]].

=== Weapons ===
{{main|List of weapons in Half-Life 2}}

Several of the weapons featured in ''Half-Life 2'' are carried over from ''Half-Life'', including the trademark [[crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] for m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e fighting, the conventional [[firearm]]s of the [[Franchi SPAS-12|SPAS-12]] [[shotgun]], [[.357 Magnum]] [[revolver]], [[crossbow]], and [[rocket propelled grenade]] launcher as well as the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Tau Cannon (Gauss Gun)|Gauss Gun]] experimental particle weapon. Several new weapons are also introduced: the Combine [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle .28AR2.29|pulse rifle]], pheropods which grant control over Antlions, and most significantly, the "[[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Gravity Gun|Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator]]" (or gravity gun).

=== Multiplayer ===

''Half-Life 2'' was released without a multiplayer component of the game and was instead packaged with ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]''. This later changed on [[November 30]], [[2004]] when Valve released the ''Half-Life 2: [[Deathmatch (gaming)|Deathmatch]]'' component (''HL2DM'') along with the full [[Software development kit|SDK]] as a free download to all ''Half-Life 2'' owners.

Like other deathmatch games, the aim of ''Half-Life 2: Deathmatch'' is to kill as many other players as possible, using a variety of means, in either free-for-all or team matches. The player [[Spawning (computer gaming)|spawns]] with a [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Gravity Gun|gravity gun]], a [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#USP Match 9mm|pistol]], a [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#MP7A1 Submachine Gun|sub-machine gun]], and [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Fragmentation Grenade|grenades]]. All weapons included in the single player portion of ''Half-Life 2'', with the exception of the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Pheropod ("Bug Bait")|pheropod/bugbait]], are available and scattered randomly around the maps. Players can be killed in a number of ways, including gunfire, explosions, or through contact with physics objects traveling at high speeds. The physics elements of the game are of particular note as they help to make the gameplay more dynamic and interesting as the layout of the levels frequently change due to the physics objects being moved about.

''HL2DM'''s [[February 17]] update introduced a new map (''dm_steamlab'') and three new weapons that had been missing from the game previously, or cut before it shipped. This included the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Crowbar|crowbar]] and the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Stunstick|stunstick]] (dependent upon the player model); and the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition .28SLAM.29|SLAM]], or "Selectable Lightweight Attack Munition", a real-world weapon which can either be thrown and detonated or planted on walls to produce a "[[tripwire]]" laser which detonates the device when touched.

== Reception ==

''Half-Life 2'''s public reception was overwhelmingly positive in terms of reviews, acclaim and sales. Over four million copies of the game have been sold either through Steam or through retail <ref name = episode1webpage />. This is around half the number of sold copies of ''[[Half-Life]]'', but sales for ''Half-Life 2'' have been relatively steady since its release. If ''Half-Life 2'' eventually surpasses ''Half-Life'' in sales, it will take the title of the best-selling [[first-person shooter]] game to date.

=== Critical response ===

''Half-Life 2'' became and remains one of the most highly acclaimed video games in history. At least 35 Game of the Year awards were given to ''Half-Life 2'', and most major game reviewers gave ratings within the 90-100% range <ref name = reviews2 />. ''Half-Life 2'' holds [[Metacritic]]'s highest ranking and standing ("universal acclaim") among PC games with a score of 96, followed directly by ''Half-Life'' (also with a score of 96) <ref name = metacritic />. ''[[Maximum PC]]'' awarded ''Half-Life 2'' an unprecedented 11 on their rating scale which peaks at 10, and named it the "best game ever made."

Individual reviews were almost universally glowing. Sources such as [[GameSpy]] <ref name="gamespyreview">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2/566585p1.html | title = Half-Life 2 review | work = GameSpy | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' <ref name = "cincin">{{cite web | url = http://www.cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/120204_half-life2.html | title = Half-Life 2: A Tech Masterpiece | work = Cincinnati Enquirer | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' <ref name="nytreview">{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/25/technology/circuits/25game.html?ex=1102400752&ei=1&en=e3a5cf6f48defd10 | title = A Big Sequel That's Worthy of Its Lineage | work = The New York Times | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> have given perfect reviewing scores, and others such as ''[[PC Gamer]]'' and [[IGN]] <ref name = "ignreview">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/566/566202p1.html | title = Half-Life 2 Review | work = IGN | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> gave near-perfect scores. Critics who applauded the game cited the advanced graphics and physics <ref name = nytreview /> along with the relatively lax system requirements <ref name = "gameproreview">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com.au/index.php/id;1181166017;fp;2;fpid;36 | title = Half-Life 2 - Australian Review (Reviews) | work = GamePro | accessdate = May 21 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

Very few reviewers gave ''Half-Life 2'' anything lower than a 9 out of 10 rating. One such critic was [[Netjak]], a reviewing website that is known for its relative harshness, which gave ''Half-Life 2'' a rating of 8.5 <ref name = "dontbehatingonhl">{{cite web | url = http://www.netjak.com/review.php/780 | title = Half-Life 2 - Windows Review | work = Netjak | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. Several critics, including some that had given glowing reviews, complained about the required usage of Steam along with a difficult installation process <ref name = nytreview />.

=== Products ===

The popularity of ''Half-Life 2'' and the ''Half-Life'' series has led way to an array of side products and collectibles. [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] offers ''Half-Life''-related products such as a [[plush]] [[headcrab]]<ref name="cuteheadcrab">{{cite web | url = http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_HL2HeadCrabPlush.html | title = HL2 Headcrab Collectible | work = Valve Corporation | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>, posters, clothing and mousepads <ref name="valvestore">{{cite web | url = http://store.valvesoftware.com/index.html | title = The Valve Store | work = Valve Corporation | accessdate = May 20 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>.

== Technical ==
=== Game engine ===
{{main|Source engine}}

For ''Half-Life 2'', [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] developed a new [[game engine]] called the ''[[Source engine]]'', which handles the game's visual, audio, and [[artificial intelligence]] elements. The Source engine comes packaged with a heavily modified version of the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics engine]] that allows for an extra dimension of interactivity in both single player and online environments.

Additionally, when coupled with [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]], the engine can be easily upgraded to include many new graphical technologies. One such example is [[high dynamic range imaging]], which Valve released as a 15-minute free outdoor level called ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]''.

=== Steam content delivery system ===
{{main|Steam (content delivery)}}

[[Image:steam3beta.PNG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam content delivery system]] version 3 user interface]]
Integral to ''Half-Life 2'' is the [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] content delivery system developed by Valve Corporation. All ''Half-Life 2'' players are required to have Steam installed and a valid account in order to play. Steam allows customers to purchase games and other software straight from the developer and have it downloaded directly to their computer as well as receiving "micro updates." These updates also make [[hack]]ing the game harder to do and has thus far been somewhat successful in staving off [[Cheating in online games|cheats]] and playability for users with [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copies]]. Steam can also be used for finding and playing multi-player games through an integrated server browser and friends list, and game data can be backed up with a standard CD or DVD burner. Steam and a customer's purchased content can be downloaded onto any computer, as long as that account is only logged in at one location at a time.

The usage of Steam has not gone without controversy. Some users have reported numerous problems with Steam, sometimes being serious enough to prevent a reviewer from recommending a given title available on the service. In other cases, review scores have been lowered. Long [[download]] times, seemingly unnecessary updates, and verification checks are criticisms leveled by critics of the system's use for single player games such as ''Half-Life 2''. Whether or not a customer intends to use any multi-player features, the computer the game was installed on must have Steam and an [[Internet]] connection to verify the transaction.

=== Release and distribution ===

A 1[[gigabyte|GB]] portion of ''Half-Life 2'' became available for pre-load through Steam on August 26, 2004. This meant that customers could begin to download encrypted game files to their computer before the game was released. When the game's release date arrived, customers were able to pay for the game through Steam, unlock the files on their hard drives and play the game immediately, without having to wait for the whole game to download. The pre-load period lasted for several weeks, with several subsequent portions of the game being made available, to ensure all customers had a chance to download the content before the game was released.

''Half-Life 2'' was simultaneously released through Steam, [[Compact disc|CD]] (most initial U.S. "bare-bones" retail copies), and on [[DVD]] in several editions. Through Steam, ''Half-Life 2'' had  three packages that a customer could order. The basic version ("Bronze") includes only ''Half-Life 2'' and ''Counter-Strike: Source'', whereas the "Silver" and "Gold" (collector's edition) versions also include ''[[Half-Life#Later developments|Half-Life: Source]]'' and ''[[Day of Defeat: Source]]'' (ports of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Day of Defeat'' mod to the new engine) as well as the right to download all previous games by Valve through Steam. The collector's edition/Gold version additionally includes merchandise such as a [[t-shirt]], a [[strategy guide]], and a CD containing the soundtrack used in ''Half-Life 2''. Both the disc and Steam version require Steam to be installed and active for play.

====Subsequent releases====
A [[Demoware|demo]] version with the file size of a single-[[Compact Disc|CD]] was later made available in December 2004 at the web site of [[graphics card]] manufacturer [[ATI Technologies]], who teamed up with Valve for the game. The demo contains part of the opening level of the game, and also part of the chapter "We Don't Go To Ravenholm." In September 2005, [[Electronic Arts]] distributed the ''Game of the Year'' edition of ''Half-Life 2''. Compared to the original CD-release of ''Half-Life 2'', the ''GOTY'' edition adds ''Half-Life: Source''.

On December 22, 2005, Valve released a [[64-bit]] version of the Source game engine that takes advantage of [[AMD64]] processor based systems running [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|64-bit version of Windows]] [[operating system]]. This update, delivered via Steam, enabled ''Half-Life 2'' and other Source-based games to run natively on AMD64 processors, bypassing the [[WOW64|32-bit emulator]]. [[Gabe Newell]], one of the founders of Valve, stated that this is "an important step in the evolution of our game content and tools," and that the game benefits greatly from the update<ref name="amd64">{{cite web | url = http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&id=496 | title= VALVE UNVEILS 64-BIT SOURCE(TM) GAMING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AMD | work = Steam Powered | accessdate = March 23 | accessyear= 2006}}</ref>. The response to the release varied: some users reported huge performance boosts, while technology site [[Techgage]] found several stability issues and no notable frame rate improvement<ref name="techgage">{{cite web | url = http://techgage.com/review.php?id=3889 | title= Review: Half-Life 2: 64-Bit - Reason to get excited? | work = Techgage | accessdate = March 23 | accessyear= 2006}}</ref>. 64-bit users have widely reported bizarre in-game errors including characters dropping dead, game script files not being pre-cached (i.e., loaded when first requested instead), map rules being bent by AI, and other glitches.

An [[Xbox]] version published by Electronic Arts was released on November 15, 2005 but does not feature any [[multiplayer]] components. Additionally, next generation console ports of the game (specifically the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]) were said to be under consideration in 2003, but no official announcement has been made regarding the ports to date<ref name="nextgen">{{cite web | url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/607/607306p1.html | title = Half-Life 2 on PS3 | work = IGN | accessdate = April 19 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>. It is also worth noting that the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports of the game were recently listed on the [[Electronics Boutique]] website, which indicated that the ports will be shipped simultaneously on [[February 5]], [[2007]]<ref name="nextgenxb360">[http://www.ebgames.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=200198 ''Half-Life 2'' (Xbox 360 version)] at Electronics Boutique.

== Mods and expansions ==

[[Image:750px-Hl2 lostcoast menu.jpg|250px|thumb|''Half-Life 2: Lost Coast'', showcasing Valve's [[high dynamic range imaging|HDR]] technology.]]
{{main articles|[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]], [[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]], [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]], [[Half-Life 2: Episode Three|Episode Three]], and [[List of Half-Life 2 mods|Half-Life 2 mods]]}}
Since the release of ''Half-Life 2'', Valve has released an additional level and an additional "expansion" sequel. The level, "[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]," takes place between the levels "Highway 17" and "Sandtraps" and is primarily a showcase for [[high dynamic range imaging]] (HDR) technology. The "expansion" sequel, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' takes place shortly after the events of ''Half-Life 2'', with the player taking on the role of Gordon Freeman once again and with Alyx Vance playing a more prominent role. Additionally, two further "episodes" are set to be released in the future, dubbed ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Three|Episode Three]]''; the latter being the last expansion, "in a trilogy".<ref name="ep2.ep3.confirmation">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2aftermath/news.html?sid=6151796l | title = Half-Life 2: Episode One gold, Two dated, Three announced | work = GameSpot | accessdate = May 25 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref> In an interview with [[Eurogamer]], Gabe Newell revealed that the ''Half-Life 2'' "episodes" are essentially ''Half-Life 3''. He reasons that rather than forcing fans to wait another six years for a full-on sequel, Valve would release the game in episodic installments. Newell admits that a more correct title for these episodes should have been "''Half-Life 3: Episode One''" and so forth, having referred to the episodes as ''Half-Life 3'' repeatedly through the interview.<ref name="eps.are.halflife3">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=65345&page=1 | title = Interview - Opening the Valve | work = Eurogamer | accessdate = June 7 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref>

Since the release of the Source engine SDK, a large number of [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] have been developed by the ''Half-Life 2'' community. Mods vary in scale, from fan-created levels and weapons, to partial conversions such as [[GMod|Garry's Mod]] which allow the player to experiment with the physics system in a [[sandbox (videogames)|sandbox]] mode, to [[mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversion]]s such as ''[[Dystopia (computer game)|Dystopia]]'' or ''[[Empires]]'', that transforms the game from a first-person shooter into a real-time strategy game. Some mods take place in the ''Half-Life'' universe; others in completely original settings; while some are tributes to other games, such as ''[[GoldenEye: Source]]'', a recreation of ''[[GoldenEye 007]]'', or ''Resident Evil: Twilight''. Many more mods are still in development, including ''[[Neotokyo]]'' and the [[episodic games|episodic]] single player mod, ''[[MINERVA (mod)|MINERVA]]''.

Valve's ''Half-Life: Source'' was a direct conversion of the original game to the Source engine. ''[[Black Mesa (game mod)|Black Mesa]]'', originally named ''Black Mesa: Source'', is an unofficial mod under development which takes the more ambitious route of attempting to fully recreate the original ''Half-Life'' from the ground up using improved graphical assets and effects, while maintaining the original storyline and [[level design]].

== Cuts ==
{{main|Content cut from Half-Life 2}}

The book ''Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar''<ref name="raisebar" /> revealed many of the game's original settings and action that were cut down or removed entirely from the final game. ''Half-Life 2'' was originally intended to be a far darker game where the Combine were more obviously draining the oceans for minerals and replacing the atmosphere with noxious, murky gases. [[Nova Prospekt]] was originally intended to be a small Combine rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland (the depot model remains in the game, visible from the beach and trash compactor). Eventually, Nova Prospekt grew and grew from a stopping-off point along the way to the destination itself.

''Half-Life 2'' was also originally intended to be much more diverse in settings. Parts of the book detail how Gordon would fight alongside characters such as [[Odessa Cubbage]], albeit under a different name and in a different place, as well as fighting together with Colonel Vance - a character that was later merged with Eli to become [[Doctor Eli Vance]] - and Vance's forces. In addition, the player was to follow a vastly different journey than what is in the final release.

Other cuts from the game included a drivable [[personal water craft]] and additional weapons. Weapons cut included the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#XM29 OICW|OICW]] seen in an [[E3]] demonstration video and two different models of the [[List of weapons in Half-Life 2#Manipulator (Physgun)|gravity gun]] or Physgun, which is seen in another E3 video, also depicting a level cut from [[Ravenholm]], dubbed "Traptown."

It remains unknown if most of the cut ''Half-Life 2'' scenes will eventually be completed and released, or if they are lost forever. A removed section of the original ''Half-Life'' was eventually released as the ''[[Half-Life: Uplink]]'' demo; a similar situation was in place with the HDR [[technology demo]], ''Lost Coast'', which was based on a scene that was cut from the sequel. It is possible that more removed sections of ''HL2'' will be seen in future [[expansion pack]]s.

Some of the cut content which appeared in the leaked betas is available in a work-in-progress mod called ''[http://pubtub.love-tub.com/ Missing Information]''. In addition to several cut weapons, the mod also includes a level set on the stranded [[icebreaker]] ''Borealis'' and the E3 demonstrations. This mod has not been sanctioned by Valve, and official permission has not been given for the redistribution of modified versions of the original leaked material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halflife2.net/forums/showpost.php?p=1894673&postcount=127|accessdate=April 22, 2006|work=Halflife2.net|title=Mod developer's post}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
All listed tracks have been composed by Kelly Bailey. Purchasers of the collector's edition of the game were given (among other things) a CD soundtrack containing nearly all the music from the game, along with three bonus tracks. This CD is not available for separate purchase.
<br>''(Note: Many of the tracks were retitled and carried over from the ''[[Half-Life]]'' soundtrack; The names in parentheses are the original titles. Tracks 32, 34, 41, and 42 are remixes.)''

Tracks 16, 18 and 42 are bonus tracks that are exclusive to the CD soundtrack. Tracks 44 to 51 are tracks from the game that did not appear on the soundtrack CD.
