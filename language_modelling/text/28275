A '''circulation control wing''' (CCW) is a form of [[High-lift device]] for use on the main wing of an aircraft to increase the [[lift coefficient]]. CCW technology has been in the research and development phase for over sixty years, and the early models were called [[Blown flaps]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/2005-01-3192 |title=Circulation Control Wing |accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> 

The CCW works by increasing the velocity of the airflow over the [[leading edge]] and [[trailing edge]] of a specially designed aircraft [[wing]] using a series of blowing slots that eject high pressure jet air. The wing has a rounded trailing edge to tangentially eject the air through the [[Coanda]] effect thus causing lift.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMFLC06_1187/PV2006_3011.pdf |title=Large Eddy Simulation of a Circulation Control Airfoil. |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Slomski |first=J.F. |coauthors= |date=2006-06-05|format=PDF}}</ref> The increase in [[velocity]] of the airflow over the wing also adds to the lift force through conventional [[airfoil]] lift production.<ref name="cc">{{cite book |title=FlightWise |last=Carpenter |first=Chris |year=1996 |publisher=Airlife Publishing Ltd |location= UK |}}</ref>

== Purpose ==
 
The main purpose of the circulation control wing is to increase the [[lifting force]] of an aircraft at times when large lifting forces at slow speeds are required, such as [[takeoff]] and [[landing]]. Wing [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and [[slats]] are currently used during landing on almost all aircraft and on takeoff by larger jets. While flaps and slats are effective in increasing lift, they do so at a high cost of drag.<ref name="cc" /> The benefit of the circulation control wing is that no extra drag is created and the lift coefficient is greatly increased. It is being claimed that such a system could increase the landing coefficient of lift of a [[Boeing 737]] by 150% to 250%, thus reducing approach speeds by 35% to 45% and landing distances by 55% to 75% and that such advances in wing design could allow for dramatic wing size reduction in large, wide body jets.<ref  name="cc" />

== Other uses ==
===== Increased maneuverability =====

At low speeds, an aircraft has reduced airflow over the [[wing]] and [[vertical stabiliser]]. This causes the [[control surfaces]] ([[ailerons]], [[elevators]] and [[rudder]]) to be less effective. The CCW system increases the airflow over these surfaces and consequently can allow much higher manoeuvrability at low speeds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2007/april-may/custer_channel_wing.php?page=2|title=Circulation Control Technology|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> However, if one of the CCW systems should fail at low speed, the affected wing is likely to [[stall (flight)|stall]] which could result in an inescapable [[spin (flight)|spin]]. Finally, the CCW system could be used on multi-engine aircraft in the result of an engine failure to cancel the [[asymmetric forces]] from the loss of power on one wing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2007/april-may/custer_channel_wing.php?page=2|title=Circulation Control Technology|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref>

===== Noise reduction =====

The use of a CCW system eliminates the need for large complex components in the free stream such as [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and [[slats]], greatly reducing the [[noise pollution]] of modern aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMFLC06_1187/PV2006_3011.pdf |title=Large Eddy Simulation of a Circulation Control Airfoil. |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Slomski |first=J.F. |coauthors= |date=2006-06-05|format=PDF}}</ref> Additionally, a much shorter ground roll coupled with steeper climb outs and approaches reduces the ground noise footprint. The blowing slots themselves will contribute very little to the noise of the aircraft as each slot is just a fraction of an inch wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2007/april-may/custer_channel_wing.php?page=2|title=Circulation Control Technology|accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref>

== Powering the wing ==

The main problem with the circulation control wing is the need for high energy air to be blown over the wing's surface. Such air is often taken from the engine however this drastically reduces engine power production and consequently defies the purpose of the wing. Other options are taking the exhaust gases (which must first be cooled) or using multiple, lightweight gas generators, which are separate from the main aircraft engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/2005-01-3192 |title=Circulation Control Wing |accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref>
