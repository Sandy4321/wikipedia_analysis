Together with [[Quebec Autoroute 20]], it forms the transportation backbone of the [[Quebec City<U+2013>Windsor Corridor]], along which over half of Canada's population resides.
The entire route is maintained by the [[Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] (MTO) and patrolled by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]. The posted [[Speed limits in Canada|speed limit]] is {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} throughout its length.

Three individual highways were renumbered "Highway&nbsp;401" by the end of 1952: the Toronto Bypass between [[Weston Road]] and [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]] (Yonge Street); [[Ontario Highway 2A|Highway&nbsp;2A]] between [[West Hill, Ontario|West Hill]] and [[Newcastle, Ontario|Newcastle]]; and the Scenic Highway between [[Gananoque, Ontario|Gananoque]] and [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]], now known as the [[Thousand Islands Parkway]]. These three sections of highway were {{convert|11.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|54.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|41.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, respectively, at the time of their assumption to provincial highway status. Highway&nbsp;401 became fully navigable from Windsor to the Quebec border in 1964. The following year, it was given a second designation, the Macdonald<U+2013>Cartier Freeway, in honour of the [[fathers of Confederation]]. By the end of 1968, the Gananoque<U+2013>Brockville section was bypassed and the final intersection [[grade-separated]] near [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], making Highway&nbsp;401 a freeway for its entire 817.9-km length. On August 24, 2007, the portion of the highway between Glen Miller Road in [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] and the [[Don Valley Parkway]]&nbsp;/ [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway&nbsp;404]] Junction in Toronto was designated the '''Highway of Heroes''', as the road is travelled by funeral convoys for fallen [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Forces personnel]] from [[CFB Trenton]] to the coroner's office in Toronto.

In 2011 construction began on a westward extension of Highway&nbsp;401 that will be known as the Windsor<U+2013>Essex Parkway. This new route will generally follow, but not replace, former [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] between the current end of the freeway and the [[E. C. Row Expressway]], at which point it will turn and follow that route to a [[Detroit River International Crossing|new border crossing]]. However, this new bridge has yet to be approved by the Michigan Senate.

Elsewhere in Ontario, plans are underway to widen the remaining four lane sections between Windsor and [[London, Ontario|London]] to six lanes and to widen the route between [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] and [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]] as well as through [[Oshawa]]. The expansive twelve-plus lane [[local-express lanes|collector<U+2013>express system]] will also be extended west through [[Mississauga]] to Milton and east through [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]] and [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]].

Highway&nbsp;401's history predates its designation by over two decades. As automobile use in southern Ontario grew in the early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. Following frequent erosion of Lake Shore Road, then [[macadamized]],<ref name="Burlington">Emery pp. 179<U+2013>182.</ref>
a cement road known as the ''Toronto<U+2013>Hamilton Highway'' was proposed in January 1914. Construction began on November&nbsp;8 of that year, following the onset of [[World War I]].<ref name="MFiley">{{cite news

The highway was designed to run along the lake shore, instead of [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs.<ref name="FtF55">Shragge p. 55.</ref>
The road was formally opened on November 24, 1917,<ref name="Burlington" /><ref name="MFiley" /> {{convert|5.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and nearly {{convert|64|km|abbr=on}} long. It was the first concrete road in Ontario, as well as one of the longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in the world.<ref>Shragge p. 55. "''...the Toronto-to-Hamilton highway which, when completed in 1917, was both Ontario's first concrete highway and one of the longest such inter-city stretches in the world.''"</ref>

Following the war, construction resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa was completed in December 1947,<ref name="FtF93" /> while other sections languished. The Toronto<U+2013>Barrie Highway was the primary focus of the Department of Highways at the time, and the onset of the [[Korean War]] in 1950 stalled construction again. Despite the delays, highway minister George Doucette officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving as a model for the design.<ref name="JShragge" /> Work on the most important link, the ''Toronto Bypass'', began in 1951,<ref name="JShragge" /> but it would not open with that name.

Upon its opening, the bypass was described by one reporter as "a motorist's dream" providing "some of the most soothing scenery in the Metropolitan area".

In Toronto, engineers and surveyors were examining the four-lane bypass, while planners set about designing a way to handle the commuter highway. In 1963, transportation minister Charles MacNaughton announced the widening of Highway&nbsp;401 in Toronto from four to a minimum of 12&nbsp;lanes between [[List of north<U+2013>south roads in Toronto#Islington Avenue|Islington Avenue]] and [[Ontario Highway 48|Markham Road]]. The design was taken from the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] in Chicago, which was widened into a similar configuration around the same time.<ref name="FtF93" /> Construction began immediately. While the plan initially called for construction to end in 1967, it continued for nearly a decade. At least four lanes were always open during the large reconstruction project, which included complex new interchanges at Highway&nbsp;27, Highway&nbsp;400, the planned Spadina Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. The system was completed in 1972, along with the Highway&nbsp;27 bypass north of Highway&nbsp;401. Most of the interchanges in Toronto were reconstructed as [[Parclo A4|partial cloverleafs]] and a continuous lighting system was installed.<ref name="JShragge" />

On January 11, 1965, at the dinner celebration of [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]'s 150th birthday, [[John Robarts]] designated Highway&nbsp;401 the ''Macdonald<U+2013>Cartier Freeway'' to honour Macdonald and [[George-<U+00C9>tienne Cartier]], two of Canada's [[Canadian Confederation|Fathers of Confederation]].<ref>{{cite news

In 1993, the stretch of Highway&nbsp;401 eastbound near [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]] and westbound near [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]] had chevrons painted in each lane in an effort to reduce [[tailgating]], a concept borrowed from France and Britain. Signs advised motorists to keep at least two chevrons apart, in essence warning them not to follow too closely.<ref>{{cite news

Beginning in 1998, several projects were initiated on Highway&nbsp;401 within Toronto. These included the addition of one lane through the Highway&nbsp;427 interchange in 2005, as well as the resurfacing of the pavement through the city.<ref name="mto" />

=== Advantage I-75 ===
Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway&nbsp;401 and [[Interstate&nbsp;75]] were used for a pilot project named ''Advantage I-75'' to test the reliability and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it would allow a truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.<ref name="AI75">{{cite journal

Following initial tests, MACS was deployed at every inspection station along I-75 from Miami to Detroit and along Highway&nbsp;401 from Windsor to Belleville in 1994.<ref name="AI75" />
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of electronic systems in enforcing freight restrictions without delaying vehicles, while alleviating security fears that such systems could be easily compromised. The concept has since been applied to many parts of Canada, including [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407]]'s electronic tolling system.<ref>{{cite report

=== "Carnage Alley" ===
[[File:Carnage Alley.png|thumb|left|alt="A highway viewed from high above travels into the distance from the bottom-right to the top-left. An overpass allows a road to cross the highway near the bottom of the image. The surroundings are entirely agricultural. On the highway, several dozen vehicles are piled into each other. The middle of the large pileup is smoking."|The 87-vehicle pile up on September 3, 1999]]
The section of Highway&nbsp;401 between Windsor and London has often been referred to as ''Carnage Alley'', in reference to the numerous accidents that have occurred throughout its history. The term became more commonplace following several deadly [[pileup]]s during the 1990s.<ref name="JShragge" /> The narrow and open grass median was an ineffective obstacle in preventing cross-median collisions. The nature of that section of highway, described as largely a straight road with a featureless agricultural landscape, was said to make drivers feel less involved and lose focus on the road. Several accidents resulted from motorists deviating from their lane and losing control of their vehicles.<ref>{{cite journal

The origin of the name can be traced to a June 23, 2007 article in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' by columnist Joe Warmington, in which he interviewed Northumberland photographer Pete Fisher.

In 2004, a joint announcement by the [[federal government of the United States]] and [[Government of Canada]] that a new border crossing would be constructed between [[Detroit]] and Windsor. The [[Detroit River International Crossing]] (DRIC) was formed as a bi-national committee to manage the project.<ref name="DRIC study team">{{cite web

The MTO took advantage of this opportunity to extend Highway&nbsp;401 to the [[international border]] and began an [[environmental assessment]] on the entire project in late 2005.<ref name="DRIC study team"/>
The City of Windsor also hired [[New York City|New York]] traffic consultant [[Sam Schwartz]] to design a parkway to the border. Schwartz's proposal would eventually inspire the DRIC's own design, but his route was not chosen, with the DRIC opting instead to take a northern route.<ref>{{cite news

The centres were originally leased to and operated by several major gasoline distributors; however, those companies have chosen not to renew their leases as the terms end.

Seventeen of the centres along Highway&nbsp;401 will be reconstructed entirely. Two centres that were rebuilt in the late 1990s, specifically Newcastle and Ingersoll, will not be redeveloped at this time. Work on 15 of the 17&nbsp;service centres to be reconstructed began in late 2009 or early 2010. The new service centres, opening in phases beginning in July 2010, feature a [[Canadian Tire]] gas station, an HMSHost-operated convenience store known as "The Market", as well as [[fast food]] brands such as [[Tim Hortons]], [[A&W (Canada)|A&W]] and [[Burger King]].<ref name="SSplans">{{cite news
