"'''Behind These Hazel Eyes'''" is a song by American pop rock singer [[Kelly Clarkson]]. It was written by Clarkson with [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]] and produced by the latter two. It was officially sent to radio stations on April 12, 2005 as the third single of Clarkson's second album ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)|Breakaway]]''. Clarkson considered  "Behind These Hazel Eyes" as one of her favorite songs and she once intended to name ''Breakaway'' after the song. "Behind These Hazel Eyes" is an uptempo pop rock song that incorporates crunchy guitars which are pulsated with driving beats and anthemic choruses; it narrates Clarkson's broken relationship with her ex-boyfriend.

"Behind These Hazel Eyes" received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered the song as a decent follow-up to Clarkson's previous single "[[Since U Been Gone]]." Critics also lauded Clarkson's vocal ability which simmers alongside the steroid-charged musical backdrop that is fun, fast and furious. Commercially, "Behind These Hazel Eyes" was successful in the United States; it peaked at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It also became Clarkson's first song to top the [[Adult Top 40|Adult Pop Songs]] chart. It was certified platinum from [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for selling over one million digital downloads. Elsewhere, the song charted inside the top ten in Austria, Netherlands, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and produced by [[Danyi Deats|Danyi Deats-Barrett]]. The concept of the video was conceived by Clarkson and depicts her as a bride who experiences some dream-like hints that her husband-to-be is having an affair with a brunette ceremony attendee. The music video premiered online at [[MTV]] and it also received heavy rotation at ''[[Total Request Live]]''. The song was performed live by Clarkson at numerous venues, including the [[Breakaway World Tour]] (2006) and the [[All I Ever Wanted Tour]] (2009).

==Background and writing==
In 2004, Clarkson flew to Sweden to collaborate with [[Max Martin]] and [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]] for her album, ''Breakaway''.<ref name="about.com">{{Cite news |url=http://top40.about.com/od/artistsdk/p/maxmartin.htm |title=Max Martin |publisher=[[About.com]].

The songs "[[Since U Been Gone]]" as well as "Behind These Hazel Eyes" were the products of their collaboration.<ref name="about.com"/> In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]],'' Clarkson explains that "Behind These Hazel Eyes" is "about the dipstick who completely screwed up and now is unhappy and you're happy."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1098338,00.html |title=Stupid Questions with Kelly Clarkson |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]].

==Critical reception==
[[File:KClarkson2010.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Critics thought that "Behind These Hazel Eyes" showcases Clarkson's vocal prowess.]]
Elizabeth Scott of [[Sky Living]] praised the song, writing "while Clarkson is doing well musically, her love life still hasn't picked up and she is heartbroken once again.

In a different perspective, Joe Cross of [[Cox Communications]] thought that "Behind These Hazel Eyes" was a decent follow-up to "Since U Been Gone", saying "It's no "[[Since U Been Gone]]," which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." He also listed "Behind These Hazel Eyes" as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/0730summertop40.html|title=Summer's Top 40 |date=July 29, 2005|accessdate=February 29, 2012|last=Cross|first=Joe|publisher=Cox Communications.

===Synopsis===
The music video begins with Clarkson standing in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fianc<U+00E9> with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids run out of the room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fianc<U+00E9>, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fianc<U+00E9>. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fianc<U+00E9> exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fianc<U+00E9>, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.

===Reception===
James Dinh of MTV Newsroom listed "Behind These Hazel Eyes" as one of the music videos with "a bad case of the runaway bride syndrome," writing, "Throughout the clip, Clarkson finds herself running through a swampy mud land until she snaps out of her visions, refuses to proceed with the wedding and makes a shocking escape out of the church."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/07/11/beyonce-best-thing-i-never-had-video-pop-brides/|title=Beyonce Avoids Pop Star Runaway Bride Syndrome In 'Best Thing I Never Had' Video |date=November 7, 2011|accessdate=March 5, 2012|last=Dinh |first=James|publisher=MTV.

Bob Gendron of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reviewed Clarkson's performance, writing "the Texas native could've impressed simply by projecting her booming voice and relishing its prodigious range. Yet she seemed determined to reinforce female empowerment themes often missing from her mainstream-pop contemporaries' hits."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-03/entertainment/ct-ent-1205-kelly-clarkson-fray-review-20111204_1_chicago-theatre-kelly-clarkson-blazes|title=An upbeat Kelly Clarkson blazes through short set at Chicago Theatre |date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=March 8, 2012|last=Gendron |first=Bob |publisher=Tony W.
