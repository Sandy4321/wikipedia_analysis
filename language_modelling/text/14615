'''USS ''Chester'' (CA-27)''', a [[Northampton class cruiser|''Northampton''-class]] [[cruiser]], was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] named after the city of [[Chester, Pennsylvania]].

''Chester'' was launched [[3 July]] [[1929]] by New York Shipbuilding Co., Camden, N.J.; sponsored by Miss J. T. Blain; commissioned [[24 June]] [[1930]], Captain A. P. Fairfield in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

== History ==

=== Pre-war service ===
''Chester'' cleared Newport, R.I., [[13 August]] [[1930]] for an extensive European cruise. She visited [[Barcelona]], [[Naples]], [[Constantinople]], [[Phaleron Bay]], and [[Gibraltar]] before returning to Chester, Pa., for voyage repairs [[13 October]]. She joined the Scouting Fleet as flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Divisions, and, on [[6 March]] [[1931]], embarked the [[Secretary of the Navy]] for the Canal Zone where he observed the annual Fleet problem from ''Texas'' (BB-35). ''Chester'' carried the Secretary back to [[Miami]], Fla., arriving [[22 March]], then sailed to [[Narragansett Bay]] for exercises and duty escorting two visiting French cruisers.

Following an overhaul at [[New York Navy Yard]] during which she was equipped with two catapults amidships, ''Chester'' stood out of [[Hampton Roads]] [[31 July]] [[1932]] with planes and ammunition for the West Coast. She arrived at [[San Pedro, California]], [[14 August]] and joined in the regular activities of the Fleet. Departing San Pedro [[9 April]] [[1934]] as flagship of Commander, Special Service Squadron, she arrived in [[New York]] [[31 May]] for that day's [[Presidential Naval Review]], returning to San Pedro [[9 November]]. On [[25 September]] [[1935]], ''Chester'' embarked the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] and his party for a voyage to the [[Philippines]] in connection with the inauguration of the President of the Philippines Commonwealth on [[15 November]]. Returning to [[San Francisco]] [[14 December]] [[1935]], she resumed operations with Cruiser Division 4.

Sailing from San Francisco [[28 October]] [[1936]], ''Chester'' arrived at Charleston, S.C., [[13 November]] and departed 5 days later to escort ''Indianapolis'' (CA-35) with President F. D. Roosevelt embarked for a good-will visit to [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], and [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]]. ''Chester'' returned to San Pedro [[24 December]]. ''Chester'' remained on the West Coast for fleet exercises and training cruises to Hawaiian and Alaskan waters from 1937 except for a cruise to the East Coast for exercises and overhaul ([[23 September]] [[1940]]-[[21 January]] [[1941]]). 

=== 1941 ===
Homeported at [[Pearl Harbor]] from [[3 February]], the cruiser exercised in Hawaiian waters, and made one voyage to the West Coast with Commander, Scouting Force embarked ([[14 May]]<U+2013>[[18 June]] [[1941]]). From [[10 October]] to [[13 November]], she escorted two Army transports carrying reinforcements to [[Manila]], P.I. Upon her return she joined ''Northampton'' (CA-26) and ''Enterprise'' (CV-6) and was at sea returning from [[Wake Island]] when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

''Chester'' remained on patrol with TF&nbsp;8 in Hawaiian waters. On [[12 December]] her planes bombed a submarine, then guided ''Balch'' (DD-363) to a depth charge attack which continued until contact was lost. 

=== 1942 ===
Chester supported the reinforcement landing on Samoa ([[18 January]]<U+2013>[[24 January]] [[1942]]), then joined TG&nbsp;8.3 for the successful raid on [[Taroa]] ([[1 February]]). Retiring under heavy air attack, she received a bomb hit in the well deck which killed eight and injured 38. She returned to Pearl Harbor [[3 February]] for repairs.

Following an escort voyage to San Francisco, Chester joined TF&nbsp;17 for the [[Guadalcanal]]-[[Tulagi]] raid ([[4 May]]); the attack on Misima Island, Louisiade Archipelago ([[7 May]]); and the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] ([[8 May]]) during which her steady antiaircraft fire protected the carriers providing the air strikes which stopped the invasion force heading for Port Moresby, New Guinea. Five of ''Chester's'' crew were wounded in this encounter. On [[10 May]], she received 478 survivors of ''Lexington'' (CV-2) from ''Hammann'' (DD-412), whom she transferred to [[Tonga Island]] [[15 May]].

After a West Coast overhaul ''Chester'' arrived at Noumea [[21 September]] [[1942]], to join TF&nbsp;62 for the landings on [[Funafuti]], [[Ellice Islands]] ([[2 October]]<U+2013>[[4 October]]). She then proceeded south and while cruising in support of the operations in the Solomons, ''Chester'' was hit by a torpedo on the starboard side, amidships, on [[20 October]] which killed 11 and wounded 12. She returned to [[Espiritu Santo]] under her own power for emergency repairs [[23 October]]. Three days later SS ''President Coolidge'' struck a minefield and ''Chester'' sent fire and rescue parties to her aid as well as taking on the 440 survivors for transfer to Espiritu Santo. She steamed to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], [[29 October]] for further repairs and on [[Christmas Day]], departed for Norfolk and a complete overhaul.

=== 1943 ===
Returning to San Francisco [[13 September]] [[1943]], ''Chester'' operated on escort duty between that port and Pearl Harbor until [[20 October]]. On [[8 November]], she cleared Pearl Harbor for the invasion of the Marshalls. She covered the landings on [[Abemama Island]] and bombarded Taroa, [[Wotje]], and [[Maloelap]].

=== 1944 ===
''Chester'' assumed antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol off [[Majuro]] until [[25 April]] [[1944]] when she sailed for San Francisco and brief overhaul ([[6 May]]<U+2013>[[22 May]]). She joined TF&nbsp;94 at [[Adak Island|Adak]], [[Alaska]], [[27 May]] for the bombardments of [[Matsuwa]] and [[Paramushiru]] in the [[Kuriles]] on [[13 June]] and [[26 June]], then sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving [[13 August]].

''Chester'' sortied [[29 August]] with TG&nbsp;12.5 for the bombardment of Wake Island ([[3 September]]), then arrived at [[Eniwetok]] [[6 September]]. She cruised off [[Saipan]] and participated in the bombardment of [[Marcus Island]], [[9 October]], before joining TG&nbsp;38.1 for the carrier strikes on [[Luzon]] and [[Samar (island)|Samar]] in support of the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] operations, as well as searching for enemy forces after the [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]] ([[25 October]]<U+2013>[[26 October]]). 

=== 1945 ===
From [[8 November]] [[1944]] to [[21 February]] [[1945]] Chester operated from [[Ulithi]] and Saipan in bombardment of [[Iwo Jima]] and the [[Bonins]], supporting the invasion landings of [[19 February]].

After another West Coast overhaul, ''Chester'' returned to Ulithi [[21 June]] [[1945]] and conducted patrols off [[Okinawa]] from [[27 June]], as well as covering minesweeping operations west of the island. In late July, ''Chester'' was assigned to the force supplying air cover for the Coast Striking Group (TG&nbsp;95.2) off the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze Delta]] and protecting minesweeping. In August, she made a voyage to the Aleutians, and on the last day of the month sailed to participate in the occupation landings at [[Ominato]], [[Aomori]], [[Hakodate]], and [[Otaru]] in September and October. She embarked homeward bound troops at Iwo Jima and sailed on [[2 November]] for San Francisco, arriving [[18 November]]. She made another voyage to [[Guam]] to bring home servicemen ([[24 November]]<U+2013>[[17 December]]), then steamed on [[14 January]] [[1946]] for [[Philadelphia]], arriving [[30 January]].

== Decommissioning ==
''Chester'' was placed out of commission in reserve in Philadelphia on [[10 June]] [[1946]]. She was sold on [[11 August]] [[1959]].

== Awards ==
''Chester'' received 11 [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service.
