During the hiatus of Destiny's Child, Knowles released her debut solo album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' in 2003, which spawned the number one hits "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" and "[[Baby Boy (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]" and became one of the most successful albums of that year, earning her a then record-tying five [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref name="2004 Grammys"/> Following the group's disbandment in 2005, Knowles released her second solo album, ''[[B'Day]]'' in 2006.

The group changed its name to Destiny's Child in 1993, based on a passage in the [[Book of Isaiah]].<ref name="Kaufman" /> Together, they performed in local events and, after four years on the road, the group was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in late 1997. That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label d<U+00E9>but song, "Killing Time", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref name="Kaufman" /><ref name="J.R." /> The following year, the group released their [[Destiny's Child (album)|self-titled debut album]],<ref name="Farley" /> scoring their first major hit "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for "Best R&B/Soul Single" for "No, No, No", "Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year" and "Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist".<ref name="Kaufman" /> The group released their multi-platinum second album ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", the group's first number-one single, "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]", and "[[Say My Name]]", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. "Say My Name" won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[43rd Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Kaufman" /> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' sold more than eight million copies.<ref name="Farley" /> During this time, Knowles recorded a duet with [[Marc Nelson]] on the song "After All Is Said and Done" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, ''[[The Best Man (1999 film)|The Best Man]]''. 

Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against the group for breach of contract. [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared on the video of "Say My Name", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced.<ref name="Kaufman" /> Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months,<ref name="Farley" /> as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the strife.<ref name="Kaufman" /> During this time, Knowles had experienced depression from an accumulation of struggles: the publicized split of Luckett and Roberson, being publicly attacked by the media, critics and blogs for causing the split-up,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/beyonce%20i%20was%20depressed%20at%2019_1088171 |title=Beyonce: "I was depressed at 19" |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=2008-01-12 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> and a longstanding boyfriend (that she had dated from age 12 to 19 years) leaving her.<ref name="Depression">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/13/entertainment/main2258069.shtml |title=Beyonce On Love, Depression and Reality |work=CBS News |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/beyonce-speaks-about-her-past-depression_article_3131 |title=Beyonce Speaks About Her Past Depression |date=2006-12-15 |work=[[Access Hollywood]] |accessdate=2011-01-11}}</ref> The depression was so severe it had lasted for a couple of years, while she had kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything. Knowles stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first [[Grammy Award]] and she feared no one would take her seriously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/BEYONCE+KNOWLES-12915.html |title=Beyonce Knowles Opens Up About Depression |date=2006-12-18 |work=Female First |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.}}</ref> All of these events had made her question herself and who her friends were, describing the situation she said, "Now that I was famous, I was afraid I'd never find somebody again to love me for me. I was afraid of making new friends."<ref name="Depression" /> She remembers her mother, [[Tina Knowles]], for finally saying to help her out of her depression, "Why do you think a person wouldn't love you? Don't you know how smart and sweet and beautiful you are?"<ref name="Depression" />

After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eleven consecutive weeks.<ref name="Kaufman" /> Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former band mates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.<ref name="Kaufman" /> In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Knowles landed a major role in the [[MTV]] made-for-television film, ''[[Carmen: A Hip Hopera]]'', starring alongside American actor [[Mekhi Phifer]].

Knowles' music is generally [[contemporary R&B]], but she also incorporates [[pop music|pop]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[soul music|soul]] into her songs. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Knowles recorded several Spanish records for the re-release of ''B'Day''. Prior to recording the Spanish titles on the album's re-release, Knowles was coached phonetically by American record producer, Rudy Perez.<ref name="Vineyard1">{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: Behind The B'Day Videos 1 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/videos_07/news_feature_040207/index.jhtml |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks |accessdate=2008-04-02}}</ref> She also recorded a Spanish song during her time in Destiny's Child, and received favorable responses from their Latin fans. Knowles learned Spanish in school when she was young, but can now only speak a few words of the language. In November 2009, Gary Trust writing for ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' commented that Knowles' third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' "clearly represent[ed] four very different sides" of the singer artistry, judging from the fact that "[[If I Were a Boy]]" was "an intimate, acoustic turn", "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" oppositely aimed for more R&B/hip-hop audiences and ultimately become a pop-culture crossover smash, "[[Halo (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Halo]]" fared best at mainstream top 40 radio and "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]" is "perhaps the most pure dance song Beyonce has ever released." He concluded by writing that the variety of sounds in the album's singles follows the tradition of albums that "not only produced a bounty of radio hits, but also an artistic mini-reinvention on each track."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/beyonce-s-single-s-viva-variety-1004041506.story |title=Beyonce's 'Single's: Viva Variety |author=Gary Trust |date=2009-11-10 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |accessdate=2011-04-05}}</ref>

Known for being sexy, seductive and provocative when performing on stage, Knowles has stated that's her [[alter ego]], Sasha Fierce.<ref name="Depression"/> She described Sasha as being "too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy", stating "I'm not like her in real life at all ... I'm not flirtatious and super-confident and fearless like her. What I feel onstage I don't feel anywhere else. It's an out-of-body experience.

She then went on saying that she is comfortable enough with herself to be all of those things without an alias, stating "I don't need Sasha Fierce anymore, because I've grown and now I'm able to merge the two."<ref>{{cite web|last=Crosley |first=Hillary |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632774/20100226/knowles_beyonce.jhtml |title=Beyonce Says She 'Killed' Sasha Fierce |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}</ref>
