The '''Italian Code of Criminal Procedure''' contains the rules governing [[criminal procedure]] in every court in Italy.
The first and initial code in the [[Italian Republic]] was established by the [[Fascism|Fascist Government]] in 1930 and was kept until 1988. This code adopted an [[inquisitorial system]]. In 1988, a new code was enacted that chose to abandon the inquisitorial system but not complete the transition to [[adversarial system|the adversarial one]], and the resulting system could be considered to be somewhere in between.

==Parties==
The most important parties to a criminal trial are the Judge, <ref>Articles 1-49 of the Criminal Procedure Code</ref> the defendant <ref>Articles 60-73 of the Criminal Procedure Code</ref> and the ''Pubblico Ministero'' (the prosecutor).<ref>Articles 50-54-quater of the Criminal Procedure Code</ref>
There are other parties that are optional, and they are: the ''Polizia Giudiziaria'' (Judiciary Police, a branch of the Police whose duty is to help a prosecutor during his investigations),<ref>Articles 55-59 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref> the ''parte lesa'' (the injured party),<ref>Articles 90-95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref> the ''responsabile civile'' (civilly liable, who can be compelled to pay damages, if the defendant is not solvent) and the ''civilmente obbligato per la pena pecuniaria'' (civilly liable, who can be compelled to pay the fines, if the defendant is not solvent).<ref>Articles 74-89 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>

===Pubblico Ministero===

The Pubblico Ministero (the public prosecutor) is the one who, during the preliminary investigations, must look for evidence. Since he is a member of the Judiciary (technically, a ''Magistrato'' - Magistrate, though not a ''Giudice''[[#Notes|<sup>[p]</sup>]] - Judge), he must try and find out the truth; that's why he must not only look for evidence that can lead to a conviction, but also that which may lead to an acquittal.<ref>Article 358 states: ''il pubblico ministero [omissis] svolge altres<U+00EC> accertamenti su fatti e circostanze a favore della persona sottoposta alle indagini''</ref>

==Preliminary investigations==

When a Pubblico Ministero or a member of Polizia Giudiziaria becomes aware of the fact that a crime was committed, he must begin his investigation: in Italy, the public prosecutor has the duty to initiate criminal proceedings.<ref>As per article 112 of the Italian Constitution</ref>
The ''indagato'' (the person who is suspected to have committed the crime)<ref>So far, there is, technically speaking, no defendant yet, because an ''indagato'' (suspect) becomes ''imputato'' (defendant) only when summoned to appear before the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing.</ref> can charge a lawyer to investigate on that person's behalf, in order to prove innocence.<ref>Articles 391-bis-391-nonies of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</ref>
The ''Pubblico Ministero'' can appoint experts to carry out examinations; and, when the examination cannot be repeated (for instance, an autopsy), he must inform the ''indagato'', so that he can appoint another expert, to ensure his right of defense.
In case of interrogations, of searches and of seizures, the ''imputato'' can ask that his lawyer be present.

==Judge for the preliminary investigations==

During the preliminary investigations, a Judge only seldom intervenes. The ''Giudice per le Indagini Preliminari'' (Judge for the Preliminary Investigations) controls the actions of the ''Pubblico Ministero'', when the personal rights of the ''indagato'' are at stake. No ''indagato'' can be wiretapped, unless the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations has authorised it. All measures must be adopted by the Judge with an order, and he must also publish written explanations of his decisions.

===Precautionary measures===

The ''precautionary measures'', adopted during the preliminary investigations or afterwards, aim at preventing the defendant from fleeing, from committing another crime or from destroying true evidence or creating false evidence. They cannot be adopted unless there is proof that the defendant has committed a crime (''fumus commissi delicti''). The Judge competent to adopt these measures is either the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations or the Judge of the Trial, according to the phase of the proceeding they are in, when the ''Pubblico Ministero'' asks that the defendant's rights of movement be limited.

There are many kinds of precautionary measures: <ref>Articles 272-315 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>
:1. Coercive measures:
::1. prohibition to leave the country;
::2. duty to go to the nearest police station on given days;
::3. expulsion from one's family house;
::4. restraining orders;
::5. prohibition or duty to dwell in a given place;
::6. house arrest;
::7. provisional arrest;
:2. Interdictive measures:
::1. suspension of parental authority;
::2. suspension from a public office or service;
::3. temporary interdiction from practising given professional or entrepreneurial activities;
:3. real measures:
::1. precautionary sequestrations.
 
The defendant or the prosecutor can appeal against the order of the Judge before the ''Tribunale della Libert<U+00E0>'' (Court of Liberty). This court can uphold, modify or quash the Judge's order. Its decision can be appealed before the ''Corte di Cassazione'' (Court of Cassation). 

The ''CL'' (''Court of Liberty'') actually reviews all the evidence and must render its decision within ten days of the appeal. 

The ''Corte di Cassazione'', on the contrary, cannot rule on merits, but only on correct procedure and correct interpretation of the law.

==Interrogations and self-incriminating statements==

When a person who is neither an ''indagato'' (suspect) nor an ''imputato'' (defendant), interrogated by the police or the prosecutor, reveals pieces of information that might lead to his incrimination, the interrogation must be immediately stopped, the person must be invited to nominate a lawyer and be warned that the information disclosed may render necessary an investigation. These self-incriminating statements are inadmissible in court <ref>Article 63 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>.

The [[police]] or the prosecutor summon the ''indagato'', during the preliminary investigations, and inform him precisely of the actions he is alleged to have committed (not yet technically a charge); they also inform him of the evidence so far gathered against him, if this is not detrimental to the investigations; the ''indagato'' is also invited to defend himself, if he wish; the police or the prosecutor can also ask him questions, that he may refuse to answer<ref>Article 65 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>.

The ''indagato'', when interrogated, must be free of all undue influence, both psicological and physical. He must be willing to provide information (''animus confitendi''). The [[police]] or the prosecutor cannot use on the ''indagato'' any methods of techniques that may influence his right to self-determination or alter his memory or his capability to evaluate facts. This prohibition applies even if it was the ''indagato'' who asked that these methods or techniques were used. Before the interrogation begins, the ''indagato'' must be informed that his statements can be used against him in court; that he can choose not to answer the question, but that the investigations will proceed nonetheless; that, if he provides inormation concerning someone else's criminal responsibility, he will assume, as far as this responsibility is concerned, the office of witness<ref>Article 64 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>.

If evidence should be gathered in violation of these principles, it would be inadmissible in court.

==Preliminary hearing==

When the preliminary investigations are over, the Pubblico Ministero thinks that the evidence he gathered could not justify a conviction, he must ''archiviare'' the ''notitia criminis'' (he must drop the charges). If, on the contrary, he deems he can make his case, he summons the defendant to appear before the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing (JPH).<ref>Article 34, paragraph 2-bis, of the Code states that the person who served as a Judge for the Preliminary Investigations cannot serve as Judge of the Preliminary Hearing.</ref>

Before the JPH, the ''Pubblico Ministero'' presents all the evidence he has gathered so far; the defendant can make his case and try to prove his innocence. The JPH, if convinced of the defendant's innocence or that the evidence gathered would not be enough to justify a guilty verdict, passes a sentence of ''non luogo a procedere'' (no grounds to proceed). 

Should new evidence be found, the Prosecutor may ask the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations (''JPI'') that this judgement be revoked. During the hearing, before the JPI, the defendant can be assisted by his lawyer. If the sentence is revoked, the Prosecutor must, once again, summon the defendant before the JPH.

If, on the contrary, the JPH thinks that the evidence gathered so far is enough to justify a guilty verdict, he issues a ''decreto'' (order or decree <ref>The difference between a ''decreto'' and an ''ordinanza'', although both are forms of orders, is that, when issuing a ''decreto'', the Judge does not have to publish written explanations of his decisions.</ref>) of ''rinvio al giudizio'' (indictment).

All the evidence gathered so far is, then, expelled from the defendant's file, with the exception of those pieces of evidence that cannot be repeated, such as the initial autopsy or a search and seizure, or that were gathered in the defendant's presence and in that of his lawyer or his experts.

==Trial==

During the ''dibattimento'' (trial), both the Prosecutor and the defendant try to make their case.

Article 111 of the Italian Constitution states that

<blockquote>
<p>2. Trials are based on equal confrontation of the parties before an independent and impartial judge. The law has to define reasonable time limits for the proceedings.</p>
<p>3. In criminal trials, the law provides for timely and confidential information of the accused regarding the nature and reasons of charges brought against them; they are granted the time and means for their defense; they have the right to question those who testify against them or to have them questioned; those who may testify in favor of the accused must be summoned and examined under the same conditions granted to the prosecution; any evidence in favor of the accused must be acknowledged; the accused may rely on the help of an interpreter if they do not understand or speak the language of the proceedings.</p>
<p>4. In criminal trials, evidence may only be established according to the principle of confrontation between parties. No defendant may be proven guilty on the basis of testimony given by witnesses who freely and purposely avoided cross-examination by the defense.</p>
</blockquote>

During the trial, all the witnesses must bear testimony once again, as must the experts. Plus, all the experiments, conducted during the preliminary investigations, must be repeated as possible and so on, to allow the defendant to actually participate in the process of ''formazione della prova'' (proof formation).

If the ''Giudice del Dibattimento'' (Judge of the Trial) is convinced beyond any reasonable doubts the defendant is guilty, the Judge must convict him; if not, the Judge must acquit. The Judge must also publish written explanations of his decisions.

===Defendant===

The defendant can be called to the stand, but he may refuse to bear testimony<ref>Technically, a defendant does not bear testimony, he is not a witness; in fact, in Italian, a witness is ''interrogato'', whereas a defendant is ''esaminato''</ref>, or he may refuse to answer some questions. He can also lie. Since he does not take an oath and since he is not technically a witness, if a defendant tells a lie, he is not committing [[perjury]].

A defendant can also choose to make spontaneous statements to the Judge; he can tell whatever he wishes to tell and can choose not to answer any questions. In this case too, a defendant can lie without consequences.

==Appeals==

Both the defendant and the prosecutor can appeal against the judgement before the Corte d'Appello (Court of Appeals), that will retry the defendant. The judgement passed by the Court of Appeals can be appealed, again, before the Court of Cassation, that cannot rule on merits. It is important to stress that both the Court of Appeals and the Court of Cassation must examine and rule on every appeal. They can uphold, modify or quash the sentence.

==Statute of limitations==

The Italian criminal system has a statute limiting the time for prosecution of all crimes, apart from felonies punishable by [[life imprisonment]], to a period of time equalling the maximum penalty provided for by law, which cannot, though, be less than six years for ''crimini'' ([[felony|felonies]]) and four years for ''contravvenzioni'' ([[misdemeanour|misdemeanours]]).

It is important to note that it is not enough that the criminal suit was started before the statute of limitations ran out: it is the definitive sentence that must be handed down before the term expires.

There is also another statute of limitations, limiting the time for enforcing a penalty, to a period of time provided for by law: twice the time to be served, or ten years in the case of a fine, when dealing with a felony; five years, when dealing with misdemeanours.

==Judges of the trial==

It is important to note that Italy does not try anybody by a [[jury]] of peers. Everyone is judged by professional judges or by a panel of judges (three or five or nine). The only exception to the use of professional judges is in the [[Corte d'Assise]], which is made up of eight judges: two are professional, six are [[Wiktionary:lay|lay]] (they are called ''Giudici Popolari'' or Popular Judges, where 'popular' means 'of the people'). All wear a sash in the national colours. They are not technically ''[[juror]]s'', as the term is understood in Anglo-Saxon [[jurisprudence]]. In Italian, ''Giudice'' (Judge) refers both to the eight of them together as a collective body<ref>It refers also to the three or five or nine judges, that make up a panel of professional judges.</ref> and to each of them considered separately as a member of that body.

Since Lay Judges are not jurors, they cannot be excused, unless there are grounds that would justify an objection to a Judge. Also, they are not [[Sequestration (law)|sequestered]], because a trial often lasts too long to restrict travel: an Italian trial, including the preliminary investigations, preliminary hearing, trial and appeals, can last several years. To keep a citizen - who continues to work, while serving as a Popular Judge - sequestered for years would be unfeasible.

==Special Proceedings==
Generally, every criminal proceeding follows the same pattern: there are the preliminary investigations, there's a preliminary hearing, the trial and the appeals. It may occur, though, that one of these phases is not present.

===Fast-track trial===

The ''giudizio abbreviato'' (fast-track trial, literally abbreviated proceeding)<ref>Articles 438-443 of the code of criminal procedure</ref> consists, basically, of a proceeding where the trial phase is absent.
 	
It is the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing who, according to the evidence gathered, during the preliminary investigations by the prosecutor and by the lawyer during the defensive investigations, if there were any, convicts or acquits the defendant.
	 
Since this is a reduction of the defendant's rights (he basically gives up his right to presenting new evidence and to be tried by a Judge of the Trial), it must be he who asks that the Judge of the Preliminary Hearing hand down a judgement over him.
 	
The defendant is rewarded with a reduction on the sentence. The law states that this reduction is one third. If the crime was punishable by life imprisonment, the defendant will be sentenced to thirty years.

Both the defendant and the prosecutor can appeal the judgement before the Court of Appeals.

===Plea bargaining (''patteggiamento'')===

When the prosecutor deems that the punishment that would, concretely, be handed down is less than five-year [[imprisonment]] (or that it would just be a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]), he may plea-bargain<ref>Articles 444-448 of the code of criminal procedure</ref> with the defendant.

Since a prosecutor is obliged to prosecute all crimes he becomes aware of, as per the Constitution, he cannot drop a serious charge, if the defendant accepts to plead guilty to a lesser charge. This means that Italian plea bargaining is quite different from the American. 

The defendant must accept to plead guilty to the charges, no matter how serious they are<ref>But, since there is the five-year-imprisonment limitation, it is impossible that a defendant in a serious crime case can plea-bargain.</ref>. The bargaining is not about the charges, but about the sentence. When both the prosecutor and the defendant have come to an agreement, the proposal is submitted to the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations or to the Judge for the Preliminary Hearing. He will, then, weigh the evidence and, if he is convinced that the defendant is not guilty, he must not accept the proposal and acquit the defendant; if, on the contrary, he deems that the defendant is guilty and is satisfied with the punishment, he must sanction the proposal. If the Judge deems that the defendant is guilty, but thinks that the proposed punishment is too light, he can refuse to accept the proposal and the proceeding will continue, but the defendant can ask again that his proposal be accepted.

If a Judge accepts a proposal by the prosecutor and the defendant, the judgement can be appealed only before the Court of Cassation.

===Giudizio direttissimo===

When the defendant was [[arrest|arrested]] ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'', the prosecutor can order that he be conducted before the Judge of the Trial, within thirty days of the [[arrest]], if he is still in remedial custody; if he was freed, the prosecutor summons the defendant to appear before the court<ref>Articles 449-452 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>. If there is no need to carry out any further investigations, the defendant will be tried immediately<ref>In this case, the defendant has no right to a preliminary hearing, because, being arrested ''in flagrante delicto'', it is presumed that the evidence the prosecutor can present is more than enough to make a case</ref>.

The prosecutor and the defendant can appeal the judgement.

===Immediate trial (''giudizio immediato'')===

When it appears manifest that the ''indagato'' has committed the crime, if this does not seriously compromise the investigations, and when the ''indagato'' has been interrogated, or, summoned before the public prosecutor, has not appeared, or when the ''imputato'' is under provisional arrest, the public prosecutor can apply to the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations for the immediate trial<ref>Articles 453-458 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>.

This application must be submitted within 90 days of the beginning of the investigations.

The ''imputato'' too can apply for the immediate trial.

If the Judge for the Preliminary Hearing grants this request, the Preliminary Hearing does not take place.

===Criminal Decree of Conviction (''decreto penale di condanna'')===

When the public prosecutor deems that the defendant should just be handed down a [[fine]] (even if inflicted in lieu of a prison sentence <ref>A penalty of up to six months' imprisonment can be changed to a fine</ref>), he may apply, within six months of the beginning of the investigations, to the Judge for the Preliminary Investigations for a criminal decree of convinction<ref>Articles 459-464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</ref>.

The application must indicate the evidence gathered so far and the punishment considered adequate, which can be diminished to up to half the penalty imposed by law. The judge can acquit the defendant or inflict the punishment requested.

The defendant can impugn the decree within 15 days of the service of the decree. If this happens, the defendant is summoned before the [[Italian Criminal Procedure#Preliminary hearing|Judge of the Preliminary Hearing]].

In his criminal complaint, the injured party can declare that he does not want the defendant to be convicted by decree.
