'''Pete Best''' (born 24 November 1941) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[musician]], best known as the original [[drummer]] in [[The Beatles]].

After moving from India to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] (1924<U+2013>1988) started [[The Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool, which became very popular<U+2014>the membership list grew to over a thousand<U+2014>and where The Beatles (then known as [[The Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts. The club was also known as The Casbah Club, or simply The Casbah. Best played there with his first band, The Black Jacks, and later with The Beatles.

Best joined The Beatles on 12 August 1960, only one day before they were to go to [[Hamburg]] to play a season of club dates. [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], and [[George Harrison]], who were the co-founders and nucleus of the group, elected to dispense with his service two years later, on 16 August 1962, and he was replaced by [[Ringo Starr]]. Best states that he was never given a full explanation as to the reason he was let go.

He later worked as a [[civil service|civil servant]] for 20 years, before starting The Pete Best Band. Best has been married for over 45 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.

Best was born in [[Chennai|Madras]], [[India]], which was a British colony at the time. Best's father, John Best, came from a family of sports promoters in Liverpool, who once owned and ran the [[Liverpool Stadium]].<ref name="BestRoagPetep44">Roag and Pete Best (2003) p1</ref><ref>[http://www.lmu.livjm.ac.uk/inmylife/template.aspx?itemid=1214 Liverpool Stadium and Johnny Best] lmu.livjm.ac.uk <U+2013> Retrieved 1 December 2007 {{Wayback|url=http://www.lmu.livjm.ac.uk/inmylife/template.aspx?itemid=1214|date =20070807041310|bot=DASHBot}}</ref> Mona Best was born in [[Delhi]], India, and was the daughter of a British army officer.

== The Beatles and Hamburg ==
<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->
In 1960, [[Allan Williams]] arranged a season of bookings for The Beatles in Hamburg, starting on 12 August 1960, but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped that he could find a better act to follow them.<ref name="Spitzp203">Spitz (2005) p203</ref>

Having no permanent drummer, Paul McCartney looked around for someone to fill the Hamburg position. Best had been seen playing with The Black Jacks in The Casbah, and it was noted that he had become a steady drummer, meaning that he played the [[bass drum]] on all four [[beat (music)|beats]] in the [[Bar (music)|bar]], which pushed the [[rhythm]].<ref name="Spitzp204">Spitz (2005) p204</ref> Best was known in Liverpool as being "mean, moody, and magnificent" by female fans, which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group.<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD"><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 <U+2013> 0:39:26) McCartney talking Best<U+2019>s reputation in Liverpool</ref> After The Black Jacks broke up, McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg with the group, but lied by saying they would earn <U+00A3>15 per week each.<ref name="Milesp57"/><ref name="CynthiaJohnp69-70">Lennon (2006) pp69-70</ref> As Best had passed his school [[exam]]s<U+2014>unlike Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had failed most of them<U+2014>he had the chance to go to a teacher-training college, but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move.<ref name="Spitzp6">Spitz (2005) p6</ref> Best had an [[audition]] in the Jacaranda club<U+2014>owned by Williams<U+2014>and travelled to Hamburg the next day with The Beatles.<ref name=autogenerated5><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:39:49) Harrison talking about the audition with Best</ref><ref>[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/archives/my-beatle-days.shtml My Beatle Days, by Pete Best] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007</ref> Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as The Beatles hadn't found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but didn't tell Best in case he were to ask for more money.<ref name="Goldsmithp46">Goldsmith (2004) p46</ref>
[[Image:Pete Best in Hamburg.jpg|thumb|right| An [[Albert Marrion]] photo of Best in Liverpool, 17 December 1961.]]
The Beatles first played at the Indra club in Hamburg, but slept in the Bambi Kino (cinema) in small, dirty rooms, which were noisy, cold, and directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the ''Indra'', Best remembered it as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger [[Kaiserkeller]].<ref name="Spitzp208">Spitz 2005 p208</ref> As Best had been the only one to take [[O-Level]] German at school, he could communicate with [[Bruno Koschmider]]<U+2014>the club's owner<U+2014>and the clientele better than the rest of the group.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp77">Lennon (2006) p77</ref> After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise, The Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller.<ref name="MilesPage57-58">Miles (1997) pp57-8</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp76">Cynthia Lennon <U+201C>John<U+201D> 2006 p76</ref> In October 1960, they left Koschmider's club to work at the Top Ten Club, which was run by Peter Eckhorn, as he offered the group more money, and a slightly better place to sleep, though by doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider.<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnPage93">Lennon (2006) p93</ref><ref name="MilesPage71-72">Miles (1997) pp71-72</ref> When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, Best found a [[condom]] in his luggage, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set fire to it.<ref name="Spitzp230">Spitz 2005 p230</ref> There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted [[arson]]. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local [[prison|jail]] and were [[deportation|deported]], as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.<ref name=autogenerated4><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:49:56) Notice telling Harrison to leave Hamburg.</ref><ref name="MilesPage72-73">Miles (1997) pp72-73</ref><ref>Lewisohn (1990) p24</ref>

Back in Liverpool, no-one contacted each other for two weeks, but Mona and Best made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group's equipment, which they eventually managed to do.<ref name="Spitzp231">Spitz (2005) p231</ref> The ex-Black Jacks guitarist [[Chas Newby]] was invited to play bass with them for four concerts, as [[Stuart Sutcliffe|Stu Sutcliffe]] had decided to stay on in Hamburg.<ref>[http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1960/1960.html Photo of Chas Newby] beatlesource.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007</ref> Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing, and remembered Best's drumming to be very powerful, which pushed the group to play harder and louder.<ref name="Spitzp5">Spitz (2005) p5</ref> It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style, as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to "Crank it up" (play as loud as possible).<ref name="Spitzp214">Spitz (2005) p214</ref> Newby played with the group at Litherland Town Hall and at The Casbah.<ref name="Spitzp234">Spitz (2005) p234</ref> When the group returned to Hamburg, Best was invited to sing a speciality number called "[[Peppermint Twist]]" while McCartney played the drums, but Best always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage.<ref>[http://www.eskimo.com/~bpentium/beatles/besttape/besttape.html Best and "Peppermint Twist"] eskimo.com - Retrieved 26 November 2007</ref>

[[Beatles-Platz]] in Hamburg includes a hybrid sculpture representing an amalgam of Best and Starr on drums, along with sculptures specifically representing Lennon, Sutcliffe, McCartney, and Harrison.

=== "My Bonnie" ===
The reunited Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961. While playing at the Top Ten Club they were recruited by singer [[Tony Sheridan]] to act as his [[Backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for the German [[Polydor Records]] label, produced by bandleader [[Bert Kaempfert]].<ref name="CynthiaLennonJohnp97">Lennon (2006) p97</ref><ref name="LewisohnChronicles">LewisohnChronicles</ref> Kaempfert signed the group to a Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October 1961, Polydor released the recording "[[My Bonnie]]" (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur) which appeared on the German charts under the name "Tony Sheridan and The Beat Brothers"<U+2014>a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan's backup band.<ref>Spitz (2005) p250</ref> The song was later released in the UK.<ref name="MyBonnie"><U+201C>My Bonnie<U+201C> / <U+201C>The Saints<U+201C> 23 April 1962.

== Auditions with Decca and Parlophone ==
<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->
Brian Epstein, who had been managing The Beatles for less than a month, arranged for the group to [[The Beatles' Decca audition|have an audition]] at [[Decca Records]] on New Year's Day, 1962.<ref>Unterberger, Richie. ''The unreleased Beatles: music & film''.  2006, Hal Leonard Corp., ISBN 978-0-87930-892-6, p. 18</ref>  They played 15 songs, mostly covers,<ref name=unter19>Unterberger, p. 19</ref> and as John Lennon later admitted, were "terrified and nervous".  A month later, Decca turned The Beatles down.<ref name=unter22>Unterberger, p. 22</ref> 

Five months later, on 6 June 1962, The Beatles played a [[Parlophone]] audition at [[Abbey Road Studios]] for [[George Martin]].<ref name="Martin120-123">Martin (1994) pp120-123</ref> Ron Richards and his engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] recorded four songs, which Martin (who was not present during the recording) listened to at the end of the session. The recording convinced Martin that the group was good enough to be signed to a contract (even though he had already signed a contract with Epstein) but with one exception; Martin and his engineers wanted to use an experienced session drummer in Best's place, as was common practice amongst producers. How much this played into the subsequent sacking of Best has never been made clear. Many years later Martin himself worried that it played no small role: "I decided that the drums, which are really the backbone of a good rock group, didn't give the boys enough support. They needed a good solid beat and I said to Brian, 'Look, it doesn't matter what you do with the boys, but on record, nobody need know. I'm gonna use a hot drummer.' Brian said, 'Okay, fine.' I felt guilty because I felt maybe I was the catalyst that had changed his life, so I'm sorry about that, Pete." <ref name=autogenerated1><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 1:02:54) Martin talking about Best<U+2019>s drumming.</ref><ref name="Milesp90">Miles (1997) p90</ref><ref name="Spitzp318">Spitz (2005) p318</ref>

== Dismissal ==
When the group heard that Martin and the engineers preferred a session drummer for their upcoming recording session, Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison asked Epstein<U+2014>who had taken over as manager in January<U+2014>to dismiss Best from the band.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp119">Lennon (2006) p119</ref> Before Epstein became The Beatles' manager, Best had arranged all the bookings in Liverpool, after they had parted company with Williams.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp106">Lennon (2006) p106</ref><ref name="Spitzp330">Spitz (2005) p330</ref> Epstein agonised about the decision.  As he wrote in his autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he "wasn't sure" about George Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and "was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities...so...I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was."<ref>Epstein, Brian, ''A Cellarful of Noise''.  Pyramid Books, 1964, p. 63</ref> Epstein also asked [[Bob Wooler]] for advice, to which Wooler replied that Best was too popular with the fans to be gotten rid of.<ref name="Spitzp329">Spitz (2005) p329</ref> Ultimately, Epstein decided that "if the group was to remain happy Pete Best must go"<ref>Epstein, Brian, ''A Cellarful of Noise''.  Pyramid Books, 1964, p. 63</ref>so he called Best to his office and dismissed him on 16 August 1962, which was two years and four days after Best had joined the group.<ref name="Milesp57">Miles (1997) p57</ref><ref name="Spitzp330" />

Best's friend [[Neil Aspinall]] was waiting for Best downstairs in Epstein's NEMS record shop after the meeting at which Best was dismissed, and was the first person to talk to him after he had heard from Epstein.  The two had a drink in The Grapes [[public house|pub]], across from [[The Cavern Club]], where The Beatles had often played.<ref name="Spitzp331">Spitz (2005) p331</ref> Starting in 1961, Aspinall had become good friends with Best and subsequently rented a room in the house where Best lived with his parents. Best asked Aspinall to become the band's roadie, resulting in Aspinall buying an old [[Commer]] van for 80 pounds. He had been employed as the band's road manager and personal assistant, and was furious and said that he would stop working for them as well <U+2014> but Best strongly advised him not to. Aspinall asked Lennon at the next concert why they had fired Best, to which he replied, "It<U+2019>s got nothing to do with you <U+2014> you<U+2019>re only the driver."<ref name="MerseyBeatNeilAspinallPage2">[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/neilaspinall2.shtml Aspinall, The Beatles and money - Mersey Beat] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 11 February 2007</ref> 

Prior to Best's dismissal, during one of the extended business trips of Best's father, the 19-year-old<ref>[http://music.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,2267866,00.html Williams, Richard. "Obituary - Neil Aspinall"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 25 March 2008]</ref> Aspinall became romantically involved with Best's mother, Mona Best, who was 17 years his senior. During this period, Aspinall fathered a child by Mona: Vincent "Roag" Best.<ref name=" CynthiaJohnp44">Lennon (2006) p44.</ref><ref>[http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Reviews/books/drummedout.htm Review of <U+201C>Drummed Out<U+201D> <U+2013> The sacking of Pete Best]  iol.ie/~beatlesireland - Retrieved 11 February 2007 {{Wayback|url=http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Reviews/books/drummedout.htm|date =20070113202925|bot=DASHBot}}</ref> Roag Best was born in late July 1962, just three weeks prior to Best's dismissal. On 16 August 1962, Best was dismissed.<ref name="Spitzp331" /> Despite his professed initial support for Best, after his friend's dismissal from the Beatles, Aspinall elected to stay in the employ of the group, and he ended his relationship with Mona (and their three-week-old baby, Roag).<ref name="MerseyBeatNeilAspinallPage2"/> 

Lennon, McCartney and Harrison are all on record as stating that their first and sole choice to replace Best was Ringo Starr and they informed Epstein of this fact.  Bill Harry has claimed that the vacant drummer position in The Beatles was initially offered by manager Brian Epstein to Johnny Hutchinson of [[The Big Three (musical group)|The Big Three]], whom he also managed. Hutchinson turned down the job, saying "Pete Best is a very good friend of mine. I couldn't do the dirty on him". Hutchinson did agree to fill in three bookings until second choice Ringo Starr could join. Starr took Best's place in the band.<ref>[http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/petebest3.shtml Bill Harry on Pete Best's Sacking]</ref> Harry's claim has never been substantiated by the Beatles.

Starr had previously played with [[Rory Storm|Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]], the alternate band in the Kaiserkeller, and had stepped in to drum with The Beatles in Hamburg and Liverpool when Best was ill or unable to play.<ref name="Milesp90" /><ref>[http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/beatles/rorystorm_hamburg.shtml Best and Bill Harry on Rory Storm] triumphpc.com - Retrieved 5 November 2007</ref> Best's dismissal was reported on the front-page of the ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' magazine, upsetting many Beatles fans. The Beatles encountered some jeering and heckling in the street and on stage for weeks afterwards, with some fans shouting, "Pete forever, Ringo [Starr] never!" One agitated fan [[headbutt]]ed Harrison in The Cavern, giving him a [[black eye]].<ref name=autogenerated6><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 1:04:24) Harrison  talking about <U+201C>Pete forever, Ringo never!<U+201D>.</ref><ref name="CynthiaJohnp120">Lennon (2006) p120</ref>

=== Reasons for Best's dismissal ===

[[Image:Best Sutcliffe and Harrison.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Best (top left) on stage in Hamburg, with Sutcliffe and Harrison in 1961.]]
Best was never told why he was dismissed from The Beatles, as the only reason Epstein stated to him was, "The lads don't want you in the group anymore".<ref name="Spitzp330" /> Epstein subsequently claimed in his autobiography that Lennon, McCartney and Harrison thought Best "too conventional to be a Beatle, and though he was friendly with John, he was not liked by George and Paul."<ref>Epstein, Brian, ''A Cellarful of Noise''.  Pyramid Books, 1964, p. 63</ref> It has been documented (notably in [[Cynthia Lennon]]'s book ''John'') that while Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison usually spent their offstage time together in Hamburg and Liverpool, writing songs or socialising, Best generally went off alone. This left Best on the outside, as he was not privy to many of the group's experiences, references, and in-jokes.<ref name="BeatlesIreland">[http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Reviews/books/drummedout.htm The Sacking Of Pete Best]  iol.ie/~beatlesireland - Retrieved 31 May 2007 {{Wayback|url=http://www.iol.ie/~beatlesireland/Reviews/books/drummedout.htm|date =20070113202925|bot=DASHBot}}</ref> 

On their first trip to Hamburg, The Beatles realised that the stage suits they wore could not stand up to the hours of sweating and jumping about on stage every night, so they all bought leather jackets, jeans and cowboy boots, which were much tougher. Best preferred to play in short sleeves, and so did not match the sartorial style of the group, even though he was later photographed wearing a leather jacket and jeans.<ref name="Spitzp213-214">Spitz 2005 pp213-214</ref> Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Sutcliffe were introduced to drugs in Hamburg. As they had to play for hours every night, they often took [[Preludin]] to keep themselves awake, which were given to them by German customers or by [[Astrid Kirchherr]], whose mother bought them.<ref name=autogenerated2><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:44:28) Starr and Harrison talking about Preludins in Hamburg</ref> Lennon would often take four or five, but Best always refused to join in.<ref name="Milesp66-67">Miles (1997) pp66-67</ref><ref name="Spitzp219">Spitz (2005) p219</ref>  

Kirchherr asked The Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a municipal park called "der Dom" which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all<U+2014>minus Best who decided not to go<U+2014>to her mother's house in Altona.<ref name=autogenerated3><U+201D>The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 0:47:16) Harrison talking about their friends: Kircherr, Voormann and Volmer.</ref><ref name="Spitzp223">Spitz (2005) p223</ref> Best was described by Dot Rhone<U+2014>McCartney's girlfriend at the time, who later visited Hamburg<U+2014>as being very quiet, and never taking part in conversations with the group.<ref name="Spitzp246">Spitz (2005) p246</ref> 

Best's popularity with fans was a source of friction, as many female fans considered Best to be the band's best-looking member.<ref name="Spitzp322">Spitz (2005) p322</ref> It has been said that Epstein became exasperated with Best's refusal to adopt the [[mop-top]]-style [[Beatle haircut]] as part of their unified look, although Best later claimed that he was never asked to change his hairstyle. In a 1995 [[BBC]] ''[[Radio Merseyside]]'' interview, Kirchherr explained: "My boyfriend, [[Klaus Voorman]], had this hairstyle, and Stuart [Sutcliffe] liked it very, very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the [[Brylcreem]] out of his hair, and asking me to cut his hair for him. Pete Best has really curly hair, and it wouldn't work."<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool">[http://members.aol.com/scottwheelerband/astrid.htm Kirchherr's interview on BBC Radio Merseyside's 500th "On The Beat" programme - Saturday 26 August 1995] members.aol.com - Retrieved 21 May 2007</ref>

[[Radio Merseyside]] presenter, Spencer Leigh, wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous.<ref name="Leighp01">Leigh ''Drummed Out!: The Sacking of Pete Best'' (1998)</ref> During the ''Teenagers' Turn'' showcase in [[Manchester]], Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed.<ref name="Spitzp322" /> Best was surrounded at the stage door afterwards by attentive females while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]], was present at the time and admonished Best by saying: "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back?  I think that was very selfish of you".<ref name="Spitzp322" /> Mona Best's take on her son's sacking, as told to British television in 1963 with Pete by her side:  "From the point of clash of personalties, well, probably that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others.  [Interviewer: "Too good looking perhaps, eh?"]  I'll leave that for other people to say but from my point of view we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones at the boys because there is no really hard feeling.  There was at first, but it's just ''the way that it was done'' that has annoyed us.  If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark."<ref>"Best of the Beatles<U+201D> DVD 2005 (1:48:48) Mona and Pete reflecting on Pete's dismissal, in vintage television clip</ref> Martin was shocked that Epstein had sacked Best: "He seemed to be the most salable commodity as far as looks went. It was a surprise when I learned that they had dropped Pete. The drums were important to me for a record, but they didn<U+2019>t matter much otherwise. Fans don<U+2019>t pay particular attention to the quality of the drumming".<ref name="HarryBeatlesEncyclopedia">Harry 2001 - ''The Beatles<U+2019> Encyclopedia''</ref> Martin used [[session musician]] [[Andy White (drummer)|Andy White]] on the third session for "[[Love Me Do]]" on 11 September, and not Starr, who was Best's replacement.<ref name="Spitzp353">Spitz (2005) p353</ref>

Though sometimes overshadowed by the "handsome debate", musically Best has been judged to have had a limited rhythmic vocabulary that was seen as holding the other three band members back from their collective musical growth. George Martin, as noted above, deemed Best's drumming to be inadequate for a record.  As stated in Bob Spitz's 2005 biography, "All Pete could do was play 'Fours'..." a style of drumming that uses kick drum notes on every quarter note to hold down the beat. Spitz's book also contains engineer Ron Richards' account of his failed attempts to teach Best somewhat more complicated beats for different songs.<ref name="Spitzp318"/> Critic and Beatles historian [[Richie Unterberger]] described Best's drumming at the Decca session as "thinly textured and rather unimaginative"<ref name=unter19/> and said that Best "pushes the beat a little too fast for comfort".<ref name=unter22/> Unterberger thought Ringo Starr to be "more talented."<ref>Unterberger, p. 24</ref> Beatles critic [[Alan W. Pollack]] compared the Best, Starr, and Andy White versions of "[[Love Me Do]]" and concluded that Best was "an incredibly unsteady and tasteless drummer" on his version.<ref>[http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/AWP/lmd.shtml Notes On "Love Me Do"]</ref>  

All the other Beatles went on record about the dismissal of Best.  Paul McCartney said that "it was a strictly professional decision.  If he wasn't up to the mark... then there was no other choice".  He also pronounced Best to be "a bit limited."  Lennon called the 'handsome debate' a "myth", claimed that Best was only recruited for the band because the Beatles needed a drummer to go to Hamburg, and said, "We were always going to dump him when we found a decent drummer."  Harrison said that "Pete kept being sick and not showing up for gigs" and claimed that "I was quite responsible for stirring things up.  I conspired to get Ringo in for good; I talked to Paul and John until they came round to the idea."<ref>The Beatles, ''The Beatles Anthology''.  Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, pp. 70-72</ref>  For his part, Ringo said that "I felt I was a much better drummer than he was."<ref>The Beatles, ''The Beatles Anthology''.  Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, pp. 70-72</ref>

Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all later stated that they regretted the manner in which they sacked Best.  Lennon admitted that "We were cowards when we sacked him."<ref>The Beatles, ''The Beatles Anthology''.  Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, p. 70</ref> McCartney has stated that "I do feel sorry for him, because of what he could have been on to."<ref>The Beatles, ''The Beatles Anthology''.  Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, p. 70</ref> Harrison said "We weren't very good at telling Pete he had to go"<ref>The Beatles, ''The Beatles Anthology''.  Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, p. 72</ref> and "Historically it may look like we did something nasty to Pete and it may have been that we could have handled it better."<ref>"The Beatles Anthology<U+201D> DVD 2003 (Episode 1 - 1:03:05) Harrison discusing Best's sacking</ref> Only Ringo has remained unapologetic: "I never felt sorry for Pete Best.

Chronicle Books, 2000, ISBN 978-0-8118-2684-6, p. 72</ref>  Beatles authority [[Mark Lewisohn]] has concluded that "Despite his alleged shortcomings, it was still shabby treatment for Pete... the most underhand, unfortunate and unforgivable chapter in the Beatles' rise to monumental power."<ref name="lewisohn-chron58">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Lewisohn |title=The Complete Beatles Chronicle |publisher=Pyramid Books |year=1992 |page=58}}</ref>

Soon after Best was dismissed, Epstein tried to console him by offering to build another group around him, but Best turned him down. Feeling let-down and depressed, he sat at home for two weeks<U+2014>not wanting to face anybody or answer the inevitable questions about why he had been sacked.<ref name="CynthiaJohnp119"/> Best joined Lee Curtis & the All Stars, which then broke off from Curtis and became Pete Best & the All Stars. They signed to [[Decca Records]], and released the single "I'm Gonna Knock On Your Door", which was not a hit.<ref name="AfterTheBeatles"/> Best later relocated to the [[United States]] along with songwriters [[Wayne Bickerton]] and Tony Waddington. As The Pete Best Four, and later as The Pete Best Combo (increasing their number to five) they toured the United States with a combination of 1950s songs and original tunes, recording for small labels, but had little success.<ref name="AfterTheBeatles">[http://www.petebest.com/1963.asp After The Beatles] petebest.com/1963 - Retrieved 4 December 2007</ref> They ultimately released an album on Savage Records, titled ''Best Of The Beatles''; a play on Best's name, leading to disappointment for record buyers who expected a Beatles' [[compilation album|compilation]]. The group disbanded shortly afterwards. Bickerton and Waddington were to find greater success as songwriters in the 1970s, writing a series of hits for the American female group, [[The Flirtations (R&B musical group)|The Flirtations]] and [[The Rubettes|Rubettes]].

In 1964, Best appeared on American television as the mystery guest on  ''[[I've Got A Secret]]'', stating that he hailed from "West Derby in Lancashire".<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToLZewcgIK8</ref>   After his secret was revealed, he said simply that he had his own group now.

Best decided to leave show business, and by the time of [[Hunter Davies]]' 1968 authorised Beatles' biography, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles' association. Years later Best stated in his autobiography, "The Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily-printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer.  There was not a single friendly word from any one of them."<ref>Best, Pete and Patrick Doncaster. ''BEATLE! The Pete Best Story''.

Best appeared in an advertisement for [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] lager, which was broadcast during the first commercial break of the first episode of the [[The Beatles Anthology (film)|''Anthology'' TV series]] on [[ITV]] in November 1995. The tag line was "Probably the Pete Best lager in the world", a variation of Carlsberg's well known slogan.<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Neil Aspinall: The Times obituary|publisher=[[The Times]]|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3612776.ece?token=null&offset=12|date=2008-03-25|accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

[[Image:Pete Best drumming.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Best performing in Maryland in 2006]]
In 1988, after twenty years of turning down all requests to play drums in public, Best finally relented, appearing at a Beatles convention in Liverpool. He and his brother, Roag, performed for the audience and afterward, his wife and mother told him, 'You don't know it, but you're going to go back into show business.'"<ref>http://www.thesouthern.com/entertainment/feature/article_87194d2b-7bd6-5f3a-ba63-c9fcca843e37.html</ref> Pete Best now regularly tours the world with The Pete Best Band, sharing the drumming with his younger brother Roag.<ref>[http://www.petebest.com/1988.asp Pete best homepage] petebest.com - Retrieved 21 November 2007</ref>
