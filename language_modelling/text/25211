The '''River Parrett''' flows through the counties of [[Dorset]] and [[Somerset]] in [[South West England]], from its [[source (river)|source]] in the Thorney Mills [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the hills around [[Chedington]] in Dorset. Flowing northwest through Somerset and the [[Somerset Levels]] to its mouth at [[Burnham-on-Sea]], into the [[Bridgwater Bay]] [[National Nature Reserves in England|Nature Reserve]] on the [[Bristol Channel]], the Parrett drains an area of {{convert|643|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}<U+2014>about 50&nbsp;per cent of Somerset's land area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/G3-02-BGNW-e-e.pdf|title=The Parrett Catchment Water Management Strategy Action Plan|year=2002|publisher=Environment Agency|page=13|format=PDF|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors=T.

The Parrett's main tributaries include the Rivers [[River Tone|Tone]], [[River Isle|Isle]], and [[River Yeo (South Somerset)|Yeo]], and the [[River Cary]] via the [[King's Sedgemoor Drain]].

Many approaches have been tried since the early 19th century to reduce the incidence and effect of floods and to drain the surrounding fields.

During the [[Britannia (Roman province)|Roman]] era the river was crossed by a ford, and in [[Anglo-Saxon]] times formed a boundary between [[Wessex]] and [[Dumnonia]]. From the medieval period the river served the Port of Bridgwater, enabling cargoes to be transported inland. The arrival of the railways led to a decline and commercial shipping now only docks at [[Dunball]]. Man's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The [[River Parrett Trail]] has been established along the banks of the river.

== Course ==
The River Parrett is {{convert|37|mi|km|0}} long, flowing roughly south to north from [[Dorset]] through Somerset. Its [[source (river)|source]] is in the Thorney Mills [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] in the hills around [[Chedington]],<ref>{{harvnb|OS 193|2008|loc=section 48 05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=Spring/Summer 2006|title=Parrett People|publisher=Somerset levels and Moors Partnership|issue=13|pages=10|url=http://www.riverparrett-trail.org.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=298&type=full&servicetype=attachment}}</ref> {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}} from that of the [[River Axe (Lyme Bay)|River Axe]], in nearby [[Beaminster]], which runs in the opposite direction to the [[English Channel]] at [[Axmouth]] in Devon. The two rivers give their names to Parrett and Axe Parish Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parrettandaxe.org.uk/|title=Welcome to Parrett & Axe Parish Council|publisher=Parrett & Axe Parish Council|accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref>

From its source, the Parrett runs north through [[South Perrott]] and under the [[West of England Main Line|Salisbury to Exeter railway line]] before passing to the west of [[North Perrott]] and [[Haselbury Plucknett]].<ref name=trail>''The River Parrett Trail&nbsp;<U+2013> Following a river from source to mouth'', (1997), Tourism and Marketing Unit, South Somerset District Council</ref> It then runs through fields between [[Merriott]] to the west and [[West Chinnock]] and [[Chiselborough]] to the east. Passing under the [[A303 road]] to the east of [[South Petherton]], the river flows between [[East Lambrook]] and [[Bower Hinton]] west of [[Martock]] and then towards [[Kingsbury Episcopi]], through [[Thorney, Somerset|Thorney]] and [[Muchelney]], passing the remains of [[Muchelney Abbey]] before entering [[Langport]], which is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Chiselborough. Below Thorney Bridge the river's banks have been raised to mitigate flooding.<ref name=trail/>

The Parrett then flows northwest for approximately another {{convert|10|mi|km}} to Bridgwater through the [[Somerset Levels]] past [[Aller, Somerset|Aller]], close to the [[Aller and Beer Woods]] and [[Aller Hill]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). The sluice gate (formerly a [[Canal lock|lock]] built in the late 1830s) at the [[deserted medieval village]] of Oath marks the river's tidal limit.<ref name="eelodyssey"/><ref name="Paper by the Enviornment Agency">{{cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/council/board10/2005%20December%2013%20Item%205%20Environment%20Agency%20Paper.htm|title=Paper by the Environment Agency|work=Somerset County Council Scrutiny Committee|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref><ref name="hadfield83-91">{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1967|pp=83<U+2013>91}}</ref> The river then crosses [[Southlake Moor]].

Further downstream the river passes the village of [[Huntworth]] before flowing under the [[M5 motorway]] at Dunwear. As it enters Bridgwater it passes under Somerset and Hamp Bridges, and past [[Bridgwater Castle]] which had a tidal [[moat]] up to {{convert|65|ft|m|0}} wide in places, fed by water from the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgwater.net/Town/About_Town/History/bridgwater_castle.htm|title=Bridgwater Castle|publisher=Bridgwater.net|accessdate=12 October 2008}}</ref> From Bridgwater to the sea is approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}}. The [[King's Sedgemoor Drain]] drains into the River Parrett next to the wharf at Dunball; it enters via a [[Sluice|clyce]] (or clyse), which is a local word for a sluice. The clyce has been moved about {{convert|0.3|mi|m|sigfig=1}} downstream from its original position and now obstructs the entrance to the small harbour next to the wharf.<ref name="otter">{{harvnb|Otter|1994|pp=94<U+2013>100}}</ref>

Beyond the river are white concrete block buildings and multiple electricity pylons.|thumb|The river near [[Pawlett]] showing [[Hinkley Point]] power stations [[Hinkley Point A nuclear power station|A]] and [[Hinkley Point B nuclear power station|B]]]]
The course of the river below Bridgwater is now somewhat straighter than in former times. The village of [[Combwich]] lies adjacent to a channel in the river known as "Combwich Reach"; from here the Parrett flows to the [[Bristol Channel]] past the [[Steart Peninsula]]. [[Cartography|Cartographic]] evidence indicates that in the early 18th century the peninsula was longer than present.<ref name="mcdonnell">{{cite journal |editor=Bell, Martin |journal=Archaeology in the Severn Estuary: Annual Report |year=1995 |volume= 6 |publisher=Severn Estuary Levels Research Committee |last=McDonnell |first=Richard |title=Island evolution in Bridgwater bay and the Parrett Estuary: an historical geography |pages=71<U+2013>83}}</ref> A "neck" started to form in the peninsula and by 1802 the tip had broken off to form Stert Island.<ref name="mcdonnell"/> Fenning Island also broke away but has rejoined the peninsula.<ref name="mcdonnell"/>  Much of the peninsular's northern end eroded away or now exists as "islands" visible at low tides within an [[intertidal]] area of mud known as the Stert Flats.<ref name="mcdonnell"/>

The mouth at [[Burnham-on-Sea]] is a [[National Nature Reserves in England|nature reserve]] where the river flows into [[Bridgwater Bay]] on the Bristol Channel. In addition to the rivers Parrett, [[River Brue|Brue]] and [[Washford River|Washford]], several of the man-made drainage ditches, including the [[River Huntspill]] from the Somerset Levels, and the Cannington Brook from the "[[Pawlett, Somerset|Pawlett]] Hams", also discharge into the bay.<ref name=sssicitation/>

=== Flow and tidal bore ===
The Parrett has only one gauging station, at Chiselborough, fairly close to the source. It measures flow from the first {{convert|29|sqmi}} of the [[drainage basin]], or about 4.3&nbsp;per cent of the total.  The mean flow measured by the [[Environment Agency]] at Chiselborough was {{convert|67.45|cuft/s|m3/s}}, with a peak of {{convert|6109|cuft/s|m3/s}} on 30 May 1979 and a minimum of {{convert|2.5|cuft/s|m3/s}} on 22 August 1976. Tributaries of the Parrett with gauging stations include the Yeo, Isle, Cary, and Tone.<ref name="hydoreg">{{harvnb|Marsh|Hannaford|2008|p=128}}</ref>

The lower Parrett has a fall of only {{convert|1|ft/mi|m/km|1}} between Langport and Bridgwater;<ref name="edpack"/> and it drains into the Bristol Channel. To the northeast of the River Parrett's mouth, the Bristol Channel becomes the [[Severn Estuary]], which has a [[tidal range]] of {{convert|14|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.severnestuary.net/sep/pdfs/barker_06_final_project_report.pdf|title=Managing Tidal Change Natasha Barker Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship Award 2006 Final Project Report |last=Barker|first=Natasha|date=March 2008|work=Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Travelling Fellowship Award 2006|publisher=Severn Estuary Partnership |pages=8|accessdate=8 May 2010}}</ref>  The rate and direction of flow of the Parrett is therefore dependent on the state of the tide on the [[River Severn]]. In common with the lower reaches of the River Severn, the Parrett experiences a [[tidal bore]]. Certain combinations of the tides funnel the rising water into a wave that travels upstream at about {{convert|6|mph|km/h|0}}, against the river's current.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bridgwatersomerset.info/history_5_the_docks.php |last=Evans |first=Roger |title=The Docks|work=History|publisher=Bridgwater Somerset.info|accessdate=1 February 2009|isbn=0907768768}}</ref>

== History ==
The origin of the name Parrett is unclear, but several derivations from the [[Celtic languages]] used in [[Wales]] have been suggested. Priestley-Evans suggests "Parrett has been said to be a form of the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pared'', a partition, and that it was the name which the Welsh people of Somerset and Devon gave to that river because it was at one time the dividing line between themselves and the Saxons".<ref>{{harvnb|Priestley Evans|1931|p=6}}</ref> Another spelling ''parwydydd'' is also translated as partition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geiriadur.net/index.php?page=ateb&term=parwydydd&direction=we&type=all&whichpart=exact|title=Department of Welsh|publisher=University of Wales, Lampeter|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Another explanation from Welsh ''Peraidd'' meaning ''the sweet or delicious river'', has also been suggested.<ref>{{harvnb|Arthur|1857|p=213}}</ref> An alternative explanation, based on [[Old English]], is a derivation from ''Pedair'' or ''Pedride'' from ''pedr'' meaning four and the [[Cornish language|Old Cornish]] ''Rit'' meaning flow, which in this case would relate to the four flows or streams: the Tone, Yeo, Isle and Parrett.<ref name="crowden (1996)">{{harvnb|Crowden|1996|p=133}}</ref> This is based on the explanation given in Ekwall's 1928 book ''English River Names''.<ref>{{harvnb|Ekwall|1928|pp=320<U+2013>322}}</ref> Whichever derivation is correct, the name Parrett and its spelling variations have been in use since the [[Anglo-Saxon]] era, as evidenced by the addition of ''-tun'' onto river names as seen in the local towns [[North Petherton]] and South Petherton.<ref>{{harvnb|Costen|1992|p=37}}</ref>

There is evidence of two Roman [[port]]s on the Parrett. The port, at Combwich on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion.

The Parrett was established as the border between the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of [[Wessex]] and the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] in 658, following the Dumnonians' defeat at the [[Battle of Peonnum]] that year.<ref>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=63}}</ref><ref name="Hawkins 1982 36">{{harvnb|Hawkins|1982|p=36}}</ref> This natural border endured for almost a century until further fighting between the Anglo-Saxons and Britons in the mid-8th century, when the border shifted west to its current location between the modern [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] of Somerset and [[Devon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunning|2002|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> It is thought a [[ford]], usable only at low tide, crossed the river near its mouth, between Combwich and Pawlett (east bank).

After the departure of the Romans, the low-lying Somerset Levels appear to have been abandoned, as the [[archaeological record]] shows that they were flooded and the former Roman landscape covered with a thick layer of [[alluvial]] deposits.<ref name="rippon-178">{{Harvnb|Rippon|1997|page=178}}</ref> Recovery of the levels involved both the construction of sea walls and the containment of the Parrett.<ref name="rippon-178"/> [[Celtic Christianity]] came to the remoter areas of the Somerset Levels, making use of "island" sites. [[Glastonbury Abbey]], possibly founded in the 7th century (or earlier), was nearby and had undertaken extensive water management to enable it to bring materials by boat to Glastonbury, albeit not via the Parrett. Muchelney Abbey, founded in the mid 8th century,<ref name="williams-2">{{Harvnb|Williams|1970|pp=6<U+2013>24}}</ref> was sited at the confluence of the Parrett and its tributaries, the rivers [[River Isle|Isle]] and Yeo; and [[Athelney Abbey]] lay on another tributary, the [[River Tone]].<ref name="hollinrakes"/> These three abbeys together with the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] were major landowners with fishing and [[riparian]] rights, often conflicting, on these rivers. They gained financially from improvements to land and waterways due to the improved fertility of their lands and the increased [[renting|rents]] that they were able to change their tenants.<ref name="hollinrakes"/><ref name="williams-3"/>

[[File:Southlakemoor.jpg|alt=Photograph from elevation of flooded river flowing between snow covered fields. Hills in the distance.|thumb|right|The flooded [[Southlake Moor]] in the winter of 1985]]
Continuing land reclamation and control of the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by improvement. Work was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the [[medieval period]] by Glastonbury Abbey.<ref name="williams-3">{{Harvnb|Williams|1970|pp=25<U+2013>81}}</ref> Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed {{convert|722|acre}} of [[meadow]] recovered around the "island" of Sowy; and, from the accounts in the Abbey's [[Renting|rent]] books, this had increased to {{convert|972|acre}} by 1240.<ref name="williams-3"/> Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall.<ref name="williams-3"/> The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney, and other land owners, into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence.<ref name="hollinrakes"/><ref name="williams-3"/> After the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came under the control of the Crown, particularly [[King's Sedgemoor]] which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey; with the Court of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage, and various Commissions responsible for land improvements.<ref name="williams-4"/> Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500&nbsp;years. In 1597, {{convert|50|acre}} of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later {{convert|140|acre}} near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; and three further reclamations, totalling {{convert|110|acre}}, were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660.<ref name="williams-4">{{Harvnb|Williams|1970|pp=82<U+2013>122}}</ref> Kings [[James I of England|James I]], [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] continued to improve King's Sedgemoor.<ref name="williams-4"/>

Attempts were also made to improve navigation on the lower river.

[[Dunball]] wharf was built in 1844 by Bridgwater coal merchants,<ref name="somharbours-116">{{Harvnb|Farr|1954|p=116}}</ref> and was formerly linked to the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] by a rail track which crossed the [[A38 road|A38]].

The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, which been bought out by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866 and subsequently passed into the control of the [[Great Western Railway]] had, by the beginning of the [[First World War]], fallen into disrepair due to lack of trade. This, particularly the Wales-Somerset traffic with the opening of the [[Severn Tunnel]] in 1886, had been lost to the railways; although the canal was still used as a source of water.<ref name= haskell-ch-9>{{Harvnb |Haskell|2007| pages=154<U+2013>188}}</ref> In the mid 1950s, the Port of Bridgwater was importing some {{convert|80050|to|106800|tonne}} of cargo; mainly sand and coal by tonnage, followed by timber and [[flour]].<ref name="somharbours-114">{{Harvnb|Farr|1954|p=114}}</ref> It was also exporting some {{convert|7300|tonne}} of bricks and tiles.<ref name="somharbours-114"/> By then, Bridgwater's brick and tile industry was in terminal decline.

=== Parrett Navigation ===
{{River Parrett map}}

The Parrett Navigation was a series of improvements to the river to allow increased boat traffic between Burrowbridge and Thorney. The work, done in the 1830s and 1840s, was made mostly obsolete by the coming of railways in 1853, though some aspects survive to this day.

==== Background ====
Trade on the river upstream of Bridgwater had developed during the 18th&nbsp;century, with {{convert|20|long ton|adj=on}} barges operating between Bridgwater and Langport, while smaller barges carrying {{convert|6|to|7|long ton}} operated on the upper reaches between Langport and Thorney, and along the [[River Yeo (South Somerset)|River Yeo]] to Long Load Bridge and Ilchester.<ref name="body3-4">{{Harvnb|Body|Gallop|2006|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> The channel below the junction with the [[River Tone]] had been improved as a result of Acts of Parliament passed in 1699 and 1707, "for making and keeping the River Tone navigable from Bridgewater to Taunton", and a third act with a similar purpose was passed in 1804.<ref name=priestley638>{{harvnb|Priestley|1969|p=638}}</ref> Traffic on the higher reaches was hindered by [[shoal]]s in the river, and by the Great Bow Bridge at Langport, which consisted on nine small arches, none of them big enough for navigation. All cargoes heading upstream had to be off-loaded from the bigger barges, carried to the other side of the bridge, and reloaded into the smaller barges. Traffic above Langport was sporadic, as the water levels were often inadequate, forcing boats to wait several days for the right conditions before proceeding.<ref name=body10-12>{{Harvnb|Body|Gallop|2006|pp=10<U+2013>12}}</ref>

The abortive [[Ivelchester and Langport Navigation]] scheme had sought to avoid the Great Bow Bridge, by making the Portlake Rhine navigable, rebuilding Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport, and making a new cut to Bicknell's Bridge. Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned but the scheme foundered in 1797, due to financial difficulties.<ref name="body13-15"/> After the cessation of hostilities with France at the beginning of the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the [[Bridgwater and Taunton Canal]] was authorised in 1824,<ref name=priestley093>{{harvnb|Priestley|1969|p=93}}</ref> the [[Glastonbury Canal]] in 1827,<ref>{{harvnb|Dunning|2002|pp=100<U+2013>101}}</ref> and the [[Chard Canal]] in 1834.<ref name="hadfield66-71">{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1967|pp=66<U+2013>71}}</ref>

When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was opened in 1827 it joined the Parrett by a lock at [[Huntworth]], where a [[Canal basin|basin]] was constructed, but in 1841 the canal was extended to the new floating harbour in Bridgwater, and the Huntworth link was filled in.<ref name="hadfield55-56">{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1967|pp=55<U+2013>56}}</ref> The canal and river were not re-connected at this point when the canal was restored,<ref>{{harvnb|OS-Nicholson|2003|p=30}}</ref> because the tidal Parrett, at Huntworth, is a [[Brackish water|salt water]] river laden with silt, whereas the canal contains [[fresh water]]. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of [[drinking water]] for Bridgwater's population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wow4water.net/media/images/2007116111743.pdf|title=Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Information Pack|work=Wow4Water|publisher=British Waterways|pages=4|accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>

==== Construction ====
With the prospect of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and [[Walter Bagehot]], who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]] and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses  in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus water would be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.<ref name=body13-15/>

The Parrett Navigation Act allowed the proprietors, of which 25 were named, to raise <U+00A3>10,500 in shares and <U+00A3>3,300 by mortgage, with which to make improvements to the river from Burrow Bridge to Langport, to reconstruct the restrictive bridge at Langport, and to continue the improvements as far as Thorney. The [[River Isle]], which joined the Parrett at [[Muchelney]], was to be improved for its first mile, and then the [[Westport Canal]] was to be constructed from there to [[Westport, Somerset|Westport]]. Locks were planned at Stanmoor, Langport, and Muchelney, with a half-lock at Thorney.<ref name="hadfield83-91"/> An extra lock was added at [[Oath, Somerset|Oath]], when tests revealed that the depth of water would not meet that specified in the Act without it. Costs were considerably higher than expected, and a second Act of Parliament was obtained in 1839, to allow an extra <U+00A3>20,000 to be raised.<ref name="hadfield83-91"/><ref name="body13-15">{{Harvnb|Body|Gallop|2006|pp=13<U+2013>15}}</ref><ref name="body16-20">{{Harvnb|Body|Gallop|2006|pp=16<U+2013>20}}</ref> The lock at Oath has since been replaced by a sluice gate to control flooding.<ref name="Paper by the Enviornment Agency"/>

The section below Langport was completed and opened on 28 October 1839; the section to Thorney and the Westport Canal were completed in August 1840.<ref name="hadfield83-91"/> The Langport Bridge was not finished until March 1841; of the <U+00A3>3,749 cost of construction, <U+00A3>500 came from the Langport Corporation and the rest was raised by a bridge toll operated from March 1841 until January 1843. The total cost of the works was <U+00A3>38,876, and no dividends were paid until 1853, as all profits were used to repay the loans which had been taken out. There are no records of traffic, but it has been estimated at {{convert|60000|to|70000|long ton}} per year, based on the toll receipts and the knowledge that the Stuckey and Bagehot boats carried about three quarters of the total tonnage.<ref name=body16-20/>

==== Decline ====
The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened in late 1853, and the effects on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite petitions from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only.<ref name=russell-65-66>{{Harvnb|Russell|1971|pp=65<U+2013>66}}</ref> Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until the early years of the 20th century.<ref name="hadfield83-91"/> There is still a public right of navigation as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.<ref>{{harvnb|OS-Nicholson|2003|p=25}}</ref>

== Bridges and structures ==
Much of the history of the river has been defined by its bridges, which are described from mouth to source. The Drove Bridge, which marks the current extent of the Port of Bridgwater is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river. With a span of {{convert|184|ft|m}}, the bridge was constructed as part of the Bridgwater Northern Distributor road scheme (1992), and provides a navigable channel which is {{convert|66|ft|m}} wide with {{convert|8.2|ft|m}} headroom at normal spring high tides.<ref name=DroveBridge>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19950270_en_3.htm#end|title=Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 270, NDR confirmation order|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> Upstream of this is the [[retractable bridge]] built in 1871 to the design of [[Sir Francis Fox]], the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a [[broad gauge]] (later a [[standard gauge]]) railway siding over the river to the docks, but had to be movable, to allow boats to proceed upriver. An {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways, so that the main {{convert|127|ft|m|adj=on}} girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was {{convert|78|ft|m}} wide.<ref name="otter"/> It was manually operated for the first eight months, and then powered by a steam engine, reverting to manual operation in 1913, when the steam engine failed. The bridge was last opened in 1953, and the traverser section was demolished in 1974, but public outcry at the action resulted in the bridge being listed as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]], and the rest of the bridge was kept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=11837|title=Rail bridge over River Parrett, Bridgwater|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> It was later used as a road crossing, until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it, and is now only used by pedestrians. Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977.<ref name=otter/>

The next bridge is the Town Bridge. There has been a bridge here since the 13th century, when Bridgwater was granted a charter by [[John of England|King John]]. The present bridge was designed by R. C. Else and G. B.

Before 1826, the bridge at [[Burrowbridge]], just below the junction with the [[River Tone]], consisted of three arches, each only a little wider than the barges which used the river. They restricted the flow of water in times of flood, and made navigation difficult. The bridge was highlighted in a report made by William Armstrong in 1824, as a factor which would prevent the River Tone Navigation competing with the new Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, then being built.<ref>{{Harvnb |Haskell|2007| p=32}}</ref> An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1824 by the Turnpike Commissioners, authorising the construction of a new bridge and the removal of the old. A design for a 70-foot (21&nbsp;m) single span bridge in [[cast iron]] was dropped because of the cost of cast iron at the time, and instead a stone bridge was built, which was completed in 1826.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haskell|2007|p=110}}</ref><ref name="completesomerset">{{harvnb|Bush|1994|pp=65<U+2013>66}}</ref> This is the longest single span masonry road bridge in the county, and was also the last [[toll bridge]] in Somerset, until it was 'freed' in 1946.<ref name="curio"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=271175 |title=Burrow Bridge at NGR ST 3075 |accessdate=30 November 2008 |work=Images of England |publisher=English Heritage |date= }}</ref> It now carries the [[A361 road]]. Just below the bridge there was a shoal of rocks and stones, which was also mentioned in Armstrong's report, but no action was taken to remove it.

Above here, horses were used to pull the boats, either towards Langport or along the River Tone towards Taunton.<ref name="Haskell" />

At Langport, the Great Bow Bridge, which now carries the [[A378 road (Great Britain)|A378]], is a three-arched bridge, constructed under the terms of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836.

This sluice regulates the flow of water between the River Parrett and the [[Sowy River]] (the River Parrett Relief Channel).]]
The waters of the [[Severn Estuary]], which are heavily laden with silt, flow into the lower reaches of the Parrett and the Tone on each tide. This silt can rapidly gather on the banks of the rivers reducing the capacity and performance of the channel, and increasing the risk of flooding of surrounding land.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parrettcatchment.info/what-we-are-doing/water/|title=Component 5: Dredging and maintaining river channels|publisher=Parrett Catchment Project|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

The river is technically a highland carrier, as it is embanked and the water level is often higher than that of the land through which it flows.<ref name="parrettcatchment">{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/pdf/G3-02-BGNW-e-e.pdf|title=The Parrett Catchment Water Management Strategy Action Plan|year=2002|publisher=Environment Agency|pages=15|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, and drainage schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at [[Westonzoyland]] was built in 1830, the first [[pump|mechanical pumping station]] on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, [[Middlezoy]] and [[Othery]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=15118#s22 |title=Westonzoyland |accessdate=2 December 2008 |work=Victoria County History |publisher=British History Online |date= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927223419/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=15118#s22 |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref> and the success of the [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] led to the formation of [[Internal drainage board]]s and the construction of other [[pumping station]]s.

The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a [[beam engine]] and [[scoop wheel]], which is similar to a water wheel, except that it is driven round by the engine and lifts water up to a higher level. After 25&nbsp;years, there were problems pumping the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15118|title=Westonzoyland | work= A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 8: The Poldens and the Levels | year=2004 | pages=190<U+2013>210|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> A better method was sought, and in 1861 a replacement pump was installed.

The Somerset River Authority was established in the 1960s, and later became part of [[Wessex Water]]. Tidal models were used to explore the relationship between any improvement to the river to reduce the likelihood of flooding and subsequent silting reducing the effects.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Jack|date=December 1942|title=Schemes of Improvement for the River Parrett : An Investigation with the Aid of a Tidal Model|journal=Journal of the Institute of Civil Engineers|volume=19|issue=2|pages=85<U+2013>99|doi=10.1680/ijoti.1942.13845}}</ref> Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and [[River Brue]] systems, in an attempt to ensure that agricultural land benefited from a potable water supply in the groundwaters from the [[Quantock Hills]] to the coastline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parrettcatchment.info/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=1926&type=full&servicetype=Attachment|title=Future Organisational Structure for the Levels and Moors and Parrett Catchment|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref>

Various measures including [[sluice gates]], or clyce, have been deployed to try and control flooding. Completed in 1972, the [[Sowy River]] is a {{convert|7.5|mi|km|adj=on}} embanked channel which starts at Monks Leaze clyce below Langport, and carries excess water from the river to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain, from where it flows to the estuary by gravity, rejoining the Parrett near Dunball wharf. Construction of the channel, together with improvements to the Kings Sedgemoor Drain and the rebuilding of the clyce at Dunball, to create a fresh water seal which prevents salt water entering the drain from the river, cost <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;million.<ref name=otter/> The scheme has resulted in less flooding on Aller Moor.<ref name="parrettcatchment"/>

In the 1970s a study was commissioned by Wessex Water to investigate the likely effects of constructing a tide-excluding barrier, aimed at stopping the silt, just upriver of Dunball Wharf on the hydraulic, sedimentary and pollutant regime of the estuary.

The area around the estuary, known as Parrett Reach, around the Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. As a result, the [[Environment Agency]], a [[non-departmental public body]] of the UK government's [[Defra|Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], produced the [[Stolford]] to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study in 2002, to examine options for the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/stolford_to_combwich.pdf.pdf |title=Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study |accessdate=31 October 2007 |format=PDF |work=Environment Agency |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927182252/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/stolford_to_combwich.pdf.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref> In July 2010 the Environment Agency presented plans to convert the peninsula into wetland habitat, if the proposed scheme goes ahead it will be the largest wetland habitat creation scheme in England.<ref>{{cite news|title=Plans to flood Steart peninsula to create wetlands|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10513811|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 July 2010 | date=5 July 2010}}</ref>

Following summer floods of 1997 and the prolonged flooding of 1999/2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly funded by the [[European Union]] [[European Regional Development Fund|Regional Development Fund]], by 30 organisations, including; [[British Waterways]], [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]], [[The Countryside Agency]], [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], [[Environment Agency]], Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]], [[Sedgemoor]], [[Somerset County Council]], [[South Somerset District Council]], [[Taunton Deane]] and Wessex Water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parrettcatchment.info/who-we-are/|title=Who we are|publisher=Parrett Catchment Project|accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> They aim to tackle 12&nbsp;areas, which, when combined, will make a significant contribution to reducing the adverse effects of flooding.

== Geology ==

Close to the source the underlying [[geology]] is a thin layer of [[Fuller's earth]] clay over [[Yeovil sand]]s; the resulting light soil made the area important for the production of flax and for market gardening in the past.<ref name="trail"/>

[[File:BurrowBridgeView2.jpg|thumb|alt=Water on grassy lowland with hills in the distance.|View from the summit of [[Burrow Mump]] across the winter-flooded [[Somerset levels]] toward [[Aller Hill]] and the village of [[Aller, Somerset]].]]
[[Burrow Mump]], an ancient earthwork owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]],<ref name="curio"/> is a natural hill of [[Triassic]] [[sandstone]] capped by [[Keuper marl]], standing at a strategic point where the [[River Tone]] and the old course of the [[River Cary]] join the River Parrett.

The Levels and Moors are a largely flat area in which there are some slightly raised parts, called "burtles"<ref name="natengsomerset">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/geological/sites/area_ID30.asp |title=Somerset |accessdate=10 June 2007 |work=Natural England }}</ref> as well as higher ridges and hills.  It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of [[Permanent vegetative cover|permanent]] [[grass]], surrounded by ditches lined with [[willow]] trees. Access to the Levels and Moors is by [[Drovers' road|"droves"]], i.e. green lanes. The Levels are a coastal sand and clay barrier about {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} above mean sea level (roughly west of the M5 motorway) whereas the inland Moors can be {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} below peak tides and have large areas of [[peat]].  The [[geology]] of the area is that of two basins mainly surrounded by hills, the runoff from which forms rivers that originally meandered across the plain but have now been controlled by embanking and [[Sluice#Regional names for sluice gates|clyces]].  The area is prone to winter floods of fresh water and occasional salt water inundations which have occurred, the worst of which in recorded history was the [[Bristol Channel floods, 1607|Bristol Channel floods of 1607]], which resulted in the drowning of an estimated 2,000 or more people, with houses and villages swept away, an estimated {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|-1|lk=on}} of farmland inundated and livestock destroyed.<ref name="bbcsom">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2007/01/30/somerset_flood_1607_anniversary_feature.shtml |title=The great flood of 1607: could it happen again? |accessdate=20 February 2008 |work=BBC Somerset |publisher=[[BBC]] }}</ref> A further severe flood occurred in 1872<U+2013>1873 when over {{convert|107|sqmi|km2|0}} were under water from October to March.<ref name="havinden">{{harvnb|Havinden|1982|pp=149<U+2013>170}}</ref>

The extraction of [[peat]] from the Moors is known to have taken place during [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, and has been an ongoing practice since the levels were first drained. The introduction of plastic packaging in the 1950s allowed the peat to be packed without rotting. This led to the industrialisation of peat extraction during the 1960s as a major market in [[horticulture|horticultural]] peat was developed. The reduction in water levels that resulted put local [[ecosystem]]s at risk; peat wastage in pasture fields was occurring at rates of 1<U+2013>3&nbsp;ft (0.3<U+2013>0.8&nbsp;m) over 100&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&cp=1-26-45-87^16182_4000_0__ |title=Peat Wastage and Wetland Archaeology |accessdate=21 November 2009 |work=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands }}</ref>

From January until May, the Parrett provides a source of [[European Eel]]s (''Anguilla anguilla'') and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efishbusiness.co.uk/formsandguides/eel-elver-guidance.pdf | deadlink=yes |archiveurl=http://www.efishbusiness.co.uk/formsandguides/eel-elver-guidance.pdf | archivedate=8 January 2010|title=Environment Agency Eel and Elver Fishing Guidance|publisher=[[Environment Agency]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night.<ref name="eelodyssey"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2008/09/03/eels_feature.shtml|title=Groundbreaking project saves glass eels|date=4 September 2008|work=Nature Features|publisher=BBC Somerset|accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> The 2003 [[BBC Radio 4]] play ''[[Glass Eels (play)|Glass Eels]]'' by [[Nell Leyshon]] was set on the Parrett.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Spencer  | first = Charles  | authorlink =   | title =  Glass Eels&nbsp;<U+2013> a whirlpool of emotion  | work = The Telegraph  | date = 11/07/2007  | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/07/11/bteels111.xml  | accessdate =27 August 2008  | publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]] | location=London}}</ref>

To the north of the river bank northwest of Langport are the [[Aller and Beer Woods]] and [[Aller Hill]] [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]] reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural [[ancient woodland]] along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about {{convert|40|ha|acre}} and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias [[limestone]]. Prior to the 20th&nbsp;century it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional [[coppice]] woodland,<ref>{{cite web | title=Aller and Beer Woods | work=Wildlife Trusts | url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/aller_beer_woods | accessdate=11 November 2010}} </ref> and provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the Calcareous [[Ash tree|Ash]]/[[Wych Elm]] stand-type, with [[Pedunculate Oak]] (''Quercus robur''), and Ash (''Fraxinus excelsior'') the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of Wych Elm (''Ulmus glabra''). Ancient woodland indicators include [[Tilia cordata|Small-leaved Lime]] (''Tilia cordata''), and [[Wild Service Tree]] (''Sorbus torminalis''), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include [[Bird's Nest Orchid]] (''Neottia nidus-avis''), [[Greater Butterfly Orchid]] (''Platanthera chlorantha'') and the very rare Red Data Book species [[Purple Gromwell]] (''Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum'').<ref>{{cite web | title=Aller and Beer Woods | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003646.pdf | accessdate=12 August 2006}}</ref> Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by [[Sheep's Fescue]] (''Festuca ovina'') in combination with [[Yellow Oat-grass]] (''Trisetum flavescens'') and [[Briza media|Quaking-grass]] (''Briza media''). [[Salad Burnet]] (''Sanguisorba minor'') forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species [[Rough Marsh-mallow]] (''Althaea hirsuta'') and [[Nit-grass]] (''Gastridium ventricosum''), also present.<ref>{{cite web | title=Aller Hill | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1005494.pdf | accessdate=12 August 2006}}</ref>

[[Southlake Moor]] is another SSSI, which forms part of an extensive grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank.<ref name="southlake"/> Some 96&nbsp;species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the [[Sium latifolium|Greater water-parsnip]] (''Sium latifolium'').<ref name="southlake"/> When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 [[Eurasian Wigeon|Wigeon]] (''Anas penelope''), 250&nbsp;[[Bewick's Swan]] (''Cygnus bewickii'') and good numbers of [[Common Pochard|Pochard]] (''Aythya ferina''), [[Common Teal|Teal]] (''Anas crecca'') and [[Tufted Duck]] (''Aythya fuligula''). Signs of [[European Otter]]s (''Lutra lutra'') are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches on the east side of the site are populated by [[Palmate Newt]]s (''Triturus helveticus'').<ref name="southlake">{{cite web | title=Southlake Moor | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002426.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=21 August 2006}}</ref>

In the distance is a line of low hills.|thumb|Tidal mudflats at [[Combwich]], near the mouth of the River Parrett on [[Bridgwater Bay]].]]

[[Langmead and Weston Level]] is nationally important for its species-rich neutral [[grassland]] and the [[invertebrate]] community found in the ditches and rhynes. The terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates recorded on the site include four nationally
rare species: the [[Great Silver Diving Beetle]] (''Hydrophilus piceus''), the soldier fly ''[[Odontomyia ornata]]'', which is now called the ''Ornate Brigadier'',<ref>{{harvnb|Stubbs|Drake|2001|p=310}}</ref> and two other [[flies]], ''[[Lonchoptera scutellata]]'' and ''[[Stenomicra cogani]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Langmead and Weston Level | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1005918.pdf | accessdate=17 August 2006}}</ref>

The {{convert|47|mi|km|0|adj=on}} River Parrett Trail is a [[Long-distance footpaths in the UK|long-distance footpath]] following the Parrett from its source to the sea.<ref name="edpack"/> The river passes many landmarks and places of interest including: [[Burrow Hill Cider Farm]], Muchelney Abbey, [[West Sedgemoor]] (a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI), the [[Blake Museum]], Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum, the site of the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]] and finally discharging into Bridgwater Bay (another SSSI).<ref name=trail/> The Langport and River Parrett Visitor Centre located at Langport details local life, history and wildlife.<ref name="edpack"/>

Since 2000 attempts have been made to clarify the legal status and organisational responsibilities for the maintenance of the river and explore issues involving the sustainability and safe use of the waterway for a public trip boat and recreational craft. The work has identified economic and social benefits from the development of the Parrett navigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2.southsomerset.gov.uk/media/pdf/e/p/Langport_Navigation_Report_2.1_Dec_09.pdf|title=Report for Somerset Waterways Development Trust in partnership with the Langport River Group|year=2009|publisher=South Somerset Council|accessdate=11 November 2010}} </ref>
