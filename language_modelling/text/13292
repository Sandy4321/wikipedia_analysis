'''''Herzogin Cecilie''''' was a German four mast [[barque]] ([[Windjammer]]), named after German [[Crown Princess]] [[Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] (1886<U+2013>1954), spouse of [[Crown Prince]] [[Wilhelm of Prussia]] (1882<U+2013>1951).

== History ==
''Herzogin Cecilie'' was built in 1902 by Rickmers Schiffbau AG in [[Bremerhaven]]. She was yard number 122 and was launched on 22 April 1902. Completion was on 7 June that year.<ref name=Build>{{cite Miramar|id=5618260|accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref> She was {{convert|334|ft|8|in|m|2}} long, with a breadth of {{convert|46|ft|3|in|m|2}} and a draught of {{convert|24|ft|2|in|m|2}}.<ref name=Cecilie/> ''Herzogin Cecilie'' was built for [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] [[Bremen]]. Unlike other contemporary German merchant sailing ships, the black [[Flying-P-Liner]]s or the green ships of Rickmers, she was painted in white. She was one of the fastest [[windjammer]]s ever built: she has logged 21 [[knot_(unit)|knots]] at [[Skagen]].

The [[tall ship]]s of the time remained only competitive against the steamers on the longer trade routes: the Chilean ''[[Salpeterfahrt]]'' [[nitrate trade]], carrying [[salpeter]] from [[Chile]] to Europe, and the Australian ''[[Weizenfahrt]]'' [[wheat trade]], carrying grain from Australia to Europe. Both routes required rounding [[Cape Horn]] routinely, and were not well suited for steamers, as coal was short of supply there.

Herzogin Cecilie was one of the fastest merchant sailing ships of her time, on a par with the Flying-P-Liners. The trip around [[Cape Horn]] from [[Portland (Oregon)|Portland]] ([[Oregon]]) to [[The Lizard]] ([[England]]) was done in 1903 in only 106 days. 

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], she was interned by [[Chile]], returning to Germany in 1920, only to be given to  [[France]] as reparation, and subsequently sold to [[Gustaf Erikson]] (24 October 1872 - 15 August 1947) of [[Finland]] for $20,000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} She was homeported at [[Mariehamn]]<ref name=Cecilie/> 

As the freight rates for salpeter had dropped after the war, Gustaf Erikson sent her to bring grain from Australia. In so-called [[grain race]]s, several tall ships tried to arrive first in Europe, to sell their cargo for a higher price, as e.g. told in [[The Great Tea Race of 1866]], or in [[The Last Grain Race]]. Typically, ships were loaded in the [[Spencer Gulf]] area, [[Port Victoria, South Australia]] or [[Wallaroo, South Australia]], and traveled to Europe, with ports on the British Isles like [[Queenstown, Ireland]] or [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] being considered as the finish. 

After "winning" prior to 1921 four times, in eleven trips from 1926 to 1936, she again won the grain race four times.<ref name=Race>{{cite web|url=http://pamir.chez-alice.fr/Voiliers/Classe_A/Grainwe.htm |title=The grain races |publisher=Chez Alice |accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref>

In 1927, when Herzogin Cecilie covered [[Port Lincoln]] - Queenstown in 98 days, [[Alan Villiers]] was on board, which would result in his book "Falmouth for Orders", and later a trip aboard the barque [[Parma (barque)|''Parma'']].

After having traveled to Falmouth in only 86 days, second fastest ever, Herzogin Cecilie, when making for [[Ipswich]] in dense fog, on 25 April 1936 she grounded on Ham Stone Rock and drifted onto the cliffs of [[Bolt Head]]. After parts of the cargo was unloaded, she was floating again, only to be towed in June 1936 to Starhole (Starehole) bay at the mouth of the [[Kingsbridge Estuary]] near [[Salcombe]] and beached there. Soon afterwards the pounding of the waves broke her apart. The remains of the ship sit at a depth of 7 metres at {{Coord|50|12.82|N|3|47.02|W}}.

==Official Numbers and Code Letters==
Official Numbers were a forerunner to [[IMO ship identification number|IMO Numbers]]. ''Herzogin Cecilie'' had the Finnish Official Number 703 and used the [[Code Letters]] TPMK.<ref name=Cecilie>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30a0114.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VOILES |accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref>
