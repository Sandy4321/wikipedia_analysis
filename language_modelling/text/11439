'''Apache Bull Ramos''' was a professional wrestler from the 60s and 70s who primarily worked as a heel. He had notable feuds with [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Dutch Savage]], [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Terry Funk]] and [[Mil Mascaras]]. Ramos weighed over 300 pounds and was strong on promos. As a result, he was able to draw massive heat during his matches.
