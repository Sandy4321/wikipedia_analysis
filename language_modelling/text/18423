The '''Big Five''' are a group of five fictional businessmen that appear in the [[anime]] series [[Yu-Gi-Oh!]].

== Kaiba Corporation ==
Initially known at the Board of Directors for [[Kaiba Corporation]], the Big Five work for [[Gozaburo Kaiba]], producing [[weapons of mass destruction]]. When Gozaburo's step-son [[Seto Kaiba|Seto]] decides to make his play for power, he convinces the Big Five he'll restore them to their former power and claims that Gozaburo does not give them the respect or power they deserve. The Big Five agree, and thus buy 49% of Kaiba Corporation. Combined with 2% that Gozaburo had previously given to Seto for a test to prove his business skill, the Big Five vote out Gozaburo and vote in Seto as the president of the company.

However, Seto quickly backs out on their deal, stripping them of their power and leaving the Big Five little more than figureheads and consultants. Furious over their betrayal, the Big Five strike a deal with [[Maximillion Pegasus]], similar to their previous deal with Seto: if Pegasus defeats Seto and [[Yugi Mutou]] in duels, then they will use their 49% to vote Pegasus into power of the company by kidnapping Seto's brother [[Mokuba Kaiba|Mokuba]], who has been entrusted with the security codes to the two percent the Big Five need.

The plan fails, and when Seto learns of their betrayal, in the manga, Seto fires them. In the anime, Seto threatens to fire them.

== Second series anime-only plots ==
=== [[Legendary Heroes]] ===
The Big Five offer Seto his complete Virtual Reality game as a peace offering, sparking the [[Legendary Heroes]] arc. After being rescued, what Seto did to the Big Five is not known (the manga had them fired and they weren't seen again). Presumably their minds were trapped in the Virtual World as they had intended to do to Seto, as this sets the stage for their next appearance.

=== [[Virtual World (Yu-Gi-Oh! story arc)|Alliance With Noah]] ===

The Big Five wander Kaiba Corporation's computer banks for some time until they are found by Gozaburo's biological son [[Noah Kaiba|Noah]]. Noah also desires to take control of Kaiba Corporation from Seto, and the two strike a deal. Noah lures Seto, Yugi and his friends to an underwater military base, and there forces them to enter his version of the Virtual World. The Big Five greet them and reveal the deal they have made with Noah: after being trapped in the Virtual World, they have lost their connection to their bodies and thus need new ones. In exchange for being allowed access to the bodies of Seto, Yugi and his friends, the Big Five will defeat each of them in a duel to prove Noah and his employees are better than Kaiba and his friends.

One by one the Big Five fail to defeat their chosen opponents, and Noah is furious. As a last ditch effort, the Big Five use the body of [[Hiroto Honda|Tristan Taylor]] to unite into one and duel Yugi and [[Katsuya Jonouchi|Joey Wheeler]] in a two-on-one match. They once again fail to defeat them, and are summoned back to Noah's headquarters. Noah refuses to give them a third chance, and as punishment seals each of the Big Five in an isolated portion of the Virtual World. Following this they are never seen again and are presumably deleted when the fortress the Virtual World is stationed in explodes.

== Members in the second series anime ==
The names of the members are not known in the manga. The names only apply to the second series anime.

===Gansley===
'''Konosuke Oshita''' (<U+5927><U+4E0B> <U+5E78><U+4E4B><U+52A9> <U+014C>shita K<U+014D>nosuke) / '''Gansley''' - Gansley is the former KaibaCorp vice president, and leader/founder of the Big Five. He chooses to duel Yugi, and claims to have perfected a strategy to defeat him. He approaches the duel as a business, referring to his monsters as his employees. During the duel Gansley gives Yugi advice on business while in the Japanese version, Oshita quotes various warlords and philosophers on how to build a successful army. Gansley's deck relies on summoning many monsters to use the ability of his Deck Master '''Deep Sea Warrior''', whose Deck Master ability '''Reflector Hole''' can reflect attacks at the cost of sacrificing two monsters on the field.

An interesting change between the English and Japanese versions of the anime is that while Oshita knows about Yami Yugi (he refers to Yugi as Type-A Yugi and Yami Yugi as Type-B), Gansley shows no knowledge of the spirit.

===Crump===
'''Shuzo Otaki''' (<U+5927><U+6EDD> <U+4FEE><U+4E09> <U+014C>taki Sh<U+016B>z<U+014D>) / '''Adrian Rudolph Crump III''' - Crump used to be an accountant and oversaw Kaiba Corporation's finances before he was fired. He takes the form of '''Nightmare Penguin''' (which is also his Deck Master) to duel [[Anzu Mazaki|T<U+00E9>a Gardner]] (in the Japanese version, Otaki makes a few perverted comments during the duel that are cut in the English adaption). Crump was neglected as a child and found a love for penguins when he read about how they cared for their young. His dream was to build a penguin theme park, but Seto Kaiba refused to finance the project. Crump's deck relies on various penguin and ice monsters, increasing their attack points using his deck masters ability. His monsters generally lack special abilities, but he supplements them with Spells and Traps, opting for a numerical strategy of brute power.

===Johnson===
'''Chikuzen Oka''' (<U+5927><U+5CA1> <U+7B51><U+524D> <U+014C>ka Chikuzen) / '''Johnson''' - Johnson is the legal advisor for the Big Five and an expert lawyer. He duels Joey Wheeler in a courtroom setting. Johnson claims that Joey is on trial for gambling too much with his deck and takes the form of '''Judge Man''' to duel. During the duel Johnson rigs Joey's coin flips and dice rolls in his favor, until Noah steps in and threatens to disqualify him for cheating. Joey asks that Noah let the duel continue, and Noah does so. Joey plays another game of chance with Johnson in which he loses one of the true or false questions he claims to be an expert in, and thus loses the duel. Johnson's deck relies on increasing his Life Points to use his Deck Master's ability '''Clear the Courtroom''' (''Death Sentence''), which can destroy all monsters on the opposing field at a cost of 1000 points. His primary method involves the combination of ''Sinister Justice'' and ''Leading Question'' with Fusion cards: the two cards increase the power of Fusion monsters and also give Johnson extra Life Points whenever a Fusion monster attacks.

===Nesbitt===
'''Soichiro Ota''' (<U+5927><U+7530> <U+7DCF><U+4E00><U+90CE> <U+014C>ta S<U+014D>ichir<U+014D>) / '''Nesbitt''' - Nesbitt was the technical expert of the Big Five, and before Seto took power he oversaw the military factories on Kaiba Corp Isle. Seto ordered Nesbitt to destroy his lab after coming to power and had him build the Duel Tower in its place. Nesbitt is furious over his technological genius being used for games, and has vowed revenge. Nesbitt takes the form of '''Robotic Knight''' and later '''Perfect Machine King''' to duel [[Ryuji Otogi|Duke Devlin]], [[Shizuka Kawai|Serenity Wheeler]] and Tristan Taylor in a three-on-one duel. As Tristan and Serenity have little knowledge of dueling, Nesbitt is sure he'll win easily. He manages to defeat Tristan before losing, and claims his body in the process. Nesbitt's deck uses various Machine cards where he discards them to use his Deck Master ability called '''Final Artillery''' which does 500 damage each time he discards a Machine monster. His main monster ''Machine King'', which gains 100 points for every Machine on the field, is further enhanced via ''Clockwork Knight'', which turns all monsters on the field into Machines, and ''Short Circuit'' which forces all opposing monsters into attack position. These two cards in tandem effectively power up Machine King to near unstoppable levels.

===Lector===
'''Kogoro Daimon''' (<U+5927><U+9580> <U+5C0F><U+4E94><U+90CE> Daimon Kogor<U+014D>) / '''Lector''' - Lector is the former assistant to Gozaburo himself (and later Seto). Lector is the best duelist of the Big Five and challenges Seto as his opponent, intending to settle a personal grudge. Lector claims that he did all the hard work to make Seto look good for Gozaburo while all Seto did was give him orders. Lector also reveals Seto's manipulation of Mokuba to oust Gozaburo from power, which Seto denies. Lector uses a Control deck and utilizes a wide array of cards that lockdown the opponent's abilities at the cost of his own Life Points such as ''Imperial Order'' and ''Injection Fairy Lily'' (''Injection Angel Lily''), with his strategy highlighted by his Deck Master '''Jinzo''', which negates and destroys all his opponent's Trap cards.
