The village of '''Santikhiri''' ({{lang-th|<U+0E2A><U+0E31><U+0E19><U+0E15><U+0E34><U+0E04><U+0E35><U+0E23><U+0E35>}}), formerly known as '''Mae Salong''' ({{lang-th|<U+0E41><U+0E21><U+0E48><U+0E2A><U+0E25><U+0E2D><U+0E07>}}), is situated on the mountain of Doi Mae Salong, in [[Amphoe Mae Fa Luang|Mae Fa luang district]], [[Chiang Rai Province]], the northernmost province of [[Thailand]]. The area has an [[Alpine climate|alpine]]-like landscape and climate, and is known for its [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|hill tribe]] villages, tea plantations and [[cherry blossoms]].

Santikhiri's early history centered around the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]'s [[opium]] trade, in which its distinctive population &ndash; the "lost army" of the [[Republic of China Army]]'s 93rd [[Division (military)|Division]] &ndash; became involved. At the conclusion of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, some remnants of the anti-communist [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) forces refused to surrender, including the 93rd Division, led by General Tuan Shi-wen (also known as Chiwan Khamlue).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shanland.org/general/NinP/The-Kuomintang | title = The Kuomintang | accessdate = 2007-07-01 | publisher = Shan Herald Agency for News dated 26 Jul 2005 }}</ref> The division fought its way out of [[Yunnan]] in southwestern China, and its soldiers lived nomadic lives in Burma's (now [[Myanmar]]) jungles before seeking [[asylum]] in Mae Salong. In exchange for their asylum, they fought for Thailand until 1982, helping to counter the [[communist]] insurgency at the Thai frontier. In reward, the [[Politics of Thailand|Thai government]] granted citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families.

[[Cash crop]]s, especially tea, have now replaced the growing of opium poppies, and Santikhiri today is a tourist attraction known as Little Switzerland.<ref name="OneStop" />

==History==
The origins of the Santikhiri community go back to the end of the Chinese Civil War. In October 1949, after [[Mao Zedong]]'s communist party victory in China, the defeated Kuomintang (KMT) armies led by [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] retreated to [[Taiwan]], except for the 3rd and 5th [[Regiment]] of the 93rd Division, which refused to surrender.<ref name="Chua">{{cite news | title = China<U+2019>s forgotten soldiers | author = Chua Mui Yoon | date = 25 February 2007 | publisher = [[The Star (Malaysia)|StarMag (The Star Sunday supplement)]] | pages = SM4<U+2014>5 }}</ref> Fighting between the communist and KMT troops continued in some remote parts of China, including Yunnan in the southwest. When the Communists marched into the provincial capital of [[Kunming]] in January 1950, 12,000 troops from the 3rd and 5th Regiment, commanded respectively by Generals Lee Wen-huan (Li Wenhuan) and Tuan Shi-wen, fought their way out of Yunnan and escaped into Burma's jungles.<ref name="Jinakul"/> 

The soldiers' war did not end after their own "Long March" from Yunnan to M<U+00F6>ng Hsat in Burma's [[Shan State]]. The Burmese soon discovered that a foreign army was camped on their soil and launched an offensive against them. The fighting continued for 12 years, and several thousands of the KMT soldiers were eventually evacuated to Taiwan. When China entered the [[Korean War]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had a desperate need for intelligence on China. The agency turned to the two KMT generals, who agreed to slip some soldiers back into China for intelligence-gathering missions. In return, the agency offered arms to equip the generals to retake China from their bases in the Shan State. The KMT army tried on no less than seven occasions between 1950 and 1952 to invade Yunnan, but was repeatedly driven back into the Shan State.<ref name = "Lintner">{{cite web | last = Lintner | first = Bertil | url = http://www.asiapacificms.com/papers/pdf/gt_opium_trade.pdf | title = The Golden Triangle Opium Trade: An Overview | accessdate = 2007-11-07 | publisher = Asia Pacific Media Services }}</ref> The ending of the Korean War in 1953 was not the end of the KMT's fight against the communist Chinese and Burmese armies, which continued on for many years, supported by [[Washington]] and Taiwan and subsequently funded by the KMT's involvement in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]'s drug trade.<ref>{{cite news | last = Collins | first = Larry | title = The CIA drug connection is as old as the agency | date = 3 December 1993 | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | page = 5 }} </ref>

===Refuge in Thailand===
In 1961, Tuan led some {{formatnum:4000}} battle-weary KMT troops out of Burma to a mountainous sanctuary in Mae Salong in Thailand. In exchange for [[asylum]], the Thai government allowed them to stay on the understanding that they would assist in policing the area against communist infiltration.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gray | first = Denis | title = Anti-communist Chinese army in exile fading away | date = 12 May 2002 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] | page = 25 }}</ref>  As a result, most of the village's inhabitants today are ethnic [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and direct descendants of those KMT soldiers. At the same time, General Lee of the 3rd Regiment established his headquarters at Tham Ngob, northwest of [[Chiang Mai]].<ref name="BP-1998">{{cite news | title = The lost army | date = 15 November 1998 | publisher = [[Bangkok Post]] }} </ref> The KMT army was renamed Chinese Irregular Forces (CIF) and was placed directly under the control of a special task force, code-named "04", under the Supreme Command in [[Bangkok]].<ref name = "Lintner"/>
 
After the soldiers reached Mae Salong, China and Thailand struck an agreement to transfer the administration of the group to the Thai government. The [[province|Provincial]] [[governor]] of [[southern Thailand]], Pryath Samanmit, was reassigned as the governor of Chiang Rai, to oversee the KMT division, but upon taking up his position, Samanmit was killed by communist [[insurgents]]. Soon afterwards, the KMT division was ordered to assist the Thai government to counter the advancing armies on Thailand's northern borders and the internal threat from the [[Communist Party of Thailand]].<ref name="Chua 2">{{cite news | title = China<U+2019>s forgotten soldiers<U+2014>''Long March to Peace''  | author = Chua Mui Yoon | date = 25 February 2007 | publisher = [[The Star (Malaysia)|StarMag (The Star Sunday supplement)]] | page = SM5 }} </ref> Fierce battles were fought in the mountains of Doi Laung, Doi Yaw, Doi Phamon and Mae Aabb, and the communist uprising was successfully countered. The bloodiest operation was launched on 10 December 1970, a five-year long campaign that claimed over {{formatnum:1000}} lives, many from landmines. It was not until 1982 that the soldiers were able to give up their arms and were discharged to settle down to a normal life at Mae Salong. As a reward for their service, the Thai government gave citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families.<ref name="Chua 2"/>  

Despite the Thai government<U+2019>s attempts to integrate the KMT division and their families into the Thai nation, the inhabitants of Mae Salong preferred for many years to engage in the illegal opium trade, alongside the drug warlord [[Khun Sa]] of the Shan United Army.<ref name="Chua" /> In 1967, Tuan said in an interview with a British journalist:

In these mountains, the only money is opium.<ref> Endnote: Weekend Telegraph (London) dated 10 March 1967.</ref>|Gen Tuan Shi-wen|''Weekend Telegraph (London), 10 March 1967}} 

According to a CIA report in 1971, Mae Salong was then one of the largest [[heroin]] refineries in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Campbell | first = Colin | title = Thailand's Kuomintang Warlords Go Respectable  | date = 3 February 1983 | publisher = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Only in the late 1980s, after Khun Sa's army was finally routed and pushed over the border into Myanmar by the Thai military, was the Thai government able to make any headway in taming the region &ndash; part of which involved crop substitution plans and giving the area a new name. ''Santikhiri'' meaning "hill of peace" was introduced by the Thai government in an effort to disassociate the area from its former image as an established opium zone.<ref name="Thailand.com"/>  King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] and other members of the [[royal family|royal family]] made regular visits as a sign of their support for the old soldiers who had fought against their own country for Thailand.<ref name="Chua 2"/>

===Santikhiri today=== 
[[Image:Mae Salong.jpg|thumb|The hilltop village of Santikhiri on the mountain of Doi Mae Salong, circa 2005]]
As late as the mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was strictly off-limits to outsiders.<ref name="Jason">{{cite web | last = Gagliardi | first = Jason | url = http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,203585,00.html | title = Forever China in a Corner of Thailand | accessdate = 2007-07-01 | publisher = Time Magazine dated 18 Feb 2002 }}</ref> Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with its narrow winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri has become one of Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.passplanet.com/thailand/frame_where_go.htm | title = Thailand's Top 10 | accessdate = 2007-11-07 | publisher = Pass Planet }}</ref> The former soldiers had already settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local [[Thai people|Thais]]. The old soldiers and their descendants, carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, is the leader of the group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.<ref name="Chua"/> 

The crop substitution programs successfully encouraged the cultivation of tea, coffee, corn and fruit trees, replacing the opium poppies that had previously been grown. New fruit orchards and tea factories were also set up, followed by production facilities for fruit wines and [[Chinese herbs]], which are particularly popular amongst the Thai and Chinese tourists from Taiwan, [[Southeast Asia]]'s Chinese communities and China today.<ref name="Gray">{{cite news | last = Gray | first = Denis | title = Chinese nationalist veterans fade away as stronghold turns to tea and tourism  | date = 17 April 2002 | publisher = [[Associated Press]] }}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Santikhiri is a hilltop village in the [[Amphoe Mae Fa Luang|Mae Fa Luang district]] of Thailand's [[Chiang Rai Province]], about 80&nbsp;[[kilometres]] (50&nbsp;[[miles]]) from [[Chiang Rai]]. Santikhiri is on the highest peak of the Doi Mae Salong range of mountains, at an elevation of 1,800&nbsp;[[metres]] (5,904&nbsp;[[feet|ft]]) above sea level. It has an alpine-like climate, with crisp cool air all year round and chilly in the winter months of November through February. Santikhiri is accessible via two routes &ndash; Route 1130 from Ban Basang and Route 1234 from the south, which until being paved were only accessible by pack horses.<ref name="Thailand.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.thailand.com/travel/natural/natural_chiangrai_doi%20mae%20salong.htm | title = Natural Attractions <U+2014> Doi Mae Salong | accessdate = 2007-07-02 | publisher = Thailand.com }}</ref> Now regular minibus services, running from 6&nbsp;am to 4&nbsp;pm, are available from Chiang Rai to Santikhiri.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cummings | first = Joe | title = Thailand | publisher = [[Lonely Planet]] | date = 2005 | isbn = 1740596978 | page = pp. 350<U+2014>351 }}</ref> 
 
Santikhiri has long been the home of many hill tribes such as the [[Akha]], [[Yao people|Yao]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Hmong people|Hmong]] that originated from southern China and Myanmar. Each tribe has its own language, and follows [[animist]] customs and practices. Living among the native inhabitants are the ethnic Chinese, who form the majority of Santikhiri's estimated population of 20,000.<ref name="Jinakul">{{cite news | last = Jinakul | first = Surath | title = Perspective: 'Lost army' at home in the Mountains of Peace |date = 17 July 2005 | publisher = [[Bangkok Post]] | page = P1 }}</ref>

==Landmarks and attractions==
[[Image:Mae Salong signboard.jpg|right|thumb|Tea shops like this are commonly found in Santikhiri]]
[[Image:Mae salong KMT 01.jpg|right|thumb|The Martyr's Memorial Hall]]
Santikhiri is noted for its ''High Mountain Oolong,'' a high grade traditional [[Chinese tea]], which makes up about 80% of all tea production in Chiang Rai. The province produces about {{nowrap|{{convert|200|t|L/T S/T|lk=on}}}} of tea a year. The combination of climate and soil conditions at Santikhiri is ideal for growing high quality [[Oolong]]s ("black dragon" in Chinese). Such teas are cultivated at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 1,400&nbsp;metres (3,960&ndash;4,620 ft). In 2005, Santikhiri was selected by the Tourism and Sports Ministry as an OTOP ("[[One Tambon One Product]]") tourism village in recognition of its fine oolong tea.<ref name="Jinakul"/> The goals are to stimulate the grassroots economy, increase the number of tourists, and develop Thailand's products and services. Taiwanese experts work alongside local farmers in tea processing plants which produce top-quality tea for both the local and export markets. The number of tea plantations in the village has increased significantly since the mid-1990s, and includes Choke Chamroen Tea, Wang Put Tan and 101 Tea.<ref>{{cite news | last = Theparat | first = Chatrudee | title = Anyone for a brew? Little Switzerland has a lot to offer with its beautiful scenery and aromatic tea | date = 2 October 2006 | publisher = [[Bangkok Post]] | page = B8 }}</ref>

From 28 December to 2 January each year, Santikhiri hosts the annual cherry blossoms festival, which is organised by Mae Salong Nok Tambon Administration Organisation in association with Mae Fa Luang District. The festival celebrates the culture of the hill tribe people from the Chiang Rai area, and includes a handicraft sale, a light and sound show, a parade by the tribes people, and a beauty contest.<ref>{{cite news | title = Travel Guide: January trip bargains | date = 23 December 2004 | publisher = [[Bangkok Post]] | page = H8 }}</ref>

General Tuan Shi-wen died in 1980, and was buried in a pagoda-like tomb on a hill-top reached via a 300-metre (984&nbsp;ft) climb. From the top, there is a panoramic view of the village.<ref name="BP-1998"/> There is a also a memorial to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear the names of the dead, set on an altar in the main building. It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine. The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of the KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.<ref>{{cite news | last = Weeradet | first = Thanin | title = Distinctly Yunnan: Doi Mae Salong in Chiang Rai is tea country, the legacy of Chinese who found refuge in this distant dale | date = 14 December 2006 | publisher = [[Bangkok Post]] | page = H1 }}</ref>

Phra Boromathat Chedi is a [[stupa|chedi]] built on a hill near the village, in honour of the late Princess Mother, [[Srinagarindra]]. There is an excellent view of the Myanmar frontier from the top, an area that was off-limits when it was under the control of the warlord Khun Sa.<ref name="OneStop">{{cite web |url=http://www.1stopchiangmai.com/northern_thailand/mae_salong/ |title=Guide to Mae Salong | accessdate=2007-10-25 |publisher=One Stop Chiang Mai}}</ref>
