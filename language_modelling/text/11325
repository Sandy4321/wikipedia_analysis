==Geography==
[[File:Indian Ocean bathymetry srtm.png|thumb|[[Bathymetry|Bathymetric]] map of the Indian Ocean]]
The African, Indian, and Antarctic crustal [[plate tectonics|plates]] converge in the Indian Ocean at the [[Rodrigues Triple Point]]. Their junctures are marked by branches of the [[mid-oceanic ridge]] forming an inverted Y, with the stem running south from the edge of the [[continental shelf]] near [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The eastern, western, and southern basins thus formed are subdivided into smaller basins by ridges.

The ocean's continental shelves are narrow, averaging 200&nbsp;kilometres (125&nbsp;mi) in width. An exception is found off Australia's western coast, where the shelf width exceeds 1,000&nbsp;kilometres (600&nbsp;mi). The average depth of the ocean is {{Convert|3890|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Its deepest point is [[Diamantina Deep]] in [[Diamantina Trench]], at {{Convert|8047|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep; also sometimes considered is [[Sunda Trench]], at a depth of {{Convert|7258|-|7725|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/OCEAN_PLANET/HTML/oceanography_geography_Indian.html Indian Ocean Geography], excerpted from: The World Factbook 1994, Central Intelligence Agency</ref> North of [[50th parallel south|50<U+00B0> south latitude]], 86% of the main basin is covered by [[pelagic]] sediments, of which more than half is [[Globigerina|globigerina ooze]]. The remaining 14% is layered with [[terrigenous]] sediments. Glacial outwash dominates the extreme southern latitudes.

The major choke points include [[Bab el Mandeb]], [[Strait of Hormuz]], the [[Lombok Strait]], the [[Strait of Malacca]] and the [[Palk Strait]]. Seas include the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Andaman Sea]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], [[Great Australian Bight]], [[Laccadive Sea]], [[Gulf of Mannar]], [[Mozambique Channel]], [[Gulf of Oman]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Red Sea]] and other tributary water bodies. The Indian Ocean is artificially connected to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through the [[Suez Canal]], accessible via the Red Sea.

{{Main|Borders of the oceans#Indian Ocean}}

===Climate===
The climate north of the [[equator]] is affected by a [[monsoon]] climate. Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail. In the Arabian Sea the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent. In the southern hemisphere the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe. When the monsoon winds change, cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the Arabian Sea and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The Indian Ocean is the warmest ocean in the world.

===Hydrology===
Among the few large rivers flowing into the Indian Ocean are the [[Zambezi]], [[Shatt al-Arab]], [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Narmada]], [[Ganges River|Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Irrawaddy River]]. The ocean's [[Ocean current|currents]] are mainly controlled by the monsoon. Two large circular currents, one in the northern hemisphere flowing clockwise and one south of the equator moving anticlockwise, constitute the dominant flow pattern. During the winter monsoon, however, currents in the north are reversed.

Deep water circulation is controlled primarily by inflows from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Red Sea]], and Antarctic currents. North of [[20th parallel south|20<U+00B0> south latitude]] the minimum surface temperature is 22&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (72&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), exceeding 28&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (82 <U+00B0>F) to the east. Southward of [[40th parallel south|40<U+00B0> south latitude]], temperatures drop quickly.

Surface water [[salinity]] ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000, the highest occurring in the Arabian Sea and in a belt between southern Africa and south-western Australia. Pack ice and icebergs are found throughout the year south of about [[65th parallel south|65<U+00B0> south latitude]]. The average northern limit of icebergs is [[45th parallel south|45<U+00B0> south latitude]].

===Subsurface features===
As the youngest of the major oceans <ref>Stow, D. A. V. (2006) ''Oceans : an illustrated reference'' Chicago : University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-77664-6 <U+2013> page 127 for map of Indian Ocean and text</ref> it has active spreading ridges that are part of the worldwide system of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s:-
*[[Carlsberg Ridge]]
*[[Southwest Indian Ridge]]
*[[Southeast Indian Ridge]]
*[[Central Indian Ridge]]

The [[Ninety East Ridge]] runs north-south at meridian [[90th meridian east|90<U+00B0>E]], dissecting the Indian Ocean into eastern and western halves.

The [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]] is another submerged mountain range runs approximately north-south between [[Lakshadweep]], the [[Atolls of the Maldives]] and the [[Chagos Archipelago]].

The [[Kerguelen Plateau]] is a small submerged continent, of volcanic origin, in the southern Indian Ocean.

The [[Mascarene Plateau]] is 2000&nbsp;km long undersea plateau that lies east of [[Madagascar]].

The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[East Asia]] with [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of [[petroleum]] and petroleum products from the oil fields of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Indonesia]]. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[India]], and Western Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xo.html The World Factbook]. Cia.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref> Beach sands rich in heavy [[mineral]]s, and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]].

==Marine life==
The warmth of the Indian Ocean keeps [[plankton|phytoplankton]] production low, except along the northern fringe and in a few scattered spots elsewhere; life in the ocean is thus limited. [[Fishing]] is confined to subsistence levels, because its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for [[shrimp]] and [[tuna]].

Endangered marine species include the [[dugong]], [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s.

[[Plastic]] pollution threatens the eastern coast of [[Mozambique Channel]].

==History==
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|300px|The economically important [[Silk Road]] (red) and spice [[trade routes]] (blue) were blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in ca. 1453 with the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This spurred exploration, and a new sea route around Africa was found, triggering the [[Age of Discovery]].]]
The world's earliest civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]] (beginning with [[Sumer]]), [[ancient Egypt]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]] (beginning with the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]]), which began along the valleys of the [[Tigris]]-[[Euphrates]], [[Nile]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers respectively, all developed around the Indian Ocean. Civilizations soon arose in [[Iran|Persia]] (beginning with [[Elam]]) and later in [[Southeast Asia]] (beginning with [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]).

During [[Egypt]]'s first dynasty (c. 3000 BC), sailors were sent out onto its waters, journeying to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], thought to be part of present-day [[Somalia]]. Returning ships brought gold and myrrh. The earliest known maritime trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley (c. 2500 BC) was conducted along the Indian Ocean. [[Phoenicia]]ns of the late [[3rd millennium BC]] may have entered the area, but no settlements resulted.

The Indian Ocean is far calmer, and was thus opened to trade earlier than the Atlantic or [[Pacific]] Oceans. The powerful monsoons also meant ships could easily sail west early in the season, then wait a few months and return eastwards. This allowed [[Indonesia]]n peoples to cross the Indian Ocean to settle in [[Madagascar]].

In the 2nd or 1st century BC, [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] was the first [[Greece|Greek]] to cross the Indian Ocean. [[Hippalus]] is said to have discovered the direct route from [[Arabia]] to India around this time. During the 1st and 2nd centuries AD intensive [[Roman commerce|trade relations]] developed between [[Roman Egypt]] and the [[Tamil people|Tamil kingdoms]] of the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]] in [[South India|Southern India]]. Like the Indonesian peoples above, the western sailors used the monsoon to cross the ocean. The unknown author of the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' describes this route, as well as the commodities that were traded along various commercial ports on the coasts of the Horn of Africa and India circa 1 CE. Among these trading settlements were [[Mosylon]] and [[Opone]] on the Red Sea littoral.

From 1405 to 1433, Admiral [[Zheng He]] led large fleets of the [[Ming Dynasty]] on several [[treasure voyages]] through the Indian Ocean, ultimately reaching the coastal countries of [[East Africa]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Dreyer | first=Edward L. | title=Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405<U+2013>1433 | year=2007 | publisher=Pearson Longman | location=New York | isbn=9780321084439 | authorlink=Edward L.

[[Image:Dorsetshire&Cornwall.jpg|thumb|British heavy cruisers ''[[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|Dorsetshire]]'' and ''[[HMS Cornwall (56)|Cornwall]]'' under Japanese air attack and heavily damaged on April 5, 1942]]
In 1497, Portuguese navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and became the first European to sail to India and later the [[Far East]]. The European ships, armed with heavy cannon, quickly dominated trade. [[Portugal]] attempted to achieve pre-eminence by setting up forts at the important straits and ports. They dominated trade and discovery along the coasts of Africa, and Asia until the mid 17th century. Later the Portuguese were challenged by other European powers. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602<U+2013>1798) sought control of trade with the East across the Indian Ocean. [[France]] and Britain established trade companies for the area. [[Spain]] established a major trading operation in the [[Philippines]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Pacific]]. By 1815, Britain became the principal power in the Indian Ocean.

The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 revived European interest in the East, but no nation was successful in establishing trade dominance. Since World War II the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the area, to be replaced by India, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and the [[United States]]. The last two tried to establish hegemony{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} by negotiating for naval base sites. Developing countries bordering the ocean, however, seek to have it made a "zone of peace"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} so that they may use its shipping lanes freely. The United Kingdom and United States maintain a military base on [[Diego Garcia]] atoll in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

On 26 December 2004, the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean were hit by a [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The waves resulted in more than 226,000 deaths and over 1 million people were left homeless.

In the late 2000s, the ocean evolved into a hub of [[Piracy in Somalia|pirate]] activity. By 2013, attacks off the Horn region's coast had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols.<ref name="Wapstoas">{{cite news|last=Arnsdorf|first=Isaac|title=West Africa Pirates Seen Threatening Oil and Shipping|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-22/west-africa-pirates-seen-threatening-oil-and-shipping.html|accessdate=23 July 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=22 July 2013}}</ref>
