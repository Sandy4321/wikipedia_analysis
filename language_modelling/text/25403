'''SMS ''Bremen''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Bremen''"){{efn|name=SMS|}} was the [lead ship]] of the seven-vessel {{sclass|Bremen|cruiser|4}}, built by the [[Imperial German Navy]]. She was built by the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]], her namesake city. She was laid down in 1902, launched in July 1903, and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in May 1904. Armed with a main battery of ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns and two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, ''Bremen'' was capable of a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. 

''Bremen'' served on the East American Station for the majority of her career, including the ten years before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. She returned to German in 1914 before the start of the war. At the onset of hostilities, she was attached to the fleet in the Baltic tasked with containing the Russians. In August 1915, she participated in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]], but did not see significant action during the battle. Four months later, on 17 December, she struck two Russian [[naval mine]]s and sank, with the loss of 250 of her crew.

''Bremen'' was ordered under the contract name "L"{{efn|name=provisional names}} and was laid down at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen|the ship's namesake city]] in 1902 and launched on 9 July 1903, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 19 May 1904.<ref name=G1023>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 102<U+2013>103</ref> The ship was {{convert|111.1|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.3|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.53|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|3797|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load.<ref name=G102>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 102</ref> Her propulsion system consisted of two [[triple-expansion engine]]s, designed to give {{convert|10000|shp|lk=in}} for a top speed of {{convert|22|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Bremen'' carried up to {{convert|860|t|LT}} of coal, which gave her a range of {{convert|4270|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. She had a crew of 14 officers and 274&ndash;287 enlisted men.<ref name=G1023/>

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|12200|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es. They were submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]].<ref name=G103>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 103</ref> The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick shields.<ref name=G102/>

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Bremen 1907.jpg|thumb|''Bremen'' in 1907]]

After her commissioning, ''Bremen'' served on the East American station,<ref name=G103/><ref name=M6>Mueller, p. 6</ref> and she frequently visited the [[United States]]. In April 1907, she and the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Roon||2}} sailed to the United States to participate in a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the arrival of colonists in [[Chesapeake Bay]] on 26 April. In addition to the German delegation, the international fleet consisted of warships from Great Britain, Japan, Austria-Hungary, France, Italy, and several other nations.<ref>Schroeder, pp. 302<U+2013>303</ref> 

[[Wilhelm Canaris]], the future admiral and head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' during [[World War II]], served aboard the ship starting on 2 November 1907, his first assignment after graduating from the naval academy.<ref name=M6/> ''Bremen'' conducted a tour of South America in late 1908, beginning in September with a call on [[Buenos Aires]], followed by a stop in [[Rio de Janiero]] in Brazil. The tour lasted through February 1909, and included stops in [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]], [[Guatemala]], and the [[Dutch Antilles]]. In March, ''Bremen'' returned to the northern Atlantic and visited American ports for the next three months.<ref>Mueller, pp. 6&ndash;7</ref>

[[File:SMS Bremen LOC hec 01142a.jpg|thumb|left|''Bremen'' in the United States in 1912]]
In September&ndash;October 1909, ''Bremen'', joined the [[protected cruiser]]s {{SMS|Victoria Louise||2}} and {{SMS|Hertha||2}}, and the light cruiser {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}, which had traveled to the United States to represent Germany during the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]].<ref>Levine & Panetta, p. 51</ref><ref>Mueller, p. 7</ref> In early 1912, ''Bremen'' was assigned to a goodwill cruise to the United States, along with the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke||2}}, the only German [[capital ship]] to ever visit the US, and the light cruiser {{SMS|Stettin||2}}. On 11 May 1912 the ships left Kiel and arrived off [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], on 30 May.<ref name=S15>Staff, p. 15</ref> There, they met the US Atlantic Fleet and were greeted by then-President [[William Howard Taft]] aboard the presidential yacht {{USS|Mayflower|PY-1|6}}.<ref>Hadley & Sarty, p.66</ref> After touring the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] for two weeks, they returned to Kiel on 24 June.<ref name=S15/> 

''Bremen'' remained abroad until 1914, when she returned to Germany. After the outbreak of [[World War I]] in July 1914, she was assigned to the fleet in the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=G103/> While there, she participated in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. She was assigned to the second attack on the Gulf, which took place on 16 August. She and the cruiser {{SMS|Graudenz||2}}, {{SMS|Augsburg||2}}, and {{SMS|Pillau||2}} escorted the [[dreadnought]]s {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Posen||2}} while they attempted to force their way into the Gulf.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> The German flotilla penetrated the Russian defenses by 19 August and steamed into the Gulf, but withdrew shortly thereafter due to the threat of Allied [[submarine]]s and [[naval mine|mines]].<ref>Halpern, p. 198</ref> On 17 December 1915, she ran into a Russian minefield and struck a pair of mines off [[Ventspils|Windau]] and sank. The majority of her crew died in the sinking, with 250 men killed. The [[torpedo boat]] {{SMS|V191||2}} was sunk as well.<ref name=G103/><ref>Halpern, p. 205</ref>
