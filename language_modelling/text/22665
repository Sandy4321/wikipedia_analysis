'''The Scout Association''' is the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] recognised [[Scouting]] association in the [[United Kingdom]]. Scouting began in 1907 through the efforts of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]]. Due to the rapid growth of Scouting and a desire to remove control from the publisher of the Scouting magazine, The Scout Association was formed under its previous name, '''The Boy Scout Association''', in 1910 by the grant of a charter by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. The Boy Scout Association was re-named as The Scout Association in 1967.

The stated aim of The Scout Association is to "promote the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potential" and to create "responsible citizens".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scouts.org.uk/aboutus/mission.htm|title= Mission Statement|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= The Scout Association}}</ref> As of 2007, The Scout Association provides a Programme to help achieve this aim for young people from the age of 6 to 25.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/6to25/|title= The 6-25 Programme|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> The latest census shows that almost 360,000 people aged 6&ndash;25 are members of The Scout Association.<ref name="2006 census">{{cite web |url= http://www.scouts.org.uk/review/ScoutingGrowing.html|title= Scouting is growing and getting stronger|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= The Scout Association}}</ref>

Girls were first admitted in 1976 to the [[Venture Scouts]], and the rest of Sections on an optional basis in 1991.  Since 2007 all Scout Groups in the UK must accept girls as well as boys, although religious preferences can be accommodated.<ref name="por_gp_coed">{{cite web | title = Rule 3.6: Mixed Membership | work = Policy, Organisation and Rules | publisher = The Scout Association | date = 2005 | url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/3_6.htm | format = html | accessdate =  2007-02-14}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Birth of the Movement ===

The roots of The Scout Association come from the fame of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] following his exploits during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. In [[1907]], "B-P", as he is known to all members of the Movement, ran a [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp on Brownsea Island]] for teenage boys of varying backgrounds in 1907. This camp is now considered to be the start of the Movement.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://eng.brownsea2007.org/|title= Brownsea Island|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= Brownsea Island}}</ref>

The following year, Baden-Powell wrote a series of magazines, ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'', setting out activities and programmes which existing youth organisations could make use of.<ref name="A Scouting timeline">{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/|title= The History of Scouting|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> The reaction was phenomenal, and quite unexpected. In very short time, Scout Patrols were created up and down the country, all following the principles of Baden-Powell's book. By the time of the first census in 1910, there were over 100,000 members of the Movement.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/>

The Boy Scout Association was created in [[1910]] in order to provide a national body which could organise and support the rapidly growing number of Scout Patrols. It was also the wish of Baden-Powell to wrest control of Scouting from his book's publishers as it was felt the Movement was not given the status it deserved as the publishers controlled membership of Scouting.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/>

===1910&ndash;1920: Growth===

[[Image:PreAPR.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Membership badge of The Scout Association prior to 1967]]
Almost immediately, The Boy Scout Association was presented with a dilemma. Many of the boys in the Scout Patrols (at the start, Scouting was for boys between the ages of 10 and 19) had younger brothers who also wanted to participate. There were also many girls who wanted the same thing as well &ndash; Baden-Powell came across a group of Girl Scouts at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Rally in 1910.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> The solution for the younger boys was simple &ndash; the [[Cub Section (UK)|Wolf Cubs]] Section was created in [[1917]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/cubs.htm|title= Cub Scouts|accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher= Scouting Milestones}}</ref> However, [[Edwardian]] principles could not allow young girls to participate in the rough and tumble, and "wild" activities of the Scouts, and so the [[Girlguiding UK|Girl Guides]] were created by Baden-Powell's sister, [[Agnes Baden-Powell|Agnes]], to provide a more "proper" programme of activities.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> Many of those who had grown out of Scouts still wanted to be a part of Scouting, so another section was created in [[1918]] &ndash; the [[Rover Scouts]].<ref name="Rover Scouts">{{cite web |url= http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/rovers.htm|title= Rover Scouts|accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher= Scouting Milestones}}</ref>

Scouting was now a global phenomenon, with a [[Royal Charter]] of [[January 4]], [[1912]] incorporating The Boy Scout Association throughout the [[British Empire]], with "the purpose of instructing boys of all classes in the principles of discipline loyalty and good citizenship", being granted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://scoutdocs.ca/Scouts_Canada_Act_/Royal_Charter.php|title= Royal Charter of The Boy Scouts Association|accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher= Scoutdocs}}</ref> The first World Jamboree for Scouts was held in [[Olympia, London|Olympia]], [[London]] in [[1920]], and was a celebration and conference of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/>
[[Image:The Scout Association logo 1967-2003.png|thumb|right|The Logo between 1967 and 2003]]

===1967&ndash;2003===
Scouting in the UK went largely unchanged until it underwent a major review and change in 1967. The name of the organisation was changed to be The Scout Association.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> Major changes to the sections and their respective programmes were made &ndash; the youngest section were now named [[Cub Section (UK)|Cub Scouts]],<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> the Boy Scout section was re-named simply as the Scout section, Senior Scouts became [[Venture Scouts]]<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> (for 16&ndash;20 year olds) and the Rover Scout section was disbanded.<ref name="Rover Scouts"/> The Scout Uniform was also changed &ndash; most notably with the inclusion of long trousers for the Scouts (previously they had been wearing knee-length shorts).<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/>

Several developments were made over the following years, including the introduction of [[co-educational]] units of boys and girls, initially restricted to the Venture Scouts section in [[1976]], but from [[1991]] junior sections were allowed to become mixed as well.<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/> Parents involved in Scouting in [[Northern Ireland]] also began to organise activities for their children who were too young for Cub Scouts. This eventually led to the creation of the [[Beaver Scouts|Beaver Scout]] section, officially starting in [[1986]].<ref name="A Scouting timeline"/>

Despite these changes, and many other minor ones, Scouting started to fall into a decline through the [[1990s]] with falling membership levels.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.netpages.free-online.co.uk/sha/crisis.htm|title= The growing crisis in the Scout movement|accessdate=2007-08-17 |publisher= Scout History Association}}</ref> This spurred a major review into the causes of the decline,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/headline/991227aa.htm|title= UK Scouting plans its future|accessdate=2007-08-17 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> followed by a programme change which took effect in [[2003]].<ref name="New activity programme">{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/headline/020222aa.htm|title= New activity programme for UK Scouts|accessdate=2007-08-17 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref>

[[Image:The Scout Association logo.png|thumb|left|120px|The Logo since 2003]]

===2003&ndash;present===
Scouting found itself competing for young people's time against longer school days and other extra-curricular activities. There are also concerns from the adult leadership with regards to the growing [[litigation]] culture in the UK.<ref name="Gameboy generation">{{cite web |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/15/nscout115.xml|title= The Gameboy generation returns to the Scouts|accessdate=2007-08-20 |publisher= [[Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>
Scouting has also been challenged by a negative [[stereotype]] as being [[old fashioned]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.saga.co.uk/magazine/people/reallives/ScoutsToday.asp|title= The Scout movement today|accessdate=2007-08-17 |publisher= Saga}}</ref>

The programme change in [[2003]] sought to overcome the growing challenges facing the Movement and saw changes at all levels of UK Scouting &ndash; the most apparent being the suspension of Venture Scouts. To replace this senior section, The Scout Association created the [[Explorer Scouts]] for 14&ndash;18 year old members, and the [[Scout Network]] for 18&ndash;25 year olds.<ref name="New activity programme"/> The Scout Association also introduced a number of new badges, such as computing skills and [[skateboarding]], to modernise the image of Scouting. These new badges drew mixed reactions from several public figures, with some praising The Scout Association for "moving with the times" and others feeling the changes went "against the Scouting ethos of Baden-Powell".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/07/09/nscout09.xml|title=  Computing, faith and even PR, the Scout badges leading the pack|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= [[Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>
[[Image:Snj_exp_stanage.jpg|right|thumb|[[Explorer Scouts]] climbing at [[Stanage Edge]]]]


Other changes in 2003 included changes to the leadership training so that it is more flexible, allowing for specific roles in the Movement, rather than the general leadership training which preceded it. New Scout uniforms for all sections and leaders were also introduced in 2003, with the aim of being more modern and appealing to young people.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/headline/010222ab.htm|title= New Scout Uniform|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref>

There have been many critics of these changes, mostly citing problems with the implementation, although recent census figures show a general upturn in membership.<ref name="Gameboy generation"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scouts.org.uk/review/GrowingMembership.html|title= A growing membership|accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher= The Scout Association}}</ref> Scouting in the UK continues to promote the same ''Principles and Methods'' as written by Baden-Powell in ''Scouting for Boys'' almost 100 years ago.

The UK played a major role in the [[Scouting 2007 Centenary|centenary celebrations of Scouting]] in 2007, with celebration events organised on [[Brownsea Island]],<ref>{{cite news

== Organisation ==
[[Image:Ensign of The Scout Association.png|thumb|Ensign of The Scout Association]]
The [[Chief Scout]] is the leader of The Scout Association, and is responsible for determining the direction and policies of Scouting in the United Kingdom and Overseas Territories. [[Peter Duncan (actor)|Peter Duncan]] is the current Chief Scout.<ref>{{cite news
| title = Scouts honour for Blue Peter man

| publisher = [[BBC News]]
| date = 2004-07-19
| accessdate = 2007-08-15}}</ref> There is a team of Commissioners who are responsible for the Scouting programme in their respective divisions. These currently are:

* David Bull, International Commissioner
* John Asplin, Chief Commissioner of England
* Tim Kidd, UK Commissioner for Adult Support
* Andrew Welbeloved, UK Commissioner for Programme

At all levels, Scouts are governed by an executive of non-Scouting [[trustees]], known as executive committees<ref name="Charity Trustee">{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs500009.pdf|title= Charity Trustee|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> &ndash; these could be volunteers from the local community who have had ties with Scouting, either themselves or through their children. The executive normally consists of a chairman, secretary, treasurer, and a number of other officers. In Group Executive Committees, Group Scout Leaders and Section Leaders also form part of the committee.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs330077.pdf|title= The Group Executive Committee|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> Their role is to ensure that the best interests of the young people and the community are served by the Group, District, County, or National organisations.<ref name="Charity Trustee"/>

Senior volunteers in The Scout Association are called 'Commissioners'. Every County/Area<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs330075.pdf|title= Role description for a Area Commissioner|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs330074.pdf|title= Role description for a County Commissioner|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> and District<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs330076.pdf|title= Role description for a District Commissioner|accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> is headed by a Commissioner who is responsible for ensuring the Districts/Groups under their jurisdiction meet the standards set by The Scout Association. They receive support from Field Development Officers in England, who are employed by the Field Development Service and deployed locally to help support The Scout Association's objectives.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/2_10.htm|title= Development Policy|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> Commissioners in the other regions receive support from Field Commissioners, employed and directed differently. District Commissioners report to the County/Area Commissioner, who in turn report to the Chief Commissioner.

===Structure===
{{dablink|For more details on this topic, see [[Scout Counties]], [[Scout District]] and [[Scout Group]].}}
The Scout Association is divided into four mainland national groupings: [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Each of these divisions are further broken up into local Counties (England and Northern Ireland) or Areas (Wales and Scotland),<ref name="How we operate">{{cite web |url= http://www.scouts.org.uk/aboutus/Structure.htm|title= How we operate|accessdate=2007-08-15 |publisher= The Scout Association}}</ref> which generally follow the boundaries of the [[ceremonial counties]] of Great Britain. The County/Area consists of a number of Scout Districts, which are made up of Groups.<ref name="How we operate"/>
[[Image:ScoutMarch CopyrightKaihsuTai.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A Scout parade in Oxford, 2004]]

The Groups are the local organisations for Scouting, and are the direct descendants of the original Scout Patrols. Groups can consist of one or more Beaver Colonies, Cub Packs and Scout Troops. Groups may also have one or more Group Scout Fellowships, and have an Explorer Scout Unit attached to it, though Explorer Scouts are controlled at the District level.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/chapter_3.htm#part_1|title= The Scout Group: Introduction|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref>  Scout Groups are led by a Group Scout Leader whose main role is handling communication between the local District and the Section Leaders and ensuring the Scout Group meets the minimum standard required by The Scout Association.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/3_43.htm#rule_3.42|title= The Scout Group: Responsibilities of Appointments in the Scout Group|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref>

=== Sections ===
The three youngest sections are controlled by a Section Leader, who must hold a warrant for the position, who is aided by at least two assistant leaders, one of whom should also hold a warrant.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/3_7.htm#rule_3.7|title= The Scout Group: The Beaver Scout Colony|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/3_8.htm#rule_3.8|title= The Scout Group: The Cub Scout Pack|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/por/2006/3_9.htm#rule_3.9|title= The Scout Group: The Scout Troop|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= ScoutBase}}</ref> Other adults who help run a Scout section may be volunteers (such as parents of children in the Group), [[Explorer Scouts#Young Leaders|Young Leaders]] (Explorer Scouts that have been trained to assist other leaders) and members of the Group Executive Committee who help operate the Group financially. Explorer Scouts and the Scout Network are controlled differently as they are not part of the Scout Groups.

===Group branches===
Some Scout Groups belong to separate branches called [[Air Scouts#United Kingdom|Air Scouts]] and [[Sea Scout (UK)|Sea Scouts]]. Both branches follow the core programme in all Sections but can add more aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the branch, with some Group branches being recognised by the [[Royal Air Force]] or [[Royal Navy]].

In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% are Royal Navy recognised,<ref name="scout_afloat">{{cite web | title = Scouting Afloat | work = | publisher = The Scout Association | date = Nov 2004| url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/hqdocs/facts/pdfs/fs295108.pdf | format = pdf 96kb | accessdate =  2007-08-16}}</ref> whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF.<ref>{{cite web | title = Air Scout Groups and Units| work = | publisher = The Scout Association | date = | url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/6to25/scout/airscout/airlist.htm | format =  | accessdate =  2007-08-16}}</ref>

===Scout Activity Centres===
{{main|Scout Activity Centre}}
Most Scout campsites are run by their Scout Districts and Counties, however there are four which have been made Scout Activity Centres, by The Scout Association. These are the main campsites in the UK and receive extra support from The Scout Association. The Scout Activity Centres are [[Baden-Powell House]], [[Downe Scout Activity Centre]], [[Gilwell Park]] and [[Youlbury Scout Activity Centre]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.scouts.org.uk/nationalcentres/|title= Scout Activity Centres|accessdate=2007-08-18 |publisher= The Scout Association}}</ref>
