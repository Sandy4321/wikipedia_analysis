The '''Burt County Missouri River Bridge''' is a [[truss bridge]] over the [[Missouri River]] connecting [[Burt County, Nebraska]] and [[Monona County, Iowa]] at [[Decatur, Nebraska]].  It is one of three [[toll bridge]]s in Nebraska.

The bridge connects [[Nebraska Highway 51]] and [[Iowa Highway 175]]. [[Interstate 29]] is 7 miles east and [[Onawa, Iowa]] 8 miles east of the Missouri River. 

The bridge was finished in 1951 and carried the first traffic in 1955 after the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] diverted the river to flow under the bridge.
