'''HMS ''Enterprise'' (D52)''' was one of two [[Emerald class cruiser|''Emerald''-class]] [[light cruiser]]s of the [[Royal Navy]].  She was built by [[John Brown & Company|John Brown Shipbuilding & Engineering Company Ltd.]], with the keel being laid down on 28 June 1918.  She was launched on 23 December 1919, and commissioned 7 April 1926.  She was the 14th ship to serve with the Royal Navy to carry the name ''Enterprise'', a name which is still used in the Royal Navy today.

In the early 1930s Enterprise was fitted with a prototype twin 6" turret in place of her two forward single mounts; this was the turret later installed in the Leander, Amphion and Arethusa Classes. The turret installation occupied less space than the superimposed 'A' and 'B' guns of Emerald, therefore the bridge was placed further forward. The bridge was of a new design, being a single block topped by a director tower, rather than the traditional platforms built around the foremast and wheelhouse topped with a spotting top. This design of bridge would appear in the County class cruisers.

==History==
===Pre-war===
After several months in home waters, ''Enterprise'' served with the [[British 4th Cruiser Squadron]] in the [[East Indies]] her first commission ending in December 1928. She undertook several subsequent commissions on the [[East Indies Station]], until she returned home and was reduced to care and maintenance on 4 July 1934, followed by a major refit. She returned to the East Indies in January 1936, but was relieved by [[HMS Manchester (C15)|HMS ''Manchester'']] at the end of 1937 and came home. In 1938 she was employed to take crews to the [[China Station]], returning home to pay off on 30 September and she was reduced to the reserve fleet.

====First commission====
Her first commission was remarkable mostly for its culmination and the events that took place between 19 September and 10 December 1928. She was ordered home via Mauritius and the main ports of East Africa; her first cruise into the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. She pulled into [[Kilindini Harbour]] ten days before the arrival of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] and his younger brother the [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]] on the SS ''Malda'' who had arrived in East Africa to undertake a semi-official visit to [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanganyika]] and to participate in some [[Trophy hunting|big-game hunting]]. A launch from ''Enterprise'' ferried the royal party ashore and over the next 36 hours the senior officers were invited to participate in various functions before the departure of the two princes for [[Nairobi]] the next evening on the overnight train.

The [[Rugby Union|rugby]] team from HMS ''Enterprise'', composed of 30 officers and men, then departed for a two week tour of Kenya and Uganda playing [[Nakuru RFC]], [[Kitale]] RFC, [[Kampala]] RFC, a combined [[Kericho]]/[[Londiani]] XV, a combined [[Thika]]/[[Ruiru]] XV, and the [[Mombasa Sports Club]]. In addition several members of this body of men participated in a boxing tournament (Royal Navy versus Kenya) in Nairobi towards the end of the tour. HMS ''Enterprise'' left Mombasa and sailed to [[Zanzibar]], [[Dar es Salaam]] and [[Tanga]], playing a total of four more matches in these three ports, thus completing the first rugby tour of all three East African nations by a Royal Naval vessel.  She turned north and steamed for home via [[Aden]] and [[Port Suez]].

Two hours out of Aden, however, she received orders to return to pick up the Prince of Wales from Dar es Salaam and carry him to [[Brindisi]] with all possible speed. His father, the then king [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], was seriously ill. The Prince came aboard on 2 December and ''Enterprise'' made a record passage of the 4087 miles to Brindisi in eight days.  The Prince travelled onward to [[Bolougne]] by a special train provided by the Italian government and arrived at [[Buckingham Palace]] only nine days after leaving Dar es Salaam.

As this voyage was taking place, a parcel arrived at the headquarters of the Rugby Football Union of Kenya,{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} containing a silver goblet.  The officers and men of the Enterprise had gifted this trophy to be awarded annually to the winners of an Inter-District championship; the [[Enterprise Cup]]. This cup has become central to rugby competition in East Africa and has been played for every year since with the exception of the [[World War II|war]] years (1940<U+2013>1946) and 1987 when an international rugby competition was held on the [[RFUEA Ground]] as part of the [[All Africa Games]].

===Second World War===
====Initial stages====
At the start of [[World War II|the Second World War]], in October 1939, she was recommissioned and joined Atlantic patrols with the 4th Cruiser Squadron.  She later joined the [[North America and West Indies Squadron]].  ''Enterprise'' was employed on Atlantic escort duties with the [[Halifax Escort Force]] during 1939 and 1940.  In October 1939, she oversaw the transfer of <U+20A4>10 million in [[Gold as an investment|gold bullion]] to Canada.

In April 1940, she was transferred to the [[British Home Fleet|Home Fleet]] for the [[Norwegian Campaign]].  During April and May she supported the British Army ashore by bombardments in and around [[Narvik]], [[Norway]] and, on 19 April, was attacked unsuccessfully by [[German submarine U-65 (1940)|''U-65'']].  After some repairs ''Enterprise'' joined the newly formed [[Force H]] in June 1940 and set sail for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] where, in July, she participated in negotiations with the [[French Navy]] regarding the future of the French fleet in the war.  Following the unsatisfactory outcome of the negotiations, she participated in [[Attack on Mers-el-K<U+00E9>bir|Operation Catapult]] at [[Mers El K<U+00E9>bir|Mers-El-K<U+00E9>bir]], sinking many French warships.  She also participated in the delivery of aircraft to [[Siege_of_Malta_(World_War_II)#First_phase.2C_1940-41|Malta in late July]].

====Outside Home Waters====
Force H was then re-organised and ''Enterprise'' was sent to [[Cape Town]] after which she became the flagship for operations in [[South America]], primarily involved in trade defence and interception duties.  In December 1940, she was deployed with HMS [[HMS Cumberland (57)|''Cumberland'']] and [[HMS Newcastle (C76)|''Newcastle'']] in an unsuccessful search for the [[German auxiliary cruiser Thor|''Thor'']] which had attacked and defeated HMS ''Caernarvon Castle''.

In early 1941, she was redeployed to the [[Indian Ocean]] where, accompanied by a sizeable fleet of Royal Navy and [[Royal Australian Navy]] ships lead by [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']], participated in a search for the [[Kriegsmarine|German ship]] [[German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]].  After the search was abandoned, she took up convoy escort duty before being sent to [[Basra]] after a pro-German revolt by [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] started the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]].  The war was won by the end of May, after which ''Enterprise'' was released back into convoy escort duty in the Indian Ocean.

[[Image:HMScornwall2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|HMS ''Cornwall'' sinking after a Japanese attack, HMS ''Enterprise'' rescued some of her crew.]]
In November, she was under refit and repair in [[Colombo]], which was finished just in time for the start of the [[Pacific War|War with Japan]] in December 1941.  She escorted troop ships to [[Singapore]] and [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]], and then joined the [[British Eastern Fleet|Eastern Fleet]] under [[James Somerville (admiral)|Admiral Sir James Somerville]], taking part in protection of trade for the next year.  On 6 April 1942, together with [[HMS Paladin (G69)|HMS ''Paladin'']] and [[HMS Panther (G41)|HMS ''Panther'']], she picked up some the 1,120 survivors of the cruisers [[HMS Cornwall (56)|HMS ''Cornwall'']] and [[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|HMS ''Dorsetshire'']], which had been sunk by the Japanese in their [[Easter Sunday Raid]].  The Easter Sunday Raid was part of the larger Japanese [[Indian Ocean raid]], which threatened [[British Ceylon]].  HMS ''Enterprise'' participated in yet another fruitless search for enemy ships during this period, when it was believed the Japanese were preparing to strike and possibly invade the Indian Ocean island.

====Home Waters====
On 25 December 1942, she returned to [[River Clyde|Clyde]] for extensive refit and modernisation works, which were only completed in October 1943.  Trials and tests continued throughout November.

In late December 1943, she was deployed with [[HMS Gambia (48)|HMNZS ''Gambia'']] and [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] for [[Operation Stonewall]].  On 28 December, she engaged a force of eleven German [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo boat]]s, the tardy escort for their [[blockade runner]] ''Alsterufer'' (which had been sunk the previous day by air attack).  HMS ''Enterprise'' sank the torpedo boat ''T26'' with a torpedo, while ''T25'' and ''Z27'' were also sunk.  Four other German ships were damaged in the engagement.

From 3 February to 29 February 1944 ''Enterprise'' was docked at Devonport for refit, and from 27 March to 31 March she was fitted for missile jamming gear at Devonport.

====The Invasion of Normandy====
In May, HMS ''Enterprise'' was then assigned to Bombardment Force "A" serving with [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|USS ''Nevada'']], [[HMS Hawkins (D86)|HMS ''Hawkins'']], [[HMS Black Prince (81)|HMS ''Black Prince'']], [[HMS Erebus (I02)|HMS ''Erebus'']], [[USS Tuscaloosa (CA-37)|USS ''Tuscaloosa'']], [[Flores class sloops|HNLMS ''Soemba'']] and [[USS Quincy (CA-71)|USS ''Quincy'']].  Her sub-group was Assault Force "U" (for [[Utah Beach]]), of which she was the lead ship.

[[Image:HMS Mauritius firing.jpg|thumb|right|[[HMS Mauritius (80)|HMS ''Mauritius'']] bombards enemy positions on the French coast.]]
When the [[Normandy Landings]] started on 6 June 1944, Bombardment Force "A" bombarded St. Martin de Vassville. ''Enterprise'' engaged the coastal defences of [[Cherbourg]]; in the ensuing action her Captain and her Commander were both wounded, and the ship was brought back to Portland by the First Lieutenant, Lt. Cdr. Brown. Twenty days later, she was also involved in the bombardment of [[Querqueville]], silencing the German guns there.  German shore batteries opened fire, but caused no significant damage to ''Enterprise''. During the D-day operations ''Enterprise'' fired about 9,000 6-in. shells and required two overnight gun changes at Portsmouth.<ref>''Warship International'', No. 1, 1997, p. 7.</ref>

In July, she was deployed off the French coast in support of British operations, and on 17 July, she provided naval gunfire for two days in support for British attacks near [[Caen]] with [[HMS Mauritius (80)|HMS ''Mauritius'']] and [[HMS Roberts (F40)|HMS ''Roberts'']].  In September, she was deployed in a similar capacity off the Dutch coast in support of the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], however, she was not required to support the troops.

In October, after a considered transferral to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] was not implemented, ''Enterprise'' was taken out of active service and placed in reserve at [[Rosyth]].

===Post-war===
Starting in May, HMS ''Enterprise'' helped return British troops from Asia and Africa.  On 13 January 1946, she returned to the [[United Kingdom]] for the final time.  She was handed over to [[British Steel|BISCO]] for scrapping on 11 April 1946, arriving at JH Cashmore in [[Newport]], [[Wales]], on 21 April 1946 for breaking-up.

==Armament Refits==
Throughout her service, HMS ''Enterprise'' was refitted with a slightly differing array of weaponry.  Below is a table of the new armament after her first refit:

* [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]] (1940)
* [[Operation Stonewall|Biscay]] (1943)
* [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy]] (1944)

In addition, the ship inherited a battle honour from the [[fourth-rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Enterprize (1718)|HMS ''Enterprize'']], which fought against [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] in the [[Seven Years War]]:
* [[British expedition against Cuba|Havana]] (1762)

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} The RFU-K was dissolved in 1953 with the formation of the [[Rugby Football Union of East Africa]] (RFUEA); the current [[Kenya Rugby Football Union]] (KRFU) was not formed until 1970.
