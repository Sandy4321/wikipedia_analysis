"'''Chimes of Freedom'''" is a song written and performed by [[Bob Dylan]] and featured on his 1964 album ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' (see [[1964 in music]]), [[Record producer|produced]] by [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]].  It was written in early 1964 and was influenced by the [[symbolist]] poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]].  The song depicts the feelings and thoughts of the singer and his companion as they wait out a [[thunderstorm|lightning storm]] under a doorway.  The singer expresses his solidarity with people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, and believes that the thunder is tolling in sympathy for them.  Music critic [[Paul Williams]] has described the song as Dylan's [[Sermon on the Mount]].  The song has been covered many times by different artists, including [[The Byrds]], [[Jefferson Starship]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[U2]].  

==Bob Dylan's version==
"Chimes of Freedom" was written shortly after the release of the "[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]" album in early 1964 during a [[road trip]] that Dylan took across America with musician [[Paul Clayton (folksinger)|Paul Clayton]], journalist Pete Karman, and [[road manager]] Victor Maimudes.<ref name="williams">{{cite book|author=Williams, P.|year=1990|title=Bob Dylan Performing Artist: Book One 1960 -1973|publisher=Xanadu Publications Ltd.|isbn= 1-85480-044-2}}</ref>  It was written at about the same time as "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]", which is similarly influenced by the symbolism of [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref name=heylin/>  There are conflicting stories about exactly when during the trip this song was written.  One story is that Dylan wrote the song on a portable typewriter in the back of a car the day after visiting [[civil rights activist]]s [[Bernice Johnson Reagon|Bernice Johnson]] and [[Cordell Reagon]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name=heylin>{{cite book|title=Revolution in the Air|author=Heylin, C.|pages=176<U+2013>181|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-843-9}}</ref><ref name=rough/><ref name=keys/>  However, a handwritten lyric sheet from the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Toronto, Canada that was reproduced in ''The Bob Dylan Scrapbook 1956-1966'' indicates that this story cannot be entirely true.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=scrap>{{cite book|title=The Bob Dylan Scrapbook 1956-1966|author=Santelli, R.|pages=34<U+2013>35|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7432-2828-2}}</ref>  Dylan was in [[Toronto, Canada]] in late January and early February, before the road trip on which the song was supposedly written.<ref name=heylin/>  So, although parts of the song may have been written on the road trip, Dylan had started working on the song earlier.<ref name=heylin/>  The first public performance of the song took place in early 1964, either at the Civic Auditorium in Denver on February 15,<ref name=heylin/> or at the Berkley Community Theater in San Francisco on February 22.<ref>{{cite book|author=Heylin, C.|year=1991|title=Dylan: Behind The Shades <U+2013> The Biography|publisher=Viking Penguin|isbn=0-670-83602-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Dylan Berkeley Community Theater concert poster|publisher=Vintage Concert Posters|url=http://vintageconcertposters.com/_main/Index.cfm?page=api/gallery/photo.cfm&id=220&gid=14|accessdate=2009-10-15}}</ref>  "Chimes of Freedom" was an important part of Dylan's [[Concert|live concert]] repertoire throughout most of 1964, although by the latter part of that year he had ceased performing it and would not perform it again until 1987, when he revived the song for concerts with the [[Grateful Dead]] and with [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]].<ref name=heylin/><ref name=keys>{{cite book|title=Keys to the Rain|author=Trager, O.|pages=104<U+2013>105|year=2004|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7974-0}}</ref>  

The master [[take]] of the song was recorded by Dylan, with Tom Wilson producing, during the [[Studio recording|recording sessions]] for the ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' album on June 9, 1964.<ref name=heylin/>  It took seven takes before Dylan got the song right, even though it was one of only three songs that he recorded during the session that he had already performed in front of a concert audience.<ref name=heylin/> 

Music critic [[Paul Williams]] has described the song as Dylan's [[Sermon on the Mount]].<ref name=rough/>  The song is a lyrical expression of feelings evoked while watching a [[Thunderstorm|lightning storm]].<ref name="williams"/>  The singer and a companion are caught in a thunderstorm in mid-evening and the pair of them duck into a doorway, where they are both transfixed by one lightning flash after another.<ref name="williams"/>  The natural phenomena of thunder and lightning appear to take on auditory and ultimately emotional aspects to the singer, with the thunder experienced as the tolling of bells and the lightning bolts appearing as chimes.<ref name="williams"/>  Eventually, the sights and sounds in the sky become intermixed in the mind of the singer, as evidenced by the lines:
:''As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds,
:''Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dylan, B.|page=198|year=1988|title=Lyrics: 1962-1985|publisher=Paladin|isbn=0-586-08647-1}}</ref>
Over the course of the song the sun slowly rises and the lyrics can be interpreted as a proclamation of the hope that as the sky clears after a difficult night, all the world's people will rise together to proclaim their survival to the sound of the church bells.<ref name=keys/>

In ''[[Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art]]'', author Mike Marqusee notes that the song marks a transition between Dylan's earlier [[protest song]] style (a litany of the down-trodden and oppressed, in the second half of each verse) and his later  more free-flowing poetic style (the fusion of images of lightning, storm and bells in the first half).<ref>Marqusee, M. (2003). ''Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art.'' The New Press. [http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&task=view_title&metaproductid=1030 ISBN 1-85480-044-2]</ref>  In this later style, which is influenced by 19th century French [[symbolist]] poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], the poetry is more allusive, filled with "chains of flashing images."<ref name=gill>{{cite book|title=Don't Think Twice, It's All Right|author=Gill, A.|page=58|year=1998|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1 56025 185 9}}</ref>  In this song, rather than support a specific cause as in his earlier protest songs, he finds solidarity with all people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, including unwed mothers, the disabled, refugees, outcasts, those unfairly jailed, "the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked," and, in the final  verse, "the countless confused, accused, misused, strung out ones and worse" and "every hung-up person in the whole wide universe."<ref name=rough/><ref name=gill/>  By having the chimes of freedom toll for both rebels and rakes, the song is more inclusive in its sympathies than previous protest songs, such as "[[The Times They Are A-Changin']]", written just the prior year.<ref name=gill/><ref name=tougher>{{cite book|title=Tougher Than the Rest: 100 Best Bruce Springsteen Songs|author=Sawyers, J.S.|year=2006|page=193|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-8256-3470-3}}</ref>  After "Chimes of Freedom", Dylan's protest songs no longer depicted social reality in the black and white terms he renounces in "[[My Back Pages]]" but rather use [[satire|satirical]] [[surrealism]] to make their points.<ref name=gill/> 

The assassination of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], [[John F. Kennedy]], is one possible inspiration for Dylan starting the song.<ref name=heylin/>  Although Dylan has denied that this is the case, he did draft a number of poems in the fall of 1963 in the aftermath of Kennedy's death and one of those poems in particular, a short six line piece, appears to contain the genesis for "Chimes of Freedom":<ref name=heylin/>

:''the colors of friday were dull
:''as the cathedral bells were gently burnin'
:''strikin for the gentle
:''strikin for the kind
:''strikin for the crippled ones
:''and strikin for the blind.

Kennedy was killed on a Friday, and the cathedral bells in the poem would have been the church bells heralding his death.<ref name=heylin/>  Using a storm as a metaphor for the death of a president is similar to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] use of a storm in ''[[King Lear]]''.<ref name=heylin/>  By the time Dylan wrote the first draft of "Chimes of Freedom" the following February, it contained many of the elements of this poem, except that the crippled ones and the blind were changed to "guardians and protectors of the mind."<ref name=heylin/>  In addition, the cathedral bells had become the "chimes of freedom flashing", as seen by two lovers finding shleter in a cathedral doorway.<ref name=heylin/>

Besides Rimbaud's sybolism, the song is also influenced by the [[alliterative]] poetry of [[Gerald Manley Hopkins]], the poetic vision of [[William Blake]] and the violent drama, mixed with compassion and romantic language, of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref name=keys/>  In addition, Dylan had used rain as a symbol in earlier songs, such as "[[A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall]]".<ref name=keys/>  In his memoir, folk musician [[Dave Van Ronk]] claimed that the song was influenced by an old sentimental ballad, "Chimes of Trinity" by Michael J. Fitzpatrick, which Dave Van Ronk had introduced to Dylan.<ref>{{cite book|title=The mayor of MacDougal Street: a memoir|author=[[Dave Van Ronk|Van Ronk, D.]], Wald, E.|page=4|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2005|isbn=9780306814075}}</ref> 

Despite the song's appeal to cover artists, it has appeared sparingly on Dylan's [[Compilation album|compilation]] and [[live album]]s.  It was, however, included on the 1967 European compilation album ''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits 2]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan|author=Humphries, P.|page=145|year=1995|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-4868-2}}</ref>  A recording of Dylan performing the song at the 1964 [[Newport Folk Festival]] was included on the compilation album, ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]''. The same performance can also be seen on the 2007 DVD ''[[The Other Side of the Mirror (film)|The Other Side of the Mirror: Live at Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Other Side of the Mirror: Live at Newport Folk Festival 1963-1965

As of 2009, Dylan continues to perform "Chimes of Freedom" in concert, although he did not play the song live during the 23 years between late 1964 and 1987.<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{cite web|title=Stockholm, Sweden Globen March 23, 2009|publisher=Bob Links|url=http://www.boblinks.com/032309s.html|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>  In 1993 Dylan played the song in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] as part of [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration as U.S. president.<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{cite web|title=Chimes of Freedom|publisher=[[Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1349221/Chimes-of-Freedom|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>

[[The Byrds]] included a recording of "Chimes of Freedom" on their 1965 debut album, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|page=545|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The song was the last track to be recorded for the album but the [[Studio recording|session]] was marred by conflict and drama.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, C.|page=31|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-90600-215-0}}</ref>  After the band had completed the song's [[instrumental]] backing track, [[guitarist]] and [[Vocal harmony|harmony vocalist]] [[David Crosby]] announced that he wasn't going to sing on the recording and was instead leaving the studio for the day.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|page=76|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The precise reason for Crosby's refusal to sing the song has never been adequately explained but the ensuing fracas between the guitarist and the band's [[Talent manager|manager]], Jim Dickson, ended with Dickson sitting on Crosby's chest, telling him "The only way you're going to get through that door is over my dead body...You're going to stay in this room until you do the vocal."<ref name="rogan">{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|year=1996|title=Mr. Tambourine Man (1996 CD liner notes)}}</ref>  According to a number of people present in the studio that day, Crosby burst into tears but eventually completed the song's harmony part with sterling results.<ref name="timeless"/>   Dickson himself noted in later years that his altercation with Crosby was a cathartic moment in which the singer "got it all out and sang like an angel."<ref name="rogan"/>

The song went on to become a staple of The Byrds' [[Concert|live concert]] repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|pages=591<U+2013>615|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The band also performed the song on the [[television program]]s ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'' and ''[[Shindig!]]'', as well as including it in their performance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].<ref name="timeless2">{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|pages=615<U+2013>616|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-95295-401-X}}</ref>  The Byrds' performance of "Chimes of Freedom" at Monterey can be seen in the 2002 ''[[Monterey Pop|The Complete Monterey Pop Festival]]'' [[DVD]] [[box set]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Complete Monterey Pop Festival - Menu Options|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|url=http://www.allmovie.com/dvd/the-complete-monterey-pop-festival-3-discs-criterion-collection-30998/menu|accessdate=2010-01-19}}</ref>  The song was also performed by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring [[Roger McGuinn]], David Crosby, and [[Chris Hillman]] in January 1989.<ref name="timeless2"/>  In addition to its appearance on ''Mr. Tambourine Man'', "Chimes of Freedom" has appeared on several Byrds' compilation albums, including ''[[The Byrds' Greatest Hits]]'', ''[[The Byrds Play Dylan]]'', ''[[The Very Best of The Byrds]]'',  and ''[[The Essential Byrds]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chimes of Freedom - Byrds Version|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:fzfqxxtsld0e|publisher=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>
