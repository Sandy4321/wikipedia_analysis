'''''Daybreaker''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by British [[metalcore]] band [[Architects (British band)|Architects]]. It was released on 28 May 2012 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe and on 5 June 2012 in the United States. It was the last album to feature guitarist Tim Hillier-Brook, who left the band on 16 April 2012. ''Daybreaker'' was co-produced by the band and Ben Humphreys at [[Outhouse Studios]] in [[Reading, Berkshire]], and used the same team and studio that were used for recording the band's third studio album, ''[[Hollow Crown]]''. ''Daybreaker'' was praised by music writers for its variety and marks Architects' return to the technical sound of their earlier albums{{mdash}}especially ''Hollow Crown''{{mdash}}while incorporating several melodic elements from their fourth album, ''[[The Here and Now]]''.

The album debuted on charts in five countries but failed to appear on any mainstream top 40. To promote it, Architects released five music videos, toured five continents (2012's ''Almost World Tour'' was filmed for the documentary [[One Hundred Days: The Story of Architects Almost World Tour|One Hundred Days]]) and issued a re-release of the album to commemorate their departure from [[Century Media Records]]. ''Daybreaker'' received a mixed to positive response from critics; some praised its use of atmospheric elements and the return to a heavier style, while others criticised it as uninspired.

==Background and recording==

In the band's fourth album, 2011's ''The Here and Now'', the band set out to mix their typical sounds with the music they were listening to at the time. The response was polarised: critics applauded the style while many fans criticised the album and accused the band of selling out.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=69}}<ref name="exclaim.ca-1-Zorgdrager"/> During the publicity for ''The Here and Now'', the band praised it as a progression for them; they did not want to reject an album they had just released.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=69}} But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.<ref name="Rock Sound- WTMW">{{cite journal |last= Sayce |first= Rob |date= July 2013 |title= Welcome To My World: Sam Carter |journal= ''[[Rocksound]]'' |issue= 175 |page = 40 |publisher= Freeway Press |editor= Ben Patashnik| location= London, United Kingdom |issn=1465-0185}}</ref>

Songs recorded during early demo sessions after ''The Here and Now'' became b-sides for re-releases.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=70}} During this time, the band became certain they wished to make another "heavy" record.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=71}} Tom Searle said, "some people might say we've regressed, but I think we've found our enthusiasm for playing heavy music again. I'm excited again by what I've come up with on guitar and lyrically it's much more political and less personal."<ref name="NME-balls">{{cite web|title=Architects 'We've got our balls back |url=http://www.nme.com/news/architects/62951 | work = ''[[NME]]'' | publisher = [[IPC Media <U+2013> Inspire (Time Inc.)]] | date = 20 March 2012 |accessdate=30 March 2012}}</ref> The band started to write socially aware lyrics during the writing phase of ''Daybreaker''; vocalist Sam Carter said this was a result of the band touring the world and seeing things he felt were downplayed by the media.<ref name="Rock Sound- WTMW"/>

Architects invited Jon Green from [[Deez Nuts]], [[Oliver Sykes]] from [[Bring Me the Horizon]], and Drew York from [[Stray from the Path]] to sing on the album. They invited Green because they believed his screaming vocals had a "Satanic" quality,<ref name="AbsPnk-Interview 2013"/> while a collaboration with Sykes was something the band considered "long overdue", since Carter had sung on Bring Me the Horizon's 2008 album ''[[Suicide Season]]''.<ref name="AbsPnk-Interview 2013">{{cite web|url = http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3265671 | title = Architects (UK) - 06.26.13 | author = Jake Denning | publisher = [[Absolute Punk]] | date = 26 June 2013 | accessdate = 10 September 2013}}</ref> On 16 April 2013, shortly before ''Daybreaker''{{'s}} release, Hillier-Brook announced he would leave the band to pursue other projects.<ref name="RS-hiller">{{cite web|url = http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/architects-part-ways-with-guitarist | title = Architects Part Ways With Guitarist |work= ''[[Rocksound]]'' |publisher= Freeway Press |editor= Ben Patashnik| location= London, United Kingdom |issn=1465-0185 | date = 16 April 2012 | accessdate = 10 December 2013 }}</ref> The band had thought Hiller-Brook seemed unhappy while he was a member of Architects.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=71}}

===Singles===
In early November 2011, Architects announced a plan to release "Devil's Island", the first song from the then-unnamed follow-up to their fourth studio album ''[[The Here and Now]]''. They released it on 4 December 2011, with a b-side song called "Untitled".{{#tag:ref|The song is not untitled: "Untitled" is its title.|group="note"}} Both the song and the accompanying music video reference [[2011 England riots|rioting in England in 2011]], and the music video features clips of the riots.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nme.com/nme-video/architects---devils-island/1282245225001 | title = Architects - 'Devils Island' video | work = ''[[NME]]'' | publisher = [[IPC Media <U+2013> Inspire (Time Inc.)]] | date = 4 December 2012 | accessdate = 17 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="Thrash-DevilsIsland"/> "Devil's Island" was well received by critics for its return to the [[mathcore]] style of their third album, ''Hollow Crown''.

According to Andrew Kelham, ''Daybreaker'' is an "urgent and resurgent" record;{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=69}} it has been identified by critics as [[metalcore]],<ref name="exclaim.ca-2-Harms"/><ref name="Jervis"/> [[progressive metal]],<ref name="CA-live"/><ref name="Haridimou"/> [[post-hardcore]]<ref name="Jervis"/> and mathcore.<ref name="Haridimou"/> Architects have been credited for fusing the intense technicality and metallic style of ''Hollow Crown'' with the "soaring vocals" and the much improved production of ''The Here and Now''.<ref name="exclaim.ca-2-Harms"/><ref name="Rees"/> The album is defined by a number of features, including a contrast of singing and [[extreme metal]] [[screaming (music)|screaming]],<ref name="Von Bader"/> and melodic choruses complemented by "soaring" vocals,<ref name="exclaim.ca-2-Harms"/><ref name="Hagen"/> technical guitar work with [[palm mute]]d [[breakdown (music)|breakdowns]]<ref name="Rees"/><ref name="Rauf"/> and the use of string instruments and piano to generate atmosphere.<ref name="Rees"/> ''Daybreaker'' is noted for fusing influences from Architects' previous two albums ''The Here And Now'' and ''Hollow Crown'';<ref name="exclaim.ca-2-Harms"/><ref name="Rees"/> many reviewers have cited the album as a return to the band's heavier, more technical roots.<ref name="Haridimou"/> When he interviewed the band, Kelham wrote, "some will see ''Daybreaker'' as a apology, but it's not. Others will view it as a hasty attempt to claw back the glories of third album ''Hollow Crown'', but it's not that either. It's a collection of songs about moving on, growing up and making sense of what has come before".{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=71}}

The record's opening track is "The Bitter End", an introduction built on skittish electronics,<ref name="CA-live">{{cite web|url = http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2013/11/21/concert-preview-architects-build-a-winner-with-daybreaker.html | title =  Concert preview: Architects build a winner with Daybreaker | author = Andy Downing | work = [[Columbus Alive!]] | publisher =  [[The Dispatch Printing Company]] | date = 21 November 2013| accessdate = 20 December 2013}}</ref> dark piano chords, xylophone notes, orchestral harmonies, haunting vocals and lyrics.<ref name="Haridimou"/><ref name="Bird"/> The album then breaks into intense and heavy songs such as "high-octane" tracks "Alpha Omega"<ref name="Rauf"/> and "These Colours Don't Run", which are full of "interesting rhythms and powerful melodies".<ref name="Rauf"/>

{{Quote box |salign=center|quote=It was the first time we'd written a song about something that was relevant socially and not just based on what I had directly experience through life or something else. It was bigger-picture, and when we released it that song got people talking about something broader than whether on not they think [[Bring Me the Horizon]] are better than Architects or vice versa.|source=Sam Carter's response when asked about the writing phase of ''Daybreaker'' and ''Devil's Island'' in an interview in 2012.{{sfn|Kelham|2012|p=70}}|align=right|width=33%}}

Lyrically, the album discusses negative aspects of religion and society,<ref name="Hagen"/> and is seen as a "companion piece" to Enter Shikari<U+2019>s [[A Flash Flood of Colour|''A Flash Flood of Colour'']].<ref name="Hagen"/> ''Daybreaker''{{'s}} lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and "bigger picture" themes.<ref name="Kerrang 1397"/> Carter described "Devil's Island" as "one of the hardest songs to write" because of the prominence of its theme of rioting.<ref name="AbsPnk-Interview 2013"/> Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution".<ref name="Big Cheese- DI">{{cite web|url = http://www.bigcheesemagazine.com/videos/article/architects-devils-island | title = Architects - Devil<U+2019>s Island | work = [[Big Cheese Magazine]] | date = 15 November 2011 | accessdate = 11 December 2013}}</ref> Carter said "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what we really could do and how we could stabilize what's really going on in the world right now".<ref name="AbsPnk-Interview 2013"/>

''Daybreaker'' received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Some reviewers praised the band for texturing and progressing their sound, and for writing socio-political lyrics.<ref name="Hagen"/> The album was criticised for sounding forced or formulaic.<ref name="exclaim.ca-1-Zorgdrager"/> At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, ''Daybreaker'' received an average score of 73, based on 8 reviews, which indicates generally favourable reviews.<ref name="metacritic"/>

[[About.com]] writer Ryan Cooper praised the album, awarded it four stars out of five and said it "laughs in the face of those who think passionate realism, artistic integrity and mass commercial appeal are all mutually exclusive. Daybreaker balances all three with pretty much perfect dexterity."<ref name="Jervis"/><ref name="Sterdan"/> Raziq Rauf writing for the [[BBC]] praised the band for the album's musical diversity with its use of electronic songs like album-opener "The Bitter End" and the band's use of technicality and melody in songs. He summarised the album by saying, "Daybreaker is a great album. It<U+2019>ll go down as one of Architects<U+2019> finest works{{mdash}}it<U+2019>s certainly their most well-rounded release to date."<ref name="Rauf"/> [[Big Cheese (magazine)|''Big Cheese'']] writer Paul Hagen praised the album's lyrical content, saying, "Socially turbulent times seems to produce the best music and if bands can keep channelling genuine anger into their art, there are going to be some more really great albums released over the next few years".<ref name="Hagen"/>

Canadian music magazine [[Exclaim!|''Exclaim!'']] published two reviews of ''Daybreaker''. Bradley Zorgdrager gave an unfavourable review of the album's sound. He said although the tracks are "catchy and occasionally compelling, they're essentially identical and formulaic, as the atmospheric build-ups and soaring riffs make way for boring breakdowns. The metal-influenced parts sound forced to appease fans disappointed with their last release, which results in Daybreaker sounding more like a business move than a work of art."<ref name="exclaim.ca-1-Zorgdrager"/> Scott Harms' review was more favourable, praising the band's return to a much more aggressive style. He credits it for incorporating influences from previous albums, saying "they have found a balance in which to return to the Searle brothers' heavy sounds while carefully incorporating Sam Carter's soaring clean vocals". Harms summarised his review by saying, "as a whole, [''Daybreaker''] sounds epic".<ref name="exclaim.ca-2-Harms">{{cite web|url = http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/architects-daybreaker_2 | title = Architects - Daybreaker <U+2022> Metal Reviews <U+2022> exclaim.ca | author = Scott Harms | work = | publisher = [[Exclaim.ca]] | accessdate = 7 July 2012 | quote = }}</ref> Adam Rees of [[Metal Hammer|''Metal Hammer'']] rated the album 7 out of 10, acknowledging the "abundant" inclusion of string instruments and piano and the way these instruments create atmosphere.<ref name="Rees"/> Ress ended his review by calling ''Daybreaker'', "A brave and brilliant British metal album".<ref name="Rees"/> [[Canoe.ca]] author Darryl Sterdan awarded the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying it  "balanc[es] their newfound sensitivity and maturity with plenty of good old-fashioned techno-metal frenzy and primal-scream aggro. Pity they didn<U+2019>t write memorable songs while they were at it."<ref name="Sterdan"/>

''Alt Sounds'' writer Candice Haridimou gave the album a rating of 94% out of 100% and praised the album's lyrical content. She said the political nature of the album also uses emotional dramatisation to capture the listener, particularly in songs like "Devil's Island". Haridimou states the song "drives remorse into the cold hearts of those involved. It<U+2019>s a severe and poignant song that will stand the test of time."<ref name="Haridimou">{{cite web|url = http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/148750-review-architects-uk-daybreaker-album.html | title = Review: Architects UK <U+2013> Daybreaker Album | author = Candice Haridimou | publisher = [[Alt Sounds]] | date = 11 June 2012 | accessdate = 15 July 2012 | quote = }}</ref> Ryan Bird, in an otherwise positive review of ''Daybreaker'', criticised it upon first hearing it; he said it struggled to settle into any distinctive rhythm or groove.<ref name="Bird"/> However, Bird concluded his review by saying, "but despite its relative (and relatively few) faults. 'Daybreaker' represents a victory for a band who some had once been so eager to write off, suggesting that maybe{{mdash}}just maybe{{mdash}}they've got what it takes to bring both sides [of their fanbase] together".<ref name="Bird"/>
