==History==

===1975<U+2013>77===
In 1975, the [[Austria]]n [[naturalized]] [[Canadian]] businessman [[Walter Wolf]] had started to appear at many of the F1 races during the season. A year later, he bought 60% of [[Frank Williams Racing Cars]] while agreeing to keep Frank Williams as manager of the team. Simultaneously Wolf bought the assets of the [[Hesketh Racing|Hesketh]] team that had recently withdrawn from F1. The team was based in the Williams facility at Reading but used most of the cars and equipment once owned by Hesketh Racing. The Hesketh 308C became known as the Wolf-Williams FW05 and soon afterwards Dr. [[Harvey Postlethwaite]] arrived as chief engineer. [[Jacky Ickx]] and Frenchman [[Michel Lecl<U+00E8>re]] were hired to drive. The team, however, was not very competitive and failed to qualify at a number of races during the year. Lecl<U+00E8>re left after the [[French Grand Prix]] and was replaced by [[Arturo Merzario]] while Ickx failed to perform and was dropped after the [[British Grand Prix]], to be followed by a string of pay-drivers.

At the end of [[1976 Formula One season|1976]], Wolf decided that the team needed restructuring. He removed [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] from the manager's job and replaced him with [[Peter Warr]] from [[Team Lotus]].  Disillusioned, Williams soon left the team, taking [[Patrick Head]] and several others to set up [[WilliamsF1|Williams Grand Prix Engineering]]. Postlethwaite's WR1 was a conventional [[Cosworth]] package but with [[Jody Scheckter]] hired from [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], the new-look team presented a strong package. No one, however, expected that the team would win [[1977 Argentine Grand Prix|its first race in Argentina]]. It was in many respects a lucky win, with Scheckter starting tenth with six of the cars ahead of him retiring.  During the 1977 season, Scheckter went on to win the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] and the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] and also six other podium finishes which enabled him to finish second to [[Niki Lauda]] in the [[1977 Formula One season|World Championship]] and gave Wolf fourth place in the Constructors' Championship.

Around this time the team developed the WD1 sports car for [[Can-Am]] racing. The car was developed with Italian firm [[Dallara]].<ref>[http://www.racingsportscars.com/type/photo/Wolf/Dallara%20WD1.html Wolf Dallara WD1 - Photo Gallery - Racing Sports Cars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===1978<U+2013>79===
The team remained the same for the 1978 season. Postlethwaite produced the WR5, a new car for the ground-effects era. This did not appear until the Belgian GP. Scheckter finished fourth in [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and second in [[German Grand Prix|Germany]] but the WR5 soon made way for the WR6 with which he ended the year with a third in the [[US Grand Prix]] and second in [[Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. He finished seventh in the [[1978 Formula One season|World Championship]].

In 1979, Scheckter was signed up by [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and Wolf signed [[James Hunt]] to replace him. Postlethwaite designed the WR7 which ran with [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] sponsorship. The car was not very successful and retired more than 7 times during the first half of the season. The WR8 soon followed. In mid-season Hunt decided to retire and Wolf quickly hired [[Keke Rosberg]] to replace him. The appearance of the WR9 did little to change the team's fortunes and at the end of the year Wolf grew tired of his F1 adventure and sold the team to [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who merged its assets into [[Fittipaldi Automotive]].

A Wolf Racing WR1 is on display at the [[Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame]].

James Hunt's WR7 is on display at the Cotswold Motor Museum in Bourton-on-the-water, UK.

==Other motorsport ventures==
The team re-emerged during the 1980s as a [[Touring car racing|Touring Car]] team as [[Ford Germany]]'s representative in [[Group A]] competition. The team was not just a racing team but a constructor, building [[Ford Sierra RS500]] cars for themselves, and for other teams either complete or in semi-built kit form. The team became a default choice for Sierra availability as output from other sources, Eggenberger Motorsport, Rousesport and [[Dick Johnson Racing]] was limited.

Walter Wolf was also involved in production cars, providing assistance to [[Lamborghini]] to develop the [[Lamborghini Countach|Countach]] as the Italian constructor teetered on the brink of [[bankruptcy]].<ref>[http://www.viathema.com/lamborghini/ Lamborghini Classic & Collector Cars for Sale - viathema.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
