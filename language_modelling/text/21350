Male [[circumcision]], when practiced as a rite, is found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic Covenant|Abrahamic covenant]], such as {{bibleverse||Genesis|17|HE}}, and is therefore practiced by [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s and some [[Christians]], those who constitute the [[Abrahamic religions]].

Cultures circumcising males generally do it shortly after birth, during childhood or around puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision is most prevalent in Muslim countries and Israel, and is most prevalent in the [[Jew]]ish and [[Muslim]] faiths, though also common in the United States, Canada, the Philippines, South Korea, and Ethiopia, which are predominately Christian. It is less common in Europe, Latin America, China and India. Hodges argues that in Ancient Greece the [[foreskin]] was valued and that Greek and Roman attempts to abolish ritual circumcision were prompted by humanitarian concerns.<ref>{{cite journal

[[History of male circumcision|Circumcision has a long history]], and is mentioned frequently in the [[Bible]]. However, it should be noted that the Bible means different things to different religious groups.

# For [[Jew]]s, the Bible consists of the 24 books in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (and some [[Biblical Aramaic]]) that are known as the [[Tanakh]].
# For [[Protestant]] Christians, the Bible consists of the 39 books of the [[Old Testament]] (following [[Jerome]]'s ''Veritas Hebraica'') plus the 27 books of the [[New Testament]].
# For [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] and most [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christians, the Bible includes several other books known as the [[Deuterocanonical]] books, the list being slightly different for each group. In addition, some Orthodox Christians have additional New Testament books, such as the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Armenian Orthodox]], or less, such as the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], see [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon]].

==In the Jewish Bible==
There are numerous references to circumcision in the [[Jewish Bible]]. Circumcision was enjoined upon the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], his descendants and their slaves as "a token of the covenant" concluded with him by [[God]] for all generations, an "everlasting covenant" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:13|HE}}), thus it is commonly observed by the [[Abrahamic religions]].

The penalty of non-observance was ''karet'', excision from the people ({{bibleverse||Genesis|17:10-14|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|21:4|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Lev|12:3|HE}}).  Non-Israelites had to undergo circumcision before they could be allowed to take part in the feast of [[Passover]] ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}), or marry into a Jewish family ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:14-16|HE}}). See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Mosaic Law directed at non-Jews]] and [[Conversion to Judaism]].

It was "a reproach" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ({{bibleverse||Josh|5:9|HE}})  The name ''arelim'' (uncircumcised) became an opprobrious term, especially a pejorative name for the [[Philistines]], who might have been of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, in the context of the fierce wars recounted in the [[Book of Samuel]] ({{bibleverse|1|Sam|14:6|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|1|Sam|31:4|HE}}. When the general (and future king) [[David]] wanted to marry [[King Saul]]'s daughter, the King rquiered a grisly "[[dowry]]" of a hundred Philistine foreskins. David went one better: "and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife".({{bibleverse|1|Sam|18:25|HE}})  

"Uncircumcised" is not, however, used in relation to [[Semitic]] non-Israelite neighbors such as the [[Moab]]ites, [[Amon]]ites and [[Edom]]ites, who were culturally similar to the Israleites amd might have also practiced circumcision. 

"Uncircumcised" is used synonymously with ''tame'' (unclean) for heathen ({{bibleverse||Isa|52:1|HE}}). The word 'arel' (uncircumcised) is also employed for "unclean" (Lev. 26:41, "their uncircumcised hearts"; compare Jer. 9:25; Ezek. xliv. 7, 9); it is even applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ({{bibleverse||Lev|19:23|HE}}).

However, the Israelites born in the wilderness after the exodus from [[Egypt]] apparently did not carry out the practice of circumcision. According to {{bibleverse||Josh|5:2-9|HE}}, "all the people that came out" of Egypt were circumcised, but those "born in the wilderness" were not. In any case, we are told that [[Joshua]], before the celebration of the Passover, had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]].

The Bible contains several narratives in which circumcision is mentioned. There is the circumcision and massacre of the [[Shechem]]ites ({{bibleverse||Genesis|34:1-35:5|HE}}), the hundred [[foreskin]] dowry ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:25-27|HE}}) and the story of the LORD threatening to kill Moses, and being placated by Zipporah's circumcision of their son ({{bibleverse||Exodus|4:24-26|HE}}), and the ''Circumcision at Gilgal'' of {{bibleverse||Joshua|5|HE}}.

There is another sense in which the term "circumcise" is used in the Bible. {{bibleverse||Deut|10:16|HE}} says: "''Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,''" (also quoted in {{bibleverse||Jer|4:4}}, [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translates as: "Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts") along with {{bibleverse||Jer|6:10|HE}}: ''To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: ...'' (New JPS translates: "Their ears are blocked"). Some interpret this as giving the rite a spiritual meaning; circumcision as a physical act being enjoined nowhere in the book.  {{bibleverse||Jer|9:25-26|HE}} says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for "all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart." The New JPS translation adds the note: "''uncircumcised of heart'': I.e., their minds are blocked to God's commandments." Non-Jewish tribes that practiced circumcision were described as being "circumcised in uncircumcision."({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|9:24|HE}})

==In Judaism==
{{main|Brit milah}}

Judaism teaches that the Bible was transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, known as the [[oral law]].  Jewish practices and beliefs, thus, are based on reading the Bible through the perspective of the oral law; see the entries on the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and [[rabbinic literature]].

According to [[Jewish law]], ritual circumcision of male children is a commandment from God that Jews are obligated to follow, and is only postponed or abrogated in the case of threat to the life or health of the child.<ref name="GlassJM">{{cite journal

</ref>; Jews do not believe that non-Jews are obligated to follow this commandment, instead only [[Noahide laws]] apply. Many Christians have the same understanding of this issue (i.e., that it is a law intended for Jews, but not for Christians), see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Dual-covenant theology]].

===In rabbinic literature===
During the [[Babylon]]ian exile, [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] and circumcision became the characteristic symbols of the Jewish people. This seems to be the underlying idea of Isa. lvi. 4: "The [[eunuchs]] that keep my Sabbath" still "hold fast by my covenant," though not having "the sign of the covenant" (Gen. xvii. 11.) upon their flesh.

Contact with Greek polytheistic culture, especially at the games of the arena, made this distinction obnoxious to [[Hellenistic Judaism|Jewish-Hellenists]] seeking to [[Hellenization|assimilate into Greek culture]]. The consequence was their attempt to appear like the Greeks by [[epispasm]] ("making themselves foreskins"; {{bibleverse|1|Macc|1:15|NRSV}}; Josephus, [http://earlyjewishwritings.com/text/josephus/ant12.html Ant. xii] 5, <U+00A7> 1; [[Assumption of Moses]], viii.; {{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}};, Tosef.; Talmud tractes Shabbat xv. 9; Yevamot 72a, b; Yerushalmi Peah i. 16b; Yevamot viii. 9a).  Also, some Jews at this time stopped circumcising their children. {{bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}} records that the [[Maccabean]] zealots "forcibly circumcised all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel."

The [[Rabbis]] also took action to ensure that the practice of circumcision did not die out. In order to prevent the obliteration of the "seal of the covenant"  on the flesh, as circumcision was henceforth called, the Rabbis, probably after [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], instituted the "peri'ah" (the laying bare of the [[glans penis|glans]]), without which circumcision was declared to be of no value (Shab. xxx. 6).

To be [[Aposthia|born without a foreskin]] was regarded as the privilege of the most saintly of people, from [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], "who was made in the image of God," and [[Moses]] to [[Zerubbabel]] (see Midrash Ab. R. N., ed. Schechter, p. 153; and Talmud, Sotah 12a).

Uncircumcision being considered a blemish, circumcision was to remove it, and to render Abraham and his descendants "perfect" (Talmud Ned. 31b; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.) 

Rabbinic literature holds that one who removes his circumcision has no portion in [[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]] (Mishnah Ab. iii. 17; Midrash Sifre, Num. xv. 31; Talmud Sanhedrin 99).

According to the Midrash Pirke R. El. xxix., it was [[Shem]] who circumcised [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] on the [[Day of Atonement]]; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before God on that day to serve as an atoning power. According to the same midrash, [[Pharaoh]] prevented the Hebrew slaves from performing the rite, but when the [[Passover]] time came and brought them deliverance, they underwent circumcision, and mingled the blood of the paschal lamb with that of the Abrahamic covenant, wherefore (Ezek. xvi. 6) God repeats the words: "In thy blood live!"

===Converts to Judaism===
In the first century of the common era, the requirement for circumcision of [[proselytes]] was an open issue between the [[zealot]]s and liberal parties in ancient Israel, before the [[Mishnah]] was edited and the [[halakah]] (Jewish law) finalized, the time of the [[Tannaim]].

[[Joshua ben Hananiah|R. Joshua]] asserting that along with accepting Jewish beliefs and laws, immersion in a [[mikvah|mikveh]] (ritual bath, cf. [[baptism]]) was enough for someone to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert to Judaism]]. In contrast, [[R. Eliezer]] makes circumcision a condition for the conversion. A similar controversy between the [[Shammai]]tes and the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]] is given (Shab. 137a) regarding a proselyte [[Aposthia|born without a foreskin]]: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood of the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.

The rigorous view is echoed in the [[Midrash]]: "If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], they shall not enter the [[Promised Land|land of promise]]" (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.).  "The [[Godfearers|Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised]] are intruders, and deserve punishment," (Midrash Deut. Rabbah i.)

It appears that while the Palestinian Jews accepted the uncircumcised proselytes only as "Proselytes of the Gate", non-Palestinian Judaism did not make such a distinction until the [[Jewish-Roman wars]], when the more rigorous view became prevalent everywhere. Thus [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Flavius Clemens]], a nephew of the emperors [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]], when, with his wife Domitilla, he embraced the Jewish faith; he underwent circumcision, for which he suffered the penalty of death (see Gr<U+00E4>tz, "Gesch." iv. 403 et seq., 702).

It was chiefly this rigorous feature of Jewish proselytism which provoked the hostile measures of the emperor [[Hadrian]]. And, furthermore, it was the discussion of this same question among the Jews&mdash;whether the seal of circumcision might not find its substitute in "the seal of [[baptism]]" &mdash; which led [[Paul of Tarsus]] to urge the latter in opposition to the former ({{bibleverse||Romans|2:25-29}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Romans|4:11-12}}, and elsewhere), just as he was led to adopt the [[antinomianism|antinomistic]] or antinational view, which had its exponents in [[Alexandria]].

[[Flavius Josephus]] in [[Jewish Antiquities]] [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/josephus/ant-20.htm book 20], chapter 2 recorded the story of [[Izates bar Monobaz|King Izates]] of [[Adiabene]] who decided to follow the [[Law of Moses]] at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects wouldn't stand to be ruled by someone who followed such "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision ([[Robert Eisenman]] in ''James the Brother of Jesus'' claims that Ananias is [[Paul of Tarsus]] who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.

===Normative position===
It has become generally accepted in all branches of Judaism that circumcision is an essential requirement for Jews. Subject to overriding medical considerations, the circumcision must take place eight days after the birth of the child, even when this falls on ''Shabbat'';<ref>Tractate Shabbat. xix. 1.</ref> but [[Samaritans]] and [[Karaite Judaism]] do not follow this rule. The child must be medically fit for a circumcision to be performed, and Jewish law prohibits parents having their son circumcised if medical doctors hold that the procedure may unduly threaten the child's health (e.g. because of [[hemophilia]]). If by reason of the child's debility or sickness the ceremony is postponed, it cannot take place on ''Shabbat''.<ref>Talmud Shabbat 137a.</ref> 

It is the duty of the father to have his child circumcised; and if he fails in this, the [[beth din]] of the city must see that the rite is performed<ref>Talmud Kid. 29a.</ref> In the absence of a Jewish expert, a non-Jewish physician may, according to R. Me<U+00EF>r, perform the ceremony, as may women, slaves, and children.<ref>Talmud Avodah Zarah 26b; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, ii. 1; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, l.c.</ref>

However important it may be, circumcision is not a [[sacrament]], unlike a Christian baptism. Circumcision does not affect a Jew's Jewish status. A Jew by birth is a full Jew, even if not circumcised.<ref>Talmud Hul. 4b; Avodah Zarah 27a; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, 264, 1.</ref>

==Islam==
[[Image:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence at Country Level.png|thumb|Map published by the United Nations ([[World Health Organization|WHO]]/[[UNAIDS]]) showing percentage of males who have been circumcised, at a country level.

The origin of circumcision in [[Islam]] is a matter of religious and scholarly debate. It is mentioned in some ''[[hadith]]'', but not in the [[Qur'an]]. Some [[Fiqh]] scholars state that circumcision is ''recommended'' ([[Sunnah]]); others that it is ''obligatory''.<ref>{{cite web

The timing of Muslim circumcision varies. Turkish, [[Balkan]], rural Egyptians and Central and South Asian Muslims typically circumcise boys between the ages of six and eleven {{Fact|date=July 2007}}. Traditionally, Turkish circumcisions are celebrated with sweets and the "S<U+00FC>nnet D<U+00FC><U+011F><U+00FC>n<U+00FC>", or "Circumcision Feast/Celebration." It is considered a very important celebration in man's life as a passage to a manhood. However, in the middle class circumcision is more usually done in infancy.<ref>Hamdullah Ayd<U+0131>n, M.D. and Zeynep G<U+00FC>l<U+00E7>at, Ph.D., "Turkey," in ''The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality'', http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/IES/turkey.html#5 retrieved [[8 July]] [[2007]].</ref> In [[Pakistan]], Muslims may be circumcised at all ages from the newborn period to adulthood, though the medical profession has encouraged medical circumcisions in the first week after birth to reduce complications: "Circumcision is performed by barbers, medical technicians, quacks and doctors including paediatric surgeon[s] [and as] yet there is no consensus for the best age and method."<ref>Iftikhar Ahmad Jan, "Circumcision in babies and children with Plastibell technique: An easy procedure with minimal complications - Experience of 316 cases," Pak J Med Sci 2004, 20(3) 175-180.</ref>  In Iran, Dr. Paula Drew states that <U+201C>circumcision, which formerly celebrated the onset of manhood, has for many years now been more customarily performed at the age of 5 or 6 for children born at home, and at two days old for those born in a medical setting.<U+2026>By puberty, all Muslim Iranian boys must be circumcised if they are to participate fully in religious activities.<U+201D><ref>{{cite encyclopedia

==In the Deuterocanon/Biblical Apocrypha==
The [[Deuterocanon]]/[[Biblical Apocrypha]] reveal the cultural clash between [[Jews]] and [[Greeks]], and between [[Judaizers]] and [[Hellenization|Hellenizers]]. Greeks valued the foreskin, and when they took part in athletic sports, they did it in the nude [http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/]. However, they insisted that the glans remained covered, and they did not approve of the Jewish custom of circumcision. The [[Books of the Maccabees]] reveal that some Jewish men chose to undergo ''epispasm'', [[foreskin restoration]] by stretching the residual skin [http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/hall1/], so that they could conform to Greek culture and take part in these sports. ({{bibleverse|1|Macc|1:11-15|NRSV}}). Some also left their sons uncircumcised ({{bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). This relatively peaceful period came to an end when [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] attacked first Egypt and then sacked and looted Jerusalem ({{bibleverse|1|Macc|1:16-64|NRSV}}). Epiphanes determined to force everyone to [[Hellenization|live the Greek way]] and abandon the [[Judaizing|Jewish way]]. Among other things, he banned circumcision.

Though many were prepared to conform to Greek culture, observant Jews saw circumcision as a mark of Jewish loyalty and many who kept to the [[Mosaic Law]] defied the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision ({{bibleverse|1|Macc|1:48|NRSV}},{{bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|1:60|NRSV}}; {{bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons. "For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. They publicly paraded them around the city, with their babies hanging at their breasts, and then hurled them down headlong from the wall." ({{bibleverse|2|Macc|6:10|NRSV}}) At the same time, the Zealots forcibly circumcised the uncircumcised boys within the borders of Israel ({{bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}).

In the upshot, the Jewish Zealots defeated the Greeks and they retained the right to circumcise.

The [[Book of Jubilees]], part of the Bible of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]], written in the time of [[John Hyrcanus]], reveals the hostility directed against those who abandoned circumcision (xv. 26-27): "Whosoever is uncircumcised belongs to 'the sons of [[Belial]],' to 'the children of doom and eternal perdition'; for all the angels of the Presence and of the Glorification have been so from the day of their creation, and God's anger will be kindled against the children of the covenant if they make the members of their body appear like those of the [[Gentiles]], and they will be expelled and exterminated from the earth".

According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] saying 53, [[Jesus]] says:
:"His disciples said to him, "is circumcision useful or not?" He said to them, "If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect."" SV [http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm]

Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul's {{bibleverse||Romans|2:29}}, {{bibleverse||Philippians|3:3}}, {{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}}, {{bibleverse||Gal|6:15}}, {{bibleverse||Col|2:11-12}}.

The [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&letter=G#543 Jewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah] states: 
{{cquote|R. Emden (), in a remarkable apology for Christianity contained in his appendix to "Seder 'Olam" (pp. 32b-34b, Hamburg, 1752), gives it as his opinion that the original intention of Jesus, and especially of Paul, was to convert only the [[Gentiles]] to the [[Seven Laws of Noah|seven moral laws of Noah]] and to let the Jews follow the Mosaic law&mdash; which explains the apparent contradictions in the New Testament regarding the [[Biblical law in Christianity|laws of Moses]] and the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]].}}

==In Christianity==
{{seealso|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity}}

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about biblical male circumcision, neither requiring it nor forbidding it. The [[Council of Jerusalem|first Church Council in Jerusalem]] declared that circumcision was not necessary ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015 Acts 15]). It is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches <ref name=Christian>Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
*"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians<U+2014> two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity<U+2014> retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since Jesus was circumcised and the Bible teaches the practice." 

*"The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by Coptic Christians." [http://www.bartleby.com/65/ci/circumci.html "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05.</ref>.

While [[Circumcision of Christ|Jesus' circumcision]] was recorded as having been performed in accordance with [[Torah]] requirements in {{bibleverse||Luke|2:21}}, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], chapter 15, the leaders of the Christian Church at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] rejected circumcision as a requirement for [[Gentile]] [[Religious conversion|converts]], possibly the first act of differentiation of Early Christianity from its Jewish roots<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems," 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition."</ref>, see also [[List of events in early Christianity]].   [[Paul of Tarsus]], who called himself ''Apostle to the Gentiles'', attacked the practice, but not consistently, for example in one case he personally circumcised Timothy "because of the Jews" that were in town (Timothy had a [[Jewish Christian]] mother but a Greek father {{bibleverse||Acts|16:1-3}}).<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/mcgarvey/acts.ch16.html McGarvey on Acts 16]: "Yet we see him in the case before us, circumcising Timothy with his own hand, and this 'on account of certain Jews who were in those quarters.'"</ref>  He also appeared to praise its value in {{bibleverse||Rom|3:1-2}}. Paul argued that circumcision no longer meant the physical, but a spiritual practice ({{bibleverse||Rom|2:25-29}}).  And in that sense, he wrote {{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}}: "Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised" -- probably a reference to the practice of [[epispasm]] <ref>"making themselves foreskins"; I Macc. i. 15; Josephus, "Ant." xii. 5, <U+00A7> 1; Assumptio Mosis, viii.; I Cor. vii. 18;, Tosef.; Talmud tractes Shabbat xv. 9; Yevamot 72a, b; Yerushalmi Peah i. 16b; Yevamot viii. 9a; [http://www.cirp.org/library/restoration/rubin/]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Circumcision]: "To this epispastic operation performed on the athletes to conceal the marks of circumcision St. Paul alludes, me epispastho ({{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:18}})."</ref>. Paul was circumcised when he was "called." He added: "Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.", and went on to argue that circumcision didn't matter: "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. [[Law in Christianity|Keeping God's commands]] is what counts." ({{bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}})

Later he more explicitly denounced the practice, rejecting and condemning those who promoted circumcision to Gentile Christians. He accused Galatian Christians who [[Circumcision advocacy|advocated circumcision]] of turning from the Spirit to the flesh.  And in {{bibleverse||Gal|3:3}} says "Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?"  He accused circumcision advocates of wanting to make a good showing in the flesh {{bibleverse||Gal|6:12}} and of  glorying or boasting of the flesh {{bibleverse||Gal|6:13}}. Some believe Paul wrote the entire book of Galatians attacking circumcision and requiring the keeping of Jewish law by Christians,{{Who|date=April 2008}} saying in chapter five:  "If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing."

In a late letter he warned Christians to beware of the concision, or mutilation<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=2699 Blue Letter Bible. Strong's G2699]</ref>, saying that Christians were the true circumcision because they worshipped in the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit of God]] ({{bibleverse||Phil|3:2-3}}).

The Catholic Encyclopedia's entry on Judaizers notes: "Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the Mosaic Law, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the Gentiles, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required ({{bibleverse|1|Cor|9:20}}). Thus he shortly after circumcised Timothy ({{bibleverse||Acts|16:1-3}}), and he was in the very act of observing the Mosaic ritual when he was arrested at Jerusalem ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|21:26}} sqq.)."<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Judaizers]</ref>

[[Simon Peter]], who for Catholic Christians is the first [[Pope]], condemned circumcision for converts according to {{bibleverse||Acts|15}}. Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, charged that the advocates of circumcision were "false brothers" ({{bibleverse||Gal|2:4}}).  Some Biblical scholars think that the [[Epistle of Titus]], generally attributed to Paul, may state that circumcision should be discouraged among Christians ({{bibleverse||Titus|1:10-16}}), though others believe this is merely a reference to Jews. Circumcision was so closely associated with Jewish men that [[Jewish Christians]] were referred to as "those of the circumcision" ({{bibleverse||Col|3:20}}) [http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass1/] or conversely Christians who were circumcised were referred to as Jewish Christians or [[Judaizers]]. These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean [[Jews]] and [[Greeks]], who were predominate, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century [[Iudaea Province]] also had some Jews who no longer circumcised, and some Greeks (called Proselytes or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did.

In the Gospel of {{bibleverse||John|7:23}} Jesus is reported as giving this response to those who criticized him for healing on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]: "If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?"

This passage has been seen as a comment on the Rabbinic belief that circumcision heals the penis (Jerusalem Bible, note to {{bibleverse||John|7:23}}) or as a criticism of circumcision [http://www.cirp.org/pages/cultural/glass1/].

The Greek Orthodox Church celebrates the [[Circumcision of Christ]] on [[1 January]],<ref>[http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/calendar.asp?Y=2007&M=1 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese calendar of Holy Days]</ref> while Orthodox churches following the [[Julian calendar]] celebrate it on [[14 January]].

=== The Roman Catholic Church ===

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] denounced religious circumcision for its members in the ''Cantate Domino'', written during the 11th [[Council of Florence]] in 1442. <ref name = "CoF">{{cite book| last = Eugenius IV| first = Pope| authorlink = Pope Eugene IV| editor = Norman P.

Whoever, after the Passion, places his hope in the legal prescriptions and submits himself to them as necessary for salvation and as if faith in Christ without them could not save, sins mortally. It does not deny that from Christ's passion until the promulgation of the Gospel they could have been retained, provided they were in no way believed to be necessary for salvation. But it asserts that after the promulgation of the gospel they cannot be observed without loss of eternal salvation. Therefore it denounces all who after that time observe circumcision, the [Jewish] sabbath and other legal prescriptions as strangers to the faith of Christ and unable to share in eternal salvation, unless they recoil at some time from these errors. Therefore it strictly orders all who glory in the name of Christian, not to practise circumcision either before or after baptism, since whether or not they place their hope in it, it cannot possibly be observed without loss of eternal salvation.</small>}}</ref> This decision was based on the belief that [[baptism]] had [[Supersessionism|superseded]] circumcision ({{bibleverse||Col|2:11-12}}),<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03777a.htm ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'': Circumcision]</ref> and may also have been a response to [[Coptic Christians]], who continued to practice circumcision.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}  The modern Roman Catholic Church maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision, and has never addressed the issue of infant circumcision specifically.<ref name=Slosar>{{cite journal |last=Slosar |first=J.P. |authorlink= |coauthors=D.

Some Catholic scholars, such as Fr. John J.
