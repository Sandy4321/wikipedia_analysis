'''Henri Huet''' ([[April 4]], [[1927]] - [[10 February]], [[1971]]) was a [[War photography|war photographer]], noted for his work covering the [[Vietnam War]] for [[Associated Press]] (AP).

==Early life==
Huet was born in [[Dalat|Da Lat]], Vietnam, the son of a French father and Vietnamese mother. He moved to France with his family when he was five years old and was educated at [[Saint-Malo]] in [[Brittany]]. After leaving school he studied at the art school in [[Rennes]] and began his adult career as a painter. He later joined the French army and received training in photography, returning to Vietnam  in 1949 as a French army combat photographer in the [[First Indochina War]]. After discharge from the army when the war ended in 1954, Huet remained in Vietnam as a civilian photographer working for the French and [[United States|America]]n governments. He went on to work for [[United Press International]] (UPI), later transferring to AP in 1965, covering the Vietnam War.

==Photographic career==

Huet's photographs of the war were influential in moulding American public opinion. One of his most memorable series of photographs featured [[Private First Class|Pfc]] Thomas Cole, a young medic of the First Cavalry division, tending fellow soldiers despite his own injuries. The series of twelve photographs was published in the [[11 February]], [[1966]] edition of [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] magazine, with one of the haunting images featuring on the cover. In 1967 the [[Overseas Press Club]] awarded Huet the [[Robert Capa]] Gold Medal  for the "best published photographic reporting from abroad, requiring exceptional courage and enterprise".<ref>{{cite web| year = 2004| url =http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php| title =The Robert Capa Gold Medal| work =OPC Awards| publisher = Overseas Press Club of America| accessdate =2006-06-04}}</ref>

During the South Vietnamese invasion of [[Laos]] in 1971, Huet accompanied the commanding General Lam, along with three other [[Photojournalism|photojournalists]], on a helicopter reconnaissance of the battlefield. The helicopter was shot down over the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] with the presumed loss of all those on board. Huet's fellow photographers were [[Larry Burrows]] of LIFE magazine, [[Kent Potter]] of UPI and [[Keizaburo Shimamoto]], a freelance photographer working for [[Newsweek]]. In 1998, an American led search team excavated the mountainside where the helicopter was thought to have been lost, finding small aircraft parts, two military helmets, and several pieces of [[35 mm film]]. However, no human remains were found.<ref>{{cite news| last =Pyle| first =Richard| date = [[March 22]], [[1998]]| url =http://www.pownetwork.org/bios/h/hx08.htm| title =Laos 1971 Crash Scene Searched| publisher =Associated press| accessdate =2006-06-04}}</ref>

Amongst his colleagues covering the war, Huet was respected for his dedication, bravery and skill in the field, and he was loved for his sense of humor and kindness. [[Dirck Halstead]], the Bureau Chief of United Press International in 1965, remarked that he "always had a smile on his face".<ref>{{cite web| last =Halstead| first =Dirck| year = 1997| month = November| url =http://digitaljournalist.org/issue9711/editrequiem9711.htm| title =Requiem| publisher = Digital Journalist| accessdate =2006-06-04}}</ref>
