"'''Animal'''" is a song performed by Swedish [[indie pop]] band [[Miike Snow]]. It was released as the first single from the band's 2009 [[Miike Snow (album)|self-titled debut album]] on 17 February 2009 through [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Downtown Records]]. Written by the band alongside [[Henrik Jonback]], "Animal" is a [[pop music|pop]] song with instrumentation provided by horns and [[staccato]] synthesizers. Lead singer [[Andrew Wyatt]] has explained that it has an ambiguous meaning; its lyrics can be interpreted as dealing with matters such as addiction, basic instincts or dissatisfaction when one's needs are not met by society.

Applauding its [[catchiness]] and pop sound, critics were positive towards "Animal". Following its release in the United Kingdom, the single managed to peak at number 98 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], but failed to chart elsewhere. Two [[music video]]s were made to promote the release of "Animal"; the first was directed by Sebastian Mlynarski and depicts the band wearing different animal masks, and the second video, directed by Anthony Dickenson, features a mixture of projections, animation and performance footage.

==Background==
"Animal" was written by [[Miike Snow]]'s three members, [[Bloodshy and Avant|Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg]] and [[Andrew Wyatt]], in collaboration with [[Henrik Jonback]].<ref name="liner"/> In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'', Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts <U+2013> some of them are wonderful and some of them are very dangerous."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/09/24/need-know-miike-snow|title=Need To Know: Miike Snow|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|last=Fitzharris|first=Dustin|date=24 September 2009|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher=[[Here Media]]}}</ref> In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'', Wyatt deemed it a "very simple song" and elaborated on its subject matter, "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/live-talking-miike-snow|title=Live Talking <U+2013> Miike Snow|last=Zadeh|first=Joe|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=9 May 2013|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|publisher=John O'Rourke}}</ref> "Animal" was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref name="liner"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/style/ten-essentials/201203/miike-snow-interview-10-essentials|title=10 Essentials: Miike Snow|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]|date=28 March 2012|last=McKnight|first=Ren|accessdate=2 March 2013}}</ref> The band produced the track and then [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] it with Anders Hvenare.<ref name="liner"/>

==Critical reception==
"Animal" received a positive response from music critics. Natalie Kaye of [[Contactmusic.com]] described it as a "solid pop song", before adding that the "infectious" chorus is "irrefutably something you'll end up whistling in the shower".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/miike-snow-miike-snowx03x12x09|title=Miike Snow <U+2013> Miike Snow Album Review|last=Kaye|first=Natalie|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Similarly, Ian Wade of [[BBC Music]] commented that it "takes approximately one play for its catchiness to cluster bomb your memory bank",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/qnn8|title=Review of Miike Snow|publisher=[[BBC Music]].

Jordan Bimm of ''[[Now (magazine)|Now]]'' described "Animal" as "catchy and creative" and said that the horns and the "playful vocal hook" will appeal to listeners who enjoyed [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" (2003), a production of Miike Snow members Karlsson and Winnberg.<ref name="Bimm">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=170716|title=Miike Snow|work=[[Now (magazine)|Now]]|publisher=Now Communications|last=Bimm|first=Jordan|date=5 August 2009|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> Sam Richards of ''[[NME]]'' viewed "Animal" as an "impressive piece of sleight of hand" and compared its sound to that of The Police, "while remaining bearable".<ref name="Richards">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/10763|title=Album review: Miike Snow <U+2013> 'Miike Snow'|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|last=Richards|first=Sam|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref> Ben Hogwood of [[musicOMH]] said that it sounds like a "lost Police song given a new, vividly coloured change of clothes".<ref name="Hogwood"/> He felt that the lyrical vignettes and hooks seem "awkward" during the first listen, and "gloriously different the next".<ref name="Hogwood">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/miike-snow_1009.htm|title=Miike Snow <U+2013> Miike Snow|publisher=[[musicOMH]].
