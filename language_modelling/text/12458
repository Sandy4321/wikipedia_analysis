==Media==
*The town was the setting for the acclaimed 1995 ''[[X-Files]]'' episode "[[Humbug (The X-Files)|Humbug]]," which was nevertheless filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The episode is about sideshow performers but does not star any of the town's actual residents.

*The town figured prominently in the [[Dean Koontz]] book ''[[Twilight Eyes]]'' which featured a character who sought refuge in the circus community and came back to "Gibtown" with them as the travelling season drew to a close

*The town was the title character in the fictional first person lyric of "Gibsonton," released on The Babylon Minstrels' [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:wbfuxq95ldfe self-titled CD] in 1992. The song was written by the group's co-founder, Julian Raymond.

* Gibsonton is the 'inspiration' for a novel called Kaleidoscope by Darrell Wimberly, who has written other novels and non-fiction set in west Florida.
