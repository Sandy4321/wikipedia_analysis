The '''effects of Hurricane Georges in Louisiana''' included $30.1&nbsp;million in damages and three deaths. Forming out of a [[tropical wave]] over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Hurricane Georges|Georges]] attained a peak intensity of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h) on September&nbsp;20, 1998. Over the following several days, the storm tracked through the [[Greater Antilles]] and later entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] On September&nbsp;28, the [[SSHS#Category 2|Category 2 storm]] made landfall in Mississippi before dissipating on October&nbsp;1. Before landfall, about 500,000 residents in Louisiana evacuated from low-lying areas. The mayor of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] declared a [[state of emergency]] to allow federal assistance into the state. After nearly 1.5 million people were urged to evacuate coastal areas, officials described the evacuation as "probably the largest [...] we have ever achieved"<ref name="Quote"/>

Numerous homes located outside the [[levee]] system were flooded by the storm's [[storm surge]], and 85 fishing camps on the banks of [[Lake Pontchartrain]] were destroyed. An estimated 160,000 residences were left without power due to Georges and severe [[beach erosion]] took place due to the slow movement of the hurricane. Precipitation statewide peaked at 2.98&nbsp;in (75.69&nbsp;mm) in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]], and wind gusts reached 82&nbsp;mph (132&nbsp;km/h). In the wake of the hurricane, the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) opened 67 shelters throughout the state. An estimated $56&nbsp;million was provided in disaster funds to the state for damages from both [[Tropical Storm Frances (1998)|Tropical Storm Frances]] and Hurricanes Georges. Additionally, a total of $14,150,532 in paid losses was reported by FEMA, including funding sent to Puerto Rico and Mississippi.

[[File:Georges 1998 track.png|thumb|180px|left|Track of Hurricane Georges|alt=A map of a path across a portion of the Atlantic Ocean. The track starts near the Cape Verde Islands, and heads generally west-northwestward. South America is depicted on the lower-left side of the map.]]
Hurricane Georges began as a [[tropical wave]] that moved off the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an [[Low pressure area|area of low pressure]] two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September&nbsp;16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September&nbsp;20 with winds of 155&nbsp;mph (250&nbsp;km/h), just below [[SSHS#Category 5|Category 5 status]] on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="TCR"/>

Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the [[Greater Antilles]], causing over 600 fatalities, primarily in the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]]. By September&nbsp;25, Georges entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] as a [[SSHS#Category 2|Category 2 hurricane]]. The storm made landfall three days later near [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], with winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed to an eastward drift. Georges dissipated on October&nbsp;1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida.<ref name="TCR"/>

==Preparations==
[[Image:Georges1998rain.gif|thumb|300px|left|Total rainfall in the United States from Georges|alt=A map of rainfall in the southern United States. The heaviest rainfall is in southern Mississippi and Alabama and the Florida panhandle.]]
At 9:00&nbsp;am [[Central Daylight Time]] (CDT) on September&nbsp;25, the [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a hurricane watch for coastal regions of [[Louisiana]] east of [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]]. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning when the storm neared landfall. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Morgan City and [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana|Intracoastal City]]. When forecasts indicated a landfall east of the state, the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning. By September&nbsp;29, all [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] were discontinued.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=John L.

During September&nbsp;25<U+2013>26, large-scale evacuations took place in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near [[New Orleans]].<ref name="NCDC"/> More than 1.5&nbsp;million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city.

Approximately 500,000 people evacuated from [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson]] and [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans]] Parishes in advance of the hurricane. Elsewhere, about 31,000 others took refuge in shelters set up throughout the state. In Jefferson Parish, roughly 3,900 people evacuated to public shelters, while 20,000 temporarily moved to Orleans Parish, 14,000 of whom were located in the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. In [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]], about 15,000 residents evacuated and 2,300 took refuge in public shelters.<ref name="NCDC">{{cite web|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|year=1999|accessdate=April 22, 2009|title=NCDC Event Report: Louisiana Hurricane|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~323928}}</ref> [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]]'s 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate for the fourth time in a month. Due to the large-scale evacuations, 175 off-duty state troopers and 250 national guard troops were deployed to help speed up the process. Only two highways, [[U.S. Route 90 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 90]] and [[Interstate 10 in Louisiana|Interstate 10]] lead in and out of New Orleans; however, heavy rains from previous storms flooded parts of US 90, hindering preparation efforts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Associated Press|publisher=Highbeam Research|date=September 27, 1998|accessdate=May 17, 2009|title=Hurricane Georges heading toward Big Easy|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19529786.html}}</ref> Lt.

Compared to the record-breaking rainfall in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, Hurricane Georges produced relatively little precipitation in Louisiana, peaking at 2.98&nbsp;in (75.69&nbsp;mm) in [[Bogalusa, Louisiana|Bogalusa]].<ref name="TCR"/> The worst damages were confined to the southeastern portion of the state, concentrated in the [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines]] and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana|St. Bernard]] Parishes. A [[storm surge]] of 8.9&nbsp;ft (2.7&nbsp;m) was recorded in [[Gardene Bay]] before power at the recording station failed. Gale-force winds impacted most of the parish and gusts peaked at 82&nbsp;mph (132&nbsp;km/h). The combination of high winds and surge cut power to most of the area and flooded at least 50 homes, all of which were located outside the [[levee]] system.<ref name="NCDC"/> A lighthouse on one island was partially submerged in the Gulf of Mexico, nearly {{convert|1200|ft|m}} from land following severe beach erosion. Six-foot (1.8&nbsp;m) sand dunes on the islands were completely eroded by the storm, leaving boardwalks formerly situated atop the dunes suspended near the water's surface.<ref>{{cite web|author=United States Department of the Interior|publisher=Highbeam Research|date=October 6, 1998|accessdate=May 17, 2009|title=Hurricane Georges damages Chandeleur Islands|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53064239.html}}</ref>

In [[St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana|St. Tammany Parish]], the storm's effects were mainly limited to wind damage: gusts reached 48&nbsp;mph (77&nbsp;km/h), knocking down trees and power lines. A storm surge of 4.3&nbsp;ft (1.3&nbsp;m) flooded 20 homes in the parish. Winds in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] gusted up to 55&nbsp;mph (88&nbsp;km/h), causing minor roof damage and power outages. In [[Orleans Parish, Louisiana|Orleans Parish]], a storm surge of 5.81&nbsp;ft (1.77&nbsp;m) destroyed 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden pilings. Winds gusting up to 68&nbsp;mph (109&nbsp;km/h) left 80,000 residences without power in the parish. Throughout the state, a total of 160,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the hurricane.<ref name="NCDC"/> Georges is blamed for three indirect fatalities; two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggrviated by the stress of the evacuation, and another died as the result of a house fire sparked by an emergency candle that was tipped over. Damages from the storm totaled approximately $30.1&nbsp;million.<ref name="NCDC"/>
