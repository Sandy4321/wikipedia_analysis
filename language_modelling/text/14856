'''Holborn''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|h|<U+0259><U+028A>|b|<U+0259>r|n}} {{respell|HOH|b<U+0259>rn}})<!--not just a local pronunciation-->{{Ref label|a|a|none}} is an area of [[central London]] and also the name of the area's principal street, known as [[High Holborn]] between St. Giles's High Street and [[Gray's Inn Road]] (the junction being roughly where Holborn Bar<U+2014>the entrance to the [[City of London]]<U+2014>once was) and then [[Holborn Viaduct]] between [[Holborn Circus]] and Newgate Street.  Since boundary changes in 1994, the street runs along the boundary between the [[London Borough of Camden]] and the City of London; previously the boundary was less obvious in the area and crossed the street at Holborn Bar.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The area's first mention is in a charter of [[Westminster Abbey]], by [[Edgar the Peaceful|King Edgar]], dated to 959. This mentions "the old wooden church of St Andrew" ([[St Andrew, Holborn]]).<ref name=lethaby>{{cite book|last=Lethaby|first=William|authorlink=William Lethaby|title=London before the conquest|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1902|page=60}}</ref> The name Holborn may be derived from the [[Middle English]] "hol" for ''hollow'', and ''bourne'', a brook, referring to the [[River Fleet]] as it ran through a steep valley to the east.<ref name=lethaby/><ref name=besant>{{cite book|last=Besant|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Besant|coauthors=Mitton, Geraldine|title=Holborn and Bloomsbury|publisher=[[A & C Black|Adam and Charles Black]]|location=London|year=1903|edition=Project Gutenberg, 2007|series=The Fascination of London|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21411/21411-8.txt|accessdate=13 August 2008}}</ref> Historical cartographer [[William Robert Shepherd|William Shepherd]] in his ''[[:File:Plan of London in 1300.jpg|Plan of London about 1300]]'' labels the Fleet as "Hole Bourn"  where it passes to the east of St Andrew's church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shepherd|first=William R|title=Historical atlas|publisher=University of London|year=1926|edition=3|page=75|oclc=253088196|url=http://lib.utexas.edu/maps/historical/shepherd/london_plan_1300.jpg}}</ref>  However, the 16th century historian [[John Stow]] attributes the name to the ''Old Bourne'' ("old brook"), a small stream which he believed ran into the Fleet at Holborn Bridge, a structure lost when the river was [[culvert]]ed in 1732. The exact course of the stream is uncertain, but according to Stow it started in one of the many small springs near Holborn Bar, the old [[City of London|City]] toll gate on the summit of Holborn Hill.<ref name=besant/><ref>{{cite book|last=Strype|first=John|authorlink=John Strype|title=Survey of London|publisher=Online edition: University of Sheffield 2007|year=1720|series=The Stuart London Project|chapter=Rivers and other Waters serving this City|url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/strype/TransformServlet?page=book1_024&display=print}}</ref> This is supported by a map of London and Westminster created during the reign of Henry VIII that clearly marks the street as 'Oldbourne' and 'High Oldbourne'. <ref> http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/oldenmappages/olden08a.html </ref> Other historians, however, find the theory implausible, in view of the slope of the land.<ref>Lethaby (1902:48)</ref>

===Local governance===
It was then outside the City's jurisdiction and a part of [[Ossulstone]] Hundred in [[Middlesex]]. In the 12th century St Andrew's was noted in local title deeds as lying on "Holburnestrate"<U+2014>Holborn Street.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harben|first=Henry|title=A Dictionary of London|publisher=Herbert Jenkins|location=London|year=1918}}</ref> The original Bars were the boundary of the [[City of London]] from 1223, when the City's jurisdiction was extended beyond the Walls, at Newgate, into the suburb here, as far as the point where the Bars where erected, until 1994 when the border moved to the junction of Chancery Lane. In 1394 the [[Ward (country subdivision)|Ward]] of [[Farringdon]] Without was created,  but only the south side of Holborn was under its jurisdiction with some minor properties, such as parts of Furnival's Inn, on the northern side, "above Bars". The rest of the area "below Bars" (outside the City's jurisdiction) was organised by the [[Vestry|vestry board]] of the parish of [[St Andrew Holborn|St Andrew]].<ref>''The Parish of St Andrew Holborn'' pp11-12 Caroline Barron London 1979</ref>

The [[Holborn District (Metropolis)|Holborn District]] was created in 1855, consisting of the civil parishes and extra-parochial places of [[Glasshouse Yard]], [[Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Ely Rents and Ely Place]], [[St Andrew Holborn Above the Bars with St George the Martyr]] and [[St Sepulchre (parish)|St Sepulchre]]. The [[Metropolitan Borough of Holborn]] was created in 1900, consisting of the former area of the Holborn District and the [[St Giles District (Metropolis)|St Giles District]], excluding Glasshouse Yard and St Sepulchre, which went to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]]. The Metropolitan Borough of Holborn was abolished in 1965 and its area now forms part of the [[London Borough of Camden]].

Local politicians include the Rt. Hon. [[Frank Dobson]] MP, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Holborn and St Pancras]], and three ward [[councillors]] for [[Holborn and Covent Garden]]: Cllr Julian Fulbrook, Cllr Sue Vincent and Cllr Awale Olad also of the Labour Party.

===Urban development===
[[Image:Staple Inn ca 1900.jpg|thumb|"[[Old Holborn]]": Staple Inn in 1900]]
In the 18th century, Holborn was the location of the infamous [[Mother Clap]]'s [[molly house]] but in the modern era [[High Holborn]] has become a centre for entertainment venues to suit more general tastes: 22 inns or taverns were recorded in the 1860s and the [[Holborn Empire]], originally [[Weston's Music Hall]], stood between 1857 and 1960, when it was pulled down after structural damage sustained in [[the Blitz]]. The theatre premi<U+00E8>red the first full-length feature film in 1914, ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1914 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'', a 50-minute [[melodrama]] filmed in [[Kinemacolour]].<ref>{{IMDb title|title=The World, the Flesh and the Devil|id=0004837}}</ref>

[[Charles Dickens]] took up residence in [[Furnival's Inn]], on the site of the former [[Prudential plc|Prudential]] building designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] now named "Holborn Bars". Dickens put his character "Pip", in ''[[Great Expectations]]'', in residence at [[Barnard's Inn]] opposite, now occupied by [[Gresham College]].<ref>Chap. 20</ref> [[Staple Inn]], notable as the promotional image for [[Old Holborn|Old Holborn tobacco]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hibbert|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Hibbert|last2=et al|first2=|title=The London Encyclopedia|edition=2010|year=1983|publisher=MacMillan |location=London|isbn=1-4050-4925-1|page=397}}</ref> is nearby. The three of these were [[Inns of Chancery]]. The most northerly of the [[Inns of Court]], [[Gray's Inn]], is in Holborn, as is [[Lincoln's Inn]]: the area has been associated with the legal professions since mediaeval times, and the name of the local militia (now [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit, the [[Inns of Court & City Yeomanry]]) still reflects that. Subsequently the area diversified and become recognisable as the modern street.  A plaque stands at number 120 commemorating [[Thomas Earnshaw]]'s invention of the [[Marine chronometer]], which facilitated long-distance travel. At the corner of Hatton Garden was the old family department store of [[Gamages]]. Until 1992, the London Weather Centre was located in the street.  The Prudential insurance company relocated in 2002. The [[Daily Mirror]] offices used to be directly opposite it, but the site is now occupied by [[Sainsbury's]] head office.

==Modern times==
Further east, in the gated avenue of [[Ely Place]], is [[St Etheldreda's Church]], originally the chapel of the [[Bishop of Ely]]<U+2019>s London palace. This ecclesiastical connection allowed the street to remain part of the county of [[Cambridgeshire]] until the mid 1930s. This meant that the Mitre Tavern, located in a court hidden behind the buildings of the Place and the Garden was subject to the Cambridgeshire Magistrates to grant its licence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/726471/Things-that-go-bump-on-the-map.html|title=Things that go bump on the map|last=Vitaliev|first=Vitali |authorlink=Vitali Vitaliev|date=3 January 2003|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/bars/features/1614.html|title=Secret London: Ye Olde Mitre Tavern|last=Hammond|first=Derek|date=28 June 2006|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]|accessdate=12 August 2008}}</ref>  St Etheldreda's is the oldest church building used for Roman Catholic worship in London, but this became so only after it ceased to be an Anglican chapel in the 19th century.

[[Hatton Garden]], the centre of the diamond trade, was leased to a favourite of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Sir Christopher Hatton at the insistence of the Queen to provide him with an income. Behind the Prudential Building lies the Anglo-Catholic church of St Alban the Martyr.<ref>[http://www.stalbans-holborn.com/ St Alban the Martyr] accessed 17 May 2007</ref>  Originally built in 1863 by architect William Butterfield it was destroyed in 1941 and a new church was built in the Victorian Gothic style. The current vicar is the Venerable Howard Levett.<ref>[http://www.stalbans-holborn.com/ The Parish Church of St Alban the Martyr, Holborn, stalbans-holborncom]</ref> On the southern side lie [[Chancery Lane]] and [[Fetter Lane]].

On [[Holborn Circus]] lies the Church of [[St Andrew, Holborn|St Andrew]], an ancient [[Guild]] Church that survived the [[Great Fire of London]].  However the parochial authority decided to commission [[Sir Christopher Wren]] to rebuild it.  Although the nave was destroyed in the Blitz, the reconstruction was faithful to Wren's original.  In the middle of the Circus there is a large equestrian statue of [[Prince Albert]] by Charles Bacon (1874), the City's official monument to him. It was presented by Charles Oppenheim, of the Diamond Trading Company [[De Beers]], whose headquarters building is in nearby Charterhouse Street.
[[File:Renaissance Chancery Court Hotel1.jpg|thumb|right|Former Pearl Assurance building]]
In the early 21st century, Holborn has become the site of new offices and hotels: for example, the old neoclassical Pearl Assurance building near the junction with [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] was converted into an hotel in 1999.

==Notes==
*'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}}Pronunciation: The authoritative BBC pronunciation unit recommends "[[IPA chart for English dialects|<U+02C8>h<U+0259><U+028A>b<U+0259>(r)n]]", but allowing "sometimes also '''hohl'''-buhrn".
