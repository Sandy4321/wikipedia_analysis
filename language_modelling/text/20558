On the [[track running|track]], Radcliffe won the 10,000 metres silver medal at the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics|1999 World Championships]] and was the [[Athletics at the 2002 Commonwealth Games|2002 Commonwealth champion]] at [[5000 metres]].

She has also been nominated for World Sportswoman of the year on several occasions. In 2010, she was inducted into the [[England Athletics Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Radcliffe was born on 17 December 1973 in [[Davenham]] near [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]]. Her family then moved to nearby [[Barnton, Cheshire|Barnton]] where she attended Little Leigh Primary School.<ref>[http://iccheshireonline.icnetwork.co.uk/0200sport/commonwealthgames/tm_headline=new-girl-on-the-block&method=full&objectid=12079373&siteid=50020-name_page.html]
icCheshireOnline, accessed 21/11/07</ref> Despite suffering from [[asthma]] and [[anaemia]] she took up running at the age of seven, influenced by her father who was a keen amateur [[marathon]] runner and joined [[Frodsham]] Athletic Club. Her family later moved to [[Kingsley, Cheshire|Kingsley]].

When Radcliffe was aged 12, the family moved to [[Oakley, Bedfordshire]] and she became a member of Bedford & County Athletics Club. Her joining the club coincided with a talented and dedicated coach, Alex Stanton, building the women's and girls' sections into one of the strongest in the country, in spite of [[Bedford]]'s relatively small size.

Radcliffe's father became club vice-chairman and her mother, a fun-runner, managed the women's cross-country team.<ref name="historic Rad"/> Her first race at a national level came as a 12-year-old in 1986 when she placed 299th out of around 600 in the girls' race of the English Schools Cross Country Championships. She finished fourth in the same race one year later.

Radcliffe attended [[Sharnbrook Upper School and Community College]]. She went on to study French, German and [[economics]] at [[Loughborough University]], gaining a first-class honours degree in modern European studies.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/sport/2003/04/radcliffe.shtml Paula's winning streak takes time...] BBC, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

Radcliffe's father was a keen marathon runner as a young man.

====Cross country champion====
On 24 March, Radcliffe won the [[Ostend]], Belgium held [[World Cross Country Championships]] 2001 title. Radcliffe, who finished in a time of 27:49, said: "It still hasn't really sunk in". [[Gete Wami]], who came in second place said: "No one likes losing, but if anyone deserves to win this title it is Paula. She was great."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/1240037.stm Radcliffe takes World Cross-Country title] BBC, 24 March 2001</ref>

===Marathon world record===
In 2002, Radcliffe made the move up to the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], a decision that immediately paid off with victory at her debut in that year's [[London Marathon]] on 14 April 2002 in a world's best time for a women's only race (2:18:55).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/specials/london_marathon_2002/1929069.stm Debut win for Radcliffe] [[BBC]], accessed 06/11/07</ref> Her time was the second quickest in women's marathon history behind the world record of 2:18:47 set by [[Catherine Ndereba]], of [[Kenya]], in Chicago.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/specials/london_marathon_2002/1929069.stm Debut win for Radcliffe] BBC, 14 April 2002</ref>

She was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] in June 2002. She said: "It means a great deal to me, it's a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year. To come here and receive this and to meet the Queen at the end of it just finishes it off perfectly."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/2405349.stm | title=Another medal for Radcliffe | publisher=BBC | accessdate=6 November 2007}}</ref>

Later the same year, she became the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]], making her the first woman in over a decade to be honoured with the accolade. Paula thanked her husband Gary Lough, her coach Alex Stanton and her physio, Gerard Hartmann.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/12_december/08/paula_radcliffe.shtml Paula Radcliffe is BBC Sports Personality of 2002] BBC, accessed 06/11/07</ref>

===Further world records===
Radcliffe is the current world record holder for the women's marathon, which she set during the 2003 [[London Marathon]] in April, with a time of 2:15:25. The performance is one of the highest of score's values in terms of the IAAF World ranking points.

Radcliffe is also the current world record holder for the women's road 10k in a time of 30 minutes and 21 seconds, which she set on 23 February 2003  in the [[World's Best 10K]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_2794000/2794749.stm  Paula Radcliffe breaks 10K world record] BBC Newsround, 24 February 2003</ref>

Radcliffe won the 2004 [[New York City Marathon]] in a time of 2:23:10, beating [[Kenya]]'s [[Susan Chepkemei]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/3990701.stm Radcliffe enjoys winning comeback] BBC, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

Of the seven marathons Radcliffe has run so far, she has won six and set a record in five. She has run four out of the five fastest times in history in the women's marathon.

===2004 Athens Olympics===
Radcliffe did not compete in the London Marathon in 2004, but was the favourite to win a gold medal in the marathon at the [[2004 Olympic Games|Olympic Games in Athens]]. However, she suffered an injury to her leg just two weeks prior to the event and had to use a high dose of anti-inflammatory drugs. This had an adverse effect on her [[stomach]], hindering food absorption. She ended up withdrawing from the race after {{convert|36|km|0|abbr=on}}. Five days later she started in the 10,000 metres but, still suffering from the effects of the marathon, retired with eight laps remaining.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/athletics/3589138.stm Marathon Agony for Radcliffe] BBC, accessed 08/11/07</ref> Radcliffe said "You go through bad stages in a marathon, but never as bad as that", "I've never before not been able to finish and I'm desperately trying to find a reason for what happened", "I just feel numb - this is something I worked so hard for."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/3590166.stm Radcliffe baffled by failure] BBC, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

Regarded as Great Britain's best gold medal hope in athletics, her withdrawal made headlines in the UK, with editorial stances ranging from support to negativity, with some newspapers deriding Radcliffe for 'quitting', rather than going on to finish the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?sf=621&set_id=6&click_id=621&art_id=qw1093677488214B243|title=World-record holder fails to finish again|author=Independent Newspapers Online|work=Independent Online}}</ref> Television pictures showed Radcliffe in a clearly distressed state after dropping out of the marathon, being comforted by two friends from her early running days.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/athletics/3606762.stm Fans share Paula's pain] BBC, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

===2005: Marathon World Champion===
[[File:Paula Radcliffe London marathon 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Paula Radcliffe leading the [[London Marathon]] in 2005, near to [[Limehouse]] in east London.]]
At the 2005 London Marathon, Radcliffe won with a time of 2:17:42, a world's best time for a women's only race by over a minute. The race is remembered for a notorious moment towards the end when Radcliffe, hindered by [[runner's diarrhoea]] and in need for a toilet break, stopped and [[defecated]] on the side of the road in view of the crowd and TV cameras which broadcast the incident live.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=409552005| title=Relief all round after Paula pauses on road to glory| date=18 April 2005| publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]''| location=Edinburgh| first=John| last=Innes}}</ref> After the race, she apologised to viewers and explained what happened, "I was losing time because I was having stomach cramps and I thought 'I just need to go and I'll be fine'.

On 14 August 2005 at the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] held in [[Helsinki]] she won Britain's only gold medal when she took the marathon title, dominating the race and setting a championship record time of 2:20:57. [[Catherine Ndereba]] of Kenya finished in second place, more than a minute behind. Radcliffe said: "It pretty much went according to plan. If somebody had been with me at the end I think I could have pushed it up a bit more." She and three other British runners were also awarded third place in the team competition.<ref>[http://www.sportinglife.com/athletics/worldathletics2005/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=others/05/08/14/manual_112330.html  Marathon Glory for Radcliffe] Sporting Life, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

===Family and autobiography===
[[File:Paula & Isla Radcliffe 2007 NYC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Paula Radcliffe with daughter Isla at the New York City Marathon, 2007]]
Radcliffe took a break through the 2006 season owing to injuries and in July announced that she was expecting her first child. Her comeback was further delayed in 2007 as a result of a stress fracture in her lower back.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/athletics/article1733835.ece Radcliffe may miss World Championships] Times, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

Radcliffe chose not to defend her world marathon crown in 2007, in order to undertake further rehabilitation, but insisted she wanted to compete in the next two Olympics. She made her return to competitive running on 30 September 2007, taking part in the BUPA [[Great North Run]] in the UK on [[Tyneside]]. This was her first race in almost two years. Radcliffe finished second behind US runner [[Kara Goucher]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/content/image_galleries/gnr07_finish_elite_gallery.shtml?5 Great North Run 2007] BBC Tyne, accessed 08/11/07</ref>

Radcliffe withdrew from the 2008 [[London Marathon]] due to a foot injury.<ref>[http://coachjoeenglish.wordpress.com/2008/03/06/races-paula-radcliffe-withdraws-from-2008-london-marathon/ Races: Paula Radcliffe withdraws from 2008 London Marathon <U+00AB> Running Advice and News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Shortly after the London Marathon, it was also revealed that Radcliffe was suffering from an injury to her hip, preventing her from running. Originally thought to be a muscular problem, scans later revealed it was a [[Bone fracture|stress fracture]] to her [[femur]]. In May, Radcliffe broke her left leg.

Radcliffe managed to get to fitness level for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but cramped during the marathon to the point where she had to stop running and stretch. She resumed the race and finished in 23rd place overall.

Radcliffe won the 2008 [[New York City Marathon]], making it her third victory at the competition with a time of 2:23:56. Russian [[Lyudmila Petrova]] came in second, and American [[Kara Goucher]] took third.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/sports/othersports/03women.html?ref=othersports|title=Radcliffe Reasserts Her Supremacy|date=2 November 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-11-04 | first=Jer<U+00E9> | last=Longman}}</ref>

Following the New York Marathon, Radcliffe suffered more injury setbacks: she had to withdraw from the [[2009 London Marathon]] due to a fractured toe.

Following a 19-month layoff that included the birth of her second child, she returned to action at the Bupa London {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, where she finished 3rd, 55 seconds behind the winner, [[Jo Pavey]].

==Anti-doping==
Radcliffe has frequently made high-profile condemnations of the [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|use of performance-enhancing drugs]] in athletics. Radcliffe and team-mate [[Hayley Tullett]] caused controversy when in the heats of the 5,000 metres at the 2001 the World Athletics Championships in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]; when they held up a sign protesting against the reinstatement of Russian athlete [[Olga Yegorova]] after Yegorova had tested positive for the banned substance [[Erythropoietin|EPO]]. The sign was made by Radcliffe's husband and read 'EPO Cheats Out.' It was eventually taken off them by the stadium officials, but not before it was streamed around the world.<ref name="2001 ED"/>  After Radcliffe and Tullett's initial protest, team mates [[Kathy Butler]] and [[Hayley Yelling]] - who both missed out on a place in the final - protested alongside coaches [[Mark Rowland]] and [[Alan Storey]], wearing Radcliffe masks and holding up banners with mocking slogans including one which read 'Free Paula.'<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/world_athletics/1485647.stm | work=BBC News | title=Yegorova booed to 5,000m 'glory' | date=11 August 2001}}</ref> Radcliffe vowed to continue her fight against drugs in sport after her high profile actions in Edmonton.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/world_athletics/1488232.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radcliffe vows to continue campaign | date=13 August 2001}}</ref> Since the 1999 European Cup, Radcliffe wears a red ribbon when competing to show her support for blood testing as a method of catching drugs cheats.<ref name="2001 ED">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/world_athletics/1483621.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radcliffe makes placard protest | date=9 August 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/19/sports/track-and-field-once-again-suspicion-settles-into-the-blocks.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=TRACK AND FIELD; Once Again, Suspicion Settles Into the Blocks | date=19 August 1999}}</ref>

Radcliffe has advocated a system where first time offenders are banned for four years and any future offense for life. However she felt that in cases like that of [[Christine Ohuruogu]], who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/5399726.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radcliffe keen for doping changes | date=2 October 2006}}</ref> However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not trying to get to the tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/7128340.stm | work=BBC News | title=Radcliffe concern over Ohuruogu | date=5 December 2007}}</ref> When [[Marion Jones]] admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.<ref name="Jones">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/7031132.stm | work=BBC News | title=IAAF chief blasts 'fraud' Jones | date=6 October 2007}}</ref>

Reflecting upon the scepticism created by incidents of doping, she said "You have to accept the situation...it would be great if we could win the battle against doping and have testing that was 100 per-cent reliable, but I don't think that will happen in my competitive career." She has previously asked for the results of her [[blood test]]s to be made public, saying that she had "absolutely no objection to my test being released".<ref>Rowbottom, Mike (2002-08-08).
