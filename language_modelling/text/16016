'''''Bothrops asper''''' is a [[venomous snake|venomous]] [[Crotalinae|pitviper]] [[species]] found in [[Central America|Central]] and northern [[South America]].<ref name="McD99"/> No subspecies are currently recognized.<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS|ID=585769|taxon=Bothrops asper|year=2006|date=6 November}}</ref>

==Description==
These are among the most [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] snakes. The two sexes are born the same size, but at the age of 7 to 12 months, females begin to grow faster than males. Males never reach 1.95 m long, while females average perhaps 1.85 m, and the greatest confirmed length is 2.5 m.  Females have thick bodies, and big females may weigh 6 kg; heavier ones have been reported. Thus female terciopelos are among the heaviest venomous snakes. They also have heads two or three times as big as males in proportion to their size, and proportionally bigger fangs (typically 2.5 cm) as well.<ref name="VRO">[http://www.venomousreptiles.org/articles/133 Captive care of ''B. asper''] at [http://www.venomousreptiles.org/ VenomousReptiles.org]. Accessed 6 November 2006.</ref>

The color pattern resembles that of ''[[Bothrops atrox|B. atrox]]'': diagonal stripes and diamonds of various shades of brown.  The underside of the head is pale yellowish. Newborn snakes are brighter in color and males have yellow tail tips.

==Common names==
Terciopelo, fer-de-lance, barba amarilla (Guatemala), yellow-jaw tommygoff ([[Belize]]) mapepire (pronounced ''ma-pay-pee'') balsain ([[Trinidad]])<ref>''Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad & Tobago Dictionary'', p. 75. John Mendes. (1986) Arima, Trinidad.</ref> The name fer-de-lance is commonly used in North America to refer to this species, as well as to ''[[Bothrops atrox|B. atrox]]'', despite the fact that the name has no legitimate origin and is not used in countries inhabited by this species.<ref name="C&L04"/>

The name terciopelo means [[velvet]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name="">[http://www.e-spanyol.hu/en/vocabulary/words_clothes.php Clothes] at [http://www.e-spanyol.hu/en/ Online resources for Spanish language learning]. Accessed [[3 February]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Geographic range==
Found in the Atlantic lowlands of eastern [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]], including [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]]. A disjunct population occurs in southeastern [[Chiapas]] (Mexico) and southwestern [[Guatemala]]. In northern [[South America]] it is found in [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] given is "Obispo, on the [[Isthmus of Darien]]" (Panama).<ref name="McD99"/>

Another source describes the range as northwestern Mexico southward to Ecuador, including Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and its presence is questionable in Venezuela. It is also said that the species can be very common.<ref name="VRO"/>

==Habitat==
It chiefly inhabits tropical rainforest and evergreen forest, but it also occurs in drier areas of tropical deciduous forest, thorn forest and pine savannah near lakes, rivers and streams.

==Behavior==
This species is mostly nocturnal, hiding in leaf litter or among roots during the day. They can strike from a coiled or uncoiled position. They usually flee from danger, but may turn abruptly and strike. During a strike, they may aim past their target to the side and quickly bring their head around to bite from behind.<ref name="VRO"/>

==Reproduction==
Males generally stop eating for a time after the beginning of the reproductive cycle, while females stop after a few months of pregnancy. Mating occurs at different times of year in different areas.  Gestation is typically 180 to 240 days, and young are [[Ovoviviparity|born alive]]. The average litter is about 30, but litters up to 80 or 100 have been reported. Females need extra food after giving birth. Neonates use their tail tips to lure prey (caudal luring).<ref name="VRO"/>

==Venom==
[[Image:Tissue necrosis following bite from Bothrops asper PLoS Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|Tissue necrosis following a bite from ''B. asper''.]] This species is an important cause of snakebite within its range. Together with ''[[Crotalus durissus]]'' it is the leading cause of snakebite in [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]], [[Mexico]]. It is considered the most dangerous snake in [[Costa Rica]], responsible for 46% of all bites and 30% of all hospitalized cases; before 1947 the fatality rate was 7%, but this has since declined to almost 0% (Bola<U+00F1>os, 1984). In the [[Colombia]]n states of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and [[Choc<U+00F3> Department|Choc<U+00F3>]] it causes 50-70% of all snakebites with a [[sequelae]] rate of 6% and a fatality rate of 5% (Otero et al., 1992). In the state of [[Lara (state)|Lara]], [[Venezuela]], it is responsible for 78% of all envenomations and all snakebite fatalities (Dao-L., 1971). One of the reasons so many people are bitten is because of its association with human habitation and many bites actually occur indoors (Sasa & V<U+00E1>zquez, 2003). Well-known [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] Douglas March died after being bitten by this species.<ref name="War-C&L04">Warrell DA. 2004. Snakebites in Central and South America: Epidemiology, Clinical Features, and Clinical Management. ''In'' Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. ISBN 0-8014-4141-2.</ref>

This species is irritable, fast-moving and agile. It is also regarded as being more excitable and unpredictable than ''[[Bothrops atrox|B. atrox]]'', and has a reputation for being aggressive. Its large size and habit of raising its head high off the ground can result in bites above the knee. It has also been observed to eject venom over a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8&nbsp;m) in fine jets from the tips of its fangs (Mole, 1924).<ref name="War-C&L04"/>

Bite symptoms include pain, oozing from the puncture wounds, local swelling that may increase for up to 36 hours, bruising that spreads from the bite site, blisters, numbness, mild fever, headache, bleeding from the nose and gums, [[hemoptysis]], gastrointestinal bleeding, [[hematuria]], [[hypotension]], nausea, vomiting, impaired consciousness and tenderness of the [[spleen]]. In untreated cases, local necrosis frequently occurs and may require amputation. In 12 fatal cases the cause of death was [[septicemia]] (5), intercranial hemorrhage (3), [[acute renal failure]] with [[hyperkalemia]] and metabolic acidosis (2) and hemorrhagic shock (1).<ref name="War-C&L04"/>

Venom yield (dry weight) averages 458 mg with a maximum of 1530 mg (Bola<U+00F1>os, 1984)<ref name="War-C&L04"/> and an [[LD50|LD<font size ="-1"><sub>50</sub></font>]] in mice of 2.844 mg/kg [[Peritoneum|IP]].<ref name="VRO"/>

==Taxonomy==
This species was formerly regarded as a subspecies of ''[[Bothrops atrox|B. atrox]]'' and is still often confused with it.<ref name="VRO"/>
