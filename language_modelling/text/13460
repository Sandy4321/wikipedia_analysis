'''Callahan Bright''' (born January 16, 1987) is an [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Wichita Wild]] of the [[Champions Professional Indoor Football League]]. A former [[high school football]] standout, his career derailed during college.<ref name="SI.com">{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/writers/andy_staples/02/24/bright/index.html |title=Former top recruit Callahan Bright seeks second chance in NFL |first=Andy |last=Staples |date=February 24, 2010 }}</ref> After one season at Division II [[Shaw University]], Bright entered the [[2010 NFL Draft]] but was not selected.

==Early life==
A native of [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], in the [[Delaware Valley]], Bright graduated from [[Welsh Valley Middle School]], and then attended [[Glen Mills Schools|Glen Mills School]] in [[Thornbury Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Thornbury]] for two years, a school for court-adjudicated youths. Bright said he was sent there because of <U+201C>behavioral problems.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |first=Rick |last=O'Brien |url=http://articles.philly.com/2004-09-02/sports/25377074_1_bright-plans-official-visits-rams |title=Rams' behemoth Callahan Bright a dominant force Harriton's two-way tackle is also fast and versatile, able to play guard or even fullback |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=September 2, 2004 }}</ref> As a junior, he transferred to [[Harriton High School]] in [[Rosemont, Pennsylvania]], where he was an All-American defensive lineman, while also playing [[lacrosse]] and wrestling in the unlimited division at several [[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]] tournaments.

Constantly drawing double- and triple-teams by opponents, Bright's dominance was noted by scouts. [[Tom Lemming]] of ''[[ESPN]]'' called him <U+201C>the most dominating high school defensive lineman [since [[Shaun Cody]]].<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/news/story?id=1867377 |title=Future's Bright for Pennsylvania DL |work=[[ESPN Insider]] |date=August 25, 2004 |first=Tom |last=Lemming }}</ref> At the Elite College Combine in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], Bright dominated in one-on-one drills against the likes of [[Eugene Monroe]].<ref name="SI.com" /> <U+201C>He was so powerful. He always had great leverage and got under taller players, and he had one of the best bull rushes I've ever seen,<U+201D> said ''[[Rivals.com]]'' analyst Mike Farrell.<ref name="SI.com" />  Although initially invited to the [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]], he could not participate due to a suspension that also caused him to miss his final high school game.<ref name="SI.com" />

Regarded as a five-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Bright was listed as the No. 2 defensive tackle prospect of a class that also included [[Jerrell Powe]], [[Ndamukong Suh]], and [[Dan Williams (defensive tackle)|Dan Williams]].<ref>http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/rankings/rank-879</ref> Only [[DeMarcus Granger]] of [[Justin F. Kimball High School|Kimball High School]] in [[Dallas]] was ranked in front of him. Recruited by dozens of schools, Bright narrowed his choices down to [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]], [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]]<U+2014>where his older brother [[Eugene Bright|Eugene]] played defensive end<U+2014>and [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]]. He only took two official visits, to Florida State and Texas A&M, in December 2004.<ref>http://recruiting.scout.com/a.z?s=73&p=8&c=1&nid=1205262</ref> During [[National Signing Day]], Bright committed to Florida State on ''[[ESPN News]]''.<ref name="Pompey2010">{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/2010-04-22/sports/24959183_1_nfl-dream-higher-level-callahan-bright |title=Harriton's Bright hopes for shot at NFL draft |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=April 22, 2010 |first=Keith |last=Pompey }}</ref> Alongside wide receiver prospect [[Fred Rouse]], Bright was considered to be the cornerstone of the [[2005 Florida State Seminoles football team#Recruits|Seminoles' 2005 recruiting class]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1336343 |title=The Unlucky 13: Top classes that fizzled |work=Rivals.com |date=February 27, 2012 |first=Steve |last=Megargee }}</ref>

==College career==
Apart from his official visit, Bright never stepped onto FSU campus in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name="Pompey2010" /> Because of his 2.5 core grade point average, he needed to get at least an 820 on the [[SAT]] to meet the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] minimum eligibility standards, which he did not. Ineligible for college football, Bright briefly attended [[Hargrave Military Academy]], but could not improve his academics. Opting for the junior college route, he enrolled at [[Butler Community College]] in [[El Dorado, Kansas]], to play football.

The birth of his son, in 2007, altered his career, causing him to take a job as a garbage man in [[Radnor Township, Pennsylvania]], so he could also take night classes at [[Delaware County Community College]].<ref name="SI.com" /> In July 2007, Bright was arrested in the delivery of [[marijuana]] to a police informant. Charged with a felony count of possession with the intent to deliver, Bright pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served and two years' probation.<ref name="Narducci2011" />

Bright eventually wound up at [[Shaw University]] located in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. He spent two years on the scout team before regaining his academic eligibility in 2009. That year he registered 48 tackles, 7.5 tackles for a loss and half a sack, which earning him selection to the CIAA All-Rookie team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ibcsports.com/sportsday/2009/11069/shaw-fb-11059.htm |title=Shaw<U+2019>s Callahan Bright Named to CIAA All-Rookie Team |work=IBCsports.com |date=November 5, 2009 }}</ref> He then decided to bypass his senior year and to enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]].<ref name="Narducci2011" />

==Professional career==

===2010 NFL Draft===
After preparing for the draft at All-Star Sports Training in [[Paisley, Florida]],<ref name="SI.com" /> Bright was invited to participate at NC State<U+2019>s pro-day, where he demonstrated his raw strength with 41 reps at the bench press,<ref name="Draftinsider" /> which was only topped among 2010 draft prospects by [[Mitch Petrus]] (45). According to [[Mike Mayock]], there was <U+201C>some interest in him as a late-draftable/preferred free-agent type.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nfl.com/2010/03/27/ol-prospects-asamoah-saffold-show-promise/ |title=OL prospects Asamoah, Saffold show promise |work=NFL.com |date=March 27, 2010 }}</ref>

While seen as a <U+201C>prototypical nose guard for teams using the [[3<U+2013>4_defense|3<U+2013>4 defensive scheme]],<U+201D> Bright's background issues scared many teams off.<ref name="Pompey2010" /> He was not selected by any team in the draft.

===Arena Football League===

Playing in all seven of the Wild<U+2019>s remaining games last season, Bright tallied 33 total tackles, one and a half sacks and two forced fumbles.
