'''James Gordon Farrell''' (25 January 1935 <U+2013> 11 August 1979), known as '''J. G. Farrell''', was a [[Liverpool]]-born novelist of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. Farrell gained prominence  for his historical fiction, most notably his ''Empire Trilogy'' (''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'', ''[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]'' and ''[[The Singapore Grip (novel)|The Singapore Grip]]''), dealing with the political and human consequences of British [[colonialism|colonial]] rule. However, his career was cut tragically short when he drowned in Ireland at the age of 44.

''The Siege of Krishnapur'' won the 1973 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]]. On 19 May 2010, it was announced that ''Troubles'' had retrospectively won the [[Lost Man Booker Prize]], which was a prize created to recognise works published in 1970 (a group that had not previously been open for consideration due to a change in the eligibility rules at the time). 

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Farrell, born in Liverpool into a family of [[Anglo-Irish]] background, was the second of three brothers. His father, William Farrell, had worked as an accountant in Bengal and in 1929, he married Prudence Josephine Russell, who was a  former receptionist and secretary to a doctor.  From the age of 12 he attended [[Rossall School|Rossall]] public school in [[Lancashire]]. After World War II, the Farrells moved to [[Dublin]], and from this point on Farrell spent much time in [[Ireland]]: this, perhaps combined with the popularity of ''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'', leads many to treat him as an Irish writer. After leaving Rossall, he taught in Dublin and also worked for some time on [[Distant Early Warning Line]] in the Canadian Arctic. In 1956 he went to study at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]; while there he contracted [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. This would leave him partially crippled and disease would be prominent in his works. In 1960 he left Oxford with [[British undergraduate degree classification|Third-class honours]] French and Spanish and went to live in France, where he taught at a [[lyc<U+00E9>e]].<ref name= "Prusse 2003">{{cite book |last=Prusse|first=Michael C.|title=British and Irish Novelists Since 1960|year=2003 |publisher=Gale|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7876-6015-4}}</ref>

===Early works===
Farrell published his first novel, ''A Man From Elsewhere'', in 1963.  Set in France, it shows the clear influence of French existentialism. The story follows Sayer, who is a journalist for a communist paper, as he tries to find skeletons in Regan's closet. Regan is a dying novelist who is about to be awarded an important Catholic literary prize. The book mimics the fight between the two leaders of French existentialism: [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]] (Sayer representing Sartre and Regan representing Camus). The two argue about existentialism: the position that murder can be vindicated as an expedient in overthrowing tyranny (Sartre) versus the stance that there are no ends that justify unjust means (Camus). [[Bernard Bergonzi]] reviewed it in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' in the September 20, 1963 issue and said, "Many first novels are excessively autobiographical, but ''A Man from Elsewhere'' suffers from the opposite fault of being a cerebral construct, dreamed up out of literature and the contemporary French cinema." [[Simon Raven]] wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' on September 15, 1963 that "Mr. Farrell's style is spare, his plotting lucid and well timed; his expositions of moral or political problems are pungent if occasionally didactic." <ref name= "Prusse 2003"/> It entirely lacks the ironic humour and the tender appreciation of human frailty which characterise his later work.  Farrell himself came to dislike the book.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Two years after this came ''The Lung'', in which Farrell returned to his real-life trauma of less than a decade earlier: the main character Martin Sands contracts polio and has to spend a long period in hospital. It has been noted that it is somewhat modeled after Farrell, but it is modeled more after Geoffrey Firmin from [[Malcolm Lowry]] 1947 novel, ''[[Under the Volcano]]''.<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/> The anonymous reviewer for ''[[The Observer]]'' on October 31, 1965, wrote that "Mr. Farrell gives the pleasantly solid impression of really having something to write about" and one for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on November 11, 1965 that "Mr. Farrell's is an effective, potent brew, compounded of desperation and a certain wild hilarity." <ref name= "Prusse 2003"/>

In 1967 he published ''A Girl in the Head''. The protagonist, the impoverished Polish count Boris Slattery, lives in the fictional English seaside town of Maidenhair Bay, in the house of the Dongeon family (which is believed to be modeled after [[V. S. Naipaul]]'s ''[[A House for Mr Biswas]]''). His marriage to Flower Dongeon is decaying. His companion is Dr. Cohen, who is a dying alcoholic. Boris also has sex with an underaged teenager, June Furlough. He also fantasizes about Ines, a Swedish summer guest, who is the "girl in the head". Boris is believed to be modeled after Humbert Humbert in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]''.<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/> Like its two predecessors, the book met only middling critical and public reaction. In the July 13, 1967 issue of ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'', [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] wrote that he disliked the novel, and thought it was, at best, an "adroit pastiche" of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s deadbeats.<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/> Martin Levin wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' on March 23, 1969, that he praised the author's "flair for giving the ridiculous an inspired originality".<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/> In an anonymous review in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' on July 20, 1967, the writer stated that the "verbal assurance and resourcefulness show that Mr. Farrell is not content to coast along merely imitating his previous work. Such a deliberate extension of range is perhaps a hopeful sign for a talent which, after three novels, still has not found the mode in which to fulfil its attractive promise."<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/>

===Empire Trilogy===
''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'' tells the comic yet melancholy tale of an English Major, Brendan Archer, who in 1919 goes to [[County Waterford]] in Ireland to meet the woman he believes he may be engaged to marry.  From the crumbling Majestic Hotel at Kilnalough, he watches Ireland's fight for independence from Britain. Farrell started writing this book while on a [[Harkness Fellowship]] in the United States and finished it in a tiny flat in [[Knightsbridge]], [[London]]. He got the idea for the setting from going to [[Block Island]] and seeing the remains of an old burned-down hotel.<ref>{{cite book | title= J.G.

ISBN 0747544638 / 0-7475-4463-8</ref> He won a [[Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize]] for the novel, and with the prize money travelled to India to research his next novel.<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/>  

Farrell's next book ''[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]'' and his last completed work ''[[The Singapore Grip (novel)|The Singapore Grip]]'' both continue his story of the collapse of British colonial power. The former deals with the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Inspired by historical events such as the sieges of [[Cawnpore]] and [[Lucknow]], the novel is set in the fictional town of Krishnapur, where a besieged British garrison succeeds in holding out for four months against an army of native [[sepoys]], in the face of enormous suffering, before being relieved.

The third of the novels, [[The Singapore Grip]], centers upon the Japanese capture of the British colonial city of Singapore in 1942, while also exploring at some length the economics and ethics of colonialism at the time, as well as the economic relationship between developed and [[Third World]] countries at the time that Farrell was writing.

The three novels are in general linked only thematically, although Archer, a character in ''[[Troubles]]'', reappears in ''[[The Singapore Grip]]''. The protagonist of Farrell's unfinished novel, ''The Hill Station'', is Dr McNab, introduced in ''[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]''; this novel and its accompanying notes make the series a quartet.

When ''The Siege of Krishnapur'' won the [[Booker Prize]] in 1973, Farrell used his acceptance speech to attack the sponsors, the [[Booker Group]], for their business involvement in the agricultural sector in the Third World.<ref>[http://nyrb.typepad.com/classics/2008/05/the-best-of-the.html A Different Stripe: The Best of the Booker: The Siege of Krishnapur<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In this vein, some readers have found Farrell's critique of colonialism and capitalism in his subsequent novel ''The Singapore Grip'' to be heavy-handed, although those new to the book after the crash of 2008 might not find it so.

[[Charles Sturridge]] scripted a film version of ''[[Troubles]]''  made for British television in 1988 and directed by [[Christopher Morahan]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293963/ Troubles (1988) (TV)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Death===
In 1979 Farrell decided to quit London to take up residence on the [[Sheep's Head]] peninsula in southwestern Ireland.  A few months later he was found drowned on the coast of [[Bantry Bay]], apparently from falling in from rocks while angling.  He was 44. He is buried in the cemetery of St. James's Church of Ireland church in [[Durrus]].

The manuscript library at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] holds his papers: Papers of James Gordon Farrell (1935<U+2013>1979). TCD MSS 9128-60.

===Legacy===
Peter Morey wrote that "an interpretation of the novels of J. G. Farrell and [[Paul Mark Scott|Paul Scott]] as examples of [[Postcolonial literature|post-colonial fiction]] [is possible], since both partake of oppositional and interrogative narrative practices which recognize and work to dismantle the staple elements of imperial narrative." <ref name= "Prusse 2003"/>

Ronald Binns described Farrell's colonial novels as "probably the most ambitious literary project conceived and executed by any British novelist in the 1970s." <ref name= "Prusse 2003"/><ref>J.G. Farrell London and New York Methuen ISBN 0416403204</ref>

In the 1984 novel ''[[Foreign Affairs (novel)|Foreign Affairs]]'' by [[Alison Lurie]], Vinnie Miner, the protagonist, reads a Farrell novel on her flight from New York to London. In the 1991 novel ''The Gates of Ivory'' by [[Margaret Drabble]], the writer Stephen Cox is modeled after Farrell.<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/>

Farrell said to George Brock in an interview for [[The Observer|The Observer Magazine]], "the really interesting thing that's happened during my lifetime has been the decline of the British Empire."<ref name= "Prusse 2003"/><ref>The Observer Magazine September 24, 1978 ISSN 0029-7712</ref>
