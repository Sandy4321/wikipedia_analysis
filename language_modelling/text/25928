'''''The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek''''' (often shortened to '''''Anatomy''''' by fans) is the second full-length album released by the [[Christian rock]] band [[Relient K]]. It was released on August 28, 2001, and peaked at No.&nbsp;158 on the Billboard 200. On June 26, 2006, the album was certified [[gold album|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for sales in excess of 500,000 units in the United States. The cover of the original release is similar to that of the 1999 [[Ramones]] release ''[[Hey Ho! Let's Go: The Anthology]]''.

The album continues the band's liberal use of [[pop culture]] references (such as the song "I'm Lion-O," which is about the popular TV series ''[[Thundercats]]'').<ref name="Powell_Fe">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=[[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], [[Massachusetts]] |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |edition=First printing |pages=750<U+2013>751}}</ref> Song themes range from pop culture to Christian themes<U+2014>growth in [[faith]] ("Pressing On"), [[backsliding]] ("What Have You Been Doing Lately?"), [[Christian worship|worship]] ("Those Words Are Not Enough," "For the Moments I Feel Faint," and "Less Is More")<ref name="Powell_Fe"/><U+2014>and social themes<U+2014>such as [[racism]] and [[persecution]] ("Failure to Excommunicate"), [[Value judgment|judgementalism]] ("Down in Flames")<U+2014>to making [[excuse]]s or [[blame|blaming]] others for one's own faults ("Maybe It's Maybeline").<ref name="Powell_Fe"/> There is also a song about one's experiences in high school ("Sadie Hawkins Dance").

[[Gotee Records]] released a "Gold Edition" of this album on October 31, 2006 along with the release of a "Gold Edition" of ''[[Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do]]'' on the same day. The Gold Edition of this album has remixed and remastered sound is similar to ''[[Mmhmm]]'' (the album was remixed by the same people who mixed ''Mmmhmm'') and it has a music video for the song "[[Pressing On]]".

== References to popular culture ==
* The last line of "[[Pressing On]]" is from ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' theme.<ref name="Powell_Fe"/>
* "Maybe It's Maybeline" (deliberately misspelled, much like the band's name) refers to the popular [[Maybelline]] line of beauty products and its tag line.<ref name="Powell_Fe"/>
* The title of "Lion Wilson" is a play on [[Brian Wilson]]. "Lion Wilson" is the first of many Relient K songs to draw heavily from the style of Wilson and his band [[The Beach Boys]], both of which Relient K lead singer Matthew Thiessen often references as major influences on his music.
* "May the Horse Be with You" makes references to [[Mister Ed]] and [[Star Wars]].
* "Breakfast at Timpani's" is a play on ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.
* "I'm Lion-O" refers to the main character of the popular 1980s cartoon, ''[[ThunderCats]]''.
* The song title "Failure To Excommunicate" is a reference to the famous line from the film [[Cool Hand Luke]], "[[What we've got here is a failure to communicate]]."
* "Those Words Are Not Enough" is a reference to the 007 film [[The World Is Not Enough]].
* "The Rest is Up to You" features the same bass line as "Hit or Miss" by [[New Found Glory]], and pays homage by starting the verse with the lyric "I was just about to quote [[Mark Twain]]". The line is in reference to the title of New Found Glory's album ''[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (album)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]'', which features the song "[[Hit or Miss (Waited Too Long)]]".

== Notes and trivia ==
* The hidden track after "Less Is More" is entitled "[[Skittles and Combos]]." The band used to encourage fans to bring [[Skittles (confectionery)|Skittles]] and [[Combos]] to shows. While they no longer encourage it, fans still do, and often throw packages to the band. In addition, small packages of each are sometimes placed on the stage by the crew prior to performances. Thiessen also later on admitted that he despised Skittles and had no idea what Combos were.
* "Skittles and Combos" isn't on the gold re-release.  A different hidden track is at the end of "Less is More" called "The Ballad of Tim Eddings". Tim Eddings was originally the manager for Relient K, and also was a producer for [[Ace Troubleshooter]], the old band of current Relient K bassist [[John Warne]].
* The only original Relient K song that [[Matt Thiessen]] did not write (prior to the four other member-written songs on ''[[The Bird and the Bee Sides]]''), "Those Words Are Not Enough", is on this album. [[Matt Hoopes]] wrote the song.
* Both verses of the song "Failure to Excommunicate" are sung by drummer [[Dave Douglas (drummer)|Dave Douglas]], with [[Matt Thiessen]] joining in on the  first and second verses.
* The album contains re-recorded versions of songs from their 1998 demo ''[[All Work and No Play]]''. These songs include the ''[[ThunderCats]]''-themed "I'm Lion-O" and "For the Moments I Feel Faint", which is a slower, acoustic recording of the song "C.U.R.B.".
* The music video for this album is "[[Pressing On]]", but the original song chosen for a video was actually "[[Sadie Hawkins Dance (song)|Sadie Hawkins Dance]]". {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} In the end, they went with "Pressing On", as they didn't have the budget to do what they wanted for "[[Sadie Hawkins Dance (song)|Sadie Hawkins Dance]]". Matt Thiessen once said this on the band's forum. One plan for the "Sadie Hawkins Dance" video actually included [[Gary Coleman]]. [http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/July01.asp]
* The resulting video for "[[Pressing On]]" shows the band making their way into a building amidst a crowd of fans. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a producer waiting to film a music video with them. When one member asks the director if he can have a drink, he is told that there is no budget for that&nbsp;<U+2014> a parody derived from the above trivia item.
* The song "Sadie Hawkins Dance" once appeared in an episode of the show ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''.
* A tentative track listing for this album originally included the song "Operation", which was eventually used as an exclusive song for ''[[The Creepy EP]]'' instead.
* The song "I'm Lion-O" has similar chords in the beginning as the song "For The Band" on the ''[[Employee of the Month EP]]''.
* The song "[[Pressing On]]" appeared in an episode of the show ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]''.
