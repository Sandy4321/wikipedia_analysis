The '''Sylver''' (SYSt<U+00E8>me de Lancement VERtical) is a vertical [[missile]] launcher designed by [[DCNS]]. The launcher comes in several variants, each distinguished by their height. A-35 and A-43 was developed for launching short range surface-to-air missiles, the A-50 for the long-range [[PAAMS]] air defense system, and the A-70 launcher for larger missiles such as the SCALP Naval land attack cruise missile. The numbers refer to the approximate length of the missile which can be accommodated, in decimetres, i.e. the A-43 can hold missiles which are up to 4.3 metres long whilst the A-70 can accommodate missiles up to 7 metres long.

The launchers come in eight-cell modules, except A-35 available in four-cell modules, with each eight-cell module occupying six square metres of deck space. Inner size cell is 60 cm long and 56 cm wide, and each cell has its own exhaust vent. [[Crotale_missile| Crotale NG (VT1)]] missiles can be quad-packed in once cell.

The primary application of the launcher has been the [[MBDA Aster]] missile. The Sylver, together with the Aster, is the primary component of the PAAMS naval anti-air warfare system. Using PAAMS, up to eight missiles can be launched in 10 seconds.

The French Navy has initiated studies to convert the [[Storm Shadow|SCALP EG]] missile to be capable of launch from the Sylver. This missile, the SCALP Naval, would give [[France]] a land attack capability in the mould of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Tomahawk missile]]. It would also be attractive to the [[Royal Navy]], whose [[Type 45 destroyer]]s will be equipped with the Sylver launcher, although the A50 type cannot take this missile at present.
