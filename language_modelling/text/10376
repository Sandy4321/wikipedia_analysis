'''Cinderella''' is an [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. They emerged in the mid-1980s with a series of [[multi-platinum]] albums and hit singles whose [[music video]]s received heavy [[MTV]] rotation. They were famous for being a [[glam metal]] and [[hard rock]] band, but then shifted over towards a more [[blues-rock]] sound. By the mid-1990s, the band's popularity declined severely due to personal setbacks and public changes in musical tastes. 

==History==
===1980s===
Cinderella was formed in [[Philadelphia]] in 1983 by [[singer-songwriter]], [[keyboardist]], and [[guitarist]] [[Tom Keifer]] and [[bassist]] [[Eric Brittingham]]. The initial lineup also included guitarist [[Michael Smerick]] and [[drummer]] [[Tony Destra]]. In 1985, Smerick and Destra left to form [[Britny Fox]], another Philadelphia-based [[glam metal]] band that later relocated to [[Los Angeles]]. Cinderella got their big break when [[Jon Bon Jovi]] saw them perform at the [[Empire Rock Club]] in Philadelphia and recommended that his [[A&R]] rep  [[Derek Shulman]] who knew of the band, to see them as well.<ref>Newall, Mike ([[March 10]], [[2005]]). "[http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2005-03-10/cover5.shtml Hit Paraders]". ''Philadelphia City Paper''. Retrieved on [[May 23]], [[2007]].</ref> In 1985, with a [[recording contract]] with Mercury/Polygram Records in the works, [[guitarist]] [[Jeff LaBar]] and [[drummer]] [[Jim Drnec]] joined the band.

During the recording of the band's debut album, ''[[Night Songs]]'', studio session drummer [[Jody Cortez]] was brought in when [[record producer|producer]] [[Andy Johns]] found Drnec difficult to work with.<ref>''[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8tkku3t5anxk~T2 Night Songs credits]''at allmusic.com</ref> While finishing the recording, Drnec was replaced by former [[London (heavy metal band)|London]] drummer [[Fred Coury]], who joined in time to make the album's cover and play on upcoming tours. ''Night Songs'' was released on August 2, 1986 and eventually achieved triple [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status, selling 50,000 copies per week at one point. The album reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 200|Billboard]] charts in February 1987.

Cinderella's first tour was in 1986 with fellow glam metal rockers [[Poison (band)|Poison]], opening for [[Japan]]ese [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]]. Further tours into 1987 were spent playing to large [[arena]] audiences: five months opening for former [[Van Halen]] frontman [[David Lee Roth]], and seven months with [[Bon Jovi]], taking the opening slot for their ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' tour. Later that year, the band went overseas, appearing in Japan, [[Scandinavia]], and at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in [[England]] and [[Germany]].

Cinderella's second album, ''[[Long Cold Winter]]'', was released in 1988. It signified a shift towards [[blues-rock]], though it could still be described as glam metal. A 254-show tour to support the album lasted over 14 months and included dates on the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]] alongside other metal acts, such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Skid Row (heavy metal band)|Skid Row]]. The tour's stage show included Keifer being lowered to the stage while playing a white piano during their radio hit "[[Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)]]".

===1990s===
Cinderella's third album, ''[[Heartbreak Station]]'', was released in 1990. It featured even more songs than ''Long Cold Winter'' that were influenced by Keifer's love of the [[blues]], completely ditching the band's trademark glam metal sound. Following the accompanying tour, Fred Coury left the band and joined former [[Ratt]] vocalist [[Stephen Pearcy]] in the band [[Arcade (band)|Arcade]].

In 1991, Keifer completely lost his voice due to a [[paresis]] of his [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]]. He underwent several surgeries to repair a vocal cyst and hemorrhage.<ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, pages 369-370, ISBN 0-609-80732-3</ref> This added to delays in the recording of the band's fourth album, ''[[Still Climbing (Cinderella album)|Still Climbing]]''. It was finally released in 1994 with [[Kenny Aronoff]] on drums, but with little support from their label, none from MTV, and the current music scene being dominated by [[grunge]], the album quickly disappeared from the charts. The band went on hiatus in 1995.

Cinderella resumed activity in 1996, the same year [[Mercury Records]] released a greatest hits compilation titled ''[[Once Upon a...]]'' The group toured the United States in 1998, with one stop captured on the live album ''[[Live at the Key Club]]'', which was released in 1999 through [[Cleopatra Records]].

===2000s===
Around 1999, the band was signed by [[John Kalodner]] to [[Sony Records]]. However, the band was dropped by the label before a new album could be released, plunging the band into three years of litigation.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=55269 Jeff LaBar interview @ Blabbermouth.net (2006)]</ref> Cinderella toured again in 2000 and 2002.

As of the mid-2000s, Eric Brittingham is working with his wife's band, [[Naked Beggars]]. Jeff LaBar has an internet radio show, [[Late Night with the LaBars]], with his wife Debby on [[www.realityradio.biz]]. Fred Coury is working with numerous bands in the studio and film, and Tom Keifer is working on a solo album. Cinderella headlined the [[VH1 Classic]] [[Rock Never Stops Tour|Rock Never Stops]] 2005 summer tour. In 2005 Cinderella toured with [[Firehouse]], [[RATT]], and [[Quiet Riot]].  [[Mercury Records]] released the compilation ''[[Rocked, Wired & Bluesed: The Greatest Hits]]'' on CD and DVD.

In 2006 Cinderella toured with Poison.  Both bands celebrated the 20th anniversary of their debut albums, ''[[Night Songs]]'' and ''[[Look What the Cat Dragged In]]''. The tour was a success and became one of the most successful tours of 2006, averaging about 20,000 people in attendance per night. {{fact|date=December 2009}}

Cinderella planned to tour in 2008 with [[Warrant (band)|Warrant]], [[Lynch Mob (band)|Lynch Mob]], and [[Lynam (band)|Lynam]], but on June 13 that year, Tim Heyne, the band's manager, said in a press release: <U+201C>It is with unbelievably deep regret that I must announce that Cinderella's Tom Keifer's left [[vocal cord]] has hemorrhaged, thereby making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future.<U+201D> Also in 2008, Brittingham was a guest on ''The Classic Metal Show'' and explained Cinderella's status.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI3vKPFZPco Eric Brittingham interview]. ''The Classic Metal Show'', 2008.</ref> When Lebar was interviewed by ''Ultimate-Guitar'', he stated that Cinderella would love to make a new record but there were obstacles holding the group back. They still were not signed to a record label after Sony dropped the band in 2000. Lebar also stated that he is busy with his new band, Freakshow, which features Frankie Banali of [[Quiet Riot]], and Eric is busy with Naked Beggars. Jeff also stated that it would be a matter of timing. Tom Keifer still has yet to also release his solo album, which has been in the works for almost eight years. {{fact|date=December 2009}}

According to Cinderella's message board in spring of 2009, Tom Keifer's voice has returned to normal. Promoters from the 2009 Rock Gone Wild Festival have confirmed that the band is scheduled to perform at two festivals in late summer or early fall of 2009. It had been said that Cinderella is planning to release a CD from the Live Tour ''Rock Never Stop'', which was set to be released on November 6, 2009.
