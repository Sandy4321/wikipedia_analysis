'''Coffee''' is a widely consumed [[stimulant]] [[drink|beverage]] prepared from roasted [[seed]]s, commonly called [[coffee bean]]s, of the [[Coffea|coffee plant]]. Coffee was first consumed in the 9th century, when it was discovered in the highlands of [[Ethiopia]].<ref name="EA763">Mekete Belachew, "Coffee," in von Uhlig, Siegbert, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'' (Weissbaden: Horrowitz, 2003), p.763.</ref>  From there, it spread to [[Egypt]] and [[Yemen]], and by the 15th century had reached [[Persia]], [[Turkey]], and [[northern Africa]].

Coffee berries, which contain the coffee bean, are produced by several species of small evergreen bush of the [[genus (biology)|genus]] ''Coffea''. The two most commonly grown species are ''[[Coffea canephora]]'' (also known as ''[[Coffea robusta]]'') and ''[[Coffea arabica]]''. These are cultivated in [[Latin America]], [[southeast Asia]], and [[Africa]]. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. The seeds are then roasted, undergoing several physical and chemical changes. They are roasted to various degrees, depending on the desired flavor. They are then ground and [[brewing (cooking)|brewed]] to create coffee. Coffee can be prepared and presented by a variety of methods.

Coffee has played an important role in many societies throughout modern history. In Africa and Yemen, it was used in religious ceremonies. As a result, the [[Ethiopian Church]] banned its consumption until the reign of Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia]].<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: [[Addis Ababa University|Haile Selassie I University]], 1968), p. 198</ref> It was banned in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey in the 17th century for political reasons, and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word  ''coffee'' first came to be used in the early- to mid-1600s, but early forms of the word date to the last decade of the 1500s.<ref>{{cite web | title =Coffee | work =Etymology Dictionary Online | publisher=Douglas Harper | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=coffee | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}</ref> It comes from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''caff<U+00E8>''. This, in turn, was borrowed from the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''kahveh'', and the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''qahwa'' (<U+0642><U+0647><U+0648><U+0629>) collectively.<ref>{{cite web | title =Coffee | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary | publisher =Merriam-Webster Online | url =http://m-w.com/dictionary/coffee | accessdate =2007-07-27  }}</ref> The origin of the Arabic term is uncertain; it is either derived from the name of the [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]] region in western [[Ethiopia]], where coffee was cultivated, or by a truncation of ''qahwat al-b<U+016B>nn'', meaning "wine of the bean" in Arabic. In [[Eritrea]], "b<U+016B>nn" (also meaning "wine of the bean" in [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]) is used.<ref>{{cite web | title =Coffee | work =The Oxford English Dictionary Online | publisher =Oxford English Dictionary | url =http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50043279?query_type=word&queryword=coffee&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&search_id=G0C1-u4sQqW-24389&result_place=1

Coffee use can be traced at least to as early as the 9th century, when it appeared in the [[Ethiopian Highlands|highlands of Ethiopia]].<ref name="EA763">Mekete Belachew, "Coffee," in von Uhlig, Siegbert, ed., ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'' (Weissbaden: Horrowitz, 2003), p.763.</ref> According to legend, Ethiopian [[Goatherd|shepherd]]s were the first to observe the influence of the [[caffeine]] in coffee beans when the goats appeared to "dance" and to have an increased level of energy after consuming wild coffee berries.<ref name="James"/>  The legend names the shepherd "Kaldi."

From the [[Muslim]] world, coffee spread to Italy. The thriving trade between [[Venice]] and North [[Africa]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Middle East]] brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by [[Pope Clement VIII]] in 1600, despite appeals to ban the "Muslim drink". The first European coffee house opened in Italy in 1645.<ref name="Meyers">{{cite web

When coffee reached [[North America]] during the colonial period, it was initially not as successful as it had been in Europe. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], however, the demand for coffee increased so much that dealers had to hoard their scarce supplies and raise prices dramatically; this was partly due to the reduced availability of tea from [[Great Britain|British]] merchants.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/coffee?cat=health |author= Columbia Encyclopedia |title=Coffee|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> After the [[War of 1812]], during which Britain temporarily cut off access to [[tea]] imports, the Americans' taste for coffee grew, and high demand during the [[American Civil War]] together with advances in brewing technology secured the position of coffee as an everyday commodity in the United States.<ref>{{citeweb | publisher=All Business | title=Roasted Coffee  (SIC 2095)|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/food-kindred-products/miscellaneous-food-preparations/3777798-9.html}}</ref>

Noted as one of the world<U+2019>s largest, most lawfully valuable traded commodity after oil, has become a vital <U+201C>cash crop<U+201D> for many Third World countries. Over one hundred million people in developing countries have become dependent on coffee as the primary source of income (Ponte 1). Coffee has become the primary export and backbone for African countries like Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and Ethiopia as well as other Central American countries (1)

Coffee price deregulations had a negative effect on oversupply in the coffee industry. The failure to renew regulatory agreements brought extreme and unstable changes in coffee pricing, which impacted negatively farm-workers. Some countries went into financial crisis and/or debt and their citizens were forced into poverty. After studying coffee price deregulation, one can easily conclude that it has been disastrous for many national economies. The simple comparison between the price of a pound of coffee sold in a store and the actual cost for a farmer to produce the pound of coffee is an appropriate topic of introduction. <U+201C>If a store is selling a 1lb bag of coffee for $4.99lb. - when approx. actual cost for 1lb should be $1.68 to the farmer; $1.82 for sorting, packaging, equipment cost, overhead; $1.05 mark-up; $1.40 for shipping = $5.95 - this is the what the wholesale cost to retailers for 1lb of coffee should be under Fair Trade principles<U+201D> then by having retailers mark up their prices would require the to sell the pound of coffee for $11.90 instead of $4.99 (http://www.sevenshorestrading.com/section/view/?fnode=73). The numbers show that coffee is undervalued which results in the underpayment of farmers. This comparison is important for understanding fair pricing of coffee.

[[Image:Coffee Flowers Show.jpg|thumb|right|A flowering ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' tree in a Brazilian plantation]]

The ''Coffea'' plant is native to  subtropical [[Africa]] and southern [[Asia]].<ref name="ICO"/>
It belongs to a [[genus]] of 10 species of [[flowering plant]]s of the family ''[[Rubiaceae]]''. It is an [[evergreen]] shrub or small tree that may grow 5&nbsp;meters (16&nbsp;ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10<U+2013>15&nbsp;centimeters (3.9<U+2013>5.9&nbsp;in) long and 6.0&nbsp;centimeters (2.4&nbsp;in) wide. It produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom simultaneously. The fruit berry is oval, about 1.5&nbsp;centimeters (0.6&nbsp;in) long,<ref name="Purdue"/> and green when immature, but ripens to yellow, then crimson, becoming black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but from 5 to 10 percent of the berries<ref>{{cite web | url=http://aco.ca/peaberry_coffee | title=Feature Article: Peaberry Coffee | accessdate=2006-11-10 }}</ref> have only one; these are called [[peaberry|peaberries]].<ref>S.

==Cultivation==

Coffee is usually propagated by seed. The traditional method of planting coffee is to put 20 seeds in each hole at the beginning of the rainy season; half are eliminated naturally. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice, during the first few years of cultivation.<ref name="Purdue">{{cite web

The two main cultivated species of the coffee plant are ''[[Coffea canephora]]'' and ''[[Coffea arabica]]''. Arabica coffee (from ''C. arabica'') is considered more suitable for drinking than robusta coffee (from ''C. canephora''); robusta tends to be bitter and have less flavor than arabica. For this reason, about three-fourths of coffee cultivated worldwide is ''C. arabica''.<ref name="ICO">{{cite web

  | url =http://www.ico.org/botanical.asp
  | accessdate = 2007-07-19 }}</ref> However, ''C. canephora'' is less susceptible to disease than ''C. arabica'' and can be cultivated in [[Natural environment|environments]] where ''C. arabica'' will not thrive. Robusta coffee also contains about 40<U+2013>50 percent more caffeine than arabica.<ref name="EA763" /> For this reason, it is used as an inexpensive substitute for arabica in many commercial coffee blends.  Good quality robustas are used in some [[espresso]] blends to provide a better foam head and to lower the ingredient cost.<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite web

Most arabica coffee beans originate from either [[Latin America]], [[eastern Africa]], Arabia, or Asia. Robusta coffee beans are grown in western and [[central Africa]], throughout [[southeast Asia]], and to some extent in Brazil.<ref name="ICO"/> Beans from different countries or regions usually have distinctive characteristics such as flavor, aroma, [[mouthfeel|body]], and acidity.<ref>''Coffee: A Guide to Buying Brewing and Enjoying, 5th Edition'', by Kenneth Davids</ref> These taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee's growing region, but also on genetic subspecies ([[Variety (biology)|varietals]]) and processing.<ref name="castle">{{cite book

===Ecological effects===
Originally, coffee farming was done in the [[shade]] of trees, which provided habitat for many animals and insects.<ref name=Janzen> {{cite book | last= Janzen | first = Daniel H. (Editor)| year = 1983 | title = Natural History of Costa Rica | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, IL | isbn = 0226393348}}</ref> This method is commonly referred to as the traditional shaded method. Many farmers (but not all) have decided to modernize their production methods and switch to a method where farmers would now use sun cultivation, in which coffee is grown in rows under full sun with little or no forest canopy. This causes berries to ripen more rapidly and bushes to produce higher yields but requires the clearing of trees and increased use of fertilizer and pesticides.<ref>{{cite web

In addition, the traditional shaded method is environmentally friendly and serves as a habitat for many species.Opponents of sun cultivation say environmental problems such as deforestation, pesticide pollution, [[habitat destruction]], and soil and water degradation are the side effects of these practices.<ref name=Janzen/> The [[American Birding Association]] has led a campaign for "shade-grown" and organic coffees, which it says are sustainably harvested.<ref>[http://www.thanksgivingcoffee.com/justcup/songbird/whatisit.lasso Song Bird Coffee].

The concept of [[fair trade]] labeling, which  guarantees coffee growers a negotiated pre-harvest price, began with the [[Stichting Max Havelaar|Max Havelaar Foundation]]'s labelling program in the Netherlands. In 2004, 24,222 metric tons out of 7,050,000 produced worldwide were fair trade; in 2005, 33,991 metric tons out of 6,685,000 were fair trade, an increase from 0.34 percent to 0.51 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ico.org/prices/po.htm| title=Total Production of Exporting Countries| Publisher=International Coffee Organization| accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html| title=FLO International: Coffee| Publisher=Fair Trade.net| accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref> A number of studies have shown that fair trade coffee has a positive impact on the communities that grow it.

==Processing==
===Roasting===
[[Image:Espresso-roasted coffee beans.jpg|180px|thumb|Roasted coffee beans]]
{{main|Coffee processing|Coffee roasting}}
Coffee berries and their seeds undergo multi-step processing before they become the roasted coffee with which most consumers are familiar. First, coffee berries are picked, generally by hand. Then, they are sorted by ripeness and color and the [[Fruit#Fruit development|flesh]] of the berry is removed, usually by machine, and the seeds<U+2014>usually called beans<U+2014>are fermented to remove the slimy layer of [[mucilage]] still present on the bean. When the [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] is finished, the beans are washed with large quantities of fresh water to remove the fermentation residue, which generates massive amounts of highly polluted [[coffee wastewater]]. Finally the seeds are dried, sorted, and labeled as green coffee beans.<ref>Kummer, Corby. ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0618302409/ The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying]'', Houghton Mifflin, 38. August 19, 2003. ISBN 978-0618302406.</ref>

The next step in the process is the roasting of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold [[Coffee roasting|roasted]] by the supplier, or it can be [[Home roasting coffee|home roasted]].<ref>Kummer, Corby. ''[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0618302409/ The Joy of Coffee: The Essential Guide to Buying, Brewing, and Enjoying]'', Houghton Mifflin, 37. August 19, 2003. ISBN 978-0618302406.</ref> The roasting [[process]] influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost but increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging. The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches 200 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (392 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]), though different varieties of beans differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates.<ref name="trent"/> During roasting, [[caramelization]] occurs as intense heat breaks down [[starch]]es in the bean, changing them to [[simple sugar]]s that begin to brown, changing the color of the bean.<ref>Kummer, Corby.

Depending on the color of the roasted beans, they will be labeled as light, medium-light, medium, medium-dark, dark, or very dark.  Darker roasts are generally smoother, because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have more caffeine, resulting in a slight bitterness, and a stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids destroyed by longer roasting times.<ref name="Mauro">{{cite web

===Storage===
Once roasted, coffee beans must be stored properly to preserve the fresh taste of the bean.  Ideal conditions are air-tight and cool.  Air, moisture, heat and light are the environmental factors<ref name="foodnetwork-truebrew">{{cite web |url= http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_10020,00.html |title= True Brew |author= [[Alton Brown]] |publisher= [[Food Network]] |accessdate= 2008-02-18 }}</ref> in order of importance to preserving flavor in coffee beans. 

Folded-over bags, a common way consumers often purchase coffee, is generally not ideal for long-term storage because it allows air to enter. A better package contains a one-way valve, which prevents air from entering.<ref name="foodnetwork-truebrew"/>

===Preparation===

[[Image:linea doubleespresso.jpg|thumb|right|Espresso brewing, with dark reddish-brown ''crema'']]
Coffee beans must be ground and [[brewing (cooking)|brewed]] in order to create a beverage. Grinding the roasted coffee beans is done at a roastery, in a grocery store, or in the home. They are most commonly ground at a roastery then packaged and sold to the consumer, though "whole bean" coffee can be ground at home. Coffee beans may be ground in several ways. A [[burr mill]] uses revolving elements to crush or tear the bean, an electric grinder chops the beans with blades moving at high speeds, and a mortar and pestle grinds the beans to a powder.<ref>{{cite book

The most common grinds are between the extremes; a medium grind is used in most common home coffee brewing machines.<ref name="faq"/> 

Coffee may be brewed by several methods: boiled, steeped, or pressured. Brewing coffee by boiling was the earliest method, and [[Turkish coffee]] is an example of this method.<ref name= "Harrison"/> It is prepared by powdering the beans with a [[mortar and pestle]], then adding the powder to water and bringing it to a boil in a pot called a [[cezve]] or, in Greek, a briki.

Machines such as [[Coffee percolator|percolator]]s or [[Coffeemaker|automatic coffeemaker]]s brew coffee by gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water  drips onto coffee grounds held in a [[coffee filter]] made of paper or perforated metal, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while absorbing its oils and essences. Gravity causes the liquid to pass into a carafe or pot while the used [[Coffee preparation|coffee grounds]] are retained in the filter.<ref name= "Levy"/> In a percolator, boiling water is forced into a chamber above a filter by pressure created by boiling. The water then passes downwards through the grounds due to gravity, repeating the process until shut off by an internal timer.<ref name= "Levy">{{cite book

Coffee may also be brewed by steeping in a device such as a [[French press]] (also known as a ''cafeti<U+00E8>re''). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a coffee press and left to brew for a few minutes. A plunger is then depressed to separate the coffee grounds, which remain at the bottom of the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the beverage, making it stronger and leaving more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine.<ref>{{cite book

The [[espresso]] method forces hot, but not boiling, pressurized water through ground coffee. As a result of brewing under high pressure (ideally between 9-10 atm) the espresso beverage is more concentrated (as much as 10 to 15 times the amount of coffee to water as gravity brewing methods can produce) and has a more complex physical and chemical constitution.  A well prepared espresso has a reddish-brown foam called ''crema'' that floats on the surface.<ref name="faq">{{cite web

Once brewed, coffee may be presented in a variety of ways. Drip brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafeti<U+00E8>re coffee may be served with no additives (colloquially known as black) or with either sugar, milk or cream, or both. When served cold, it is called [[iced coffee]]. 

Espresso-based coffee has a wide variety of possible presentations.

Coffee was initially used for spiritual reasons.  At least 1,000 years ago, traders brought coffee across the [[Red Sea]] into Arabia (modern day Yemen), where Muslim monks began cultivating the shrub in their gardens. At first, the Arabians made wine from the pulp of the fermented coffee berries. This beverage was known as ''qishr'' (''kisher'' in modern usage) and was used during religious ceremonies.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
