'''Mount Albion Cemetery''' is located on [[New York State Route 31]] in the [[Albion (town), New York|Town of Albion]], New York, United States, east of the [[Albion (village), New York|village of Albion]], which owns and operates it. It is a [[rural cemetery]] established in the 1840s on a glacial [[drumlin]].

From its original {{convert|25|acre|ha}}, it has almost tripled in size. Graves are on [[terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in the rolling terrain. Tall trees, including some locally rare species,<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" /> maintain a parklike atmosphere. Its notable monuments include a local [[American Civil War|Civil War]] memorial, a chapel and entrance arch. The dead buried there include [[Rufus Bullock]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[List of governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] and nine congressmen from two other states beside New York.

In 1976 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]]. It was the first property in [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]] listed on the Register, and is so far the only one in the Town of Albion.

==Grounds==

The cemetery is a {{convert|70|acre|ha|adj=on}} rectangular parcel on the south side of Route 31 between the Butts and Keitel Road intersections, {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} east of the village of Albion. Its terrain is gently rolling, dominated by a {{convert|680|ft|m||adj=on}} hill in the southeast quadrant.<ref name="Albion quad">{{cite map |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |title=Albion Quadrangle <U+2013> New York <U+2013> Orleans Co. |url=http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=43.239444&lon=-78.155556&datum=nad83&zoom=4 |edition= |year= |scale=1:24,000 |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) |accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref> The area is rural, with the cemetery's [[sandstone]] office and barn located opposite its main entrance, near another smaller cemetery across the street. Immediately west of the lot is a small business. On all other sides the cemetery is surrounded by open lots and worked fields.

The northern three-quarters of the property has tall mature deciduous trees sheltering most of the graves; the southern quarter is open. Among the trees are a rare [[yucca]] and one of the few [[Juglans cinerea|butternuts]] in the area.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" /> Rows of evergreens are located north and south of the hilltop; on the south the land is still wooded and not yet used for burials.

A network of paved roads, many named after trees and shrubs, runs through the cemetery. The rises in the terrain are [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to allow for level gravesites. There are three entrances from Route 31; the central one across from the cemetery offices is the main entrance. It is framed by a [[stonecarving|carved]] [[Medina, New York|Medina]] [[sandstone]] arch with a slate roof and iron gates. A short distance south is a small parking lot and sandstone chapel, a Gothic building with steep [[gable]]d roof shingled in slate.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" />
{{external media|align=left|width=200px|video1=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYzRoXoXDB0 Walking - Down the Mt. Albion Cemetery Tower]}}
Atop the hill in the southeast quadrant is the cylindrical {{convert|58|ft|m|adj=mid|-foot high}} Soldier's and Sailor's Monument, also of red sandstone. A pointed-arched door on the north side opens to a spiral staircase climbing to the overlook at the top,<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" /> which offers 360-degree views of the surrounding countryside.

In the northwest corner of the cemetery is a small square pond fed by a natural [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]. It is trimmed with sandstone and [[granite]]. On its south side is a domed sandstone [[spring house]] with "1908" carved into it.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" />

==History==

Mt. Albion was established 11 years after [[Mt. Auburn Cemetery]] in Massachusetts popularized the [[rural cemetery]], where graves were located in a parklike setting outside an urban area. Two local citizens urged the village's trustees to buy {{convert|25|acre|ha}} including Mount Albion, a high [[drumlin]] that overlooked the village area from the southeast. Years later local historians agreed that they could not have found a more ideal location anywhere else in the area. 
A former engineer on the nearby [[Erie Canal]], Marvin Porter, has been credited with the [[landscape architecture|design]] of the landscape in the eastern, oldest portion of the cemetery. Other sources suggest that there was little formal organization and [[burial plot|plot]] owners largely took care of their areas themseves.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" />

The sandstone buildings reflect the prosperous output of local quarries at that time. After another {{convert|13.5|acre|ha}} was added on the west of the original cemetery in 1872, sandstone was used for the monument to local war dead on the cemetery's highest point two years later. Local architect William V.N. Barlow, [[William V. N. Barlow House|whose house]] in the village of Albion is also on the Register, designed the chapel and entrance gate in the early 1880s.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" />

By 1894 the cemetery had reached its present size. As it expanded, the parklike atmosphere was maintained. The rises were terraced with the dells between them kept flat. Trees and shrubs similar to those in the eastern half were planted, some in an orchard. Further park amenities, such as the 1908 pond and the Ingersoll Memorial Fountain in front of the chapel in 1914, were added.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny" />
