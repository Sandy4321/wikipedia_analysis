The '''Fresno Grizzlies''' are a [[minor league baseball]] team based in [[Fresno, California]].  The team, which plays in the [[Pacific Coast League]], is the Triple-A affiliate of the [[San Francisco Giants]] [[Major League Baseball|major league]] club.  The Grizzlies play in [[Chukchansi Park]] (cap. 12,500), located in downtown Fresno and constructed in 2002.  The Fresno Grizzlies colors are black and orange, designed to mirror the colors of their parent club.  All games are broadcast on 790 ESPN radio,The Deuce with Doug Greenwald handling the play by play.

Professional baseball first came to Fresno in 1898 when it had a team in the original [[California League]].  The team dropped out of the league after that year, but returned in 1905.  In 1906, the [[Tacoma Tigers]] of the Pacific Coast League moved to Fresno, playing as the [[Fresno Raisin Eaters]] for one season before moving to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for the 1907 season. In the intervening years before the arrival of the Grizzlies, Fresno fielded teams in the California State League in 1910 and 1913, and in the current [[California League]] from 1941 through 1988, including the [[Fresno Cardinals]] (1941-1956), Fresno Sun Sox (1957), Fresno Giants (1958-1987),and Fresno Suns (1988).

When the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] expansion franchise was awarded to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] by Major League Baseball to begin play in 1998, the existing [[Phoenix Firebirds]] PCL team, at the time the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants']] Triple-A affiliate, was forced to relocate.  In a complicated series of events, the owners of the Firebirds moved their team to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and became the [[Tucson Sidewinders]], dropping their affiliation with the Giants in favor of the expansion Diamondbacks.  The owners of the existing [[Tucson Toros]] then moved their franchise to Fresno, thus ending a 92-year hiatus of PCL baseball in Fresno.  The transplanted Toros, renamed the Grizzlies, became the Giants' new PCL affiliate.  From 1998 through 2001 the Grizzlies played at [[Pete Beiden Field]] at [[California State University, Fresno]]. 

During the team's eight-year tenure in Fresno, it has had a number of different owners.  In October, 2005 it was announced the team had been sold again, this time to Fresno Baseball LLC, headquartered in [[Stoneham, Massachusetts]].
