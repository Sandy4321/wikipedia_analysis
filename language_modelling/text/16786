[[Biblical Hebrew]] {{lang|he|<U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05BC><U+05E8>}})  was a [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|city]] in ancient [[Sumer]], located at the site of modern '''Tell el-Mukayyar''' in [[Iraq]]'s [[Dhi Qar Governorate]].<ref>[[Tell el-Mukayyar]]&ndash; in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Tell'' means "mound" or "hill" and ''Mukayyar'' means "built of bitumen". Mukayyar is variously transcribed as Mugheir, Mughair, Moghair, Muqayyar etc.</ref> 
Once a coastal city near the mouth of the then [[Euphrates]] river on the [[Persian Gulf]], Ur is now well inland. Currently, Ur is south of the Euphrates on its right bank, {{convert|16|km}} from [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq and close to the site of ancient [[Eridu]].

The city's patron deity was [[Nanna]], the Sumerian [[Lunar deity|moon god]], and the name of the city is in origin derived from the god's name, {{lang|sux-Latn|URIM<sub>2</sub><sup>KI</sup>}} being the classical Sumerian spelling of [[Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen|LAK]]-32.UNUG<sup>KI</sup>, literally "the abode (UNUG) of Nanna (LAK-32)".<ref>''[[Reallexikon der Assyriologie]]'', 1997, ISBN 9783110148091, [http://books.google.com/books?id=O1yFrzi-MgYC&pg=RA2-PA360&lpg=RA2-PA360&dq=%22LAK32.NA%22&source=bl&ots=EdyMpkD6IK&sig=Wa3_AX4ZHkYZTyohXRIUeN4SY24&hl=en&ei=5mR5SrusDcOg_AaomoiABg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=%22LAK32.NA%22&f=false p.360]</ref>

The site is marked by the ruins of the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]], which contained the shrine of Nanna, excavated in the 1930s. The temple was built in the 21st century BC ([[short chronology]]), during the reign of Ur-Nammu and was reconstructed in the 6th century BC by [[Nabonidus]]. 

==History==
===Early history===
Ur was inhabited in the earliest stage of village settlement in the southern part of Mesopotamia, the [[Ubaid period]]. However, it later appears to have been abandoned for a time. Scholars believe that, as the climate changed from relatively damp to drought in the early [[3rd millennium BCE]], the small farming villages of the Ubaid culture consolidated into larger settlements, arising from the need for large-scale, centralized [[irrigation]] works to survive the dry spells. Ur became one such center, and by around 2600 BCE, in the Sumerian [[Sumerian king list|Early Dynastic Period III]], the city was again thriving. Ur by this time was considered sacred to the god called [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]] (Sumerian) or Sin (Akkadian).<ref> Iroku, Osita; "A Day in the Life of God"; 2008; published by the Enlil Institute </ref>

[[Image:Meso2mil.JPG|300px|left|thumb|[[Mesopotamia]] in the [[3rd millennium BC]]]]
The location of Ur was favourable for trade, by both sea and land routes, into [[Arabia]]. Many elaborate tombs, including that of Queen [[Puabi]],<ref name="puabi">Queen Puabi is also written Pu-Abi and formerly transcribed as Shub-ab.</ref> were constructed. In this cemetery were also found artifacts bearing the names of kings [[Meskalamdug]] and [[Akalamdug]]. 

Eventually, the kings of Ur became the effective rulers of [[Sumer]], in the [[first dynasty of Ur]] established by the king [[Mesannepada]] (or Mesanepada, Mes-Anni-Padda), who is on the [[Sumerian king list|king list]] and is named as a son of Meskalamdug on one artifact.

===Middle Bronze Age===

The first dynasty was ended by an attack of [[Sargon of Akkad]] around [[24th century BCE|2340 BCE]]. Not much is known about the following second dynasty, when the city was in eclipse. 

The [[3rd dynasty of Ur|third dynasty]] was established when the king [[Ur-Nammu]] (or Urnammu) came to power, ruling between ca. 2047 BCE and 2030 BCE. During his rule, temples, including the ziggurat, were built, and [[agriculture]] was improved through [[irrigation]]. His code of laws, the ''[[Code of Ur-Nammu]]'' (a fragment was identified in [[Istanbul]] in 1952) is one of the oldest such documents known, preceding the [[code of Hammurabi]] by 300 years. He and his successor [[Shulgi]] were both deified during their reigns, and after his death he continued as a hero-figure: one of the surviving works of Sumerian literature describes the death of Ur-Nammu and his journey to the underworld.

The Ur empire continued through the reigns of three more kings,
[[Amar-Sin]], [[Shu-Sin]], and [[Ibbi-Sin]]. It
fell around 1940 BC to the [[Elam]]ites in the 24th [[regnal year]] of
Ibbi-Sin, an event commemorated by the [[Lament for Ur]].

According to one estimate, Ur was the largest city in the world from c. 2030 to 1980 BCE. Its population was approximately 65,000.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm Largest Cities Through History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Iron Age===
In the sixth century BCE there was new construction in Ur under the rule of [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon]]. The last Babylonian king, [[Nabonidus]], improved the ziggurat. However the city started to decline from around 550 BCE and was no longer inhabited after about 500 BCE, perhaps owing to drought, changing river patterns, and the silting of the outlet to the [[Persian Gulf]].

==Biblical Ur==
{{main|Ur Kasdim}}
Ur is considered by many to be the city of [[Ur Kasdim]] mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] as the birthplace of the patriarch Abram ([[Abraham]]).

Ur is mentioned four times in the [[Tanakh]] or [[Old Testament]], with the distinction "of the Kasdim/Kasdin"&mdash;traditionally rendered in English as "Ur of the Chaldees". The [[Chaldea]]ns, who were already settled in the vicinity by around 850 BCE. The name is found in {{bibleverse||Genesis|11:28|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Genesis|11:31|KJV}}, and {{bibleverse||Genesis|15:7|KJV}}. In ''[[Nehemiah]]'' 9:7, a single passage mentioning Ur is a paraphrase of ''Genesis.'' ({{bibleverse||Nehemiah|9:7|KJV}})

The ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'' states that Ur was founded in 1688 ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' (year of the world) by 'Ur son of Kesed, presumably the offspring of [[Arphaxad]], adding that in this same year wars began on Earth.

:"And 'Ur, the son of Kesed, built the city of 'Ara of the Chaldees, and called its name after his own name and the name of his father." (i.e., ''Ur Kesdim'') (Jubilees 11:3) <!---doesn't work but might if correct version were used ({{bibleverse||Jubilees|11:3|KJV}})---->

==Archaeology==
[[Image:Ur-Nassiriyah.jpg|thumb|right|Archeological excavations at [[Tell el-Mukayyar]], [[Iraq]]]]
In the 1625, the site was visited by [[Pietro della Valle]], who recorded the presence of ancient bricks stamped with strange symbols, cemented together with [[bitumen]], as well as inscribed pieces of black marble that appeared to be [[seal (device)|seals]].

The site was first excavated in 1853 and 1854 by John George Taylor, British vice-counsel at Basra from 1851-1859. 
<ref>J. E. Taylor, Notes on the Ruins of Muqeyer, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. 15, pp. 260-276, 1855</ref>
<ref>JE Taylor, Notes on Abu Shahrein and Tel-el-Lahm, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. 15 , pp. 404-415, 1855.
In the relevant publications he is erroneously listed as J. E. Taylor.</ref>
<ref>E. Sollberger, Mr. Taylor in Chaldaea, Anatolian Studies, vol. 22, pp. 129-139 , 1972</ref>
He worked on behalf of the [[British Museum]].
Taylor found clay cylinders in the four corners of the top stage of the ziggurat which bore an inscription of [[Nabonidus]] (''Nabuna`id''), the last king of Babylon ([[530s BC|539 BCE]]), closing with a prayer for his son Belshar-uzur (Bel-<U+015D>arra-Uzur), the [[Belshazzar]] of the [[Book of Daniel]]. Evidence was found of prior restorations of the ziggurat by [[Ishme-Dagan]] of Isin and [[Shu-Sin]] of Ur, and by [[Kurigalzu]], a [[Kassites|Kassite]] king of Babylon in the fourteenth century BCE. [[Nebuchadnezzar]] also claims to have rebuilt the temple. Taylor further excavated an interesting Babylonian building, not far from the temple, part of an ancient Babylonian [[necropolis]]. All about the city he found abundant remains of burials of later periods. Apparently, in later times, owing to its sanctity, Ur became a favorite place of [[sepulchre]]s, so that even after it had ceased to be inhabited, it continued to be used as a necropolis.

After Taylor's time the site was visited by numerous travelers, almost all of whom have found ancient Babylonian remains, inscribed stones and the like, lying upon the surface. The site was considered rich in remains, and relatively easy to explore. After some soundings were made in
1918 by [[Reginald Campbell Thompson]], H. R. Hill worked
the site for one season for the British Museum in 1919, laying the
groundwork for more extensive efforts to follow.

Excavations from 1922 to 1934 were funded by the [[British Museum]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and led by the [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Charles Leonard Woolley]].

A total of about 1,850 burials were uncovered, including 16 that were described as "royal tombs" containing many valuable artifacts, including the [[Standard of Ur]]. Most of the royal tombs were dated to about 2600 BCE. The finds included the unlooted tomb of a queen thought to be Queen [[Puabi]]<ref name="puabi"/><U+2014>the name is known from a cylinder [[seal (device)|seal]] found in the tomb, although there were two other different and unnamed seals found in the tomb. Many other people had been buried with her, in a form of human sacrifice. Near the [[ziggurat]] were uncovered the temple E-nun-mah and buildings E-dub-lal-mah (built for a king), E-gi-par (residence of the high priestess) and E-hur-sag (a temple building). Outside the temple area, many houses used in everyday life were found. Excavations were also made below the royal tombs layer: a {{convert|3.5|m|adj=on}}-thick layer of alluvial clay covered the remains of earlier habitation, including [[pottery]] from the [[Ubaid period]], the first stage of settlement in southern Mesopotamia. Woolley later wrote many articles and books about the discoveries.<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = | coauthors = Linda Black, Larry S. Krieger, Phillip C.

Most of the treasures excavated at Ur are in the [[British Museum]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]].

In 2009, an agreement was reached for a joint University of Pennsylvania and Iraqi team to resume archaeological work at the site of Ur.

[[Image:UR 17 01 2004 003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Great Ziggurat of Ur]]]]

Though some ome of the areas that were cleared during modern excavations have sanded over again, the [[Great Ziggurat of Ur|Great Ziggurat]] is fully cleared and stands as the best-preserved and only major structure on the site. The top is covered with debris and is at times a confusing mix of loose stones, broken pottery and partial reconstruction.

[[Image:UR 17 01 2004 004.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Royal Tombs of Ur]]
The famous Royal tombs, also called the Neo-[[Sumerian architecture|Sumerian]] Mausolea, located about {{convert|250|m}} south-east of the Great Ziggurat in the corner of the wall that surrounds the city, are nearly totally cleared. Parts of the tomb area appear to be in need of structural consolidation or stabilization.

There are [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] (Sumerian writing) on many walls, some entirely covered in script stamped into the mud-bricks. The text is sometimes difficult to read, but it covers most surfaces.
[[Image:UR 17 01 2004 002.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cuneiform]] writing]]
Modern graffiti has also found its way to the graves, usually in the form of names made with coloured pens (sometimes they are carved). The Great Ziggurat itself has far more graffiti, mostly lightly carved into the bricks.

The graves are completely empty. A small number of the tombs are accessible. Most of them have been cordoned off.
 
The whole site is covered with pottery debris, to the extent that it is virtually impossible to set foot anywhere without stepping on some.   Some have colours and paintings on them. Some of the "mountains" of broken pottery are debris that has been removed from excavations. 

Pottery debris and human remains form many of the walls of the royal tombs area. It can only be speculated whether this is of ancient making or modern restoration, but it is a fact that they are, literally, filled up with pottery debris.

In May 2009, the US Army returned the Ur site to the Iraqi authorities, who hope to develop it as a tourist destination.
