'''Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian''' [[Order of the Bath|KB]], (1747 &ndash; 23 November 1798) was an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] who saw service during the [[American War of Independence]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. 

Details of his early life are obscure, but he appears to have served initially in the [[English Channel]] and the [[Mediterranean]], before obtaining the rank of captain and going out to North America with Commodore [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]]. Christian was Rowley's [[flag-captain]] on {{HMS|Suffolk|1765|6}} for several years, and saw action in several of the naval engagements of the American War of the Independence. Returning to Britain at the end of the war, he spent a period without active employment, before receiving a post as second captain aboard [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Queen Charlotte|1790|6}}, during the [[Spanish Armament]]. He temporarily left her when the crisis abated, but the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars led to his return to ''Queen Charlotte''. Christian stepped down from her in 1794 to join the Transport Board, and in 1795 was promoted to rear-admiral. He was made commander-in-chief in the [[West Indies]] and given the task of transporting a large troop convoy. Twice he attempted the crossing of the Atlantic, and twice he was forced back by severe gales which ravaged his fleet and wrecked a number of the merchants in the convoy. He made a third attempt in 1796, and succeeded in shepherding the fleet to its destination. He was then active in using the troops and his naval forces to capture the islands of [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Grenada]], before returning to England. He was made second in command at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year and dying in command there in November 1798.

==Family and early life==
Christian was born in Buckingham Street, York Buildings, [[London]] in 1747, the son of Lieutenant Thomas Christian and his wife Ann.<ref name="Tracy74">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=74}}</ref><ref name="DNB278">{{cite book | chapter=Christian, Sir Hugh Cloberry (1747-1798) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1888|page=278}}</ref> He followed his father into the navy in 1761, spending time in the [[English Channel]] and the Mediterranean, but few details of his early service survive, other than that he took his lieutenant's examination in 1767, and received his commission on 21 January 1771.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="DNB278"/> He married Ann Leigh, resident of the [[Isle of Wight]] on 6 March 1775, and was promoted to master and commander in 1778.<ref name="Tracy74"/>

==American War of Independence==
Christian received a further promotion to [[flag-captain]] on 8 December 1778 and took command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Suffolk|1765|6}}, flying the broad pennant of Commodore [[Sir Joshua Rowley, 1st Baronet|Joshua Rowley]].<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="DNB278"/> Rowley sailed from [[Spithead]] on 25 December in command of a squadron of seven ships of the line, which was part of the fleet under the overall command of [[Molyneux Shuldham, 1st Baron Shuldham|Lord Shuldham]] escorting the trade convoys to the colonies. Rowley and the ''Suffolk'' were assigned to the [[West Indies]]-bound convoy.<ref name="DNB278"/><ref name="Campbell246">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval history of Great Britain|page=246}}</ref> The ''Suffolk'' arrived in the [[Leeward Islands]] on 12 February 1779, and Christian remained with Rowley in the West Indies, serving with Vice-Admiral [[John Byron]] at the [[Battle of Grenada]] on 6 July 1779.<ref name="Tracy74"/> Christian led the van of the British attack, and the ''Suffolk'' lost seven killed and 25 wounded.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell246"/> Byron returned to England after this, being replaced by Rear-Admiral [[Sir Hyde Parker, 5th Baronet|Hyde Parker]], with Rowley retaining ''Suffolk'' as his flagship.<ref name="Campbell246"/> Towards the end of 1799 intelligence reached Parker that three French ships had been sighted from [[Morne Fortune]], sailing northward. Parker sent Rowley to intercept them, and after chasing them for several hours, all three were captured.<ref name="Campbell246"/> They were revealed to be the 42-gun ''Fortun<U+00E9>e'', the 36-gun ''Blanche'' and the 28-gun ''Ellis'', with all three being added to the Royal Navy.<ref name="Campbell246"/>

Christian was again in action on 18 December, helping to capture and destroy a large French convoy off [[Martinique]], and took part in the [[Battle of Martinique (1780)|engagements off Martinique]] under [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]] in April 1780.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell246"/> Over the three engagements that took place, ''Suffolk'' lost one man killed, and 33 wounded.<ref name="Campbell247">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval history of Great Britain|page=247}}</ref> Rowley shifted his flag to the 74-gun {{HMS|Conqueror|1773|6}} after these clashes, and Christian was transferred to command the 38-gun {{HMS|Fortunee|1779|6}}, the frigate he had helped to capture in 1779.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell247"/><ref name="Winfield215">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail: 1714&ndash;1792 |page=215}}</ref> He was present at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]] on 5 September 1781, after which he returned to the West Indies.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="DNB278"/> He and ''Fortunee'' formed part of [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Sir Samuel Hood's]] fleet, with Christian being present at the [[Battle of St. Kitts]] on 25 and 26 January 1782, attached to the centre division.<ref name="DNB278"/><ref name="Campbell247"/> He was still with Rodney's fleet when the [[Battle of the Saintes]] was fought against the [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]] on 9 to 12 April 1782.<ref name="DNB278"/><ref name="Campbell247"/>

==End of the war==
Christian sailed north from [[Jamaica]] on 21 July 1782 with Admiral [[Hugh Pigot (Royal Navy officer)|Hugh Pigot's]] fleet, arriving at [[New York]] on 5 September.<ref name="Campbell247"/> Returning to [[Port Royal]] with Hood's fleet in February the following year, he spent several months cruising in the area.<ref name="Campbell247"/> He returned to England with Hood in April 1783, and left active service following the end of the war with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. He presumably did not receive any further employment until the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790, when he is recorded as being appointed as second captain aboard [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Queen Charlotte|1790|6}}.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell247"/><ref name="Winfield8">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail: 1714&ndash;1792 |page=8}}</ref> The easing of tensions meant that ''Queen Charlotte'' was paid off at the end of the year, and Christian again found himself without a ship.<ref name="Campbell247"/>

==French Revolutionary Wars==
The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in early 1793 provided Christian with further employment. ''Queen Charlotte'' was recommissioned, and he again became her second captain, still under Lord Howe.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell247"/> He stepped down from his post in August the following year, becoming a commissioner of the Transport Board, and on 1 June 1795 he was advanced to rear-admiral of the blue.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell248">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval history of Great Britain|page=248}}</ref> He was then appointed commander-in-chief of the West Indies station, and was instructed to take a fleet out with a convoy of transports, carrying soldiers for operations against the French and Dutch colonies there.<ref name="Campbell248"/> He duly hoisted his flag aboard the 98-gun {{HMS|Prince George|1772|6}} and assembled his squadron and the transports, numbering over two hundred merchants carrying 16,000 men, and making up the largest troop convoy to leave England to that date.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell248"/><ref name="Winfield22">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail: 1714&ndash;1792 |page=22}}</ref> 

===Attempts to cross the Atlantic===
The fleet did not leave Spithead until 16 November, the departure having been delayed until late in the season.<ref name="DNB278"/><ref name="Campbell248"/> The delay proved disastrous, two days after departing, a westerly gale blew up, dispersing the fleet and driving the ships back to port. Several of the merchants were wrecked with heavy loss of life; over 200 bodies were washed up on the coastline between [[Isle of Portland|Portland]] and [[Bridport]].<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell248"/>

Christian shifted his flag to the 90-gun {{HMS|Glory|1788|6}}, after deeming the ''Prince George'' to be too badly damaged to take to sea, and after having gathered his fleet again, set sail on another attempt to cross the Atlantic on 9 December.<ref name="Campbell248"/><ref name="Winfield24">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail: 1714&ndash;1792 |page=24}}</ref> Again the ships encountered severe gales that caused severe damage, forcing nine of the warships and fifty of the merchants to struggle back to port on 29 January. Some successfully made the crossing, while others were wrecked, or captured by enemy ships.<ref name="Tracy74"/><ref name="Campbell248"/> The storms were afterwards alluded to as 'Christian's Gales'.<ref name="Richardson127">{{cite book |last=Richardson|title=A Mariner of England|page=127}}</ref> Christian again shifted his flag, this time to the 74-gun {{HMS|Thunderer|1783|6}} while he waited for repairs to his ships to be completed, and the merchants gathered to make a third attempt to reach the West Indies.<ref name="Campbell249">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval history of Great Britain|page=249}}</ref> While ashore he was invested as a [[Order of the Bath|Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 17 February 1796, and on 20 March he left Spithead again, bound for the West Indies.<ref name="Campbell249"/><ref name="Tracy75">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=75}}</ref> The third voyage was successful, and he arrived at [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados]] on 21 April.<ref name="Campbell249"/><ref name="DNB279">{{cite book | chapter=Christian, Sir Hugh Cloberry (1747-1798) | title=Dictionary of National Biography|year=1888|page=279}}</ref> He joined with the forces of the station's current commander, [[John Laforey|Sir John Laforey]] several days later, and took over the command from him.<ref name="Campbell249"/><ref name="DNB279"/> Christian assembled his forces, and on 26 April sailed to invade [[St Lucia]], with a detachment of troops under Lieutenant-General [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]].<ref name="Campbell249"/> The invasion was successful and the island was surrendered to the British on 25 May.<ref name="DNB279"/> Christian went on to use his naval forces to support the reduction and capture of the islands of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Grenada]].<ref name="Campbell249"/><ref name="DNB279"/>

==Later years==
Christian was succeeded as commander in the West Indies by Rear-Admiral [[Henry Harvey]], who had arrived in late June, and Christian returned to England in October aboard {{HMS|Beaulieu|1791|6}}.<ref name="Campbell249"/> He was advanced to rear-admiral of the white on 20 February 1797, and was appointed as second in command of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] station later in the year and duly sailed to take up he post on the 44-gun [[French frigate Virginie (1794)|HMS ''Virginie'']].<ref name="DNB279"/><ref name="Campbell250">{{cite book |last=Campbell |title=Naval history of Great Britain|page=250}}</ref> He succeeded Admiral [[Thomas Pringle (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Pringle]] as the station commander in 1798, but died on 23 November that year at the age of 51.<ref name="Tracy75"/> His wife, who had been seriously ill for sometime, died two months later, without having heard of her husband's death.<ref name="Tracy75"/><ref name="Campbell250"/> Hugh Cloberry Christian had been created a peer, but died before news reached him.<ref name="Tracy75"/> He was buried at the Cape.<ref name="Campbell250"/> Of the two sons and three daughters he had had with his wife, one became a rear-admiral, [[Hood Hanaway Christian]].<ref name="Tracy75"/>
