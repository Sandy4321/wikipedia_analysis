'''Shaun Edward Alexander''' (born [[August 30]], [[1977]] in {{city-state|Florence|Kentucky}}) is an [[American football]] [[running back]] for the [[Washington Redskins]] of the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the Seahawks 19th overall in the [[2000 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]].

In the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], Alexander broke out by setting several records and was named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL's Most Valuable Player]] en route to a [[Super Bowl XL]] appearance with the Seahawks. Following several injury-plagued seasons, hindering his productivity, Alexander was released by the Seahawks in April 2008.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d807e8d82| title=Seahawks cut ties with all-time leading rusher Alexander| publisher=[[NFL]].com| date=2008-04-23| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3361271| title=Seahawks release former league MVP Alexander| publisher=ESPN| date=2008-04-23| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

==Early career==
Alexander was born and raised in [[Florence, Kentucky]], a suburb outside of [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. In 1991, he entered [[Boone County High School]]. As a freshman, he played football for the [[junior varsity]] team and was voted [[Class President]]<U+2014>as he was every year in high school.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.seahawks.com/Community/CommunityPrograms.aspx?id=36770| title=Shaun Alexander - Taking Action to Make My Community a Better Place to Live| publisher=Seattle Seahawks| author=Alexander, Shaun| date=2002-10-04| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In his sophomore season, he was made the varsity team as the second-string running back. By mid-season, he was the team's featured running back as he rushed for 1,095&nbsp;yards and fourteen touchdowns.

During his junior season in 1993, Alexander ran for 2,396&nbsp;yards and forty<U+2013>two touchdowns as Boone County made it to the state semifinals. In a game versus [[Campbell County High School (Alexandria, Kentucky)|Campbell County]], Alexander rushed for seven touchdowns. He was listed in "Faces in the Crowd" section of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in January 1994.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1004711/index.htm| title=Faces in the Crowd| publisher=''Sports Illustrated''| date=2004-01-10| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

In 1994, in his senior season, Alexander rushed for 3,166&nbsp;yards and a state record fifty<U+2013>four touchdowns<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.khsaa.org/records/football/statefootballindividualrecords.pdf| title=KHSAA state football records| format=PDF| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> and was named [[Kentucky Mr. Football Award|Kentucky's "Mr. Football"]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kfca.info/mrFootball.html| title=Mr. Football| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In three varsity seasons, Alexander rushed for 6,657&nbsp;yards and 110 touchdowns<U+2014>both of which are Top 10 prep all-time records.

==College career==
[[Image:NCAA Football 2001 Coverart.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Alexander was featured on the cover of [[NCAA Football series#NCAA Football 2001|NCAA Football 2001]].]]
Following graduation from Boone County in 1995, Alexander accepted a [[scholarship]] from [[Gene Stallings]], head coach for the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] team. In his freshman season on campus, Alexander was [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]]ed.

In his first season, as a redshirt freshman, Alexander rushed for a school-record 291&nbsp;yards<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1999/09/30/bama_alexander/| title=Alexander gives Alabama something else to think about| publisher=''Sports Illustrated''| date=1999-09-30| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> and four touchdowns in a 28<U+2013>0 victory over rivals [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lsusports.net/src/data/lsu/assets/docs/fb/96stats/ls110996.htm?DB_OEM_ID=5200| title=Alabama vs LSU (Nov. 9, 1996)| date=1996-11-09| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

Following his junior season, Alexander decided to return for his senior season rather than leaving early for the NFL. After initially being given [[Heisman Trophy]] consideration to start the season,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/1999/spring/news/1999/04/08/alabama_spring/| title=Tide to begin Heisman campaign for Alexander at A-Day| publisher=''Sports Illustrated''| date=1999-04-08| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> those hopes would fade as the season progressed and ended with a sprained ankle versus [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]]. Alexander still played a key role in leading the Tide to the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] Championship in 1999, with his game-winning 25<U+2013>yard touchdown run against #3-ranked [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] in overtime. In the fourth quarter of the 1999 [[Iron Bowl]] versus rivals [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]], Alexander led a comeback as he scored three rushing touchdowns in the 28<U+2013>17 victory, finishing the game with 199 total yards.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/1999-2000/bama11.html| title=Alabama vs Auburn (Nov 20, 1999)| publisher=RollTide.com| date=1999-11-20| accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Seattle Seahawks===
====2000<U+2013>2004====
Alexander was drafted in the [[2000 NFL Draft]] in the first round as the nineteenth overall pick. The Seahawks acquired the pick in the draft following a trade that sent wide receiver [[Joey Galloway]] to the [[Dallas Cowboys]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000213&slug=4004575| title=Seahawks land 2 top picks for Galloway| publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''| date=2000-02-13| accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> In his [[rookie]] season, Alexander saw limited action behind starter [[Ricky Watters]], rushing for just 313&nbsp;yards and two touchdowns.

In Alexander's second season in the NFL, he became the Seahawks featured running back, following injuries and eventual retirement of Watters. Alexander rushed for 1,318&nbsp;yards and fourteen touchdowns, only behind [[Marshall Faulk]] for total touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats;jsessionid=82F6736109D9000929592B0F8234453D?season=2001&seasonType=REG&d-447263-o=2&tabSeq=0&statisticCategory=TOUCHDOWNS&d-447263-p=1&d-447263-s=TOUCHDOWNS_TOTAL&d-447263-n=1| title=NFL Stats: by Player Category| publisher=NFL.com| accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> The offensive line was led by [[Pro Bowl]]er [[Walter Jones (American football)|Walter Jones]] and rookie [[Steve Hutchinson (American football)|Steve Hutchinson]]. On November 11, 2001, versus [[AFC West]] rivals [[Oakland Raiders]], Alexander rushed for a franchise record 266&nbsp;yards on thirty-five carries.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=211111026| title=Alexander's 266 yards sets Seattle single-game record| publisher=ESPN| date=2001-11-01| accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref>

In 2002, he started all 16 games en route to an [[National Football Conference|NFC]] leading (and franchise record) 16 rushing touchdowns, four of which came in the first half of Seattle's September 29, 2002 game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] where he also caught a touchdown pass. The five touchdowns in that half set an NFL record.

2003 was another productive year for Alexander. He rushed his way to a career high of 1,435 rushing yards and scored 16 touchdowns. Seattle also made its first playoff appearance since 2000. Alexander's success in the 2003 season earned him his first trip to [[Honolulu]] for the annual [[Pro Bowl]].

In 2004, Alexander remained one of the key components of Seattle's offense. He finished second in the NFL in rushing yards (with 1,696) to the [[New York Jets]]' [[Curtis Martin]] by a single yard. After being passed over for a late game rushing attempt during his team's victory over the [[Atlanta Falcons]], Alexander accused his coach [[Mike Holmgren]] of "stabbing him in the back" by denying Alexander an opportunity to win the rushing title. Alexander retracted his comments the following day, and expressed support for his coach.

====2005 season====
Alexander had a great deal of success in the 2005 season. In the first game, he rushed for 73 yards. Other highlights include an 88-yard touchdown run against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on November 6, 2005, and rushing for 165 yards against the [[St. Louis Rams]] on November 13, 2005. Also, he had two 4 touchdown games, against Arizona on September 25, 2005, and against the [[Houston Texans]] on October 16, 2005. He led the NFL in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, [[Pro Bowl]] votes, and points.

During the 2005 season he broke the franchise record for the most rushing yards in the Seattle Seahawks' history. On November 13, 2005, scoring 3 touchdowns, Alexander became the first running back in NFL history to record 15 or more touchdowns in five consecutive seasons. On November 20, 2005, in San Francisco, Alexander became the first player in NFL history to score 19 rushing or receiving TDs in only 10 games ([[Steve Van Buren]] had 18 in 1945). This feat eventually led to him breaking [[Priest Holmes]] record of 27 total touchdowns set in 2002, and his 27 rushing touchdowns also tied Holmes for the most in a single season.

On December 11, 2005, in Seattle's [[NFC West]]-clinching victory over the [[San Francisco 49ers]], Alexander had his 9th 100<U+2013>yard rushing game of the year, breaking [[Chris Warren (football player)|Chris Warren]]'s franchise record of eight 100<U+2013>yard games. In the process he also set a more significant NFL record, running for 100 yards against divisional opponents in nine straight games, a record previously held by [[Walter Payton]]. On December 18th, 2005, in a game against the [[Tennessee Titans]], Alexander passed the 1,600 yard mark for the second consecutive season, had a Seahawks franchise record 10th 100 yard rushing game, and scored his 24th rushing touchdown of the year (as well as the 86th of his career, tying him with Priest Holmes at 12th on the all-time rushing touchdown leader list).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/alltime/leaders?cat=carrushtd ESPN - NFL All-Time Leaders - National Football League<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Perhaps more substantial is that his 96th career touchdown moved him into an 18th place tie with [[Randy Moss]] and [[Eric Dickerson]] on the all-time touchdown leader list<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/alltime/leaders?cat=touchdown ESPN - NFL All-Time Leaders - National Football League<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, having already bumped Priest Holmes (94 TDs) into 21st. Alexander also became the first Seahawks player to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

On [[January 1]], [[2006]], in a game versus the [[Green Bay Packers]], Alexander set the single season touchdown record at 28, and tied Priest Holmes's record of 27 rushing touchdowns in a season. Alexander also won his first NFL rushing title with 1,880 rushing yards. In 2005, he joined [[Emmitt Smith]], [[Priest Holmes]], and [[Marshall Faulk]] as the only running backs to record consecutive seasons of 20 or more touchdowns.

Four days later, on [[January 5]], he was awarded with the 2005 [[National Football League MVP|NFL MVP Award]], becoming the first Seahawk to win the MVP award in franchise history. He beat out [[New York Giants]] running back [[Tiki Barber]] and [[Indianapolis Colts]] quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] who had won the award the previous two years. Alexander garnered 19 out of a possible 50 votes. A day after receiving the MVP award, Alexander was named [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award|Associated Press Offensive Player of the Year]]. He received 34 votes of a panel of 50 NFL sportwriters and broadcasters. He was also named the [[FedEx Corporation|FedEx]] Ground [[National Football League|NFL]] Player of the Year. At the [[ESPY Awards]] Alexander received two awards, Best Record Breaking Performance and Best NFL Player.

In the 2006 Divisional playoff game against the [[Washington Redskins]] Alexander suffered a [[Concussion of the brain|concussion]] early on and had to watch the rest of the game, a Seahawks win, from the sidelines. However, in the [[NFC Championship Game]] against the [[Carolina Panthers]] he had 34 carries for 132 yards and two touchdowns, which was easily the best playoff performance of his career.

Shaun Alexander and the Seahawks lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in [[Super Bowl XL]] on February 5, 2006. Alexander was the leading rusher of the game with 95 yards. He suffered a [[sprained]] ankle towards the end of the game which kept him from playing in the [[Pro Bowl]]. At the end of the season, he was selected to be the cover athlete of ''[[Madden NFL 2007]]''. To date, Alexander is the only player that has been featured on both the covers of ''Madden NFL'' and [[NCAA Football 2001|''NCAA Football'']].

====2006 season====
In March 2006 Alexander signed an eight year, $62&nbsp;million contract to remain a part of the Seattle Seahawks organization, becoming the highest paid running back in NFL history at the time of the signing. However, the Seahawks lost perennial All-Pro offensive guard Steve Hutchinson in free agency, weakening the offensive line that had been so integral to the running back's productivity.

Alexander's success in the 2005 season led to his being featured on the cover of [[Madden NFL|Madden NFL 07]] making him the first player to appear on the covers of both EA Sports football titles. Alexander previously appeared on the cover of NCAA Football 2001. Alexander fractured his toe in his left foot in Week 3 of the season, keeping the [[Madden NFL#Madden curse|Madden curse]] alive. That same game, he set a team record when he scored his 102nd touchdown of his career with the Seattle Seahawks which broke Steve Largent's record. He returned to action on November 19, 2006 against the San Francisco 49ers. On December 10, in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals, he broke [[Barry Sanders]] record for most consecutive games with a run of 10 or more yards.

Alexander's final regular season statistics for 2006 were 896 rushing yards on 252 attempts, (3.6 yards per carry) with seven touchdowns, all rushing TDs, in 10 games.

====2007 season====
The retirement of Pro Bowl center [[Robbie Tobeck]] further enfeebled the Seahawks' once-dominant offensive line, further contributing to the diminution of Alexander's productivity.

During Week 1's game against [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers| Tampa Bay]] , Alexander sustained a fractured left wrist. Alexander assured coaches and the press that he would still continue to play. Although Alexander decided to play despite his injury, his performance had taken a noticeable turn for the worse. During Week 5, Alexander's lead blocker, [[Mack Strong]], was injured with a herniated disk in his neck, forcing him to retire; he was replaced by [[Leonard Weaver]]. Injuries plagued Alexander again during Week 9, where he twisted both his knee and ankle. In the final game of the regular season, Alexander became the eighth player in [[NFL]] history to score 100 rushing touchdowns.

Alexander's final regular season statistics for 2007 were 716 yards rushing on 207 attempts, a 3.5<U+2013>yard per carry with four touchdowns in 10 games. He added 14 receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown to his rushing totals.

Alexander recorded only 20 yards on 9 carries and scored a TD on a one-yard run in Seattle's playoff loss to the Green Bay Packers on January 12, 2008.

===Washington Redskins===
After being released by the Seahawks on Apri 22, 2008, Alexander visited several teams including the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Detroit Lions]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/16/Redskins-Alexander/| title=Alexander aims to show he can play| publisher=''Washington Times''| last=Elfin| first=David| date=2008-10-16| accessdate=2008-10-16}}</ref> Following the visits without any contract offers, Alexander stated that signing with a team was imminent and had no plans to retire soon.{{fact|date=October 2008}}

After a visit to the [[Washington Redskins]] on October 14, 2008, the team signed Alexander<ref>{{cite web| url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iaEXT_ulM_zb8TErfCjjT67qy4cw| title=Redskins ink former MVP Alexander| publisher=Associated Press| date=2008-10-14| accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> after back-up running back [[Ladell Betts]] went down with a knee injury.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/redskinsinsider/2008/10/betts_injury_not_serious.html| title=Betts' Injury Not Serious| publisher=''Washington Post''| date=2008-10-13| accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref>
