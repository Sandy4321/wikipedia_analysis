'''Paddywhack''' (also spelt '''Paddywack''') or '''[[Nuchal ligament]]''' (Latin: '''''Ligamentum nuchae'''''), is a strong elastic [[ligament]] in the midline of the neck of [[sheep]] or [[cattle]] which relieves the animal of the weight of its head.  It is pale yellow in colour. (The yellow colour is the elastin on the ligaments.)  The name is derived from the corruption of ''paxwax'' (originally ''faxwax'' Old English ''hair'' + ''to grow'').

The nuchal ligament is unusual in being a ligament with an elastic component, allowing for stretch. Most ligaments are mostly made of highly aligned [[collagen]] fibres which do not permit stretching.

==Usage==
It is eaten in several countries.  It is high in protein (78%), fat (10%), crude fibre (0.7%), and crude ash (1%).  The meat is taken from domestic cattle, the bison, African buffalo, the water buffalo, the yak, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes.{{fact|date=September 2011}}  

Dried paddywhack is commonly packaged and sold as a dog treat.

==In popular culture==
It is referred to in the children's [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[This Old Man]]''.
