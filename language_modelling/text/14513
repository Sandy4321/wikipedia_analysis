'''New York State Route 217''' (NY&nbsp;217) is a short {{convert|6.78|mi|adj=on}} [[state highway]] in [[New York]], running from the hamlet of [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]] to the town of [[Ghent, New York|Ghent]] in [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]]. NY 217 is the only state highway to pass through the village of [[Philmont, New York|Philmont]]. Route 217 passes through a majority of low-density populations. After the [[Taconic State Parkway]] intersection in Ghent, Route 217 continues as '''Columbia County Route 21C''' and after a while, '''County Route 21''', all the way to an intersection with [[New York State Route 22]] in [[North Hillsdale, New York|North Hillsdale]].

Route 217 was originally assigned an extended alignment from a ferry alignment south of the city of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] to NY 22 in North Hillsdale. Route 217 remained intact on that alignment for a few years, and by 1937, Route 217 was truncated back to its current termini. The route was later part of the construction of the Taconic Parkway in Columbia County during the 1950s and early 1960s. 

== Route description ==

=== NY 217 ===
NY&nbsp;217 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 23]] in the community of [[Claverack, New York]] and hamlet of [[Red Mills, New York]]. The route heads northward off the intersection, passing through a short patch of woodlands and soon turning to the northeast. At an intersection with Courts Lane, Route 217 passes by a small residential area. The route progresses its way northward, passing a large field to the south and more residential homes to the north. The route passes a large farm before making another turn to the northeast.<ref name="yahoo217">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.258907&lon=-73.607232&zoom=17&q1=42.224809%2C-73.715572&q2=42.250228%2C-73.646564&q3=42.257343%2C-73.612918|title=Overview map of NY 217|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Incorporated|year=2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> 

At an intersection with Roxbury Road, Route 217 passes the [[Columbia Golf and Country Club]] to the west. North of the populous country club, there is an intersection with Tishauser Road, a dead-end local highway. Route 217 turns itself to the northeast once again, passing a local school and its baseball fields. After an intersection with Coons Road, a local road that ends at a cul-de-sac, the highway crosses into the community of [[Mellenville, New York]]. <ref name="yahoo217" />

In Mellenville, which is not highly populated, Route 217 continues northward, through woodlands and a few residential developments. In the center of Mellenville, Route 217 intersects with [[County Route 18 (Columbia County, New York)|Columbia County Route 18]] (Fish and Game Road). After CR 18, the highway makes a turn to the northeast, and after leaving Mellenville, Route 217 begins a journey through dense woodlands. At an intersection with Gabhuer Road, the highway makes a series of bends, heading in a general eastward direction.<ref name="yahoo217" /> 

In the new populous area that Route 217 enters, the highway intersects with [[County Route 9 (Columbia County, New York)|Columbia County Route 9]] (Mellenville Road), with the main road serving as CR 9's southern terminus. The highway begins to make its way southward, passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north and nearby Claverack Town Park. Route 217 makes several bends to the southeast, and eventually to the east, entering the community of [[Philmont, New York]].<ref name="yahoo217" />

In Philmont, Route 217 heads along a series of bends, filled with residential homes. The first intersection, along one of the bends, is the northern terminus of Roxbury Road (which also intersected Route 217 back near the country club). After Roxbury Road, Route 217 intersects with more local streets, passing by an even more dense development of residential homes. At an intersection with Maple Street, the highway passes to the northeast of [[Summit Lake (New York)|Summit Lake]]. Route 217 makes its way to the northeast again, and at an intersection with [[County Route 11 (Columbia County, New York)|Columbia County Route 11]], the highway leaves Philmont.<ref name="yahoo217" />

After Philmont, Route 217 progresses its way northward, with the highway winding its way through dense woods. There is a short break for a small commercial development. After another set of woods, Route 217 passes through fields and turns eastward, eventually ending up in the final set of woods along the state highway. After an intersection with Shnackenberg Road, the highway turns to the southeast. After that Route 217 approaches the Partial Cloverleaf interchange with the [[Taconic State Parkway]]. About {{convert|800|ft|m}} after the Taconic interchange, Route 217 ends and continues as Columbia County Route 21C.<ref name="yahoo217" />

=== CR 21C ===
At the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;217, the highway continues to the northeast under the maintenance of [[Columbia County, New York]]. The route heads through several bends, paralleling the northbound Taconic State Parkway, which is nearby. At a patch of forests, Route 21C (the county designation) passes through the fields surrounding the area. In a small patch of woodlands, Route 21C turns to the northeast, intersecting with May Hill Road, a dead-end local highway.<ref name="yahoo21C">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.273357&lon=-73.592748&zoom=17&q1=42.257343%2C-73.612918&q2=42.272595%2C-73.591976|title=Overview map of County Route 21C|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Incorporated|year=2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref>

After May Hill Road, Route 21C passes through a short set of fields. Heading northward, Route 21C heads its way into the community of Harlemville. Entering Harlemville, from a short patch of woods, the highway heads through the less dense community, with just a few residential homes surrounding the highway. Just north of Harlemville, Route 21C terminates at an intersection with its parent route, County Route 21 and Harlemville Road, a local road.<ref name="yahoo21C" />

=== CR 21 ===
After the termination of County Route 21C north of Harlemville, Route 21 (which terminated at the same intersection), begins its way eastward from Harlemville. The route, as it progresses eastward, heads through several different regions, some woodlands, some fields, and some residential developments. The first four-way intersection along this stretch since Philmont occurs at an intersection with Harlemville Road, which heads to the south, and Cool Timber Road, a dead-end highway to the north.<ref name="yahoo21">{{cite map|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=42.239879&lon=-73.50593&zoom=16&q1=42.272595%2C-73.591976&q2=42.257986%2C-73.538739&q3=42.234668%2C-73.507368|title=Overview map of County Route 21|publisher=Yahoo Maps|cartography=NAVTEQ Incorporated|year=2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref>

After a short distance, County Route 21 intersects with [[County Route 7 (Columbia County, New York)|County Route 7]] (Crow Hill Road), which heads northward from Route 21. After the County Route 7 intersection, Route 21 gains the name '''Cakeout Turnpike'''. After an intersection with Pheasant Lane, the highway begins to make several bends through a densely-wooded area. After a bend, Route 21 intersects with Schoolhouse Road, a local road that heads northward.<ref name="yahoo21" /> 

As the route turns to the southeast, heading through the woodlands, Route 21 intersects with Caso Lane, a short dead-end highway, and Gellert Road, a local road that heads northward. After an intersection with Dawson Road, Route 21 turns to the southeast, intersecting with Hunt Road. At that intersection, there is a short development of community. A short distance later, Route 21 enters the community of [[North Hillsdale, New York]], where the highway splits and terminates at an intersection with [[New York State Route 22]].<ref name="yahoo21" />

== History ==
When Route 217 was originally assigned in the [[1930 New York State Route renumbering]] on January 30, 1930,<ref name="1930renum">{{cite news |author=Leon A. Dickinson |title=New Signs for State Highways |work=[[New York Times]] |date=January 12, 1930 |page=136}}</ref> it was extended southward from Claverack, following a concurrency with New York State Route 23 to an intersection with [[New York State Route 9H]], where it turned along 9H. At an intersection near [[Hollowville, New York]], Route 217 turned eastward, leaving Route 9H behind, intersecting with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]]. After that, it went eastward to the south of the city of [[Hudson, New York]]. The highway terminated at a ferry route from Hudson to [[Catskill, New York]].<ref name="1933map">{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |publisher=[[Texas Oil Company]] |year=1933 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref>

The extension of NY 217 remained intact for a few years, and by 1937, Route 217 had been truncated to its southern terminus at an intersection with New York State Route 23.<ref name="1937map">{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company]] |year=1937 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> Also, during the 1930 renumbering, Route 217 extended farther eastward from the present location of the Taconic State Parkway. Route 217 continued along the county-maintained segment for several miles, terminating at an intersection with Route 22, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of an intersection with [[New York State Route 71]].<ref name="1930renum"/><ref name="1933map"/> Also, by 1937, Route 217 had been truncated to the current northern terminus of CR 21C, Harlemville Road.<ref name="1937map"/> When the partial cloverleaf interchange with the Taconic was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, it caused a minor realignment.<ref name="nycroads">{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/taconic/|title=Taconic State Parkway|last=Anderson|first=Steve|date=2009|publisher=NYCRoads|pages=1|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref> For several decades, NY 217 remained intact along this alignment.<ref name="1970log">{{cite book |url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf |title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State |date=January 1, 1970 |author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]] |format=PDF |accessdate=}}</ref> In 1980, during maintenance swap between the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] and the county of Columbia, the state relinquished a portion of NY 217 (from the Taconic interchange to Harlemville Road) to the county,<ref name="law">{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> which was replaced by County Route 21C, a right-of-way spur of County Route 21.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=v50|title=Chatam, NY Quadrangle|publisher=[[NYSDOT]]|year=1995|accessdate=April 12, 2009}}</ref> There have been no alignment changes since.<ref name="2008map">{{cite map|title=New York State Map|publisher=[[I Love New York]]|year=2008|cartography=Map Works Inc.}}</ref>
