'''Robert de Bethune''' (or '''Robert de Betun''' or '''Robert de B<U+00E9>thune'''<ref name=Green160>Green ''Government of England Under Henry I p. 160</ref>)  (died 1148) was a medieval [[Bishop of Hereford]]. The son of a knight, he became a teacher before becoming a [[canon (priest)|canon]], a type of monk, by 1115. He was elected [[prior]] of [[Llanthony Priory]] in the middle 1120s, and was named bishop by King [[Henry I of England]] in 1130. As bishop, he was often appointed a judge by the papacy, and was known for the care he took of his diocese. 

After Henry's death in 1135, Bethune first supported King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]], who seized the throne from Henry's heiress [[Empress Matilda]], but when Matilda's forces captured Stephen, Bethune switched sides to support Matilda. When Matilda did not secure the throne, Bethune once more switched back to supporting Stephen. Construction of [[Hereford Cathedral]] was completed under Bethune's episcopate, and consecrated in 1142 and 1148. Stephen appointed Bethune as one of the English bishops that the king allowed to attend the [[Council of Rheims]] in 1148, and Bethune died there in April 1148. A [[hagiography]] is the only surviving evidence of Bethune's [[cathedral chapter]]'s attempts to promote him as a saint.

==Early life==
Bethune was the youngest son of a knight, and was at first educated by his eldest brother,<ref name=Church229>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154 p. 229</ref> who was named Gunfrid and was a schoolmaster. Although the medieval chronicler [[Robert de Torigni]] describes Bethune as Flemish, Bethune's medieval biographer, [[William Wyncombe]] says that he and Bethune grew up in neighboring villages in Buckinghamshire. It thus is likely that Bethune was born near Wingrave, Buckinghamshire, to a family descended from Flemish settlers.<ref name= DNB>Barrow "B<U+00E9>thune, Robert de (d. 1148)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> He was a schoolmaster in England, teaching elementary subjects,<ref name=Church229/> before he went to study theology under [[William of Champeaux]] and [[Anselm of Laon]].<ref name=ANE128>Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 128</ref><ref name=Church249>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' pp. 249<U+2013>50</ref> He was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Llanthony Priory]] before 1115, and was elected [[prior]] of that house in the middle 1120s.<ref name= BHOHereford>Barrow ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34422 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 8: Hereford: Bishops]''</ref> Before becoming prior, he was entrusted with establishing a cell of the priory at Weobley, which had been established by Hugh de Lacy shortly before Lacy's death around 1115.<ref name=DNB/>

==Bishop of Hereford==

The see of Hereford had been vacant since 1127, and in 1130, the king [[Henry I of England]] took the advice of the local magnates and nominated Bethune to the see.<ref name=Brett105>Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' p. 105</ref> Bethune's diocesan bishop as prior, [[Urban (bishop)|Urban]], [[bishop of Llandaff]], at first refused permission for Bethune's elevation. However, the archbishop of Canterbury, [[William of Corbeil]], advised that the matter be referred to the papacy.<ref name=Brett53>Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' pp. 53&ndash;55</ref>  [[Pope Innocent II]] ordered that Bethune be allowed to accept the [[see of Hereford]] in 1131.<ref name=BHOHereford/> He was consecrated on 28 June 1131<ref name=Handbook250>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 250</ref> at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]].<ref name=BHOHereford/> In nominating Bethune, the king is said to have felt that he needed one "godly bishop" around.<ref name=Brett112>Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' p. 112</ref> Most of Henry's bishops were given their sees as rewards for royal service, and were not particularly noted for piety.<ref name=Brett105>Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' pp. 105-111</ref>

Bethune was known as a strict [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Canon (priest)|canon]], a priest living a monastic life but not a monk. Bethune was often appointed a judge delegate by the papacy to try cases and disputes, which had been referred back to England by the popes.<ref name=Monastic253>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 253</ref> The historian [[David Knowles]] said of Bethune that he was a man of wide outlook, with a great desire for reform.<ref name=Monastic297>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 297</ref> He was praised by contemporaries for the care with which he selected men to serve as clergy in his diocese.<ref name=Brett119>Brett ''English Church Under Henry I'' pp. 119&ndash;120</ref> He also held synods in his diocese, including two during the first year of his episcopate.<ref name=DNB/>

==Stephen's reign==

After the accession of King [[Stephen of England]], Bethune supported Stephen and was often at his court.<ref name=DNB/> Stephen had seized the throne at King Henry's death, depriving Henry's suriving legitimate daughter and heiress, Matilda, of the throne. Matilda is usually known as the "Empress" because of her first marriage to the German Emperor [[Henry V]], who died in 1125.<ref name=Ruling71>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 71-74</ref> When the Empress Matilda landed in England in September 1139 in pursuit of the throne, one of the local magnates of Hereford, [[Miles de Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford|Miles of Gloucester]] supported Matilda, while Bethune continued to support Stephen. Miles' hostility drove Bethune from his diocese, and Miles was in control of Hereford in 1140, leaving Bethune to perform his episcopal duties in Shropshire.<ref name=DNB/> During this time, Bethune assisted [[Theobald of Bec]], the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], in consecrating [[Meurig (bishop)|Maurice]] as [[Bishop of Bangor]]. Bethune had earlier persuaded the bishop-elect to swear fealty to King Stephen, after Maurice had originally refused. Bethune's standing as a bishop known for his piety and independence of the king helped persuade Maurice that the homage was canonical.<ref name=Theo92>Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref>

Sometime after Stephen was captured by the Empress' forces in 1141, Bethune switched sides,<ref name=DNB/> and he was with the [[Empress Matilda]] at Winchester in 4 March 1141, when Matilda claimed the throne of England. He also was present at the council that proclaimed Matilda "lady of the English" shortly thereafter. His diocese of Hereford was in the center of the lands that Matilda controlled,<ref name=Chibnall98>Chibnall ''Empress Matilda'' pp. 98&ndash;99</ref> and he was one of the few bishops who was often in Matilda's court.<ref name=Church96>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 96}}</ref> However, Matilda was never crowned, being driven from London before her planned coronation could take place. One of her chief supporters was captured in late 1141, and in order to secure his release, Matilda released Stephen from captivity, thus prolonging the conflict. Between 1142 and 1148, England was in a state of civil war, with parts of the country supporting Matilda and parts supporting Stephen.<ref name=Ruling71/>

Welsh raids at the beginning of Stephen's reign had driven Bethune's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester. The land the canons were settled on had belonged to the diocese, and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter, led by their dean, Ralph. Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure an order from Innocent II declaring that the chapter obey their bishop.<ref name=DNB/>

Around 1142, Bethune was involved with a conflict with Miles of Gloucester, who was now the [[Earl of Hereford]], which led to the bishop excomunicating Miles and all the inhabitants of the city of Hereford, and "had the doors of the church blocked with thorns and the crosses taken down and placed on the ground".<ref name= QBartlett448>Quoted in Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 448</ref> This dispute arose over an attempt by Miles to tax the churches in his earldom, which Bethune regarded as unlawful. Miles died in 1143 which ended the dispute over the taxes. Also after his death Bethune was free to leave Empress' faction and thus returned to supporting Stephen.<ref name=DNB/> In 1142, [[Hereford Cathedral]], which had begun under [[Robert of Hereford|Robert de Losinga]] around 1079, was finally ready for consecration. The work was finally completed in 1148, and it was once consecrated in that year.<ref name=Arch226>Wischermann "Romanesque Architecture in Great Britain" ''Romanesque'' p. 226</ref> The year 1148 also saw the departure of Matilda from England, as her support had dwindled over the previous few years and Stephen was able to secure control of most of England. He was never able to completely remove Matilda's supporters, however.<ref name=Ruling75>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 75</ref> 

King Stephen gave permission for some of England's bishops, including Bethune, to attend the Council of Rheims in 1148.<ref name=Matthew199>Matthew ''King Stephen'' pp. 199&ndash;200</ref> Stephen had expelled the [[papal legate]]s, or representatives, who arrived in England to summon the bishops to Rheims, and after that appointed three of the bishops as representatives of the English Church. These three, Bethune, [[Hilary of Chichester]], and [[William de Turbeville]], were allowed to attend the council. Theobald of Bec was expressly forbidden to attend, but he managed to evade those watching him and arrived in Rheims along with his clerk, [[Thomas Becket]].<ref name=Theo25>Saltman ''Theobald'' pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>

==Death and legacy==

Bethune died on 16 April 1148<ref name=Handbook250/> at [[Rheims]] just after the close of the [[Council of Rheims]].<ref name=Crouch305>Crouch ''Reign of King Stephen'' p. 305</ref> As his corpse returned to Hereford, miracles were alleged to have taken place along its route.<ref name=Church100>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 100</ref> He was buried in Hereford Cathedral.<ref name=Boker47>Boker "Bishop's Chapel" ''Gesta'' p. 47</ref> 

A ''Life'', giving his life and miracles, was written about him,<ref name=Church23>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 23</ref> and was written by one of the Bethune's canons, William Wyncombe.<ref name=Church88/><ref name= Bartlett461>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 461&ndash;462</ref> It contains few details of Bethune's life itself. Instead, it is an attempt by his canons to secure sainthood for Bethune.<ref name=Church88>Barlow ''English Church 1066<U+2013>1154'' p. 88</ref> Although the life describes miracles that took place at Bethune's tomb, no evidence survives of a formal cult being developed, and he was never canonized.<ref name=Bartlett461/> The historian Avram Saltman called him "the model bishop of his time", because of his care for his diocese and his abilities.<ref name=Theo14>Saltman ''Theobald'' p. 14</ref>
