'''Oil shale extraction''' refers to the process in which [[kerogen]], a mixture of organic chemical compounds found in [[oil shale]]s, is converted into [[synthetic crude]] oil through the chemical process of [[pyrolysis]]. The extraction produces a [[petroleum]]-like shale oil<U+2014>a form of [[non-conventional oil]]<U+2014>and [[Combustibility|combustible]] shale gas (''[[shale gas]]'' can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale is heated in the absence of [[oxygen]] to a temperature at which kerogen is decomposed or pyrolysed into gas, [[Condensation|condensable]] oil, and a solid residue. [[Chemical decomposition|Decomposition]] begins at relatively low temperatures ({{convert|300|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|-1}}), but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperature.<ref name=koel>

</ref>  The shale oil may be used as a fuel oil or [[Upgrader|upgraded]] to meet [[oil refinery|refinery]] feed specifications by adding [[hydrogen]] and removing impurities such as [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]].  The non-condensible retort gas and [[char]] may be burnt and the heat energy may be reused for heating the raw oil shale or generating electricity.

The extraction techniques can be broadly classified into two primary methods, the ''ex situ'' method and the ''in situ'' method.  There are hundreds of patents for oil shale [[retort]]ing technologies.<ref name=patent>

==Classification of extraction technologies==

Industry analysts have created several classifications of the methods by which [[hydrocarbon]]s are extracted from oil shale. A frequently-used distinction considers whether [[Distillation|retorting]] is done above or below ground, and classifies the technologies broadly as ''ex situ'' (off site) or ''in situ'' (on site). In the ''ex situ'' process, also known as above-ground retorting, the oil shale is mined and transported to a retort facility. By contrast, the ''in situ'' method converts the kerogen while it is still in the form of an oil shale deposit; it is then extracted via a [[Oil well|well]], where it rises in the same way as conventional petroleum.  

However, based on the technique used to heat the oil shale to an appropriate temperature, its processing has also been classified into internal combustion, hot recycled solids, wall conduction, externally generated hot gas, reactive fluid, and volumetric heating methods.  There are many possible realizations and combinations of these methods; therefore the following table is representative but not complete. Some processes are difficult to classify due to their unique methods of heat input (e.g. ExxonMobil's Electrofrac) or due to limited information.<ref name=AICHE>

The heating methods used to decompose the rock may be classified as direct or indirect. Only internal combustion technologies are classified as direct - all other heating technologies are described as indirect. Based on whether gases or circulated solids are used to transfer heat, heating methods have been further divided into internal hot gas carrier technologies (e.g. internal combustion technologies and externally generated hot gas technologies) and internal hot solid carrier technologies (those using hot recycled solids to transfer heat to the oil shale and those using wall conduction).<ref name=koel/><ref name=qian/><ref name=AICHE/>   

Some analysts use the size of the oil shale particles that are fed into the retorts to differentiate the various ''ex situ'' extraction processes. As a rule, oil shale "lumps" varying in diameter from 10 to 100&nbsp;millimetres (0.4 to 4&nbsp;in) are used in internal hot gas carrier technologies, while oil shale that has been crushed into particulates less than {{convert|10|mm|in|1|disp=s}} in diameter is used in internal hot solid carrier technologies.<ref name=qian/>

==''Ex situ'' technologies==
<!-- [[Image:Stuart oil shale processing plant.jpg|thumb|Stuart oil shale pilot plant]] image hide for clarification rationale--> 
In case of the ''ex situ'' method, the oil shale is mined either by [[Underground mining (soft rock)|underground]] or [[surface mining]] and then transported to a processing facility. At the facility, the oil shale is heated, usually to 450&nbsp;<U+00B0>C to 500&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (840&nbsp;<U+00B0>F to 930&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), at which temperature the kerogen in the oil shale decomposes to gas, oil vapor and char. This process is known as retorting. The gas and oil vapors are separated from the spent shale and cooled, causing the oil to condense.

===Internal combustion technologies===
Internal combustion technologies use for the heat transfer the flowing gases, which are generated by combustion within the retort.  Common characteristics of these technologies are feeding by lump oil shale and the retort vapors are diluted with the exhaust generated by the combustion. The main technologies are Kiviter, Union A, Paraho Direct, Superior Direct, and Fushun processes.<ref name=AICHE/><ref name=assessment/>  The Kiviter processing takes place in the vertical shaft retort internally heated by combustion of coke residue (char) and non-condensable shale gas. Raw oil shale enters from the top of retort. It is heated by the rising gases, which pass sideward through the descending oil shale and carry the oil vapors and evolving gas into the collection chamber. From there the oil vapor is delivered to the condensing system. The shale residue is heated near {{convert|900|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} to burn off the char. Recycle gas entering the bottom of the retort cools the spent shale, which then leaves the retort through a water-sealed discharge system.<ref name=koel/>  Main problems associated with Kiviter process are environmental concerns such as extensive use and pollution of water in the process, as also the waste solid residue which continues to leach toxic substances.<ref name=oilshale2>

===Hot recycled solids technologies===
Hot recycled solids technologies use solid particles (usually shale ash) to carry heat in the the retorting zone. Typical characteristics of these technologies are the use of a [[rotary kiln|rotating kiln]], the feeding fine oil shale particles (less than 10&nbsp;mm, in some technologies even less than 2.5&nbsp;mm) and the heating of the heat carrier in a separate chamber or vessel, thus the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust. The main technologies in this category include Galoter, Alberta Taciuk Process (ATP), TOSCO II, Lurgi-Ruhrgas, Chevron STB, LLNL HRS, and Shell Spher processes.<ref name=AICHE/><ref name=assessment/>
 
In the Galoter (also known as TSK or SHC) processing, dried oil shale is mixed with a hot ({{convert|800|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|-1}}) solid shale ash, which is used as the heat carrier. The ash is obtained by combustion of the spent shale, burnt in a separate furnace.<ref name=soone/> The pyrolyse temperature in the Galoter retort is {{convert|520|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|-1}}.<ref name=koel/> The Galoter process is more eco-friendly than the internal combustion technologies, as the use of water and pollution caused is minimal. However, the burning residue does cause some environmental problems due to organic carbon and calcium sulfide content.<ref name=oilshale2/>  The Galoter process is used for oil production by [[Eesti Energia]], an Estonian energy company.<ref name=fossilenergy/> The company has two retorts, both processing 125&nbsp;tonnes per hour of oil shale and plans are underway to build two more. It also plans to use this technology to construct a shale oil plant in Jordan.<ref name=Estonia>

As with the Galoter and Alberta Taciuk process, the TOSCO II also processes oil shale fine particles which are heated with hot recycled solids in a rotating kiln. However, instead of recycling shale ash, the TOSCO II circulates hot ceramic balls between the retort and a heater. The process was tested in a 40&nbsp;tonnes per hour test facility near [[Parachute, Colorado]]. The test facility was shut down in 1972. The LLNL HRS (hot-recycled-solid) retorting process was developed by the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. The technology was used in a 4&nbsp;tonnes per day pilot plant from 1990 to 1993. A delayed-fall combustor, which is used in this process, gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor, used in the Lurgi-Ruhrgas process, originally developed in the 1950s in Germany by [[Lurgi AG|Lurgi Corporation]]. Another difference between the LLNL HRS and the Lurgi-Ruhrgas processes is the usage of a fluidized-bed mixer in the LLNL HRS process, instead of the screw mixer, used in the Lurgi-Ruhrgas process.<ref name=AICHE/><ref name=fossilenergy/><ref name=lee>

In the Red-Leaf Resources EcoShale In-Capsule Process, a hot gas generated by the burning of natural gas or pyrolysis gas. It is circulated through a pile of oil shale [[rubble]] using a set of parallel pipes. The heat is transferred to the shale through the pipe walls rather than being injected directly into the pile of oil shale rubble, thereby avoiding dilution of the pyrolysis gas with the heating gas. The pile of oil shale rubble is encapsulated by a low-cost earthen impoundment structure designed to prevent environmental contamination and to provide easy reclamation. Energy efficiency is enhanced by recovering heat from the spent shale by passing cool gas through the heating pipes and then using it to preheat adjacent capsules.<ref name=DOE/><ref name=redleaf>

A new process from Combustion Processes, Inc., seeks to eliminate [[carbon dioxide]] emissions from the shale oil production process. Pyrolysis occurs in a rotating kiln heated by hot gas flowing through an outer annulus. The hot gas is created by burning hydrogen generated in a separate unit by coal gasification followed by carbon dioxide separation. The annular geometry achieves heat transfer to the moving shale through a wall, thereby avoiding dilution of the product gas.<ref name=combustion>

Oil-Tech staged electrically heated retort process is developed by Millennium Synfuels, LLC (former Oil Tech Inc.). In this process, the crushed feed oil shale is lifted by a conveyor system to the vertical retort, loaded from the top. The retort is composed of a series of individual heating chambers, interconnected and stacked one upon the other. Heating rods extend into the centers of each of these chambers. The feed oil shale is heated to greater temperatures as it goes further down the retort, attaining a temperature of {{convert|1000|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|-1}} in the lowest heating chamber. The gases and vapors are vacuumed into a
condensing unit. The spent shale is used for pre-heating feed oil shale.<ref name=DOE/><ref name=BLM2008appendix>

Externally generated hot gas technologies or indirectly heated technologies use heat, transferred by gases which are heated outside the retort vessel. The main technologies are Petrosix, Union B, Paraho Indirect, and Superior Indirect processes.<ref name=AICHE/><ref name=assessment/> As with the internal combustion technologies, most of the externally-generated hot gas technologies process oil shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns; however, the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust.

</ref> The largest retort ever built used the Union B technology, developed by [[Unocal Corporation|Unocal]]. The Union B processed 400&nbsp;tonnes per hour of oil shale lumps heated by externally generated hot gas. However, unlike all other vertical shaft kilns, the Union B pumped the oil shale into the bottom of the retort, with the hot gas entering at the top.  Unocal operated the retort from 1986 to 1992 near Parachute, Colorado. The Paraho Indirect technology is similar to the Petrosix which is considered a highly reliable technology for use with U.S. oil shale.<ref name=fossilenergy/>  

Two companies, Syntec Energy and Western Energy Partners, have proposed new hot gas processes based on linking coal gasification with rotating kiln retorts.  The hot, hydrogen-rich [[synthesis gas]] from the coal gasifier is fed into the rotating kiln in direct contact with the oil shale, thereby heating it to pyrolysis temperature.  The effluent synthesis gas is then used to generate electric power or other products typical of synthesis gas processes.<ref name=DOE/>

</ref> This technology like other reactive fluid technologies, is more appropriate for oil shales with low hydrogen content, such as the Eastern US Devonian shales, for which only a third of the organic carbon is typically converted to oil during conventional overground retorting. The hydrogen or [[hydrogen donor]] (a chemical that donates hydrogen to others during chemical reactions) react with coke [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] (a chemical structure in the oil shale that is prone to form coke during retorting but has not yet done so) and roughly double the yield of oil, depending on the characteristics of the shale and process.<ref name=hytort>

Chattanooga Corp. has developed an extraction process which uses a fluid bed reactor and an associated hydrogen fired heater. In this process, retorting occurs at relatively low temperatures ({{convert|1000|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|-1|disp=s}}) through thermal cracking and hydrogenation into hydrocarbon vapors and spent solids. The thermal cracking allows for hydrocarbon vapors to be extracted off the oil shale which is then extracted and scrubbed of solids. The vapor is then cooled, during which condensate drops out of the gas and the remaining hydrogen, light hydrocarbon and acid gases are passed through an amine scrubbing system to remove [[hydrogen sulfide]] which is converted to elemental sulfur. The cleaned hydrogen and light hydrocarbon gases are then fed back into the system for compression or into the hydrogen heater which provides the heat for the fluid bed reactor. This nearly-closed-loop allows for an efficient process where nearly all the energy needs are provided by the source material. The demonstration plant in [[Alberta]] was able to produce {{bbl to t|930|API=29}} of oil per kilotonne of oil shale at an [[API gravity]] ranging between 28 to 30. With hydrotreating (the reaction of oil with high pressure hydrogen), it would be possible to improve this to 38-40 <U+00B0>API.  Chattanooga Corp is currently looking at a design to produce a {{bbl to t|2500|API=39|per=h|adj=on}} facility.<ref name=DOE>

==''In situ'' technologies==
In ''in situ'' processing technologies, the oil shale is heated underground. Potentially these technologies are able to extract more oil from a given area of land than conventional ''ex situ'' processing technologies, as the wells can reach greater depths than surface strip-mines.<ref name=california>

</ref> Several companies have patented methods for ''in situ'' retorting. However, most of these methods are still in experimental stages.

The ''in situ'' technologies are usually classified as ''true in situ'' processes (TIS) and ''modified in situ'' processes (MIS). ''True in situ'' processes do not involve mining the oil shale. The ''modified in situ'' processes involve drilling and fracturing the target deposit above the mined area to create a void space of 20-25% which improves the flow of gases and liquid fluids through the rock formation, thereby increasing the volumes and quality of the oil produced.<ref name=fossilenergy/>

===Early ''in situ'' processes===
A variety of true ''in situ'' processes were tried prior to the oil shale crash in the 1980s. Most notable are the Equity Oil process, which injected superheated steam in the permeable leached zone of Colorado<U+2019>s Piceance Basin,<ref name=equityoilt>

Variations of the modified ''in situ'' (MIS) process have been investigated by the US Bureau of Mines, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, [[Occidental Petroleum]], Rio Blanco Corporation, and Multi-Mineral Corporation. An early concept in the 1960s was to create a rubble chimney using a nuclear explosive.<ref name=chimney>

===Modern ''in situ'' processes===
There has been a recent resurgence of interest in ''in situ'' recovery processes. In contrast to the 1980s emphasis on combustion retorting of subsurface rubble, current study focuses on true ''in situ'' processes, i.e. processes in which no shale removal or explosive uplift is used to create permeability. The processes can be separated by whether they inject hot fluids into the formation (Chevron CRUSH and Petro Probe) or use line or plane heating sources following by thermal conduction and convection to distribute heat through the formation (Shell ICP, EGL Resources, ExxonMobil Electrofrac). All but the Chevron CRUSH process are expected to produce a ~40 API gravity shale oil with fewer olefins and polar molecules due to ''in situ'' oil coking and cracking.

====Conduction through a wall technologies====
[[Image:Shell Freeze Wall Oil Shae.PNG|thumb|right|Shells Freeze Wall for ''in situ'' shale oil production]]
Conduction through a wall ''in situ'' technologies are the Shell's ''In situ'' Conversion Process (ICP), the EGL Resources Process and the IEP Geothermic Fuels Cells Process.  Since 2000, the [[Shell Oil Company]] has been developing its ''in situ'' method under the [[Mahogany Research Project]] in Colorado, {{convert|200|mi|km|-1}} west of [[Denver]], on Colorado's [[Western Slope]]. Though this method is energy intensive, it compares well to other heavy oil projects such as the [[tar sands]]. At full scale, it is estimated that for every unit of energy consumed, three to four units would be produced over the project life cycle.<ref name=shell/>  A freeze wall is first constructed to isolate the region to be retorted from surrounding groundwater. {{convert|2000|ft|m|0}} wells, eight feet apart, are drilled and circulated with a super-chilled liquid to cool the ground to {{convert|-60|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|-1}}. Water is then removed from the working zone. Heating and recovery wells are drilled on {{convert|40|ft|m|0}} spacing within the working zone. Electrical heating elements are lowered into the heating wells and used to heat the kerogen to {{convert|650|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|-1}} to {{convert|700|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|-1}} over a period of approximately four years, slowly converting it into oil and gases, which are then pumped to the surface. Shell believes that it will be possible to recover around 65-70% of the hydrocarbons by this technique. An operation producing 100,000&nbsp;barrels a day would require a dedicated power generating capacity of 1.2&nbsp;gigawatts. To maximize the functionality of the freeze walls, working zones will be developed, adjacent to each other in succession. This ''in situ'' method requires 100% surface disturbance, greatly increasing the footprint of extraction operations in comparison to conventional oil and gas drilling. The current test sites are expected to produce in the region of {{bbl to t|600|to|1500|API=29|per=d}}.<ref name=shell>

[[Image:EGL Process.jpg|thumb|right|EGL Oil Shale Process]]
The EGL Resources Process is a method which combines horizontal wells, through which steam is passed, and vertical wells, which provide both vertical heat transfer through refluxing of generated oil and a means to collect and produce the oil. In contrast to the Equity process, the steam circulates through a closed loop, and no fluids are injected into the formation. Horizontal heat transfer from the vertical wells is similar to that in the Shell ICP, and a similar quality of oil is expected. They are currently leasing a {{convert|160|acre|sqm|-4}} tract in the Piceance Basin from the US Bureau of Land Management for their tests.<ref name=EGLl>

In the Independent Energy Partners' Geothermic Fuels Cells Process (IEP GFC), a high-temperature fuel cell stack is placed in the formation to heat the ground. During an initial warm up period cells are fueled with an external source of natural gas), after which the process becomes self-fueling from gases liberated by its own waste heat. Raising the formation temperature increases fluid pressure in the heated zone to fracture oil shale. Alternatively, the formation can be pre-fractured to enhance the hydrocarbon flow between heating and producing wells. The IEP GFC is complained to have a net energy ratio of approximately 18&nbsp;units of energy produced per unit used, when primary recovery is combined with residual char gasification and resulting syntheses gas.<ref name=DOE/>

====Externally generated hot gas technologies====
[[Image:Chevron Oil Shale Project.PNG|thumb|right|Chevron CRUSH process]]
Externally generated hot gas ''in situ'' technologies are the Chevron CRUSH process, the Petro Probe process, and the MWE IGE technology. Chevron Corporation and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] formed a joint research project in 2006 to develop the Chevron CRUSH process. They are investigating whether carbon dioxide can be injected into the formation at a raised temperature which will decompose the kerogen into conventional hydrocarbons. The carbon dioxide would be injected via conventionally drilled wells and then exposed to the formation via a series of horizontal fractures where it would circulate around. The hydrocarbons would then be produced via conventional vertical oil wells. This method is based upon research and trials carried out in the 1950s by Sinclair Oil and Gas company which developed a method using natural and induced fractures between vertical wells to produce the ''in situ'' kerogen. Continental Oil (now [[ConocoPhillips]]) and the [[University of Akron]] also demonstrated and were issued patents which showed that carbon dioxide was a good carrier gas which helped recover the shale oil.<ref name=chevron>

Petro Probe, a subsidiary of Earth Science Search have listed a process which involves injecting super-heated air into wells drilled into the oil shale. The process involves injecting air which is super-heated at the surface, into wells drilled into the oil shale. The super-heated air then mixes and melts the ''in situ'' shale oil which is transported back to the surface in the form of gas which is then cooled and the condensate is collected. The remnant gas is then re-used to heat the air and is injected back with other waste products into the formation thereby minimizing the environmental impact.<ref name=DOE/> The Mountain West Energy's ''In Situ'' Gas Extraction (MWE IGE; also known as In Situ vapor Extraction) technology use same principles. High
temperature gas injected into the oil shale layer to heat the oil shale to the decomposition. The gas sweeps the oil vapors to the surface where the oil is condensed and separated. The gas is then recirculated.  This technology reduces the problems associated with the flow of liquid oil through the formation.<ref name=DOE/><ref name=MWE>

====ExxonMobil Electrofrac====
[[ExxonMobil]] has been involved in oil shale development since the 1960s and is currently focusing on ''in situ'' developments. They are concentrating on an ''in situ'' method which heats the oil shale via an electrically conductive heating fluid injected into the reservoir which heats the oil shale via a series of hydraulic fractures. The oil shale is produced by separate dedicated production wells. It is thought that the most likely method is to have horizontal wells which have been hydraulically fractured along the vertical axis. These wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. This will allow the two different charges to be applied at either end. ExxonMobil is pursuing this method as they believe it provides a better method, which is to surround the oil shale and heat it up. The Electrofrac method has been tested in laboratories and test sites are now currently being considered for a field trial.<ref name=DOE/>

====Volumetric heating by radiowave, microwave, and direct current technologies====
The concept of volumetric heating by radio waves (radio frequency processing) of oil shale was developed at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in the late 1970s. The concept was to heat modest volumes of shale, using vertical electrode arrays. Deeper large volumes could be processed at slower heating rates over a period of time. The technology was developed later by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and by several other inventors. The LLNL concept was based on the use of wells spaced at tens of meters to heat vast expanse of deep oil shale very slowly. The concept presumed a radio frequency at which the skin depth is many tens of meters, and thereby overcoming the thermal diffusion times needed for conductive heating.<ref name=AICHE/><ref name="Burnham">

According to a survey conducted by the [[RAND Corporation]], the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, [[retort|retorting plant]], [[upgrader|upgrading plant]], supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would be between [[US dollars|US$]]70<U+2013>95 ($440<U+2013>600/m<sup>3</sup>, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order for the operation to be profitable, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels. The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the complex was established. The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35<U+2013>70% after its first {{convert|500|Moilbbl}} were produced. Assuming an increase in output of {{convert|25|koilbbl/d}} during each year after the start of commercial production, the costs would then be expected to decline to $35<U+2013>48 per barrel ($220<U+2013>300/m<sup>3</sup>) within 12 years. After achieving the milestone of {{convert|1|Goilbbl}}, its costs would decline further to $30<U+2013>40 per barrel ($190<U+2013>250/m<sup>3</sup>).<ref name=rand>

A critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source is the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing, a ratio known as "Energy Returned on Energy Invested" ([[EROEI]]). A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil shale deposits as varying between 0.7<U+2013>13.3.<ref name=science2>

An additional economic consideration is the water needed in the oil shale retorting process, which may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity.

==Environmental impact==
{{main|Environmental impact of oil shale industry}}

Oil shale processing involves a number of environmental impacts. These impacts are more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent [[oxidation]] of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface water and groundwater, increased [[erosion]], sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the creation of [[particulates]] during processing, transport, and support activities.<ref name="Burnham" /><ref name="openpitimpacts">

In addition, combustion and thermal processing generate waste material, and the atmospheric emissions from its processing and combustion include carbon dioxide, a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.<ref name="nrdc">
