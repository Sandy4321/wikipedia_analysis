The '''Saint Croix Macaw''' (''Ara autocthones'')<ref name=wetmore1937/><ref name=wetmore1956/><ref name=forshaw/><!--name used by Wetmore 1937, 1956. Olson 2008 is lapsus, Olson pers. com. --> is an extinct species of [[Psittacidae|parrot]] originally described by [[Alexander Wetmore]] based on a sub-fossil bones unearthed by  L. J. Korn in 1934 from a [[midden|kitchen middens]] at an [[Amerindian]] [[archeology|archeological sites]] on the [[Caribbean island]]s of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]].  A second specimen was described by [[Storrs L. Olson]] and Edgar J. M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez based on a bones excavated from a similar site at [[Puerto Rico]], while a possible third specimen from [[Montserrat]] has been reported. The species is one of two medium-sized [[macaw]]s of the Caribbean, the other being the smaller [[Cuban Red Macaw]] (''Ara tricolor''). Its bones are distinct from [[amazon parrot]]s as well as from the other medium sized but geographically distant [[Lear's Macaw]] (''Anodorhynchus leari'') and [[Blue-throated Macaw]] (''Ara glaucogularis''). The natural range is unknown because parrots were regularly traded between islands by indigenous people.

==Name and etymology==

==Taxonomy==
The Saint Croix Macaw and the smaller [[Cuban Red Macaw]] (''Ara tricolor'') are the only two Caribbean macaw species that have been described with evidence that includes physical remains.<ref name="wetmore1937"/><ref name=forshaw/><ref name="Olson"/><ref name = Woods/><ref name="Olson1978"/> In addition, seven entirely [[hypothetical extinct species|hypothetical extinct macaw species]] from various Caribbean islands have been described based only on written accounts.<ref name="wetmore1937"/><ref name = Olson/><ref name = Woods/> Of the hypothetical species, the geographically nearest report is of the [[Lesser Antillean Macaw]] (''Ara guadeloupensis'') from [[Guadeloupe]].<ref name="wetmore1937"/><!--
The presence of a macaw on [[Hispaniola]] as claimed by Wetmore was later refuted by Olson, see Olson, S. L. (2005). "Refutation of the historical evidence for a Hispaniolan macaw (Aves: Psittacidae: Ara)". Caribbean journal of Science 49 (2): 319<U+2013>323.

--> According to Wetmore, taxonomic affinities with these hypothetical extinct species are unknown.<ref name="wetmore1937"/>

The [[tibiotarsus]] and [[carpometacarpus]] of the Santa Croix Macaw are of intermediate size.<ref name=wetmore1937/><ref name = Olson/> Olson and M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez determined that this species is only comparable to geographically distant macaws, namely [[Lear's Macaw]] (''Anodorhynchus leari'') from [[Brazil]] and the [[Blue-throated Macaw]] (''Ara glaucogularis'') from [[Bolivia]].<ref name = Olson/> Their detailed analysis of these and the other bones showed distinct differences from those species, particularly from the genus ''Anodorhynchus''.<ref name = Olson/> Based on this, authorities generally recognize this as a valid species.<ref name=wetmore1937/><ref name="forshaw"/><ref name = Olson/><ref name=Woods/><ref name="Olson1978"/>

==Description==
The [[subfossil]] left tibiotarsus ([[holotype]], [[National Museum of Natural History|USNM]] 483530) described by Wetmore was of an immature but full-grown bird.<ref name=wetmore1937/><ref name="Olson"/><ref name="Olson1978">{{cite journal |last1= Olson|first1= S. L.|last2= |first2= |year= 1978|title= A paleontological perspective of West Indian birds and mammals|journal= Zoogeography in the Caribbean|editor1-first= F.B.|editor1-last=Gill|volume= | location= The 1975 Leidy Medal Symposium.|issue= |pages= 99<U+2013>117|publisher= |doi= |url= http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/8455/1/VZ_85_Paleo_West_Indies.pdf|accessdate= }}</ref> Wetmore described the bone as similar to the tibiotarsus of ''Ara tricolor'', with a larger transverse width, but more slender compared with larger macaws.<ref name=wetmore1937/> The slender proportions of the bone, and more elongated ridges about the proximal end, distinguish the species from the [[amazon parrot]].<ref name=wetmore1937/>

[[File:Parrot Skeleton Lydekker with Saint Croix Macaw bones colored in.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Bird anatomy|Skeleton]] drawing of a unknown species of parrot by [[Richard Lydekker]] with in red the bones available for the Saint Croix Macaw.]] The bones found by M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez include the left [[coracoid]] (missing a portion of the head), the proximal and distal ends of the left [[humerus]], the proximal end of the right [[radius]], the left [[carpometacarpus]] (missing one [[metacarpal]]), the left [[femur]] (lacking the distal end), the right tibiotarsus (lacking part of the proximal articular surface), and the proximal fragment and worn distal portion of the left tibiotarsus (USNM 448344).<ref name = Olson>{{cite journal|last= Olson|first= Storrs L.|coauthors= Edgar J. M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez|year= 2008|title= New evidence of Ara autochthones from an archeological site in Puerto Rico: a valid species of West Indian macaw of unknown geographical origin (Aves: Psittacidae)|journal= Caribbean Journal of Science|volume= 44|issue= 2|pages= 215<U+2013>222|url= http://caribjsci.org/July08/44_215-222.pdf}}</ref>

Examination of the bones by Olson and M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez showed that he bones differ from amazon parrot bones not only in the tibiotarsus, which has a narrower internal [[condyle]] and a distinctive inner [[cnemial crest]] that is more pointed and extends further proximally. They furthermore observed the following differences: a proportionally much longer carpometacarpus with a process of alular metacarpal that is not curved proximally; a femur with a proportionally larger head; an elongated coracoid with a relative narrow shaft and a ventral lip of the [[glenoid facet]] that is more protruded; and a humerus with a more proximal placement of the [[ectepicondylar process]] and the attachment of [[pronator brevis]].<ref name = Olson/>

Olson and M<U+00E1>iz L<U+00F3>pez showed that the Saint Croix Macaw is within the same size range as the Blue-throated Macaw and the Lear's Macaw. The length of the tibiotarsus is shorter than in the Blue-throated Macaw but longer than in the Lear's Macaw, while the lengths of the coracoid, carpometacarpus, and femur are smaller. Besides the size, they observed that the pectoral attachment on the humerus is less excavated while the capital groove is wider; the head of the femur is more massive and when seen from the posterior side, more excavated under the head, neck, and [[trochanter]]. Furthermore, the more robust shaft of the femur sets it specifically apart from the Lear's Macaw while the tibiotarsus is more robust with a flared distal extremity.<ref name = Olson/>

==Distribution==
Bones of the species have been excavated at two islands in the Caribbean, Saint Croix and Puerto Rico. The location at Saint Croix is an pre-Columbian Amerindian village site near the current town of [[Concordia, Saint Croix, United States Virgin Islands|Concordia]], near the Southwest Cape.<ref name="wetmore1937"/><ref name=forshaw/> The bones from Puerto Rica were excavated from an inland village of the [[Saladoid]] [[pre-Columbian]] Indians that was located at the eastern bank of the [[R<U+00ED>o Bucan<U+00E1>]], North-East of the current city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]].<ref name = Olson/> A possible third location is Montserrat, where a nearly complete coracoid was excavated ([[Florida Museum of Natural History|UF]] 4416). The bone of this specimen is slightly smaller than the bone of the Puerto Rico specimen, and could therefore be within the range of the Cuban Red Macaw (''Ara tricolor''); it has not been assigned to either species.<ref name = Olson/>

Although the species had only been found in St. Croix and Puerto Rico, in both cases it was recovered from Amerindian village sites.  Williams and Steadman consider it possible that the species may have been native to St. Croix,<ref name = Woods>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Matthew I.|coauthors= David W.
