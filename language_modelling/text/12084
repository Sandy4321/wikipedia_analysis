A '''Media Access Unit''' ('''MAU''', also called '''Multistation Access Unit''', '''MSAU''') is a device to attach multiple network stations in a [[star topology]] in a [[Token ring]] network, internally wired to connect the stations into a logical ring. The MAU contains relays to short out nonoperating stations. Multiple MAUs can be connected into a larger ring through their Ring In/Ring Out connectors.

MAU's are also called the "Ring in a Box". The loop that used to make up the ring of the Token ring is now integrated into the chip. In Token ring, when a link is broken in the ring, the entire network goes down; however with an MAU, the broken circuit is immediately closed off (within 1ms) allowing stations on the ring to have their cords unplugged without crashing the entire network.
