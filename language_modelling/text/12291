==Special Education==
In December 2009, the district administration reported that 424 pupils or 19.5% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. <ref>[http://penndata.hbg.psu.edu/BSEReports/Public%20Reporting/2008_2009/PDF_Documents/Speced_Data_Report_SD010_008_Final.pdf Central Greene SD Special Education Data Report LEA Performance on State Performance Plan (SPP) Targets School Year 2008-2009]</ref> 

The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs.  At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress.  To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis.  These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.  Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. <ref>[http://www.cgsd.org/164910223191250300/site/default.asp Central Greene School District Annual Public Notice 2010]</ref>

====Act 1 Adjusted Index====
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.]</ref>
