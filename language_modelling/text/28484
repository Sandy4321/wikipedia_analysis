'''Calixtus III''' ([[December 31]], [[1378]] &ndash; [[August 6]], [[1458]]), n<U+00E9> '''''Alfons de Borja''''', was born near [[X<U+00E0>tiva]], [[Val<U+00E8>ncia]], today [[Spain]] but then  [[Kingdom of Valencia]] under the [[Crown of Aragon]], and was [[Pope]] from [[April 8]], [[1455]] to his death in 1458.  His early career was spent as a professor of [[law]] at [[University of Lleida]] and then as a [[diplomat]] in the service of the Kings of [[Aragon]], especially during the [[Council of Basel]] (1431&ndash;1439).  He became a [[Catholic Cardinal|cardinal]] after reconciling [[Pope Eugene IV]] (1431&ndash;1447) with King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (1416&ndash;1458).

He was raised to the papal chair in [[1455]] as Calixtus III at a very advanced age as a compromise candidate. He was viewed by historians as being feeble and incompetent. The great object of his policy was the urging of a [[crusade]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]], who had captured [[Constantinople]] in [[1453]], but he did not find the Christian princes responsive to his call despite his every effort.  

Pope Calixtus III made two of his nephews cardinals, one of whom, Roderic de Borgia, later became [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492&ndash;1503), who was reportedly infamous for corruption.

On [[June 29]], [[1456]], he ordered the bells to be rung at noon (see [[noon bell]]) in all the Church to call Christians for praying. As news spread with some delay, this order became connected with the [[Siege of Belgrade]] (which happened on [[July 22]]), a victory against the Turks. To commemorate this victory, Calixtus III ordered the [[Transfiguration]] to be held on [[August 6]].

He ordered a new trial for [[St. Joan of Arc]] (c. 1412&ndash;1431), at which she was posthumously vindicated after being controversially tried and executed.

Calixtus III's pre-papal [[coat of arms]] featured a grazing ox.
==The "bull against the comet."==
According to one story, first appearing in a posthumous biography in [[1475]] and later embellished and popularized by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], Calixtus III [[excommunication|excommunicated]] the 1456 apparition of [[Halley's Comet]], believing it to be an ill omen for the Christian defenders of [[Belgrade]], who were at that time being besieged by the armies of the [[Ottoman Empire]].  No known primary source supports the authenticity of this account.  Calixtus III's [[papal bull]] of [[June 29]], [[1456]], which called for public prayer for the success of the crusade, makes no mention of the comet, and by [[August 6]], when the Turkish siege was broken, the comet had not been visible from Europe or Turkey for several weeks.
