'''Colton James Brennan''' (born [[August 16]], [[1983]] in [[Laguna Beach, California]]) is an [[American football]] quarterback for the [[University of Hawaii]]. He holds the NCAA record for most touchdown passes in a single season.

==High school career==
Brennan attended [[Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)|Mater Dei High School]] in California, where he led his team to the league championship as a sophomore. He also helped Mater Dei to the league championship in basketball as a senior. While at Mater Dei, Brennan was the back-up quarterback to [[Matt Leinart]] until Leinart graduated. After graduating from Mater Dei, Brennan attended [[Worcester Academy]] in Massachusetts for a postgraduate year, where his primary targets were [[David Ball]], now an All-American receiver at the [[University of New Hampshire]], and [[Carl Elliott]], the starting point guard on [[George Washington University|George Washington]]'s basketball team.

==College career==
===Colorado===
Brennan originally joined the [[University of Colorado]] football team in 2003 as a walk on. He spent the year as a [[redshirt]].

On [[January 28]], [[2004]], Brennan was arrested by campus police for entering a co-ed's room uninvited where he allegedly "exposed himself and fondled her".[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=2705343] Brennan was intoxicated at the time of the incident and eventually pleaded guilty to charges of [[burglary]] and [[tresspassing]], but a guilty verdict for unlawful sexual contact was vacated by the court for lack of evidence. After the incident, which was caught up in the middle of the time when CU was flooded with other accusations of sex crimes and revelations of wild recruiting parties involving Colorado football players, Brennan was almost immediately kicked off the team.[http://starbulletin.com/2005/06/26/sports/story1.html]

===Saddleback Community College===
Brennan transferred to [[Saddleback Community College]] in California in 2004 and helped lead the school to a conference championship. He was named honorable mention All-America, state offensive player of the year, and first-team all-conference for his performance that season. Brennan repaired his image well enough for Hawaii head coach [[June Jones]] to offer him a walk-on opportunity at Hawaii. Brennan accepted the offer and turned down other offers from [[Syracuse University]] and [[San Jose State University]].

===University of Hawaii===
Brennan joined Hawaii in 2005 and quickly grabbed the starting spot at quarterback. He started 10 of 12 games, the only games he did not start being against [[University of Southern California Trojans football|USC]] and [[San Diego State]]. Brennan either tied or broke 11 UH offensive records in what was a wildly successful first season with the Warriors. Brennan led the country in total offense yards (4,455) and touchdowns thrown (35). His 4,301 yards passing is the eighth-most in [[Western Athletic Conference]] history. Against [[New Mexico State]] (Oct. 15), Brennan posted career-high numbers in passing yards (515), touchdowns (7), and pass completions (38). He also had nine 300+ yard performances on the season, including four 400+ yard games and a 515-yard performance. 

Brennan entered the [[2006 NCAA Division I-A football season]] as the undisputed starter at quarterback, was named to multiple award watch lists and was voted the WAC's preseason offensive player of the year. He led the nation in scoring and [[passing efficiency]], finishing the regular season with a 182.8 rating, and completed 72.15% of his passes, the best mark in Division I-A. 

During the regular season, Brennan passed for 53 touchdowns, one shy of the NCAA single-season touchdown record of 54 (set in 1990 by [[David Klingler]] of The [[University of Houston]]).  On December 24, 2006, at the Hawaii Bowl, Brennan threw for 5 touchdowns to break the record.  (Stats accumulated during the post season now count towards records)[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/cfootball/2060AP_FBC_Brennan_Record.html]. The Warriors finished the regular season with a 11-3 record, placing second in the WAC behind [[Boise State]].

Brennan finished sixth in the 2006 [[Heisman]] race, behind winner [[Troy Smith]], [[Darren McFadden]], [[Brady Quinn]], [[Steve Slaton]], and [[Mike Hart]]. Should Brennan return for his senior season, he is expected to be a top contendor for the 2007 Heisman[http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061224/SPORTS0201/612240361/1035/SPORTS]. 

On [[December 2]], 2006, his football career was featured on ESPN's [[College GameDay]]. It began, "In the last five years, over the thousands of miles he has traveled, the one constant in Colt Brennan's life has been change."
