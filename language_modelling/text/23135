'''''Mannaja''''' (also known under the English title '''''A Man Called Blade''''', USA) is an Italian [[Western (genre)|western]] film from 1977 directed by [[Sergio Martino]]. The main role, Blade, is played by [[Maurizio Merli]]. Other central roles are played by [[John Steiner]], [[Sonja Jeannine]], [[Donald O'Brien (actor)|Donald O'Brien]], [[Philippe Leroy (actor)|Philippe Leroy]] and [[Martine Brochard]].

==Plot==
Man hunter Blade (Maurizio Merli) arrives at the mining town of Suttonville with the lawless Burt Craven (Donald O'Brien) as his prisoner. He gets noticed when he uses a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] in their fight against an outlaw. After a short time, Blade's reputation becomes grater, and he comes to the attention of the city's wealthy and crippled mayor, McGowan (Philippe Leroy) and his corrupt lackey Voller (John Steiner), hired to find the mayor's daughter (Sonja Jeannine) who has disappeared. Blade is not aware that she has been kidnapped by Voller, who secretly works for a gang that regularly plunders coachloads of silver from the mayor's silver mine. After a while, Blade is imprisoned, beaten up, and left to die as part of a plan by Voller and his men. However, against all the odds, he survives. Blade prepares for the final battle, but not only against Voller and his gang. He also wants revenge against those who killed his father when he was small.

The film was released on DVD in 2002 (Region 2).

===About the film===
''Mannaja'' is an unusual [[spaghetti western]], in that it contains some symbolism and emotional scenes that give the viewer the feel of an adventure or horror film, particularly in the opening scene in the swamp, and the scene in the cave. ''Mannaja'' has been compared to a contemporaneous film called ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976). Like other spaghetti westerns it is sometimes rather brutal, and contains fairly graphic depictions of murder with an axe. It was banned in Sweden.
