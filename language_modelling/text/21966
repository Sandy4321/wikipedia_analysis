'''ARA ''Moreno'''''<ref group=N>"ARA" is an [[acronym]] for [[Argentine Navy|''Armada de la Rep<U+00FA>blica Argentina'']]</ref> was a [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] built for the [[Argentine Navy|''Armada de la Rep<U+00FA>blica Argentina'']] in the early 1910s. She was named after [[Mariano Moreno]], a key member of the ''[[Primera Junta]]'', and she was the second of two {{Sclass|Rivadavia|battleship|0}} [[battleship]]s; her [[sister ship|sister]] was [[ARA Rivadavia|''Rivadavia'']] ''Moreno'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 September 1911 and completed in March 1915. A multitude of rumors regarding whether Argentina was going to sell ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' to one of the belligerent countries then fighting in the [[World War I|First World War]] were spread, but both were delivered and kept. This followed a series of mishaps and ''Moreno'' underwent an extensive refit in the United States in 1924<U+0096>&ndash;25. The 1930s were occupied with diplomatic cruises to Brazil, Uruguay, and Europe. As Argentina was neutral in the [[World War II|Second World War]], ''Moreno'' was employed little in those years. [[Decommissioned]] in 1949, she was sold for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in February 1956. After a 96-day tow&mdash;which was then a world record&mdash;''Moreno'' was scrapped in Japan.

==Background==
In 1902, territorial disputes between Argentina and Chile over the boundary of [[Patagonia]] and control of the [[Beagle Channel]] were settled via British mediation. Provisions in the treaty which ended the dispute imposed restrictions on the navies of both countries. The British [[Royal Navy]] bought two [[pre-dreadnought]] battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold two of its cruisers, then under construction in Italy, to Japan.<ref name="Hore">Hore, ''Battleships of World War I, 91.</ref>

After the commissioning of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, Brazil decided in early 1907 to halt three now-outmoded pre-dreadnoughts which were then under construction in favor of two or three [[dreadnought]]s.<ref name=Whitley24>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 24.</ref><ref>Paulo de Oliveira Ribeiro, [http://www.naval.com.br/historia/dreadnought/dreadnought-port1.htm Os Dreadnoughts Da Marinha Do Brasil: Minas Geraes e S<U+00E3>o Paulo] {{pt icon}}, Poder Naval Online, accessed 16 April 2009.</ref> These ships, which were designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time,<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF Germany may buy English warships]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 August 1908, C8.</ref> and were described as "the last word in heavy battleship design" by ''[[Scientific American]]'',<ref>"The Brazilian Battleship "Minas Geraes"," ''[[Scientific American]]'' '''102''', (19 March 1910): 240&ndash;241. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}.</ref> came as an abrupt shock to the Argentine navy.<ref name=Whitley24/> Historian Robert Schenia commented that they "outclassed the entire [elderly] Argentinian fleet."<ref>Schenia, "Argentina," 400.</ref> Although debates raged over whether it would be prudent to acquire dreadnoughts, which would cost upwards of two million [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] (158 million sterling in 2008 terms), to counter Brazil's purchase, more border disputes with Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil decided the matter.<ref>Schenia, "Argentina," 401.</ref>

== Construction and trials ==
''Moreno''{{'}}s [[keel]] was [[keel laying|laid]] on 9 July 1910 by the [[New York Shipbuilding|New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] of [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[New Jersey]]. After the completion of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], she was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 September 1911. Isabel Betbeder, wife to the chief of the Argentine Naval Commission&mdash;which was overseeing the ''Rivadavia'' class' construction&mdash;[[ship sponsor|sponsored]] ''Moreno''. {{convert|13|ST|LT t}} of [[tallow]] were needed to grease the [[slipway]]s for the launch. The ship was then moored to a dock to commence [[fitting out]],<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9402E4DB163CE633A25757C2A96F9C946096D6CF Moreno Launched For Argentine Navy]," ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 September 1911, 12.</ref> which was finished on 15 February.<ref name=Whitley21>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 21.</ref>

Over the course of their construction, ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' were the subject of various rumors insinuating that Argentina would accept the ships and then sell them to one of the European governments or even Japan, a fast-growing rival to the United States.<ref>"Germany Will Buy Two Battleships," ''[[Toronto World]]'', 10 August 1914, 12.</ref> In fact, the rumors were partially true; Argentina was looking to get rid of the battleships and devote the money gained to opening more schools. This angered the American government, as the ships had been built with the latest advances in American warship technology&mdash;yet they did not want to exercise a contract-specified option that gave the United States first choice if the Argentinians decided to sell, as naval technology had already progressed past the ''Rivadavia''s, particularly in the adoption of the "[[All or nothing (armor)|all-or-nothing]]" armor scheme. Instead, the United States, backed in its efforts by the [[United States Department of State|State]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Departments]], put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45&ndash;46</ref>

The Argentine government, bolstered by [[socialist]] gains in the legislature, refused to back down. No less than three [[bills]] proposing the sale of the battleships were introduced in May 1914, but all were defeated by late June. The beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]] reopened these rumors. The German and British ambassadors both complained to the United States' [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the reached Argentina, and the latter charged the United States with ensuring that the ships did not fall into anyone else's possession but Argentina. International armament companies attempted to influence Argentina into selling them to one of the smaller [[Balkan]] countries, from which they would find their way into the war on someone's side.<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 46&ndash;47</ref>{{#tag:ref|The specific example given in Livermore, footnote 
106, is that a "group of French bankers, on behalf of the Russian government, were offering in gold twice the contract price of the ships, which were to be turned over to Greece."<ref>Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 47</ref> Turning over the ships was likely meant as a way around the United States' neutrality rules.|group=N}}
In October 1914, ''Moreno'' sailed to New York where she was painted in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard|New York Naval Shipyard]]. With this finished on the 24th, ''Moreno'' went out to conduct her [[sea trials]] starting on the 25th. Reporters for newspapers, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', and American naval officers were allowed on board during this time; the ''Times'' reporters gave a glowing account of the alcohol-serving [[caf<U+00E9>]] on the ship, calling it "the cutest little bar on any of the seven seas." For the United States, this was an unheard-of feature, as alcohol had been banned on US Navy ships.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E1D91430E733A25755C2A9669D946596D6CF Argentine Ship No Dry Territory]," ''The New York Times'', 26 October 1914, 11.</ref>

The trials were plagued with serious engine trouble, culminating with the failure of an entire turbine on 2 November. ''Moreno'' was forced to put in at [[Rockland, Maine|Rockland]], [[Maine]]&mdash;where many of the observers on board were left to be brought back by train to Camden&mdash;before proceeding to the [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Massachusetts]] for repairs. Fore River was utilized because that company built the engines that were installed in the ship.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E4DF1738E633A25750C0A9679D946596D6CF New Battleship Disabled]," ''The New York Times'', 3 November 1914, 18.</ref>

In early 1915, nearly five years after construction began, a major row erupted between the Argentine government and the shipbuilding contractors. The latter wanted to be paid for additional work they had done, but the Argentines did not believe this was warranted, as ''Moreno'' had been scheduled to be completed more than a year prior. With mediating assistance from [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] at the time, ''Moreno'' was given to waiting Argentine sailors, who had been staying in American battleships moored in the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]], on 20 February. The dispute was handled by [[arbitration]].<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F03E5DE1238E633A2575BC1A9649C946496D6CF Dispute over Warship]," ''The New York Times'', 18 February 1915, 9.</ref><ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9903E5DE123FE233A25752C2A9649C946496D6CF Dreadnought Row Ended]," ''The New York Times'', 21 February 1915, 1.</ref><ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A03E5DE123FE233A25752C2A9649C946496D6CF <nowiki>[No Title]</nowiki>]," ''The New York Times'', 21 February 1915, 1.</ref>

Even ''Moreno''{{'}}s departure was marked by mishaps. On the night of 26 March, ''Moreno'' accidentally rammed and sunk the barge ''Enterprise'' when she was on the [[Delaware River]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of Philadelphia near the city of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]]. No one was hurt, but the battleship was accidentally run aground immediately thereafter. Efforts to refloat her succeeded, and ''Moreno'' continued on her way at around 7:30 the next morning without damage.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0DE1DE153BE233A2575BC2A9659C946496D6CF Battleship Sinks Barge]," ''The New York Times'', 28 March 1915, 5.</ref>

On the 29th, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was hosted for lunch onboard the warship, accompanied by the Argentine ambassador to the United States, [[Romulo S. Naon]].<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E1DC123FE233A25753C3A9659C946496D6C President Predicts Union of Americas]," ''The New York Times'', 30 March 1915, 4.</ref> On 15 April, ''Moreno'' ran aground in the river again, this time near [[Reedy Island]]. Like the previous time, she was not damaged and tugs were able to refloat the ship the next day.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E07E4DF1338E633A25755C1A9629C946496D6CF The Moreno Again Ashore]," 16 April 1915, 8.</ref><ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E5D91E3EE033A25754C1A9629C946496D6CF Argentine Ship Afloat]," ''The New York Times'', 17 April 1915, 6.</ref>

== Service ==
''Moreno'' docked in Argentina for the first time on 26 May 1915.{{#tag:ref|Whitley explains the delay between completion and arrival dates by noting that ''Moreno'' was "diverted to attend the ceremonies marking the opening of the Panama Canal and an international [[naval review|<nowiki>[naval]</nowiki> review]] in [[Hampton Roads]], [Virginia],"<ref name=Whitley21/> but a related ''New York Times'' article reveals that ''Moreno'' was not a participant.<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C05E6DC1338E633A2575BC0A9639C946496D6CF City To Welcome Fleet Today]," ''The New York Times'', 8 May 1915, 13.</ref>|group=N}} She was immediately assigned to the Argentine Navy's First Division, based out the major naval base of [[Puerto Belgrano]], where she remained until 1923, when she was put into the reserve fleet. In 1924, ''Moreno'' was sent to the United States for a major modernization. The opportunity to show the flag was not missed, as ''Moreno'' made stops in [[Valparaiso]] and [[Callao]] before transiting the Panama Canal and sailing north. Most of the work was done in Philadelphia, though armament changes were made in Boston. When she returned to Argentina in August 1926, ''Moreno'' was assigned to the training division of the Navy. She was then reassigned to the 1st Division sometime after the training division was abolished in 1928, and in 1932 she was moved into the new Battleship Division with ''Rivadavia''.<ref name=Whitley22>Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II'', 22.</ref>

The remainder of the 1930s was filled with diplomatic cruises.<ref name="Whitley22"/> In 1933, ''Moreno''&mdash;escorted by the three {{Sclass|Mendoza|destroyer|1}}s&mdash;brought Argentine president [[Agust<U+00ED>n Pedro Justo]] to Brazil for a major diplomatic visit.<ref name="Whitley22"/><ref>"Justo Off to Brazil on Oct. 7," ''The New York Times'', 21 September 1933, 11.</ref> Departing in the afternoon of 2 October, he arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on the morning of 7 October to huge celebrations. Brazilian ships of the first and second squadrons along with three squadrons' worth of warplanes met ''Moreno'' at sea and escorted her to the harbor. When Justo landed and traveled by car to [[Guanabra Palace]], the road was flanked by a plethora of army and naval forces along with thousands of citizens. Rio was described as "ablaze with light," and a {{convert|95|ft|m}}-high imitation of France's [[Arc de Triomphe]] was erected, onto which various colors were projected.<ref name="Brazil Welcomes">"Brazil Welcomes Head of Argentina," ''The New York Times'', 8 October 1933, 18.</ref> Justo then took a [[Royal Train|royal train]], originally designed for [[Albert I of Belgium]]'s use during Brazil's 1922 centennial celebrations, to [[Sao Paulo]]. After three days, he traveled to [[Santos]], where he boarded ''Moreno'' to travel to first Uruguay, then back to Argentina; he arrived in the latter on 22 October.<ref name="Whitley22"/><ref>"Justo Off for Sao Paulo," ''The New York Times'', 12 October 1933, 9.</ref> 

In 1934, ''Moreno'' was sent as one of Argentina's representatives for the anniversary of Brazil's independence. In 1937, ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' were sent on a diplomatic cruise to Europe. Departing Argentina on 6 April, they split up when they reached the [[English Channel]].<ref name="Whitley21-22">Whitley, ''Battleships of World War II, 21&ndash;22.</ref> ''Moreno''  participated in the British [[Fleet Review|Spithead Naval Review]], where ''The New York Times'' described her as "a strange vestigial sea monster in this company of more modern fighting ships."<ref>[[Hanson W. Baldwin|Hanson Baldwin]], "158 Warships Boom Salute to George in Spithead Review," ''The New York Times'', 21 May 1937, 1 and 9.</ref> After, ''Moreno'' sailed to [[Brest, France|Brest]], France to meet up with ''Rivadavia'', from which they cruised to [[Wilhelmshaven]] before splitting paths again; ''Moreno'' went to [[Bremen]], while ''Rivadavia'' put in at [[Hamburg]]. They then sailed for home and arrived in Puerto Belgrano on 29 June.<ref name="Whitley21-22"/>

In November 1939, ''Moreno'' and ''Rivadavia'' traveled together to Brazil with naval cadets. However, before they could return, four {{Sclass|Buenos Aires|destroyer|1}}s had to be sent to escort the ships back, as the [[World War II|Second World War]] had erupted in Europe. As Argentina remained neutral in the war, ''Moreno'' was utilized little. By 1949, she had been [[decommissioned]] into reserve and was used as an [[barracks ship]]. In 1955, during the ''[[Revoluci<U+00F3>n Libertadora]]'', ''Moreno'' was used as a [[prison ship]]. Also during this time, ''Moreno''{{'}}s crew was reduced to the bare minimum. On 1 October 1956, the ship was [[wikt:stricken|stricken]] from the navy list; on 11 January 1957, Argentina sold the old warship to [[ship breaking|scrappers]] for $2,468,660. Five months later (12 May), the Argentine fleet assembled to salute ''Moreno'' one last time as she was towed out by the Dutch-owned [[ocean tug]]s ''Clyde'' and ''Ocean''. ''Moreno'' was taken through the Panama Canal to Japan's [[Yawata Iron and Steel Company]], where they arrived on 17 August; the tow lasted 96 days, which was a world record at the time.<ref name=Whitley22/><ref>"96 Day Tow," ''The New York Times'', 18 August 1957, 61.</ref>
