The '''Byzantine Empire''' (a [[historiography|historiographical]] term used since the [[19th century]]) and '''Eastern Roman Empire''' are expressions used to describe the [[Roman Empire]] of the Middle Ages, centered on its capital of [[Constantinople]], referred to by its inhabitants simply as the '''Roman Empire''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Polytonic|<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+1FEC><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}}) or '''Romania''' ({{Polytonic|<U+1FEC><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}), its [[Byzantine emperors|emperors]] continuing the unbroken succession of [[Roman emperors]], preserving [[Greco-Roman]] legal and cultural traditions; to the [[Islamic world]] it was known primarily as <U+0631><U+0648><U+0645><U+200E> ([[R<U+00FB>m]], "land of the Romans").

As an outgrowth of the eastern portion of Empire founded in [[Rome]], the Byzantine Empire's evolution into a separate culture from the West can be seen as a process beginning with Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]'s transferring the capital from [[Nicomedia]] in [[Anatolia]] to [[Byzantium]] on the [[Bosporus|Bosphorus]] (then renamed Nova Roma, and later Constantinople). By the 7th century under the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]], whose reforms changed the nature of the [[Byzantine army|Empire's military]] and recognized Greek as the official language, the Empire had taken on a distinct new character. 

During its existence the Empire suffered numerous setbacks and losses of territory yet it remained one of the most powerful economic, cultural and military  forces in Europe. The empire's influence also spread into North Africa and the near East for much of the Middle Ages. After a final [[Komnenian restoration|recovery under the Komnenian dynasty]] in the 12th century the Empire slipped into a long decline culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople|capture of Constantinople]] and the remaining Roman/Greek territories by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century. 

During her thousand-year reign, the Empire, a bastion of [[Christianity]] and one of the prime trade centers in the world, helped to shield Western Europe from [[Byzantine-Arab wars|early Muslim expansion]], provided a stable gold currency for the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]], influenced the laws, political systems, and customs of much of [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and preserved much of the literary works and scientific knowledge of [[ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and many other cultures.

==Etymology==
{{details|Names of the Greeks}}
{{Byzantine Empire timeline infobox}}

The term "Byzantine Empire" is an invention of historians and was never used during the Empire's lifetime. The Empire's name in Greek was ''Basileia Rh<U+014D>mai<U+014D>n'' ({{lang-el|<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+1FEC><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}}) &mdash; "The Empire of the Romans" &mdash; a translation of the Latin name of the Roman Empire ({{lang-la|Imperium Roman<U+014D>rum}});  or just ''Rh<U+014D>mania'' ({{lang-el|<U+1FEC><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}).

The term "Byzantine" itself comes from "[[Byzantium]]", the name that the city of [[Constantinople]] had before it became the capital of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. This older name of the city would rarely be used from this point onward except in historical or poetic contexts.

The designation of the Empire as "Byzantine" began in [[Western Europe]] in 1557, when [[Germans|German]] historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] published his work ''Corpus Histori<U+00E6> By<U+00AD>zantin<U+00E6>'', a collection of Byzantine sources. The publication in 1648 of the ''Byzantine du Louvre'' (''Corpus Scriptorum Histori<U+00E6> Byzantin<U+00E6>''), and in 1680 of [[Du Cange]]'s ''Historia Byzantina'' further popularized the use of ''Byzantine'' among French authors, such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].<ref>Fox, [http://www.romanity.org/htm/fox.01.en.what_if_anything_is_a_byzantine.01.htm What, If Anything, Is a Byzantine?]</ref> It was not until the 19th century, however, with the birth of modern Greece, that the term "Byzantine" came into general use in the [[Western world]].

Before this, the Empire was described by Western Europeans as ''Imperium Graecorum'' (Empire of the Greeks)&mdash;Byzantine claims to Roman inheritance had been actively contested from at least the time of the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|''Imperator Augustus'']] by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800. Whenever the [[Pope]]s or the rulers of the West wanted to make use of the name ''Roman'' to refer to the Byzantine emperors, they preferred the term ''Imperator Romani<U+00E6>'' instead of ''Imperator Romanorum'', a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.<ref name="Helios">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hellas, Byzantium|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios}}</ref>

{{Seealso|Late Antiquity}}

===The Tetrarchy===
{{main|Tetrarchy|Diocletian}}

[[Image:Roman Empire about 395.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Roman Empire ca. 395, showing the dioceses and praetorian prefectures of [[Gaul]], [[Italy]], [[Illyricum]] and Oriens (east), roughly analogous to the four Tetrarchs' zones of influence after Diocletian's reforms.]] 
During the 3rd century, three crises threatened the Roman Empire: external invasions, internal civil wars and an economy riddled with weaknesses and problems.<ref name="BF">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/1*.html#1 1]<br />* Fenner, [http://www.roman-empire.net/articles/article-018.html Economic Factors]</ref> The city of Rome gradually became less important as an administrative centre. The [[Crisis of the Third Century|crisis of the 3rd century]] displayed the defects of the heterogeneous system of government that [[Augustus]] had established to administer his immense dominion. His successors had introduced some modifications, but events made it clearer that a new, more centralised and more uniform system was required.<ref name="B1">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/1*.html#1 1]</ref>

[[Diocletian]] was responsible for creating a new administrative system (the [[tetrarchy]]).<ref name="B1" /> He associated himself with a co-emperor, or ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''. Each Augustus was then to adopt a young colleague, or ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', to share in the rule and eventually to succeed the senior partner. After the abdication of Diocletian and [[Maximian]], however, the tetrachy collapsed, and [[Constantine I]] replaced it with the dynastic principle of hereditary succession.<ref name="BG">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}<br />* Gibbon (1906), II, {{PDFlink|[http://olldownload.libertyfund.org/Texts/Gibbon0105/DeclineAndFall/Vol02/PDFs/0214-02_Pt06_Chap14.pdf 200]|2.61&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 2739487 bytes -->}}</ref>

===Constantine I and his successors=== 
{{main|Constantine I}}

[[Image:Constantine's baptism.jpg|left|thumb|''The Baptism of Constantine'' painted by [[Raphael]]'s pupils (1520<U+2013>1524, [[fresco]], [[Vatican City]], [[Apostolic Palace]]). [[Eusebius of Caesaria]] records that, as was customary among Christian converts at the time, Constantine delayed receiving [[baptism]] until shortly before his death.<ref>Eusebius, IV, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iv.lxii.html lxii]</ref>]]
Constantine moved the seat of the Empire, and introduced important changes into its civil and religious constitution.<ref name="G168">Gibbon (1906), III, {{PDFlink|[http://olldownload.libertyfund.org/Texts/Gibbon0105/DeclineAndFall/Vol03/PDFs/0214-03_Pt04_Chap18.pdf   168]|2.35&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 2466746 bytes -->}}</ref> In 330, he founded Constantinople as a second Rome on the site of Byzantium, which was well-positioned astride the trade routes between East and West; it was a superb base from which to guard the [[Danube]] river, and was reasonably close to the Eastern frontiers. Constantine also began the building of the [[Walls of Constantinople|great fortified walls]], which were expanded and rebuilt in subsequent ages. [[J. B. Bury]] asserts that "the foundation of Constantinople [...] inaugurated a permanent division between the Eastern and Western, the Greek and the Latin, halves of the Empire<U+2014>a division to which events had already pointed<U+2014>and affected decisively the whole subsequent [[history of Europe]]."<ref name="B1" />

Constantine built upon the administrative reforms introduced by Diocletian.<ref name="BE">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/1*.html#1 1]<br />* Esler (2000), 1081</ref> He stabilized the coinage (the gold [[solidus]] that he introduced became a highly prized and stable currency<ref name="E1081">Esler (2000), 1081</ref>), and made changes to the structure of the army. To divide administrative responsibilities, Constantine replaced the single [[praetorian prefect]], who had traditionally exercised both military and civil functions, with regional prefects enjoying civil authority alone. In the course of the 4th century, four great sections emerged from these Constantinian beginnings, and the practice of separating civil from military authority persisted until the 7th century.<ref name="B25-26">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/2*.html#1 25<U+2013>26]</ref> 

Under Constantine, [[Christianity]] did not become the exclusive religion of the state, but enjoyed imperial preference, since [[Constantine I and Christianity|the Emperor supported it with generous privileges]]: clerics were exempted from personal services and taxation, Christians were preferred for administrative posts, and bishops were entrusted with judicial responsibilities.<ref name="EM">Esler (2000), 1081<br />* Mousourakis (2003), 327<U+2013>328</ref> Constantine established the principle that emperors should not settle questions of doctrine, but should summon [[Ecumenical council|general ecclesiastical councils]] for that purpose. The [[Synod of Arles]] was convened by Constantine, and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] showcased his claim to be head of the Church.<ref name="B163">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/2*.html#5 163]</ref>

The state of the Empire in 395 may be described in terms of the outcome of Constantine's work. The dynastic principle was established so firmly that the emperor who died in that year, [[Theodosius I]], could bequeath the imperial office jointly to his sons: [[Arcadius]] in the East and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] in the West. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over the full extent of the empire in both its halves.<ref name="Br">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>

==Early history==
[[Image:Leo I Louvre Ma1012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] of the Byzantine Empire (401<U+2013>474, reigned 457<U+2013>474).]]
The Eastern Empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West in the third and fourth centuries, due in part to a more firmly established urban culture and greater financial resources, which allowed it to placate invaders with [[tribute]] and pay barbarian [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Throughout the fifth century, various invading armies overran the Western Empire but spared the east. [[Theodosius II]] further fortified [[Walls of Constantinople|the walls of Constantinople]], leaving the city impenetrable to attacks; they were not breached until 1204. To fend off the [[Huns]] of [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], Theodosius gave them subsidies (purportedly 300&nbsp;kg (700&nbsp;lb) of gold).<ref name=Nathan>Nathan, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/theo2.htm Theodosius II (408-450 A.D.)]</ref> Moreover, he favored merchants living in Constantinople who traded with the barbarians. 

His successor, [[Marcian]], refused to continue to pay this exorbitant sum. However, Attila had already diverted his attention to the Western Roman Empire.<ref>Treadgold (1995), 193</ref> After he died in 453, his empire collapsed and Constantinople initiated a profitable relationship with the remaining Huns, who would eventually fight as mercenaries in Byzantine armies.<ref>Alemany (2000), 207<br>* Treadgold (1997), 184</ref>

After the fall of Attila, the true chief in Constantinople was the [[Alans|Alan]] general [[Aspar]]. [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]] managed to free himself from the influence of the barbarian chief by supporting the rise of the [[Isauri]]ans, a semi-[[barbarian]] tribe living in southern [[Anatolia]]. Aspar and his son Ardabur were murdered in a riot in 471, and henceforth, Constantinople was freed from the influence of barbarian leaders for centuries.<ref>Treadgold (1997), 152-155</ref> 

Leo was also the first emperor to receive the crown not from a military leader, as was the Roman tradition, but from the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], representing the ecclesiastical hierarchy. This change became permanent, and in the Middle Ages the religious characteristic of the coronation completely supplanted the old military form. In 468, Leo unsuccessfully attempted to reconquer North Africa from the Vandals.<ref name="C553">Cameron (2000), 553</ref> By that time, the Western Roman Empire was restricted to Italy and the lands south of the Danube as far as the Balkans (the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]] had invaded [[Roman Britain|Britain]] as early as 410; the [[Visigoths]] and [[Suebi]] had possessed portions of [[Spania]] since 417, and the Vandals had entered Africa in 429; [[Gaul]] was contested by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], [[Burgundians]], [[Bretons]], Visigoths and some Roman remnants; and [[Theodoric]] was destined to rule in Italy until 526<ref name="Br" />).

In 466, as a condition of his Isaurian alliance, Leo married his daughter [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]] to the Isaurian Tarasicodissa, who took the name [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. When Leo died in 474, Zeno and Ariadne's younger son succeeded to the throne as [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo II]], with Zeno as regent. When Leo II died later that year, Zeno became emperor. The end of the Western Empire is sometimes dated to 476, early in Zeno's reign, when the barbarian general [[Odoacer]] deposed the titular Western Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]], but declined to replace him with another puppet. 
[[Image:3Byzantium476lightblue.PNG|thumb|left|310px|Eastern Roman Empire, c. AD 480 .]]
To recover Italy, Zeno could only negotiate with the [[Ostrogoths]] of Theodoric, who had settled in [[Moesia]]. He sent the barbarian king to Italy as ''magister militum per Italiam'' ("commander in chief for Italy"). After the fall of Odoacer in 493, Theodoric, who had lived in Constantinople during his youth, ruled Italy on his own. Thus, by suggesting that Theodoric conquer Italy as his Ostrogothic kingdom, Zeno maintained at least a nominal supremacy in that western land while ridding the Eastern Empire of an unruly subordinate.<ref name="Br" /> 

In 475, Zeno was deposed by [[Basiliscus]], the general who led Leo I's 468 invasion of North Africa, but he recovered the throne twenty months later. However, he faced a new threat from another Isaurian, [[Leontius]], who was also elected rival emperor. In 491  [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], an aged civil officer of Roman origin, became emperor , but it was not until 498 that the forces of the new emperor effectively took the measure of Isaurian resistance.<ref name="Br" /> Anastasius revealed himself to be an energetic reformer and an able administrator. He perfected Constantine I's coinage system by definitively setting the weight of the copper ''follis'', the coin used in most everyday transactions.<ref>Grierson (1999), 17</ref> He also reformed the tax system, and permanently abolished the hated [[chrysargyron]] tax. The State Treasury contained the enormous sum of 320,000 pounds of gold when he died.

==Justinian I and his successors==
{{seealso|Justinian I}}
[[Image:Justinian.jpg|thumb|Justinian depicted on one of the famous mosaics of the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]].]]
Justinian I, who assumed the throne in 527, oversaw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories. Justinian, the son of an [[Illyricum|Illyrian]] peasant, may already have exerted effective control during the reign of his uncle, [[Justin I]] (518<U+2013>527).<ref name="BEv">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}<br />* Evans, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/justinia.htm Justinian (AD 527<U+2013>565)]</ref> In 532, attempting to secure his eastern frontier, Justinian signed a peace treaty with [[Khosrau I of Persia]] agreeing to pay a large annual tribute to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassinids]]. In the same year, Justinian survived a revolt in Constantinople (the [[Nika riots]]) which ended with the death of (allegedly) thirty thousand rioters. This victory solidified Justinian's power.<ref name="Ev">Evans, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/justinia.htm Justinian (AD 527<U+2013>565)]</ref> [[Pope Agapetus I]] was sent to Constantinople by the [[Ostrogothic|Ostrogoths]] king [[Theodahad]], but failed in his mission to sign a peace with Justinian. However, he succeeded in having the [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople]] denounced, despite [[Empress Theodora]]'s support.
The western conquests began in 533, as Justinian sent his general [[Belisarius]] to reclaim the former province of [[Roman province of Africa|North Africa]] from the [[Vandal]]s with a small army of about 15,000 men. Success came with surprising ease, but it was not until 548 that the major local independent tribes were subdued.<ref name="Ev" /> In [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] Italy, the deaths of [[Theodoric the Great]], his nephew and heir [[Athalaric]], and his daughter [[Amalasuntha]] had left her murderer [[Theodahad]] on the throne despite his weakened authority. In 535, a small Byzantine expedition sent to [[Sicily]] met with easy success, but the Goths soon stiffened their resistance, and victory did not come until 540, when Belisarius captured [[Ravenna]], after successful sieges of [[Naples]] and Rome.<ref name="B180-216">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/18C*.html 180<U+2013>216]</ref> 

Nevertheless, the Ostrogoths were soon reunited under the command of [[Totila]] and captured Rome on [[December 17]], [[546]]; Belisarius was eventually recalled by Justinian in early 549.<ref name="B236-258">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/19B*.html 236<U+2013>258]</ref> The arrival of the Armenian [[eunuch]] [[Narses]] in Italy (late 551) with an army of some 35,000 men marked another shift in Gothic fortunes. Totila was defeated and died at the [[Battle of Busta Gallorum]]. His successor, [[Teias]], was likewise defeated at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] (October 552). Despite continuing resistance from a few Goth garrisons and two subsequent invasions by the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]], the war for the Italian peninsula was at an end.<ref name="B259-281">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/19C*.html 259<U+2013>281]</ref> In 551, a noble of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]], [[Athanagild]], sought Justinian's help in a rebellion against the king, and the emperor dispatched a force under Liberius, who, although elderly, proved himself a successful military commander. The Byzantine empire held on to a small slice of the [[Spania]] coast until the reign of [[Heraclius]].<ref name="B86-288">Bury (1923), [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/19D*.html 286<U+2013>288]</ref>
{{History of Greece}}

In the east, [[Roman-Persian Wars]] continued until 561 when Justinian's and Khusro's envoys agreed on a 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the [[Balkans]], which were subjected to repeated incursions from the [[Slavs]]. In 559, the Empire faced a great invasion of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Sclaveni]]. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement, but once the immediate danger was over, the emperor took charge himself. The news that Justinian was reinforcing his Danube fleet made the Kutrigurs anxious, and they agreed to a treaty which gave them a subsidy and safe passage back across the river.<ref name="Ev" />
[[Image:Theodora mosaik ravenna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]] (here with her retinue, mosaic from [[Basilica of San Vitale]], Ravenna), Justinian's influential wife, was a former [[Mime artist|mime actress]], whose earlier life is vividly described by [[Procopius]] in ''Secret History''.<ref>Procopius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/9*.html IX]</ref>]]
Justinian became universally famous because of his legislative work, remarkable for its sweeping character.<ref name="VJ">Vasiliev, [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_PC.HTM The Legislative Work of Justinian and Tribonian]</ref> In 529 a ten-man commission chaired by [[John the Cappadocian]] revised the ancient [[Roman law|Roman legal code]], creating the new ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', a collection of laws that came to be referred to as "Justinian's Code". In the ''[[Pandects]]'', completed under [[Tribonian]]'s direction in 533, order and system were found in the contradictory rulings of the great Roman jurists, and a textbook, the ''[[Institutiones]]'', was issued to facilitate instruction in the law schools. The fourth book, the ''Novellae'', consisted of collections of imperial edicts promulgated between 534 and 565. Because of his ecclesiastical policies, Justinian came into collision with the [[Jew]]s, the pagans, and various Christian sects. The latter included the [[Manichaeans]], the [[Nestorians]], the [[Monophysites]], and the [[Arians]]. In order to completely eradicate [[paganism]], Justinian closed the famous philosophic school in [[Athens]] in 529.<ref name="VE">Vasiliev, [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_PD.HTM The Ecclesiastical Policy of Justinian]</ref>

During the 6th century, the traditional [[Greco-Roman culture]] was still influential in the Eastern empire with prominent representatives such as the natural philosopher [[John Philoponus]]. Nevertheless, the Christian philosophy and culture were in the ascendant and began to dominate the older culture. Hymns written by [[Romanos]] the Melode marked the development of the [[Divine Liturgy]], while architects and builders worked to complete the new Church of the [[Holy Wisdom]], [[Hagia Sophia]], designed to replace an older church destroyed in the course of the Nika revolt. Hagia Sophia stands today as one of the major monuments of architectural history.<ref name="Br" /> During the 6th and 7th centuries the Empire was struck by a [[Plague of Justinian|series of epidemics]], which would greatly devastate the population, contributing to a significant economic decline and weakening of the Empire.<ref>Bray (2004), 19-47<br>* Haldon (1997), 110-111<br>* Treadgold (1997), 196-197</ref>
 
Justinian's successor, [[Justin II]], refused to pay the large tribute to the Persians. Meanwhile, the Germanic [[Lombards]] invaded Italy; by the end of the century only a third of Italy was in Byzantine hands. Justin's successor, [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius II]], choosing between his enemies, awarded subsidies to the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] while taking military action against the Persians. Although Tiberius' general, [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], led an effective campaign on the eastern frontier, subsidies failed to restrain the Avars. They captured the Balkan fortress of [[Sirmium]] in 582, while the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] began to make inroads across the Danube. Maurice, who in the meantime had become emperor, made peace with the Sassanian Emperor [[Khosrau II]], achieving access to Armenia, and [[Maurice<U+2019>s Balkan campaigns|forced the Avars and Slavs back across the Danube by 602]].<ref name="Br" />

Heraclius was the first emperor to replace the traditional Latin title for his office (''Augustus'') with the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'' ({{polytonic|<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2>}}).<ref>Shahid (1972), 295-96, 305.</ref> This shift from Latin to Greek finds a parallel in the contemporary abandonment of Latin in official documents.<ref>Haldon (1997), 404</ref> In an attempt to heal the doctrinal divide between [[Chalcedonian]] and [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] Christians, Heraclius proposed [[monotheletism]] as a compromise. In 638 the new doctrine was posted in the narthex of Hagia Sophia as part of a text called the ''Ekthesis'', which also forbade further discussion of the issue. By this time, however, [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]], both hotbeds of monophysite belief, had fallen to the Arabs, and another monophysite center, Egypt, fell by 642. Ambivalence toward Byzantine rule on the part of monophysites may have lessened local resistance to the Arab expansion.<ref>Haldon (1997), 49-50</ref>

Heraclius did succeed in establishing a dynasty, and his descendants held onto the throne, with some interruption, until 711. Their reigns were marked both by major external threats, from the west and the east, which reduced the territory of the empire to a fraction of its 6th-century extent, and by significant internal turmoil and cultural transformation.

This system may have had its roots in certain ''ad hoc'' measures taken by Heraclius, but over the course of the seventh century it developed into an entirely new system of imperial governance.<ref>Haldon (1997), 208-15<br>* Kaegi (2003), 236, 283.</ref>

[[Image:Greekfire-madridskylitzes1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Greek fire]], first used by the [[Byzantine Navy]] during the Byzantine-Arab Wars (from the [[Madrid Skylitzes]], [[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa<U+00F1>a]], [[Madrid]]).]]

The withdrawal of massive amounts of troops from the Balkans to combat the Persians and then the Arabs in the east opened the door for the gradual southward expansion of [[Slavic peoples]] into the peninsula, and, as in Anatolia, many cities shrank to small fortified settlements.<ref>Haldon (1997), 43-45, 66, 114-15.</ref> In the 670s the [[Bulgars]] were pushed south of the Danube by the arrival of the [[Khazars]], and in 680 Byzantine forces which had been sent to disperse these new settlements were defeated. In the next year [[Constantine IV]] signed a treaty with the Bulgar khan [[Asparukh of Bulgaria|Asparukh]], and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|new Bulgarian state]] assumed sovereignty over a number of Slavic tribes which had previously, at least in name, recognized Byzantine rule.<ref>Haldon (1997), 66-67.</ref> In 687/8, emperor [[Justinian II]] led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgars which made significant gains, although the fact that he had to fight his way from [[Thrace]] to [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.<ref>Haldon (1997), 71.</ref>

The one Byzantine city that remained relatively unaffected, despite a significant drop in population and at least two outbreaks of the plague, was Constantinople.<ref>Haldon (1997), 115-16.</ref> However, the imperial capital was marked by its own variety of conflict, both political and religious. [[Constans II]] continued the monothelete policy of his grandfather, Heraclius, meeting with significant opposition from laity and clergy alike. The most vocal opponents, [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[Pope Martin I]] were arrested, brought to Constantinople, tried, tortured, and exiled.<ref>Haldon (1997), 56-59.</ref>  Constans seems to have become immensely unpopular in the capital, and moved his residence to [[Syracuse, Sicily]], where he was ultimately murdered by a member of his court.<ref>Haldon (1997), 59-61.</ref> The [[Byzantine Senate|Senate]] experienced a revival in importance in the seventh century and clashed with the emperors on numerous occasions.<ref>Haldon (1997), 53, 61, 68-69, 74.</ref> The final Heraclian emperor, [[Justinian II]], attempted to break the power of the urban aristocracy through severe taxation and the appointment of "outsiders" to administrative posts. He was driven from power in 695, and took shelter first with the Khazars and then with the Bulgars. In 705 he returned to Constantinople with the armies of the Bulgar khan [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]], retook the throne, and instituted a reign of terror against his enemies. With his final overthrow in 711, supported once more by the urban aristocracy, the Heraclian dynasty came to an end.<ref>Haldon (1997), 70-78, 169-71<br>* Haldon (2004), 216-217<br>* Kountoura-Galake (1996), 62-75</ref> 

The 7th century was a period of radical transformation. The empire which had once stretched from Spain to Jerusalem was now reduced to Anatolia, [[Chersonesos]], and some fragments of Italy and the Balkans. The territorial losses were accompanied by a cultural shift; urban civilization was massively disrupted, classical literary genres were abandoned in favor of theological treatises,<ref>Cameron (1992)</ref> and a new "radically abstract" style emerged in the visual arts.<ref>Kitzinger (1976), 195</ref> That the empire survived this period at all is somewhat surprising, especially given the total collapse of the [[Sassanid Empire]] in the face of the Arab expansion, but a remarkably coherent military reorganization helped to withstand the exterior pressures and laid the groundwork for the gains of the following dynasty.<ref>Haldon (1997), 251.</ref>

==Isaurian dynasty and Iconoclasm==
[[Image:ByzantineEmpire717+extrainfo+themes.PNG|thumb|310px|The Byzantine Empire at the accession of Leo III, ''c.'' 717. Striped land shows land raided by the Arabs. Click on the image for names of provinces]] 
{{seealso|Iconoclasm (Byzantine)}}
[[Leo III the Isaurian]] turned back the Muslim assault in 718, and achieved a major victory at the expense of the Arabs in 740. He also addressed himself to the task of reorganizing and consolidating the themes in Asia Minor. His successor, [[Constantine V]], won noteworthy victories in northern Syria, and thoroughly undermined Bulgar strength. In the beginning of the 9th century the Arabs captured Crete, and successfully attacked Sicily, but on  [[September 3]], [[863]], general [[Petronas (The Patrician)|Petronas]] attained a huge victory against the [[emir]] of [[Melitene]]. Under the leadership of [[Krum]] the Bulgar threat also reemerged, but in 814 Krum's son, [[Omortag]], arranged a peace with the Byzantine Empire.<ref name="BH">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}<br />* {{cite encyclopedia|title=Hellas, Byzantium|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios}}</ref>

The 8th and 9th centuries were also dominated by controversy and religious division over [[iconoclasm (Byzantine)|Iconoclasm]]. [[Icon]]s were banned by Leo and Constantine, leading to revolts by [[iconodule]]s (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of [[Byzantine Empress Irene|Empress Irene]], the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] met in 787, and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshipped. Irene is said to have endeavored to negotiate a marriage between herself and [[Charlemagne]], but, according to [[Theophanes the Confessor]], the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favourites.<ref name="G89">Garland (1996), 89</ref> In 813 [[Leo V the Armenian]] restored the policy of iconoclasm, but in 843 [[Theodora (9th century)|Empress Theodora]] restored the veneration of the icons with the help of  [[Ecumenical Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Methodios]].<ref name="P11">Parry (1996), 11<U+2013>15</ref> Iconoclasm played its part in the further alienation of East from West, which worsened during the so-called [[Photian Schism]], when [[Pope Nicholas I]] challenged [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]]' elevation to the patriarchate.

==Macedonian dynasty and resurgence==
The Byzantine Empire reached its height under the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] emperors (of Armenian and Greek descent) of the late 9th, 10th, and early 11th centuries, when it gained control over the [[Adriatic Sea]], southern Italy, and all of the territory of [[tsar]] [[Samuil of Bulgaria]]. The cities of the empire expanded, and affluence spread across the provinces because of the new-found security. The population rose, and production increased, stimulating new demand while also helping to encourage [[trade]]. Culturally, there was considerable growth in education and learning. Ancient texts were preserved and patiently re-copied. [[Byzantine art]] flourished, and brilliant [[mosaic]]s graced the interiors of the many new churches.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich (1998)</ref> Though the empire was significantly smaller than during the reign of Justinian, it was also stronger, as the remaining territories were less geographically dispersed and more politically and culturally integrated.

===Internal developments===
Although traditionally attributed to [[Basil I]] (867<U+2013>886), initiator of the Macedonian dynasty, the "[[Byzantine renaissance]]" has been more recently ascribed to the reforms of his predecessor, [[Michael III]] (842<U+2013>867) and his wife's counsellor, the erudite [[Theoktistos]]. The latter in particular favoured culture at the court, and, with a careful financial policy, steadily increased the gold reserves of the Empire. The rise of the Macedonian dynasty coincided with internal developments which strengthened the religious unity of the empire.<ref>Treadgold (1991)</ref> The [[iconoclast]] movement was experiencing a steep decline: this favoured its soft suppression by the emperors and the reconciliation of the religious strife that had drained the imperial resources in the previous centuries. Despite occasional tactical defeats, the administrative, legislative, cultural and economic situation continued to improve under Basil's successors, especially with [[Romanos I|Romanos I Lekapenos]] (920<U+2013>944). The [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] system reached its definitive form in this period. The church establishment began to loyally support the imperial cause, and the power of the landowning class was limited in favour of agricultural small holders, who made up an important part of the military force of the Empire. These favourable conditions contributed to the increasing ability of the emperors to wage war against the Arabs.

===Wars against the Muslims===
{{mainarticle|Byzantine-Arab Wars (780 - 1180)}}
{{seealso|Muslim conquests}}
By 867, the empire had stabilised its position in both the east and the west, while the success of its defensive military structure had enabled the emperors to begin planning wars of reconquest in the east. 
[[Image:ByzantineEmpire867AD4lightpurple.PNG|thumb|350px|Byzantine Empire, c. 867 AD]]
The process of reconquest began with variable fortunes. The temporary reconquest of [[Crete]] (843) was followed by a crushing Byzantine defeat on the [[Bosporus]], while the emperors were unable to prevent the ongoing Muslim conquest of [[Sicily]] (827<U+2013>902). Using present day [[Tunisia]] as their launching pad, the Muslims conquered [[Palermo]] in 831, [[Messina]] in 842, [[Enna]] in 859, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in 878, [[Catania]] in 900 and the final Greek stronghold, the fortress of [[Taormina]], in 902.

These drawbacks were later counterbalanced by a victorious expedition against [[Damietta]] in Egypt (856), the defeat of the Emir of [[Melitene]] (863), the confirmation of the imperial authority over [[Dalmatia]] (867) and Basil I's offensives towards the [[Euphrates]] (870s).

The threat from the Muslims was meanwhile reduced by inner struggles and by the rise of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in the east. Muslims received assistance however from the [[Paulician]] sect, which had found a large following in the eastern provinces of the Empire and, facing persecution under the Byzantines, often fought under the Arab flag. It took several campaigns to subdue the Paulicians, who were eventually defeated by Basil I.<ref name=Norwich />

In 904, disaster struck the empire when its second city, [[Thessaloniki]], was sacked by an Arab fleet led by a Byzantine renegade. The Byzantines responded by destroying an Arab fleet in 908, and sacking the city of [[Laodicea]] in Syria two years later. Despite this revenge, the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911. 

The situation on the border with the Arab territories remained fluid, with the Byzantines alternatively on the offensive or defensive. The [[Varangians]], who attacked Constantinople [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|for the first time in 860]], constituted another new challenge. In 941 [[Rus'-Byzantine War (941)|they appeared on the Asian shore]] of the Bosporus, but this time they were crushed, showing the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when [[Rus'-Byzantine Treaty (907)|only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders]]. The vanquisher of the Varangians was the famous general [[John Kourkouas]], who continued the offensive with other noteworthy victories in Mesopotamia (943): these culminated in the reconquest of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] (944), which was especially celebrated for the return to Constantinople of the venerated ''[[Mandylion]]''. 

The soldier emperors [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (reigned 963<U+2013>969) and [[John I Tzimiskes]] (969<U+2013>976) expanded the empire well into [[Syria]], defeating the emirs of north-west [[Iraq]] and reconquering [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. At one point under John, the empire's armies even threatened [[Jerusalem]], far to the south. The emirate of [[Aleppo]] and its neighbours became vassals of the empire in the east, where the greatest threat to the empire was the Egyptian [[Fatimid]] kingdom.<ref name=Norwich />

===Wars against the Bulgarians===

{{details|Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars}}

[[Image:Basilios II.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Emperor Basil II the Bulgar Slayer (976<U+2013>1025).]]

The traditional struggle with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]] continued, spurred by the question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianized Bulgaria. This prompted an invasion by the powerful [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] in 894, but this was pushed back by the Byzantine diplomacy, which called on the help of the Hungarians. The Byzantines were in turn defeated, however, at the [[Battle of Bulgarophygon]] (896), and obliged to pay annual subsides to the Bulgarians. Later (912) Simeon even had the Byzantines grant him the crown of ''basileus'' of Bulgaria and had the young emperor [[Constantine VII]] marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered [[Edirne|Adrianople]].<ref name=Norwich />

A great imperial expedition under [[Leo Phocas]] and [[Romanos I|Romanos Lekapenos]] ended again with a crushing Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Anchialus]] (917), and the following year the Bulgarians were free to ravage northern Greece up to [[Corinth]]. Adrianople was captured again in 923 and in 924 a Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople. The situation in the Balkans improved only after Simeon's death in 927.

Under the emperor [[Basil II]] (reigned 976<U+2013>1025), the Bulgarians, who had conquered much of the Balkans from the Byzantines since their arrival three hundred years previously, became the target of annual campaigns by the Byzantine army. The war was to drag on for nearly twenty years, but eventually at the [[Battle of Kleidon]] the Bulgarians were completely defeated.<ref name=Angold>Angold (1997)</ref> The Bulgarian army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the remaining hundredth man left with one eye so as to lead his compatriots home. When Tsar [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]] saw the broken remains of his once gallant army, he died of shock. In 1018 Bulgaria surrendered and became part of the empire. This stunning victory restored the [[Danube]] frontier, which had not been held since the days of the emperor Heraclius.<ref name=Norwich />

The empire also gained a new ally at this time in the new [[Varangian]] state in [[Kiev]], from which the empire received an important mercenary force, the famous [[Varangian Guard]], in exchange for the marriage of Basil's sister Anna to [[Vladimir I of Kiev]].<ref name=Norwich /> During this period the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]], wife of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Otto II]], served as regent of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], paving the way for the westward spread of Byzantine culture.

===Triumph===
[[Image:Map Byzantine Empire 1045.svg|thumb|310px|The Byzantine Empire and its themata during the 11th century. At this point, the Empire was the most powerful in the mediterranean.]]

The Byzantine Empire now stretched to [[Armenia]] in the east, to [[Calabria]] in [[Southern Italy]] in the west.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of [[Bulgaria]], to the annexation of parts of [[Georgia(country)|Georgia]] and Armenia, to the total annihilation of an invading force of Egyptians outside [[Antioch]]. Yet even these victories were not enough; Basil considered the continued [[Arab]] occupation of [[Sicily]] to be an outrage. Accordingly, he planned to reconquer the island, which had belonged to the empire for over 300 years (c. 550 <U+2013> c. 900). However, his death in 1025 put an end to the project.<ref name=Norwich />

The 11th century was also momentous for its religious events. In 1054, relations between Greek-speaking Eastern and Latin-speaking Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on [[July 16]], when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during [[Divine Liturgy]] on a Saturday afternoon and placed a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[excommunication]] on the altar, the so-called [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Although the schism was brought about by doctrinal disputes (in particular, Eastern refusal to accept the Western Church doctrine of the ''[[filioque]]'', or double procession of the [[Holy Spirit]]), disputes over administration and political issues had simmered for centuries. The formal separation of the Byzantine [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and the Western [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] would have wide ranging consequences for the future of Byzantium.

==Crisis and fragmentation==
[[Image:Romanos et Eudoxie.JPG|thumb|Diptych of Romanos and [[Eudocia Macrembolitissa]] crowned by Christ ([[Biblioth<U+00E8>que nationale de France]], [[Paris]]).]]
Byzantium soon fell into a period of difficulties, caused to a large extent by the undermining of the theme system and the neglect of the military. Nikephoros II, John Tzimiskes and Basil II changed the military divisions ({{polytonic|<U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03B3><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1>}}, ''[[Tagma (military)|tagmata]]'') from a rapid response, primarily defensive, citizen army into a professional, campaigning army increasingly manned by mercenaries. Mercenaries, however, were expensive and as the threat of invasion receded in the 10th century, so did the need for maintaining large garrisons and expensive fortifications.<ref>Treadgold (1997), 548<U+2013>549</ref> Basil II left a burgeoning treasury upon his death, but neglected to plan for his succession. None of his immediate successors had any particular military or political talent and the administration of the Empire increasingly fell into the hands of the civil service. Efforts to revive the Byzantine economy only resulted in inflation and a debased gold coinage. The army was now seen as both an unnecessary expense and a political threat. Therefore, native troops were cashiered and replaced by foreign mercenaries on specific contract.<ref name="PM">Markham, [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/markham.htm The Battle of Manzikert]</ref> 
[[Image:Italy 1000 AD.svg|thumb|left|Map of Italy on the eve of the arrival of the Normans.]]
At the same time, the Empire was faced with new, ambitious enemies. Byzantine provinces in southern Italy faced the [[Normans]], who arrived in Italy at the beginning of the 11th century. The allied forces of [[Melus of Bari]] and the Normans were defeated at the [[Battle of Cannae (1018)|Battle of Cannae]] in 1018, and two decades later [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] equipped an expedition for the reconquest of Sicily from the Arabs. Although the campaign was initially successful, the reconquest of Sicily was not accomplished, mainly because [[George Maniaces]], the commander of the Byzantine forces, was recalled when he was suspected of having ambitious schemes. During a period of strife between Byzantium and Rome which ended in the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054, the Normans began to advance, slowly but steadily, into Byzantine Italy.<ref>Vasiliev, [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0832/_P17.HTM Relations with Italy and Western Europe]</ref> 

It was in Asia Minor, however, that the greatest disaster would take place. The [[Seljuq Turks]] made their first explorations across the Byzantine frontier into Armenia in 1065 and in 1067. The emergency lent weight to the military aristocracy in Anatolia who, in 1068, secured the election of one of their own, [[Romanos IV|Romanos Diogenes]], as emperor. In the summer of 1071, Romanos undertook a massive eastern campaign to draw the Seljuks into a general engagement with the Byzantine army. At [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] Romanos not only suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of [[Sultan]] [[Alp Arslan]], but was also captured. Alp Arslan treated him with respect, and imposed no harsh terms on the Byzantines.<ref name="PM" /> In Constantinople, however, a coup took place in favor of [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael Doukas]], who soon faced the opposition of [[Nikephoros Bryennios]] and [[Nikephoros III|Nikephoros Botaneiates]]. By 1081 the Seljuks expanded their rule over virtually the entire Anatolian plateau from Armenia in the east to [[Bithynia]] in the west and founded their capital in Nicea.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Empire|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|date=2002}}<br />* Markham, [http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/markham.htm The Battle of Manzikert]</ref>

After Manzikert, a partial recovery (referred to as the [[Komnenian restoration]]) was made possible by the efforts of the [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]].<ref name="M124">Magdalino (2002), 124</ref> The first emperor of this royal line was [[Isaac I Komnenos|Isaac I]] (1057<U+2013>1059) and the second Alexios I. At the very outset of his reign, Alexios faced a formidable attack by the Normans under [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]], who captured [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]]. Robert Guiscard's death in 1085 temporarily eased the Norman problem. The following year the Seljuq sultan died, and the sultanate was split by internal rivalries. By his own efforts, Alexios defeated the [[Pechenegs]]; they were caught by surprise and annihilated at the [[Battle of Levounion]] on [[28 April]] [[1091]].<ref name="Br" />

Having achieved stability in the West, Alexios could turn his attention to the severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier (2002)</ref> However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in [[Asia Minor]], and to advance against the Seljuks. At the [[Council of Piacenza]] in 1095, Alexios' envoys spoke to [[Pope Urban II]] about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule. Urban saw Alexius' request as a dual opportunity to cement Western Europe and enhance papal power.<ref name=Harris>Harris (2003)<br />* Read (2003), 124<br />* Watson (1993), 12</ref> On [[27 November]], [[1095]], [[Pope Urban II]] called together the [[Council of Clermont]], and urged all those present to take up arms under the sign of the [[Christian cross|Cross]] and launch an armed [[pilgrimage]] to recover Jerusalem and the East from the Muslims.

Alexios had anticipated help in the form of mercenary forces from the West, but was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force which soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexius to learn that four of the eight leaders of the main body of the Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might conquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides and a military escort.<ref name=A261>Anna Komnene, X, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/AnnaComnena-Alexiad10.html 261]</ref> Alexios was able to recover a number of important cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of [[Antioch]] (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch, but had been persuaded to turn back by [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed).<ref name="A291">Anna Komnene, XI, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/annacomnena-alexiad11.html 291]</ref> Bohemund, who had set himself up as [[Prince of Antioch]], briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the [[Treaty of Devol]] in 1108, which marked the end of Norman threat during Alexios' reign.<ref name="A348-358">Anna Komnene, XIII, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/annacomnena-alexiad13.html 348<U+2013>358]<br />* Birkenmeier (2002), 46</ref>

Alexios reconstituted the army and navy, but only by means of stabilizing the gold coinage at one-third of its original value and by imposing supplementary taxes. The supply of native soldiers had virtually ceased with the disappearance or absorption of their military holdings. Alexios promoted an alternative source of native manpower by extending the system of granting estates in ''[[pronoia]]'' (by favour of the emperor) and tying the grant to a military obligation. Similarly, Alexios tried to promote more profitable development of the estates of the church by granting them to the management of laymen.<ref name="Br" /> The final years of Alexios's reign were marked by persecution of the followers of the [[Paulician]] and [[Bogomil]] heresies, and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife [[Irene Doukaina]] wished to alter in favor of her daughter [[Anna Komnene|Anna]]'s husband, [[Nikephoros Bryennios]].<ref name=Kean>Garland (2006), 126<br />* Runciman (1982), 72</ref>

===John II, Manuel I and the Second Crusade===
{{main|John II Komnenos|Manuel I Komnenos}}
[[Image:JohnIIcomnenus.jpg|left|thumb|John II Komnenos left the imperial treasury full, and did not call for the execution or maiming of a single subject during his reign. Nicknamed 'John the Good', he is regarded by the Byzantine historian [[Niketas Choniates]] as the best emperor of the Komnenian dynasty.<ref name="SJ" />]]

Alexios' son [[John II Komnenos]] succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. John was a pious and dedicated emperor who was determined to undo the damage his empire had suffered at the [[battle of Manzikert]], half a century earlier.<ref>Norwich (1998), 267</ref> Famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign, John was an exceptional example of a moral ruler, at a time when cruelty was the norm.<ref>Ostrogorsky (1990), 377</ref> For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine [[Marcus Aurelius]]. In the course of his twenty-five year reign, John made alliances with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the west, decisively defeated the [[Pechenegs]] at the [[Battle of Beroia]],<ref name="B90">Birkenmeier (2002), 90</ref> and personally led numerous campaigns against the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]]. John's campaigns fundamentally changed the balance of power in the east, forcing the Turks onto the defensive and restoring to the Byzantines many towns, fortresses and cities right across the peninsula.<ref name="SJ">Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/johncomn.htm John II Komnenos]</ref> He also thwarted Hungarian, and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 allied himself with the [[List of German monarchs|German emperor]] [[Lothair III]] against the Norman King [[Roger II of Sicily]].<ref name="BrJ">{{cite encyclopedia|title=John II Komnenos|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> In the later part of his reign John focused his activities on the East. He defeated the [[Danishmend]] emirate of [[Melitene]], and reconquered all of [[Cilicia]], while forceing [[Raymond of Poitiers]], Prince of Antioch, to recognize Byzantine suzerainty. In an effort to demonstrate the Byzantine emperor's role as the leader of the [[Christian]] world, John marched into the [[Holy Land]] at the head of the combined forces of Byzantium and the [[Crusade]]r states; yet despite the great vigour with which he pressed the campaign, John's hopes were disappointed by the treachery of his Crusader allies.<ref>Harris (2003), 84</ref> In 1142 John returned to press his claims to Antioch, but he died in the spring of 1143 following a hunting accident. Raymond was emboldened to invade Cilicia, but he was defeated and forced to go to Constantinople to beg mercy from the new emperor.<ref name="B326">Brooke (2004), 326</ref>

[[Image:The Byzantine Empire, c.1180.PNG|thumb|310px|Byzantine Empire in purple, c.1180, at the end of the Komnenian period.]]

John's chosen heir was his fourth son, [[Manuel I Komnenos]], who campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east. In Palestine, he allied himself with the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of [[Fatimid Egypt]]. Manuel reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with [[Raynald of Chatillon|Raynald]], Prince of Antioch, and [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], King of Jerusalem respectively.<ref name="S">Magdalino (2002), 74<br />* Stone, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/mannycom.htm Manuel I Comnenus]</ref> In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to Italy in 1155, but disputes within the coalition led to the eventual failure of the campaign. Despite this military setback, Manuel's armies successfully invaded the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the [[Battle of Sirmium]]. By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel's hands.<ref name="S372">Sedlar (1994), 372</ref> Manuel made several alliances with the Pope and Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the [[Second Crusade]] through his empire.<ref name="M67">Magdalino (2002), 67</ref> Although hopes for a lasting Papal-Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems, Pope [[Innocent III]] clearly had a positive view of Manuel when he told [[Alexios III]] that he should imitate "your predecessor Manuel of famous memory" who "always replied favourably to ourselves and our predecessors".<ref name="I121">Innocent III, [http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:odrBpiY1vR4J:www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/Letters%2520of%2520Innocent.doc+Letters+of+Pope+Innocent+III+concerning+the+Fourth+Crusade&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1 Letter to the Illustrious Emperor of Constantinople (no 121)]</ref> 

In the east, however, Manuel suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]], in 1176, against the Turks. Yet the losses were quickly made good, and in the following year Manuel's forces inflicted a defeat upon a force of "picked Turks".<ref name="B129">Birkenmeier (2002), 128</ref> John Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion, not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way; a sign that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western Asia Minor was still successful.<ref name="B196">Birkenmeier (2002), 196</ref>

John and Manuel pursued active military policies, and both deployed considerable resources on sieges and on city defenses; aggressive fortification policies were at the heart of their imperial military policies.<ref name="B185-186">Birkenmeier (2002), 185<U+2013>186</ref> Despite the defeat at Myriokephalon, the policies of Alexios, John and Manuel resulted in vast territorial gains, increased frontier stability in Asia Minor, and secured the stabilization of the empire's European frontiers.

This allowed the Western provinces to achieve an economic revival which continued until the close of the century. It has been argued that Byzantium under the Komnenian rule was more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasions of the 7th century. During the 12th century population levels rose and extensive tracts of new agricultural land were brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a notable upsurge in new towns. Trade was also flourishing; the Venetians, the [[Genoa|Genoese]] and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and [[Fatimid Egypt]] to the west and trading with the Byzantine Empire via Constantinople.<ref name="Day">Day (1977), 289<U+2013>290<br />* Harvey (1998)</ref>

In artistic terms, there was a revival in [[mosaic]], and regional schools of [[architecture]] began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.<ref name=Diehl> Diehl, [http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/diel.html Byzantine Art]</ref> During the 12th century the Byzantines provided their model of early [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] as a renaissance of interest in classical authors.

Manuel's death on [[24 September]] [[1180]] left his 11-year-old son [[Alexios II Komnenos]] on the throne. Alexios was highly incompetent at the office, but it was his mother, [[Maria of Antioch]], and her Frankish background that made his regency unpopular.<ref name="Norwich291">Norwich (1998), 291</ref> Eventually [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], a grandson of Alexios I, launched a revolt against his younger relative and managed to overthrow him in a violent ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''.

This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.<ref name="M194">P. Magdalino (2002), 194</ref> The new emperor was a man of astounding contrasts.<ref name="M194">G.

Norwich, ''A short history of Byzantium'', 291</ref> However, he was also capable of terrifying brutality, violence and cruelty.<ref name="M194">G. Ostrogorsky, ''History of the Byzantine state'', 396</ref>

Andronikos began his reign well; in particular, the measures he took to reform the government of the empire have been praised by historians. According to [[George Ostrogorsky]], Andronikos was determined to root out corruption: Under his rule the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favoritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. In the provinces Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.<ref name="M194" /> The people felt the severity of his laws, but acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors.<ref name="M194">G. Ostrogorsky, ''History of the Byzantine state'', 397</ref> Andronikos' efforts to rein in the oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry, but his attempt to check the power of the nobility was considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated against him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly unbalanced; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror.<ref>J.Harris, ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', 118</ref> Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, while the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.<ref name="M194">G. Ostrogorsky, ''History of the Byzantine state'', 397</ref> 

Despite his military background, Andronikos failed to deal with [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], [[B<U+00E9>la III of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la III]] who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and [[Stephen Nemanja]] of Serbia who declared his independence from Byzantium. Yet none of these troubles would compare to [[William II of Sicily]]'s invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185.<ref name="Norwich293">Norwich (1998), 293</ref> Andronikos mobilized a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital but other than that he was indifferent to the populace.

[[Image:Schnorr von Carolsfeld - Die Schlacht von Iconium.jpg|right|thumb|Iconium is won by the Third Crusade.]]
The reign of Isaac II, and, still more, that of his brother [[Alexios III]], saw the collapse of what remained of the centralized machinery of Byzantine government and defense. Although, the Normans were driven out of Greece, in 1186 the Bulgars began a rebellion that was to lead to the formation of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. The mismanagement of the [[Third Crusade]] clearly demonstrated Byzantium's weaknesses under the Angeli. When [[Richard I of England]] appropriated [[Cyprus]] from its ruler, [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], he refused to hand it back to the Empire,<ref name="Norwich296">Norwich (1998), 296</ref> And when [[Frederick Barbarossa]] conquered [[Iconium]], Isaac failed to seize the initiative.<ref name="Madden85">T. Madden, ''Crusades'', 85<br>* Norwich (1998), 297</ref> The internal policy of the Angeloi was characterized by the squandering of the public treasure, and the fiscal maladministration.

After the death of [[Theobald III, Count of Champagne]], the leadership of the Crusade passed to [[Boniface of Montferrat]], a friend of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] [[Philip of Swabia]]. Both Boniface and Philip had married into the Byzantine imperial family. In fact, Philip's brother-in-law, [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]], son of the deposed and blinded emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]], had appeared in Europe seeking aid and had made contacts with the crusaders. Alexios offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders 200,000 silver marks, and join the crusade with 200,000 silver marks and all the supplies they needed to get to Egypt.<ref name="Norwich301">Norwich (1998), 301</ref> Innocent was aware of a plan to divert the Crusade to Constantinople, and forbade any attack on the city; but the papal letter arrived after the fleets had left Zara.

When in late November 1203 Alexios IV announced that his promises were hard to keep as the empire was short on funds (he had managed to pay roughly half of the promised amount of 200,000 silver marks, and could not fulfil his promise that he would cover the Venetians' rent of the fleet for the crusaders.<ref name="Madden110">Madden (2005), 110</ref>), the crusaders declared war on him.

===Empire in exile===
[[Image:1263.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Middle East c. 1263]]
After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin [[Crusaders]], three Byzantine [[successor state]]s were established: the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. Of these three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood the best chance of reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled, however, to survive the next few decades, and by the mid 13th century it lost much of southern Anatolia.<ref>Kean (2005)<br>* Madden (2005), 162<br>* Lowe-Baker, [http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm The Seljuks of Rum]</ref> The weakening of the Sultanate of Rum following the [[Battle of K<U+00F6>se Dag|Mongol Invasion in 1242-43]] allowed many [[Beyliks]] and fanatical ''ghazis'' to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor.<ref>Lowe-Baker, [http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm The Seljuks of Rum]</ref> In time, one of the Beys, [[Osman I]], created an empire that would conquer Byzantium. However, the Mongol Invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire only north of its position.

===Reconquest of Constantinople===
[[Image:Byzantium1375.png|thumb|250px|Map of the Middle East c.1350. Byzantium has lost its territory in Asia Minor and Epirus has been reduced significantly by Serbia. Ottoman lands are in purple, and Red Byzantium.]]
The Empire of Nicaea, founded by the [[Laskaris]], managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a short lived revival of Byzantine fortunes under [[Michael VIII]], but the war-ravaged empire was ill-equipped to deal with the enemies that now surrounded it. In order to maintain his campaigns against the Latins, Michael pulled troops from Asia Minor, and levied crippling taxes on the peasantry, causing much resentment.<ref>Madden (2005), 179<br>* Reinert (2002), 260</ref> Massive construction projects were completed in Constantinople to repair the damages of the Fourth Crusade, but none of these initiatives was of any comfort to the farmers in Asia Minor, suffering raids from fanatical ghazis. 

Rather than holding on to his possessions in Asia Minor, Michael chose to expand the Empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople.<ref>Reinert (2002), 257</ref> The efforts of [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]] and later his grandson [[Andronikos III Palaiologos|Andronikos III]] marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring the glory of the empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the [[Catalan Company]] ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople<ref>Reinert (2002), 261</ref> By 1390, [[Ala<U+015F>ehir|Philadelphia]], the last Byzantine stronghold in inner Asia Minor, fell to the Turks. 

Civil war wrecked the empire during the 14th century, since Andronikos III's successor was far too young to rule and the resulting regency's rivalry tore the Empire. The Asian provinces were lost to the Turks, while the Serbians and Bulgarians conquered the Empire's remaining territory in Europe. For a while, the empire survived simply because the Turks of Anatolia were too divided to attack. Nevertheless, the unifying influence of [[Osman I]] (1258<U+2013>1326) allowed the newly founded [[Ottoman Empire]] to deprive the Byzantines of all but a handful of port cities.<ref name=Kean>Kean (2005)</ref>

Things went worse for Byzantium, when, during the civil war, an earthquake at Gallipoli in 1354 devastated the fort, allowing the Turks the very next day to cross into Europe.<ref>Reinert (2002), 268</ref> By the time the Byzantine civil war had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals. Following the [[Battle of Kosovo]], much of the Balkans became dominated by the Ottomans.<ref>Reinert (2002), 270</ref>
[[Image:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|250px|left|Eastern Mediterranean just before the fall of Constantinople.]]
The Emperors appealed to the west for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid in return for a reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented Roman authority and the [[Latin Rite]].<ref>Runciman (1990), 71-72</ref> Some western mercenaries arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.<ref name="R84-85">Runciman (1990), 84-85</ref>

Constantinople by this stage was underpopulated and dilapidated. The population of the city had collapsed so severely that it was now little more than a cluster of villages separated by fields. On [[April 2]], [[1453]], the Sultan's army of some 80,000 men and his hordes of irregulars laid siege to the city.<ref name="R84-86">Runciman (1990), 84-86</ref> Despite a desperate last-ditch defense of the city by the massively outnumbered Christian forces (c. 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreign mercenaries<ref name="R84-85" />), [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople finally fell]] to the Ottomans after a two-month siege on [[May 29]], [[1453]]. The last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI]] Palaiologos, was last seen casting off his imperial regalia and throwing himself into hand-to-hand combat after the walls of the city were taken.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Constantinople 1453.jpg|thumb|left|The siege of Constantinople in 1453 according to a 15th century French miniature.]]
[[Mehmed II]] went on to conquer the Greek statelets of [[Mistra]] in 1460 and [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] in 1461. The nephew of the last Emperor, Constantine XI, [[Andreas Palaeologos]] had inherited the defunct title of [[Byzantine Emperor]] and used it from 1465 until his death in 1503.<ref name="Helios" /> By the end of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had established its firm rule over Asia Minor and parts of the Balkan peninsula. Mehmed II and his successors continued to consider themselves proper heirs to the Byzantine Empire until the demise of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. Meanwhile, the [[Danubian Principalities]] harbored Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.

At his death, the role of the emperor as a patron of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was claimed by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand Duke]] of [[Muscovy]]. He had married Andreas' sister, [[Sophia Paleologue]], whose grandson, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], would become the first [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]] (''tsar'', or ''czar'', meaning ''[[Caesar (title)|caesar]]'', is a term traditionally applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that [[Moscow]] was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The idea of the [[Russian Empire]] as the new, [[Third Rome]] was kept alive until its demise with the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].<ref>Seton-Watson (1967), 31</ref>

===Economy===
{{details|Byzantine economy}}
The Byzantine economy was among the most advanced in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, was unable to match Byzantine economic strength until late in the Middle Ages. Constantinople was a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of [[Eurasia]] and [[North Africa]], in particular being the primary western terminus of the famous ''[[silk road]]''. Some scholars argue that, up until the arrival of the Arabs in the 7th century, the Empire had the most powerful economy in the world. The [[Muslim conquests|Arab conquests]], however, would represent a substantial reversal of fortunes contributing to a period of decline and stagnation. Constantine V's reforms (c. 765) marked the beginning of a revival that continued until 1204. From the 10th century until the end of the 12th, the Byzantine Empire projected an image of luxury, and the travelers were impressed by the wealth accumulated in the capital. All this changed with the arrival of the Fourth Crusade, which was an economic catastrophe.<ref name="M532">Magdalino ''in Laiou'' (2002), {{PDFlink|[http://www.doaks.org/EconHist/EHB20.pdf 532]|519&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 531963 bytes -->}}</ref> The [[Palaiologoi]] tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.<ref name="M806">Matschke (2002), {{PDFlink|[http://www.doaks.org/EconHist/EHB37.pdf 805<U+2013>806]|255&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 262093 bytes -->}}</ref> [[Image:Solidus-Justinian II-Christ b-sb1413.jpg|thumb|left|''Solidus'' of [[Justinian II]], second reign, after 705]]

One of the economic foundations of the empire was trade. Textiles must have been by far the most important item of export; [[silk]]s were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West.<ref name="L723">Laiou (2002), {{PDFlink|[http://www.doaks.org/EconHist/EHB36.pdf 723]|463&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 474534 bytes -->}}</ref> The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing [[Byzantine coinage|coinage]]. The government exercised formal control over interest rates, and set the parameters for the activity of the [[guild]]s and corporations, in which it had a special interest. The emperor and its officials intervened at times of crisis to ensure the provisioning of the capital, and to keep down the price of [[cereals]]. Finally, the government often collected part of the surplus through taxation, and put it back into circulation, through redistribution in the form of salaries to state officials, or in the form of investment in public works.<ref name="L3-4">Laiou (2002), {{PDFlink|[http://www.doaks.org/EconHist/EHB01.pdf 3<U+2013>4]|77.5&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 79449 bytes -->}}</ref>

===Science, Medicine, Law===
[[Image:ViennaDioscoridesFolio3v7Physicians.jpg|thumb|left|The frontispiece of the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], which shows a set of seven famous [[physician]]s.]]
{{details|Byzantine science}}
{{Seealso|Byzantine medicine|Byzantine law}}
The writings of [[Classical antiquity]] never ceased to be cultivated in Byzantium. Therefore, Byzantine science was in every period closely connected with [[ancient philosophy]], and [[metaphysics]].<ref>Anastos (1962), 409</ref> Although at various times the Byzantines made magnificent achievements in the application of the [[Science in the Middle Ages|sciences]] (notably in the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), after the 6th century Byzantine scholars made few novel contributions to science in terms of developing new theories or extending the ideas of classical authors.<ref>Cohen (1994), 395<br>* Dickson, [http://www.roma.unisa.edu.au/07305/medmm.htm Mathematics Through the Middle Ages]</ref> Scholarship particularly lagged during the dark years of [[Plague of Justinian|plague]] and the Arab conquests, but then during the so-called ''Byzantine Renaissance'' at the end of the first millennium Byzantine scholars re-asserted themselves becoming experts in the scientific developments of the Arabs and Persians, particularly in [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].<ref>King (1991), 116-118</ref>

In the final century of the Empire, Byzantine grammarians were those principally responsible for carrying, in person and in writing, ancient Greek grammatical and literary studies to early [[Renaissance Italy]].<ref>Robins (1993), 8</ref> During this period [[astronomy]] and other [[mathematics|mathematical sciences]] were taught in Trebizond; medicine attracted the interest of almost all scholars.<ref name="TM189">Tatakes-Moutafakis (2003), 189</ref>

In the field of law, [[Justinian I]]'s reforms had a clear effect on the evolution of [[jurisprudence]], and Leo III's ''Ecloga'' influenced the formation of legal institutions in the Slav world.<ref>Troianos-Velissaropoulou (1997), 340</ref>

===Religion===
{{further|[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]}}

[[Image:Aya sofya.jpg|thumb|As a symbol and expression of the universal prestige of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Justinian built the Church of the Holy Wisdom of God, [[Hagia Sophia]], which was completed in the short period of four and a half years (532<U+2013>537).]]

According to [[Joseph Raya]], "Byzantine culture and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] are one and the same."<ref>Raya, [http://rumkatkilise.org/rayabyzantium.htm#cooliris The Byzantine Church and Culture]</ref> The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the Emperor in the affairs of the Church. The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative, and financial routine of administering religious affairs, and this routine was applied to the [[Christian Church]]. Following the pattern set by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], the Byzantines thought of the Emperor as a representative or messenger of [[Jesus|Christ]], responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans, and for the "externals" of the religion, such as administration and finances. The imperial role, however, in the affairs of the Church never developed into a fixed, legally defined system.<ref name="M14">Meyendorff (1982), 13</ref>

With the decline of Rome, and internal dissension in the other Eastern patriarchates, the church of Constantinople became, between the 6th and 11th centuries, the richest and most influential center of [[Christendom]].<ref name="M19">Meyendorff (1982), 19</ref> Even when the Empire was reduced to only a shadow of itself, the Church, as an institution, had never exercised so much influence both inside and outside of the imperial frontiers. As [[George Ostrogorsky]] points out:
<blockquote>The [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] remained the center of the Orthodox world, with subordinate metropolitan sees and archbishoprics in the territory of Asia Minor and the Balkans, now lost to Byzantium, as well as in [[Caucasus]], Russia and [[Lithuania]]. The Church remained the most stable element in the Byzantine Empire.<ref name="M130">Meyendorff (1982), 130</ref></blockquote>

However, there were some non-Christian minorities in Byzantium, most notably [[Jews of Byzantium|Jews]].

===Art and literature===
{{main|Byzantine art|Byzantine literature}}
{{seealso|Byzantine music|Byzantine dress}}
[[Image:RabulaGospelsFol13vAscension.jpg|thumb|left|Miniatures of the 6th-century [[Rabula Gospel]] display the more abstract and symbolic nature of Byzantine art.]]
[[Byzantine architecture|Architecture]], [[painting]], and other visual arts produced in the Byzantine Empire and in various areas that came under its influence. Byzantine art is almost entirely concerned with religious expression and, more specifically, with the impersonal translation of carefully controlled church theology into artistic terms. Byzantine forms were spread by trade and conquest to Italy and Sicily, where they persisted in modified form through the 12th century, and became formative influences on [[Italian Renaissance]] art. By means of the expansion of the Eastern Orthodox church, Byzantine forms spread to eastern European centers, particularly Russia.<ref name="BAr">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Art|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> Influences from Byzantine architecture, particularly in religious buildings, can be found in diverse regions from Egypt and Arabia to Russia and Romania.

In Byzantine literature, therefore, four different cultural elements are to be reckoned with: the [[Greek literature|Greek]], the Christian, the [[Latin literature|Roman]], and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopedists (Patriarch Photios, [[Michael Psellos]], and [[Michael Choniates]] are regarded as the greatest encyclopedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry (The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Acritas]]''). The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry. Of the approximately two to three thousand volumes of Byzantine literature that survive, only three hundred and thirty consist of secular poetry, history, science and pseudo-science.<ref>Mango (1980), 233<U+2013>4</ref> While the most flourishing period of the secular literature of Byzantium runs from the ninth to the twelfth century, its religious literature ([[sermon]]s, [[liturgical book]]s and poetry, theology, devotional treatises etc.) developed much earlier with [[Romanos]] the Melodist being its most prominent representative.<ref name="CLi">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Byzantine Literature|encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03113a.htm}}</ref>

===Government and bureaucracy===

|}
{{seealso|Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy}}
In the Byzantine state, the [[List of Byzantine Emperors|emperor]] was the sole and absolute ruler, and his power was regarded as having divine origin.<ref name="Helios" /> By the end of the 8th century, a civil administration focused on the court was formed as part of a large-scale consolidation of power in the capital (the rise to pre-eminence of the position of ''[[sakellarios]]'' is related to this change).<ref name="L291">Louth (2005), 291<br />* Neville (2004), 7</ref> The most important reform of this period is the creation of themes, where civil and military administration is exercised by one person, the ''[[strategos]]''.<ref name="Helios" />

Despite the occasionally [[Derogatory use of "Byzantine"|derogatory use of the word "Byzantine"]], the Byzantine bureaucracy had a distinct ability for reinventing itself in accordance with the Empire's situation. The Byzantine system of titulature and precedence makes the imperial administration look like an ordered bureaucracy to modern observers. Officials were arranged in strict order around the emperor, and depended upon the imperial will for their ranks. There were also actual administrative jobs, but authority could be vested in individuals rather than offices.<ref name="L34">Neville (2004), 34</ref> In the 8th and 9th centuries civil service constituted the clearest path to aristocratic status, but, starting in the 9th century, the civil aristocracy was rivaled by an aristocracy of nobility. According to some studies of Byzantine government, 11th-century politics were dominated by competition between the civil and the military aristocracy. During this period, Alexios I undertook important administrative reforms, including the creation of new courtly dignities and offices.<ref name="L13">Neville (2004), 13</ref>

===Diplomacy===

After the fall of Rome, the key challenge to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its sundry neighbors. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they were dependent on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbors into a network of international and inter-state relations.<ref name="N1">Neumann (2006), 869<U+2013>871</ref> This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and the assimilation of Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions.<ref>Chrysos (1992), 35</ref> Byzantines regarded diplomacy as a form of war by other means: the ''[[Bureau of Barbarians]]'' was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire's rivals from every imaginable source.<ref name="Ant">Antonucci (1993), 11<U+2013>13</ref>

Byzantines availed themselves of a number of diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions where he came from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays.<ref name="N1" /> According to [[Dimitri Obolensky]], the preservation of civilization in [[Eastern Europe]] was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.<ref name="O3">Obolensky (1994), 3</ref>

Owing its origins to Rome the original language of the Empire was Latin and this continued to be its official language until the 7th century AD when it was changed to Greek by Heraclius. Scholarly Latin would rapidly fall into disuse among the educated classes although the language would continue to be at least a ceremonial part of the Empire's culture for some time.<ref name="ApWr">Apostolides (1992), 25-26<br>* Wroth (1908), Introduction, section 6, cv</ref> Additionally [[Vulgar Latin|common Latin]] continued to be a minority language in the Empire which many scholars believe gave birth to the [[Eastern Romance languages|Vlach languages]].<ref>Saramandru, [http://www.ear.ro/3brevist/rv8/art14.pdf Torna, Torna Fratre]<br>* Sedlar (1994), 403-404</ref>

Apart from the Imperial court, though, the primary language used in the eastern Roman provinces (i.e. the Eastern Roman Empire) even before the [[decline of the Roman Empire|decline of the Western Empire]] had always been Greek.<ref>Millar (2006), 279</ref> Indeed early on in the life of the Roman Empire Greek had become the common language in the Christian Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations.<ref>Bryce (1901), 59<br>* McDonnell (2006), 77<br>* Millar (2006), 97-98</ref> The language itself for a time gained a [[Diglossia|dual nature]] with the primary spoken language, [[Koine Greek|Koine]], existing alongside an older [[Attic Greek|literary language]] with Koine eventually evolving into the standard dialect.<ref>''Greek Language'', Encyclopedia Britannica</ref>

Many other languages existed in the multi-ethnic Empire as well, and some of these were given limited official status in their provinces at various times. Notably, by the beginning of the Middle Ages, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] had become more widely used by the educated classes in the far eastern provinces.<ref name="BJVe">Beaton (1996), 10<br>* Jones (1986), 991<br>* Versteegh (1977), Chapter 1</ref> Similarly [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] became significant among the educated in their provinces,<ref>Campbell (2004), 40<br>* Hacikyan (2002), part 1</ref> and later foreign contacts made the [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]], Vlach, and [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] languages important in the Empire and its sphere of influence.<ref>Baynes (1907), 289<br>* Gutas (1998), Chapter 7, section 4<br>*  Shopen (1987), 129</ref>

Aside from these, since Constantinople was a prime trading center in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] and beyond, virtually every known language of the Middle Ages was spoken in the Empire at some time, even [[Chinese language|Chinese]].<ref>Beckwith (1986), 171<br>* Halsall(2006)</ref> As the Empire entered its final decline the Empire's citizens became more culturally homogeneous and the Greek language became synonymous with their identity and their religion.<ref>''Greece during the Byzantine period (c. AD 300<U+2013>c. 1453), Population and languages, Emerging Greek identity'', Encyclopedia Britannica<br>* Kaldellis (2008), Chapter 6<br>* Nicol (1993), Chapter 5</ref>

===Legacy===
As the only stable long-term state in Europe during the Middle Ages, Byzantium isolated Western Europe from newly emerging forces to the East. Constantly under attack, it distanced Western Europe from Persians, Arabs, Seljuk Turks, and for a time, the Ottomans. The Byzantine-Arab Wars, for example, are recognized by some historians as being a key factor behind the rise of [[Charlemagne]],<ref name="Pirenne">[[Henri Pirenne|Pirenne, Henri]]

For centuries, [[Western World|Western]] historians have used the terms ''Byzantine'' and ''Byzantinism'' [[derogatory use of "Byzantine"|as bywords for decadence, duplicitous politics and complex bureaucracy]], and there was a strongly negative assessment of Byzantine civilization and its legacy in [[Southeastern Europe]].<ref name="A1">Angelov (2001), 1</ref> ''Byzantinism'' in general was defined as a body of religious, political, and philosophical ideas which ran contrary to those of the West.<ref name="A7-8">Angelov (2001), 7-8</ref> Similarly until the 20th century the term ''East'', in the context of ''Eastern'' and ''Western'' culture, was commonly used to refer to cultures that had strong influences from the Byzantine Empire (including by extension the Arabs and the Ottomans). The 20th and 21st centuries, however, have seen attempts by historians in the West to understand the Empire in a more balanced and accurate fashion including its influences on the West, and as a result the complex character of Byzantine culture has received more attention and a more objective treatment than previously.<ref name="A7-8" />
