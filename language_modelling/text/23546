'''Luol Deng''' (born April 16, 1985) is a British professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA).<ref name="HEAT Signs Luol Deng">{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/heat/news/heat-signs-luol-deng|title=HEAT Signs Luol Deng|publisher=NBA|date=July 15, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> He has also competed with the [[Great Britain national basketball team]]. A member of the [[Chicago Bulls]] from 2004 until 2014, Deng was selected for his first NBA All-Star game during the 2011<U+2013>12 season, joining teammate [[Derrick Rose]]. Born in what is now [[South Sudan]], Deng fled the country with his family as a child, moving to [[Egypt]] and then the [[United Kingdom]], becoming a British citizen in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Deng was born in [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]], [[Sudan]] (now [[South Sudan]]) and is a member of the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] ethnic group. When he was young, his father [[Aldo Deng|Aldo]], a member of the Sudanese parliament, moved the family to [[Egypt]] to escape the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/luol_deng/bio.html NBA.com : Luol Deng Bio Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Egypt, they met former NBA [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Manute Bol]], another [[Dinka]], who taught Deng's older brother, [[Ajou Deng]], how to play basketball while also serving as a mentor for Luol himself.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/rookies_040830.html BULLS: Triple Threat<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1448493,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Triumph and despair: Luol Deng | date=April 3, 2005 | accessdate=May 11, 2010 | first=Sam | last=Pilger}}</ref> When they were granted political asylum, his family emigrated to [[Brixton]], [[South London]].

At the age of 14, Luol moved to the United States to play basketball at [[Blair Academy]] in [[New Jersey]], where one of his teammates was future NBA player [[Charlie Villanueva]]. Deng was also named a Tri-Captain at Blair along with Villanueva. During his senior year, Deng was considered the second most promising high school senior in America after [[LeBron James]]. He was named First Team All-America by ''[[Parade Magazine]]'' and [[USA Today]], and was selected to play in the McDonald's High School All-America game,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> but could not play due to a foot injury.<ref>[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/032703/pre_124-4178.shtml "LeBron leads East to victory"], [[Associated Press|AP]] in ''[[Augusta Chronicle]]'', March 27, 2003.</ref><ref>[http://www.basketball365.co.uk/mcdonalds260303.htm "Luol Deng sidelined for McDonalds All-American game"], Basketball 365, March 26, 2003.</ref> After graduation, he decided to attend [[Duke University]]. In one season at Duke, he appeared in 37 games and made 32 starts. He averaged 30.1 minutes and scored 15.1 [[points per game]] en route to a berth in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004 Final Four]]. He is only the 10th freshman in ACC history to lead all rookies in scoring, rebounding, and field goal percentage.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bulls===

====2004<U+2013>05 season====
After one year at Duke, Deng entered the [[2004 NBA Draft]]. He was picked seventh overall by the [[Phoenix Suns]], but was immediately traded to the [[Chicago Bulls]] by prior agreement. Deng suffered a season-ending wrist injury late in his rookie season, but still made the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All-Rookie First Team]] to help the resurgent Bulls return to the playoffs for the first time in seven years. Deng played in 61 games and averaged 11.7 points per game. On February 8, Deng recorded his first [[double-double]] vs. the [[Dallas Mavericks]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200502080DAL.html |title=Chicago Bulls at Dallas Mavericks Box Score, February 8, 2005 |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>

====2005<U+2013>06 season====
In his second season, he posted strong performances throughout March and April to help the Bulls earn their second consecutive playoff berth. His offensive statistics improved in his sophomore season, increasing his scoring to 14.3 points per game, and increasing his rebounding to 6.6 per game, up from a 5.3 average his rookie season. Deng had four straight double-double performances from February 28 to March 5, with at least ten points and rebounds in each game. In the playoffs, the Bulls faced off against the [[Miami Heat]] in a best of 7 game series. Deng came off the bench in all six games, averaging ten points per game.

====2006<U+2013>07 season====
For the 2006<U+2013>07 season, Deng was the only Bull to start all 82 regular season games. All of his numbers continued to improve, and he led the team in minutes played (37.5) and field goal percentage (.517), while playing a strong second scoring option to [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], with a marked improvement to 18.8 points per game. Deng also notably rarely committed fouls on defense (2.00 per game), despite the minutes he played and frequently being outsized in match ups against power forwards such as [[Kevin Garnett]].

On December 27, 2006, Deng was driving in the lane when Miami Heat player [[James Posey]] grabbed him, causing concern that Deng may have re-injured his wrist. Posey earned a [[flagrant foul]], was ejected and suspended for one game. Deng scored 32 points against the Cavaliers just three nights later, resolving concern that the wrist would be re-injured. On March 26, 2007 Deng posted a new career-high 38 points to lead the Bulls to a home victory against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Deng converted 18 of his 25 shots from the field.

Deng has won three major sportsmanship awards. On May 3, 2007, Deng won the NBA's sportsmanship award in a vote by players. The award honors the player who best exemplifies ethical behavior, fair play, and integrity on the court. For that award, the league donated $25,000 on his behalf to [[Pacific Garden Mission]], the oldest continuously operating rescue mission in the country. Deng also won the 2006<U+2013>2007 Golden Icon Award for Best Sports Role Model. The awards are presented by the Travolta entertainment family.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=23866 |title=Patti LuPone & D'Monroe Among Travolta Family Award Winners

Near the beginning of the season, the Bulls started negotiating a contract extension for Deng. Negotiations were mostly handled by Bulls chairman [[Jerry Reinsdorf]].

====2011<U+2013>12 season: All-Star season====
Deng injured his wrist during the fourth quarter against the Charlotte Bobcats on January 21, 2012. Initially thought to be a minor injury, it was later revealed by an MRI that Deng tore the ligament in his left wrist. Deng decided to postpone surgery and play the rest of the season through the pain. He returned to the starting lineup against the Milwaukee Bucks on February 4, 2012, scoring 21 points with 9 rebounds, 1 steal, and 1 block.

On February 9, 2012, Deng was selected as a reserve for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game's Eastern Conference team, joining teammate Derrick Rose, who was voted in as a starter. This was the first time since 1997 (when both [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]] made the team) that the Chicago Bulls had two All-Stars in the All-Star Game.

Deng made a buzzer-beating game winner on March 24, 2012, off a tip-in basket to lift the Bulls 102<U+2013>101 in overtime versus the [[Toronto Raptors]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-nba-20120325,0,5002171.story |title=Luol Deng gives Bulls victory in overtime |author=AP|date=March 25, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Interactive, Inc. |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref> At the end of the season, Deng was selected for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team

====2012<U+2013>13 season: Second All-Star season====
Deng was selected as a reserve for the [[2013 NBA All-Star Game]], along with [[Joakim Noah]]. During the 2012<U+2013>13 season, he averaged a team high 16.5 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, and a career high 3 assists per game. His free throw percentage of .816 was also a career high. He again led the league in minutes per game with (38.7). Even without Derrick Rose, who was out for the whole year due to an ACL injury, the Bulls still tallied a 45<U+2013>37 record, finishing 5th in the Eastern Conference and 2nd in the Central Division.

The Chicago Bulls met the [[Brooklyn Nets]] in the opening round of the 2013 Playoffs. The Bulls defeated the Nets in seven games and met the [[Miami Heat]] in the semifinals. The Heat defeated the Bulls in five games. The Heat went on to win the 2013 NBA Finals. During the 2013 Playoffs, Deng averaged 13.8 points per game, 7.6 rebounds per game, and 3.8 assists per game in 44.8 minutes per game.

====2013<U+2013>14 season====

Deng's representatives and Chicago Bulls executives had informal talks about extending his contract over the summer, but the team never made a formal offer. Deng, who would become a free agent after the [[2013<U+2013>14 NBA season|2013<U+2013>14 season]], was seeking a contract close to $12 million a year over 4<U+2013>5 seasons. Rumors about him being traded continued throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=|title=Luol Deng rejected $30 million extension offer from Bulls before trade to Cavs|publisher=Yahoo!
