'''Transylvania''' is a historical region in the central part of [[Romania]]. Bounded on the east and south by the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain range]], historical Transylvania extended in the west to the [[Apuseni Mountains]]; however, the term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also the historical regions of [[Cri<U+0219>ana]], [[Maramure<U+0219>]], and [[Banat|Romanian part of Banat]].
The region of Transylvania is known for the scenic beauty of its [[Carpathians|Carpathian]] landscape and its rich [[History of Transylvania|history]]. In the English-speaking world it has been commonly associated with [[vampire]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afn.org/~vampires/tsd.html |title=Transylvania Society of Dracula Information |publisher=Afn.org |date=1995-05-29 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref><ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DE143BF931A1575BC0A965958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Travel Advisory; Lure of Dracula In Transylvania | date=1993-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icromania.com/infoTransylvania.asp |title=Romania Transylvania |publisher=Icromania.com |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref> chiefly due to the influence of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' as well as its later film adaptations and extensions.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Historical names of Transylvania}}
In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the region is known as ''Ardeal'' ({{IPA-ro|ar<U+02C8>de<U+032F>al|pron}}) or ''Transilvania'' ({{IPA-ro|transil<U+02C8>vani.a|pron}}); in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Erd<U+00E9>ly'' ({{IPA-hu|<U+025B>rde:j|pron}}); in [[German language|German]] as Siebenb<U+00FC>rgen ({{IPA-de|<U+02C8>zi:b<U+0259>n<U+02CC>b<U+028F>rg<U+0259>n|pron|De-Siebenb<U+00FC>rgen.ogg}}); and in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''Transilvanya'' ({{IPA-tr|t<U+027E>an<U+02C8>sil<U+02C8>va<U+02C8>nja|pron}}) and historically as ''Erdel''; see also [[List of European regions with alternative names#T|other denominations]].

* Transylvania was first referred to in a [[Medieval Latin]] document in 1075 as ''ultra silvam'', meaning "beyond the forest" (''ultra'' (+accusative) meaning "beyond" or "on the far side of" and the [[accusative case]] of ''sylva'' (sylvam) meaning "wood or forest"). Transylvania, with an alternative Latin prepositional prefix, means "on the other side of the woods". Hungarian historians claim that the Medieval Latin form ''Ultrasylvania'', later ''Transylvania'', was a direct translation from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] form ''Erd<U+0151>-elve'' (rather than the Hungarian being derived from the Latin).<ref name=engel>Engel, P<U+00E1>l (2001).

* The [[German language|German]] name ''Siebenb<U+00FC>rgen'' means "seven fortresses", after the seven ([[ethnic German]]) [[Transylvanian Saxons]]' cities in the region. This is also the origin of the region's name in many other languages, such as the [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Siedmiogr<U+00F3>d'' and the Ukrainian <U+0421><U+0435><U+043C><U+0438><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434> (''Semyhorod'').
* The Hungarian form ''Erd<U+00E9>ly'' was first mentioned in the 12th-century ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' as "Erdeuleu". ''Erdel'', the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] equivalent originates from this form, too.
* The first known written occurrence of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name ''Ardeal'' appeared in a document in 1432 as ''Ardeliu''.<ref name=Ardeliu>{{Cite journal | last= Pascu | first= <U+015E>tefan | title= Voievodatul Transilvaniei | volume= I | year= 1972 | page= 22 | postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>

===Brief survey===
Transylvania has been dominated by several different peoples and countries throughout its history. It was once the nucleus of the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] (82 BC<U+2013>106 AD). In 106 AD the [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Roman Dacia|the territory]], systematically exploiting its resources. After the Roman legions withdrew in 271 AD, it was overrun by a succession of various tribes, bringing it under the control of the [[Carpi (Dacian tribe)]], [[Visigoths]], [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. It is a subject of dispute whether elements of the mixed Daco<U+2013>Roman population survived in Transylvania through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (becoming the ancestors of modern [[Romanians]]) or the first [[Vlachs]]/Romanians appeared in the area in the 13th century after a northward migration from the [[Balkan Peninsula]].<ref>Istv<U+00E1>n L<U+00E1>z<U+00E1>r: ''Transylvania, a Short History, Simon Publications'', Safety Harbor, Florida, 1996

The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] conquered much of Central Europe at the end of the 9th century. According to [[Gesta Hungarorum]], Transylvania was ruled by Vlach voivode [[Gelou]] after the Hungarians arrived.

However, ethnic groups that lived in this principality also included numerous [[Romanians]] and [[Germans]].

In its ancient history, the territory of Transylvania belonged to a variety of empires and states, including the [[Celts in Transylvania|Celts]], [[Scythians]], the [[Kingdom of Dacia]] and the [[Roman Empire]].

[[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] existed at least as early as the 2nd century [[Before Christ|BC]] when, [[Rubobostes]], a Dacian king from the territory of present-day Transylvania, undertook control of the [[Carpathian basin]] by defeating the [[Celts]] who previously held power in the region.

Dacia reached its maximum extent under the rule of [[Burebista]]. The area now constituting Transylvania was the political center of the ancient Kingdom of Dacia, where several important fortified cities were built; among them was the capital [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa|Sarmizegetusa]], located near the current Romanian town of [[Hunedoara]].

[[File:Porta Praetoria at castra Porolissum, Romania - view from inside.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Porta Praetoria at [[Porolissum]], [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]] (modern Transylvania, Romania)]]
In 101-102 and 105-106 AD, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] armies under the Emperor [[Trajan]] fought a series of [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|military campaigns]] to subjugate the wealthy Dacian Kingdom. By 106, under Trajan they succeeded in subduing the southern and central regions of Dacia. After the conquest, the Romans seized an enormous amount of wealth (the Dacian Wars were commemorated on [[Trajan's Column]] in [[Rome]]) and immediately started to exploit the [[Alburnus Maior|Dacian gold]] and salt mines located in today's territory of Transylvania. Roman influence was broadened by the construction of modern roads and some existing major cities such as [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]] and [[Dierna]] (today [[Or<U+015F>ova]]) became [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonies]]. The new province was divided under [[Hadrian]]: ''Dacia Superior'', corresponding roughly to Transylvania and ''Dacia Inferior'', similar to the region of South Romania ([[Walachia]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2008}} During [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161) the same territory was included in the provinces ''Dacia Porolissensis'' (capital at [[Porolissum]]) and ''Dacia Apulensis'' (capital at [[Alba Iulia#Ancient times|Apulum]], today [[Alba-Iulia]] city in Romania). The Romans built new mines, roads and forts in the [[Roman Dacia|province]]. Colonists from other Roman provinces were brought in to settle the land, founding the cities of ''Apulum'' (now [[Alba Iulia]]), ''Napoca'' (now [[Cluj-Napoca]]), [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]] and [[Aquae]]. During the Roman administration, Christianity entered into the current territory of Transylvania from neighboring Roman provinces where, according to the tradition of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], [[St. Andrew]] preached.

===Migration period===
{{Main|Transylvania in the Early Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Dacia Aureliana|Origin of the Romanians|Romania in the Early Middle Ages|Migration Period}}
[[File:DonariumBiertan.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The [[Biertan Donarium]] - an early Christian votive object of the early 4th century. The inscription in [[Latin]] reads "''EGO ZENOVIUS VOTUM POSVI''" with approximate translation "I, Zenovius, offered this gift"]]
Due to increasing pressure from the Visigoths,<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition</ref> the Romans abandoned the province during the reign of the Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 271. Its subsequent history is controversial. The theory of Daco-Romanian continuity asserts that as across much of Europe, a period of chaos and conquests followed after the collapse of Roman rule. Archeological research shows however that many of the Roman cities continued to exist with additional fortifications. It is also asserted that Christianity survived,  based on the large number of artifacts discovered. The theory refers with emphasis to a [[donarium from Biertan]] (4th century) having the inscription "''Ego Zenovius votvm posui''" (I, Zenovie, offered this). The Migration theory denies that any significant Romanized population continued to exist in the former province after its occupation by the Visigoths. It is asserted that the rare and isolated Latin inscriptions may be attributed to slaves captured by the Goths in the territory of the Roman Empire and even these disappear within a few decades. The Goths themselves were Christians, so Christian artifacts do not prove the continuity of a Romanized population.

[[File:00Germanic Fibulae MNIR TezaurIMG 6156.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Gepid]] artifact from the  [[Apahida necropolis|Apahida royal tomb]]]]
The territory fell under the control of the Visigoths and [[Carpians]] until they were, in their turn, displaced and subdued by the [[Huns]] after 376. After the disintegration of [[Attila the Hun|Attila]]'s empire, the Huns were succeeded by the [[Gepid]]s, who were defeated by the [[Eurasian Avar]]s who ruled the region until around 800 AD. During the Avar rule, after the 6th century, the region was influenced by massive [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] immigration.

It is subject of controversy whether elements of the mixed Daco<U+2013>Roman population survived in Transylvania through the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (becoming the ancestors of modern [[Romanians]]) or the first [[Vlachs]] appeared in the area in the 13th century after a northward migration from the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} There is an ongoing scholarly debate over the ethnicity of Transylvania's population before the Hungarian conquest (see [[Origin of the Romanians]]).

At the beginning of the 9th century, Transylvania, along with eastern [[Pannonia]], was under the control of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} After a brief period of Bulgarian rule, the territory was partially under Byzantine control.

There were also periods when autonomous political entities arose under the control of the Byzantine and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/49.html |title=6.

After the occupation, the Hungarian crown encouraged immigration in order to counter invasion. Most important was the settlement of the [[Sz<U+00E9>kely]]s and the [[Germans]], who came in the 12th century. As a political entity, (Southern) Transylvania is mentioned from the 12th century as a [[county]] (Alba) of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (''M. princeps ultrasilvanus - comes Bellegratae'').

Between 1003 and 1526, Transylvania was a [[voivodeship]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], led by a voivode appointed by the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian King]]. Several raids of Pechenegs, Cumans and Tatars were recorded during the 11th to 13th centuries.

For most of this period, Transylvania, maintaining its internal autonomy, was under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].
 
The early 11th century was marked by the conflict between [[List of Hungarian rulers|King]] [[Stephen I of Hungary]] and his uncle [[Gyula III|Gyula]], the ruler of Transylvania and by battles against Pechenegs. The Hungarian ruler was successful in these wars, and Transylvania was gradually incorporated into the Christian Kingdom of Hungary. The Transylvanian [[Christian]] [[diocese|bishopric]] and the [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus system]] were organised. By the early 11th century, the ethnic [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} [[History of the Sz<U+00E9>kely people|Sz<U+00E9>kely]] were established in southeastern Transylvania<ref name=Columbia/> as a border population of ready warriors, and in the 12th and 13th centuries, the areas in the south and northeast were settled by [[Germans|German]] colonists called [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]].<ref name=Columbia/> Romanians maintained control over a few autonomous regions called 'terrae': F<U+0103>g<U+0103>ra<U+0219>, Alma<U+0219>, Ha<U+021B>eg, Maramure<U+0219>, L<U+0103>pu<U+0219>. However, the autonomy was taken by the end of [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d dynasty]] in 1301.

In 1241<U+2013>1242, during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], Transylvania was among the territories devastated by the Golden Horde. A large portion of the population perished. This was followed by a second Mongol invasion in 1285, led by [[Nogai Khan]]. To escape these depredations, [[Wallachia]]n (Romanian) settlers moved into the mountainous districts of the Carpathians.<ref name=boundary/> The rulers of the Kingdom of Hungary established programs of colonization in eastern and southern Hungary. [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon Germans]], [[Sz<U+00E9>kely]]s, [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], and Wallachians settled in the peripheral areas which had suffered so greatly from the Mongol invasion.<ref name=boundary/>

[[File:Transylvania13cent diocesan div.PNG|left|thumb|Diocesan division of Transylvania in the 13th century within the Kingdom of Hungary]]

Following this devastation, Transylvania was reorganized according to a [[Social class|class]] system of [[Estate of the realm|Estates]], which established privileged groups (''universitates'') with power and influence in economic and political life, as well as along ethnic lines. The first Estate was the lay and ecclesiastic aristocracy, ethnically heterogeneous, but undergoing a process of homogenization around its Hungarian nucleus. The other Estates were Saxons, Sz<U+00E9>kelys and Romanians (or [[Vlachs]] - ''[[Universitas Valachorum]]''), all with an ethnic and ethno-linguistic basis (''Universis nobilibus, Saxonibus, Syculis et Olachis''). The general assembly (''congregatio generalis'') of the four Estates had few genuine legislative powers in Transylvania, but it sometimes took measures regarding order in the country.

His fame was built in the effective wars of defence against the Turkish attacks, waged from 1439. With his private mercenary army, John rapidly rose to the heights of power. His military campaigns against the [[Ottoman Empire]] brought him the status of Transylvanian [[governor]] in 1446 and [[Pope|papal]] recognition as the [[List of Transylvanian rulers|Prince]] of Transylvania in 1448. Continuing his military activity, he won an important victory at Belgrade in 1456, which halted the Ottomans' advance for several decades, but died shortly afterwards during an epidemic.

After the suppression of the [[Bob<U+00E2>lna revolt|Budai Nagy Antal]]-revolt in 1437, the political system was based on ''[[Unio Trium Nationum]]'' (''The Union of the Three Nations''). According to the Union, which was explicitly directed against [[Serfdom|serfs]] and other peasants, society was ruled by three [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]d [[Estate of the realm|Estates]] of the [[Nobility and Royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|nobility]] (mostly ethnic Hungarians), the [[Sz<U+00E9>kely]]s, also an ethnic Hungarian people who primarily served as warriors, and the ethnic German, Saxon [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]].

The only possibility for Romanians to retain or access nobility in Hungarian Transylvania was through [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]. Some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Romanian nobles converted, becoming integrated into the Hungarian nobility. These circumstances marked the beginning of a conflict between ethnic Hungarian Catholics and ethnic Romanian Orthodox (and ethnic [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek Catholic|Romanian Greek Catholics]] also) in the territory of Transylvania which in some regions remains unresolved to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/62/456.html |title=Romania Confronts Transylvanian Separatism |publisher=Hartford-hwp.com |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>

[[File:1606 map Ward 1912.jpg|thumb|Principality of Transylvania]]
Transylvania became an Ottoman vassal state, where native princes, who paid the Turks tribute, ruled with considerable autonomy.<ref name="Partition of Hungary"/> [[Habsburg Empire|Austrian]] and Turkish influences vied for supremacy for nearly two centuries. It is this period of independence and Turkish influence that contributed to Transylvania being seen as [[orientalism|exotic]] in the eyes of [[Victorian era|Victorians]] such as [[Bram Stoker]], whose novel ''[[Dracula]]'' was published in 1897.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/uni/nec/coundour92.htm |title=Eleni Coundouriotis, Dracula and the Idea of Europe |publisher=Uni-tuebingen.de |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>

Because Transylvania was now beyond the reach of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] religious authority, [[Protestant]] preaching such as [[Lutheran]]ism and [[Calvinist|Calvinism]] were able to flourish in the region. In 1568, the [[Edict of Turda]] proclaimed four religious expressions in Transylvania - [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Rite or Eastern Rite Catholicism]], [[Lutheran]]ism, [[Calvinism]] and [[Unitarianism]] ([[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]]), while [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]], which was the confession of almost the entire ethnic Romanian part of the population, was proclaimed as "tolerated" (''tolerata'').

The [[B<U+00E1>thory]], a Hungarian noble family, began to rule Transylvania as princes under the Ottomans in 1571, and briefly under [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] suzerainty until 1600. The latter period of their rule saw a four-sided conflict in Transylvania involving the Transylvanian B<U+00E1>thorys, the emerging [[Austrian Empire]], the Ottoman Empire, and the neighboring Romanian voivoideship (province) of [[Wallachia]]. This included almost a year period of Romanian rule after the conquest of the territory by [[Wallachia]]n voivod Michael the Brave. As he subsequently extended his rule over [[Moldavia]], Michael the Brave unified all the territories where Romanians lived, rebuilding the mainland of the ancient Kingdom of [[Dacia]].<ref>Rezachevici, Constantin, Mihai Viteazul et la "Dacie" de Sigismund B<U+00E1>thory en 1595, Ed.

The prince, who managed for a short time in 1600 to rule the three territories that were to be united some three centuries later in modern Romania, begins to be perceived as a unifier only towards the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=18|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/18/}}</ref> Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800.

[[File:4k ref portre bocskai.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Stephen Bocskay]], Prince of Transylvania]]
The [[Calvinist]] magnate of [[Bihar (Hungary)|Bihar county]] [[Stephen Bocskai]] managed to obtain, through the [[Treaty of Vienna (1606)|Treaty of Vienna]] (June 23, 1606), religious liberty and political autonomy for the region, the restoration of all confiscated estates, the repeal of all "unrighteous" judgments, as well as his own recognition as independent sovereign prince of an enlarged Transylvania. Under Bocskai's successors, most notably [[Gabriel Bethlen]] and [[George I R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi]], Transylvania passed through a [[golden age]] for many religious movements and for the arts and culture. It became one of the few European States where [[Roman Catholic]]s, [[Calvinist]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] lived in peace, although [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Romanians]] continued to be denied equal recognition.

This golden age and relative independence of Transylvania ended with the reign of [[George II R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi]]. The prince, coveting the Polish crown, allied with Sweden and invaded Poland in spite of the Turkish [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] clearly prohibiting any military action. R<U+00E1>k<U+00F3>czi's defeat in Poland, combined with the subsequent invasions of Transylvania by the Turks and their Crimean Tatar allies in 1660, the ensuing loss of territory (most importantly, the loss of the most important Transylvanian stronghold, [[Oradea]]) and diminishing manpower led to the complete subordination of Transylvania, which became a powerless vassal of the Ottoman Empire.

After the defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the Habsburgs gradually began to impose their rule on the formerly autonomous Transylvania. Apart from strengthening the central government and administration, the Habsburgs also promoted the Roman Catholic Church, both as a uniting force and also as an instrument to reduce the influence of the Protestant nobility.<ref name=Stoica2>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=22|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/22/}}</ref> In addition, they tried to persuade Romanian Orthodox clergymen to join the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek (Byzantine Rite) Catholic Church in union with Rome]].

The [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|revolutionary year 1848]] was marked by a great struggle between the Hungarians, the Romanians and the Habsburg Empire.

Having quashed the revolution, Austria imposed a repressive regime on Hungary, ruled Transylvania directly through a military governor <!-- ? and many medieval privileges ?-->and granted citizenship to the Romanians.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The 300-year long special separate status was terminated by the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], which established the [[dual monarchy]] and reincorporated Transylvania into Hungary. On 20 June 1867, the [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] was dissolved by royal decree, and an ordinance abrogated the legislative acts of the [[Cluj-Napoca]] provincial assembly. The department of the interior inherited the responsibilities of the [[Transylvanian Gubernium]], and the government reserved the right to name Transylvania's royal magistrates as well as the Saxon bailiff of the Universitas Saxorum.

Its Magyar-led anti-Habsburg struggles preceded the popular nationalism that emerged among the Pannonian Magyars in the early 19th century. Even after the revolution of 1848 and the 1867 Ausgleich separating Austria from Hungary, Transylvanian aristocrats continued to exert a high degree of power since Hungary adopted what some historians call an official nationalism.<ref>Brett Neilson, ''Free trade in the Bermuda Triangle and other tales of counterglobalization'', 2003, p.63</ref>
[[File:Memorandum-Transylvania.jpg|thumb|250px|The signers of the Transylvanian Memorandum]]
Although Romanians formed the majority of Transylvania's population (59%), they had not been awarded legal status as a nation. In 1892 the leaders of the Romanians of Transylvania sent a [[Transylvanian Memorandum|Memorandum]] to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor-King [[Franz Joseph]], asking for equal ethnic rights with the Hungarians, and demanding an end to persecutions and Magyarization attempts. Franz Josef forwarded the memorandum to Budapest, and the authors were tried for treason in May 1894, being sentenced to long prison terms.

===Union with Romania===
[[File:AsambleaDeAlbaIulia19181201.jpg|left|thumb|The National Assembly in [[Alba Iulia]] (December 1, 1918)]]

Following defeat in World War I, Austria-Hungary began to disintegrate. The [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] majority elected representatives, who then proclaimed [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Union]] with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] on December 1, 1918. The ''Proclamation of Union'' of Alba Iulia was adopted by the Deputies of the Romanians from Transylvania, and supported one month later by the vote of the Deputies of the Saxons from Transylvania. In 1920, the Allies confirmed the union in the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Hungary protested as over 1,600,000 Hungarian people<ref name="T<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>nelmi vil<U+00E1>gatlasz"/> were living in the area in question, mainly in [[Sz<U+00E9>kely Land]] (Romanian: Secuime) of Eastern Transylvania, and along the newly created border, which was partially drawn through areas with compact Hungarian population. In August 1940, in the midst of World War II, Hungary regained about 40% of Transylvania by the [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna Award]], with the aid of Germany and Italy. The territory, however, was returned to Romania in 1945; this was confirmed in the 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties]].<ref name="Britannica"/>

As [[Austria-Hungary]] disintegrated at the end of World War I, the nationalities living there proclaimed their independence from the empire. The 1228-member National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary, headed by leaders of Transylvania's [[Romanian National Party]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat|Social Democratic Party]], passed a resolution calling for unification of all Romanians in a single state on 1 December in [[Alba Iulia]].<ref name=nationalday>{{cite web | title= December 1 - Romania National Day | publisher= Honorary Consul of Romania in Boston | url= http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/History/December1.html | accessdate= 2008-01-12}}</ref> This was approved by the National Council of the Germans from Transylvania and the Council of the [[Danube Swabians]] from the [[Banat]], on 15 December in [[Media<U+0219>]]. In response, the Hungarian General Assembly of [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]] reaffirmed the loyalty of Hungarians from Transylvania to Hungary on December 22, 1918. (''See also: [[Union of Transylvania with Romania]]'')
The [[Treaty of Versailles]] placed Transylvania under the sovereignty of Romania, an ally of the [[Triple Entente]], and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] (1919) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (signed in June 1920) further elaborated the status of Transylvania and defined the new border between the states of Hungary and Romania.<ref name=treaties>{{cite web | last= Bachman | first= Robert D. | title= Romania: A Country Study | year= 1989 | url= http://countrystudies.us/romania/20.htm | accessdate= 2008-01-12}}</ref><ref name=Trianon>{{cite web | title= Trianon, Treaty of | publisher= [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] | url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073332/Treaty-of-Trianon | accessdate= 2008-01-12}}</ref> King [[Ferdinand I of Romania]] and Queen [[Marie of Edinburgh|Maria of Romania]] were crowned at Alba Iulia in 1922 as King and Queen of all Romania.

===World War II and Communist Romania===
In August 1940, the second [[Vienna Awards|Vienna Award]] granted [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. After the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] (1947) following World War II, the territory was returned to Romania. The post-World War II borders with Hungary, agreed on at the Treaty of Paris, were identical with those set out in 1920.

After World War II and especially after the fall of Communism in Romania almost all of the German-speaking population left Transylvania, most of them settling in Germany.

In 1996 Romania and Hungary signed a Basic Treaty on Understanding, Cooperation, and Good-Neighborliness, aiming to protect and develop the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Hungarian minority in Romania and the Romanian minority in Hungary<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty between the Republic of Hungary and Romania on Understanding, Cooperation and Good Neighbourhood|url=http://hungaryemb.ines.ro/en/tratat.html}}</ref> receiving good feedback from US and EU members in the context of NATO enlargement.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Department Of State, Press Statement:Romania and Hungary Sign Treaty|url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/briefing/press_statements/9609/960916ps1.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=UK House Of Commons praises the Treaty between Romania and Hungary|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo961101/text/61101w13.htm}}</ref>

The Transylvanian plateau, 300 to 500 metres (1,000-1,600 feet) high, is drained by the [[Mure<U+0219> River|Mure<U+0219>]], [[Some<U+0219> River|Some<U+0219>]], [[Cri<U+0219> River|Cri<U+0219>]], and [[Olt River|Olt]] rivers, as well as other tributaries of the [[Danube]]. This core of historical Transylvania roughly corresponds with nine counties of modern Romania. Other areas to the west and north, which also united with Romania in 1918 (inside the border established by peace treaties in 1919-20), are since that time widely considered part of Transylvania.

Official censuses with information on Transylvania's population have been conducted since the 18th century. On May 1, 1784 the Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] called for the first official census of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], including Transylvania. The data was published in 1787, and this census showed only the overall population (1,440,986 inhabitants).<ref>http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/transy/transy03.htm</ref> [[:hu:F<U+00E9>nyes Elek|F<U+00E9>nyes Elek]], a 19th-century Hungarian statistician, estimated in 1842 that in the population of Transylvania for the years 1830-1840 the majority were 62.3% [[Romanians]] and 23.3% [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]].<ref>Elek F<U+00E9>nyes, ''Magyarorsz<U+00E1>g statistik<U+00E1>ja'', Vol. 1, Trattner-K<U+00E1>rolyi, Pest. VII, 1842</ref>

The first official census in Transylvania that made a distinction between nationalities (distinction made on the basis of mother tongue) was performed by [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities in 1869, distributed among the ethnic groups as follows: Romanians 59.0%, Hungarians 24.9%, [[Germans]] 11.9%.

In the last quarter of the 19th century, the Hungarian population of Transylvania increased from 24.9% in 1869 to 31.6%, as indicated in the 1910 Hungarian census. At the same time, the percentage of Romanian population decreased from 59.0% to 53.8% and the percentage of German population decreased from 11.9% to 10.7%, for a total population of 5,262,495. [[Magyarization]] policies greatly contributed to this shift.<ref name="'ia'">{{cite journal|title=The Problem of Treaty Revision and the Hungarian Frontiers|journal=International Affairs|year=1933|first=Robert William|last=Seton-Watson|volume=12|issue=4|pages=481<U+2013>503 |url=}}</ref>

The percentage of Romanian majority has significantly increased since the union of Transylvania with Romania after World War I in 1918. The proportion of Hungarians in Transylvania was in steep decline as more of the region's inhabitants moved into urban areas, where the pressure to assimilate and Romanianize was greater.<ref>Varga, E. <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d, [http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erdang.htm ''Hungarians in Transylvania between 1870 and 1995''], Translation by Tam<U+00E1>s S<U+00E1>lyi, Budapest, March 1999, pp. 30-34</ref> The expropriation of the estates of Magyar [[magnate]]s, the distribution of the lands to the Romanian peasants, and the policy of cultural [[Romanianization]] that followed the [[Treaty of Trianon]] were major causes of friction between Hungary and Romania.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Transylvania|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/tr/Transylv.html|encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref> Other factors include the emigration of non-Romanian peoples, assimilation and internal migration within Romania (estimates show that between 1945 and 1977, some 630,000 people moved from the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]] to Transylvania, and 280,000 from Transylvania to the Old Kingdom, most notably to [[Bucharest]]).<ref>Varga, E. <U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d, [http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erdang.htm ''Hungarians in Transylvania between 1870 and 1995''], Translation by Tam<U+00E1>s S<U+00E1>lyi, Budapest, March 1999, p. 31</ref>

===Current population===
The [[Demographic history of Romania#18 March 2002 census|2002 census]] classified Transylvania as the entire region of Romania west of the [[Carpathians]]. This region has a population of 7,221,733, with a large [[Romanians|Romanian]] majority (75.9%). There are also sizeable [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian]] (19.6%), [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (3.3%), [[Transylvanian Saxons|German]] (0.7%) and [[Serbs of Romania|Serb]] (0.1%) communities.<ref>[http://www.recensamant.ro/ 2002 Census official results]</ref><ref>[http://www.edrc.ro/recensamant.jsp?language=0 ''Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Centre'' database]</ref> The ethnic Hungarian population of Transylvania, largely composed of [[Sz<U+00E9>kely]], form a majority in the counties of [[Covasna County|Covasna]] and [[Harghita County|Harghita]].

==Economy==
Transylvania is rich in mineral resources, notably [[lignite]], [[iron]], [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[gold]], [[copper]], [[natural gas]], [[salt]] and [[sulfur]].

There are large iron and [[steel]], chemical, and [[textile]] industries. Stock raising, [[agriculture]], [[wine]] production and fruit growing are important occupations. [[Timber]] is another valuable resource.

[[Information technology|IT]], [[electronics]] and [[Automotive industry|automotive]] industries are important in urban and university centers like [[Cluj-Napoca]] ([[Nokia]]), [[Timi<U+0219>oara]] ([[Alcatel-Lucent]], [[Flextronics]] and [[Continental AG]]), [[Bra<U+0219>ov]], [[Sibiu]], [[Oradea]] and [[Arad, Romania|Arad]].

Native brands include: [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]] of [[Bra<U+0219>ov]] (trucks and buses), [[Azomure<U+0219>]] of [[T<U+00E2>rgu Mure<U+0219>]] (fertilizers), [[Terapia Ranbaxy|Terapia]] of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (pharmaceuticals), [[Banca Transilvania]] of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (finance), [[Romgaz]] and [[Transgaz]] of [[Media<U+0219>]] (natural gas), [[Jidvei wines|Jidvei]] of [[Alba county]] (alcoholic beverages), [[Timi<U+015F>oreana]] of [[Timi<U+0219>oara]] (alcoholic beverages) and others.

Transylvania accounts for around 35% of Romania's GDP, and has a GDP per capita (PPP) of around $11,500, around 10% higher than the Romanian average.

==Historical coat of arms of Transylvania==
{{Main|Coat of arms of Transylvania}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Transylvania.svg|thumb|150px|The historical arms of Transylvania (1659).]]
The first heraldic representations of Transylvania date from the 16th century. One of the predominant early symbols of Transylvania was the coat of arms of [[Sibiu]] city. In 1596 [[Levinus Hulsius]] created a coat of arms for the imperial province of Transylvania, consisting of a shield [[Division of the field|party per fess]], with a rising eagle in the upper field and seven hills with towers on top in the lower field. He published it in his work "Chronologia", issued in [[Nuremberg]] the same year. The seal from 1597 of [[Sigismund B<U+00E1>thory]], prince of Transylvania, reproduced the new coat of arms with some slight changes: in the upper field the eagle was flanked by a sun and a moon and in the lower field the hills were replaced by simple towers.<ref>Dan Cernovodeanu, ''<U+015E>tiin<U+0163>a <U+015F>i arta heraldic<U+0103> <U+00EE>n Rom<U+00E2>nia'', Bucharest, 1977, p. 130</ref>

The seal of [[Michael the Brave]] from 1600 depicts the territory of the former [[Dacia|Dacian kingdom]]: [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and Transylvania:<ref name="Coat of arms of Dacia medieval">{{cite web|title=Coat of arms of Dacia (medieval)|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html}}</ref>
* The black eagle ([[Wallachia]])
* The [[auroch]] head ([[Moldavia]])
* The seven hills (Transylvania).
* Over the hills there were two rampant lions affronts, supporting the trunk of a tree, as a symbol of the reunited [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]].<ref name="Coat of arms of Dacia medieval"/>

The [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the representation of the privileged nations in Transylvania's [[coat of arms]]. It depicted a black [[turul]] on a blue background, representing the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility,<ref>{{cite book |title=Oesterreichish-Ungarische Wappenrolle |last=Str<U+00F6>hl |first=Hugo Gerard |authorlink=Hugo Gerard Str<U+00F6>hl |year=1890 |publisher=Verlag vom Anton Schroll & C<U+00B0> |location=Vienna |page= XV. |url=http://www.austria-lexikon.at/attach/Wissenssammlungen/Symbole/Wappenrolle_Str%C3%B6hl_1890/Wappenrolle_1890_Text.pdf |accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref> a [[Sun]] and the [[crescent|Moon]] representing the [[Sz<U+00E9>kely]]s, and seven red towers on a yellow background representing the [[Transylvanian Saxons#Fortification of the towns|seven fortified cities]] of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. The red dividing band was originally not part of the coat of arms.

Currently, unlike the counties included in it, the region of Transylvania does not have its own official coat of arms. Nonetheless, the historical coat of arms is currently present in the [[coat of arms of Romania]], alongside the traditional coats of arms of the rest of Romania's historical regions.

[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|left|thumb|115px|[[Bela Lugosi|Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]]]]
Following the publication of [[Emily Gerard]]'s ''The Land Beyond the Forest'' (1888), [[Bram Stoker]] wrote his [[Gothic fiction|gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' in 1897, using Transylvania as a setting. With its success, Transylvania became associated in the English-speaking world with [[vampire]]s. Since then it has been represented in fiction and literature as a land of mystery and magic. For example, in [[Paulo Coelho]]'s novel ''[[The Witch of Portobello]]'', the main character, Sherine Khalil, is described as a Transylvanian orphan with a [[Romani people|Romani]] mother, in an effort to add to the character's exotic mystique.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The so-called Transylvanian trilogy of historical novels by [[Miklos Banffy]], ''The Writing on the Wall'', is an extended treatment of the 19th- and early 20th-century social and political history of the country.  Among the first actors to portray [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]  [[Dracula (1931 film)|in film]] was [[Bela Lugosi]], who was born in Banat, in present-day Romania.
