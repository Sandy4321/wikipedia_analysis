'''Johnston's Jolly Cemetery''' is a [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] [[cemetery]] containing the remains of some of the Allied troops who died during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]].

The [[Battle of Gallipoli|battles at Gallipoli]] were an eight month campaign fought by [[British Empire]] and [[France|French]] forces against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in an attempt to force [[Turkey]] out of the war and to open a supply route to [[Russia]] through the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Black Sea]].  

Johnston's Jolly was a position covering the North end of Plateau 400 in the ANZAC sector which was captured by the 2nd Australian Infantry Brigade on [[25 April]] [[1915]], the day of the landing, but recaptured by Turkish forces the following day and remained under Turkish control for the rest of the campaign.

Turkish name for the position was ''Kirmezi Sirt'', Red Ridge, whilst the ANZAC troops called it Johnston's Jolly, because it was opposite [[George Johnston (general)|Colonel George Johnston]]'s field artillery position which would be used to "jolly up" the defending Turks.<ref>{{cite book | Author = [[Charles Bean]] | volume = I - The Story of ANZAC from the outbreak of war to the end of the first phase of the Gallipoli Campaign, May 4, 1915 | page = 339 | chapter = 16 | title= Official History of Australia in the War of 1914 | edition = 11 | year = 1941 | url = | accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref>

The cemetery was constructed after the Armistice and populated with remains found on the surrounding battlefield. There is only one identified individual, although the nationalities of a few other graves are known and special memorials record the names of 36 Australian soldiers known to be buried in the cemetery.
