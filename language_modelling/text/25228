The history of  '''draining and development of the Everglades''' goes back to the 19th century, before [[Florida]] became a state. During the [[Second Seminole War]] beginning in 1836, the United States military's mission was to seek out people of the [[Seminole]] tribe in the [[Everglades]] and capture or kill them. Those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn. A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use. According to historians, "From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned. Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do."<ref name="meindl">Meindl, Christopher, et al (December, 2002). "On the Importance of Claims-Making: The Role of James O. Wright in Promoting the Drainage of Florida's Everglades in the Early Twentieth Century", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', '''92''' (4), p.&nbsp;682<U+2013>701.</ref> 

A pattern of political and financial motivation, and a lack of understanding of the [[geography and ecology of the Everglades]] has plagued the history of drainage projects. The Everglades are a part of a massive [[Drainage basin|watershed]] that originates near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] and drains into [[Lake Okeechobee]], a vast and shallow lake. As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season, the water forms a flat and very wide river, approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} long, and {{convert|60|mi|km}} wide. As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to [[Florida Bay]], water flows at a rate of half a mile (0.8&nbsp;km) a day. Before human activity in the Everglades, the system comprised a third of the lower Florida peninsula. The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer [[Hamilton Disston]] in 1881. Disston's sponsored canals were unsuccessful, but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer [[Henry Flagler]]. Flagler built a railroad along the east coast of Florida and eventually to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]]; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line.

During his 1904&nbsp;campaign to be elected [[governor]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] promised to drain the Everglades, and his later projects were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of [[wading birds]] (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals. 

Severe hurricanes in [[1926 Atlantic hurricane season|1926]] and [[1928 Atlantic hurricane season|1928]] caused catastrophic damage and flooding from Lake Okeechobee that prompted the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] to build a [[dike]] around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after [[World War II]], and the creation of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct of a massive jetport next to [[Everglades National Park]], national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.

American involvement in the [[Everglades]] began during the [[Second Seminole War]] (1836<U+2013>42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30&nbsp;million and $40&nbsp;million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000&nbsp;lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged with the task of finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma [[Indian territory]]. Almost 4,000&nbsp;Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;245.</ref><ref name="dovell">Dovell, J. E. (July 1947). "The Everglades Before Reclamation", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''26''' (1), p.&nbsp;1<U+2013>44.</ref> The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on [[Cladium|sawgrass]], ruined their boots on the uneven [[limestone]] floor, and were plagued by [[mosquito]]es. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and [[gangrene]] infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842.<ref name="dovell"/> General [[Thomas Jesup]] admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.<ref name="dovell"/>  

Opinion about the value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for national prosperity.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;31<U+2013>32.</ref> In 1838 comments in ''The Army and Navy Chronicle'' supported future development of southern Florida: <blockquote>[The] climate [is] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [it] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.<ref>White, Frank (October, 1959). "The Journals of Lieutenant John Pickell, 1836<U+2013>1837", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''38''' (2), p.&nbsp;143<U+2013>172.</ref></blockquote>

[[Image:US War Department Everglades Map 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Map of the [[Everglades]] by the U.S. [[War Department]] in 1856: Military action during the [[Seminole Wars]] improved understanding of the features of the Everglades.]]

The military penetration of southern Florida offered the opportunity to map a poorly understood part of the country. As late as 1823, official reports doubted the existence of a large inland lake, until the military met the Seminoles at the [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]] in 1837.<ref>Lodge, p.&nbsp;110</ref> To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel [[William Harney]] led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named [[Chekika]]. With Harney were 90&nbsp;soldiers in 16&nbsp;canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the ''St. Augustine News'' was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: "No country that I have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".<ref>Tebeau, p.&nbsp;66<U+2013>67.</ref>

The final blame for the military stalemate was determined to lay not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: "It is in fact a most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile."<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a "waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen."<ref>Tebeau, p.&nbsp;71.</ref> A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami. The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the [[Shark River (Florida)|Shark River]]: "The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves and we saw him crying, he would not tell us why, he was just plain scared."<ref>Tebeau, p.&nbsp;75<U+2013>76.</ref> 

In 1897, an explorer named Hugh Willoughby spent eight days canoeing with a party from the mouth of the Harney River to the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]]. He wrote about his observations and sent them back to the ''New Orleans Times-Democrat''. Willoughby described the water as healthy and wholesome, with numerous [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and 10,000&nbsp;[[alligator]]s "more or less" in Lake Okeechobee. The party encountered thousands of birds near the Shark River, "killing hundreds, but they continued to return".<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;65<U+2013>69.</ref> Willoughby pointed out that much of the rest of the country had been mapped and explored except for this part of Florida, writing, "(w)e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of Africa."<ref name="stephan">Stephan, L. Lamar (December, 1942). "Geographic Role of the Everglades in the Early History of Florida", ''The Scientific Monthly'', '''55''', (6)  p.&nbsp;515<U+2013>526.</ref>

== Drainage ==

As early as 1837, a visitor to the Everglades suggested the value of the land without the water:<blockquote>Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? Could the waterpower, obtained by draining, be improved to any useful purpose? Would such draining render the country unhealthy?&nbsp;... Many queries like these passed through our minds. They can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole country. Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What facilities for commerce!<ref name="dovell"/></blockquote> 

Territorial representative [[David Levy Yulee|David Levy]] proposed a resolution that was passed in [[U.S. Congress]] in 1842: "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained in relation to the practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida."<ref name="dovell"/> From this directive [[Secretary of Treasury]] [[Robert J. Walker]] requested [[Thomas Buckingham Smith]] from [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three [[canal]]s to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water."<ref name="dovell"/>

Nevertheless, Smith returned a report to the Secretary of the Treasury asking for $500,000 to do the job.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;253.</ref> The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement: <blockquote>The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles. The statesman whose exertions shall cause the millions of acres they contain, now worse than worthless, to teem with the products of agricultural industry; that man who thus adds to the resources of his country&nbsp;... will merit a high place in public favor, not only with his own generation, but with posterity. He will have created a State!<ref name="dovell"/></blockquote> Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades (known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge), connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that {{convert|4|ft|m}} of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for corn, sugar, rice, cotton, and tobacco.<ref name="dovell1948">Dovell, Junius (July 1948). "The Everglades: A Florida Frontier", ''Agricultural History'', '''22''' (3), p.&nbsp;187<U+2013>197.</ref>  

In 1850 Congress passed a law that gave several states [[wetland]]s within their state boundaries. The [[Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act]] ensured that the state would be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands.<ref name="dovell1948"/> Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.

=== Hamilton Disston's canals ===
[[Image:Hamilton Disston Land Sale Notice.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hamilton Disston's land sale notice]]

After the Civil War, a state agency named the Internal Improvement Fund (IIF) was formed in Florida to use grant money to improve Florida through canals, rail lines, and roads. Trustees in the IIF, eager to be rid of the debt incurred by the Civil War, found a [[Pennsylvania]] real estate developer named [[Hamilton Disston]] who was interested in implementing plans to drain the land for agriculture. Disston was persuaded to buy {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of land for $1&nbsp;million in 1881.<ref name="davis">Davis, T. Frederick (January, 1939). "The Disston Land Purchase ", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', '''17''' (3), p.&nbsp;201<U+2013>211.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared it the largest purchase of land ever by any individual.<ref>Barnett, p.&nbsp;17.</ref> Disston began building canals near [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]] to lower the basin of the [[Caloosahatchee River|Caloosahatchee]] and [[Kissimmee River]]s. His workers and engineers faced conditions similar to those of the soldiers during the Seminole Wars; it was harrowing, backbreaking labor in dangerous conditions. The canals seemed at first to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers. Another dredged waterway between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and Lake Okeechobee was built, opening the region to [[steamboat]] traffic.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;92<U+2013>93.</ref> 

Disston's engineers focused on Lake Okeechobee as well. As one colleague put it, "Okeechobee is the point to attack"; the canals were to be "equal or greater than the inflow from the Kissimmee valley, which is the source of all the evil."<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;90.</ref> Disston sponsored the digging of a canal {{convert|11|mi|km}} long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded: "The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief".<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;286.</ref>

Though Disston's canals did not drain, his purchase primed the economy of Florida. It made news and attracted tourists and land buyers alike. Within four years property values doubled, and the population increased significantly.<ref name="davis"/> One newcomer was the inventor [[Thomas Edison]], who bought [[Thomas Edison Winter Estate|a home]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]].<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;284.</ref> Disston opened real estate offices throughout the United States and Europe, and sold tracts of land for $5 an acre, establishing towns on the west coast and in central Florida. English tourists in particular were targeted and responded in large numbers.<ref>Patterson, Gordon (Summer, 1997). "Ditches and Dreams: Nelson Fell and the Rise of Fellsmere", ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'', 76 (1), p.&nbsp;1<U+2013>20.</ref>  Florida passed its first water laws to "build drains, ditches, or water courses upon petition of two or more landowners" in 1893.<ref>Barnett, p.&nbsp;18.</ref>

=== Henry Flagler's railroads ===

Due to Disston's purchase, the IIF was able to sponsor railroad projects, and the opportunity presented itself when oil tycoon [[Henry Flagler]] became enchanted with St. Augustine during a vacation. He built the opulent [[Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n Hotel]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in 1888, and began buying land and building rail lines along the east coast of Florida, first from [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] to [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona]], then as far south as [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] in 1893. Flagler's establishment of "the Styx", a settlement for hotel and rail line workers across the river from the barrier island containing Palm Beach, became [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]].<ref>"Henry Flagler." ''Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement'', Vol. 21. Gale Group, 2001.</ref> Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations and the land bordering the rail lines into citrus farms.<ref>"Henry Morrison Flagler." ''Dictionary of American Biography'' Base Set. American Council of Learned Societies, 1928<U+2013>1936.</ref>

The winter of 1894<U+2013>1895 produced a bitter frost that killed citrus trees as far south as Palm Beach. Miami resident [[Julia Tuttle]] sent Flagler a pristine orange blossom and an invitation to visit Miami, to persuade him to build the railroad farther south. Although he had earlier turned her down several times, Flagler finally agreed, and by 1896 the rail line had been extended to [[Biscayne Bay]].<ref name="bramson">Bramson, Seth (1998). "A Tale of Three Henrys", ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', '''23''', Florida Theme Issue, p.&nbsp;113<U+2013>143.</ref> Three months after the first train arrived, the residents of Miami, 512 in all, voted to incorporate the town. Flagler publicized Miami as a "Magic City" throughout the United States and it became a prime destination for the extremely wealthy after the [[Royal Palm Hotel (Miami)|Royal Palm Hotel]] was opened.<ref>Bush, Gregory (May, 1999).

=== Broward's "Empire of the Everglades" ===

[[Image:Canal in the Everglades Drainage District 1915.jpg|thumb|A canal lock in the Everglades Drainage District around 1915]]

{{see|Geography and ecology of the Everglades}}

Despite the sale of {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, by the turn of the 20th century the IIF was bankrupt due to mismanagement.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;309.</ref> Legal battles ensued between the State of Florida and the railroad owners about who owned the rights to sell reclaimed land in the Everglades. In 1904 [[Governor|gubernatorial]] campaigning, the strongest candidate, [[Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], made draining the Everglades a major plank. He called the future of south Florida the "Empire of the Everglades" and compared its potential to that of [[Holland]] and [[Egypt]]: "It would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the State of Florida to confess that so simple an engineering feat as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power", he wrote to voters.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;312.</ref> Soon after his election, he fulfilled his promise to "drain that abominable pestilence-ridden swamp"<ref>Carter, p.&nbsp;78.</ref> and pushed the Florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands. They began by taxing counties that would be affected by the drainage attempts, at 5 cents an acre, and formed the Everglades Drainage District in 1907.<ref name="dovell"/> 

Broward asked James O. Wright&mdash;an engineer on loan to the State of Florida from the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|USDA]]'s Bureau of Drainage Investigations&mdash;to draw up plans for drainage in 1906. Two dredges were built by 1908, but had cut only {{convert|6|mi|km}} of canals. The project quickly ran out of money, so Broward sold real estate developer [[Richard J. Bolles]] a million dollars worth of land in the Everglades, half a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), before the engineer's report had been submitted.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;93<U+2013>94.</ref> Abstracts from Wright's report were given to the IIF stating that eight canals would be enough to drain {{convert|1850000|acre|km2}} at a cost of a dollar an acre.<ref name="McCally96">McCally, p.&nbsp;96.</ref> The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements, and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible.<ref name="McCally96" /> Wright's supervisor noted errors in the report, as well as undue enthusiasm for draining, and delayed its release in 1910. Different unofficial versions of the report circulated<U+2014>some that had been altered by real estate interests<U+2014>and a version hastily put together by Senator [[Duncan U. Fletcher]] called ''U.S. Senate Document 89'' included early unrevised statements, causing a frenzy of speculation.<ref name="meindl"/> 

[[Image:Blueprint for Everglades canals1921.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Blueprint for drainage canals in the Everglades in 1921]]

Wright's initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult. Building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a [[dike]] around [[Lake Okeechobee]]. The soil would be fertile after drainage, the climate would not be adversely affected, and the enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in the dry season.<ref name="meindl"/> Wright based his conclusions on 15&nbsp;years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the 1890s. His calculations concentrated on the towns of [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] and [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. Since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the Everglades, none was included in the report. Furthermore, the heaviest year of rain on record, Wright assumed, was atypical, and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense.  Wright's calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55&nbsp;percent.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;101.</ref> His most fundamental mistake, however, was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of {{convert|4|in|cm}} of water a day, based on flawed data for July and August rainfall, despite available data that indicated torrential downpours of {{convert|10|in|cm}} and {{convert|12|in|cm}} had occurred in 24-hour periods.<ref name="meindl"/> 

Though a few voices expressed skepticism of the report's conclusions&mdash;notably [[Frank Stoneman]], the editor of the ''Miami News-Record'' (the forerunner of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'')&mdash;the report was hailed as impeccable, coming from a branch of the U.S. government.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> In 1912 Florida appointed Wright to oversee the drainage, and the real estate industry energetically misrepresented this mid-level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage, in charge of the [[U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]].<ref name="meindl"/> However, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] investigated Wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it. Wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report's publication. One testified at the hearings: "I regard Mr. Wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work".<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;101<U+2013>12.</ref>

Governor Broward ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, [[William Sherman Jennings|William Jennings]], were paid by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. He was elected to the Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] paid him tribute by naming [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;148<U+2013>149.</ref> Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the [[Panama Canal]] inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to [[Key West]] in 1912.<ref name="bramson"/>

== Boom and plume harvesting ==

[[Image:Everglades real estate tour buses.jpg|thumb|A group of tour buses leads prospective buyers to newly drained lots in [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] in 1921]]

Real estate companies continued to advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912<U+2014>the end of the dry season<U+2014>reporters from all over the U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;153.</ref> Land developers sold 20,000&nbsp;lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for [[mail fraud]] when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;107<U+2013>108.</ref> Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;124<U+2013>126.</ref> Settlers encountered rodents, [[skink]]s, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;318.</ref> It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked [[copper]] and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft.&nbsp;Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;325.</ref>  

With the increasing population in towns near the Everglades came hunting opportunities. Even decades earlier, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] had been horrified at the hunting by visitors, and she wrote the first conservation publication for Florida in 1877: "[t]he decks of boats are crowded with men, whose only feeling amid our magnificent forests, seems to be a wild desire to shoot something and who fire at every living thing on shore."<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;119<U+2013>120.</ref> Otters and raccoons were the most widely hunted for their skins. Otter pelts could fetch between $8 to $15 each. Raccoons, more plentiful, only warranted 75 cents each in 1915. Hunting often went unchecked; on one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250&nbsp;alligators and 172&nbsp;otters.<ref name="McCally117">McCally, p. 117.</ref>

[[Image:Magazine cutout ladies plume hats.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 1904 magazine cutout showing the plumes for women's hats that were harvested from wading birds in the Everglades]]
[[Wader|Wading birds]] were a particular target. Their feathers were used in women's hats from the late 19th century until the 1920s. In 1886, five million birds were estimated to have been killed for their feathers.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;120.</ref> They were usually shot in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. [[Aigrette]]s, as the plumes were called in the [[millinery]] business, sold in 1915 for $32 an ounce, also the price of gold.<ref name="McCally117" /> Millinery was a $17-million-a-year industry<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;310.</ref> that motivated plume harvesters to lay in wait at nests of [[egret]]s and other large birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve.<ref name="McCally117" /> Many hunters refused to participate after watching the gruesome results of a plume hunt.<ref name="McCally117" /><ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;126.</ref> Still, plumes from Everglades wading birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. A dealer in New York paid at least 60&nbsp;hunters to provide him with "almost anything that wore feathers, but particularly the Herons, Spoonbills, and showy birds". Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.<ref>McCally, p.117<U+2013>118.</ref> 

Plume harvesting became a dangerous business. The [[Audubon Society]] became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1905, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake.

The canals proposed by Wright were unsuccessful in making the lands south of Lake Okeechobee fulfill the promises made by real estate developers to local farmers. The winter of 1922 was unseasonably wet and the region was underwater. The town of Moore Haven received {{convert|46|in|mm}} of rain in six weeks in 1924.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;183.</ref> Engineers were pressured to regulate the water flow, not only for farmers but also for commercial fishers, who often requested conflicting water levels in the lake.

=== 1926 Miami Hurricane ===
{{main|1926 Miami Hurricane}}

The 1920s brought several favorable conditions that helped the land and population boom, one of which was an absence of any severe storms. The last severe hurricane, in 1906, had struck the Florida Keys. Many homes were constructed hastily and poorly as a result of this lull in storms.<ref name="steinberg">Steinberg, Theodore (October, 1997). "Do-It-Yourself Deathscape: The Unnatural History of Natural Disaster in South Florida", ''Environmental History'', '''2''' (4), p.&nbsp;414<U+2013>438.</ref> However, on [[September 18]], [[1926]], a storm that became known as the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] struck with winds over {{convert|140|mph|km/h}}, and caused massive devastation. The [[storm surge]] was as high as {{convert|15|ft|m}} in some places. Henry Flagler's opulent Royal Palm Hotel was destroyed along with many other hotels and buildings. Most people who died did so when they ran out into the street in disbelief while the [[eye (cyclone)|eye of the hurricane]] passed over, not knowing the wind was coming in from the other direction. "The lull lasted 35&nbsp;minutes, and during that time the streets of the city became crowded with people", wrote Richard Gray, the local weather chief. "As a result, many lives were lost during the second phase of the storm."<ref name="Merzer2006">Melzer, Martin ([[September 17]], [[2006]]). "On the 80th Anniversary of Disastrous 1926 Hurricane, Forecasters Sound the Alarm: It Will Happen Again", ''The Miami Herald''.</ref> In Miami alone, 115 people were counted dead<U+2014>although the true figure may have been as high as 175, because death totals were [[racial segregation|racially segregated]].<ref name="steinberg"/> More than 25,000&nbsp;people were homeless in the city. The town of Moore Haven, bordering Lake Okeechobee, was hardest hit. A [[levee]] built of muck collapsed, drowning almost 400 of the town's entire 1,200 residents.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;188.</ref> The tops of Lake Okeechobee levees were only {{convert|18|to|24|in|cm}} above the lake itself and the engineers were aware of the danger. Two days before the hurricane, an engineer predicted, "[i]f we have a blow, even a gale, Moore Haven is going under water". The engineer lost his wife and daughter in the flood.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;134.</ref>

[[Image:Okeechobee hurricane 1928 noaa pics.jpg|upright|thumb|Pictures of the destruction in the town of [[Okeechobee, Florida|Okeechobee]] in 1928]]

The City of Miami responded to the hurricane by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. ''The Miami Herald'' declared two weeks after the storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the [[American Red Cross]] was able to collect only $3&nbsp;million of $5&nbsp;million needed.<ref name="steinberg"/> The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20&nbsp;million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it;<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;140.</ref> more than $14&nbsp;million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;342.</ref>

=== 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane ===

{{main|1928 Okeechobee Hurricane}}

The weather was unremarkable for two years. In 1928, construction was completed on the [[Tamiami Trail]], named because it was the only road spanning between [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and Miami. The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone, filled it with rock and paved over it.<ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;344.</ref> Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered. However, on [[September 16]], [[1928]] came a massive storm, now known as the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]]. Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1,770 (according to the Red Cross) to 3,000 or more.<ref name="Brochu">{{cite web|author=Brochu, Nicole Sterghos|year=2003|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/sfl-ahurricane14sep14,0,574121.story?page=2|title=Florida's Forgotten Storm: the Hurricane of 1928|publisher=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref> Many were swept away and never recovered.<ref name="steinberg"/><ref>Douglas, p.&nbsp;346.</ref> The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade. The catastrophe made national news, and although the governor again refused aid, after he toured the area and counted 126&nbsp;bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm, he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup,<ref name="steinberg"/> and declared in a telegram: "Without exaggeration, the situation in the storm area beggars description".<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;194.</ref>

=== Herbert Hoover Dike ===
[[Image:Army CoE sign Hoover Dike.jpg|thumb|left|A sign advertising the completion of the [[Herbert Hoover Dike]]]]

The focus of government agencies quickly shifted to the control of floods rather than drainage. The Okeechobee Flood Control District, financed by both state and federal funds, was created in 1929. President [[Herbert Hoover]] toured the towns affected by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane and, an engineer himself, ordered the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] to assist the communities surrounding the lake.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;198<U+2013>199.</ref> Between 1930 and 1937, a dike {{convert|66|mi|km}} long was built around the southern edge of the lake, and a shorter one around the northern edge. It was {{convert|34|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|3.5|ft|m}} thick on the lake side, {{convert|3|ft|m}} thick on the top, and {{convert|2|ft|m}} thick toward land. Control of the [[Hoover Dike]] and the waters of [[Lake Okeechobee]] were delegated to federal powers: the United States declared legal limits of the lake to be {{convert|14|ft|m}} and {{convert|17|ft|m}}.<ref name="stephan"/>

A massive canal {{convert|80|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|6|ft|m}} deep was also dug through the [[Caloosahatchee River]]; when the lake rose too high, the excess water left through the canal to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Exotic trees were planted along the north shore levee: [[Casuarina|Australian pine]]s, [[Eucalyptus|Australian oak]]s, [[willow]]s, and [[bamboo]].<ref name="stephan"/> More than $20&nbsp;million was spent on the entire project. Sugarcane production soared after the dike and canal were built. The populations of the small towns surrounding the lake jumped from 3,000 to 9,000 after [[World War II]].<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;199<U+2013>200.</ref>

== Drought ==

The effects of the Hoover Dike were seen immediately. An extended drought occurred in the 1930s, and with the wall preventing water leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust, and salty ocean water entered Miami's wells. When the city brought in an expert to investigate, he discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's [[groundwater]]<U+2014>here, it appeared on the surface. Draining the Everglades removed this groundwater, which was replaced by ocean water seeping into the area's wells.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;9.</ref> In 1939, a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Underground peat fires burned roots of trees and plants without burning the plants in some places.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;142.</ref> Scientists who took soil samples before draining had not taken into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades was mixed with a bacteria that added to the process of decomposition underwater because it was not mixed with oxygen. As soon as the water was drained and oxygen mixed with the soil, the bacteria began to break down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved on to stilts and {{convert|8|ft|m}} of topsoil was lost.<ref>Lodge, p.&nbsp;38.</ref>

=== Conservation attempts ===
[[Image:Harry Truman at Everglades National Park.jpg|thumb|President [[Harry Truman]] dedicating [[Everglades National Park]] on [[December 6]], [[1947]]]]
{{main|Everglades National Park}}

Conservationists concerned about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was [[Charles Torrey Simpson]], who retired from the [[Smithsonian Institution]] to Miami when he was 53&nbsp;years old in 1905. Simpson, nicknamed "The Sage of Biscayne Bay", wrote several books about tropical plant life around Miami. His backyard contained a tropical hardwood hammock, which he estimated he showed to approximately 50,000&nbsp;people. Though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development, in ''Ornamental Gardening in Florida'', he wrote, "Mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and beautiful things this nature has lavished upon him".<ref>La Plante, Leah (1995), "The Sage of Biscayne Bay: Charles Torrey Simpson's Love Affair with South Florida", ''Tequesta'', No. LV,  p.&nbsp;61<U+2013>82.</ref>

The idea of a national park for the Everglades arose in 1928 when a Miami land developer named [[Ernest F. Coe]] established the Everglades Tropical National Park Association. It had enough support to be declared a national park by Congress in 1934, but there was not enough money during the  [[Great Depression]] to purchase the proposed {{convert|2000000|acre|km2}} for the park. It took another 13&nbsp;years for it to be dedicated on [[December 6]], [[1947]].

== Flood control ==

Coinciding with the dedication of Everglades National Park, 1947 in south Florida saw two hurricanes and a wet season responsible for {{convert|100|in|cm}} of rain, ending the decade-long drought. Although there were no human casualties, cattle and deer were drowned and standing water was left in suburban areas for months. Agricultural interests lost approximately $59&nbsp;million. The embattled head of the Everglades Drainage District carried a gun for protection after being threatened.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;219.</ref>  

[[Image:Florida Topo map with canals and designated Everglades areas.jpg|thumb|Divisions set by the Central & Southern Florida Flood Control Project: Everglades Agricultural Area, Water Conservation Areas, canals (in blue), and [[Everglades National Park]]]]
=== Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project ===

In 1948 Congress approved the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C&SF) and consolidated the Everglades Drainage District and the Okeechobee Flood Control District under the new project.<ref name="light">Light, Stephen, J. Walter Dineen "Water Control in the Everglades: A Historical Perspective" in ''Everglades : The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. ISBN  0963403028</ref> The C&SF used four principles in flood management: levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 the project built a levee {{convert|100|mi|km}} long between the eastern Everglades and suburbs from Palm Beach to [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], and blocked the flow of water into populated areas. Between 1954 and 1963 they divided the Everglades into basins. In the northern Everglades were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. In the southern Everglades was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which either released water in dryer times or removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times of flood. The WCAs took up approximately 37&nbsp;percent of the original Everglades.<ref>Lodge, p.&nbsp;224.</ref>

During the 1950s and 1960s the [[South Florida metropolitan area]] grew four times as fast as the rest of the nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6&nbsp;million people moved to south Florida: 1,000&nbsp;people moved to Miami every week.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;229.</ref> Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas.<ref name="Caulfield55">Caulfield, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams, school overcrowding, crime, overloaded sewage treatment plants, and for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.<ref>Carter, Luther ([[June 4]], [[1976]]). "Dade County: The Politics of Managing Urban Growth", ''Science'', '''192''' (4243), p.&nbsp;982<U+2013>985.</ref>

The C&SF constructed over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. It produced a film, characterized by author Michael Grunwald as [[propaganda]], called ''Waters of Destiny'' that declared its mission was to tame nature and make the Everglades useful.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;220<U+2013>221.</ref> Everglades National Park management and Marjory Stoneman Douglas initially supported the C&SF, as it promised to maintain the Everglades and manage the water responsibly. However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas: "The aesthetic appeal of the Park can never be as strong as the demands of home and livelihood. The manatee and the orchid mean something to people in an abstract way, but the former cannot line their purse, nor the latter fill their empty bellies."<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;226.</ref> 

Establishment of the C&SF made Everglades National Park completely dependent upon another political entity for its survival.<ref name="gilmour">Gimour, Robert, et al (Winter 1975<U+2013>1976). "Environmental Preservation and Politics: The Significance of 'Everglades Jetport'", ''Political Science Quarterly'', '''90''' (4), p.&nbsp;719<U+2013>738.</ref> One of the C&SF's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail on the northern border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The years of 1962 to 1965 were drought years for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the [[Biscayne Aquifer]]<U+2014>the fresh water source for South Florida<U+2014>to stay filled.<ref>Caulfield, p.&nbsp;53<U+2013>54.</ref> Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was reduced by half; otters nearly became extinct.<ref name="Caulfield55" /> The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90&nbsp;percent from the 1940s.<ref name="sklar">Sklar, Fred, et al (April, 2005). "The Ecological-Societal Underpinnings of Everglades Restoration", ''Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,'' '''3''' (2), p.&nbsp;161<U+2013>169.</ref> When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C&SF for assistance, the C&SF offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the [[mangrove]]s and into [[Florida Bay]]. Though the C&SF refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering the east side of the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name="Caulfield55" />

=== Everglades Agricultural Area ===

[[Image:Everglades canal.jpg|thumb|right|A 2003 U.S. Geological Survey photo showing the border between Water Conservation Area 3 (bottom) with water, and [[Everglades National Park]], dry (top)]]

The C&SF established {{convert|470000|acre|km2}} for the Everglades Agricultural Area<U+2014>27&nbsp;percent of the Everglades prior to development.<ref>Lodge, p.&nbsp;223.</ref> In the late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of [[manganese sulfate]] to Everglades muck produced a profitable harvest for vegetables. Adding {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of the compound was more cost effective than adding {{convert|1|ST|MT}} of manure.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;159<U+2013>160.</ref> The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though [[sod]], beans, lettuce, celery, and rice are also grown. Sugarcane became consolidated as an industry more than any other crop; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed to U.S. Sugar and they produced 86&nbsp;percent of Everglades sugar.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers' coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery. Potential employees<U+2014>primarily young black men<U+2014>were lured from all over the U.S. by the promise of jobs, but they were held financially responsible for training, transportation, room and board and other costs. Quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time. By 1942, U.S. Sugar was indicted for [[peonage]] in federal court, though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality. U.S. Sugar benefited significantly by the [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo on Cuban goods]] beginning in the early 1960s.<ref>Carter, p.&nbsp;161.</ref> Prior to the regime of [[Fidel Castro]], {{convert|47000|acre|km2}} of sugarcane were harvested in Florida in 1958; by the 1964<U+2013>1965 season, {{convert|228000|acre|km2}} were harvested. The region went from two sugar mills in 1959 to six by 1962, one of which in Belle Glade set several world records for sugar production.<ref name="snyder">Snyder G.H., J. Davidson, "Everglades Agriculture: Past, Present and Future" in  ''Everglades : The Ecosystem and its Restoration'', Steven Davis and John Ogden, eds. (1994), St. Lucie Press. ISBN  0963403028</ref>

Fields in the EAA are typically {{convert|40|acre|km2}} , bordered by canals on two sides, that are connected to larger canals where water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops. The water level for sugarcane is ideally maintained at {{convert|20|in|cm}} below the surface soil, and after the cane is harvested, the stalks are burned.<ref>Lodge, p.&nbsp;225<U+2013>226.</ref> Vegetables require more fertilizer than sugarcane, though the fields may resemble the historic hydrology of the Everglades by being flooded in the wet season. Sugarcane, however, requires water in the dry season. The fertilizers used on vegetables, along with high concentrations of [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] that are the byproduct of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production, were pumped into WCAs south of the EAA, predominantly to Everglades National Park. The introduction of large amounts of these elements provided opportunities for exotic plants to take hold in the Everglades.<ref>McCally, p.&nbsp;172<U+2013>173.</ref> One of the defining characteristics of natural Everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient-poor environment, and the introduction of fertilizers began to change that.<ref>Grunwald, p.&nbsp;283<U+2013>284.</ref>

== Turning point ==

A turning point for development in the Everglades came in 1969 when an expanded airport was proposed as [[Miami International Airport]] outgrew its capacities. Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) purchased {{convert|39|sqmi|km2}} in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C&SF, management of Everglades National Park or the Department of the Interior. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the airport from ''The Miami Herald'' the day it was announced.<ref name="gilmour"/> The DCPA bulldozed the land it had purchased, and laid a single runway they declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], [[Dulles International Airport|Dulles]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK]], and [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] airports combined; the location chosen was {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: "This is going to be one of the great population centers of America. We will do our best to meet our responsibilities and the responsibilities of all men to exercise dominion over the land, sea, and air above us as the higher order of man intends."<ref>Caulfield, p.&nbsp;61.</ref> 

The C&SF brought the jetport proposal to national attention by mailing letters to 100&nbsp;conservation groups in the U.S. informing them of what was taking place.<ref name="gilmour"/> Initial local press reaction condemned conservation groups who immediately opposed the project. ''[[Business Week]]'' reported real estate prices jumped from $200 to $800 an acre surrounding the planned location, and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine wrote of the anticipation of the commercial interests in the area.<ref name="gilmour"/> The first sentence of the study of the environmental impact of the jetport completed by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] read, "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities&nbsp;... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park".<ref>Grunwald,&nbsp;p.257.</ref> The airport was intended to support a community of a million people and employ 60,000. The DCPA director was reported in ''[[Time]]'' magazine saying, "I'm more interested in people than alligators. This is the ideal place as far as aviation is concerned."<ref name="timejets">
