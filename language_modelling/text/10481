'''Prayer'''  is an active effort to communicate with a [[deity]] or spirit either to offer [[praise]], to make a request, seek guidance, confess sins, or simply to express one's thoughts and emotions. The words of the prayer may either be a set [[hymn]] or [[incantation]], or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person's own words.

==Forms of prayer==

[[Image:Mosque.Qibla.01.jpg|thumb|right|Muslims at prayer]]
The great spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, graces said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Native Americans dance. Sufis whirl. Hindus chant. Orthodox Jews sway their bodies back and forth. Quakers keep silent.

Among these methodologies are a variety of approaches to understanding prayer:
* The belief that the finite can actually communicate with the infinite;
* The belief that the infinite is interested in communicating with the finite;
* The belief that the prayer is listened to and may or may not get a response;
* The belief that prayer is intended to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, rather than to influence the recipient;
* The belief that prayer is intended to train a person to focus on the recipient through philosophy and intellectual contemplation;
* The belief that prayer is intended to enable a person to gain a direct experience of the recipient;
* The belief that prayer is intended to affect the very fabric of reality itself;
* The belief that the recipient expects or appreciates prayer

The existence of prayer is attested in written sources as early as 5000 years ago. [[anthropology|Anthropologists]] believe that the earliest intelligent modern humans practiced something that we would recognize today as prayer.

==The act of prayer==
[[Image:Budhist_prayer-KayEss-1.jpeg|thumb|left|Buddhist prayer in [[Thailand]].]]
Praying has many different forms. 
Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily "thought life", in which one is in constant communication with God. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses.  There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to "hear" the answers. Some may be audible, others may interpret healing, or specific physicals signs as answers to their prayer. How the answer is given and in what time frame it is given can be as varied as the requests themselves.
Some outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil; ringing a bell; burning incense or paper; lighting a candle or candles; facing a specific direction (i.e. towards [[Mecca]] or the East); making the [[sign of the cross]]. One less noticeable act related to prayer is fasting.

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. Prayer may be unconscious. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Prayer in [[Abrahamic religions]]==

===Prayer in the Bible ===
In the common [[Bible]] of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, various forms of prayer appear; the most common forms being [[petition]], [[thanksgiving]] and [[worship]]. In many ways petition is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the "social approach" to prayer. In this view, a person appeals to God in prayer, and asks for his or her needs to be fulfilled; God listens to prayer, and chooses to answer directly, indirectly or not at all. This is one of the primary approaches to prayer, but by no means the only one, found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in [[rabbinic literature]] such as the [[Talmud]].
<div class="boilerplate" id="see">
:''See also: [[Tanakh]], [[New Testament]], [[Prayer in the Hebrew Bible]] & [[Prayer in the New Testament]]''</div>

===Jewish prayer===
{{main|Jewish services}}
Jews pray three times a day, or more on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews the world over, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''kavanah'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] ("Hear O Israel") and the [[Amidah]] ("the standing prayer").

Jews consider the best form of prayer is to pray together, for example you would need 10 people (minyan) to pray in synagogue. They believe the more people, the stronger the connection.

===Christian prayer===
{{see|Prayer in Christianity}}
{{see|Christian Worship}}
[[Image:Panagia.jpg|right|thumb|18th c. [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]-style bronze [[panagia]] from [[Jerusalem]], showing the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in the [[orans]] prayer posture.]]
Christian prayers are very varied.  They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]].  Probably the most common and universal prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]] which is how Jesus told his disciples to pray.  

Christians pray to God (without specifying a person of the Trinity); or to the Father, the Son or the Holy Spirit (or some combination of them). Some Christians (e.g., Catholics, Orthodox) will also ask the righteous in heaven and "in Christ," such as Virgin Mary or other saints to intercede  by praying on their behalf. ([[Intercession of saints]])

It is customary among Protestants the world over to end prayers with "In [[Jesus]]' Name, Amen" or "In the name of [[Christ]], Amen". Other formulaic closures include "through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever", and "in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit". However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply "[[Amen]]" (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement).

There is also the form of prayer called [[hesychast]] which is a repetitious type of prayer for the purpose of meditation.  In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]];  In the Eastern Church (the  [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the  [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. 

Prayers said by [[Christian]]s are described in the article on [[Prayer in Christianity]].

====Prevalence====
Some modalities of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM) employ prayer. A [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm survey released in May 2004] by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

===Christian Science prayer===

[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality (the "[[Kingdom of Heaven]]" in Biblical terms) into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas: the latter is the only true reality. Prayer can heal the distortion.  Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact and inherently lovable.

===Islamic prayer===
[[Image:Supplicating Pilgrim at Masjid Al Haram. Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|right|thumb|[[Islam|Muslims]] praying at the [[Hajj]], [[Mecca]].]]
:''Main article: [[Salat]]''
[[Muslim]]s pray a brief ritualistic prayer called ''[[salat]]'' or ''salah'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]], five times a day. The "call for prayer" (''[[adhan]]'' or ''azaan''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer . There are also many standard [[dua]]s or supplications, also in Arabic, to be recited at various times, ''e.g.'' for one's parents, after salah, before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.

===Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> prayer===
[[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]], the [[B<U+00E1>b]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bah<U+00E1>]] have revealed many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others.  [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith|Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Prayers|obligatory prayers]] revealed by [[Bah<U+00E1>'u'll<U+00E1>h]]. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. This is the text of the short prayer:  ''I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.''  Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.

===Neopagan prayers===
Many modern [[Neo-Paganism|Neopagans]] pray to various gods. The most commonly worshiped and prayed to gods are those of Pre-Christian Europe, such as [[Celtic Mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse Mythology|Norse]] or [[Greek Mythology|Graeco-Roman]] gods. Prayer can vary from sect to sect, and with some (such as Wicca) prayer may also be associated with ritual [[magick]].

==Prayer in [[Dharmic religion]]s==
In contrast with [[Western religion]], Eastern religion for the most part discards [[worship]] and places devotional emphasis on the practice of [[meditation]] alongside scriptural study.

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] praying at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Thailand]].]]
In certain Buddhist sects, prayer accompanies meditation. [[Buddhism]] for the most part sees prayer as a secondary, supportive practice to [[meditation]] and scriptural study. [[Gautama Buddha]] claimed that human beings possess the capacity and potential to be liberated, or [[Enlightenment (concept)|enlightened]], through [[contemplation]], leading to insight. Prayer is seen mainly as a powerful psycho-physical practice that can enhance meditation.

* In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[Ch<U+00E1>n]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings. However it can also be a way of expressing respect and appreciation to the individual person of the Buddha, who is said to still exist though in a higher dimension. 
* The [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] emphasises an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices similar to prayer. It also posits the existence of various deities. But how practitioners relate to them will depend upon the 'level' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may ''invoke'' the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has 'become' the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is [[shunyata]].
* [[Pure Land]] Buddhism emphasises the recitation of prayer-like [[mantra]]s by devotees. On one level it is said that reciting these mantras can ensure rebirth into a spiritual 'pure land' after death, where one may work further towards one's enlightenment with greater ease. On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realisation. 

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasised the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer - asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hindu prayer===
{{main|Prayer in Hinduism}}

[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''pr<U+0101>rthan<U+0101>''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a person (as in [[Krishna]], [[Shiva]]) or simply plain formless meditation as practiced ancient sages. All of these are directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]].  Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and detroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities.

Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Prayer in Jainism===
Although [[Jainism|Jain]]s believe that no spirit or divine being can assist them on their path, they do hold some influence, and on special occasions, Jains will pray for right knowledge to the twenty-four ''Tirthankaras'' (saintly teachers).

<!--
==Philosophical paradoxes of prayer==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=December 2006}}
There are a number of philosophical paradoxes involving prayer to an omnipotent [[God]], namely:
* If a person deserves God to give him the thing he prays for, why doesn't God give it to him, even without prayer? And if a person is not deserving of it, then even if that person does pray and request it, should it be given just because of his prayer? 
* Is it necessary to pray with speech? Doesn't God know the thoughts of all people?
* If God is all-knowing, then doesn't God already know what we are going to ask for before we pray? 
::In Christianity, this paradox is acknowledged in the [[discourse on ostentation]], which forms part of the [[Sermon on the Mount]].
* Do human beings actually have the ability to praise an omniscient and omnipotent God?  Praising God is difficult to do without describing God, yet how can a person know anything about God's ultimate nature? This question was the subject of heated debate among many religious philosophers; one such debate took place in the 14th century between [[Gregory Palamas]] and [[Barlaam of Calabria]]. 
* The prerequisite of asking for a favour is faith in the recipient of the prayer. But asking to change an aspect of creation seems to be expressing a dissatisfaction with the way things are - and hence not trusting the "plan." This means faithfully asking for divine intervention is a paradox, requiring faith and displaying a lack of faith at the same time.

Many of these questions have been discussed in Jewish, Christian and Muslim writings from the medieval period onward. The 900s to 1200s saw some of the most fertile discussion on these questions, during the period of [[Neo-Platonic]] and Neo-Aristotelian philosophy.  See [[Aristotelian view of God]]. Discussion of these problems never ceased entirely, but they did fall mostly from the public view for several centuries, until [[The Enlightenment]] reignited philosophical inquiry into theological issues. 

All of these questions have been discussed in many Jewish, Christian and Muslim religious texts. There was much intellectual cross-fertilization between Jews, Christians and Muslims during parts of the middle-ages, and so there is much convergence among some of the rationalist philosophers of that era. Many of these texts offer proposed resolutions to some or all of these paradoxes.

==Approaches to prayer==
===Direct petitions to God===
From Biblical times to today, the most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer.<ref>Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]</ref>  In this view, a person directly confronts God in prayer, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled.  God listens to the prayer, and may or may not choose to answer in the way one asks of Him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.

===The educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p. XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).
<!--
Among Christian theologians... (please add examples here)  Among Muslim theologians.... (please add examples here).
-->

===The Kabbalistic view of prayer===
Adherents of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) base their prayers on those found in the [[siddur]], the traditional Jewish prayer text. However, they add to these prayers a number of kavanot, mystical statements of intention. Adherents of kabbalah reject both the rationalist and social approach to prayer. Instead, their approach ascribes a higher meaning to the act of prayer; Prayer affects the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. For these Kabbalists, every prayer, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word of every prayer, has a precise meaning and a precise effect.

In Kabbalah and related mystical belief systems, adherents claim intimate knowledge about the way in which the divine relates to us and the physical universe in which we live. For people with this view, prayers can literally affect the mystical forces of the universe and repair the fabric of creation.

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Jacob Emden]].

[[Image:190448 siddur.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jew]]ish [[Siddur]]]]

===The rationalist approach===
In this view, ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists; it became popular in Jewish, Christian and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===The experiential approach===
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual. It also has some similarities with the Kabbalistic view, but it lacks the Kabbalistic emphasis on the importance of individual words and letters.

==Experimental evaluation of prayer==
A famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether or not prayer had a physical effect on the external environment was conducted by [[Francis Galton]] in [[1872]]. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.<ref>Galton F. Statistical inquiries into the efficacy of prayer. ''Fortnightly Review'' 1872;68:125-35. [http://www.abelard.org/galton/galton.htm Online version].</ref> While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of confounders, it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

A number of studies have suggested that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently. One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.<ref>Byrd RC. Positive therapeutic effects of intercessory prayer in a coronary care unit population. ''South Med J'' 1988;81:826-9. PMID 3393937.</ref> Sicher ''et al'' suggested statistically significant benefits to a group being prayed for ten years later.<ref>Sicher F, Targ E, Moore D 2nd, Smith HS. A randomized double-blind study of the effect of distant healing in a population with advanced AIDS. Report of a small scale study. ''West J Med'' 1998;169:356-63. PMID 9866433.</ref> Another such study was reported by Harris ''et al''.<ref>Harris WS, Gowda M, Kolb JW, Strychacz CP, Vacek JL, Jones PG, Forker A, O'Keefe JH, McCallister BD. ''A randomized, controlled trial of the effects of remote, intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients admitted to the coronary care unit.'' Arch Intern Med 1999;159:2273-8. PMID 10547166.</ref> Critics claim Byrd's 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began.<ref>Tessman I and Tessman J "Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims," Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000.</ref>
One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990-96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.<ref>Leibovici L. Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial. ''BMJ'' 2001;323:1450-1. PMID 11751349.</ref>

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.<ref>O'Laoire S. An experimental study of the effects of distant, intercessory prayer on self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. ''Altern Ther Health Med'' 1997;3:38-53. PMID 9375429.</ref> A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.<ref>Aviles JM, Whelan SE, Hernke DA, Williams BA, Kenny KE, O'Fallon WM, Kopecky SL. Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial. ''Mayo Clin Proc'' 2001;76:1192-8. PMID 11761499.</ref> Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.<ref>Krucoff MW, Crater SW, Gallup D, Blankenship JC, Cuffe M, Guarneri M, Krieger RA, Kshettry VR, Morris K, Oz M, Pichard A, Sketch MH Jr, Koenig HG, Mark D, Lee KL. Music, imagery, touch, and prayer as adjuncts to interventional cardiac care: the Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings (MANTRA) II randomised study. ''Lancet'' 2005;366:211-7. PMID 16023511.</ref> In another similar study published in the American Heart Journal in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.<ref>Benson H, Dusek JA ''et al.'' "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: a multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer." ''American Heart Journal''. 2006 April; 151(4): p. 762-4.</ref>

Many accept that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery.  (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].)  Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, "the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live."<ref>[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&action=detail&articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit]. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.</ref> Other practices such as [[Yoga]], [[Tai Chi Chuan|Tai Chi]], and [[Meditation]] may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

However, a 2005 study published in the American Heart Journal<ref>Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: A multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer [http://www.ahjonline.com/article/PIIS0002870305006496/abstract]</ref> indicated that bypass surgery patients who were aware that they were being prayed for developed more complications than patients who were unaware of prayers on their behalf, and patients who were unaware that they were being prayed for had more major complications than those who were not prayed for as part of the study.<ref>The Deity in the DataWhat the latest prayer study tells us about God.[http://www.slate.com/id/2139373/]</ref> 

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. As {{nasb|Deuteronomy|6:16|Deuteronomy 6:16}} states, "You shall not test the Lord thy God".<ref>Deuteronomy 6:16[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%206:16;&version=49;]</ref> Others wonder how genuine prayer can be if it in collaboration with statistical research.

==Historical polytheistic prayer==
In ancient religions of Greeks and Romans ([[Ancient Greek religion]], [[Roman religion]]), ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.  The [[Iguvine Tables]] contain a supplication that can be translated, "If anything was said improperly, if anything was done improperly, let it be as if it were done correctly."

The formalism and formulaic nature of these prayers led them to be written down in language that may have only been partially understood by the writer, and our texts of these prayers may in fact be garbled.  Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language.  The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper.  The Roman formula was ''do ut des'': "I give, so that you may give in return."  [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.

==Etymology==
''Pray'' entered [[Middle English]] as ''preyen, prayen,''and  ''preien'' around 1290, recorded in ''The early'' ''South-English Legendary'' I. 112/200: ''And preide is fader wel {{latinx|<U+021D>}}erne,'' in the sense of "to ask earnestly." The next recorded use in 1300 is simply "to pray." It came from the [[Old French]] ''preier,'' "to request" (first seen in ''La S<U+00E9>quence de Ste. Eulalie, ''ca. 880) In modern French ''prier,'' "to pray," the stem-vowel is leveled under that of the stem-stressed forms, ''il prie'', etc. The origin of the word before this time is less certain. Compare the Italian ''Pregare ''"to ask" or more rarely "pray for something" and Spanish ''preguntar ''"ask." One possibility is the [[Late Latin]] ''precare'' (as seen in [[Priscian]]), [[classical Latin]] ''precari'' "to entreat, pray" from Latin ''precari,'' from ''precor, ''from ''prec-, prex'' "request, entreaty, prayer." ''Precor ''was used by [[Virgil]], [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Ovid]] in the [[accusative]]. [[Dative]] forms are also found in Livy and Aurelius Propertius. With ''pro'' in the [[ablative]], it is found in Plinius Valerianus<U+2019>s ''physic, ''and Aurelius Augustinus<U+2019>s''' '''''Epistulae''. It also could be used for a thing. From classical times, it was used in both religious and secular senses. ''Prex'' is recorded as far back as T. Maccius Plautus (254 B.C. <U+2013> ?). Other senses of ''precor'' include "to wish well or ill to any one," "to hail, salute," or "address one with a wish." The Latin ''orare'' "to speak" later took over the role of ''precari ''to mean "pray."

The Spanish form ''preguntar'' was first recorded in ''El Cantar de Mio <U+00C7>id'' (ca. 1150)'' '' and possibly comes from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''praecontare,'' an alteration of the Classical Latin ''percontari, perconto, percontor'' "interrogate" although the Spanish verb for "pray" today is ''rezar,'' which previously meant "to say" from the Latin ''recitare''. The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''pregar ''"to preach," or less commonly, "to exhort," is also mentioned at times, although it is from the Latin ''praedicare'','' ''"to cry in public, proclaim," hence "to declare, state, say," in medieval Latin "to preach," and in Logic "to assert," from ''pr<U+00E6>'' "forth" + ''dicare'' "to make known, proclaim." Compare the Spanish ''predicar''. More closely related is the Portuguese ''perguntar,'' "to ask" and by extension "ask for." ''Pray'' is akin to [[Old English]] ''gefr[AE]ge ''"hearsay, report," ''fricgan, frignan, frinan ''to ask, inquire, [[Old High German]] ''fraga ''question, ''fragen ''"to ask" (in modern German, "pray" is ''beten, ''"question" ''frage''), [[Old Norse]] ''frett ''"question," ''fregna ''"to inquire, find out," [[Gothic]] ''fraihman ''"to find out by inquiry," [[Tocharian A]] ''prak- ''"to ask," [[Sanskrit]] roots, ''pracch- prask-,'' ''pras ''"interrogation," and ''prcchati ''"he asks"
