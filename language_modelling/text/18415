'''<U+00DA>st<U+00ED> nad Labem Zoological Gardens''' is a [[zoo]] located on the edge of [[Kr<U+00E1>sn<U+00E9> B<U+0159>ezno]], close to the centre of the city of [[<U+00DA>st<U+00ED> nad Labem]] in the [[Czech Republic]]. The gardens cover an area of {{Convert|26|ha|abbr=on}}, and lets visitors view rare and endangered species of animals such as [[orangutan]]s, [[Somali Wild Ass|Somali donkeys]], [[rhinoceroses]], and [[Malaysian sun bear]]s. Open throughout the year, the gardens host regular displays&mdash;the training of [[sea lion]]s, a parade of elephants through the gardens, flying display of [[birds of prey]], rides on ponies, and a range of other activities.

The zoo is a member of the [[European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]] (EAZA), the [[World Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (WAZA), and the [[Union of Czech and Slovak Zoological Gardens]] (UCSZ).

Both the upper gate ([[Dobetice]]) and the lower main gate (Kr<U+00E1>sn<U+00E9> B<U+0159>ezno) include ticket offices, but during the winter season the upper ticket office is closed.

==History==

The [[Zoo]] in <U+00DA>st<U+00ED> was founded in 1908 by [[Heinrich Lumpe]], a businessman and dealer in metal goods, and a respected [[ornithologist]] and [[nature]] lover. Lumpe purchased {{Convert|6|ha}} of land and set up a private bird sanctuary that was known as Lumpepark. On this property, he built the Little Dwarf castle, a system of cascades and waterfalls, and a lake with a fountain in the lower part of the property. In 1914 the park was opened to the public.<ref name="zoo_history"/>

After Lumpe's death in 1936, the park was kept up, largely thanks to the senior gardener and other staff. After [[World War II]], the Czech Republic took over the park and turned it into a zoo. The new cages and paddocks were installed, and the area was gradually enlarged to its current {{Convert|26|ha}}.<ref name="zoo_history"/>

In the 1970s the zoo started updating their exhibits, with glass replacing bars and more spacious paddocks for the animals.<ref name="zoo_history"/>

==Animals==

The zoo is home to about 1,500 animals of 240 species, many of them under the framework of the [[European Breeding Programme]]s.

==Other attractions==

for children, the zoo includes <U+201C>Children<U+2019>s World<U+201D> (which contains models of animals with slides), the <U+201C>Children<U+2019>s ZOO<U+201D> (a petting zoo with domesticated animals), and <U+201C>Dinosaur Nature Trail<U+201D> (with models of prehistoric animals).<ref name="usti"/>

In 2007 the zoo opened ZooTrain, a tram that (for a fee) transports visitors from the lower to the upper entrance of the zoo.<ref name="zoo_train"/> In 2010 the zoo opened a restaurant in the lower part of the zoo, which is open to zoo visitors but also has a separate entrance for people who only want to come to the restaurant.<ref name="zoo_rest"/>
