The '''Series of 1902,''' also known as the Second Bureau Issue, is a set of definitive postage stamps in fourteen denominations ranging between one cent and five dollars, produced by the U. S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and issued by the United States Post office.  Two denominations appeared in November and December 1902 and the other ten were released between January and June of 1903.  Also considered part of the series is a fifteenth stamp which appeared in November 1903<U+2014>a second version of the 2<U+00A2> value, the original having faced severe criticism. This series, particularly noted for its exceptional ornateness and opulence of design, remained in circulation until late 1908, when it was superseded by the [[Washington-Franklin  Issues]].

Despite its name, the Second Bureau Issue was, in fact, the first definitive series designed exclusively by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  For its first issue (1894), the Bureau, had not had sufficient time to produce new images, and so, chose to retain the existing stamp designs produced by the American Banknote Company for the 1890 series, modifying these only slightly by adding triangles in the upper corners of the stamps.  Only four years later did the Bureau have the opportunity to prove that it was capable of something more than this utilitarian effort, when the Post Office elected to issue a commemorative set in honor of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition. The resulting [[Trans-Mississippi Issue]]<ref>{{cite web|url=[http://www.1847usa.com/ByYear/1898.htm |title=1898 U.S. Postage Stamps |publisher=1847usa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref> was one of the most admired of all U. S. Stamp sets, designed in an elaborate and flamboyant visual style surely intended to demonstrate that the Bureau could attain an unimpeachably high level of engraving creativity and craftsmanship.  The Bureau aimed at similar sumptuousness in its next commemorative series, the Pan-American Exposition Issue (1901)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1847usa.com/ByYear/1901.htm |title=1901 U.S. Postage Stamps |publisher=1847usa.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}</ref>, and this artistic approach then came to U. S. definitive stamps with the Series of 1902.  The style of these three series reflects a wider phenomenon found in the turn-of-the-twentieth-century American arts: a ubiquitous embrace of the profusely ornamental Beaux-Arts style offered by the "White City" complex erected at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

Post Office officials, in fact, had been so pleased with the Pan-American Issue that they were eager to produce a new definitive issue that would publicize their efforts,<ref name="Johl">{{cite book |title='''The United States Postage Stamps of the Twentieth Century, Volume I''' |year=1937 |publisher=H. L. Lindquist |first=Beverly |last=King |coauthors=Johl, Max}}, p. 26</ref> and instructed the Bureau "to employ special pains to produce a series particularly attractive and distinctive, and fully as creditable as the Pan American."<ref>Meekel<U+2019>s Weekly, March 1, 1902</ref>
The visual imagery of the 1902 stamp designs, replete with suggestions of architectural features such as caryatids, friezes, plinths, marble columns, etc., many of them iconographically suited to the persons depicted, was paralleled by an equally eclectic approach to typography,  several different fonts being employed for letters and numerals.  All fourteen original designs were the work of Raymond Ostrander Smith, whose designs for the Pan American series and the Trans-Mississippi Issue had won much acclaim. For the first time in a definitive set, the birth and death dates of the famous Americans depicted appeared flanking their images, a feature that would remain more common in commemorative issues.  

More traditional in the series of 1902 was its pantheon of celebrated Americans.  Nine of the denominations<U+2014>the 1<U+00A2>, 2<U+00A2>, 3<U+00A2>, 6<U+00A2>, 10<U+00A2>, 15<U+00A2>, 50<U+00A2>, $2 and $5<U+2014>depicted the same statesman who had appeared on the corresponding denominations of the First Bureau Series. Moreover, on the 4<U+00A2> and 5<U+00A2> stamps, Lincoln and Grant merely exchanged their previous roles.  Only three new subjects were chosen, but one of them represented a feminist breakthrough: Martha Washington, appearing on the 8<U+00A2> value, became the first woman ever featured on a U. S. definitive stamp.  The recently deceased Benjamin Harrison graced the 13<U+00A2> value<U+2014>the first stamp of that denomination ever offered by the U. S. Post Office; while the $1 issue, a value that had been devoted to Oliver Perry in the First Bureau Series, was now reassigned to a more recent naval hero, Admiral  David Farragut.

While the BEP clearly aimed at a reputation for uncommon excellence with the Series of 1902, this hope went unrealized.  When the stamp intended for widest circulation, the 2<U+00A2> Washington value, appeared in January 1903 it prompted numerous objections: the image of our first president was thought too weak, failing to reflect his iconic heroism.  Accordingly, in November 1903 the Post Office replaced this so-called "flag" Washington stamp with a new "shield" issue, which met greater favor.  By this time, Raymond Ostrander Smith had left the BEP, and the replacement was designed by [[Clair Aubrey Houston]]. But a more serious problem plagued the Series of 1902: that the existing technique of stamp production could not ensure the quality control needed to present designs of this opulence to best advantage.  For, one result of cramming so much detail into the stamps was that the images were larger than usual, leaving little white space at their edges.  This defect magnified an endemic problem of stamp production at that time: that many stamps emerged from the perforation machines with the design seriously off-center.  Lopsided examples of these stamps with portions of the images cut off are all too common; and relatively few collectors have succeeded in assembling a complete set of the 1902 series in which all the denominations are well-centered. 

In 1895, a year after the First Bureau Issue appeared, the illicit distribution of fair quality counterfeits of the 2<U+00A2> stamp prompted the Bureau to introduce a new type of in stamp paper, embedded with watermarks reading "U S P S" in double-lined letters. This watermarked paper was used for all subsequent Bureau stamps, including the Series of 1902, until 1910.

The Washington-Franklin Issues which gradually replaced the 1902 stamps beginning in late 1908 represented a drastic stylistic reaction to the profusion of varied elaboration ornament marking their predecessors.  All the stamps of the new series essentially conformed to a uniform design plan.

The early years of the 20th Century saw the development of technologically and commercially viable stamp-vending and stamp-affixing machines; and this phenomenon had important effects upon methods by which several stamps in the 1902 series were produced.  Because it proved impossible to devise machines that could reliable handle the 100-stamp panes of perforated stamps normally offered by the Post Office, vending manufacturers asked the Post Office instead for imperforate sheets of 400, which they would then cut into strips and incise with  special types of private perforations that were more easily handled by machine.  Accordingly, the Post Office produced imperforate versions of the 1<U+00A2> and 2<U+00A2> stamps (both released in October 1906), with imperforate 4<U+00A2> and 5<U+00A2> stamps following in 1908.  Also in 1908, the Post Office experimented with issuing coil strips of 1<U+00A2>,  2<U+00A2>  and 5<U+00A2> stamps for use in selected vending machines.  The 5<U+00A2> issue appeared only in "vertical coils" (i. e., the coil was a single stamp wide, each stamp was imperforate on both its left and right sides, while perforations separating the bottom of each stamp from the top of the one below it); the 1<U+00A2> and 2<U+00A2> values, however were each offered both as "vertical coils" and "horizontal coils" (stamps side-to-side separated by perforations, imperforate top and bottom). Because these coils remained in production for only a few months before the 1902 series was superseded, they stand among the great rarities of philately.  Examples of the 2<U+00A2> horizontal coil, the most common of the coils, fetch at least $2,500 U. S., and all the others are considerably more valuable, with the phenomenally scarce 1<U+00A2> vertical coil cataloguing at above $100,000.

One of the imperforate issues, the 4<U+00A2>, is also a notable rarity.  In fact, no copies of the stamp as issued survive, for all of them were incised with private "hyphen-hole" perforations by the Schermack vending machine company, and copies of these can fetch upwards of $50,000.

Note: the most detailed study of early 20th century U. S. Stamps, ''The United States Postage Stamps of the Twentieth Century'' by Beverly King and Max Johl, does not identify the engravers of the 15<U+00A2> and $1 issues.  It is reasonable to assume, however, that some or all of the six engravers who executed the other denominations--George F. C. Smillie, Marcus W. Baldwin, Robert F. Ponickau, George Rose, Lyman F. Ellis and Edward M. Weeks--also performed the engraving work on these two stamps.
