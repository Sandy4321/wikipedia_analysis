"One Time" is described to be in a "moderately slow groove".<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0140290|title=Justin Bieber- One Time|work=''Musicnotes''|publisher=[[Alfred Publishing]]|accessdate=2009-12-30}}</ref> ''[[Washington Post]]'' called the track, along with '[[Love Me (Justin Bieber song)|Love Me]]' "modest club tracks."<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/07/AR2009120703786.html?sid=ST2009120801387 Quick Spins:Reviews of albums by Justin Bieber, Clipse, and Animal Collective].

==Critical reception==
Bill Lamb of About.com called the song a "perfect kickoff to the career of Justin Bieber", said the song had an effect of a younger [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]], and commended the production of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart for making the single contemporary and commercial. However Lamb criticized the song for being too "generic", and that Bieber had little room to show his voice.<ref name="AboutArticle">{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/justinbieberonetime.htm|title= Justin Bieber- "One Time"|last=Lamb|first=Bill|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-10-20}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Michael Menachem called the song "a hallmark pop song that also taps into a prevalent teen hip-hop aesthetic". He also compared Bieber to Brown on the track, and said that "[Bieber's] tenor brings to mind [Brown's] vocal debut on "[[Run It!]]" in 2005, when he, too, was 15 and on the cusp of stardom". Unlike Lamb, Menachem said the song gave Bieber's vocals plenty of room to shine as he confidently breaks into the chorus.<ref name="BillboardArticle1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/justin-bieber-one-time-1003999823.story|title=Justin Bieber, "One Time"|last=Menachem|first=Michael|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|accessdate=2009-10-07}}</ref> Leah Greenblat of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named the song one of the hottest songs of fall of 2009, saying that Bieber's "pop-soul bonafides with this refreshingly age-appropriate chronicle of young love."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20309498,00.html|title=Fall's Hottest New Songs|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=2009-10-02|accessdate=2009-12-30}}</ref> The single was ranked the #4 song of 2009 by [[Radio Disney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7017423181?Taylor%20Swift%27s|title=Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me" Named Radio Disney's #1 Song Of 2009|publisher=AHN|date=2010-01-04|accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref>
