'''''Pioneer 10''''' (also called '''''Pioneer F''''') was the first [[spacecraft]] to travel through the [[asteroid belt]], on July 15, 1972, and to make direct observations of [[Jupiter]], which it passed by on December 3, 1973. It was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]]'s [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 36|Launch Complex 36A]] on March 2, 1972 at 01:49:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].  ''Pioneer 10'' is heading in the direction of [[Aldebaran]], located in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]].
The first artificial object set on a trajectory leading [[Outer solar system|out of the solar system]], ''Pioneer 10'' has, by some definitions, become the first to leave. However, according to the estimated trajectory, it has not yet passed the [[Heliosphere#Heliopause|heliopause]] or the [[Oort cloud]].<ref>According to NASA, the Voyager 1 spacecraft reached the termination shock on 2005-05-24 and Voyager 2 on 2007-08-30. Both had travelled at that time about 16 000 bil. km. The termination shock lies nearer to the [[Sun]] than the heliopause. Pioneer 10 has reached about 15 363 bil. km on 2008-12-01 ([http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wspace?tbody=-23&vbody=399&month=12&day=1&year=2008&hour=00&minute=00&fovmul=1&rfov=45&bfov=30&porbs=1&showsc=1 Pioneer 10 on 2008-12-01 00:00 UTC with the Solar System Simulator]). It is clear that the spacecraft has not reached the heliopause since 1 December 2008 and that nobody will ever know when it reaches it as Pioneer 10 can no longer communicate with Earth as of 2003.</ref>

Its objectives were to study the [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field|interplanetary]] and planetary [[magnetic field]]s, [[solar wind]] parameters, [[cosmic ray]]s, transition region of the [[heliosphere]], neutral hydrogen abundance, distribution, size, mass, flux, and velocity of dust particles, [[Jovian aurorae]], [[Gas giant|Jovian]] radio waves, atmosphere of Jupiter and some of its satellites (particularly [[Io (Moon)|Io]]), and to photograph Jupiter and its satellites. However, due to excess radiation from Jupiter's vicinity, the craft suffered multiple communications and instrument problems, limiting its targets.

There is no longer communication with the probe; the last contact was in 2003 and in 2006 a final attempt at contact failed.

== Construction ==

[[Image:Pioneer 10 systems diagram.svg|thumb|250px|Pioneer probe design]]Approved in 1969, ''Pioneer 10'' and its sister ship ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' were designed to live up to their names <U+2013> as first-time explorers intended to both gather data and report on conditions in the asteroid belt and in Jupiter-space. How they fared would be critical in the planning and technology of [[Voyager Program|any future missions]].<ref name="burrows">William E. Burrows, ''Exploring Space'', (New York: Random House, 1990)</ref>{{rp|266-8}}

''Pioneer 10'' was managed as part of the [[Pioneer program]] by [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and was built by [[TRW]].<ref>[http://quest.nasa.gov/sso/cool/pioneer10/mission/ NASA mission profile]</ref>  It was light, at only {{convert|260|kg|lb}} &mdash;30 and 27&nbsp;kg of which were instruments and fuel, respectively.<ref name="burrows"/>{{rp|271}} Like the [[Voyager program|Voyagers]], it was powered by [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (SNAP-19s) containing [[plutonium-238]], which provided 155W at launch, and 140W by the Jupiter flyby. The RTGs were mounted well away from the body to prevent their [[radiation]] from interfering with the spacecraft's instruments.<ref name="burrows"/>{{rp|271-2}}

<!-- This is refuted at Intel 4004. The processor was released in November 1971, only a few months before Pioneer 10 left. It would not have added weight or cost to include a stored program on the craft, and the sole point of a processor is to run a stored program.

Its central computer was based on an [[Intel 4004]] processor.<ref>{{cite web

''Pioneer 10'' was fitted with [[Pioneer plaque|a plaque]] to serve as a message for [[extraterrestrial life]], in the event of its discovery.

== Mission ==

[[Image:Atlas Centaur 27 with Pioneer 10 on launch pad.jpg|thumb|Pioneer 10 on the launch pad.]]
''Pioneer 10'' became the first spacecraft to encounter [[Jupiter]] and took color photos of the planet in December, 1973.
The spacecraft then made valuable scientific investigations in the outer regions of our [[solar system]] until the end of its mission on March 31, 1997.

== Further contact ==

''Pioneer 10'''s weak signal continued to be tracked by the [[Deep Space Network]]. After 1997 the probe was used in the training of flight controllers on how to acquire radio signals from space.  There was an [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|Advanced Concepts]] study applying [[chaos theory]] to extract coherent data.<ref>[http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast03may_1/]</ref>

The last successful reception of [[telemetry]] was on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect. Loss of contact was probably due to a combination of increasing distance and the spacecraft's steadily weakening power source, rather than structural failure of the craft.

The last, very weak signal from ''Pioneer 10'' was received on January 23, 2003, when it was 12 billion kilometers (7.5 billion miles) from Earth.<ref>"This Month in History", ''Smithsonian'' magazine, June, 2003.</ref>

A contact attempt on February 7, 2003 was unsuccessful.

One final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from ''Pioneer 10''.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000477/ The final attempt to contact ''Pioneer 10'']</ref>

''Pioneer 10'' is heading in the direction of the star [[Aldebaran]] in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] at roughly 2.6 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] per year. If Aldebaran had zero [[relative velocity]], it would take ''Pioneer 10'' about 2 million years to reach it.<ref>[http://www.heavens-above.com/solar-escape.asp Spacecraft escaping the Solar System]</ref>

* June 13, 1983 <U+2013> ''Pioneer 10'' passed the orbit of [[Neptune]], the outermost planet. (Although [[Pluto]] was considered to be a planet at the time, it was closer to the Sun than Neptune at that stage due to its highly eccentric orbit passing within that of Neptune.)
* March 1988 - passes Pluto's orbit
* March 31, 1997 <U+2013> end of mission.

* March 2, 2002 <U+2013> successful reception of telemetry. 39 minutes of clean data received from a distance of 79.83 AU.
* April 27, 2002 <U+2013> the last successful reception of telemetry. 33 minutes of clean data received from a distance of 80.22 AU.
* January 23, 2003 <U+2013> the last, very weak, signal from ''Pioneer 10'' was received. Subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect.
* February 7, 2003 <U+2013> unsuccessful contact attempt.
* December 30, 2005 <U+2013> ''Pioneer 10'' was 89.7 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]s away from the Sun, traveling at a speed of 28,000&nbsp;mph, or 12.51&nbsp;km/sec, which is 0.000041 the [[speed of light]].
* October, 2009 - speed of the spacecraft indicates it is about to reach 100 AUs from our Sun - or approx 9.3 billion miles. [http://www.unmannedspacecraft.com/index.html] Another comparison is that the nearest star, [[Multiple star|trinary]] [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri's]] [[Proxima Centauri|Proxima]] companion, is of approx 271,000 AUs distance.<ref>[http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/nearest_star_info.html]</ref>

== Pioneer anomaly ==
{{Main| Pioneer anomaly}}

Analysis of the radio tracking data from the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'' spacecraft at distances between 20<U+2013>70 AU from the Sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency drift. The drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of (8.74&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;1.33)&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;10<sup>&minus;10</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> directed towards the Sun. Although it is suspected that there is a [[Systematic bias|systematic origin]] to the effect, none has been found. As a result, there is growing interest in the nature of this anomaly.<ref>{{cite web

  | quote=The discrepancy caused by the anomaly amounts to about 248,500 miles (400,000 kilometers), or roughly the distance between Earth and the Moon. That's how much farther the probes should have traveled in their 34 years, if our understanding of gravity is correct.}}</ref>
