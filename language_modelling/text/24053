The '''Spanish conquest of Pet<U+00E9>n''' was the last stage of the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of Guatemala]], a prolonged conflict during the [[Spanish colonisation of the Americas]]. The conquest of [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department|Pet<U+00E9>n]], a densely forested lowland region now incorporated into the modern republic of [[Guatemala]], climaxed in 1697 with the capture of [[Nojpet<U+00E9>n]], the island capital of the [[Itza people|Itza]] kingdom, by [[Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a|Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi]]. Pet<U+00E9>n is a wide lowland plain that was covered with dense rainforest and that includes a central drainage basin with a series of lakes, and areas of savannah. The plain is crossed by a number of ranges of low [[karst]]ic hills and rises to the south as it nears the [[Guatemalan Highlands]]. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the [[Americas]] fell to the European colonisers.<ref name="Jones98pxix">Jones 1998, p. xix.</ref>

Sizeable [[Maya peoples|Maya]] populations existed in Pet<U+00E9>n prior to the conquest, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Pet<U+00E9>n was not politically unified and was divided into a number of different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the [[Yalain]] and the [[Kowoj]]. Other groups with territories in Pet<U+00E9>n included the Kejache, the Acala, the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]], the Xocmo, the Chinamita, the Icaiche and the Manche Ch'ol.

Pet<U+00E9>n was first penetrated by Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s with a sizeable expedition that cross the territory from north to south in 1525. In the first half of the 16th century Spain established neighbouring colonies in [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Pet<U+00E9>n from 1596 onwards but no further Spanish entry of central Pet<U+00E9>n took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of [[M<U+00E9>rida]] in Yucat<U+00E1>n. In 1628 the Manche Ch'ol of the south were placed under the administration of the colonial governor of Verapaz within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. These rebelled unsuccessfully in 1633. In 1622 a military expedition set out from Yucatan led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. In 1695 a military expedition tried to reach Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> from Guatemala; this was followed in 1697 by Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a's expedition from Yucat<U+00E1>n that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Pet<U+00E9>n and their incorporation into the Spanish Empire.

[[File:Pet<U+00E9>n savannah 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pet<U+00E9>n savannah]]
The modern [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of Pet<U+00E9>n is located in northern Guatemala; it is bordered on the east by [[Belize]], on the west by the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Chiapas]] with the border largely following the course of the [[Usumacinta River]] and on the north side by the Mexican state of [[Campeche]], with the Mexican state of [[Tabasco]] to the northwest.<ref>ITMB 1998. ITMB 2000.</ref> Pet<U+00E9>n is bordered on the south side by the Guatemalan departments of [[Alta Verapaz Department|Alta Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]].<ref>ITMB 1998.</ref>

The Pet<U+00E9>n lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying [[limestone]] plain featuring [[karstic]] topography.<ref>Lovell 2005, p. 17.</ref> The area is crossed by low east-west oriented ridges of [[Cenozoic]] limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as ''bajos''.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p46">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 46.</ref> A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin|central drainage basin]] of the Pet<U+00E9>n; during the [[rainy season]] some of these lakes become interconnected. This [[drainage area]] measures approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} east-west by {{convert|30|km|mi}} north-south.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 46<U+2013>47.</ref> The largest lake is [[Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza]], near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures {{convert|32|by|5|km|mi}}. A broad [[savanna]]h extends south of the central lakes; it features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation. This resulted in a relatively low level of [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] occupation. The savannah has an average altitude of {{convert|150|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]] with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of {{convert|300|m|ft}}. The savannah is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region ''bajos'' become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of the Pet<U+00E9>n the [[Mirador Basin]] forms another interior drainage region.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p47">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 47.</ref> To the south Pet<U+00E9>n reaches an altitude of approximately {{convert|500|m|ft}} as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets [[Paleozoic]] metamorphic rocks.<ref name="RiceRice09p5">Rice and Rice 2009, p. 5.</ref>

==Pet<U+00E9>n before the conquest==
Pet<U+00E9>n formed the heartland of the ancient [[Maya civilization]] during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic period]] ([[circa]] (or c.) AD 250<U+2013>900).<ref>Coe 1999, p. 31.

[[File:Contact Period lowland Guatemala.gif|thumb|left|350px|Map of the northern lowlands of Guatemala at the time of Spanish contact]]
Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Pet<U+00E9>n, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers.<ref>Jones 2000, p. 351.</ref> Prior to their defeat in 1697 the Itza were the most important group in Pet<U+00E9>n, controlling or influencing much of Pet<U+00E9>n and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpet<U+00E9>n, an island city upon [[Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>]]; it has developed into the modern town of [[Flores, El Pet<U+00E9>n|Flores]], which is the capital of the Pet<U+00E9>n department of Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p353">Jones 2000, p. 353.</ref> The Itza spoke a variety of [[Yucatecan languages|Yucatecan Maya]].<ref name="Jones00p352">Jones 2000, p. 352.</ref>

The second polity in importance was that of their hostile neighbours, the [[Ko'woj|Kowoj]]. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n, Lake Macanch<U+00E9>, [[Laguna Yaxh<U+00E1>|Lake Yaxh<U+00E1>]] and Lake Sacnab.<ref>Rice and Rice 2009, p. 10. Rice 2009, p. 17.</ref> Other groups are less well known and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the [[Lacandon people|Lacandon]], the [[Mopan people|Mopan]], the Manche [[Ch'ol people|Ch'ol]] and the [[Yalain]].<ref>Rice 2009, p. 17. Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref> 

The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Pet<U+00E9>n, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> eastwards to Tipuj in Belize.<ref name="Cecil99p788">Cecil et al 1999, p. 788.</ref> In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of [[Lake Macanch<U+00E9>]].<ref name="SharerTraxler2006p617">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 617.</ref> At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups.<ref name="Cecil99p788"/> In the late 17th century, Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including [[Zacpeten]] on Lake Macanch<U+00E9> and [[Ixlu]] on [[Lake Salpet<U+00E9>n]].<ref name="RiceRice05p149">Rice and Rice 2005, p. 149.</ref>

The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of the Kejache were the [[Acalan|Acala]], a [[Chontal Maya language|Chontal Maya]]-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The [[Ch'olan languages|Cholan Maya]]-speaking Lacandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning the south-western Pet<U+00E9>n in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Xocmo were another Cholan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lacandon.<ref name="Jones00p353"/> The Xocmo were never conquered and escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them; their eventual fate is unknown but they may be ancestors of the modern Lacandon people.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. 221.</ref> The Manche Ch'ol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Pet<U+00E9>n department.<ref name="Jones00p353"/> The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Rice 2009, p. 19.</ref> The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. xxi.</ref>

==Background to the conquest==
{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[Christopher Columbus]] discovered the Americas for the [[Kingdom of Castile and Leon]] in 1492. By 1580, this had unified with a number of neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. xix.</ref> In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the [[Caribbean]] and established a centre of operations on the island of [[Cuba]]. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the [[Aztec]]s on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 272.</ref> By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 276.</ref> A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying [[smallpox]] and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas.<ref>Smith 1996, 2003, p. 279.</ref> Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. The newly conquered territory became [[New Spain]], headed by a [[List of viceroys of New Spain|viceroy]] who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies.<ref>Coe and Koontz 2002, p. 229.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s despatched [[Pedro de Alvarado]] with an army to conquer the [[Mesoamerica]]n kingdoms of the Guatemalan [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541.<ref>Lovell 2005, pp. 58, 60.</ref> The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] had its capital at [[Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala]] and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as [[El Salvador]], Honduras and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>Hardoy 1991, pp. 9, 10n6.</ref> The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucat<U+00E1>n between 1527 and 1546 and over Verapaz from the 16th to 17th centurues, leaving the area between <U+2013> essentially Pet<U+00E9>n and much of Belize <U+2013> independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.<ref>Schwartz 1990, p. 33.</ref>

==Impact of Old World diseases==
The European diseases that swept through the populations of the Americas also decimated the inhabitants of Pet<U+00E9>n. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Ch'ol and [[Ch'olti' language|Ch'olti']] Maya in the western Pet<U+00E9>n at the start of the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.<ref name="Schwartz90p34"/>

When Nojpet<U+00E9>n fell in 1696 there were approximately 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, including a considerable number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of the inhabitants died during the first decade of colonial rule due to a combination of disease and war.<ref name="Jones00p364">Jones 2000, p. 364.</ref> Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, internecine warfare between rival Maya groups and Spanish expeditions also took their toll.<ref name="Jones09p60">Jones 2009, p. 60.</ref>

==Native weaponry==
{{Rquote|right|...The two [Itza] Captains bore their Lances with points of Flint, like ours, which differ from them only in being of Steel, and at the heads of them are many Plumes of divers and beautiful colors like the Ribbons our Standard-bearers use on their darts; and the points are as much as a quarter of a [[Spanish customary units|vara]] long and have two cutting-edges, and the point is like a very sharp Dagger.

The other Itzaex Indians bore their Bows and Arrows with which they always march when they come forth from their Island...in case they meet the Chinamitas, a Nation for whom they have always had enmity, and continual wars; for they hold themselves as brave warriors like the Itzas themselves.<ref>Means 1917, p. 66.</ref>|Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor, 1701<br>Book II, Chapter II, p. 92.}}
The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Pet<U+00E9>n Maya as bows and arrows, [[Fire hardening|fire-sharpened]] poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as ''hadzab'' that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]];<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 129.</ref> these were similar to the Aztec ''[[macuahuitl]]''. They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to {{convert|80|cm|in}} long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree, (''[[Apoplanesia]] paniculata''), called ''chulul'' by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were almost as high as a man and were made from the same ''chulul'' wood as the ''hadzab'', with the bowstring fashioned from [[henequen]] fibre; the bow was called a ''chuhul''.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 130.</ref> Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, pp. 130<U+2013>131.</ref> In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a ''chulul''-wood handle, they were about {{convert|20|cm|in}} long. Maya spears were referred to as ''nabte''; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were of a similar size to those used by the Spanish.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 131.</ref>

Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The upper body was covered by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt and the forearms and legs were protected with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.<ref>Rice et al. 2009, p. 132.</ref>

==Strategies and tactics==
The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'' (also known as ''congregaciones'').<ref>Rice 2009a, p. 83.</ref> Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest.<ref>Pugh 2009, p. 191.</ref>

In addtion to military expeditions, a contract for conquest was issued to the [[Dominican Order]], which engaged missionaries in an effort for the peaceful pacification of native populations, in order that they would both accept the Roman Catholic religion and submit to Spanish rule. This tactic worked in the neighouring mountains of Verapaz to the south. However, their success there was aided by the threat of Spanish garrisons stationed within striking distance. In the lowland Pet<U+00E9>n this approach was not so successful, since the Maya could disappear easily into the rainforest leaving the Spanish with nothing but deserted settlements.<ref>Feldmane 2000, p. xix.</ref>

==Cort<U+00E9>s in Pet<U+00E9>n==
[[File:Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s, Museo de Am<U+00E9>rica.jpg|thumb|left|Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s, conqueror of the Aztecs, travelled across Pet<U+00E9>n in the early 16th century.|alt=Old painting of a bearded young man facing slightly to the right.

In 1525, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Pet<U+00E9>n Department of Guatemala.<ref name="Jones00p358">Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> His aim was to subdue the rebellious [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid]], whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, but Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 761.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600 [[Chontal Maya people|Chontal Maya]] carriers from Acalan. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> on 13 March 1525.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p761762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 761<U+2013>762.</ref>

The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of [[Kan Ek'|Aj Kan Ek']], the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762.</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s accepted an invitation from Kan Ek' to visit Nojpet<U+00E9>n (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> On his departure from Nojpet<U+00E9>n, Cort<U+00E9>s left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers but the animal soon died.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. Jones 2000, p. 358.</ref> The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of [[Franciscan]] priests in 1618, when Cort<U+00E9>s' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Jones00p358" />

From the lake, Cort<U+00E9>s continued south along the western slopes of the [[Maya Mountains]], a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover {{convert|32|km|mi}}, during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cort<U+00E9>s turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762"/>

On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of [[Lake Izabal]], where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them out to safety.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762" /> Cort<U+00E9>s found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the [[Dulce River]] to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the [[Amatique Bay]],<ref name="Feldman98p6">Feldman 1998, p. 6.</ref> with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the course of the next week.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p762" /> By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cort<U+00E9>s succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Crist<U+00F3>bal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cort<U+00E9>s then returned to Mexico by sea.<ref>Webster 2002, p. 83.</ref>

==Prelude to conquest==

From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, establishing a number of colonies and towns by 1544, including [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]] and [[Valladolid, Yucat<U+00E1>n|Valladolid]] in what is now Mexico.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 358<U+2013>360.</ref> The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, within the modern borders of Guatemala.<ref>Jones 2000, pp. 360<U+2013>361.</ref> The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade routes]] over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the slow Spanish advance.<ref name="Jones00p361">Jones 2000, p. 361.</ref>

Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Pet<U+00E9>n from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the ''[[encomienda]]s''.<ref name="Jones00p361" />

===Missions in the southern Pet<U+00E9>n===
The first Catholic missionaries entered the southern Pet<U+00E9>n in 1596 to convert the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/> In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Mor<U+00E1>n as their ecclesiastical head. Mor<U+00E1>n favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north.<ref name="Feldman00pxxii"/>  The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.<ref name="Feldman00pxxii">Feldman 2000, p. xxii.</ref> The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated the Manche rebellion of Lent 1633. Throughout the 17th century Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were decimated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to [[Rabinal]] in the modern department of [[Baja Verapaz Department|Baja Verapaz]]. After 1700 the Manche Ch'ol ceased to play any part in the history of Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35">Schwartz 1990, p. 35.</ref>

The Mopan population has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people at the time of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies ordered that the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan be dealt with decisively. The population suffered the effects of war and disease and the few survivors were moved into Spanish ''reducciones'' in southeastern Pet<U+00E9>n, before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Schwartz90p35"/> The Ch'ol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] in the early 18th century.<ref name="Jones00p365">Jones 2000, p. 365.</ref>

==Conquest of the central lakes==
[[File:Laguna Yaxha.jpg|thumb|right|Lake Yaxha is surrounded by dense forest]]
Nojpet<U+00E9>n fell to a Spanish assault on 13 March 1697, just over 150 years after the conquest of the rest of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] and over 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands.<ref>Jones 1998, p. xix. Lovell 2005, p. 66. Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 618.</ref> The lengthy delay in conquering the Pet<U+00E9>n region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants.<ref name="Jones98pxix"/> During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from the Belize.<ref name="Cecil99p788"/> The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the course of the almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by territories dominated by European colonisers. This understanding of their European enemies by the Pet<U+00E9>n Maya distinguished the conquest of Pet<U+00E9>n from the earlier 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and [[Inca Empire|Incas]]. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages  whose kingdom was protected by Satan from the Christianizing efforts of the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name="Jones98pxxi">Jones 1998, p. xxi.</ref> From the time that Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s crossed the Pet<U+00E9>n in the early 16th century the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the ''Aj Kan Ek''') was the overlord of the entire central Pet<U+00E9>n region.<ref name="SharerTraxler2006p617"/>

===Early 17th century===
Following the Cort<U+00E9>s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet<U+00E9>n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from [[M<U+00E9>rida]] in Yucat<U+00E1>n on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Pet<U+00E9>n. Bartolom<U+00E9> de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773"/> Andr<U+00E9>s Carrillo de Pern<U+00ED>a, a ''[[Criollo people|Criollo]]'' who was the ''[[alcalde]]'' of [[Bacalar, Quintana Roo|Bacalar]] (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipu, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. Means 1917, pp. 61<U+2013>62, 64.</ref> After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpet<U+00E9>n for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his [[Maya religion]], although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert to Christianity. In the time since Cort<U+00E9>s had visited Nojpet<U+00E9>n, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed and the friars left Nojpet<U+00E9>n on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773.</ref>

The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed them in a friendly manner; however the [[Maya priesthood]] were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never come back.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p773"/> Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to M<U+00E9>rida.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774.</ref>

Prior to the early 17th century the western Pet<U+00E9>n had been heavily populated by Ch'ol and Ch'olti' Maya and was an important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century these populations had been decimated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza.<ref name="Schwartz90p34">Schwartz 1990, p. 34.</ref> At the same time the Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucat<U+00E1>n. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, decimated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.<ref>Schwartz 1990, pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref>

====Spanish setbacks in the 1620s====
In March 1622 Captain Francisco de Mirones set out from Yucat<U+00E1>n to launch an assault upon the Itza, with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucat<U+00E1>n.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 46.</ref> His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 42, 47.</ref> En route to Nojpet<U+00E9>n, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpet<U+00E9>n with eighty Christianised Maya from [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]] in Belize.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers after him to persuade him to return, or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipu, but he was determined to reach Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref>Means 1917, p. 79.</ref> From Tipu, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpet<U+00E9>n; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital,<ref>Means 1917, p. 80.</ref> but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals.<ref name="Means1917p81">Means 1917, p. 81.</ref> The soldiers were [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrificed]] to the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|Maya gods]], with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774, Means 1917, p. 81.</ref> After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others.<ref>Means 1917, p. 81. Jones 1998, pp. 47<U+2013>48.</ref> The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernadino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They managed to escape to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and made his way back to Mirones with the news.<ref name="Means1917p81"/>

Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza warparty led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum,<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. Jones 1998, p. 48.</ref> they were slaughtered to a man.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late; the Spanish soldiers had been hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned; Mirones had been sacrificed with his heart cut out. A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged, although not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 48.</ref>

Following these massacres, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucatan and rewards offered for the whereabouts of AjK'in P'ol. The Maya governor of [[Oxkutzcab Municipality|Oxkutzcab]], Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish captain Antonio M<U+00E9>ndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried and condemned to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]. They were decapitated and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial ''Partido de la Sierra'' in what is now Mexico's Yucatan state.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref> These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/> In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown would have neither the time, money nor interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.<ref>Feldman 2000, p. 151.</ref>

In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucat<U+00E1>n, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the [[Lacant<U+00FA>n River]] in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon.<ref name="Jones00p362"/> The governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n, [[Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi]], began to build a road from Campeche south towards Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p774"/>


====D<U+00ED>az de Velasco and Cano's entry from Verapaz====
In March 1695, captain Juan D<U+00ED>az de Velasco set out from [[Cahab<U+00F3>n]] in [[Alta Verapaz]] with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by ''Criollo'' friar Agust<U+00ED>n Cano accompanied the expedition.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 132, 134. Means 1917, p. 97.</ref> The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of president [[Jacinto de Barrios Leal]], were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a could reach them from Yucat<U+00E1>n; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucat<U+00E1>n.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 133.</ref> The expedition proceeded northwards through Ch'ol territory and into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern [[San Luis, El Pet<U+00E9>n|San Luis]]). Due to their fear of their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Ch'ol and the Mopans claimed not to know of any paths to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Jones 1998, p. 134.</ref> The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions amongst their native carriers. The Dominicans took advantage of the delay in order to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four ''[[cacique]]s'' (native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.<ref name="Jones1998p135">Jones 1998, p. 135.</ref>

The Spanish believed that by pressing ahead to Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> they would link up with a simultaneous expedition headed by president Barrios himself, unaware that the Barrios had not reached the region. D<U+00ED>az de Velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 April. They soon found evidence of recent Itza camps in the area, estimated to be a month old. The scouts found a clear road heading north to the Itza kingdom and the army set off along it. The main force camped about ten leagues south of the lake while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead; this consisted of 2 Spanish soldiers, 2 archers and 2 muleteers from Verapaz, with 2 Ch'ol-speaking native interpreters.<ref name="Jones1998p135"/>

====Avenda<U+00F1>o's entry from Yucat<U+00E1>n====
Franciscan Andr<U+00E9>s de Avenda<U+00F1>o followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpet<U+00E9>n with local Maya guides.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 774<U+2013>775.</ref> They arrived at the western end of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors. The Franciscans returned to Nojpet<U+00E9>n with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda<U+00F1>o tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p775"/> The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrical cycle]] beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord.<ref name="Jones00p362"/> The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by a rival Itza group to ambush and kill the Franciscans and the Itza king advised them to return to M<U+00E9>rida via Tipu.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p775">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775.</ref> The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships but eventually arrived back in M<U+00E9>rida after a month travelling.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 775<U+2013>776.</ref>

Kan Ek' sent emissaries to M<U+00E9>rida in December 1695 to inform Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. A Spanish party led by Captain Pedro de Zubiaur arrived at Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itza with 60 soldiers, friar San Buenaventura and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. Although they expected a peaceful welcome they were immediately attacked by approximately 2000 Maya warriors. San Buenaventura and one of his Franciscan companions, a Spanish soldier and a number of Yucatec Maya warriors were taken prisoner. Spanish reinforcements arrived the next day but were beaten back. This turn of events convinced Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p776">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776.</ref>

===Fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n===
The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpet<U+00E9>n once and for all.<ref name="Jones00p362">Jones 2000, p. 362.</ref> The final assault was made possible by the gradual opening of a road from M<U+00E9>rida to Pet<U+00E9>n.<ref name="Fialko03p72">Fialko 2003, p. 72.</ref> Mart<U+00ED>n de Urz<U+00FA>a y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> with his soldiers in February 1697, and once there built a ''galeota'', a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat.<ref name="Jones09p59">Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> On 10 March Kan Ek' sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Urs<U+00FA>a received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. Urs<U+00FA>a decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on 13 March.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p777">Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777.</ref> The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island;<ref name="Jones09p59" /> The surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 777<U+2013>778.</ref> After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town.<ref name="Jones00p362" /> Mart<U+00ED>n de Urs<U+00FA>a planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpet<U+00E9>n as ''Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza'' ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza").<ref>Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 778. Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> Kan Ek' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler;<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 206">Jones 1998, p. 206.</ref> The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpet<U+00E9>n safely in the hands of the Spanish, Urs<U+00FA>a returned to M<U+00E9>rida, leaving Kan Ek' and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (modern [[Antigua Guatemala]]), accompanied by mixed-race ''[[ladino people|ladino]]'' civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital.<ref name="Jones09p59" />

When the Spanish conquered the Pet<U+00E9>n lakes in 1697, the Yalain were initially cooperative and assisted in the capture of the king of the Itza. At this time Yalain was ruled by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain leadership encouraged Christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with the occupying Spanish forces. As time went on, Yalain cooperation with the Spanish appears to have decreased.<ref name="Jones 1998, p. 206"/> Soon after the conquest, the Yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging Spanish parties that were abducting Maya women for "service" at their barracks. At this time, such was the hostility that was felt towards the occupying forces that the inhabitants of the Yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave anything for the Spanish.<ref>Jones 1998, pp. 367<U+2013>368.</ref> The Yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698.<ref name="Rice&c97p550">Rice et al 1997, p. 550.</ref>

In the late 17th century the small population of Ch'ol Maya in southern Pet<U+00E9>n and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q'eqchi' population.<ref name="Jones00p365"/> After the conquest, the colonial administration of Pet<U+00E9>n was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucat<U+00E1>n and secular administration as part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was never a strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the [[Castillo de Arismendi]]; it was finished in 1700.<ref>Arrivillaga Cort<U+00E9>s 1998, p. 53.</ref> The distance from Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpet<U+00E9>n) to M<U+00E9>rida, combined with the difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucat<U+00E1>n falling into a state of disrepair.<ref name="Fialko03p72"/> In 1701 Urs<U+00FA>a y Arezmendi realised that the road was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucat<U+00E1>n.

Catholic priests from Yucat<U+00E1>n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> in 1702<U+2013>1703.<ref name="Jones09p59">Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> The first towns to be concentrated into colonial ''reducciones'' were Ixtutz, which became the new town of [[San Jos<U+00E9>, El Pet<U+00E9>n|San Jos<U+00E9>]], and neighbouring San Andr<U+00E9>s, both on the north shore of Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>.<ref>Fialko 2003, p. 73. ITMB 1998.</ref> They were first subjugated by one of Urs<U+00FA>a's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants.<ref name="Fialko03p73"/> Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpet<U+00E9>n,<ref>Jones 1998, p. xxi. Jones 2009, p. 59.</ref> but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet<U+00E9>n, compared to ten times that number in 1697.<ref name="Jones09p59" /> The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the [[Itza language]].<ref name="Fialko03p73"/>

At the time of the fall of Nojpet<U+00E9>n, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Pet<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1>, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.<ref name="Jones00[364">Jones 2000, p. 364.</ref> Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.<ref name="Jones09p60">Jones 2009, p. 60.</ref>
