{{Mitt Romney series}}
The '''business career of [[Mitt Romney]]''' began shortly after he finished graduate school in 1975.  At that time, he entered the [[management consulting]] industry, and in 1977 secured a position at [[Bain & Company]]. Later serving as its chief executive officer, he helped bring the company out of financial crisis<!-- this is supported by detailed sources in body of article -->. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off [[Bain Capital]], a [[private equity]] investment firm that became highly profitable and one of the [[List of private equity firms#Largest private equity firms|largest such firms]] in the nation<!-- this is supported by detailed sources in body of article -->. The fortune he earned from his business career is estimated at $190<U+2013>250&nbsp;million.

==Entry into management consulting at Boston Consulting Group: 1975-1977==
[[Image:The Boston Consulting Group logo.png|thumb|left|400px|Logo of Boston Consulting Group]]After he received a [[JD/MBA|joint]] [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1975, Mitt Romney was recruited by several firms and chose to remain in Massachusetts to work for [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG), reasoning that working as a [[management consultant]] to a variety of companies would better prepare him for a future position as a chief executive.<ref name="bgseries3"/><ref name="MrPowerPoint"/><ref>Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', p. 97.</ref> He was part of a 1970s wave of top graduates who chose to go into consulting rather than join a major company directly.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/sunday-review/consultant-nation.html | title=Consultant Nation | author=[[David Leonhardt|Leonhardt, David]] | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 11, 2011}}</ref> 

Romney had his pick of jobs at the nation<U+2019>s biggest and most prestigious consulting firms, and at that time BCG was neither. Its brilliant and idiosyncratic founder, [[Bruce Henderson]], was regarded as outside the mainstream of corporate consulting, and BCG was routinely disparaged by faculty and students at Harvard Business School.<ref name=Barbaro />  But BCG was a pioneering upstart that fostered camaraderie among its employees, who traveled around the country to advise clients, and that is where Mitt Romney chose to start his career.<ref name=Barbaro>Michael Barbaro.

[[File:Staples Savi Ranch.jpg|thumb|right|x200px|Staples store in [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda, CA]]]]While Bain Capital was founded by Bain executives, the firm was not an affiliate or a division of Bain & Company but rather a completely separate company.  Initially, the two firms shared the same offices - in an office tower at [[Copley Place]] in Boston<ref>Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', p. 133.</ref> - and a similar approach to improving business operations. However, the two firms had put in place certain protections to avoid sharing information between the two companies and the Bain & Company executives had the ability to veto investments that posed potential conflicts of interest.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/22/business/big-consultants-woo-employees-by-offering-a-piece-of-the-action.html Big Consultants Woo Employees by Offering a Piece of the Action].

Bain Capital's original $37 million fund was raised entirely from private individuals in mid-1984.<ref name=bain_fundinguniverse />  The firm initially gave a cut of its profits to Bain & Company, but Romney later persuaded Bill Bain to give that up.<ref name="nyt060407db">{{Cite news| url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/romneys-presidential-run-throws-spotlight-on-bain-capital/ | title=Romney's Presidential Run Puts Spotlight on Bain Capital | author=Sorkin, Andrew Ross | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 4, 2007 | authorlink=Andrew Ross Sorkin}}</ref> 

The Bain Capital team was initially reluctant to invest its capital.  By 1985, things were going poorly enough that Romney considered closing the operation, returning investors' money back to them, and having the partners go back to their old positions.<ref>Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', p. 138.</ref>  The partners saw weak spots in so many potential deals that by 1986, very few had been done.<ref name="bgseries3">{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/specials/romney/articles/part3_main/ | title=The Making of Mitt Romney: Part 3: Reaping profit in study, sweat | author=Gavin, Robert | author2=Pfeiffer, Sacha | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> At first, Bain Capital focused on [[venture capital]] opportunities.<ref name="bgseries3"/>  One of Bain's earliest and most notable venture investments was in [[Staples, Inc.]], the [[office supply]] [[retailer]].

Bain invested the $37 million of capital in its first fund in twenty companies and by 1989 was generating an annualized return in excess of 50 percent.

Bringing along two lieutenants from Bain Capital, Romney began a traveling campaign to rally employees at all Bain offices globally.

Some of the techniques that Romney employed during this temporary mission at Bain & Company were as follows: at the outset, he demanded unanimous approval from the partners at Bain & Company for his designation as CEO, and also demanded that each partner commit to staying at least a year so as to give the turnaround a fair chance.  He limited partner meetings to Saturdays, so that all of the weekdays could be devoted to taking care of client business.  Romney reduced the company's physical space, evaluated which partners were producing and which were not, arranged bridge financing, and focused on hiring top talent from top schools, while rescinding prior offers that were not up to standard.<ref name=things /> 

Although in the role for just one year before returning to Bain Capital, Romney's work had three profound impacts on the firm. First, ownership was officially shifted from the owners to the firm's 70 [[Partner (business rank)|general partners]]. Second, transparency in the firm's finances increased dramatically (e.g. partners were able to know each other's salaries<ref name="american.com" />). Third, Bill Bain relinquished ownership in the firm that carried his name.
Within a year, Bain bounced back to profitability without major partner defections,<ref name="american.com" /> and the groundwork was laid for a period of steady growth.

==Back at Bain Capital for the rest of the 1990s==
[[Image:Brookstone Outlet Store, Kittery ME.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An outlet store in [[Kittery, Maine]]]]After Romney and Bain took over [[Brookstone]] in 1991, they replaced Brookstone's CEO in 1993, shifted to more Brookstone-branded items, moved more catalog content onto the company's website in 1996, and, instead of selling gifts began offering more practical items.  Brookstone survived while its competitor, [[Sharper Image]], declared bankruptcy. 

In July 1992 (while Romney was still rescuing Bain & Company), Bain Capital acquired [[Ampad]] from [[Mead Corporation]], which had acquired the company in 1986.  Mead, which was experiencing difficulties integrating Ampad's products into its existing product lines, generated a cash gain of $56 million on the sale.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/03/business/company-news-mead-corp-to-lay-off-1000.html Mead Corp. to Lay Off 1,000].
