'''Niobium''', formerly '''columbium''', is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Nb''' (formerly '''Cb''') and [[atomic number]] 41. It is a soft, grey, [[ductile]] [[transition metal]], which is often found in the [[pyrochlore]] mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and [[columbite]]. The name comes from [[Greek mythology]]: ''[[Niobe]]'', daughter of ''[[Tantalus]]''.

Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element [[tantalum]], and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemist [[Charles Hatchett]] reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]] wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist [[Heinrich Rose]] determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. [[Brazil]] is the leading producer of niobium and [[ferroniobium]], an [[alloy]] of niobium and iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special [[steel]] such as that used in gas [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]]. Although alloys contain only a maximum of 0.1%, that small percentage of niobium improves the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing [[superalloy]]s is important for its use in [[jet engine|jet]] and [[rocket engine]]s. Niobium is used in various [[Superconductivity|superconducting]] materials. These [[Type-II superconductor|superconducting alloys]], also containing [[titanium]] and [[tin]], are widely used in the [[superconducting magnet]]s of [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanners]]. Other applications of niobium include its use in welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, numismatics and jewelry. In the last two applications, niobium's low toxicity and ability to be colored by [[Anodizing|anodization]] are particular advantages.

===Physical===
Niobium is a [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustrous]], grey, [[ductility|ductile]], [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[metal]] in [[Group 5 element|group 5]] of the [[periodic table]] (see table), although it has an atypical configuration in its outermost [[electron shell]]s compared to the rest of the members.

:Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 10 HF <U+2192> 2 H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O

The first industrial scale separation, developed by [[Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac|de Marignac]], exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum [[fluoride]]s, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki><U+00B7>H<sub>2</sub>O) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>TaF<sub>7</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki>) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from [[aqueous]] solution by [[organic solvents]] like [[cyclohexanone]].<ref name="ICE" /> The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the [[organic solvent]] with water and either precipitated by the addition of [[potassium fluoride]] to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with [[ammonia]] as the pentoxide:<ref name="HollemanAF" />

:H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 2 KF <U+2192> K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki><U+2193> + 2 HF

Followed by:
:2 H<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> + 10 NH<sub>4</sub>OH <U+2192> Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><U+2193> + 10 NH<sub>4</sub>F + 7 H<sub>2</sub>O

Several methods are used for the [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] to metallic niobium. The [[electrolysis]] of a molten mixture of K<sub>2</sub><nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<sub>5</sub><nowiki>]</nowiki> and [[sodium chloride]] is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with [[sodium]]. With this method niobium with a relatively high purity can be obtained. In large scale production the reduction of Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with hydrogen or carbon<ref name="HollemanAF" /> is used. In the process involving the [[aluminothermic reaction]] a mixture of [[iron oxide]] and niobium oxide is reacted with [[aluminium]]:
:3 Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 12 Al <U+2192> 6 Nb + 2 Fe + 6 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

To enhance the reaction, small amounts of oxidizers like [[sodium nitrate]] are added. The result is [[aluminium oxide]] and [[ferroniobium]], an alloy of iron and niobium used in the steel production.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Progress in Niobium Markets and Technology 1981<U+2013>2001|author = Tither, Geoffrey|url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/images/pdfs/oppening.pdf|journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = The Production of Ferroniobium at the Niobec mine 1981<U+2013>2001|first = Claude|last = Dufresne|coauthor = Goyette, Ghislain| url = http://www.cbmm.com.br/portug/sources/techlib/science_techno/table_content/sub_1/images/pdfs/start.pdf|accessdate =|journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals|format = PDF}}</ref> The ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% of niobium.<ref name="tesla" /> Without addition of iron oxide, aluminothermic process is used for the production of niobium.

==Compounds==
{{see also|Category:Niobium compounds}}
Niobium is in many ways similar to [[tantalum]] and [[zirconium]]. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures: niobium reacts with [[fluorine]] at room temperature, with [[chlorine]] and [[hydrogen]] at 200&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]], and with [[nitrogen]] at 400&nbsp;<U+00B0>C, giving products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric.<ref name="Nowak" /> The metal begins to [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air at 200&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]],<ref name="HollemanAF">{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91<U+2013>100|pages = 1075<U+2013>1079|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|chapter = Niob| language = German}}</ref> and is resistant to corrosion by fused [[alkali metal|alkalis]] and by acids, including [[aqua regia]], [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]], [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[phosphoric acid]]s.<ref name="Nowak" /> Niobium is attacked by [[hydrofluoric acid]] and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.

Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from +5 to <U+2212>1, in most commonly encountered compounds, it is found in the +5 state.<ref name="Nowak" /> Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb<U+2013>Nb bonding.

===Oxides and sulfides===
Niobium forms [[oxide]]s with the [[oxidation state]]s +5 ([[Niobium pentoxide|Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]]), +4 ([[Niobium dioxide|NbO<sub>2</sub>]]), and +3 (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>),<ref name="HollemanAF" /> as well as with the rarer oxidation state +2 ([[niobium monoxide|NbO]]).<ref>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref> Most commonly encountered is the pentoxide, precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys.<ref name="HollemanAF" /><ref name="Cardarelli">{{cite book|first = Francois|last = Cardarelli|year = 2008|title = Materials Handbook |publisher = Springer London|isbn = 978-1-84628-668-1}}</ref> Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[hydroxide]] solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides.

In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite]]-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone {{chem|NbO|4|3-}} ions.<ref name="HollemanAF" /> The layered niobium sulfide (NbS<sub>2</sub>) is also known.<ref name="Nowak" />

Materials with a thin film coating of niobium(V) oxide can be produced by [[chemical vapor deposition]] or [[atomic layer deposition]] processes, in each case by the thermal decomposition of [[niobium(V) ethoxide]] above 350&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref>{{cite thesis | title = Atomic Layer Deposition of High Permittivity Oxides: Film Growth and In Situ Studies |  author = Rahtu, Antti | publisher = University of Helsinki | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10138/21065 | year = 2002 | isbn = 952-10-0646-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi =  10.1149/1.2059247 | title =  Electrochromic Properties of Niobium Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Chemical Vapor Deposition | year =  1994 | last1 =  Maruyama | first1 =  Toshiro | journal =  Journal of the Electrochemical Society | volume =  141 | issue =  10 | pages =  2868}}</ref>

The high sensitivity of superconducting niobium nitride [[Microbolometer|bolometers]] make them an ideal detector for [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the THz frequency band. These detectors were tested at the [[Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope]], the [[South Pole Telescope]], the [[Receiver Lab Telescope]], and at [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment|APEX]] and are now used in the HIFI instrument on board the [[Herschel Space Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Review of Scientific Instruments|volume = 79|year = 2008|pages = 0345011<U+2013>03451010|doi = 10.1063/1.2890099|title = A Hot-electron bolometer terahertz mixers for the Herschel Space Observatory|first = Sergey|last = Cherednichenko|coauthors = Drakinskiy, Vladimir; Berg, Therese; Khosropanah, Pourya; Kollberg, Erik|pmid = 18377032|issue = 3|bibcode = 2008RScI...79c4501C }}</ref>

===Other uses===

====Electroceramics====
[[Lithium niobate]], which is a [[ferroelectric]], is used extensively in mobile telephones and [[optical modulators]], and for the manufacture of [[surface acoustic wave]] devices. It belongs to the [[Perovskite|ABO<sub>3</sub>]] structure ferroelectrics like [[lithium tantalate]] and [[barium titanate]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Lithium Niobate: Defects, Photorefraction and Ferroelectric Switching|first = Tatyana|last = Volk|coauthors = Wohlecke, Manfred|publisher = Springer|year = 2008|isbn = 978-3-540-70765-3|pages = 1<U+2013>9}}</ref> Niobium was evaluated as a cheaper alternative to tantalum in [[Tantalum capacitor|capacitors]],<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Quality and Reliability Engineering International|volume = 14|issue = 2|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1638(199803/04)14:2<79::AID-QRE163>3.0.CO;2-Y|pages = 79<U+2013>82|year = 1991 |title = Reliability comparison of tantalum and niobium solid electrolytic capacitors|first = Y.|last = Pozdeev}}</ref> but tantalum capacitors are still predominant. Niobium is added to glass in order to attain a higher [[refractive index]], a property of use to the optical industry in making thinner [[glasses|corrective glasses]].

====Hypoallergenic applications: medicine and jewelry====
Niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and thus [[hypoallergenic]]. For this reason, niobium is found in many medical devices such as pacemakers.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Mallela| first = Venkateswara Sarma|coauthors = Ilankumaran, V.; Srinivasa Rao, N.| title = Trends in Cardiac Pacemaker Batteries|journal = Indian Pacing Electrophysiol J.|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 201<U+2013>212|date=1 January 2004|pmid = 16943934|pmc = 1502062}}</ref> Niobium treated with [[sodium hydroxide]] forms a porous layer that aids [[osseointegration]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Godley|first = Reut|coauthors = Starosvetsky, David; Gotman, Irena|year = 2004|title = Bonelike apatite formation on niobium metal treated in aqueous NaOH|journal = Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine|volume = 15|pages = 1073<U+2013>1077|doi = 10.1023/B:JMSM.0000046388.07961.81|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/l5613670648017wp/|format = PDF|pmid = 15516867|issue = 10}}</ref>

Along with titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, niobium can also be electrically heated and [[anodize]]d, resulting in a wide array of colours using a process known as reactive metal [[anodizing]] which is useful in making jewelry.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Applied Electrochemistry|volume = 21|issue = 11|doi = 10.1007/BF01077589|pages = 1023<U+2013>1026 |year = 1991|title = Anodization of niobium in sulphuric acid media|first = M.

Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, [[Austria]] produced a series of silver niobium [[euro]] coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the [[diffraction]] of light by a thin oxide layer produced by [[anodising]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.ijrmhm.2005.10.008|journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials|volume = 24|issue = 4|year = 2006|pages = 275<U+2013>282|title = Niobium as mint metal: Production<U+2013>properties<U+2013>processing|first =Robert|last = Grill|coauthors = Gnadenberge, Alfred}}</ref> In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow.

in which the niobium was selectively oxidized, thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike.

====Other====
The arc-tube seals of high pressure [[sodium vapor lamp]]s are made from niobium, or niobium with 1% of [[zirconium]], because niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion to the [[sintered]] [[alumina]] [[arc tube]] ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or [[redox|reduction]] by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp.<ref>{{cite book|title = Lamps and Lighting|first = Stanley Thomas|last = Henderson|coauthors = Marsden, Alfred Michael; Hewitt, Harry|publisher = Edward Arnold Press|year = 1972|isbn = 0-7131-3267-1|pages = 244<U+2013>245}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Refractory metals: crucial components for light sources|last = Eichelbr<U+00F6>nner|first = G.|year =1998|journal = International Journal of Refractory Metals and Hard Materials|volume = 16|issue = 1|pages = 5<U+2013>11|doi = 10.1016/S0263-4368(98)00009-2|accessdate =}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = Niobium and Niobium 1% Zirconium for High Pressure Sodium (HPS) Discharge Lamps|first = Christopher A.|last = Michaluk|coauthors = Huber, Louis E.; Ford, Robert B.| journal = Niobium Science & Technology: Proceedings of the International Symposium Niobium 2001 (Orlando, Florida, USA)|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-9712068-0-9 |publisher = Niobium 2001 Ltd, 2002|editor=Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Metals and Materials Society Minerals}}</ref> The metal is also used in [[arc welding]] rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel.<ref>{{US patent reference|number = 5254836|y = 1993|m = 10|d = 19|inventor = Okada, Yuuji; Kobayashi, Toshihiko; Sasabe, Hiroshi; Aoki, Yoshimitsu; Nishizawa, Makoto; Endo, Shunji|title = Method of arc welding with a ferrite stainless steel welding rod}}</ref><!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jxmetals.com/sdp/316680/4/cp-1271725.html|publisher=Shanghai Jiangxi Metals Co.

==Precautions==
Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.<ref>{{cite journal|title = New trends in the use of metals in jewellery|first = J.|last = Vilaplana|coauthors = Romaguera, C.; Grimalt, F.; Cornellana, F.|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 25|issue = 3 |pages = 145<U+2013>148|year = 1990|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1991.tb01819.x|pmid = 1782765}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = New developments in jewellery and dental materials|first = J.|last = Vilaplana|coauthors = Romaguera, C.| journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 39|issue = 2| pages = 55<U+2013>57|year = 1998|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0536.1998.tb05832.x|pmid = 9746182}}</ref>

Niobium-containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short and long term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a [[median lethal dose]] (LD<sub>50</sub>) between 10 and 100&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="Haley">{{cite journal|title = Pharmacology and toxicology of niobium chloride|first = Thomas J.|last = Haley|coauthor = Komesu, N.; Raymond, K.|journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]]|volume = 4|issue = 3|pages = 385<U+2013>392|year = 1962|doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(62)90048-0|pmid=13903824}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title = The Toxicity of Niobium Salts |first = William L.|last = Downs|coauthors = Scott, James K.; Yuile, Charles L.; Caruso, Frank S.; Wong, Lawrence C.
