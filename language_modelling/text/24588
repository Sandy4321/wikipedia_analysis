'''''Orchestral Works by Tomas Svoboda''''' (sometimes abridged as '''''Orchestral Works''''') is a classical music album by the [[Oregon Symphony]] under the [[Artistic director|artistic direction]] of [[James DePreist]], released by the record label [[Albany Records|Albany]] in 2003. The album was recorded at the [[Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] during three performances in January and June 2000. It contains three works by [[Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Svoboda (composer)|Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Svoboda]], a Czech-American composer who taught at [[Portland State University]] for more than 25 years: ''Overture of the Season'', Op. 89; ''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'', Op. 148; and Symphony No. 1 (of Nature), Op. 20. The album's [[executive producer]]s were Peter Kermani, Susan Bush, and Mark B. Rulison; [[Blanton Alspaugh]] served as the [[Record producer|recording producer]].

''Overture of the Season'' and ''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'' were commissioned by the Oregon Symphony. The latter was dedicated to principal percussionist Niel DePonte, who encouraged Svoboda to compose the work and who is featured on [[marimba]]; it was the first [[concerto]] commissioned by the orchestra for one of its musicians. Though the album received a mixed critical reception, DePonte's performance earned him a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra)|Best Instrumental Soloist Performance with Orchestra]]. Selected tracks from the album have been broadcast by classical music radio stations throughout the United States.

[[File:Marimba detail (2931259387).jpg|thumb|right|''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'', commissioned by the Oregon Symphony, features Niel DePonte on [[marimba]] (pictured).]]

''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'' was commissioned by the orchestra in 1993 in conjunction with its centennial celebration. It features solo marimba and a "[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]" quintet ([[piano]], [[harp]], [[Celesta|celeste]], [[Glockenspiel|orchestra bells]] and [[crotales]]), with parts for flutes, piccolo, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.<ref name=Liner/> According to Svoboda, the work took a year to compose and marks the first [[concerto]] commissioned by the Oregon Symphony for one of its musicians. ''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'' is dedicated to DePonte, who encouraged Svoboda to compose a marimba concerto.<ref name=Liner/> For the album's liner notes, Svoboda wrote:

{{Quote|"My approach to this work is to expose the beauty of the marimba. The gentle and majestic sounds found in the instrumental mixture within the orchestra is always respectful of the somewhat limited powers of projection of the solo instrument. Overall the concerto is stylistically lyrical and neo-romantic. The energy and vitality of the marimba is highlighted through the rhythmic vitality of the composition, while marimba's warm and resonant sound, emanating from its rosewood keyboard, is ideally suited for the lyrical sections of the piece."<ref name=Liner/>}}

When the concerto is performed, according to Svoboda, instruments on stage are separated into three contrasting sections: the solo marimba, the quintet, and the remainder of the orchestra. The quintet is placed near the conductor and solo marimba, "which is the prominent voice of this uncommon ensemble".<ref name=Liner/> The composition contains several instances where the quintet plays for extended periods, referred to as "islands" by Svoboda, which create "concerto grosso-like interplay" with the orchestra.<ref name=Liner/>

Symphony No. 1 was completed in 1956 and premiered in [[Prague]] on September 7, 1957. Inspired by Svoboda's exposure to nature within a pastoral setting, the composition was commissioned anonymously 25 years later (1982), providing Svoboda an opportunity to make revisions.<ref name=Liner/> The work was influenced by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]], and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]; it features [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] textures and [[Additive rhythm and divisive rhythm|asymmetrical]] and [[harmonic rhythm]]ic elements. The symphony consists of four movements: "Moderato", "Presto", "Andante", and "Allegro <U+2013> Moderato". The first, considered a [[chorale]], is in the key of [[C-sharp minor]] and features a theme performed by flute. The second movement, a [[scherzo]], features a "quick, motoric" triple rhythm and [[Meter (music)|meter]].<ref name=Liner/> The third is a [[pastorale]] that highlights the [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]] section and incorporates a piece called "The Bird", composed by Svoboda in 1949 at age nine. The final movement, a [[rondo]], was influenced by [[Music of the Czech Republic|Czech folk music]] and mixes themes supplied by earlier movements.<ref name=Liner/>

==Reception and broadcasts==
[[Image:Bush DePriest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Oregon Symphony]] was [[Conducting|conducted]] by [[James DePreist]], pictured in 2005 with President [[George W. Bush]] after receiving the [[National Medal of Arts]].]]

The album received a mixed reception. Blair Sanderson of [[AllMusic]] found Svoboda's compositions to be imitative, specifically comparing ''Over of the Season'' to work by [[Leo<U+0161> Jan<U+00E1><U+010D>ek]] and Symphony No. 1 to "equal parts" of [[Hugo Alfv<U+00E9>n]] and [[Jean Sibelius]], with "just a dash" of [[Carl Nielsen]].<ref name=AllMusic/> Sanderson criticized the harmonic language of ''Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra'' and found DePonte's performance to be admirable but "weakly planned".<ref name=AllMusic/> Similarly, Robert Dettmer of ''Classical CD Review'' found Svoboda's work to be derivative and "expressively sterile", and "no more engaging than any other marimba concerto".<ref name=Review>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicalcdreview.com/svoboda.html|title=Review: Svoboda: Overture of the Season, Op. 89. Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra, Op. 148. Symphony No. 1, Op. 20 (Of Nature).|work=''Classical CD Review''|accessdate=January 29, 2014|date=September 2003|first=Roger|last=Dettmer}}</ref> However, Dettmer acknowledged that the marimba was one of his least favorite solo instruments. Dettmer wrote that DePriest "serves the composer dutifully, but not as enliveningly as one might have expected".<ref name=Review/>

For his marimba performance, DePonte earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra)|Best Instrumental Soloist Performance with Orchestra]],<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://variety.com/2003/music/news/grammy-list-ii-1117896594/|title=Grammy list II|accessdate=January 27, 2014|date=December 4, 2003|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]]|issn=0042-2738|oclc=810134503}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-2747-wws_teen_on_the_scene_at_s_k.html|title=WW's Teen on the Scene at S-K|accessdate=January 27, 2014|date=December 17, 2003|work=[[Willamette Week]]|publisher=City of Roses Newspapers|location=Portland, Oregon}}</ref> the first time that the Oregon Symphony or any of its musicians had been recognized by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|Recording Academy]].<ref name=Grammy/> Following the announcement, DePonte admitted that he was surprised by the nomination and had not felt similar emotions since learning of his invitation to join the orchestra 26 years earlier:<ref name=Eugene/> "I am completely overwhelmed. I had no idea the recording had been submitted."<ref name=Grammy/> DePriest said: "The credit goes to Mary Tooze for making the recording possible, to Niel for his fine playing and to Tomas for writing such a wonderful piece. I am thrilled for everyone concerned."<ref name=Eugene/> Svoboda said of the nomination: "The prestige goes to the orchestra. This is a great moment for our symphony."<ref name=Grammy/> The Oregon Symphony's director of public relations commented: "The running joke is that forever more, the name of this organization is 'The Grammy-nominated Oregon Symphony Orchestra.' The Grammy acknowledgment is recognized as a mark of great artistic achievement. To be nominated is about as good as it gets."<ref name=Grammy/>
