The '''Second Chechen War''' was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] by the [[Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade]] (IIPB).

On 1 October Russian troops entered [[Chechnya]].<ref name="sakwa_chechnya">{{Cite book|last=Sakwa|first=Richard|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|year=2005|edition=1st|pages=1<U+2013>42|chapter=Introduction: Why Chechnya?|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5|accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref><ref name="mdb_chechnya"/> The campaign ended the de facto independence of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] and restored Russian federal control over the territory. Although it is regarded by many as an internal conflict within the Russian Federation, the war attracted a large number of foreign fighters.

During the initial campaign, [[Russians|Russian]] military and pro-Russian [[Chechens|Chechen]] paramilitary forces faced Chechen separatists in open combat, and seized the Chechen capital [[Grozny]] after a winter [[siege]] that lasted from late 1999 to the following February 2000. Russia established direct rule of Chechnya in May 2000 and after the full-scale [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], Chechen militant [[Resistance movement|resistance]] throughout the [[North Caucasus]] region continued to inflict heavy Russian casualties and challenge Russian political control over Chechnya for several more years. Some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. [[Second Chechen War crimes and terrorism|These attacks]], as well as widespread human rights violations by Russian and separatist forces, drew international condemnation.

As of 2009, Russia has severely disabled the Chechen separatist movement and large-scale fighting has ceased. Russian army and interior ministry troops no longer occupy the streets. The once-leveled city of Grozny has recently undergone massive reconstruction efforts and much of the city and surrounding areas have been rebuilt at a quick pace. However sporadic violence still exists throughout the North Caucasus; occasional bombings and ambushes targeting federal troops and forces of the regional governments in the area still occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|title=CIA <U+2013> The World Factbook <U+2013> Russia|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/russia.chechnya It's over, and Putin won] [[The Guardian]] Retrieved on 23 February 2009</ref>

==Historical basis of the conflict==
{{Main|History of Chechnya}}

===Russian Empire===
{{Main|Caucasian War}}

[[File:Chechnya and Caucasus.png|thumb|right|300px|Chechnya and the Caucasus region]]

Chechnya is a region in the Northern Caucasus which has constantly fought against foreign rule, including the [[Ottoman Turks]] in the 15th century. The Russian [[Terek Cossack Host]] was established in lowland Chechnya in 1577 by free [[Cossacks]] who were resettled from the [[Volga]] to the [[Terek River]]. In 1783 Russia and the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] kingdom of [[Kartl-Kakheti]] signed the [[Treaty of Georgievsk]], under which Kartl-Kakheti became a Russian protectorate. To secure communications with Georgia and other regions of the [[Transcaucasia]], the [[Russian Empire]] began spreading its influence into the Caucasus region, starting the [[Caucasus War]] in 1817. Russian forces first moved into [[Highland (geography)|highland]] Chechnya in 1830, and the conflict in the area lasted until 1859, when a 250,000 strong army under [[Aleksandr Baryatinsky|General Baryatinsky]] broke down the mountaineers' resistance. However, frequent uprisings in the Caucasus also occurred during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78]].

===Soviet Union===
Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Chechens established a short-lived [[Caucasian Imamate]] which included parts of Chechnya, [[Dagestan]] and [[Ingushetia]]; there was also secular pan-Caucasian [[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]].<ref>Armstrong, Patrick.

ISBN 0-7146-4992-9.</ref> The Chechen states were opposed{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} by both sides of the [[Russian Civil War]] and most of the resistance was crushed by [[Bolshevik]] troops by 1922. Then, months before the creation of the [[Soviet Union]], the Chechen [[Autonomous Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]] was established. It annexed a part of territory of the former [[Terek Cossack Host]]. Chechnya and neighbouring Ingushetia formed the [[Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1936. In 1941, during World War II, a Chechen [[1940-1944 Chechnya insurgency|revolt]] broke out, led by [[Khasan Israilov]]. Chechens were accused by [[Joseph Stalin]] of aiding [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces. In February 1944 Stalin [[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|deported all]] the Chechens and [[Ingush people|Ingush]] to [[Kazakh SSR|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz SSR]]s. Up to a quarter of these people died during the "resettlement."<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia.'' Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. ISBN 0-87113-906-5. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe.'' Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-674-00994-0. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929<U+2013>1953.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. ISBN 0-7190-6377-9. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would have the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C.

===The First Chechen War===
[[File:Evstafiev-helicopter-shot-down.jpg|thumb|A Russian helicopter downed by Chechen militants near the capital [[Grozny]], during the [[First Chechen War]]]]
{{Main|First Chechen War}}
During the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chechnya [[declaration of independence|declared independence]]. In 1992, Chechen and Ingush leaders signed an agreement splitting the joint Chechen-Ingush republic in two, with Ingushetia joining the Russian Federation and Chechnya remaining independent. The debate over independence ultimately led to a small-scale civil war since 1992, in which the Russians supported the opposition forces against [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. Thousands of people of non-Chechen ethnicity (mostly Russians) fled the Chechen Republic and Chechnya's industrial production began failing after Russian engineers and workers fled or were expelled. The [[First Chechen War]] began in 1994, when Russian forces entered Chechnya to "restore constitutional order". Following nearly two years of brutal fighting, in which an estimated tens of thousands to more than 100,000 people died, and the 1996 [[Khasav-Yurt Accord|Khasavyurt ceasefire]] agreement, the Russian troops were withdrawn from the republic.<ref>Campana,Aurelie."The Effects of War on the Chechen National Identity Construction."Article 8.2(2006):129-148</ref>

==Prelude to the Second Chechen War==

===Chaos in Chechnya===
Following the first war, the separatist government's grip on the chaotic republic was weak, especially outside the ruined capital Grozny. The areas controlled by separatist groups grew larger and the country became increasingly lawless.<ref name="global">{{cite web|title=Second Chechnya War <U+2013> 1999<U+2013>???|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The war ravages and lack of economic opportunities left large numbers of heavily armed and brutalized former separatist fighters with no occupation but further violence. The authority of the government in Grozny was opposed by extremist warlords like [[Arbi Barayev]] and [[Salman Raduyev]]. Abductions and raids into other parts of the Northern Caucasus by various Chechen warlords had been steadily increasing.<ref name="col">Lajos F. Sz<U+00E1>szdi, ''Russian Civil-Military Relations and the Origins of the Second Chechen War'', page 155, University Press of America, 2008. ISBN 0-7618-4037-0</ref> In place of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over $200&nbsp;million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state.<ref>Tishkov, Valery. ''Chechnya: Life in a War-Torn Society.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004. Page 114.</ref> It has been estimated that up to 1,300 people were kidnapped in Chechnya between 1996 and 1999,<ref name="global"/> and in 1998 [[1998 abduction of foreign engineers in Chechnya|a group of four Western hostages were executed]]. Political violence and religious extremism, in the form of Islamist [[Wahhabism]], was rife as well. In 1998, a [[state of emergency]] was declared by the authorities in Grozny. Tensions led to the open clashes like the July 1998 confrontation in [[Gudermes]] in which some 50 people died in the fight between Chechen National Guard and the Islamist militias.

===Russian-Chechen relations 1996<U+2013>1999===
The 1997 election brought to power the separatist president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]. In 1998 and 1999 President Maskhadov survived several assassination attempts,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} blamed on the Russian intelligence services. In March 1999, General [[Gennady Shpigun]], the [[Kremlin]]'s envoy to Chechnya, was kidnapped at the airport in Grozny, and ultimately found dead in 2000 during the war.

The political tensions were fueled in part by allegedly Chechen or pro-Chechen terrorist and criminal activity in Russia, as well as border clashes.

===Russian plans for the war===
On 7 March 1999 interior minister [[Sergei Stepashin]] called for an invasion of Chechnya, in response to the abduction of MVD General [[Gennady Shpigun]]. However, Stepashin's plan was overridden by the prime minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]].<ref name="russell">{{Cite book|last=Russell|first=John|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|year=2005|edition=1st|pages=239<U+2013>265|chapter=Chechnya, 11 September and the War Against Terrorism|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5|accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref> Stepashin later said:<ref>from the Russian original of interview given by Stepashin: <U+0412> <U+043E><U+0442><U+043D><U+043E><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0447><U+043D><U+0438> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0433><U+0443> <U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+0437><U+0430><U+0442><U+044C> <U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+0443><U+044E><U+0449><U+0435><U+0435>. <U+041F><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+0434><U+0435><U+0439><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0432> <U+044D><U+0442><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0435> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0447><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441> <U+043C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442><U+0430>. <U+0418> <U+043C><U+044B> <U+043F><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438> <U+0432><U+044B><U+0439><U+0442><U+0438> <U+043A> <U+0422><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+043A><U+0443> <U+0432> <U+0430><U+0432><U+0433><U+0443><U+0441><U+0442><U+0435>-<U+0441><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+044F><U+0431><U+0440><U+0435>. <U+0422><U+0430><U+043A> <U+0447><U+0442><U+043E> <U+044D><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0438><U+0437><U+043E><U+0448><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0431><U+044B>, <U+0434><U+0430><U+0436><U+0435> <U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+0438> <U+0431><U+044B> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+0431><U+044B><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0432><U+0437><U+0440><U+044B><U+0432><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0432> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+0432><U+0435>. <U+042F> <U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+043E> <U+0432><U+0435><U+043B> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+043E><U+0442><U+0443> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0443><U+043A><U+0440><U+0435><U+043F><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E> <U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446> <U+0441> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0447><U+043D><U+0435><U+0439>, <U+0433><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432><U+044F><U+0441><U+044C> <U+043A> <U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0443><U+043F><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E>. <U+0422><U+0430><U+043A> <U+0447><U+0442><U+043E> <U+0412><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+043C><U+0438><U+0440> <U+041F><U+0443><U+0442><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0437><U+0434><U+0435><U+0441><U+044C> <U+043D><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+043E><U+0442><U+043A><U+0440><U+044B><U+043B>. <U+041E><U+0431> <U+044D><U+0442><U+043E><U+043C> <U+0432><U+044B> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0436><U+0435><U+0442><U+0435> <U+0441><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0438><U+0442><U+044C> <U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0441><U+0430><U+043C><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E>. <U+041E><U+043D> <U+0431><U+044B><U+043B> <U+0432> <U+0442><U+043E> <U+0432><U+0440><U+0435><U+043C><U+044F> <U+0434><U+0438><U+0440><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+043C> <U+0424><U+0421><U+0411> <U+0438> <U+0432><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043B> <U+0432><U+0441><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0438><U+043D><U+0444><U+043E><U+0440><U+043C><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+0435><U+0439>.</ref>

===Attacks and border clashes===
On 16 November 1996, in [[Kaspiysk]] (Dagestan) a bomb destroyed an apartment building housing Russian border guards; 68 people died. The cause of the blast was never determined, but many in Russia blamed it on Chechen separatists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1976776.stm |work=BBC News|title=Deadly blast hits Russian parade|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Three people died on 23 April 1997, when a bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]] ([[Krasnodar Krai]]), and two on 28 May 1997, when another bomb exploded in the Russian railway station of [[Pyatigorsk]] ([[Stavropol Krai]]).

On 22 December 1997, forces of [[Dagestan]]i militants and Chechnya-based [[Arab]] warlord [[Ibn al-Khattab]] raided the base of the 136th Motor Rifle Brigade of the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian Army]] in [[Buynaksk]], Dagestan, inflicting severe losses on the men<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=2&issue_id=328&article_id=3598 The Jamestown Foundation; CHECHEN GUNMEN ATTACK RUSSIAN ARMY UNIT IN DAGESTAN.]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref> and equipment of the unit. In late May Russia announced that it was closing the Russian-Chechnya border in an attempt to combat attacks and criminal activity; border guards were ordered to shoot suspects on sight. On 18 June 1999, seven servicemen were killed when Russian border guard posts were attacked in Dagestan. On 29 July 1999, the Russian Interior Ministry troops destroyed a Chechen border post and captured a 800 meter-section of strategic road. On 22 August 1999, 10 Russian policemen were killed by an [[anti-tank mine]] blast in [[North Ossetia]], and on 9 August 1999 six servicemen were kidnapped in the Ossetian capital [[Vladikavkaz]].

<!-- Commented out: [[File:Shamil basayev.jpg|Shamil Basaev led armies of militants from Chechnya to conquer the neighbouring [[Republic of Dagestan]] (Russia) in 1999|right|thumb]] -->

The Invasion of Dagestan was the trigger for the Second Chechen War. In August and September 1999, [[Shamil Basayev]] (in association with the [[Saudi]]-born Ibn al-Khattab, Commander of the Mujahedeen) led two armies of up to 2,000 Chechen, Dagestani, Arab and international [[mujahideen]] and Wahhabist militants from Chechnya into the neighboring Republic of Dagestan. This war saw the first (unconfirmed) use of aerial-delivered [[fuel air explosive]]s (FAE) in mountainous areas, notably in the village of [[Tando]].<ref>http://www.hrw.org/news/2000/02/17/dont-use-fuel-air-weapons-chechnya</ref> By mid-September 1999, the militants were routed from the villages and pushed back into Chechnya.

===Bombings in Russia===
{{Main|Russian apartment bombings}}

Before the wake of the Dagestani invasion had settled, a series of bombings took place in Russia (in Moscow and in [[Volgodonsk]]) and in the Dagestani town of Buynaksk. On 4 September 1999, 62 people died in an apartment building housing members of families of Russian soldiers. Over the next two weeks, the bombs targeted three other apartment buildings and a mall; in total nearly 300 people were killed. Khattab initially claimed responsibility for the bombings, but later denied responsibility. This was followed by an anonymous caller, who said he belonged to a group called the [[Liberation Army of Dagestan]].<ref name="bbc_who">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/449325.stm|title=Russia's bombs: Who is to blame?|publisher=BBC News|date=30 September 1999|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> There were no other calls or acts by the Liberation Army of Dagestan.

A criminal investigation of the bombings was completed in 2002. The results of the investigation, and the court ruling that followed, concluded that they were organized by [[Achemez Gochiyaev]], who remains at large, and ordered by Khattab and [[Abu Omar al-Saif]] (both of whom were later killed), in retaliation for the Russian counteroffensive against their incursion into Dagestan. Six other suspects have been convicted by Russian courts. However, many observers, including [[State Duma]] deputies [[Yuri Shchekochikhin]], [[Sergei Kovalev]] and [[Sergei Yushenkov]], cast doubts on the official version and sought an independent investigation. Some others, including [[David Satter]], [[Yury Felshtinsky]], [[Vladimir Pribylovsky]] and [[Alexander Litvinenko]], as well as the secessionist Chechen authorities, claimed that the 1999 bombings were a [[false flag]] attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya, which boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director [[Vladimir Putin]]'s popularity, brought the pro-war [[Unity (political party, Russia)|Unity Party]] to the [[State Duma]] and him to the presidency within a few months.<ref

===Air war===
{{Campaignbox Second Chechen War}}
{{Main|1999 Russian bombing of Chechnya}}
{{See also|List of Russian aircraft losses in the Second Chechen War}}

In late August and September 1999, Russia mounted a massive [[air war|air campaign]] over Chechnya, with the stated aim of wiping out militants who invaded Dagestan the previous month. On 26 August 1999 Russia acknowledged bombing raids in Chechnya.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20000919000313/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9908/26/russia.chechnya/ Russia acknowledges bombing raids in Chechnya], CNN, 26 August 1999</ref> The Russian air strikes were reported to have forced at least 100,000 Chechens to flee their homes to safety; the neighbouring region of Ingushetia was reported to have appealed for United Nations aid to deal with tens of thousands of refugees.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0927/russia.html Russia launches more air strikes against Chechnya], RT<U+00C9> news, 27 September 1999</ref> On 2 October 1999, Russia's [[Ministry of Extraordinary Situations (Russian Federation)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] admitted that 78,000 people have fled the air strikes in Chechnya; most of them were heading for [[Ingushetia]], where they were arriving at a rate of 5,000 to 6,000 a day.

As of 22 September 1999 Deputy [[Interior Minister]] Igor Zubov said that Russian troops had surrounded Chechnya and were prepared to retake the region, but the military planners were advising against a ground invasion because of the likelihood of heavy Russian casualties. By the end of September Russian forces made repeated incursions onto Chechen soil, and had captured some territory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Land war===
The Chechen conflict entered a new phase on 1 October 1999, when Russia's new Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] declared the authority of Chechen President [[Aslan Maskhadov]] and his parliament illegitimate{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. At this time, Putin announced that Russian troops would initiate a land invasion but progress only as far as the [[Terek River]], which cuts the northern third of Chechnya off from the rest of the republic. Putin's stated intention was to take control of Chechnya's northern plain and establish a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against further Chechen aggression; however, later recalled that the cordon alone was "pointless and technically impossible," apparently because of Chechnya's rugged terrain. According to Russian accounts, Putin accelerated a plan for a major crackdown against Chechnya that had been drawn up months earlier.<ref>David Hoffman [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/63/251.html Miscalculations Paved Path to Chechen War] ''[[Washington Post]]'', 20 March 2000</ref>

The Russian army moved with ease in the wide open spaces of northern Chechnya and on 5 October 1999, reached the Terek River. On this day, a bus filled with refugees was reportedly hit by a Russian [[Shell (projectile)|tank shell]], killing at least 11 civilians;<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9910/07/chechnya.bus/ Refugee bus reportedly shelled by Russian tank] CNN, 7 October 1999</ref> two days later, Russian [[Su-24]] [[fighter bomber]]s dropped [[cluster bomb]]s on the village of [[Elistanzhi]], [[Elistanzhi cluster bomb attack|killing some 35 people]].<ref name="villagers">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991011/ai_n14278495 Russian warplanes kill dozens of villagers] [[The Independent]], 11 October 1999</ref> On 10 October 1999, Maskhadov outlined a peace plan offering a crackdown on renegade warlords;<ref name="villagers" /> the offer was rejected by the Russian side. He also appealed to [[NATO]] to help end fighting between his forces and Russian troops, without effect.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991009/ige09005.html Russia to 'display' truth on Chechnya], Reuters, 9 October 1999</ref>

On 12 October 1999, the Russian forces crossed the Terek and began a two-pronged advance on the capital Grozny to the south. Hoping to avoid the significant casualties which plagued the first Chechen War, the Russians advanced slowly and in force, making extensive use of [[artillery]] and [[air power]] in an attempt to soften Chechen defences. Many thousands of civilians fled the Russian advance, leaving Chechnya for neighbouring Russian republics. Their numbers were later estimated to reach 200,000 to 350,000, out of the approximately 800,000 residents of the Chechen Republic. The Russians appeared to be taking no chances with the Chechen population in its rear areas, setting up "[[filtration camps]]" in October in northern Chechnya for detaining suspected members of ''bandformirovaniya'' militant formations, literally: "bandit formations").

On 15 October 1999, Russian forces took control of a strategic ridge within artillery range of the Chechen capital Grozny after mounting an intense tank and artillery barrage against Chechen fighters. In response, President Maskhadov declared a ''[[Ghazw|gazavat]]'' ([[religious war|holy war]]) to confront the approaching Russian army. [[Martial law]] was declared in Ichkeria and [[Military reserves|reservists]] were called; but no martial law or [[state of emergency]] had been declared in Chechnya or Russia by the Russian government.<ref>[http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2005/Feb/ChamberjudgmentsChechencases2422005.htm CHAMBER JUDGMENTS IN SIX APPLICATIONS AGAINST RUSSIA] [[European Court of Human Rights]], 24 February 2005</ref> The next day, Russian forces captured strategic [[Tersky Heights]] within sight of Grozny, dislodging 200 entrenched Chechen fighters.

On 21 October 1999, a Russian [[short-range ballistic missile]] strike on the central Grozny [[Grozny marketplace attack|killed more than 140 people]], including many women and children, and left hundreds more wounded.

On 12 November 1999, the [[Russian flag]] was raised over Chechnya's second largest city, [[Gudermes]], when the local Chechen commanders, the [[Yamadayev brothers]], defected to the federal side; the Russians also entered the bombed-out former Cossack village of [[Assinovskaya]]. The fighting in and around Kulary continued until January 2000. On 17 November 1999, Russian soldiers dislodged separatists in [[Bamut]], the symbolic separatist stronghold in the first war; dozens of Chechen fighters and many civilians were reported killed, and the village was levelled in the [[thermobaric weapon|FAE]] bombing. Two days later, after a failed attempt five days earlier, Russian forces managed to capture the village of [[Achkhoy-Martan]].

On 26 November 1999, Deputy Army [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] [[Valery Manilov]] said that phase two of the Chechnya campaign was just about complete, and a final third phase was about to begin. According to Manilov, the aim of the third phase was to destroy "bandit groups" in the mountains. A few days later Russia's Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Russian forces might need up to three more months to complete their military campaign in Chechnya, while some generals said the offensive could be over by New Year's Day. The next day the Chechens briefly recaptured the town of [[Novogroznensky]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/597594.stm Can Russia win the Chechen war?] BBC News, 10 January 2000</ref>

On 1 December 1999, after weeks of heavy fighting, Russian forces under [[Major General]] [[Vladimir Shamanov]] took control of [[Alkhan-Yurt]], a village just south of Grozny. The Chechen and foreign fighters inflicted heavy losses on the Russian forces, reportedly killing more than 70 Russian soldiers before retreating,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/russia_chechnya2/index.htm#TopOfPage|title=Russia/Chechnya: "No Happiness Remains": Civilian Killings, Pillage, And Rape In Alkhan-Yurt, Chechnya|publisher=Hrw.org|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> suffering heavy losses of their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.lv/?s=79&id=658|title=A letter of Sgt. S.Durov|publisher=Army.lv|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> On the same day, Chechen separatist forces began carrying out a series of counter-attacks against federal troops in several villages as well as in the outskirts of Gudermes. Chechen fighters in [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]], a small town five kilometres east of Grozny, put up some of the strongest resistance to federal troops since the start of Moscow's military offensive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The separatists in the town of [[Urus-Martan]] also offered fierce resistance, employing [[guerilla tactics]] Russia had been anxious to avoid; by 9 December 1999, Russian forces were still bombarding Urus-Martan, although Chechen commanders said their fighters had already pulled out. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

On 4 December 1999, the commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, General [[Viktor Kazantsev]], claimed that Grozny was fully blockaded by Russian troops. The Russian military's next task was the seizure of the town of [[Shali, Chechen Republic|Shali]], 20 kilometres south-east of the capital, one of the last remaining separatist-held towns apart from Grozny. Russian troops started by capturing two bridges that link Shali to the capital, and by 11 December 1999, Russian troops had encircled Shali and were slowly forcing separatists out. By mid-December the Russian military was concentrating attacks in southern parts of Chechnya and preparing to launch another offensive from Dagestan.

===Siege of Grozny===
{{Main|Battle of Grozny (1999<U+2013>2000)}}

Meanwhile, the assault on Grozny started in early December. The battle accompanied by the struggle for the neighbouring settlements ended when the Russian army seized the city on 2 February 2000.

According to the official Russian figures, at least 368 federal troops and an unknown number of pro-Russian militiamen died in Grozny. The separatist forces too suffered heavy losses, including losing several top commanders. Russian Defense Minister [[Igor Sergeyev]] said that 1,500 separatists were killed trying to leave Grozny. The separatists said they lost at least 400 fighters in the [[mine field]] at [[Alkhan-Kala]].<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/04/russia.chechnya.01/index.html Russia may withdraw some troops from Chechnya]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

The siege and fighting left the capital devastated like no other European city since World War II; in 2003 the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6414603.stm Scars remain amid Chechen revival] BBC News, 3 March 2007</ref>

The Russians suffered heavy losses also as they advanced elsewhere, and from the series of Chechen counterattacks and convoy ambushes. On 26 January 2000, the Russian government announced that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since October<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/618971.stm|title=Russia admits heavy casualties|date=26 January 2000|accessdate=10 June 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref> <U+2013> a more than double rise from 544 killed reported just 19 days earlier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/592919.stm|title=Russian army battered in Grozny|date=6 January 2000|accessdate=10 June 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref>

===Battle for the mountains===
Heavy fighting accompanied by a massive shelling and bombing continued through the winter of 2000 in the mountainous south of Chechnya, particularly in the areas around Argun, [[Vedeno]] and [[Shatoy]], where the fighting involving Russian [[paratroopers]] raged since 1999.

On 9 February 2000 a Russian tactical missile hit a crowd of people who had come to the local administration building in Shali, a town previously declared as one of the "safe areas", to collect their pensions. The attack was a response to a report that a group of fighters had entered the town. The missile is estimated to have killed some 150 civilians, and was followed by an attack by combat helicopters causing further casualties.<ref>Oleg Orlov [http://www.crimesofwar.org/expert/chech-oleg.html War Crimes and Human Rights Violations in Chechnya] 26 May 2000</ref> [[Human Rights Watch]] has called on the Russian military to stop using FAE, known in Russia as "[[vacuum bombs]]", in Chechnya, concerned about the large number of civilian casualties caused by what it calls "the widespread and often indiscriminate bombing and shelling by Russian forces".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/644087.stm Russians urged to stop 'vacuum' bombings] BBC News, 15 February 2000</ref> On 18 February 2000, a Russian army transport helicopter was shot down in the south, killing 15 men aboard, Russian Interior Minister [[Vladimir Rushailo]] said in a rare admission by Moscow of losses in the war.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/648895.stm Chechens down Russian helicopter] BBC News, 19 February 2000</ref>

On 29 February 2000, United Army Group commander [[Gennady Troshev]] said that "the counter-terrorism operation in Chechnya is over. It will take a couple of weeks longer to pick up splinter groups now." Russia's Defense Minister, [[Marshal of the Russian Federation]] [[Igor Sergeyev]], evaluated numerical strength of the separatists at between 2,000 and 2,500 men, "scattered all over Chechnya." On the same day, a Russian [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] paratroop company from [[Pskov]] was [[Battle of Hill 776|attacked by Chechen and Arab fighters]] near the village of [[Ulus-Kert]] in Chechnya's southern lowlands; at least 84 Russian soldiers were killed in the especially heavy fighting. The official newspaper of the [[Russian Ministry of Defense]] reported that at least 400 separatists were killed, figures which they said were based on radio-intercept data, intelligence reports, eyewitnesses, local residents and captured Chechens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC/milreview/English/JulAug01/JulAug01/bobja01.pdf|title=Reassessing Strategy: A Historical Examination|publisher=Usacac.army.mil|date=11 October 2011|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> On 2 March 2000, a unit of [[OMON]] from [[Podolsk]] [[Grozny OMON fratricide incident|opened fire in Grozny]] on another OMON unit from [[Sergiyev Posad]]; at least 24 Russian servicemen were killed in the incident.

On 29 March 2000, a total of about 52 Russian soldiers were killed as a result of the [[Vedeno ambush|separatist ambush on the OMON convoy]] from [[Perm]].

On 23 April 2000, a 22-vehicle convoy carrying ammunition and other supplies to the [[Airborne forces|airborne]] unit was ambushed near [[Serzhen-Yurt]] in the Vedeno Gorge, by an estimated 80 to 100 "bandits" according to General Troshev; in the ensuing 4-hour battle the federal side lost 15 government soldiers, according to the Russian defence minister. General Troshev told the press that the bodies of four separatist fighters were found. The Russian Airborne Troops headquarters later stated that 20 separatists were killed and 2 taken prisoner.<ref>Captain Adam Geibel [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FDF/is_1_31/ai_78974282 Ambush at Serzhen Yurt: Command-Detonated Mines in the Second Chechen War] Engineer: The Professional Bulletin for Army Engineers, Feb 2001</ref> Soon, the Russian forces seized last populated centres of the organized resistance. (Another offensive against the remaining mountain strongholds was launched by the Russian forces in December 2000.)

===Restoration of federal government===
{{Main|Federal government in Chechnya}}

Russian President Vladimir Putin established [[direct rule]] of Chechnya in May 2000. The following month, Putin appointed [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] interim head of the pro-Moscow government. This development met with early approval in the rest of Russia, but the continued deaths of Russian troops dampened public enthusiasm. On 23 March 2003, a new Chechen constitution was passed in a referendum. The 2003 Constitution granted the Chechen Republic a significant degree of [[autonomy]], but still tied it firmly to Russia and Moscow's rule, and went into force on 2 April 2003. The referendum was strongly supported by the Russian government but met a harsh critical response from Chechen separatists; many citizens chose to boycott the ballot. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Akhmad Kadyrov was assassinated by a bomb blast in 2004. Since December 2005, his son [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], leader of the pro-Moscow militia known as ''[[kadyrovtsy]]'', has been functioning as the Chechnya's ''de facto'' ruler. Kadyrov has become Chechnya's most powerful leader and in February 2007, with support from Putin, Ramzan Kadyrov replaced [[Alu Alkhanov]] as president.

==Insurgency==

===Guerrilla war in Chechnya===
{{Main|Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War}}

:''Guerrilla phase by year: [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2000)|2000]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2001)|2001]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2002)|2002]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2003)|2003]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2004)|2004]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2005)|2005]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2006)|2006]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2007)|2007]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2008)|2008]], [[Guerrilla phase of the Second Chechen War (2009)|2009]]''

Although large-scale fighting within Chechnya had ceased, daily attacks continued particularly in the southern portions of Chechnya, spilling into nearby territories of the Caucasus as well, especially since the [[Caucasian Front (Chechen War)|Caucasus Front]] was established. Typically small separatist units target Russian and pro-Russian officials, [[security force]]s, and military and police convoys and vehicles. The separatist units employ [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and sometimes group up for larger raids. Russian forces then retaliate with artillery and air strikes, as well as [[counter-insurgency]] operations. Most soldiers in Chechnya are now ''[[Russian Ground Forces#Kontraktniki|kontraktniki]]'' (contract soldiers) as opposed to the earlier [[conscription|conscripts]]. While Russia continues to maintain military presence within Chechnya, Russia's federal forces play less of a direct role in Chechnya. Pro-Kremlin Chechen forces under the command of the local strongman Ramzan Kadyrov, known as the ''[[kadyrovtsy]]'' now dominate law enforcement and security operations, with many members (including Kadyrov himself) being former Chechen separatists who have defected since 1999. Since 2004, the Kadyrovtsy were partly incorporated into two Interior Ministry units ''North'' and ''South'' (''Sever'' and ''Yug''). Two other units of the Chechen pro-Moscow forces, ''East'' and ''West'' ([[Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad|''Vostok'' and ''Zapad'']]), are commanded by [[Sulim Yamadayev]] (''Vostok'') and [[Said-Magomed Kakiyev]] (''Zapad'') and their men.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1796576,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Land of the warlords|date=13 June 2006|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref>

On 16 April 2009 the head of the [[Federal Security Service]], [[Alexander Bortnikov]], announced that they "cancelled the decree imposing an anti-terror operation on the territory of, effective from midnight". According to Chechen President [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] the announcement means that the war is finished by their victory. Still while Chechnya has largely stabilised, there are clashes with militants in the nearby regions of Dagestan and Ingushetia.<ref name="smh-end">{{Cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/russia-ends-10year-chechnya-operation-20090416-a8mi.html|title=Russia ends 10-year Chechnya operation|last=Williams|first=Stuart|date=16 April 2009|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref>

===Suicide attacks===
{{Main|Chechen suicide attacks}}
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Photo09.jpg|thumb|200px|[[2002 Grozny suicide bombing|2002 Grozny truck bombing]] of the republican government complex]] -->

Between June 2000 and September 2004 Chechen insurgents added [[suicide attack]]s to their tactics. During this period there have been 23 Chechen related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya. The profiles of the Chechen suicide bombers have varied just as much as the circumstances surrounding the bombings, most of which targeted military or government-related targets.

===Assassinations===
{{Main|List of Second Chechen War assassinations}}

Both sides of the war carried out multiple assassinations. The most prominent of these included the 13 February 2004 killing of exiled former separatist Chechen President [[Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev]] in Qatar, and the 9 May 2004 killing of pro-Russian Chechen President [[Akhmad Kadyrov]] during the parade in Grozny.

===Caucasus Front===
{{Main|Caucasian Front (Chechen War)}}

While the anti-Russian local insurgencies in the North Caucasus started even before the war, in May 2005, two months after Maskahdov's death, the Chechen separatists officially announced that they had formed a [[Caucasus Front]] within the framework of "reforming the system of military-political power." Along with the Chechen, Dagestani and Ingush "sectors," the [[Stavropol]], [[Kabardin]]-[[Balkar]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Karachai]]-[[Circassians|Circassian]], [[Ossetians|Ossetian]] and [[Adyghe people|Adyghe]] ''jamaats'' were included in it. This, in essence, means that practically all the regions of the Russia's south are involved in the hostilities.

The Chechen separatist movement has taken on a new role as the official ideological, [[logistical]] and, probably, financial hub of the new insurgency in the North Caucasus.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/30/opinion/edaslan.php Beslan's unanswered questions] [[International Herald Tribune]], 30 May 2006</ref> Increasingly frequent clashes between federal forces and local militants continue in Dagestan, while sporadic fighting erupts in the other southern Russia regions, most notably in Ingushetia, but also elsewhere, [[October 2005 Nalchik attack|notably in Nalchik]] on 13 October 2005.

==Human rights and terrorism==

===Human rights and war crimes===
{{Campaignbox Second Chechen War civilian attacks}}
[[File:Mass grave in Chechnya.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Mass graves in Chechnya|mass grave in Chechnya]]]]
Russian officials and Chechen separatists have regularly and repeatedly accused the opposing side of committing various war crimes including kidnapping, murder, hostage taking, looting, rape, and assorted other breaches of the [[laws of war]]. International and humanitarian organizations, including the [[Council of Europe]] and [[Amnesty International]], have criticized both sides of the conflict for "blatant and sustained" violations of [[international humanitarian law]].

Western European rights groups estimate there have been about 5,000 [[forced disappearance]]s in Chechnya since 1999.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5219254.stm Russia censured over Chechen man] [[BBC]]</ref>

American Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] noted in her 24 March 2000, speech to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]:

:We cannot ignore the fact that thousands of Chechen civilians have died and more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial killings]]. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners.... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, both at home and abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.<ref>[http://geneva.usmission.gov/press2000/0427chechnya.html U.S. Response to Human Rights Commission Resolution on Chechnya] U.S. Mission Geneva</ref>

According to the 2001 annual report by Amnesty International:

:There were frequent reports that Russian forces indiscriminately bombed and shelled civilian areas. Chechen civilians, including medical personnel, continued to be the target of military attacks by Russian forces. Hundreds of Chechen civilians and prisoners of war were extra judicially executed. Journalists and independent monitors continued to be refused access to Chechnya. According to reports, Chechen fighters frequently threatened, and in some cases killed, members of the Russian-appointed civilian administration and executed Russian captured soldiers.<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN+Federation?OpenDocument Russian Federation 2001 Report] [[Amnesty International]]</ref>

In 2001 the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] has placed Chechnya on its [[Genocide]] Watch List:

:Chechnya was devastated, including the almost complete destruction of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Russian artillery and air indiscriminately pounded populated areas. Human rights organizations also documented several massacres of civilians by Russian units. Russian President Vladimir Putin proclaimed Chechnya pacified by Spring 2000. But peace has been elusive for Chechen civilians, victims of a continuing [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. They are plagued by abuses committed by Russian forces <U+2013> arbitrary arrest, extortion, torture, murder. Chechen civilians also suffer because there have been no sustained efforts to rebuild basic social services, such as public utilities or education. Chechen fighters also commit abuses against civilians, but neither on the same scale nor with the same intensity as Russian forces.<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/conscience/alert/chechnya/ Chechnya Overview] [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]</ref>

The Russian government failed to pursue any accountability process for [[human rights abuses]] committed during the course of the conflict in Chechnya. Unable to secure justice domestically, hundreds of victims of abuse have filed applications with the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR). In March 2005 the court issued the first rulings on Chechnya, finding the Russian government guilty of violating the right to life and even if the prohibition of torture with respect to civilians who had died or forcibly disappeared at the hands of Russia's federal troops.<ref>[http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&s=f&o=239843&apc_state=henicrs2005 European Court Rules Against Moscow] [[Institute for War and Peace Reporting]], 2 March 2005M</ref> Many similar claims were ruled since against Russia.

Dozens of [[Mass graves in Chechnya|mass graves]] containing hundreds of corpses have been uncovered since the beginning of the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]] in 1994.

===Terrorist attacks===
{{Campaignbox Second Chechen War terrorism}}

Between May 2002 and September 2004, the Chechen and Chechen-led militants, mostly answering to Shamil Basayev, launched a campaign of terrorism directed against civilian targets in Russia. About 200 people were killed in a series of bombings (most of them suicide attacks), most of them in the [[2003 Stavropol train bombing]] (46), the [[February 2004 Moscow metro bombing|2004 Moscow metro bombing]] (40), and the [[Russian aircraft bombings of August 2004|2004 Russian aircraft bombings]] (89).

Two large-scale hostage takings, the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] (850 hostages) and the [[Beslan school hostage crisis|2004 Beslan school siege]] (about 1,200), resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. In the Moscow stand-off, FSB [[Spetsnaz]] forces stormed the buildings on the third day using a [[Moscow hostage crisis chemical agent|lethal chemical agent]]. Some 20 Beslan hostages had been executed by their captors before the storming.

==Other issues==

===Pankisi crisis===
{{Main|Georgian<U+2013>Russian relations|2001 Kodori crisis}}

Russian officials have accused the bordering republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] of allowing Chechen separatists to operate on Georgian territory and permitting the flow of militants and [[materiel]] across the Georgian border with Russia. In February 2002, the United States began offering assistance to Georgia in combating "criminal elements" as well as alleged Arab [[mujahideen]] activity in [[Pankisi Gorge]] as [[War on Terrorism: Pankisi Gorge|part of the War on Terrorism]]. Without resistance, Georgian troops have detained an Arab man and six criminals, and declared the region under control.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2231955.stm Georgia says gorge 'under control'] BBC News, 2 September 2002</ref> In August 2002, Georgia accused Russia of a series of secret [[air strike]]s on purported separatists havens in the Pankisi Gorge in which a Georgian civilian was reported killed.

On 8 October 2001, a [[United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia|UNOMIG]] helicopter was shot down in Georgia in [[Kodori Valley]] gorge near Abkhazia, amid [[2001 Kodori crisis|fighting between Chechens and Abkhazians]], killing nine including five UN observers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1586098.stm UN helicopter shot down in Georgia] BBC News, 8 October 2001</ref> Georgia denied having troops in the area, and the suspicion fell on the armed group headed by Chechen warlord [[Ruslan Gelayev]], who was speculated to have been hired by the Georgian government to wage [[proxy war]] against separatist [[Abkhazia]]. On 2 March 2004, following a number of cross-border raids from Georgia into Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, Gelayev was killed in a clash with Russian border guards while trying to get back from Dagestan into Georgia.

===Unilateral ceasefire of 2005===
On 2 February 2005, Chechen separatist president Aslan Maskhadov issued a call for a [[ceasefire]] lasting until at least 22 February (the day preceding the anniversary of Stalin's deportation of the Chechen population). The call was issued through a separatist website and addressed to President Putin, described as a gesture of [[Social capital|goodwill]]. On 8 March 2005, Maskhadov was killed in an operation by Russian security forces in the Chechen community of [[Tolstoy-Yurt]], northeast of Grozny.

Shortly following Maskhadov's death, the Chechen separatist council announced that [[Abdul-Khalim Sadulayev]] had assumed the leadership, a move that was quickly endorsed by Shamil Basayev (Basayev himself died in July 2006). On 2 February 2006, Sadulayev made large-scale changes in his government, ordering all its members to move into Chechen territory. Among other things, he removed First Vice-Premier [[Akhmed Zakayev]] from his post (although later Zakayev was appointed a Foreign Minister<ref>[http://chechenpress.net/events/2006/05/27/06.shtml <U+0423><U+043A><U+0430><U+0437><U+044B> <U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437><U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0427><U+0420><U+0418> <U+0410>-<U+0425>. <U+0421><U+0430><U+0434><U+0443><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430>], Chechenpress, 27.05.06</ref>). Sadulayev was killed in June 2006, after which he was succeeded as the separatist leader by the veteran terrorist commander Doku Umarov.

===Amnesties===
As of November 2007, there were at least seven amnesties for separatist militants, as well as federal servicemen who committed crimes, declared in Chechnya by Moscow since the start of the second war. The first one was announced in 1999 when about 400 Chechen switched sides. (However, according to Putin's advisor and aide [[Aslambek Aslakhanov]] most of them were since killed, both by their former comrades and by the Russians, who by then perceived them as a potential "[[fifth column]]".<ref>[http://www.kommersant.ru/k-vlast/get_page.asp?DocID=695544 "<U+0423><U+0431><U+0438><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B> <U+2013> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+0443><U+0431><U+0438><U+0432><U+0430><U+043B>, <U+043F><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+043B> <U+2013> <U+043D><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430><U+043B>"], Kommersant, 07.08.2006</ref>) Some of the other amnesties included one during September 2003 in connection with the adoption of the republic's new constitution, and then another between mid-2006 and January 2007. According to Ramzan Kadyrov, himself former separatist, more than 7,000 separatist fighters defected to the federal side ("returned to the peaceful life") by 2005. In 2006 more than 600 militants in Chechnya and adjacent provinces reportedly surrendered their arms in response to a six-month amnesty "for those not involved in any serious crimes".<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080116/97117813.html Law enforcers killed 72 militants in Chechnya in 2007], RIA Novosti, 16/ 01/ 2008</ref> In 2007, the [[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]] published a report entitled [http://www.ihf-hr.org/documents/doc_summary.php?sec_id=&d_id=4402 Amnestied People as Targets for Persecution in Chechnya], which documents the fate of several persons who have been amnestied and subsequently abducted, tortured and killed.

===Government censorship of the media coverage===
{{Main|Russian censorship of Chechnya coverage}}
{{Disputed-section|date=April 2008}}

The first war, with its extensive and largely unrestricted coverage (despite deaths of many journalists), convinced the Kremlin more than any other event that it needed to control national television channels, which most Russians rely on for news, to successfully undertake any major national policy. By the time the second war began, federal authorities had designed and introduced a comprehensive system to limit the access of journalists to Chechnya and shape their coverage.<ref>[http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/2048.cfm Smokescreen Around Chechnya] The Moscow Times, 18 March 2005</ref>

==Effects==

===Civilian losses===
{{Main|Casualties of the Second Chechen War}}
Civilian casualty estimates vary widely. According to the pro-Moscow government, 160,000 combatants and non-combatants died or have gone missing in the two wars, including 30,000<U+2013>40,000 Chechens and about 100,000 Russians;<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/08/15/news/chech.php Chechen official puts death toll for 2 wars at up to 160,000] International Herald Tribune, 16 August 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/08/b23f8d99-f15d-4b40-882c-975598c29ae3.html Russia: Chechen Official Puts War Death Toll At 160,000] RFE/RL, 16 August 2005</ref> while separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov (deceased) repeatedly claimed about 200,000 ethnic Chechens died as a consequence of the two conflicts.<ref>[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2005/08/16/011.html Death Toll Put at 160,000 in Chechnya] [[The Moscow Times]], 16 August 2005</ref> As in the case of military losses, these claims can not be independently verified.

===Environmental damage===
Environmental agencies warn that the Russian republic of Chechnya, devastated by war, now faces ecological disaster. A former aide to Boris Yeltsin believes Russian bombing has rendered Chechnya an "environmental wasteland."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/TED/ice/chechnya.htm|title=Chechnya Conflict and Environmental Implications|publisher=American.edu|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> There is a special concern over widespread [[oil spill]]s and pollution from [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] damaged by war (the water is polluted to a depth of 250 m<ref>[http://www.kommersant.com/p-92/r_436/Chechen_Republic/ Chechen Republic // GENERAL INFORMATION], Kommersant, 10 March 2004</ref>), and chemical and [[radioactive pollution]], as a result of the bombardment of chemical facilities and storages during the conflict.<ref name="ravaged" /> Chechnya's wildlife also sustained heavy damage during the hostilities, as animals that had once populated the Chechen forests have moved off to seek safer ground.<ref>[http://www.watchdog.cz/index.php?show=000000-000002-000001-000110-000048&lang=1 Military operations greatly alter Chechen mountain life], Prague Watchdog, 4 May 2003</ref> In 2004, Russian government has designated one-third of Chechnya a "zone of ecological disaster" and another 40% "a zone of extreme environmental distress".<ref>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/723/sc211.htm 'In the Caucasus, you can buy anything'], ''Al-Ahram Weekly'', 2004</ref>

===Land mines===
{{Main|Land mine situation in Chechnya}}

Chechnya is the most [[land mine]]-affected region worldwide.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/10/8f24150a-e534-42a8-80d9-198ae5453f89.html Chechnya: Land Mines Seen As Continuing Scourge] RFE/RL, 19 October 2004</ref> Since 1994 there have been widespread use of mines, by both sides (Russia is a party to the 1980 [[Convention on Conventional Weapons]] but not the 1996 protocol on land mines and other devices). The most heavily mined areas of Chechnya are those in which separatists continue to put up resistance, namely the southern regions, as well as the borders of the republic.<ref>[http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/chechnya Chechnya], LM Report 2004, 8 February 2005</ref> No humanitarian mine clearance has taken place since the [[HALO Trust]] was evicted by Russia in December 1999. In June 2002, [[Olara Otunnu]], the UN official, estimated that there were 500,000 land mines placed in the region. [[UNICEF]] has recorded 2,340 civilian land mine and [[unexploded ordnance]] casualties occurring in Chechnya between 1999 and the end of 2003.

===Military losses===
{{Main|Casualties of the Second Chechen War}}
Military casualty figures from both sides are impossible to verify and are generally believed to be higher. In September 2000, the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] compiled [http://www.watchdog.cz/index.php?show=000000-000005-000003-000001&lang=1 the list of casualties officially announced in the first year of the conflict], which, although incomplete and with little factual value, provide a minimum insight in the information war. According to the figures released by the [[Russian Ministry of Defence]] on in August 2005, at least 3,450 [[Russian Armed Forces]] soldiers have been [[killed in action]] 1999<U+2013>2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/index.php?show=000000-000005-000001-000182-000001-000005&lang=1|title=May 2001: Summary of main news related to the conflict in Chechnya|publisher=Watchdog.cz|accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> This death toll did not include losses of [[Internal Troops]], the FSB, police and local paramilitaries, all of whom at least 4,720 were killed by October 2003.<ref name="casualties">[http://www.hrvc.net/htmls/references.htm Civil and military casualties of the wars in Chechnya] [[Russian-Chechen Friendship Society]]</ref> The independent Russian and Western estimates are much higher; the [[Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia]] for instance estimated about 11,000 Russian Army servicemen have been killed between 1999 and 2003.<ref name="alert"/>

===Political radicalization of the separatist movement===
The Chechens had become increasingly radicalized. Former [[Soviet Army]] officers Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov have been succeeded by people who rely more on religious ideology, rather than the [[nationalism|nationalistic]] feelings of the population. While Dudayev and Maskhadov were seeking from Moscow recognition of the independence of the Chechen Republic Ichkeria, other leaders spoke out more about the need to expel Russia from the territory of the whole [[North Caucasus]], an impoverished mountain region inhabited mostly by Muslim, non-Russian ethnic groups.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In April 2006, asked whether negotiations with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander and future president [[Doku Umarov]] answered: "We offered them many times. But it turned out that we constantly press for negotiations and it's as if we are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more." In the same month, the new separatist spokesman [[Movladi Udugov]] said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: "Today, we have a different task on our hands <U+2013> [[total war]], war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the [[Islamist]] "North Caucasian [[Emirate]]".{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

This trend ultimately resulted in the October 2007 declaration of [[Caucasus Emirate]] by [[Doku Umarov]] where he also urged for a global Jihad, and the [[political schism]] between the moderates, and the radical Islamists fighting in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions with ties in the Middle East.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/chechnya/Story/0,,2214769,00.html The battle for the soul of Chechnya], ''The Guardian'', 22 November 2007</ref> Some commanders, still fighting along with Doku Umarov, like [[Anzor Astemirov]], have publicly denounced the idea of a global Jihad, but keep fighting for the independence of Caucasus states.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2373840 Chechnya Weekly from the Jamestown Foundation]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

The struggle has garnered support from Muslim sympathizers around the world nonetheless, and some of them have been willing to take up arms. Many commentators think it is likely that Chechen fighters have links with international Islamist separatist groups. The [[BBC]] said in an online Q&A on the conflict: "It has been known for years that Muslim volunteers have traveled to Chechnya to join the fight, reportedly after attending training camps in [[Afghan training camp|Afghanistan]] or [[Pakistan]]."<ref name="alert"/>

===Impact on the Chechen population===
According to a 2006 report by [[M<U+00E9>decins Sans Fronti<U+00E8>res]], "the majority of Chechens still struggle through lives burdened by fear, uncertainty and poverty." A survey conducted by MSF in September 2005 showed that 77% of the respondents were suffering from "discernible symptoms of psychological distress".<ref>[MSF Activity Reports on The Russian Federation: 2006 http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news/russianfederation.cfm], Doctors Without Borders</ref>

The start of the war bolstered the domestic popularity of Vladimir Putin as the campaign was started one month after he had become [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian prime minister]].<ref name="poll">[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=421&issue_id=4037&article_id=2372009 POLL FINDS A PLURALITY OF RUSSIANS DISTRUST RAMZAN] [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 27 March 2007</ref> The conflict greatly contributed to the deep changes in the Russian politics and society.<ref name="warlord">[http://economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9254176 The warlord and the spook] [[The Economist]], 31 March 2007</ref>

Since the Chechen conflict began in 1994, cases of young veterans returning embittered and traumatized to their home towns have been reported all across Russia. Psychiatrists, law-enforcement officials and journalists have started calling the condition of psychologically scarred soldiers "Chechen syndrome" (CS), drawing a parallel with the [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]s suffered by Soviet soldiers who fought in [[Afghanistan]]. According to Yuri Alexandrovsky, deputy director of the [[Moscow Serbsky Institute]] in 2003, at least 70% of the estimated 1.5&nbsp;million Chechnya veterans suffered CS.<ref>[http://205.188.238.181/time/printout/0,8816,901031006-490663,00.html Chechnya's Walking Wounded] [[Time (magazine)]]/CNN, 28 September 2003</ref> Many of the veterans came back alcoholic, unemployable and [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]].<ref name="warlord" /> Thousands were also physically [[disability|disabled]] for life and left with very limited help from the government.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20030430/ai_n14548271 Island lessons for Russian war vet], Oakland Tribune, 30 April 2003</ref>

According to the 2007 study by [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] and [[Demos (human rights center)|Demos]] human rights organisations, Russian policemen lose their qualifications and professional skills during their [[tour of duty|duty tours]] in Chechnya.<ref name="omon">[http://jamestown.org/chechnya_weekly/article.php?articleid=2374082 The Geography of OMON Deployments in the North Caucasus], [[The Jamestown Foundation]], 3 April 2008</ref> This conflict was linked to the rising brutality and general criminalisation of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that have been to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on [[police brutality]] are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% of respondents said they didn't trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4009-2005Mar26.html For Russians, Police Rampage Fuels Fear] ''[[Washington Post]]'', 27 March 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/06/da84eb4b-5f23-4876-8d61-bc4d6f4f6260.html Russia: Police Brutality Shows Traces Of Chechnya] RFE/RL, 20 June 2005</ref> According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now [[Endemism|endemic]].<ref name="warlord" /> Since 2007, police officers from outside Caucasus are now not only being sent to Chechnya, but to all the region's republics.<ref name="omon"/>

==Status==
In 2005 there were about 60,000 Federal troops in Chechnya, but that number has since decreased significantly. Tony Wood, a journalist and author who has written extensively about Chechnya, estimated there were about 8,000 local security forces remaining in the region {{As of|2007|lc=on}}. Independent analysts say there are no more than 2,000 armed separatist combatants still fighting, while Russia says only a few hundred remain. There is still some sporadic fighting in the mountains and south of the republic, but Russia has scaled down its presence significantly leaving the local government to stabilize things further.<ref name="alert"/> In February 2008 the President of the separatist [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], [[Dokka Umarov]], spoke of "thousands of fighters" when he addressed a speech to all his fighters in the mountains.<ref>[http://blip.tv/file/get/Kavkazcenter-873.wmv Dokka Umarov speech]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

Most of the more prominent past Chechen separatist leaders have died or have been killed, including former president [[Aslan Maskhadov]] and leading [[warlord]] and terrorist attack mastermind [[Shamil Basayev]]. Meanwhile, the fortunes of the Chechen independence movement sagged, plagued by the internal disunity between Chechen moderates and [[Islamist]] radicals and the changing global political climate after 11 September 2001, as well as the general war weariness of the Chechen population. Large-scale fighting has been replaced by [[guerrilla warfare]] and bombings targeting federal troops and forces of the regional government, with the violence often spilling over into adjacent regions. Since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of Chechnya proper and into the nearby Russian territories, such as [[Ingushetia]] and [[Dagestan]]; the [[Russian government]], for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the [[North Caucasus]].

With the abolition of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the proclamation of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] by the president of the separatist movement [[Dokka Umarov]], the conflict in Chechnya and the rest of the [[North Caucasus]] is often referred to as the "War in the North Caucasus". The Russian government has given no new name to the conflict while most international observers still refer to it as a continuation of the Second Chechen War.<ref>[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/04/containing_russia.html Articles <U+2013> Containing Russia].

In late April 2008, the Human Rights Commissioner for the [[Council of Europe]], [[Thomas Hammarberg]], visited Russia's Caucasian republics. After wrapping up the week long visit, he said he observed a number of positive developments in Chechnya, and that there was "obvious progress". He also noted that the [[judicial system]] in Chechnya was functioning properly. According to Hammarberg, missing people and the identification of missing bodies were still the two biggest human rights issues in the region, and he expressed his wish that further efforts be done to clarify the issue. President Putin responded to his comments, saying that the visit was of "great significance", and that Russia will take into account what the council had to say.<ref>[http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/Activities/news2008/080425Putin_en.asp Commissioner Hammarberg meets Putin and Medvedev] Retrieved: 8-26-08</ref><ref>[http://russiatoday.ru/news/news/23950 Russian Caucasus 'stabilising': EU Commissioner] Retrieved: 8-26-08</ref><ref>[http://russiatoday.ru/news/news/23832 Thousands still missing in Chechnya] Retrieved: 8-26-08</ref>
