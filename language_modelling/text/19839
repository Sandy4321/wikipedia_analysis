A '''general election in Japan''' was held on August 30, 2009,<ref name="August">{{cite news |title=Japan PM 'calls August election' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8147059.stm |publisher=[[BBC World News]] |accessdate=2009-07-13 |date=2009-07-13}}</ref> for all 480 seats of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] of [[Japan]], the lower house of the [[Diet of Japan]].

In the election, the opposition [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party]] (DPJ) defeated the ruling coalition ([[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and [[New Komeito Party]]). The LDP had ruled Japan since its formation in 1955, except for an 11-month period from 1993 to 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14340569 |title=Braced for change |publisher=The Economist |date=2009-08-29}}</ref> The DPJ received 42.4% of the proportional block votes cast, taking 308 seats to only 119 for the LDP (26.7% of the block votes).<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8229368.stm |title='Major win' for Japan opposition |publisher=BBC News |date= 2009-08-30|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/c?g=pol_date1&k=2009083101337 |title=<U+8846><U+9662><U+515A><U+6D3E><U+5225><U+5F97><U+7968><U+6570><U+30FB><U+7387><U+FF08><U+6BD4><U+4F8B><U+4EE3><U+8868><U+FF09> |publisher=(in Japanese) Jiji |date=2009-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jiji.com/jc/c?g=pol_date1&k=2009083101336 |title=<U+8846><U+9662><U+515A><U+6D3E><U+5225><U+5F97><U+7968><U+6570><U+30FB><U+7387><U+FF08><U+9078><U+6319><U+533A><U+FF09> |publisher=(in Japanese) Jiji |date=2009-08-31}}</ref>

Under [[Constitution of Japan|Japan's constitution]], this result virtually assured DPJ leader [[Yukio Hatoyama]] would be the next [[Prime Minister of Japan]].

Prime Minister [[Taro Aso]] conceded late on the night of August 30, 2009 that the LDP had lost control of the government, and announced his resignation as party president.<ref>{{cite news|author=From  Kyung Lah |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/30/japan.elections/index.html |title=Japanese opposition set for victory; PM quits as party head |publisher=[[CNN]] |date= 2009-08-31|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> A [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2009|leadership election]] was held on September 28, 2009.

The election marked the worst defeat for a governing party in modern Japanese history. It was only the second time the LDP has lost a general election, and was the first time since its formation that the LDP lost its status as the largest party in the lower house.

== Background ==
=== Developments towards the election ===
The last general election took place in [[japanese general election, 2005|2005]] in which the LDP, led by popular prime minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]], received 38.2% of the proportional block votes and 47.8% of the district votes cast (the next largest party, the DPJ, received 31% in the proportional and 36.4% in the district vote). Due to the characteristics of the [[Japanese election system]], the LDP ended up with 296 seats in the Lower House (61.6%), which enabled Koizumi to complete the privatization of [[Japan Post]]. Since then Japan has had three further prime ministers ([[Shinz<U+014D> Abe]], [[Yasuo Fukuda]] and [[Taro Aso]]) who have come to power without there being a general election.

On September 1, 2008, Yasuo Fukuda abruptly announced he was retiring as leader. Taro Aso won the subsequent [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election, 2008|LDP leadership election]], which was held on September 22, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/world/asia/23japan.html |title=Japanese Party Chooses Aso as Leader |date=2008-09-22 | work=The New York Times | first=Martin | last=Fackler | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref> Media sources speculated that, in the wake of a recent change in leadership, Prime Minister Taro Aso might call elections in late October or early November 2008 while his popularity was still high,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/2983677/Japanese-election-brought-forward.html |title=Japanese election brought forward |date=2008-09-18 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Julian | last=Ryall | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>

There were expectations that the steady decline and numerous scandals of the LDP might lead to the complete extinction of the party and the creation of a new political system, with actual ideologically coherent parties emerging instead of the current system of a shared interest in power with stark ideological differences.<ref>{{cite news |title=Japan's governing party faces political extinction |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/world/asia/20iht-20japan.20321139.html?scp=7&sq=japan%20scandal%20election%20parties%202009&st=cse |work= |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-05-11 | first=Martin | last=Fackler}}</ref>

In late June 2009, there were rumours of a planned election date in early August 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6687735.html |title=Report: Japan's PM eyes general election in early August <U+2013> People's Daily Online |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref> In [[Tokyo prefectural election, 2009|prefectural elections in Tokyo]], the LDP again lost a lot of seats and was for the first time since 1965 not the largest party in the prefectural assembly. The next day, Aso confirmed these rumours by calling for an election on August 30, 2009.<ref name="August"/>

As soon as the election was called, a campaign was underway by a group of LDP Diet Members to replace Aso as leader. Fully one third of the parliamentary party (including finance minister [[Kaoru Yosano]]) were reported to have signed a petition calling for an urgent party meeting to discuss the issue. The BBC reported LDP critics of Aso asserting that an election with him still as leader would be "political suicide".<ref name="BBC party rebels">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8153149.stm|title=Party rebels move on Japanese PM|publisher=BBC news website|date=2009-07-16|first=Roland|last=Buerk}}</ref> Prime Minister Aso dissolved the House of Representatives on July 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/07/21/world/international-us-japan-election.html?ref=global-home |title=Japanese Parliament Is Dissolved |date=2009-07-21 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2009-07-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> The official campaign started on August 18, 2009.<ref name="economist" >{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14258696 |title=Railing against the wrong enemy |publisher=The Economist |date=2009-08-20}}</ref>

Former LDP minister [[Yoshimi Watanabe]] announced the foundation of a new party, [[Your Party]], on August 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author=english@peopledaily.com.cn |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6719677.html |title=Japan's former minister to launch party to campaign in election |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>

=== Policy platforms ===
The DPJ's policy platforms include: a restructuring of civil service; a monthly allowance for families with children (at 26000 yen per child); a cut in the [[fuel tax]]; income support for farmers; free tuition for public high schools; the banning of [[temporary work]] in manufacturing<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/6098808/Japan-election-unemployed-turn-on-the-government.html |title=Japan election: unemployed turn on the government |date=2009-08-27 |publisher=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | first=Julian | last=Ryall | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>; raising the minimum wage to 1000 yen; and the halting of any increase in sales tax for the next four years.<ref name="economist" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/global/04yen.html |title=Opposition Woos Japan<U+2019>s Voters With Costly Vows |publisher=New York Times |date=2009-08-03 |author=Hiroko Tabuchi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE57L08020090822 |title=Japan opposition may score landslide win: media |date=2009-08-21 |publisher=Reuters | first=Chisa | last=Fujioka}}</ref>

The LDP's policy platforms are similar to the DPJ's. A [[New York Times]] article on August 28, 2009 noted both platforms offer little on economic policies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/29/world/asia/29japan.html?hp |title=Lost in Japan<U+2019>s Election Season: The Economy |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-08-29 | first=Martin | last=Fackler | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>

=== Pre-election polls ===
Before the dissolution of the lower house, National weekly magazines had been citing analysts predicting a big loss for the ruling coalition which held two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives. Some (e.g., [[Sh<U+016B>kan Gendai]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j-cast.com/2009/07/13045255.html |title=J-CAST<U+30CB><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+30B9> : <U+672A><U+3060><U+306B><U+300C><U+8996><U+754C><U+4E0D><U+826F><U+300D><U+9EBB><U+751F><U+653F><U+6A29> <U+515A><U+5185><U+306B><U+4E0D><U+7A4F><U+306A><U+52D5><U+304D> |publisher=J-cast.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>) warned that the LDP could lose as much as half of that. Many based their predictions on the low approval rating of  the Prime Minister Taro Aso and the devastating loss that the LDP suffered in the earlier prefectural election in Tokyo. On August 20 and 21, 2009, [[Asahi Shimbun]] and [[Yomiuri Shimbun]], leading national newspapers, and [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei Shimbun]], a financial daily, reported that the DPJ was poised to win over 300 of the 480 contested seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200908200184.html |title=Analysis: DPJ on pace to win 300 seats |date=2009-09-20 |publisher=Asahi Shimbun}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20090821TDY01304.htm |title=Survey: DPJ poised to win over 300 seats |date=2009-09-21 |publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nikkei.co.jp/news/seiji/20090822AT3S2001C20082009.html |title=<U+6C11><U+4E3B><U+3001><U+5727><U+52DD><U+306E><U+52E2><U+3044><U+3000>300<U+8B70><U+5E2D><U+8D85><U+304C><U+5F53><U+9078><U+570F><U+3000><U+8846><U+9662><U+9078><U+60C5><U+52E2><U+8ABF><U+67FB> |language=Japanese |date=2009-08-21 |publisher=Nikkei Shimbun}}</ref>

On August 22, 2009, [[Mainichi Shimbun]] went further to predict that the DPJ could win over 320 seats, meaning almost all DPJ candidates would win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090822p2a00m0na015000c.html |title=DPJ could win over 320 seats in Lower House race: Mainichi poll |date=2009-08-22 |publisher=Mainichi Shimbun}}</ref> Mainichi noted that the DPJ appeared to be doing well in the western part of Japan, a traditional stronghold of the LDP, and that the LDP could lose all of its single-member constituency seats in 15 prefectures, including [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mainichi.jp/select/today/news/20090822k0000m010150000c.html |title=<U+63FA><U+3089><U+3050><U+81EA><U+6C11><U+306E><U+7259><U+57CE> 15<U+9053><U+770C><U+5168><U+6557><U+304B> |language=Japanese |publisher=Mainichi Shimbun |date=2009-08-22}}</ref> Also, according to Mainichi, the [[Japanese Communist Party]] will probably retain its previous 9 seats, while the Komeito Party and the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] may lose some of their shares.

According to a poll conducted on August 22, 2009 by the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]], Japan's largest newspaper, 40 percent said they would vote for the DPJ, while 24 percent for the LDP.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=a.vXXcCG2pu4 |title=DPJ Leader Hatoyama Says Domestic Demand Priority |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2009-08-22}}</ref>

The DPJ swept the LDP from power in a massive landslide, winning 308 seats (out of a total of 480 seats), while the LDP won only 119 seats<ref name="BBC"/> - the worst defeat for a sitting government in modern Japanese history.  This was in marked contrast to the [[Japanese general election, 1993|1993 election]], the only other time the LDP has lost an election.  In that election, the LDP remained by far the largest party in the House with well over 200 seats, despite losing its majority.  However, in the 2009 election the LDP was nearly 200 seats behind the DPJ. Of 83 [[Koizumi Children]] who became new LDP representatives in 2005, only 10 were reelected.

The DPJ won a strong majority in the House of Representatives, thus virtually assuring that Hatoyama would be the next prime minister.  Under the Constitution, if the House of Representatives and the House of Councilors cannot agree on a choice for prime minister, the choice of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet.  Hatoyama was nominated as prime minister on September 16 and formally appointed later that day by [[Akihito|Emperor Akihito]].

However, the DPJ was just short of a majority in the House of Councillors, and fell just short of the 320 seats (a two-thirds majority) needed to override negative votes in the upper chamber.  Hatoyama was thus forced to form a coalition government with the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[People's New Party]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/national/news/20090822p2a00m0na013000c.html |title=Hatoyama says DPJ will form coalition even if party performs well in election |date=2009-08-22 |publisher=Mainichi}}</ref>
