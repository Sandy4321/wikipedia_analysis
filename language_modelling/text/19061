'''George Labram''' was an American engineer employed as Chief Mechanical Engineer at the [[De Beers]] diamond mines in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] during the [[Siege of Kimberley]].

==Early life==
Labram was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1859, but attended school at the [[Quincy Mine]] after his parents moved there around 1864.<ref name=Gardiner/>{{rp|255}}

==Career==
Labram started his working career at [[Samuel F. Hodge & Company]] in Detroit before moving to Chicago where he first worked at the MC Bullock Manufacturing Company and later at [[Fraser & Chalmers]]. From Chicago Labram moved to the [[Silver King Mine]] in Arizona and then became mechanical engineer on a smelter for [[Anaconda Copper]]. Following that Labram worked at [[Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company]] for a short period before moving to the [[Butte and Boston Consolidated Mining Company]] where he worked for about a year as engineer in charge of machinery before moving to Dakota to errect a tin mill.<ref name=AH1981/><ref name=Gardiner/>{{rp|255-256}} At the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893 Labram ran a machinery exhibition.<ref name=AH1981/>

In 1893 Labram was employed by the [[De Beers]] company in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] to build and manage a crushing mill.<ref name=AH1981>{{cite journal|last=Snow|first=Richard F.|title=George Labram|journal=[[American Heritage (magazine){{!}}American Heritage]]|year=1981|month=April/May|volume=32|issue=3|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/george-labram}}</ref>  In 1898 he was promoted to chief engineer.<ref name=AH1981/>  Under Labram's supervision as manager of the crushing plant, [[Fred Kirsten]] devised an automated diamond extraction process. Up to that time all diamonds were manually extracted by sight.<ref name="williams-378">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Gardner Fred|title=The diamond mines of South Africa; some account of their rise and development|publisher=Macmillan|year=1902|pages=378<U+2013>380|chapter=XIII -  Winning the diamonds|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/diamondminesofso00willrich#page/378/mode/1up|accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref><ref name=NGM-1906>{{cite book|title=The National geographic magazine|year=1906|page=354|url=http://archive.org/stream/nationalgeograp171906nati#page/354/mode/1up|chapter=The diamond mines of South Africa}}</ref>

==Second Boer War==
Labram assisted [[Robert Kekewich|Major General Robert George Kekewich]] in preparing Kimberley's defenses prior to the [[Siege of Kimberley|siege]]; including the construction of a {{convert|155|foot|adj=on}} watch tower, search lights and a telephone system.<ref>{{cite book|coauthors=James S.

Labram installed an emergency fresh-water supply system for the town and designed a bulk refrigeration plant for perishable foodstuffs,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=D.E.|date=1877-06-01|title=LONG CECIL The Gun made in Kimberley during the Siege|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=The South African Military History Society|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0026-4016|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol041dp.html|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref> specifically for the storage of meat from cattle that had to be slaughtered as they could no longer be let out for grazing.<ref name="MLR"/>

During the siege Labram also built two [[armoured train]]s,<ref>{{Internet Archive|cassellshistory00danegoog|Cassell's History of the Boer War, 1899-1902 by Richard Danes (1903), p. 438 (n454)}}</ref> manufactured munitions for the existing artillery available in the town, as well as a complete once-off gun affectionately named the [[Long Cecil]] after the chairman of De Beers, [[Cecil Rhodes]].<ref name="AHM">{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1981/3/1981_3_48.shtml|title=GEORGE LABRAM|last=Snow|first=Richard F. |publisher=[[American Heritage Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>
Many of the tools needed for the manufacture of the gun had to also be manufactured in the De Beers workshop.<ref name="Oliver">{{Internet Archive|besiegedbyboers00ashegoog|Besieged by the Boers; a diary of life and events in Kimberley during the siege, Ashe, E. Oliver, (Evelyn Oliver), 1900}}</ref>{{rp|112}} 

[[Long Cecil]] was rifled with a bore of {{convert|4.1|in}} capable of propelling a {{convert|28.5|lb}} shell over {{convert|6500|yards}}.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/details/besiegedbyboers00ashegoog|title=Besieged by the Boers; a diary of life and events in Kimberley during the siege (1900)|author=Ashe, E.

[[Image:George Labram's Room.jpg|thumb|George Labram's room in the Grand Hotel, Kimberley in which he was killed by a Boer shell]]
Labram was killed on 9 February 1900, less than a week before the siege was lifted, by a Boer shell that hit his room in the Grand Hotel on Market Square.<ref name="AHM"/><ref name="Oliver"/>{{rp|134}} Kekewich gave Labram a full military funeral, that was attended by thousands despite Boer shelling specifically targeting the procession.<ref name="Oliver"/>{{rp|199}}

De Beers provided well for Labram's widow and son after his death, with Mrs. Labram receiving $500 per year for the remainder of her life and their 13 year old son $1000 per year until he came of age.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00EFDE103DEE32A25757C0A9659C946097D6CF|title=De Beers Co. Pensions Mrs. Labram|date=1901-03-04|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>  Great Britain also granted Mrs. Labram a once-off sum of 1000 pounds for the services her husband rendered during the siege.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&entity=FRUS.FRUS1900.p0723&id=FRUS.FRUS1900&isize=M|title=The Marquis of Lansdowne to Mr. Choate - Foreign Office, December 13, 1900|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>

The importance of the role Labram played in the defence of Kimberley is probably best expressed in a letter from [[Robert Kekewich|Lieutenant-Colonel Robert George Kekewich]] to Mrs. Labram:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/FRUS/FRUS-idx?type=turn&entity=FRUS.FRUS1900.p0722&id=FRUS.FRUS1900&isize=M&q1=labram|title=Lieutenant-Colonel Kekewitch to Mrs. Labram|date=1900-02-12|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>

{{quote|Dear Madam: It was with great grief that I received the sad intelligence on February 9 that your husband, Mr. George Labram, has been killed by a Boer shell. I write to offer you and your son the deepest sympathy of my staff and myself in the severe loss you have sustained. Not only Kimberley, but the whole British nation, is to-day indebted to your late husband for the valuable assistance he afforded to the defenders of Kimberley during a siege extending nearly four months. Your late husband placed unreservedly at my disposal his great genius, and I can not sufficiently express my gratitude for the many works he completed, which have much assisted me to prolong the defense of Kimberley. I can assure you my dear madam, that the whole of Kimberley mourns the loss of our dear friend George Labram as we would the loss of a dear relative. Yours, sincerely,|KEKEWICH, Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding the Troops at Kimberley}}

The one request from the people of Kimberley that Labram was unable to deliver on was to produce some whiskey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1976/3/1976_3_20.shtml|title=Taking Sides in the Boer War|last=FARWELL |first=BYRON|publisher=American Heritage Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[File:Dead Memorial 008.jpg|thumb|Memorial to George Labram on the [[Honoured Dead Memorial]]]]
[[File:Long Cecil 003.jpg|thumb|[[Long Cecil]] on the [[Honoured Dead Memorial]]]]
The modern day suburb of Labram in Kimberley is named after George Labram.  The [[Honoured Dead Memorial]], which prominently features ''Long Cecil'' and a memorial plaque to George Labram on its [[stylobate]], is situated adjacent to the neighbourhood.

The memorial plaque reads
