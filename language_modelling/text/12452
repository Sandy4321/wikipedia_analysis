'''Maurice Clemmons''' (February 6, 1972 &ndash; December 1, 2009) was an American felon who was responsible for the November 29, 2009, [[Lakewood police officer shooting|murder of four police officers]] in [[Parkland, Washington]].<ref name="Naughton1130" /> After evading police for two days following the shooting, Clemmons was shot and killed by a [[Seattle Police Department|police officer]] in [[Seattle]].

Prior to his involvement in the shooting, Clemmons had at least five felony convictions in [[Arkansas]] and at least eight felony charges in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref name="Buck1130" /> His first incarceration began in 1989, at age 17. Facing sentences totaling 108 years in prison, the burglary sentences were reduced in 2000 by [[Governor of Arkansas]] [[Mike Huckabee]] to 47 years, which made him immediately eligible for parole. The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously moved to release him in 2000.

Clemmons was subsequently arrested on other charges and was jailed several times. In the months prior to the Parkland shooting, he was in jail on charges of [[assault]]ing a police officer and [[rape|raping]] a child. One week prior to the Parkland shooting, he was released from jail after posting a $150,000 [[bail bond]].

When she responded, "Well, why don't you just shoot?", he punched her in the head and ran off with the purse, which contained $16 and a credit card.<ref name="Brunner1130" />

Clemmons was accused multiple times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid it in his sock to use as a weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead.<ref name="ST1129" /><ref name="Brunner1130" /> Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him.<ref name="ST1129" /> At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.<ref name="Robinson1201">{{Cite news |last=Robinson |first=Sean |title=Clemmons deemed "dangerous" by psychologists |work=[[The News Tribune]] |date=2009-12-01 |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/293/story/975661.html?storylink=omni_popular |accessdate=2009-12-02}}</ref>

By 1990, Clemmons was sentenced to 108 years in prison for eight felony charges from his teenage years in Arkansas.

In 1999, after having served 10 years of his sentence, Clemmons filed a [[pardon|clemency]] appeal with Arkansas [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]].<ref name="Robinson1201" /> In his petition to Huckabee, Clemmons wrote he came from "a very good [[Christianity|Christian]] family" and was "raised much better than my actions speak".<ref name="Brunner1130" /><ref name="Murphy1201">{{Cite news |last=Murphy |first=Kim |title=Suspect in Seattle-area police slayings is shot and killed |work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-12-01 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-police-shooting2-2009dec02,0,7940378.story |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> Clemmons claimed he had just moved from [[Seattle]], Washington, to Arkansas as a teenager, and because he had no friends he gave in to peer pressure and "fell in with the wrong crowd" to be accepted by his young peers, which led him to commit his crimes.<ref name="Brunner1130" /><ref name="Robinson1201" /> Although he apologized for his actions, Clemmons also complained that he received overly harsh sentences. He also claimed to have changed and expressed regret that his mother had recently died without seeing him turn his life around. Clemmons' clemency application was supported by Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Marion Humphrey, who argued the cumulative sentence was excessive and cited Clemmons' young age at the time he committed the crimes.<ref name="Brunner1130" />

The decision was made over the objections of some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons' case.<ref name="ST1129" /><ref name="Brunner1130" /><ref name="Robinson1201" /><ref name="Egan1130">{{Cite news |last=Egan |first=Timothy |author-link=Timothy Egan |date=2009-11-30 |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Mike Huckabee's Burden |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/mike-huckabees-burden/ |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> Mark Fraiser, an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaksi County, argued Clemmons was extremely likely to commit further acts of violence in the future, and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder, "you've got to be a bad little dude".<ref name="Brunner1130 " /> On May 3, 2000, Huckabee commuted Clemmons' 108-year sentence to 47 years, 5 months and 19 days, which made him eligible for parole that day.<ref name="Brantley1130" /> As a factor in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons' age at the time the crimes were committed.<ref name="ST1129" /> The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons' release on July 13, 2000, and he was set free on August 1, 2000.<ref name="Brantley1130" /><ref name="Brunner1130 " />

==Later crimes==

In March 2001, Clemmons violated parole by committing aggravated robbery and theft again in [[Ouachita County, Arkansas|Ouachita County]]. He was convicted on July 13, 2001 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.<ref name="Brantley1130" /> He also faced charges of parole violations, but due to problems with the case, he was not served with the charges until 2004. His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped because so much time had passed, and they were subsequently dismissed.<ref name="Robinson1201" /> Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004. He told the parole board he was "not ready" the first time he was released, but that he "doesn't want to die in prison" and will "try to do the right thing".<ref name="Murphy1201" /> Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004 while still on parole, which was approved by Arkansas authorities.<ref name="Brunner1130" /> That year, he married a woman named Nicole Smith, although ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' later reported the relationship had "been tumultuous".<ref name="ST1129" /><ref name="Brunner1130" /><ref name="Perry1201">{{Cite news |last1=Perry |first1=Nick |last2=O'Hagan |first2=Maureen |last3=Armstrong |first3=Ken |title=Four days in May set stage for Sunday's tragedy |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2009-12-01 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010392869_shootingjustice01m.html |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> Clemmons was placed under the supervision of the [[Washington State Department of Corrections]] and classified as "high risk to reoffend". His supervision was to continue until October 2015. He lived in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], where he ran a landscaping and power-washing business out of his house.<ref name="ST1129" /> Over the next five years, Clemmons bought six houses, including one in Arkansas and five in Washington.<ref name="Robinson1201" />

Following his parole in 2004, Clemmons had no arrests or problems with the law until May 2009.<ref name="Robinson1201" /> ''The Seattle Times'' referred to four days in May 2009 as the time when "Maurice Clemmons' behavior and mental state deteriorated".<ref name="Perry1201"/> On May 9, a Pierce County sheriff's deputy responded to Clemmons' home after reports he was throwing rocks at houses, cars and people. When the deputy tried to enter the house, one of Clemmons' cousins grabbed his wrist. After a struggle, Clemmons emerged from the house and punched the deputy in the face, and assaulted a second deputy who arrived to help. Clemmons was placed under arrest and taken to Pierce County Jail, where he continued to struggle and told jail workers, "I'll kill all you bitches."<ref name="Robinson1201" /><ref name="Perry1201" /> He was charged with two felony assault charges and two felony malicious mischief charges, and released from jail the next day after posting a $40,000 bail bond without seeing a judge.<ref name="Perry1201" />

On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons appeared naked in his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife.<ref name="Perry1201" /> Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was [[Eve]].<ref name="Murphy1201" /><ref name="Perry1201" /> He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, at about 4 a.m. that same morning, Clemmons gathered his family back into the living room and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was "going to fly to [[heaven]]". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. [[Child Protective Services]] investigated and substantiated the [[sexual abuse]] complaint.<ref name="Perry1201" /> Latanya Clemmons, Maurice's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was "not in his right mind".<ref name="Murphy1201" />

Clemmons was arrested on July 1, 2009, after he appeared in a Pierce County court trying to have his [[bench warrant]] thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, as well as being a fugitive from Arkansas.<ref name="Perry1201" /> At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as "the beast". He also told a police officer that [[United States president|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[Lebron James]] were his brothers, and [[Oprah Winfrey]] was his sister.<ref name="Robinson1201" /> Pierce County prosecutors claimed Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the [[List of law enforcement agencies in Arkansas|Arkansas Department of Community Correction]] notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his [[extradition]] and that he should be [[adjudication|adjudicated]] on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, the less you want them in your community."<ref name="Perry1201" />

During a court-ordered mental health evaluation, Clemmons told psychologists he had experienced hallucinations in May 2009 of "people drinking blood and people eating babies, and lawless on the streets, like people were [[cannibalism|cannibals]]".<ref name="Robinson1201" /> He claimed the visions had since passed. He also claimed to have no faith in the American justice system and thought he was being "maliciously persecuted because I'm black and they believe the police".<ref name="Robinson1201" /> The evaluation, completed by two psychologists from the [[Western State Hospital (Washington State)|Western State Hospital]] on October 19, concluded Clemmons was dangerous and presented an increased risk of future criminal acts.<ref name="Robinson1201" /> Pierce County Judge John McCarthy set bail for Clemmons' assault charges at $40,000, below the $100,000 that prosecutors sought based on Clemmons' history of violence. Pierce County Judge Thomas Felnagle set bail for the child-rape charges at $150,000, lower than the $200,000 sought by prosecutors,<ref name="Perry1201" /> but higher than usual for the charges.<ref name="Brunner1130" /><ref name="Robinson1201" /> After a mental evaluation, a psychologist concluded Clemmons was competent to stand trial on the charges, which eliminated him as a candidate for involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an [[insanity defense|insanity]] or [[Diminished responsibility|diminished-capacity defense]].<ref name="ST1129" /><ref name="Robinson1201" /> On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a [[Chehalis, Washington|Chehalis]]-based company, to secure his release.<ref name="ST1129" /><ref name="Perry1201" /> Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.<ref name="Perry1201" />

He told the men he had twice tried to go to a Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting.

He also talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.<ref name="MartinArmstrong" />

On the morning of November 29, Clemmons drove a white pickup truck to Allen's home, then Allen drove him past the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop in [[Parkland, Washington|Lakewood]], a suburb of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]]. After they saw marked police patrol cars in the parking lot, Allen drove back past the coffee shop and parked nearby. Some reports from witnesses said Clemmons parked his truck in a car wash stall at the coffee shop and pretended to clean the vehicle, but never turned the hose on.<ref name="Lynn0303" /><ref name="SPI0302" /> Around 8 a.m, Clemmons walked into the Forza Coffee Co. coffee shop, where four police officers were working on laptops before their shift.

Clemmons went back to his house and told Hinton he had been shot by police, and Hinton allegedly gave Eddie and Douglas Davis brothers a car to "get Clemmons out of here".

Coffee shop employees who witnessed the shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter from a series of photos.<ref name="Netter1202" /> Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest.<ref name="Johnson1201">{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Gene |title=Seattle police kill suspect in officer slayings |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-12-01}}</ref> Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him.<ref name="Murphy1201" /><ref name="Netter1202" /> After receiving what they later learned was a false tip, police locked down a [[Leschi, Seattle]] neighborhood house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside.

Around 2:45 a.m., Officer Kelly, age 39, was on patrol and stopped to investigate a broken-down car on the side of the road, which was idling with its hood up. Officer Kelly recognized the vehicle as having been reported stolen. While sitting in his patrol car and writing a report, Officer Kelly noticed Clemmons approaching him, and recognized him as the suspect in the Lakewood shooting. Officer Kelly ordered him to stop and show his hands, but he instead began to flee around the disabled vehicle.<ref name="Murphy1201" /><ref name="Netter1202" /><ref name="Johnson1201" /><ref name="Sullivan1201" /> Police claim that Clemmons reached into his waist area, for a gun. Officer Kelly fired several rounds at Clemmons and hit him at least twice, killing him.<ref name="Netter1202" /><ref name="Johnson1201" /><ref name="Gene1202" /><ref name="Miletich1202" /> Clemmons was carrying a handgun that had belonged to Lakewood Officer Greg Richards. Officer Kelly was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting.<ref name="Sullivan1201" /> Police later said Clemmons would have eventually died from the gunshot wound he sustained at the Lakewood shooting.<ref name="clemmonsdead121" />

Since his death, multiple people have been arrested for helping Clemmons during and after the Lakewood shooting. Authorities claim the accomplices misled police about his whereabouts, gave him cell phones and money, applied first aid to his gunshot wounds and tried to help him leave the state.<ref name="Murphy1201" /><ref name="Sullivan1201" /><ref name="Gene1202" /> Among those arrested were Clemmons' sister, who bandaged his wounds and provided him transportation.<ref name="Gene1202" /><ref name="CBS1202" /> Authorities arrested five other people for assisting Clemmons: Letricia Nelson, Quiana Williams, Douglas Davis, Eddie Davis, and Ricky Hinton.<ref name="Netter1202">{{Cite news |last=Netter |first=Sarah |title=Helping a Cop Killer: Maurice Clemmons' Friends, Family Busted |date=2009-12-02 |work=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/US/hunting-washington-cop-killer-maurice-clemmons/story?id=9226301 |accessdate=2009-12-20}}</ref> Darcus Allen was arrested and charged with aggravated first-degree murder for his alleged role as Clemmons' getaway driver.

A cell phone photograph taken of Clemmons' shirtless dead body quickly spread among city residents and government employees, prompting questions over who took it and how it became circulated. If the photo was leaked by an employee of the city or emergency responder, the action may possibly violate their employment contract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Jennifer |work=[[Seattle Times]] |date=2009-12-02 |title=Authorities investigate who leaked photo of Clemmons' body |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010410146_shootingphoto03m.html |accessdate=2010-03-22}}</ref> Funeral arrangements were kept private by the family due to the circumstances of his crime.<ref name="STimes1206" />
