"'''I Miss You'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]], taken from her fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles album)|4]]'' (2011). It was written by Knowles, [[Frank Ocean]] and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Knowles and Taylor. The song's development was motivated the fact that Knowles wanted to focus on songs being classics, songs that would last, and songs that she could sing when she becomes old. A mid-paced [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[Ballad (music)|ballad]], "I Miss You" is influenced by the ballads of the 1980s. Its [[instrumentation]] consists essentially of [[synthesizers]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]. "I Miss You" finds Knowles, as the protagonist, thinking deeply over her relationship with her love interest from whom she parted; however, she still pins for him and feels self-conscious for doing so.

"I Miss You" was generally well-received by [[music critics]] who complimented its very sparse production as well as its aurally remarkable 1980s influence. Some of them also described the song as "haunting" and called it the highlight of the record. Critics also complimented how Knowles' vocals keep on alternating from desperate and calm throughout the song. Following the release of ''4'' in early July 2011, "I Miss You" charted at number 184 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and at number 34 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korea Gaon International Singles Chart]]. The song was part of Knowles' [[set list]] for her ''[[4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'', held in [[Roseland Ballroom]], New York City in August 2011.

==Background and development==
[[File:Frank Ocean.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Frank Ocean (''pictured'') wrote "I Miss You".]]
"I Miss You" was written by Knowles, [[OFWGKTA|Odd Future]] band member [[Frank Ocean]], and Shea Taylor while production was handled by Knowles and Taylor themselves.<ref name="booklet">{{cite album-notes |title=4 |artist=[[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] |year=2011 |url=http://www.beyonceonline.com/us/albumcredits |publisher=[[Columbia Records]]}}</ref> In early March 2011, Ocean made known that Knowles was back in the studio working on her then upcoming fourth studio album, ''[[4 (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles album)|4]]''. Ocean posted a snap of Knowles in his studio on [[Twitter]], fuelling reports that he had worked with Knowles on the new record. As well as posting a picture of Knowles recording new material, he also accompanied the image with the comment: "This is the room i am working in this day. not to brag but man, this is surreal. like [...] she is singing my songs. If time were to stop right now, the past couple weeks would be near the top of the highlight reel for my short time on earth [sic]."<ref name="rapocean">{{cite web| url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/03/12/beyonce-dives-into-studio-with-frank-ocean/ |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> Dives Into Studio with Frank Ocean |work=[[Rap-Up]] |publisher=Devin Lazerine |date=March 12, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

David Amidon of [[PopMatters]] who stated that "[[1+1 (song)|1+1]] provides Knowles a song that "can compete with the favorites of this generation<U+2019>s parents", came to the conclusion that "1+1" and "I Miss You" are "equally competent, if safer, attempts at the same formula."

Take the standout track on her new album, ''4'', 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band [[The xx]] by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/06/album-review-beyonces-4.html| title=Album review: Beyonce's ''4''|first=Roberts |last=Randall|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Eddy Hartenstein.

He considered the song to be "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R&B equivalent of [[Ariel Pink]]'s hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it."<ref name="guardian1">{{cite web|first=Alexis |last=Petridis |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/23/beyonce-4-album-review |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: 4 - review &#124; Music |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>
