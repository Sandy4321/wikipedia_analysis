'''''Dungeon Siege''''' is a  [[computer role-playing game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Gas Powered Games]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Microsoft Game Studios]]. [[Chris Taylor (game designer)|Chris Taylor]] (from ''[[Total Annihilation]]'') showed ''Dungeon Siege'' years in production for the first time at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3 2000]]. The game was [[2002 in video gaming|released in 2002]] and later bundled with the [[Radeon R420|X800]] line of video cards in 2005.

In November 2003, Gas Powered Games and [[Rockstar New England|Mad Doc Software]] developed an official standalone [[expansion pack]] for the game called ''[[Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna]]''. It includes the original game.

==Introduction==
The player participates in a [[quest]] to save the land of Ehb from the forces of evil. The player follows the main character from their humble beginnings as a [[farmer]] to their ultimate destiny as a powerful [[hero]] or heroine. As the game progresses, the main character may be joined by other adventurers, whom the player also controls. The background is based in a fantasy [[Middle Ages|medieval]] world with [[Geography|geographic]] variety in open and closed environments ([[dungeon]]s). The graphics are mildly detailed with environment changes.

Aranna is the continent upon which the games of the ''Dungeon Siege'' series take place. The Kingdom of Ehb is at the western edge of the continent. ''Dungeon Siege'' and its expansion pack ''Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna'' take place in and around the Kingdom of Ehb.

==Story==
In the Kingdom of Ehb, a humble farmer's life is turned upside down when a small band of evil [[goblin]]-like creatures attack the community. The Krug, as they are known, must be stopped and the player's character is tasked with seeking help from the neighboring town of Stonebridge. Along the way, the player may meet others willing to help them in their quest. The player soon discovers, however, that their story does not end upon reaching Stonebridge.

According to the game's back-story, The Kingdom of Ehb is a border [[monarchy|kingdom]] in the continent of Aranna, next to the Plain of Tears. Originally a trading post on the outskirts of the Empire of Stars, Ehb later achieved temporary status as a military [[protectorate]] and [[province]] when the 10th Legion migrated westward.

In the wake of the War of Legions, and the ensuing collapse of the Empire of Stars, Ehb became an [[independence|independent]] kingdom in its own right. Stability was achieved thanks to the protection provided by its fortifications and the 10th Legion&nbsp;<U+2014> one of the most highly trained [[army|armies]] of Aranna.

Ehb presents a rich variety of [[terrain]]s and [[person|peoples]] for players to interact with. [[Valley]]s, icy [[mountain]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[desert]]s, deep [[forest]]s, [[cliff]]s and [[volcano]]es adorn its layout. Its main inhabitants are [[Human]]s and [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarves]] who live in harmony and acknowledge the same ruler. Players will also encounter the primitive Krug, the secretive [[Goblin]] technologists, the loathsome [[undead]] and the mysterious, though largely autonomous, Droog. The player's final objective is to defeat Gom, the leader of the Seck, a race of mysterious, spiteful monsters.

==Gameplay==
The [[gameplay]] is a mixture of pause-and-go tactical management and point-and-click action. The mechanic is highly similar to that of latter ''[[Ultima (video game series)|Ultima]]'' games (so much so that fans have recreated certain ''Ultima'' titles using the ''Dungeon Siege'' engine), and to a lesser degree, action RPGs like ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' or early [[action role-playing game]]s like ''[[Nox (video game)|Nox]]''. The ''Dungeon Siege'' quest is highly [[Linearity (video games)|linear]] and involves constant [[hack and slash]] battle, similar in some ways to [[Platform game|platform]] and [[beat 'em up]] games.

The game uses a display engine that makes the entire experience seamless, with no load screens. The interface is completely scripted with a programming language called 'scrit'{{Fact|date=July 2008}} and the development of its expertise is called 'scrit-foo.' This scripting system allowed for many "siegelet" add-ons, which modified game play.

The party system is automated but efficient with basic formations, resources, and action-response. In addition to being able to recruit [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) that function much like the player's own character, it is possible to buy a [[mule]] to help carry more items as a member of the group. Players can recruit and disband party members, but must retain at least one party member at all times.

''Dungeon Siege'' supports [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] cooperative gaming over [[Local area network|LAN]]s and the [[Internet]] (direct [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] connection, as well as ZoneMatch).

==Music==
''Dungeon Siege'' features an orchestral soundtrack by award-winning composer [[Jeremy Soule]]. Soule also scored ''[[Dungeon Siege II]]''.

==Bonus packs==
Gas Powered Games released two promotional mods labeled as "bonus packs":

; ''Yesterhaven'': ''Yesterhaven'' is a multiplayer short story that can only be played [[Online and offline|online]]. It does not require a pre-existing character, nor any previous experience with ''Dungeon Siege''. This bonus pack can be downloaded from [http://www.gaspowered.com/ds1/content.php?loc=downloads Gas Powered Games] and requires the original ''Dungeon Siege''. The monsters in ''Yesterhaven'' are relatively weak, posing a challenge only to beginning characters. The story revolves around a single town that undergoes three "plagues" during the early years of Ehb, reusing many of the monster types found in the original game with new settings.

; ''Return to Arhok'': ''Return to Arhok'' continues the story of ''Legends of Aranna'' and requires both the expansion and [[Windows XP]] to run.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/dungeonsiegeloa/xpextra.aspx |title=Microsoft Game Studios&nbsp;<U+2014> Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> It is also called ''XP Level''. However, some users who have Windows Vista could play the expansion, only with the warning that there would be some minor incompatibilities with the OS.

==Mods==
The game engine allows content creation and modification through a released toolkit. New content and modifications are called [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] or siegelets. There are many mods created by amateurs available for download on the internet, with features ranging from new graphics to completely new character development systems.

==Legacy==
A sequel, ''[[Dungeon Siege II]]'', was released in 2005. In March 2006, [[Take-Two Interactive]] acquired all publishing rights to ''Dungeon Siege'', ending the four-year partnership between Microsoft and Gas Powered Games. In October 2006, ''[[Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony]]'' was released for the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]], considered to be the third episode in the series storyline.

A movie based on the game, ''[[In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale]]'', was released January 11, 2008. It was directed by 
[[Uwe Boll]].

In June, 2008, Chris Taylor announced to Euro-Gamer that ''[[Dungeon Siege III]]'' was 'in the works' and would focus on a single player character rather than a group.
