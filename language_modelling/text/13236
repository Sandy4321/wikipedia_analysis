'''George IV''' (George Augustus Frederick; 12 August 1762 <U+2013> 26 June 1830) was the King of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and also of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] from the death of his father, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], on 29 January 1820 until his own death ten years later. From 1811 until his accession, he served as [[Prince Regent]] during his father's relapse into mental illness.

George IV led an extravagant lifestyle that contributed to the fashions of the [[British Regency]]. He was a patron of new forms of leisure, style and taste. He commissioned [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to build the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]] and remodel [[Buckingham Palace]], and Sir [[Jeffry Wyatville]] to rebuild [[Windsor Castle]]. He was instrumental in the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London]] and [[King's College London]].

He had a poor relationship with both his father and his wife, [[Caroline of Brunswick]], whom he even forbade to attend his coronation. He introduced the unpopular [[Pains and Penalties Bill]] in a desperate, unsuccessful, attempt to divorce his wife.

For most of George's regency and reign, [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] controlled the government as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. George's governments, with little help from the King, presided over victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. He had to accept [[George Canning]] as foreign minister and later prime minister, and drop his opposition to [[Catholic Emancipation]].

His charm and culture earned him the title "the first gentleman of England", but his bad relations with his father and wife, and his dissolute way of life earned him the contempt of the people and dimmed the prestige of the monarchy. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending in time of war. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor a role model for his people. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable, and irresponsible. At all times he was much under the influence of favourites.<ref>Kenneth Baker, "George IV: a Sketch." ''History Today'' 2005 55(10): 30<U+2013>36</ref>

==Early life==
George was born at [[St James's Palace]], London, on 12 August 1762. As the eldest son of a British sovereign, he automatically became [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth; he was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] a few days afterwards.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.1</ref> On 18 September of the same year, he was baptised by [[Thomas Secker]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p.2</ref> His godparents were the [[Adolf Friedrich IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (his maternal uncle, for whom [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|the Duke of Devonshire]], [[Lord Chamberlain]], stood proxy), [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|the Duke of Cumberland]] (his twice-paternal great-uncle), and [[Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|the Dowager Princess of Wales]] (his paternal grandmother).<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Prince of Wales 1762<U+2013>1811'', p.2</ref> George was a talented student, quickly learning to speak French, German and Italian in addition to his native English.<ref name="dnb">{{Cite journal |last=Hibbert |first=Christopher |title=George IV (1762<U+2013>1830) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

At the age of 18 he was given a separate establishment, and in dramatic contrast with his prosaic, scandal-free father threw himself with zest into a life of dissipation and wild extravagance involving heavy drinking and numerous mistresses and escapades. He was a witty conversationalist, drunk or sober, and showed good, but grossly expensive, taste in decorating his palace.  This was particularly in poor judgement in light of the extraordinary poverty of many London residents including large numbers of children and adults living on the streets with no hope of shelter,  freezing to death in winter or dying of starvation.

The Prince turned 21 in 1783, and obtained a grant of <U+00A3>60,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1783|r=-3}}}} today) from Parliament and an annual income of <U+00A3>50,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|50000|1783|r=-3}}}} today) from his father. It was far too little for his needs. (The stables alone cost <U+00A3>31,000 a year.) He then established his residence in [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], where he lived a profligate life.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp.25<U+2013>28</ref> Animosity developed between the Prince and his father, who desired more frugal behaviour on the part of the [[heir-apparent]]. The King, a political conservative, was also alienated by the Prince's adherence to [[Charles James Fox]] and other radically inclined politicians.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.48</ref>
[[Image:GeorgeIV1780.jpg|thumb|left|200px|George as Prince of Wales, painted by [[Richard Cosway]], ca. 1780<U+2013>1782.]]

Soon after he reached the age of 21, the Prince became infatuated with [[Maria Fitzherbert]]. She was a commoner, six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.33</ref> Despite her complete unsuitability, the Prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], which prohibited his marriage without the consent of the King, which would never have been granted.

Nevertheless, the couple contracted a marriage on 15 December 1785 at her house in Park Street, [[Mayfair]]. Legally the union was void, as the King's consent was not granted (and never even requested).<ref>Smith, E. A., pp.36<U+2013>38</ref> However, Mrs. Fitzherbert believed that she was the Prince's [[Canon law|canonical]] and true wife, holding the law of the Church to be superior to the law of the State. For political reasons, the union remained secret and Mrs. Fitzherbert promised not to reveal it.<ref>David, pp.57<U+2013>91</ref>

The Prince was plunged into debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, forcing him to quit Carlton House and live at Mrs. Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the Prince's political allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The Prince's relationship with Mrs. Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the Prince's authority, the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny.<ref name="vol3">{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 3 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1914 | pages =396<U+2013>397 }}</ref> Mrs. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public denial of the marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the Prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the Prince <U+00A3>161,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|161000|1787|r=-3}}}} today) to pay his debts and <U+00A3>60,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1787|r=-3}}}} today) for improvements to Carlton House.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>De-la-Noy, p.31</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Marilyn Morris, "Princely Debt, Public Credit, and Commercial Values in Late Georgian Britain." ''Journal of British Studies'' 2004 43(3): 339<U+2013>365</ref>

==Regency crisis of 1788==
[[Image:GeorgeIV1785.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Portrait of George published by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1785.]]
It is now conjectured that King George III suffered from the hereditary disease [[porphyria]].<ref>{{cite book | last = R<U+00F6>hl | first= J. C. G. | coauthors = Warren, M.; Hunt, D. | title = Purple Secret| publisher=Bantam Press | year = 1998 }}</ref> In the summer of 1788 his mental health deteriorated, but he was nonetheless able to discharge some of his duties and to declare Parliament [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] from 25 September to 20 November. During the prorogation George III became deranged, posing a threat to his own life, and when Parliament reconvened in November the King could not deliver the customary [[Speech from the Throne]] during the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. Parliament found itself in an untenable position; according to long-established law it could not proceed to any business until the delivery of the King's Speech at a State Opening.<ref name="vol3" /><ref name="david1">David, pp.92<U+2013>119</ref>

Although arguably barred from doing so, Parliament began debating a Regency. In the House of Commons, Charles James Fox declared his opinion that the Prince of Wales was automatically entitled to exercise sovereignty during the King's incapacity. A contrasting opinion was held by the Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger]], who argued that, in the absence of a statute to the contrary, the right to choose a Regent belonged to Parliament alone.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.54</ref> He even stated that, without parliamentary authority "the Prince of Wales had no more right...to assume the government, than any other individual subject of the country."<ref>Derry, p.71</ref> Though disagreeing on the principle underlying a Regency, Pitt agreed with Fox that the Prince of Wales would be the most convenient choice for a Regent.<ref name="vol3" /><ref name="david1" />
[[Image:GeorgeIV1792.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Miniature of George by [[Richard Cosway]] (1792).]]
The Prince of Wales<U+2014>though offended by Pitt's boldness<U+2014>did not lend his full support to Fox's approach. The prince's brother, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York]], declared that the prince would not attempt to exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament.<ref>Derry, p.91</ref> Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the Regency, suggesting that the powers of the Prince of Wales be greatly limited. Among other things, the Prince of Wales would not be able either to sell the King's property or to grant a [[peerage]] to anyone other than a child of the King. The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme, declaring it a "project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs."<ref name="may">{{cite book|last=May|first=Thomas Erskine|authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|title=The Constitutional History of England Since the Accession of George the Third, 1760<U+2013>1860|year=1896|edition=11th|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co|location=London|pages=chapter III pp.184<U+2013>95|nopp=true}}</ref> In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.<ref name="david1" />

A significant technical impediment to any Regency Bill involved the lack of a Speech from the Throne, which was necessary before Parliament could proceed to any debates or votes. The Speech was normally delivered by the King, but could also be delivered by royal representatives known as [[Lords Commissioners]]; but no document could empower the Lords Commissioners to act unless the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] was affixed to it. The Seal could not be legally affixed without the prior authorisation of the Sovereign. Pitt and his fellow ministers ignored the last requirement and instructed the [[Lord Chancellor]] to affix the Great Seal without the King's consent, as the act of affixing the Great Seal in itself gave legal force to the Bill. This [[legal fiction]] was denounced by [[Edmund Burke]] as a "glaring falsehood",<ref name="derry">Derry, p.109</ref> as a "palpable absurdity",<ref name="derry" /> and even as a "forgery, fraud".<ref>Derry, p.181</ref> The Prince of Wales's brother, the Duke of York, described the plan as "unconstitutional and illegal."<ref name="may" /> Nevertheless, others in Parliament felt that such a scheme was necessary to preserve an effective government. Consequently on 3 February 1789, more than two months after it had convened, Parliament was formally opened by an "illegal" group of Lords Commissioners. The Regency Bill was introduced, but before it could be passed the King recovered. The King declared retroactively that the instrument authorising the Lords Commissioners to act was valid.<ref name="vol3" /><ref name="david1" />

==Marriage and mistresses==
[[Image:GeorgeIV1798.jpg|thumb|left|150px|George in 1798, after a painting by [[William Beechey|Sir William Beechey]].]]
The Prince of Wales's debts continued to climb, and his father refused to aid him unless he married his cousin Princess [[Caroline of Brunswick]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p.70</ref> In 1795, the Prince of Wales acquiesced, and they were married on 8 April 1795 at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St James's Palace]]. The marriage, however, was disastrous; each party was unsuited to the other. The two were formally separated after the birth of their only child, [[Charlotte Augusta|Princess Charlotte]], in 1796, and remained separated thereafter. The Prince of Wales remained attached to [[Maria Fitzherbert|Mrs. Fitzherbert]] for the rest of his life, despite several periods of estrangement.<ref name="david2">David, pp.150<U+2013>205</ref>

George's mistresses included [[Mary Robinson (poet)|Mary Robinson]], an actress who was bought off with a generous pension when she threatened to sell his letters to the newspapers;<ref>Parissien, p.60</ref> [[Grace Elliott]], the divorced wife of a physician;<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Prince of Wales 1762<U+2013>1811'', p.18</ref> and [[Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey]], who dominated his life for some years.<ref name="david2" /> In later life, his mistresses were the [[Isabella Seymour-Conway, Marchioness of Hertford|Marchioness of Hertford]] and the [[Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham|Marchioness Conyngham]], who were both married to aristocrats.<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p.214</ref>

George may have fathered several illegitimate children. James Ord (born 1786)<U+2014>who moved to the United States and became a Jesuit priest<U+2014>was reportedly his son by Mrs. Fitzherbert.<ref>David, pp.76<U+2013>78</ref> The King, late in life, told a friend that he had a son who was a naval officer in the West Indies, whose identity has been tentatively established as Capt. Henry A. F. Hervey (1786<U+2013>1824), reportedly George's child by the songwriter [[Lady Anne Barnard|Lady Anne Lindsay (later Barnard)]], a daughter of the [[James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres|5th Earl of Balcarres]].<ref>David, p.78</ref> Other reported offspring include Major G. S. Crole, the son of theatre manager's daughter Eliza Crole or Fox; William Hampshire, the son of publican's daughter Sarah Brown; and Charles "Beau" Candy, the son of a Frenchwoman with that surname.<ref>David, p. 80</ref> Anthony Camp, Director of Research at the [[Society of Genealogists]], has dismissed the claims that George IV was the father of Ord, Hervey, Hampshire and Candy as fictitious.<ref>Camp, Anthony J. (2007) ''Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction 1714<U+2013>1936'', ISBN 978-0-9503308-2-2</ref>

The problem of the Prince of Wales's debts, which amounted to the extraordinary sum of <U+00A3>630,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|630000|1795|r=-3}}}} today) in 1795,<ref>De-la-Noy, p.55</ref> was solved (at least temporarily) by Parliament. Being unwilling to make an outright grant to relieve these debts, it provided him an additional sum of <U+00A3>65,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|65000|1795|r=-3}}}} today) per annum.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.97</ref> In 1803, a further <U+00A3>60,000 (equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60000|1803|r=-3}}}} today) was added, and the Prince of Wales's debts of 1795 were finally cleared in 1806, although the debts he had incurred since 1795 remained.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>Smith (2001) p.92</ref>

In 1804 a dispute arose over the custody of Princess Charlotte, which led to her being placed in the care of the King, George III. It also led to a Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry into Princess Caroline's conduct after the Prince of Wales accused her of having an illegitimate son. The investigation cleared Caroline of the charge but still revealed her behaviour to be extraordinarily indiscreet.<ref>{{cite book | last =Ashley| first =Mike | title = The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens | publisher=Robinson| year =1998 | location =London | pages =684| isbn= 1-84119-096-9}}</ref>

==Regency==
{{Main|British Regency}}
In late 1810, George III was once again overcome by his malady following the death of his youngest daughter, [[Princess Amelia of the United Kingdom|Princess Amelia]]. Parliament agreed to follow the precedent of 1788; without the King's consent, the Lord Chancellor affixed the Great Seal of the Realm to [[letters patent]] naming Lords Commissioners. The Lords Commissioners, in the name of the King, signified the granting of the [[Royal Assent]] to a bill that became the [[Regency Acts#Care of King During his Illness.2C etc. Act 1811|Regency Act of 1811]]. Parliament restricted some of the powers of the Prince Regent (as the Prince of Wales became known). The constraints expired one year after the passage of the Act.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | pages = 50 }}</ref> The Prince of Wales became Prince Regent on 5 February 1811.<ref name="c4">{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/n-s/princeregent.html |title=The Prince Regent and His Circle: In their own words|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=2 August 2007}}</ref>

The Regent let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The principle that the crown accepts as prime minister the person who controls a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours him or not, became established.<ref>Bagehot, Walter (1872) ''The English constitution'', p. 247</ref> His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned [[Catholic Emancipation|Catholic emancipation]], the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, [[Spencer Perceval]], were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville]]. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs in office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.<ref>Parissien, p.185</ref>
[[Image:George IV bust1.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Prince Regent by [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]], c. 1814.]]
In 1812, when it appeared highly unlikely that the King would recover, the Prince of Wales again failed to appoint a new Whig administration. Instead, he asked the Whigs to join the existing ministry under Spencer Perceval. The Whigs, however, refused to co-operate because of disagreements over Catholic emancipation. Grudgingly, the Prince of Wales allowed Perceval to continue as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp.141<U+2013>2</ref>

On 10 May 1812, Spencer Perceval was assassinated by [[John Bellingham]]. The Prince Regent was prepared to reappoint all the members of the Perceval ministry under a new leader. The House of Commons formally declared its desire for a "strong and efficient administration",<ref>Smith, E. A., p.144</ref> so the Prince Regent then offered leadership of the government to [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], and afterwards to [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Earl of Moira]]. He doomed the attempts of both to failure, however, by forcing each to construct a bipartisan ministry at a time when neither party wished to share power with the other. Possibly using the failure of the two peers as a pretext, the Prince Regent immediately reappointed the Perceval administration, with [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool]], as Prime Minister.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.145</ref>
[[Image:Thomas Lawrence - The Prince Regent.jpg|thumb|left|175px|George as Prince Regent, in the robes of the [[Order of the Garter]]. Painting by [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]] (1816).]]
The Tories, unlike Whigs such as [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]], sought to continue the vigorous prosecution of the war in Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]].<ref>Smith, E. A., p.146</ref> An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, [[Prussia]], Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent [[Congress of Vienna]], it was decided that the [[Electorate of Hanover]], a state that had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to a Kingdom, known as the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], brother of Marquess Wellesley. That same year the [[War of 1812|British-American War of 1812]] came to an end, with neither side victorious.

During this period George took an active interest in matters of style and taste, and his associates such as the dandy [[Beau Brummell]] and the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] created the [[Regency style]]. In London Nash designed the Regency terraces of [[Regent's Park]] and [[Regent Street]]. George took up the new idea of the seaside spa and had the [[Brighton Pavilion]] developed as a fantastical seaside palace, adapted by Nash in the "Indian Gothic" style inspired loosely by the [[Taj Mahal]], with extravagant "Indian" and "Chinese" interiors.<ref>{{cite book | last =Rutherford | first =Jessica M.

==Reign==
[[Image:George IV coronation banquet.jpg|thumb|The coronation banquet for George IV was held at Westminster Hall on 19 July 1821.]]

When George III died in 1820, the Prince Regent ascended the throne as George IV, with no real change in his powers.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | pages = 81 }}</ref> By the time of his accession, he was obese and possibly addicted to [[laudanum]].<ref name="dnb" />

George IV's relationship with his wife [[Caroline of Brunswick|Caroline]] had deteriorated by the time of his accession. They had lived separately since 1796, and both were having affairs. In 1814, Caroline left the United Kingdom for continental Europe, but she chose to return for her husband's coronation, and to publicly assert her rights as Queen Consort. However, George IV refused to recognise Caroline as Queen, and commanded British ambassadors to ensure that monarchs in foreign courts did the same. By royal command, Caroline's name was omitted from the [[Book of Common Prayer]], the [[liturgy]] of the [[Church of England]]. The King sought a divorce, but his advisors suggested that any divorce proceedings might involve the publication of details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured the introduction of the [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]], under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his wife from his coronation at [[Westminster Abbey]], on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | pages = 82 }}</ref>
[[Image:George IV. of the United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|left|175px|George, ca. 1822, by [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Sir Thomas Lawrence]].]]
George's coronation was a magnificent and expensive affair, costing about <U+00A3>243,000 (approximately <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|243000|1822|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-3}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} (for comparison, his father's coronation had only cost about <U+00A3>10,000, equal to <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10000|1760|r=-3}}}} today). Despite the enormous cost, it was a popular event.<ref name="dnb" /> In 1821 the King became the first monarch to pay a state visit to Ireland since [[Richard II of England]].<ref>De-la-Noy, p.95</ref> The following year he visited [[Edinburgh]] for "one and twenty daft days."<ref>{{cite book |title=The King's Jaunt: George IV in Scotland, 1822|first=John |last=Prebble |publisher=Birlinn Limited|location=Edinburgh |year=2000|isbn=1-84158-068-6 }}</ref> His [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland|visit to Scotland]], organised by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], was the first by a reigning British monarch since the mid-17th century.

George IV spent most of his later reign in seclusion at [[Windsor Castle]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHanoverians/GeorgeIV.aspx|title=George IV|publisher=The official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref> but he continued to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support [[Catholic Emancipation]], as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public.<ref>Parissien, p.189</ref> Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures.<ref>Smith, E. A., p.238</ref> The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory [[George Canning]]. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration to the effect that his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p.292</ref>

Canning's views on the Catholic Question were not well received by the most conservative Tories, including the Duke of Wellington. As a result the ministry was forced to include Whigs.<ref>Smith, E. A., pp.231<U+2013>4</ref> Canning died later in that year, leaving [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich]] to lead the tenuous Tory-Whig coalition. Lord Goderich left office in 1828, to be succeeded by the Duke of Wellington, who had by that time accepted that the denial of some measure of relief to Roman Catholics was politically untenable.<ref>Parissien, p.190</ref><ref>Smith, E. A., p.237</ref> With great difficulty Wellington obtained the King's consent to the introduction of a Catholic Relief Bill on 29 January 1829. Under pressure from his fanatically anti-Catholic brother, the [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Duke of Cumberland]], the King withdrew his approval and in protest the Cabinet resigned ''en masse'' on 4 March. The next day the King, now under intense political pressure, reluctantly agreed to the Bill and the ministry remained in power.<ref name="dnb" /> Royal Assent was finally granted to the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Act]] on 13 April.<ref>Parissien, p.381</ref>

[[Image:George4coin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Half-Crown of George IV, 1821. The inscription reads ''GEORGIUS IIII D[ei] G[ratia] BRITANNIAR[um] REX F[idei] D[efensor]'' (George IV, by the grace of God King of the Britains (British kingdoms), Defender of the Faith). George IV was the last British King to be shown on coins wearing a Roman-style laurel wreath.]]

George IV's heavy drinking and indulgent lifestyle had taken their toll of his health by the late 1820s. His taste for huge banquets and copious amounts of alcohol caused him to become obese, making him the target of ridicule on the rare occasions that he did appear in public.<ref>Parissien, p.355</ref> By 1797 his weight had reached 17&nbsp;stone 7&nbsp;pounds (111&nbsp;kg or 245&nbsp;lb),<ref>De-la-Noy, p.43</ref> and by 1824 his corset was made for a waist of 50&nbsp;inches (127&nbsp;cm).<ref>Parissien, p.171</ref> He suffered from [[gout]], [[arteriosclerosis]], [[dropsy]] and possible [[porphyria]]; he would spend whole days in bed and suffered spasms of breathlessness that would leave him half-asphyxiated.<ref name="dnb" /> Some accounts claim that he showed signs of mental instability towards the end of his life, although less extreme than his father; for example, he sometimes claimed that he had been at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], which may have been a sign of [[dementia]] or just a joke to annoy the [[Duke of Wellington]]. He died at about half-past three in the morning of 26 June 1830 at Windsor Castle; he called out "Good God, what is this?" clasped his page's hand and said "my boy, this is death."<ref>De-la-Noy, p.103</ref> He was buried in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]] on 15 July.<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p.336</ref>

His only legitimate child, [[Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales]], had died from [[Obstetrical haemorrhage|post-partum complications]] in 1817, after delivering a still-born son. The second son of [[George III]], [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], had died in 1827. He was therefore succeeded by another brother, the third son of George III, [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Prince William, Duke of Clarence]], who reigned as William IV.<ref>{{cite book | last =Innes | first =Arthur Donald | title = A History of England and the British Empire, Vol. 4 | publisher=The MacMillan Company| year =1915 | pages = 105 }}</ref>

[[Image:a-voluptuary.jpg|thumb|left|150px|"A Voluptuary Under The Horrors of Digestion," a caricature (1792) by [[James Gillray]] from George's time as Prince of Wales.]]
His last years were marked by increasing physical and mental decay and withdrawal from public affairs. Privately a senior aide to the king confided to his diary:<ref>Kenneth Baker, "George IV: a Sketch." ''History Today'' 2005 55(10): 30<U+2013>36.</ref> "A more contemptible, cowardly, selfish, unfeeling dog does not exist....There have been good and wise kings but not many of them...and this I believe to be one of the worst."

On George's death ''[[The Times]]'' captured elite opinion succinctly: "There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow?&nbsp;... If he ever had a friend <U+2013> a devoted friend in any rank of life <U+2013> we protest that the name of him or her never reached us."<ref>''The Times (London)'' 15 July 1830 quoted in Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p. 342</ref>

[[File:1819 Prince Regent G Cruikshank caricature.png|thumb|right|150px|An unflattering 1819 caricature by [[George Cruikshank]], illustrating "The Political House that Jack Built" by [[William Hone]].]]
During the political crisis caused by Catholic emancipation, the Duke of Wellington said that George was "the worst man he ever fell in with his whole life, the most selfish, the most false, the most ill-natured, the most entirely without one redeeming quality",<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p.310</ref> but his eulogy delivered in the [[House of Lords]] called George "the most accomplished man of his age" and praised his knowledge and talent.<ref name="hibbert">Hibbert, ''George IV: Regent and King 1811<U+2013>1830'', p.344</ref> Wellington's true feelings probably lie somewhere between these two extremes; as he said later, George was "a magnificent patron of the arts&nbsp;... the most extraordinary compound of talent, wit, buffoonery, obstinacy, and good feeling<U+2014>in short a medley of the most opposite qualities, with a great preponderence of good<U+2014>that I ever saw in any character in my life."<ref name="hibbert" />

George IV was described as the "First Gentleman of England" on account of his style and manners.<ref>''The Diary of Prince P<U+00FC>ckler-Muskau'' (May 1828). Quoted in Parissien, p.420</ref> Certainly, he possessed many good qualities; he was bright, clever, and knowledgeable. However, his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent. As ''The Times'' once wrote, he would always prefer "a girl and a bottle to politics and a sermon."<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Clarke |first=John |title=George IV |journal=The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England |publisher=Knopf |year=1975 |pages=225 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref>

There are many statues of George IV, a large number of which were erected during his reign. In the United Kingdom, they include a [[bronze]] statue of him on horseback by [[Francis Chantrey|Sir Francis Chantrey]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] and another outside the Royal Pavilion in [[Brighton]].

In [[Edinburgh]], "George IV Bridge" is a main street linking the Old Town High Street to the north over the ravine of the Cowgate, designed by the architect [[Thomas Hamilton (architect)|Thomas Hamilton]] in 1829 and completed in 1835. [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], now a major transport hub sitting on the border of [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] in north London, takes its name from a short-lived monument erected to George IV in the early 1830s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/leisure/local-history/camdens-history.en|publisher=Camden Council|title=Camden's history|accessdate=5 March 2007}}</ref>

The Regency period saw a shift in fashion that was largely determined by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair.<ref>Parissien, p. 112</ref> He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee breeches because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin.<ref>Parissien, p.114</ref> His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish [[tartan]] dress as it is known today.<ref>Parissien, pp. 324<U+2013>26</ref>

===Titles and styles===
*'''12 August 1762 <U+2013> 19 August 1762''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Cornwall
*'''19 August 1762 <U+2013> 29 January 1820''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales
*'''5 February 1811<ref name="c4" /> <U+2013> 29 January 1820''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince Regent

*'''29 January 1820 <U+2013> 26 June 1830''': ''His Majesty'' The King

Under the Act of Parliament that instituted the Regency, the Prince's formal title as Regent was "Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland",<ref>Hibbert, ''George IV: Prince of Wales 1762<U+2013>1811'', p.280</ref> and thus, during the Regency period his formal style was "''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales, Regent of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". The simplified style "''His Royal Highness'' The Prince Regent" was more common even in official documents. George IV's official style as King of the United Kingdom was "George the Fourth, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith". While heir apparent and before his accession as king, he was also the Crown Prince of Hanover.
