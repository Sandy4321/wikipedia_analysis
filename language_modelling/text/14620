==Life==
Ronnie Lee Gardner was born in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] and was the youngest of Dan and Ruth Gardner's seven children. Dan was a heavy drinker who left the household to start another family while Ronnie was a toddler; Dan and Ruth divorced when Ronnie was 18&nbsp;months old. Six months later, Ronnie was found malnourished and wandering the streets alone in a diaper. Child welfare workers filed a "failure to care" petition and took him into custody, but later returned him to his mother. Ronnie Lee Gardner's relationship with his father was tumultuous; Dan did not believe he was Gardner's biological father and frequently told his son of his belief. According to Gardner, he was raised by an older sister, and was sexually abused by his siblings.<ref name="SLT-20100614"/><ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment">{{cite news|last=Donaldson|first=Amy|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700039868/Crime-and-punishment-for-Ronnie-Lee-Gardner.html|title=Crime and punishment for Ronnie Lee Gardner|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1<U+2013>6|accessdate=2010-10-02|date=2010-06-12}}</ref> Sometimes he and his sister Bonnie would run away and seek refuge in a "[[hobo]] camp." By the age of 10, Gardner was addicted to drugs and permitted access to alcohol. He and his brother Randy were arrested for stealing cowboy boots and taken into [[juvenile detention]]. Gardner recalled with distress that his father Dan came to take his brother Randy home and left him behind.<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" />

===Early institutionalization===
Gardner's mother married Bill Lucas, who had been incarcerated in Wyoming in 1968.<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> The Gardner-Lucas family eventually had nine children. Gardner admired Lucas, who used his stepsons as lookouts while burglarizing homes. By his early teens, Gardner had been in held in detention at a series of institutions, including an [[involuntary commitment]] at [[Utah State Hospital]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].<ref name="SLT-20100614"/> Gardner was small as a boy, and described that he had to fight to defend himself and earn respect. In Gardner's own words, "I was a nasty little bugger."<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" />

While held at [[Utah State Industrial School]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Gardner was visited by Jack Statt, a man who was living with his brother Randy.<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> According to Gardner, Statt met Randy at a bus stop and paid him $25 for oral sex.<ref name="SLT-20100614"/> When released from the school in 1975, Gardner stayed with Statt. Although social workers noted that the men in the household were [[transvestism|dressed like women]], Statt officially became a [[foster care|foster parent]] to Gardner and his brother. Gardner stated that Statt performed sex acts on them and explained, "I thought life like that was normal."<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> Gardner told psychologists that he worked as a [[prostitute]] while living with Statt, who was profiled by the psychologists as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]]. Gardner said his time in foster care was the most stable period of his life, stating, "Jack was a good man, and he tried to help us out."<ref name="SLT-20100614" />

While Gardner intermittently continued to go to the industrial school,<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> he met Debra Bischoff at a Salt Lake City apartment complex where his mother lived. Bischoff described him as: "Very caring. He never put me in the rough situations he was in throughout his life. He sheltered me from that stuff." Gardner had a daughter<!--, Brandie,--> in May 1977 and a son<!--, Daniel,--> in February 1980 with Bischoff, but was convicted of [[robbery]] and sent to [[Utah State Prison]] in the same month his son was born.<ref name="SLT-20100614" /><ref name="SLT-20100617-goodbye">{{cite news|last= LaPlante |first=Matthew D.|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49784115-76/gardner-family-members-brandie.html.csp|title=For family, it<U+2019>s a final goodbye|accessdate=2010-10-04|date=2010-06-17}}</ref> Gardner successfully escaped the prison's [[Prison#Security levels|maximum security]] unit  on April 19, 1981, and was shot in the neck while attempting to kill a man that he believed had raped Bischoff.<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> In February 1983, he was identified as a ringleader in a disturbance in which inmates barricaded a cell block where they started fires.<ref name="Gadsden-19850402-courthouse" />

On August 6, 1984, Gardner escaped from custody at the [[University of Utah Hospital]] after he faked an illness by [[vomiting]]. He attacked transportation officer Don Leavitt and forced him to unlock his shackles by telling him: "I guess you know if that doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both."<ref name="Gadsden-19850402-courthouse" /><ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> In the course of the escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face.<ref name="SLT-20100614" /> Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back.<ref name="Deseret-20100612-punishment" /> On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, "Here<U+2019>s the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital. I don<U+2019>t want to hurt no one else. I just want to be free."<ref name="SLT-20100614" />

===Murders===
During the night of October 9, 1984, Gardner attempted to rob the Cheers Tavern in [[Salt Lake City]]. While high on [[cocaine]], he shot bartender Melvyn John Otterstrom in the nose, killing him.<ref name="SLT-20100614" /><ref name="SLT-20100916-destroyed">{{cite news|last=Smart|first=Christopher|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/49704873-76/jason-kathy-melvyn-gardner.html.csp|title=<U+2018>Gardner has destroyed enough lives<U+2019>|pages=1<U+2013>3|accessdate=2010-10-24|date=2010-09-16}}</ref> Otterstrom's cousin Craig Watson stated that the robbery "gained less than $100."

Gardner was taken to the University of Utah Health Services Center where he was listed in [[serious condition]], but survived.

In June 1985, Gardner [[plea|pled]] guilty to the murder of Otterstrom and received a sentence of [[life imprisonment]] without the possibility of parole.<ref name="SLT-20100614" /> At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again.

Though Thomas had survived the stabbing, Gardner was charged with another [[capital punishment|capital crime]] under a 1974 Utah law reserved for prison attacks by first-degree felony inmates.<ref name="Deseret-19950209-constitutionality">{{cite news|last=Parkinson|first=Chip|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/403500/CONSTITUTIONALITY-AT-ISSUE-IN-2ND-DEATH-PENALTY.html|title=Constitutionality at issue in 2nd death penalty|pages=B1<U+2013>B2|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=1995-02-09}}</ref> There was no precedent in the United States for a death penalty that was carried out for such a crime.

In February 1996, Gardner threatened to sue to force the state of Utah to execute him by firing squad. He had told a judge in a 1991 hearing that he was motivated by his children to seek lethal injection, but later changed his mind as they became older. He said that he preferred the firing squad because of his "Mormon heritage." Gardner also felt that lawmakers were trying to eliminate the firing squad, in opposition to popular opinion in Utah, because of concern over the state's image in the upcoming [[2002 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="Deseret-19960209-threatens" />

In 1998, the old Metropolitan Hall of Justice was vacated and replaced by the multimillion-dollar [[Scott M. Matheson]] Courthouse. Gardner's 1985 courthouse shooting was blamed on the open access and light security of the previous building and greatly influenced the tighter security measures adopted by Salt Lake City's new courthouse. Former prosecutor Kent Morgan stated, "Absolutely Gardner changed that."<ref name="Deseret-20100615-security" /> On March 3, 2001, the Metropolitan Hall of Justice was demolished.<ref name="SLCSheriff-20100615-history">{{cite news|author=Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office|url=http://www.slsheriff.org/metrojail/security/HistoryoftheSaltLakeCountyJail.htm|title=History of the Salt Lake County Jail|accessdate=2010-08-19|year=2009}}</ref>

In 2007, U.S. federal judge [[Tena Campbell]] rejected Gardner's appeal that his attorneys were inadequate because they were unable to prove that he did not mean to kill his victim. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]] rejected motions for appeal by his defense on March 8, 2010.<ref name="SLT-20100405">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/49345971-78/gardner-execution-lee-ronnie.html.csp|title=Killer to get info on execution means|last=Manson|first=Pamela|accessdate=2010-09-25|date=2010-04-05}}</ref> Gardner attempted to give up the process at least three times, but his attorneys convinced him to continue appealing each time.<ref name="SLT-20100614" /> State court Judge Robin Reese signed an [[execution warrant]] on April 23 ordering the state to carry out the death sentence.<ref name="CBS-20100423-condemned">{{cite news|publisher=[[CBS News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|last=Martinez|first=Edecio|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20003249-504083.html|title=Ronnie Lee Gardner, Condemned Utah Killer, Could Face Firing Squad|accessdate=2010-06-21|date=2010-04-23}}</ref> 

At Gardner's [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] hearing on June 10, 2010, lawyers and medical experts in his defense argued whether [[meningitis]] contracted at the age of 4 had damaged his brain.

Assistant state attorney general Tom Brunker argued against clemency, stating: "Mr. Gardner was sentenced to death and earned that death penalty because of his unflagging history of violent crime."<ref name="Deseret-20100610-example" /> The family of the late George "Nick" Kirk recounted how his being shot by Gardner affected their lives and ultimately shortened Kirk's life.

[[Opposition to capital punishment in the United States|Opponents of capital punishment]] gathered at the [[Utah State Capitol]] to hold a rally during the final appeals. The protest was attended by Gardner's family, and was organized by Utahns for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.

<blockquote>
In the mid-19th century, when rhetorical, emotional oratory was common, some church members and leaders used strong language that included notions of people making restitution for their sins by giving up their own lives.

However, so-called "blood atonement," by which individuals would be required to shed their own blood to pay for their sins, is not a doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe in and teach the infinite and all-encompassing atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes forgiveness of sin and salvation possible for all people.<ref name="Deseret-20100617-atonement" />
</blockquote>

Other denominations voiced their opposition to the use of capital punishment. Reverend David Henry of the First Baptist Church of Salt Lake City said, "Violence breeds violence... It doesn<U+2019>t work. It's ineffective, and it's brutalizing all of us."<ref name="SLT-20100618-protesters" /> Cardinal [[Keith Michael Patrick O'Brien|Keith O'Brien]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] later used Gardner's case to describe the "culture of [[revenge|vengeance]]" in the United States.<ref name="ch-201000809" />

The firing squad was made up of five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers. The officers stood about 25 feet from the target.
