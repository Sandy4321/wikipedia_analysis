'''Arthur Karl Greiser''' (22 January 1897 &ndash; 21 July 1946) was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany|German]] [[politician]], [[SS]]-[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]] and Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) of the German-occupied territory of [[Wartheland]]. He was one of the persons primarily responsible for organizing the [[Holocaust]] in Poland and numerous other [[crimes against humanity]]. Arrested by the Americans in 1945, he was tried, convicted and executed by [[hanging]] in Poland in 1946.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[<U+015A>roda Wielkopolska|Schroda]] (<U+015A>roda Wielkopolska), [[Province of Posen]], [[Imperial Germany]], Greiser was the son of a minor local [[bailiff]] (''Gerichtsvollzieher''). In 1903, he was enrolled at the K<U+00F6>niglich-Humanistische Gymnasium (Royal Humanities College) in [[Hohensalza]] and is believed to have learnt to speak [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently. In August, 1914, he joined the Kaiserliche Marine as a Kriegsfreiwilliger. He served at the naval forts in Korugen, Falkenstein, and in the fortress tower of Laboe from August, 1914 to July, 1915. He was then assigned as an Artilleriebeobachter or artillery observer in Flanders as well as participating in minesweeping operations in Friedrichsort. In April, 1917, he volunteered for service in the Naval Fliegertruppe where he initially served as an observer with SEE I and II and then with Kustenfliegerstaffel I and II. From August, 1917 to August, 1918, he was assigned as a naval aviator to Marine Schutzstaffel I. During this time, he was transferred to Seeflugstation Flandern II (Ostende) and he later flew with the Seefrontstaffel and MFJ IV. From December, 1917 to January, 1918, he was attached to the KE-Schule Langfuhr (near Danzig). While deployed to combat duty, he flew missions over the North Sea between the southern English and Belgian coasts. He was later shot down and wounded by gunfire. On 30 September 1919, he was classified as 50% war-disabled and discharged from naval service. He earned the [[Iron Cross]] (First and Second Class), the Cross of Honour 1914<U+2013>1918 Combatants medal, and a [[Wound Badge]] Black Class in 1914. From 1919 to May 1921, he served in the [[Freikorps]] ''[[Grenzschutz Ost]]'' and fought in the [[Baltic states]].

==Beginning career in the Nazi Party==
Greiser was fanatically anti-Christian,<ref name="Evans2009">{{cite book|author=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich at War: 1939-1945|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WjoiVWGQ9HYC&pg=PT482|accessdate=13 January 2013|date=19 March 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-101-02230-6|pages=482<U+2013>}}</ref> and an early member of the [[Nazi Party]] (number 166,635). After many years with the nationalist [[Deutschsoziale Partei]] (DtSP) founded by von Kunze, and membership of the [[Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Stahlhelm]] in the mid-1920s, he joined the NSDAP and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] on 1 November 1929. He joined the [[SS]] on 30 June 1931,<ref>http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=87731</ref> and was later awarded the [[Golden Party Badge]].

He was the Senate President (Senatspr<U+00E4>sident) of the [[Free City of Danzig]] ([[Gda<U+0144>sk]], [[Poland]]) in 1935<U+2013>1939, and the administrator (Reichsstatthalter und Gauleiter) of [[Reichsgau Wartheland]] (1939<U+2013>1945). As Senate President of Danzig, he was described as a <U+201C>hothead<U+201D> and was a serious rival to his nominal superior [[Albert Forster]], Gauleiter of the city since 1930. Greiser was part of the SS empire whilst Forster was closely aligned to the Nazi Party Mandarins [[Rudolf Hess]] and later [[Martin Bormann]].

Greiser was directly responsible for escalating tensions between the Free City and the Republic of Poland in 1939. When the [[Poland|Polish]] Foreign Affairs Minister [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]] threatened economic reprisals following the harassment of Polish frontier guards and customs officers, Greiser issued an announcement on 29 July 1939 declaring that the Danzig police no longer recognised their authority or power, and demanded their immediate withdrawal. The notice was so rudely worded that the Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, [[Marian Chodacki]], refused to forward it to Beck and instead sent a court summary.

Immediately following the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]], Greiser was transferred from Danzig and appointed <U+201C>Chef der Zivilverwaltung im Milit<U+00E4>rbezirk Posen<U+201D> or Chief of Civil Administration in the military district of [[Greater Poland]], which was annexed to the German Reich on 8 September 1939. The military administration ended the following month, and he was then appointed [[Gauleiter]] (21 October) and  "[[Reichsstatthalter]] f<U+00FC>r den [[Reichsgau Posen]]" (26 October). On 29 January 1940, the region was renamed [[Reichsgau Wartheland]]. 

The territory was potentially very rich - the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] Imperial province of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] had been the breadbasket of [[Wilhelmine]] Germany before 1914, possessed an excellent rail and road network, and a comparatively healthy and well educated workforce; [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>|Litzmanstadt]] had developed a fairly sophisticated industrial base during the 19th century. Although every Gauleiter was expected to fully Germanize their assigned area by any method,<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis'', p. 251</ref> Greiser emphasized brutality to achieve this goal. He was an ardent [[racism|racist]] who enthusiastically pursued an '[[ethnic cleansing]]' program to rid the Warthegau of [[Poles]] and to resettle the 'cleansed' areas with ethnic Germans.<ref>Rees, Laurence ''The Nazis: A Warning From History'', New York: New Press, 1997 pp. 143-145</ref> This was along the lines of the racial theories espoused by [[Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]]. Mass expulsions of Poles from the Warthegau to the [[General Government]] and summary executions were the norm. A Polish servant in Greiser's house described him as "...a powerfully built figure. He was a tall man, you could see his arrogance, his conceit. He was so vain, so full of himself-as if there was nothing above him, a god, almost. Everybody tried to get out of his way, people had to bow to him, salute him. And the Poles, he treated them with great contempt. For him the Poles were slaves, good for nothing, but work".<ref>Rees, Laurence ''The Nazis: A Warning From History'', New York: New Press, 1997 p. 142</ref> Greiser himself stated his beliefs: "If, in past times, other peoples enjoyed their century-long history by living well, and doing so by getting foreign peoples to work for them without compensating them accordingly and without meting out justice to them, then we too, as Germans want to learn from this history. No longer must we stand in the wings; on the contrary, we must altogether become a master race!".<ref>Rees, Laurence ''The Nazis: A Warning From History'', New York: New Press, 1997 p. 145</ref>

In addition to mass deportation, Greiser's district was also at the forefront of "internal" racial cleansing according to Nazi ideals. His subordinate [[Wilhelm Koppe]] provided the '[[Herbert Lange|Special Detachment (Sonderkommando) Lange]]' to the nearby [[Gau (administrative division)|Gau]] of [[East Prussia]] during May and June 1940. This SS squad gassed 1558 patients from mental asylums at the [[Soldau concentration camp]] and then returned to his region to continue this process.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis'', p. 261</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J09397, Lodz, Millionster Umsiedler im Wartheland.jpg||220px|thumb|Arthur Greiser welcoming the one-millionth [[Volksdeutche]]r resettled from East Europe to occupied Poland as part of the "[[Heim ins Reich]]" campaign  - March 1944]]
Perhaps the only evidence of humanitarian acts in Greiser's career was his involvement in the resettlement of German [[refugees]] from lands annexed to the [[Soviet Union]] over 1939 to 1940. Between October and December 1939 nearly 60,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] arrived in [[Germany]] from the [[Baltic states]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Evidently [[Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt]] (later employed as translator for General [[Andrey Vlasov]]) was in this group as he "resettled" in [[Pozna<U+0144>|Posen]]. Neighbouring [[Gauleiter]] and rival [[Albert Forster]] refused them entry and they were largely settled in properties seized from Poles in [[Pozna<U+0144>]] and across the [[Wartheland]]. However even Greiser was wary, noting that many were elderly and urbanized aristocrats with a strong class consciousness, not the virile peasant warrior types idolized by the SS. Closer to his heart were the over 100,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] who were evacuated from [[Volhynia]] and eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. These were mostly farmers and rural people, and, learning from the Baltic experience, <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> in eastern Wartheland was designated the main [[Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]] (VoMi) reception centre. In May 1940 a further 30,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] were relocated from the [[Nazi]] General Government of Poland to Greiser<U+2019>s domain. After 1941 a further 300,000 [[Volksdeutsche]] were evacuated from [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to Wartheland during the German invasion and occupation of the Soviet Union. Greiser<U+2019>s Pozna<U+0144> was considered the Germanised city par excellence and on 3 August 1943 he hosted a national gathering of Gauleiter and senior Nazis, including [[Martin Bormann]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Heinrich Himmler.

SS-[[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]] Greiser was fully aware of the [[Holocaust]] and actively participated in it. Early in 1940, Greiser is on record challenging [[Hermann G<U+00F6>ring]] over efforts to delay the expulsion of <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> [[Jews]] to Poland. On 18 September 1941, Reichsf<U+00FC>hrer-SS Heinrich Himmler informed Greiser that he intended to transfer 60,000 [[Czechs|Czech]] and German Jews to the <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> [[ghetto]], until spring 1942 when they would be "resettled". The first transport arrived a few weeks later, and Greiser sought and received permission from Himmler to kill 100,000 Jews in his area.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis'', p. 484</ref> He then instructed [[HSSPF]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] to manage the overcrowding. Koppe and SS-[[Sturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Herbert Lange]] proceeded to manage the problem by experimenting at a country estate at [[Che<U+0142>mno nad Nerem]] with gas vans, establishing the first extermination unit which ultimately carried out the mass murder of approximately 150,000 Jews between late 1941 and April 1942. Furthermore on 6 October 1943 Greiser hosted a national assembly of senior SS officers in [[Pozna<U+0144>|Posen]] at which Himmler candidly spoke of the mass executions of civilians (the infamous [[Posen Speech]]).

On 20 January 1945, Greiser ordered a general evacuation of Posen (having received a telegram from Bormann relaying Hitler's order to leave the city). Greiser left the city the same evening and reported to Himmler's personal train in Frankfurt am Oder. There Greiser found that he had been tricked by Bormann. Hitler had announced that Posen must be held at all costs, and Greiser was now viewed as a deserter and coward, particularly by Goebbels who wrote the following in his diary on 2 March 1945, in which he labeled Greiser "a real disgrace to the ([[Nazism|Nazi]]) Party.", but his recommendations for punishment after the capture of Pozna<U+0144> were ignored.<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936-1945: Nemesis'', p. 1019</ref>

He surrendered to the [[United States|Americans]] in [[Austria]] with SS-Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer [[Heinz Reinefarth]] in 1945.

==Trial and execution==
After the war, the Polish government (the [[Supreme National Tribunal]]) tried him for [[war crime]]s. His defense that he was only following orders did not hold up as it was shown that other Gauleiters had not followed a similar policy. For example, [[Albert Forster]], [[Gauleiter]] of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] (the other German-annexed section of occupied Poland), simply declared all Poles in his area who were reasonably proficient in [[German language|German]] to be Germans (although he was guilty of the elimination of the Jewish population under his jurisdiction either by murder or deportation). Greiser's advocates, [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Hejmowski]] and [[Jan Kr<U+0119>glewski]], tried to convince the Tribunal that Greiser, as a head of formally independent state, the [[Free City of Danzig]], could not be judged by another country, an argument rejected by the court. Greiser was convicted for:
*[[Genocide]] and the [[murder]]s of civilians and [[POW]]
*Torture, persecution, and injuring civilians and [[POW]]s
*Organized and systematic destruction of Polish culture, plunder of Polish cultural heritage, [[Germanisation]] of the country and the Polish people, illegal appropriation of public property.
*Organized and systematic looting of Polish property
*Insulting and deriding the Polish nation by propagating its cultural inferiority and low social worth
*Forcible expelling of whole districts, streets, families and singular persons to [[General Government]] or [[Arbeitslager|forced labor camps]] in German Reich
*Persecution and murder of Polish [[Jews]] by killing them in place of residence, grouping in closed [[ghetto]]s from where they were sent to [[Chelmno extermination camp]] for extermination in [[gas chamber]]s, deriding the Jewish people in actions and words, causing physical suffering, injury and humiliation of human dignity
*[[Kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany|Taking Polish children against the will of their parents or guardians]], forcibly putting them in German families or public orphanages within the Reich while breaking all contacts with their family and nation by giving them German names

The Tribunal decided that Greiser was guilty of all charges, and sentenced him to death by hanging, [[civil death]], and confiscation of all his property. In the early morning of 21 July 1946 he was transported from prison to the slope of [[Fort Winiary]] where he was [[hanging|hanged]] before a large crowd.<ref>Catherine Epstein: ''Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland'', p. 334-335</ref> It was the last public execution in Poland.<ref>http://wiadomosci.polska.pl/kalendarz/kalendarium/article.htm?id=223986</ref>
