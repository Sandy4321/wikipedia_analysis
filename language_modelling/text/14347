The '''antediluvian''' (or '''pre-diluvian''') '''period'''<U+2014>meaning "before the deluge"<U+2014>is the period referred to in the [[Bible]] between the [[Fall of man]] and the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]] (flood) in the [[biblical cosmology]]. The narrative takes up chapters 1-6 (excluding the flood narrative) of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. The term found its way into early [[geology]] and lingered in science until the late [[Victorian era]]. Colloquially, the term is used to refer to any ancient and murky period.

==Timing the antediluvian period==

===The biblical flood===

In religious texts such as the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] and the [[Torah|Hebrew Torah]], the antediluvian period begins with the creation according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and ends with the destruction of all life on the earth except those saved with [[Noah]] in the [[Noah's Ark|ark]]. According to Bishop [[James Ussher|Ussher]]'s 17th-century [[Ussher chronology|chronology]], the antediluvian period lasted for 1656 years, from creation at 4004 BC to the flood at 2348 BC.<ref>Abbott, W. M. (1990). "James Ussher and "Ussherian" episcopacy, 1640<U+2013>1656: the primate and his Reduction manuscript." Albion xxii: 237-59.</ref> 
The elements of the narrative include some of the best-known stories in the Bible <U+2014> the creation, [[Adam and Eve]], and [[Cain and Abel]], followed by the genealogies tracing the descendants of Cain and [[Seth]], the third mentioned son of Adam and Eve. (These genealogies provide the framework for the biblical chronology, in the form ''A lived X years and begat B'').<ref>Ussher, J, 1650.  ''Annals of the World: James Ussher's Classic Survey of World History'' ISBN 0-89051-360-0 (Modern English republication, ed. Larry and Marion Pierce, Green Forest, AR: Master Books, 2003)</ref>

The [[Bible]] speaks of this era as being a time of great [[total depravity|wickedness]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Genesis|6:4<U+2013>5|KJV}}</ref> There were [[Gibborim (biblical)|Gibborim]] (giants) in the earth in those days as well as [[Nephilim]]; some [[Bible translation|translations]] identify the two as one and the same.  The Gibborim were unusually powerful; Genesis calls them "mighty men which ''were'' of old, men of renown".<ref>Multi-version compare Genesis [http://studybible.info/compare/Genesis%206:4 6:4] &amp; [http://studybible.info/compare/Genesis%206:5 6:5]</ref> The antediluvian period ended when God sent the Flood to wipe out all life except Noah, his family, and the animals they took with them. Nevertheless, the Nephilim (literally meaning 'fallen ones', from the Hebrew root n-f-l 'to fall') reappear much later in the biblical narrative, in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{Bibleref2-nb|Numbers|13:31<U+2013>33|9}} (where the spies sent forth by [[Moses]] report that there were Nephilim or "giants" in the [[promised land]]).

Early scientific attempts at reconstructing the [[history of the Earth]] were founded on the biblical narrative and thus used the term ''Antediluvian'' to refer to a period understood to be essentially similar to the biblical one.<ref name="Rudwick">[[Martin J. S. Rudwick|Rudwick, M.J.S]] (1992): Scenes from Deep Time: Early Pictorial Representations of the Prehistoric World, [[University of Chicago Press]], 280 pages. [http://books.google.com/books?id=eM0xUqbjzs0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false Except] from Google Books</ref> Early scientific interpretation of the biblical narrative divided the Antediluvian into sub-periods based on the [[Genesis_creation_narrative#The_six_days_of_Creation:_Genesis_1:3-2:3|six days of creation]]:

* Pre-Adamitic (the first 5 days, Gen 1:1 to Gen 2:3)
** Primary (the formation of the physical universe and the earth)
** Secondary (creation of plants and animals)
* Adamitic (or Tertiary, from the creation of man to the [[Great Flood]]; Gen 2:5 to Gen 7.8), corresponding to [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s First Age of his [[Six Ages of the World]]<ref>{{emc1|Graeme Dunphy|Six Ages of the World|1367-1370}}</ref>

Prior to the 19th century, rock was classified into three main types: primary or primitive ([[Igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]), secondary ([[sedimentary rock]]) and tertiary ([[sediment]]s). The primary rocks (like [[granite]] and [[gneiss]]) are void of fossils and were thought to be associated with the very creation of the world in the primary Pre-Adamitic period. The secondary rocks, often containing copious fossils, though human remains had not been found, were thought to have been laid down in the secondary Pre-Adamitic period. The tertiary rocks (sediments) were thought to have been put down after Creation and possibly in connection to a flood event, and were thus associated with the Adamitic period.<ref>Gohau, G. (1991) ''A History of Geology'' (Revised edition). [[Rutgers University Press]]. 259 pages ISBN 0-8135-1666-8</ref> The post-flood period was termed the [[Quaternary]], a name still in use in geology.

As mapping of the geological [[stratum|strata]] progressed in the early decades of the 19th century, the estimated lengths of the various sub-periods were greatly increased. The fossil rich Secondary Pre-Adamitic period was divided up into the [[Carboniferous|Coal period]], the [[Early Jurassic|Lias]] and the [[Cretaceous|Chalk period]], later expanded into the now-familiar [[geologic time scale]] of the [[Phanerozoic]].<ref name="Rudwick"/> The term ''antediluvian'' was used in [[natural science]] well into the 19th century and lingered in popular imagination despite increasingly detailed [[stratigraphy]] mapping the [[Geological history of Earth|Earth's past]], and was often used for the [[Pleistocene]] period, where [[Homo|humans]] existed alongside now extinct [[megafauna]].<ref name="Rudwick"/>

==The antediluvian world==

===Creationist interpretation===

Writers such as [[William Whiston]] (''[[A New Theory of the Earth]]'' 1696) and [[Henry M. Morris|Henry Morris]] (''[[The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications|The Genesis Flood]]'' 1961) describe the antediluvian period as follows:<ref>{{cite book | first = William | last = Whiston | year = 1696 | title = A New Theory of the Earth, From its Original, to the Consummation of All Things, Where the Creation of the World in Six Days, the Universal Deluge, And the General Conflagration, As laid down in the Holy Scriptures, Are Shewn to be perfectly agreeable to Reason and Philosophy | publisher = Benjamin Tooke | location = London}}</ref><ref>[[Henry M. Morris|Morris, H.M]] & [[John C. Whitcomb|Whitcomb, J.C.]] (1961): [[The Genesis Flood]]: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications, Presbyterian & Reformed Publishing, Philadelphia, (ISBN 0-8010-6004-4)</ref>

* People lived much longer than those alive today, typically between 700<U+2013>950 years, as reported in the [[genealogies of Genesis]];
* The Earth contained many more people than the Earth contained in 1696.  Whiston calculated that as many as 500 million humans may have been born in the antediluvian period, based on assumptions about lifespans and [[Total Fertility Rate|fertility rates]];
* There were no clouds or rain.  Instead, the Earth was watered by mists which rose from the Earth. (Another interpretation is that the Earth was covered completely by a global cloud layer, which was the upper waters mentioned in the Creation. This is commonly called the [[Vapor canopy|Canopy]] view.)

===In 19th-century science===
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the understanding of the nature of early Earth went through a [[Scientific revolution|transformation]] from a biblical or [[Deism|deist]] interpretation to a scientific one. Even back in the early 18th century, [[Plutonism|Plutonists]] had argued for an ancient Earth, but the full impact of the [[Deep time|depth of time]] involved in the Pre-Adamitic period was not commonly accepted until [[uniformitarianism]] as presented in [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'' of 1830.<ref>[http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/uniformitarianism Uniformitarianism: World of Earth Science]</ref> While vast aeons of time were involved, the narrative of the pre-Adamitic world was still influenced by the biblical story of creation in this transition. A striking example is a description from "Memoires of Ichtyosauri and Plesiosauri", 1839:

{{quote|An "ungarnished and desolated world which echoed the flapping of [pterodactyl] leathern wings" was lit by "the angry light of supernatural fire", shining on a "sunless and moonless" world, ''before'' the creation of these heavenly "lights".<ref>Hawkins, T. (1834): Memoires of Ichtyosauri and Plesiosauri: Extinct Monsters of the Ancient Earth. Cited in Rudwick, 1992</ref>}}

A modern view of the ancient world, along with abandoning the term ''Antediluvian'', came about with the works of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]] in the 1860s.

===The antediluvian monsters===
[[File:MosasaurDiscovery.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|An "antediluvian monster", a ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' discovered in a [[Maastricht]] limestone quarry, 1770 (contemporary engraving)]]
From antiquity, [[fossil]]s of large animals were often quoted as having lived together with the [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] from the [[Book of Genesis]]: e.g. the [[Tannin (demon)|Tannin]] or "great [[sea monster]]s" of Gen. 1,21. They are often described in later books of the [[Bible]], especially by God Himself in the [[Book of Job]]: e.g. [[Re'em]] in verse 39,9, [[Behemoth]] in chapter 40 and [[Leviathan]] in chapter 41.<ref>[http://www.genesispark.com/genpark/bible/bible.htm Genesis Park: Dinosaurs in the Bible]</ref><ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0.htm Mechon-Mamre: A Hebrew - English Bible According to the Masoretic Text and the JPS 1917 Edition]</ref> With the advent of [[Geologic map|geological mapping]] in the early 19th century, it became increasingly obvious that much of the [[fossil]]s associated with the "secondary" (sedimentary) rock, notably large animals like [[Ichthyosaur]]s, [[Mosasaur]]s, [[Pliosaur]]s and the various giant [[mammal]]s found when excavating the [[Catacombs of Paris]], were neither those of giant humans nor of any [[Extant taxon|extant]] animals. The geologists of the day increasingly came to use the term ''Antediluvian'' only for the younger strata containing fossils of animals resembling those alive today.<ref>Rudwick, M.J.S (1989): Encounters with Adam, or at least the hyaenas: Nineteenth-century Visual Representation of Deep Past. In ''History, humanity and evolution: Essay for John C. Greene'' (ed. Moore, J.R), [[Cambridge University Press]], pp 231-251</ref>

==Other uses==
*The term is also used in the field of Assyriology for kings, according to the Sumerian king list, supposed to have reigned before the great flood.
*The adjective ''antediluvian'' is sometimes used [[figurative language|figuratively]] to refer to anything that is of great age or outmoded. [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was particularly fond of the term, using it frequently in his horror stories.

*In [[Charles Stross]]'s ''[[Saturn's Children (Stross novel)|Saturn's Children]]'' the religious order who believe in evolution refer to the antediluvian period as the time in which man lived alongside [[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurs]].

* ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' is an 1882 book by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] that attempted to establish that all known ancient civilizations were descended from [[Atlantis]]. Many theories mentioned in the book are the source of modern-day concepts  about Atlantis.

*In the tabletop [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' the ''[[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvians]]'' are the early vampires that lived in the pre-flood world and the supposed progenitors of the original clans.
