Vivek believes that this is the role of his dreams. Referring to the speculation in the press, Vivek said that "the character that he plays is not very well known". Vivek adds that "He<U+2019>s someone who has been Mani Sir<U+2019>s friend for years. He isn<U+2019>t in the limelight at all. I<U+2019>ve met him once long ago. Now I plan to spend time with him in England before starting work."

Nearly two decades ago [[Mani Ratnam]] had a rift with his regular composer [[Ilaiyaraaja]] after which [[A.R.Rahman]] composed for all of his films. Now he's joining hands with Ilaiyaraaja's youngest son [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]] for his production venture ''Bloody Paki'', as insisted by his director, Shiva. This would be Yuvan's first proper, Bollywood project as a music director, though he composed and sung "Haq Se" in [[Striker (film)|Striker]] along with his buddy [[Siddharth Narayan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/57430.html|title=Mani signs Yuvan for Paki|date=Jun 01 2010|work=IndiaGlitz}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://600024.com/mani-ratnam-opts-for-yuvan-shankar-raja-for-his-next-film/|title=Yuvan confirms Paki|date=Jun 01 2010|work=600024}}</ref> On January 29, 2011, Yuvan started composing initial tunes for this project and said that the tunes came out very well.
