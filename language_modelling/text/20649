The '''Dillingham Transportation Building''' was built in 1929 for [[Walter F. Dillingham]] of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], who founded the Hawaiian Dredging Company (later [[Dillingham Construction]]) and ran the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] founded by his father, [[Benjamin Franklin Dillingham]]. The building was designed in an Italian [[Renaissance Revival]] by [[architect]] [[Lincoln Rogers]] of Los Angeles, who also designed the [[Hawaii State Art Museum]] (1928). It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979 and restored by Architects Hawai{{okina}}i Ltd. in 1980.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Rob|last2=Mehta|first2=Julie|last3=Haines|first3=Frank S.|title=Architecture in Hawai<U+2018>i: A Chronological Survey, rev. ed.|year=2008|publisher=Mutual Publishing|location=Honolulu|isbn=978-1-56647-873-1|page=59}}</ref>
