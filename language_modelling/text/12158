''This article is about the British underground transport system. For the comedic song, see [[London Underground (song)]].''

The '''London Underground''' is an all-[[electricity|electric]] [[metro]] railway system in [[England]] that covers much of the conurbation of [[Greater London]] and some neighbouring areas. It is the world's oldest underground system, and is the largest in terms of route length. Service began on [[10 January]] [[1863]] on the [[Metropolitan Railway]]; most of that initial route is now part of the [[Hammersmith & City Line]]. Despite its name, about 55% of the network is above ground. Popular local names include '''the Underground''' and, more colloquially, '''the Tube''', in reference to the cylindrical shape of the system's deep-bore tunnels.

The Underground currently serves 274 [[metro station|stations]] and runs over [[1 E5 m|408 km]] (253&nbsp;[[mile]]s) of lines[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/company/facts.asp]. There are also a number of former stations and tunnels that are [[Closed London Underground stations|now closed]]. In 2004&ndash;2005, total passenger journeys reached a record level of 976 million, an average of 2.67 million per day.

Since 2003, the Underground has been part of [[Transport for London]] (TfL), which also administers Greater London's buses, including the famous red [[double-decker bus|double-deckers]], and carries out numerous other transport-related functions in the region; as London Underground Limited it was previously a subsidiary of [[London Regional Transport]], a statutory corporation.

==History==
{{main|History of the London Underground}}
[[Image:Why London Underground is nicknamed The Tube.jpg|thumb|The nickname "the Tube" comes from the circular tube-like tunnels through which the small-profile trains travel. This photograph shows a southbound [[Northern Line]] train leaving a tunnel just north of [[Hendon Central]] station.]]

===Beginnings===
The [[Metropolitan Railway]], the first section of the London Underground, initially ran between Paddington (Bishop's Bridge), now just [[Paddington]], and Farringdon Street, a temporary station just north-west of the present [[Farringdon]] station, and was the world's first urban underground passenger-carrying railway. Following delays for financial and other reasons after the railway was authorised in 1854, public traffic began on [[10 January]] [[1863]]. 40,000 passengers were carried that day, with trains running every ten minutes; by 1880 the expanded 'Met' was carrying 40 million passengers a year. Other lines swiftly followed, and by 1884 the Inner Circle (today's [[Circle Line]]) was complete. These early lines used steam-hauled trains, which required effective ventilation to the surface. Advances in electric traction later allowed tunnels to be deeper underground than the original [[cut-and-cover]] method allowed, and deep-level tunnel design improved, including the use of [[tunnelling shield]]s. The [[City & South London Railway]] (now part of the [[Northern Line]]), the first "deep-level" line and electrically operated, opened in 1890.

===Into the 20th century===
In the early 20th century, the presence of six independent operators running different Underground lines caused passengers substantial inconvenience; in many places passengers had to walk some distance above ground to change between lines. The costs associated with running such a system were also heavy, and as a result many companies looked to financiers who could give them the money they needed to expand into the lucrative suburbs as well as electrify the earlier steam operated lines. The most prominent of these was [[Charles Yerkes]], an American tycoon who between 1900 and 1902 acquired the [[Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways#Metropolitan District Railway|Metropolitan District Railway]] and the as yet unbuilt [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] (later to become part of the [[Northern Line]]). Yerkes also acquired the Great Northern & Strand Railway, the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway (jointly to become the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway]], the core of the [[Piccadilly Line]]) and the Baker Street & Waterloo Railway (to become the [[Bakerloo Line]]) to form [[Underground Electric Railways Company|Underground Electric Railways of London Company Ltd]] on [[9 April]] [[1902]]. That company also owned three tramway companies and went on to buy the [[London General Omnibus Company]], creating an organisation colloquially known as the Combine. On [[1 January]] [[1913]] the UERL absorbed two other independent tube lines, the C&SLR and the Central London Railway, the latter having opened an important east-west cross-city line from Bank to Shepherd's Bush on [[30 July]] [[1900]].

===The 1930s and 1940s===
In 1933, a public corporation called the [[London's transport history from 1933|London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB) was created. The Combine and all the municipal and independent bus and tram undertakings were merged into the LPTB, an organisation that approximated in scope to TfL. It set in train<!-- What a pun!--> a scheme for expansion of the network, the 1935<U+2013>1940 New Works plan, which was to extend some lines, and to take over the operation of others from the main-line companies; however, the outbreak of [[World War II]] froze all these schemes. From mid-1940, [[the Blitz]] led to the use of many Underground stations as [[air-raid shelter]]s, first on an ''ad hoc'' basis, which the authorities tried to prevent, but later with proper [[bunk]]s, [[latrine]]s, and [[catering]] facilities.

===Post-war developments===
[[Image:TubeStationWithTrain.jpg|thumb||A [[London Underground 1995 Stock]] train pulls into [[Mornington Crescent tube station|Mornington Crescent]] station on the [[Northern Line]].]]
Following the war, travel congestion continued to rise. The carefully planned [[Victoria Line]] on a diagonal northeast-southwest alignment beneath central London absorbed much of the extra traffic. The Piccadilly Line was extended to [[Heathrow Airport]] in 1977, and the [[Jubilee Line]] was opened in 1979, taking over part of the Bakerloo Line, with new tunnels between Baker Street and Charing Cross. In 1999 the Jubilee was extended to Stratford in London's East End, including the completely refurbished interchange station at Westminster, in several stages.

Since January 2003, the Underground has been operated as a [[Public-Private Partnership]] (PPP), where the infrastructure and rolling stock are maintained by private companies under 30-year contracts, but it remains publicly owned and operated, by TfL. See [[History of the London Underground#Public-Private Partnership|History of the London Underground]] for full details.

===King's Cross fire===
{{main|King's Cross fire}}
On [[18 November]] [[1987]], a devastating fire broke out in King's Cross St Pancras station. Thirty-one people died, killed by the toxic fumes and extreme heat of the blaze. The fire was the result of a discarded match or cigarette igniting rubbish and grease beneath [[wooden escalators]]. As a result of this tragedy, the widely-ignored smoking ban was more rigourously enforced throughout the system.  Almost all the network's wooden escalators have now been replaced by steel ones, and other measures have been put in place to help prevent a repeat incident.

===2005 terrorist bomb attacks===
{{main|7 July 2005 London bombings|21 July 2005 London bombings}}
{{wikinews|Coordinated terrorist attack in London}}
On [[7 July]] [[2005]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings|bombs]] exploded on Underground trains between [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]] and [[Liverpool Street station#London Underground|Liverpool Street]] stations, [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]] and [[King's Cross St Pancras]] stations and [[Edgware Road tube station|Edgware Road]] and [[Paddington station#London Underground|Paddington]] stations. A [[double-decker]] bus at [[Tavistock Square]] was also destroyed. The bombs were detonated by four suicide bombers. The explosions killed 52 people and resulted in over 700 injuries. [[21 July 2005 London bombings|A second series, of minor explosions]], occurred two weeks later on [[21 July]] [[2005]] at [[Shepherd's Bush tube station (Hammersmith and City Line)|Shepherd's Bush]], [[Warren Street]] and [[Oval tube station|Oval]] stations and on a bus in [[Shoreditch]]. Little damage was done and only one person was injured, as all four bombs failed to detonate.

==Network==
[[Image:London_Underground_Zone_1.svg|center|600px|thumb|Zone 1 (central zone) of the Underground network in a more geographically accurate layout than the usual Tube map, using the same style]]

The Underground does not run 24 hours a day because all track maintenance must be done at night after the system closes.  First trains on the network start operating shortly after 5AM with the last trains running until around 12:30AM.  Unlike systems such as the [[New York City Subway]], few parts of the Underground have express tracks that would allow trains to be routed around maintenance sites.  Recently, greater use has been made of weekend closures of parts of the system for scheduled engineering work.

===Rolling stock===
[[Image:Stratford Depot 27.JPG|thumb|1996 tube stock units stabled at Stratford Market Depot.]]
The Underground uses rolling stock built between 1960 and 1996. Stock on sub-surface lines is identified by a letter (such as [[London Underground A62 Stock|A Stock]], used on the [[Metropolitan Line]]), while tube stock is identified by the year in which it was designed (for example, [[London Underground 1996 Stock|1996 Stock]], used on the [[Jubilee Line]]). All lines are worked by a single type of stock except the [[District Line]], which uses both [[London Underground C69 Stock|C]] and [[London Underground D78 Stock|D]] Stock. Two types of stock are currently being developed &mdash; [[London Underground 2009 Stock|2009 Stock]] for the Victoria Line and [[London Underground S Stock|S stock]] for the sub-surface lines, with the Metropolitan Line A Stock being replaced first. Rollout of both is expected to begin about 2009.

For more information on the Underground's rolling stock, see [[London Underground rolling stock]].

===Stations===
The Underground usually serves 274 [[Underground station|stations]], but two stations are closed temporarily: [[Lancaster Gate]], due to reopen in October 2006 and [[Regent's Park tube station|Regents Park]], due to reopen in June 2007.
 
The total above excludes [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch]] which is permanently closed.  However, it is served by a replacement bus service until [[Shoreditch High Street station]] opens as part of the East London Line Extension.

Fourteen stations are outside Greater London, of which five are beyond the [[M25 motorway|M25 London Orbital motorway]].

:''See also:'' [[List of London Underground stations]], [[Closed London Underground stations]].

===Lines===

:''See also:'' [[Railway electrification system#Fourth Rail|Fourth Rail]]

The Underground is one of the few railways electrified by the four-rail system. In addition to the two running rails there are two rails that supply power to the trains, one outside the running rails electrified at +420 [[Voltage|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], the other in the middle at -210 V, producing an overall traction supply voltage of 630 V.

====Sub-surface versus tube lines====
[[Image:London Underground subsurface and tube trains.jpg|thumb|Underground trains come in two sizes, larger sub-surface trains and smaller tube trains. A Metropolitan Line A Stock train (left) passes a Piccadilly Line 1973 Stock train (right) in the siding at Rayners Lane]]

Lines on the Underground can be classified into two types: sub-surface and deep level. The ''sub-surface'' lines were dug by the [[cut-and-cover]] method, with the tracks running about 5&nbsp;[[metre|m]] below the surface. Trains on the sub-surface lines slightly exceed the standard British [[loading gauge]]. The ''deep-level'' or "tube" lines, bored using a [[tunnelling shield]], run about 20&nbsp;m below the surface (although this varies considerably), with each track in a separate tunnel lined with cast-iron rings. These tunnels can have a diameter as small as 3.56&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft 8.25&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) and the loading gauge is thus considerably smaller than on the sub-surface lines. Lines of both types usually emerge onto the surface outside the central area, except the [[Victoria Line]], which is in tunnel except for its depot, and the very short [[Waterloo & City Line]], which has no non-central part and no surface section. Only 45% of the Underground is in tunnel.

====South of the Thames====
The lack of lines south of the Thames is sometimes attributed to the [[geology]] of that area, the region being almost one large [[aquifer]]. Another reason is that during the great period of tube-building in the early 20th century south London was already well served by the efficiently-run suburban lines of the [[London and South Western Railway]] and the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]], then being electrified, which obviated Underground expansion into those areas.  (Railways to the north and west could focus on long-distance traffic, and so were less interested in the suburbs.) More recently, the [[Docklands Light Railway]], built to serve east London, has been extended to [[Lewisham]].  Of 33 [[London borough]]s, only [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[London Borough of Bexley|Bexley]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] - all south of the Thames - have no Underground stations.  



====International connections====
The Underground serves [[Waterloo station|Waterloo]], for [[Eurostar]] trains, and [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] Airport. The latter is slow (52 minutes nominal from [[Green Park tube station|Green Park]] via the Piccadilly Line) and often crowded, but is much cheaper than the [[Heathrow Express]].

==Ticketing==
{{main|London Underground ticketing}}

[[Image:London-underground-travelcard.jpg|thumb|London Underground One-Day Travelcard]]
The Underground uses TfL's [[Travelcard]] zones to calculate fares. [[Travelcard Zone 1]] is the most central, with a boundary just beyond the Circle Line, and [[Travelcard Zone 6|Zone 6]] is the outermost and includes [[London Heathrow Airport]]. Stations on the Metropolitan Line outside Greater London are in special Zones A to D.

There are staffed ticket offices, some open for limited periods only, and ticket machines usable at any time. Some machines that sell a limited range of tickets accept coins only, other touch-screen machines accept coins and English (but not [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] or [[Scotland|Scottish]]) [[British banknotes|bank notes]], and usually give change. These machines also accept major credit and debit cards: some newer machines accept cards only.

===Summary of ticket types===
The following tickets are available from '''London Underground''' and TfL ticket agents for use on the Underground:

Detailed information on tickets and fares is available from the [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/fares-tickets/2006/ Transport for London website].

===Penalty fares and fare evasion===
In addition to automatic and staffed ticket gates, the Underground is patrolled by both uniformed and plain-clothes ticket inspectors with hand-held [[Oyster card]] readers. Passengers travelling without a ticket valid for their entire journey are required to pay a <U+00A3>20 penalty fare or face prosecution for fare evasion. [[Oyster card|Oyster]] pre-pay users who have failed to 'touch in' at the start of their journey are also considered to be travelling without a valid ticket.  Fare evaders can be prosecuted under the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 and can face a fine of up to <U+00A3>1,000 or three months' imprisonment.

==Station access==
[[Image:Deep_level_escalator_at_bank.jpg|thumb|[[escalator|Escalators]] at [[Bank and Monument stations|Bank station]] on the Northern Line.]]
Accessibility by people with mobility problems was not considered when most of the system was built, and older stations are inaccessible to disabled people. Whilst recently-built stations have been designed for accessibility, retrofitting accessibility features to old stations is prohibitively expensive and technically extremely difficult due to the design issues mentioned above. Even when escalators and lifts are already fitted, there are often further flights of steps between the lift or escalator landings and the platforms.

TfL produces a map indicating which stations are accessible, and the more recent (2004) line maps indicate with a wheelchair symbol those stations that provide step-free access from street level. Step height from platform to train is up to 200&nbsp;[[millimetre|mm]], and there can be a large [[Mind the gap|gap]] between the train and curved platforms. Only the [[Jubilee Line Extension]] is completely accessible.  TfL's plan is that by 2020 there should be a network of over 100 fully accessible stations.  This consists of those already accessible (recently built or rebuilt, and a handful of suburban stations that happen to have level access) along with selected 'key stations', which will be rebuilt.  These key stations have been chosen due to high usage, interchange potential, and geographic spread, so that up to 75% of journeys will be achievable step-free. [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/using/getting-around/unlocking_london/mobilitycontents.asp]

While many stations on the surface involve a short flight of stairs to gain access from street level, virtually all underground stations use some of the system's 410 [[escalator]]s (each going at a speed of 145&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] per minute, approximately 1.65&nbsp;[[miles per hour]]) 112 [[elevator|lifts]], or a combination of both. There are also some lengthy walks and further flights of steps required to gain access to the correct platform once underground.

The escalators in Underground stations are among the longest in Europe and all are custom-built. They run 20 hours a day, 364 days a year and cope with 13,000 people per hour, with 95% of them operational at any one time. Convention and signage dictate that people using escalators on the Underground ''stand'' on the right-hand side, ''walk'' on the left.

==Safety==
[[Image:Westminster_underground.JPG|thumb|[[Westminster tube station|Westminster station]] &mdash; extensive support structures are required because [[Portcullis House]] is above.]]
The Underground has an excellent passenger safety record. Most fatalities on the network are suicides. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits beneath the track, originally constructed to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but they also help prevent death or serious injury when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train[http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/319/7215/957]. These pits are known colloquially as "suicide pits". Delays resulting from a person jumping or falling in front of a train as it pulls into a station are announced as "passenger action" or "a person under a train", and are referred to by staff as a "one under".

Relatively few accidents are caused by overcrowding on the platforms, and staff monitor platforms and passageways at busy times and prevent people entering the system if they become overcrowded. [[Camden Town tube station|Camden Town station]] is exit-only on Sunday afternoons (13:00&ndash;17:30) for this reason, and [[Covent Garden tube station|Covent Garden]] has access restrictions at times due to overcrowding.

[[Tobacco smoking|Smoking]] was banned on all trains in July 1984[http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/health/smoking_report.rtf ]. The ban was extended, for a six-month trial, to all parts of the Underground in summer 1987, and this was made permanent after the King's Cross fire in November 1987. Smoking anywhere on Underground stations and trains is punishable by a large fine.

While photography for personal use is permitted in public areas of the Underground
[http://tube-tfl.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/tube_tfl.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=GfElV__h&p_lva=&p_faqid=432], tripods and other supports are forbidden due to the often cramped spaces and crowds found underground. Flash is also forbidden due to its potential to distract drivers and disrupt fire-detection equipment. As their effects are often similar to those of flash, bright auto-focus assist lights should also be switched off or covered up when photographing the Underground.

There has been a number of derailments in recent years, none of which have resulted in serious injuries or loss of life.

The Underground's staff safety regimen has drawn criticism. In January 2002, the Underground was fined <U+00A3>225,000 for breaching [[Health and Safety Executive|safety standards for workers]]. In court, the judge reprimanded the company for ''"sacrificing safety"'' to keep trains running ''"at all costs."'' Workers had been instructed to work in the dark with the power rails live, even during rainstorms. Several workers had received electric shocks as a result. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/england/1752928.stm]

Due to a combination of the age of the system and significant under-funding in the past, some parts of the Underground's infrastructure are substantially older than their equivalents in other cities. Recently, one of the private infrastructure companies, Tube Lines, was reported to be using [[eBay]] to find spare parts for some of its equipment because they were not available any other way.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4079135.stm]

== The future ==
===Planned investment===
The UK government has promised <U+00A3>16 billion of funding until 2030, with early priorities to cut delays and improve reliability, including refurbishments of lifts and escalators, more thorough cleaning and a new station serving the new [[Wembley Stadium]]. The Victoria Line will receive new signalling systems and 47 new trains, and other lines will have renewal of track and equipment. The Jubilee Line received four new trains and 59 new carriages in December 2005, bringing the total to 63 seven-car sets, built by [[Alstom]]. It is also scheduled to receive <U+00A3>160 million for new signalling equipment from [http://www.alcatel.com/tas Alcatel Canada Transport Automation Solutions]. The Victoria Line and sub-surface lines will receive 1,738 new cars between 2008 and 2015, to be built in [[Derby]]. The Bakerloo Line will not receive new trains until 2019, with supplementary stock likely coming from the Victoria Line. The sub-surface lines will receive 190 new trains, built by Bombardier, meaning all trains will be of the same design, giving easier maintenance. New trains will feature inter-car gangways enhancing passenger safety, and improved acceleration and braking allowing an increase in train frequency, in the case of the Victoria Line from 28 trains per hour to 33. The last trains to be replaced, 75 District Line trains, are currently receiving interim refurbishment. 

[[Invensys|Westinghouse Rail Systems Ltd.]] will continue to supply signalling equipment; 75% of control equipment has been supplied by Westinghouse.

===Cooling===
In summer, temperatures on parts of the Underground can become very uncomfortable due to its deep and poorly ventilated tube tunnels: temperatures as high as 47<U+00B0>C were reported in the [[2006 European heat wave]] [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5191604.stm]. Conventional [[air conditioning]] has been ruled out on the deep lines because of the lack of space for equipment on trains and the problems of dispersing the waste heat these would generate. [[Heat pump]]s were [[Tottenham Court Road chiller|trialled]] in 1938 and have been proposed again recently to overcome this problem. Following a successful demonstration in 2001 funds were given to the School of Engineering at London's [[South Bank University]] to develop a prototype; work began in April 2002. A prize of [[Pound Sterling|<U+00A3>]]100,000 was offered by the [[Mayor of London]] during the hot summer of 2003 for a solution to the problem, but the competition ended in 2005 without a winner being announced. 

In 2011, new S-stock trains will be delivered to replace the current A, C and D stock trains on the Sub-Surface Lines (Metropolitan, Circle, H&C, East London Line and District Line). These will have standard air-conditioning, as the sub-surface tunnels are large enough to displace the exhausted hot-air. The new stock will start to be delivered in 2009. [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/39]

A year-long trial of a groundwater cooling system began in June 2006 at [[Victoria station (London)|Victoria station]]. If successful the trial will be extended to 30 other deep-level stations. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/5058362.stm] There are posters on the Underground suggesting that passengers carry a bottle of water to help keep cool.

===Planned and proposed extensions===
====Piccadilly Line extension to Terminal 5====
[[Image:Piccadilly T5 Extension.JPG|thumb|A diagram of the layout of the [[Piccadilly Line]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]] once the T5 Extension opens, at [[Ealing Broadway]] station.]]
A new station is being built on the Piccadilly Line to serve Terminal 5 of [[Heathrow Airport]]. The extension (called PiccEx) consists of a two-platform station, two sidings where trains can be stabled, approximately 3&nbsp;km of 4.5&nbsp;m diameter bored tunnels, a ventilation shaft and two escape shafts. Civil works for the two tunnels, the ventilation shaft, one escape shaft and the structure of [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|T5 station]] have been completed and track is being installed. The junction between PiccEx and the Heathrow Loop is being constructed: this work requires that the tunnel between [[Heathrow Terminal 4 tube station|Terminal 4]] and [[Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 tube station|Terminals 1,2,3]] be out of service until [[17 September]] [[2006]]. The extension is due to open in 2008[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/press-centre/metro/article.asp?id=1206]. Terminal 5 will be staffed by airport staff, trained and licensed by the Underground. Trains will run from Hatton Cross to platform 1 at Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3, thence to Terminal 5.

====East London Line extension====
Preparations are under way to extend the [[East London Line]] (ELL) both northwards and southwards. [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch station]] closed in June 2006 and the line north of [[Whitechapel tube station|Whitechapel]] will be diverted to run on the old [[Broad Street railway station|Broad Street]] viaduct - to Dalston and along the [[North London Line]] to [[Highbury & Islington station|Highbury & Islington]], to provide interchange with the [[Victoria Line]]. To the south, two branches are planned, mainly using existing railway lines. The first will run to [[West Croydon railway station|West Croydon]], with a spur to [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace]], the second to [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]]. However, the extension to Clapham Junction is currently unfunded.

The initial stations north of [[Whitechapel]] will be:
*[[Shoreditch High Street railway station|Shoreditch High Street]]
*[[Hoxton railway station|Hoxton]]
*[[Haggerston railway station|Haggerston]]
*[[Dalston Junction railway station|Dalston Junction]]

The East London Line will therefore become a more important transport artery, and when the extension is open it will be operated as part of the [[London Overground]], and will no longer be part of the Underground, although services will still be provided by Transport for London, and the line will almost certainly remain on the Tube map as the entire London Overground system is likely to be depicted there. If the extension to Clapham Junction is built, the London Overground system will contain the proposed 'Orbital Rail route' (see [[Orbirail]]).

====Bakerloo Line re-extension to Watford====
The [[Bakerloo line]] originally ran to [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]] via [[Watford High Street railway station|Watford High Street]], but was cut back to [[Harrow and Wealdstone station]] in late 1982. Recently plans for the re-extension have been approved as part of TfL's plans to manage some of North London's railways. However, when the re-extension will take place has not been disclosed. [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/66]

====Metropolitan Line works in Watford====
TfL, together with [[Hertfordshire]] [[County Council]], plans to connect the [[Watford]] branch of the [[Metropolitan Line]] to the disused [[Croxley Green]] National Rail branch, although it is most likely for the extension to join the branch between the abandoned [[Croxley Green railway station|Croxley Green]] and [[Watford West railway station|Watford West]] stations, with a new station being added at [[Ascot Road tube station|Ascot Road]] as a replacement for Croxley Green and Watford West being heavily refurbished. This will bring the Underground back to central Watford and the important main line station of [[Watford Junction station|Watford Junction]]. If this happens the current Watford (Metropolitan) station will close. [http://www.alwaystouchout.com/query/mode/Tube/]

=== Iconography ===
[[Image:way_out_tube.jpg|thumb|'Way Out' sign indicates the [[exit]] &mdash; these tiled signs are typical in stations designed by [[Leslie Green]], many of which survive.]] 
TfL's [[Tube map]] ([http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/pdfdocs/colourmap.pdf pdf]) and "[[roundel]]" [[logo]] are instantly recognisable by any Londoner, almost any Briton, and many people around the world. The original maps were often street-maps with the location of the lines superimposed, and the stylised Tube map evolved from a design[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/images/company/history/beckmap1.jpg] by electrical engineer [[Harry Beck]] in 1931. See [[Tube map]] for an in-depth analysis of its history and its [[topology|topological]] nature. The map has been such a successful concept that virtually every major urban rail system in the world now has a map in a similar stylised layout. Many bus companies have also adopted the concept.

====The roundel====
The origins of the [[roundel]], in earlier years known as the 'bulls-eye' or 'target', are more obscure. While the first use of a roundel in a London transport context was the 19th-century symbol of the [[London General|London General Omnibus Company]] <U+2014> a wheel with a bar across the centre bearing the word '''GENERAL''' <U+2014>  its usage on the Underground stems from the decision in 1908 to find a more obvious way of highlighting station names on platforms. The red disc with blue name bar was quickly adopted, with the word "U<small>NDERGROUN</small>D" across the bar, as an early corporate identity[http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/exhibitions/online_exhibitions/logo/index.html]. The logo was modified by [[Edward Johnston]] in 1919.

Each station displays the Underground roundel, often containing the station's name in the central bar, at entrances and repeatedly along the platform, so that the name can easily be seen by passengers on arriving trains. In addition, some stations' walls are decorated in [[tile]] motifs unique to that station, such as profiles of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'s head at [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]], and a cross containing a crown at [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]].

The roundel has been used for buses and the tube for many years, and since [[Transport for London|TfL]] took control it has been applied to other transport types (taxi, [[Tramlink|tram]], [[Docklands Light Railway|DLR]], etc.) in different colour pairs. The roundel has to some extent become a symbol for London itself.
[[Image:LU Leytonstone sign.jpg|thumb|The use of the roundel with the station name in the blue bar dates from 1908]]
===Typography===
Edward Johnston designed TfL's distinctive [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]], in 1916. A version of the typeface, modified to include lower case, continues in use today, and is called "[[Johnston (typeface)|New Johnston]]". The new typeface is noted for the curl at the bottom of the [[minuscule]] ''l'', which other sans-serif typefaces have discarded, and for the diamond-shaped [[tittle]] on the minuscule ''i'' and ''j'', whose shape also appears in the [[full stop]], and is the origin of other punctuation marks in the face. TfL owns the copyright to and exercises control over the New Johnston typeface, but a close approximation of the face exists in the [[TrueType]] computer font ''Paddington''.

===Unauthorised use===
[[Transport for London|TfL]] takes legal action against unauthorised use of its trademarks and of the Tube map, in spite of which unauthorised copies of the logo continue to crop up worldwide. Ranges of clothing and other accessories featuring TfL's graphic elements are available.

===Contribution to arts===

London Underground sponsors and contributes to the arts via its [[Platform for Art]] and [[Poems on the Underground]] projects. Poster and billboard space (and in the case of [[Gloucester Road tube station]], an entire disused platform) is given over to artwork and poetry to "create an environment for positive impact and to enhance and enrich the journeys of ... passengers".
