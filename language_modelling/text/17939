'''Maya Angelou''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|m|a<U+026A>|.|<U+0259>|_|<U+02C8>|<U+00E6>|n|d<U+0292>|<U+0259>|l|o<U+028A>}};<ref name="pronounce" /><ref name="glover" /> born '''Marguerite Ann Johnson'''; April 4, 1928)<ref name="gillespie-14" /> is an American author and poet. She has published six autobiographies, five books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning more than fifty years.  She has received dozens of awards and over thirty honorary doctoral degrees.  Angelou is best known for her series of autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences.  The first, ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' (1969), tells of her life up to the age of seventeen, and brought her international recognition and acclaim.

Angelou's list of occupations includes pimp, prostitute, night-club dancer and performer, castmember of the musical ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', coordinator for [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.'s]] [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], author, journalist in [[Egypt]] and [[Ghana]] during the days of decolonization, and actor, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs.  Since 1991, she has taught at [[Wake Forest University]] in [[Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]], where she holds the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies.  She was active in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]], and worked with both Martin Luther King and [[Malcolm X]].  Since the 1990s she has made around eighty appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties.  In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" at President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] inauguration, the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since [[Robert Frost]] at [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's]] inauguration in 1961.

With the publication of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', Angelou was one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. She is respected as a spokesperson of Black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of Black culture.  Although attempts have been made to ban her books from some US libraries, her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide.  Angelou's major works have been labeled as [[autobiographical fiction]], but many critics have characterized them as autobiographies.  She has made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.  Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family, and travel. Angelou is best known for her autobiographies, but she is also an established poet, although her poems have received mixed reviews.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Marguerite Johnson was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], on April 4, 1928,<ref name="gillespie-14" /> the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and a navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer.<ref name="lupton1-4" />  Angelou's older brother, Bailey Jr., nicknamed Marguerite "Maya", shortened from "My" or "Mya Sister".<ref name="cagedbird-67" />  When Angelou was three, and her brother four, their parents' "calamitous marriage"<ref name="cagedbird-6" /> ended.  Their father sent them to [[Stamps, Arkansas|Stamps]], [[Arkansas]] alone by train to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson.  In "an astonishing exception"<ref name="johnson-11" /> to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because "she made wise and honest investments".<ref name="lupton1-4" />{{refn|group=note|According to Angelou, Annie Henderson built her business with food stalls catering to Black workers, which eventually developed into a store.<ref name="journey-2124" />}}

| quote = And Angelou's life has certainly been a full one: from the hardscrabble Depression era South to pimp, prostitute, supper-club chanteuse, performer in ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', coordinator for [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.'s]] [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], journalist in Egypt and Ghana in the heady days of decolonization, comrade of [[Malcolm X]], eyewitness to the [[Watts riots]].  She knew King and Malcolm, [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Abbey Lincoln]].

Four years later, the children's father "came to Stamps without warning"<ref name="cagedbird-52" /> and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis.  At  the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman.  She confessed it to her brother, who told the rest of their family.  Freeman was found guilty, but was jailed for only one day.  Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles.  Angelou became mute for almost five years,<ref name="lupton1-5" /> believing, as she has stated, "I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name.  And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone&nbsp;..."<ref name="bbc" />  According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.<ref name="gillespie-22" />

Shortly after Freeman's murder, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother once again.<ref name="gillespie2122" />  Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again.  Flowers introduced her to authors such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Douglas Johnson (historian)|Douglas Johnson]], and [[James Weldon Johnson]], authors that would affect her life and career, as well as Black female artists like [[Frances Harper]], [[Anne Spencer]], and [[Jessie Fauset]].<ref name="cagedbird-13" /><ref name="gillespie-23" /><ref name="lupton1-15" />  When Angelou was 14, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again; she had since moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]].  During World War II, she attended [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] while studying dance and drama on a scholarship at the California Labor School.  Before graduating, she worked as the first Black female [[streetcar]] conductor in San Francisco.<ref name="gillespie-28" />  Three weeks after completing school, at the age of 17, she gave birth to her son, Clyde, who also became a poet.<ref name="cagedbird-279" /><ref name="difference" />{{refn|group=note|At the end of Angelou's third autobiography, ''[[Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas]]'', her son changed his name to "Guy Johnson".<ref name="lupton1-6" />}}

Angelou's second autobiography, ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', recounts her life from age 17 to 19 and "depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime."<ref name="lauret-120" />  Angelou worked as "the front woman/business manager for prostitutes,"<ref name="gillespie-29" /> restaurant cook, and prostitute.  She moved through a series of relationships, occupations, and cities as she attempted to raise her son without job training or advanced education.<ref name="lupton1-6" />

===Adulthood and early career: 1951<U+2013>61===
In 1951, Angelou married [[Greeks|Greek]] electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician Enistasious (Tosh) Angelos, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother.<ref name="hagen-xvi" /><ref name="gillespie2931" />  She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers [[Alvin Ailey]] and [[Ruth Beckford]].  Angelou and Ailey formed a dance team, calling themselves "Al and Rita", and performed [[Modern Dance]] at fraternal Black organizations throughout San Francisco, but never became successful.<ref name="journey-95" />  Angelou, her new husband, and son moved to New York City so that she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer [[Pearl Primus]], but they returned to San Francisco a year later.<ref name="gillespie3637" />
[[File:Miss_Calypso_album_cover_by_Maya_Angelou.jpg|thumb|right|Angelou's first album, ''Miss Calypso'' produced in 1957, was made possible due to the popularity of her nightclub act.]]
After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub [[The Purple Onion]], where she sang and danced [[calypso music]].<ref name="gillespie-38" />  Up to that point she went by the name of "Marguerite Johnson", or "Rita", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at The Purple Onion she changed her professional name to "Maya Angelou", a "distinctive name"<ref name="gillespie-41" /> that set her apart and captured the feel of her [[Calypso music|Calypso]] dance performances.  During 1954 and 1955 Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.  She began her practice of trying to learn the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages.<ref name="hagen9192" />  In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, ''[[Miss Calypso]]'', which was reissued as a CD in 1996.<ref name="heat" /><ref name="journey-95" /><ref name="gillespie-48" />  She appeared in an off-Broadway review that inspired the film ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'', in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions.<ref name="heat" />{{refn|group=note|Reviewer John M. Miller calls Angelou's performance of her song, "All That Happens in the Marketplace" the "most genuine musical moment in the film".<ref name="heat" />}}

Angelou met novelist [[James O. Killens]] in 1959, and at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career.  She joined the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], where she met several major African-American authors, including [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Rosa Guy]], [[Paule Marshall]], and [[Julian Mayfield]], and was published for the first time.<ref name="gillespie4951" />  After meeting and hearing civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speak in 1960, she and Killens organized "the legendary"<ref name="songbird" /> ''Cabaret for Freedom'' to benefit the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator.  According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and "eminently effective".<ref name="hagen-103" />  Angelou also began her pro-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] and anti-[[apartheid]] activism during this time.<ref name="gillespie-57" />

===Africa to ''Caged Bird'': 1961<U+2013>69===
[[File:Accra Skyline 1.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Most of Angelou's time in Africa was spent in [[Accra, Ghana]], shown here in 2008.|alt=View of Accra, Ghana from above.]]
In 1961, Angelou performed in [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks]]'', along with [[Abbey Lincoln]], [[Roscoe Lee Brown]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Louis Gossett]], [[Godfrey Cambridge]], and [[Cicely Tyson]].<ref name="gillespie-64" />  That year she met South African freedom fighter [[Vusumzi Make]]; they never officially married.<ref name="gillespie-59" />  She and her son Guy moved to [[Cairo]] with Make where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English-language newspaper ''The [[Arab Observer]]''.<ref name="gillespie-65" /><ref name="gillespie-71" />  In 1962 her relationship with Make ended, and she and Guy moved to [[Accra, Ghana]], he to attend college, where he was seriously injured in an automobile accident.{{refn|group=note|Guy Johnson, who as a result of this accident in Accra and one in the late 1960s, underwent a series of spinal surgeries.  He also, like his mother, became a writer and poet.<ref name="gillespie-156" />}}  Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965.  She became an administrator at the [[University of Ghana]], and was active in the African-American expatriate community.<ref name="gillespie-74" /><ref name="gillespie-75" />  She was a feature editor for ''[[The African Review]]'',<ref name="braxton-3" /> a freelance writer for the ''[[Ghanaian Times]]'', wrote and broadcast for [[Radio Ghana]], and worked and performed for Ghana's National Theatre.  She performed in a revival of ''The Blacks'' in Geneva and Berlin.<ref name="gillespie7980" />

In Accra, she became close friends with [[Malcolm X]] during his visit in the early 1960s.{{refn|group=note|Angelou called her friendship with Malcolm X "a brother/sister relationship".<ref name="interview"/>}}  Angelou returned to the U.S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization, the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]]; he was assassinated shortly afterward.  Devastated and adrift, she joined her brother in Hawaii, where she resumed her singing career, and then moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career.  She worked as a market researcher in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and witnessed the [[Watts riots|riots]] in the summer of 1965.  She acted in and wrote plays, and returned to New York in 1967.  She met her lifelong friend [[Rosa Guy]] and renewed her friendship with [[James Baldwin]], whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called "my brother",<ref name="boyd" /> during this time.  Her friend [[Jerry Purcell]] provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing.<ref name="gillespie8596" />

[[File:Maya_Angelou_and_James_Baldwin.jpg|thumb|right|Angelou's friend [[James Baldwin]] was instrumental in the publication of her first autobiography.]]
In 1968, Martin Luther King asked Angelou to organize a march.  She agreed, but "postpones again",<ref name="songbird" /> and in what Gillespie calls "a macabre twist of fate",<ref name="gillespie-98" /> he was assassinated on her 40th birthday (April 4).{{refn|group=note|Angelou did not celebrate her birthday for many years, choosing instead to send flowers to King's widow [[Coretta Scott King]].<ref name="80years" />}}  Devastated again, she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin.  As Gillespie states, "If 1968 was a year of great pain, loss, and sadness, it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou's spirit and creative genius".<ref name="gillespie-98" />  Despite almost no experience, she wrote, produced, and narrated "Blacks, Blues, Black!", a ten-part series of documentaries which dealt with the connection between [[blues]] music and Black Americans' African heritage, as well as what Angelou called the "Africanisms still current in the U.S."<ref name="south" /> for [[National Educational Television]], the precursor of [[PBS]].  Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with  Baldwin, cartoonist [[Jules Feiffer]], and his wife Judy, and challenged by [[Random House]] editor [[Robert Loomis]], she wrote her first autobiography, ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'', published in 1969, which brought her international recognition and acclaim.<ref name="smith" />

===Later career===
Angelou's ''[[Georgia, Georgia|Georgia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'', produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, the first screenplay written by a Black woman,<ref name="brown-2" /> was released in 1972.  She also wrote the film's soundtrack, despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie.<ref name="gillespie-105" />  Angelou married Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of [[Germaine Greer]], Paul du Feu, in San Francisco in 1973.  In the next ten years, as Gillespie has stated, "She had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime".<ref name="gillespie-119" />  She worked as a composer, writing for singer [[Roberta Flack]] and composing movie scores.  She wrote articles, short stories, TV scripts and documentaries, autobiographies and poetry, produced plays, and was named visiting professors of several colleges and universities.  She was "a reluctant actor",<ref name="gillespie-110" /> and was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] in 1973 for her role in ''Look Away''.  In 1977 Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini-series ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]''.  She was given hundreds of [[List of awards and nominations received by Maya Angelou|awards]] during this period, including over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world.<ref name="smithsonian" />

In the late '70s, Angelou met [[Oprah Winfrey]] when Winfrey was a [[TV anchor]] in Baltimore, Maryland; Angelou would later become Winfrey's close friend and mentor.<ref name="oprah" />{{refn|group=note|Angelou dedicated her 1993 book of essays ''[[Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now]]'' to Winfrey.<ref name="journey-x" />}}  In 1981, Angelou and du Feu divorced.  She returned to the southern United States in 1981, where she accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of [[American Studies]] at [[Wake Forest University]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]], and she taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[science]], [[theater]], and writing.<ref name="glover" /><ref name="gillespie-126" />

[[File:Maya Angelou speech for Barack Obama campaign 2008.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Maya Angelou speaking at a rally for Barack Obama, 2008]]

In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" at the inauguration of President [[Bill Clinton]], becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since [[Robert Frost]] at [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's]] inauguration in 1961.<ref name="wordsmith" />  Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal "across racial, economic, and educational boundaries".<ref name="berkman" />  The recording of the poem was awarded a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name="gillespie-142" />  In June 1995, she delivered what Richard Long called her "second 'public' poem",<ref name="long-84" /> entitled "A Brave and Startling Truth", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the [[United Nations]].  Angelou finally achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996, ''[[Down in the Delta]]'', which featured actors such as [[Alfre Woodard]] and [[Wesley Snipes]].<ref name="gillespie-144" />  Since the 1990s, Angelou has actively participated in the lecture circuit<ref name="wordsmith" /> in a customized tour bus, something she continued into her eighties.<ref name="younge" /><ref name="gillespie-9" />  In 2000, she created a successful collection of products for [[Hallmark]], including [[greeting cards]] and decorative household items.<ref name="gillespie-10" /><ref name="williams" />  Over thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story, she completed the sixth and final autobiography in her series of six, ''[[A Song Flung Up to Heaven]]'', in 2002.<ref name="gillespie-175" />

Angelou campaigned for Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|in the 2008 presidential primaries]].<ref name="80years" /><ref name="clinton" />  When Clinton's campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Senator [[Barack Obama]],<ref name="80years" /> who won the election and became the first African American president of the United States.  She stated, "We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism".<ref name="parker" />  In late 2010, Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]] in [[Harlem]].<ref name="waldron" />  They consisted of over 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', a 1982 telegram from [[Coretta Scott King]], fan mail, and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis.<ref name="schomburg" />

===Personal life===
Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the [[Mende people]] of West Africa.<ref name="mende" />{{refn|group=note|In her fifth autobiography ''[[All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes]]''(1987), Angelou recounts being identified, on the basis of her appearance, as part of the [[Bambara people]], a subset of the Mande.<ref name="traveling-206207" />}}  A 2008 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], became pregnant by her former white owner, John Savin.  Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child.  After  indicting Savin for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite discovering that Savin was the father, a [[grand jury]] found him not guilty.  Lee was sent to the Clinton County [[poorhouse]] in [[Missouri]] with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother.  Angelou described Lee as "that poor little Black girl, physically and mentally bruised."<ref name="marylee" />

The details of Angelou's life described in her six autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tend to be inconsistent.  Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou has spoken about her life, she has done so eloquently but informally and "with no time chart in front of her".<ref name="lupton1-2" />  For example, she has been married at least twice, but has never clarified the number of times she has been married, "for fear of sounding frivolous";<ref name="younge" /> according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1973, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him.  Angelou has one son Guy, whose birth was described in her first autobiography, one grandson, and two young great-grandchildren,<ref name="gillespie-156" /> and according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family.{{refn|group=note|See Gillespie et al., pp. 153<U+2013>175.}}  Angelou's mother Vivian Baxter and brother Bailey Johnson, Jr., both of whom were important figures in her life and her books, have died;  her mother in 1991 and her brother in 2000 after a series of strokes.<ref name="gillespie-155" />  In 1981, the mother of her son Guy's child disappeared with him; it took eight years to find Angelou's grandson.<ref name="gillespie-129" />{{refn|group=note|In Angelou's essay, "My Grandson, Home at Last", published in ''[[Woman's Day]]'' in 1986, she describes the kidnapping and her response to it.<ref name="lupton1-19" />}}

According to Gillespie, it has been Angelou's preference that she be called "Dr. Angelou" by people outside of her family and close friends.  As of 2008, she owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and one in [[Harlem]], full of her "growing library"<ref name="gillespie-150" /> of books she has collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens.  According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem, including Thanksgiving;<ref name="gillespie-162" /> "her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend<U+2014>from haute cuisine to down-home comfort food".<ref name="gillespie-9" />  She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book ''Hallelujah! The Welcome Table'', which featured recipes she learned from her grandmother and mother, connected with stories.<ref name="pierce" />

Beginning with ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', Angelou has used the same "writing ritual"<ref name="lupton1-15" /> for many years.  She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls.  She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play [[solitaire]], ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', and the [[Bible]], and would leave by the early afternoon.  She would average 10<U+2013>12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening.<ref name="sarler" />  Angelou went through this process to "enchant" herself, and as she has said in a 1989 interview with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], "relive the agony, the anguish, the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]''."<ref name="bbc" />  She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences like her rape in ''Caged Bird'', in order to "tell the human truth"<ref name="bbc" /> about her life.  Angelou has stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment, in order to access her memories more effectively.  She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it<U+2014>ha!  It's so delicious!"<ref name="bbc" />  She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in "telling the truth".<ref name="bbc" />

==Works==
{{Main|List of Maya Angelou works}}

Angelou has written a total of six autobiographies.  According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's third autobiography ''[[Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas]]'' marked the first time a well-known African American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life.<ref name="lupton1-98" />  Her books "stretch over time and place", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S., and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]<ref name="lupton1-1" />  Critics have tended to judge Angelou's subsequent autobiographies "in light of the first",<ref name="poetry" /> with ''Caged Bird'' receiving the highest praise.  Angelou has written five collections of essays, which writer Hilton Als called her "wisdom books" and "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts".<ref name="songbird" />  Angelou has used the same editor throughout her writing career, [[Robert Loomis]], an executive editor at [[Random House]], who retired in 2011<ref name="italie" /> and has been called "one of publishing's hall of fame editors."<ref name="arnold" />  Angelou has said regarding Loomis: "We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers".<ref name="tate-155" />

Angelou's long and extensive career also includes poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking.

===Influence===
[[File:Angelou Obama.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Barack Obama]] presenting Angelou with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], 2011]]
When ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life.  According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote.<ref name="songbird" />  Scholar John McWhorter agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called "tracts", as "apologetic writing".  He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of Black culture, which he called "a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period".<ref name="mcwhorter-40" />  Writer Julian Mayfield, who called ''Caged Bird'' "a work of art that eludes description",<ref name="songbird" /> has argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent not only for other black women writers, but for African American autobiography as a whole.  Als has said that ''Caged Bird'' marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense".<ref name="songbird" />  Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women.<ref name="poetry" />  It made her "without a doubt,&nbsp;... America's most visible black woman autobiographer",<ref name="braxton-4" /> and "a major autobiographical voice of the time".<ref name="long-85" />  As writer Gary Younge has said, "Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work".<ref name="younge" />

Author [[Hilton Als]] has said that although ''Caged Bird'' was an important contribution to the increase of black [[feminist]] writings in the 1970s, he attributed its success less to its originality than with "its resonance in the prevailing [[Zeitgeist]]",<ref name="songbird" /> or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]].  Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, has freed many other female writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".<ref name="songbird" />  Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton has stated that ''Caged Bird'' was "perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing" autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era.<ref name="braxton-4" />

===Critical reception===

Reviewer Elsie B. Washington, most likely due to President Clinton's choice of Angelou to recite her poem "On the Pulse of Morning" at his 1993 inauguration, has called Angelou "the black woman's poet laureate".<ref name="washington-56" />  Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300<U+2013>600% the week after Angelou's recitation.  [[Bantam Books]] had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand.  [[Random House]], which published Angelou's hardcover books and published the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase.<ref name="brozan" />  Angelou has famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, "I agree with [[Balzac]] and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money'".<ref name="younge" />

Angelou's books, especially ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves.  According to the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], parents and schools have objected to ''Caged Bird's'' depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence.<ref name="banned" /> Some have been critical of the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions.<ref name="foerstel" />  ''Caged Bird'' appeared third on the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990<U+2013>2000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000<U+2013>2009 list.<ref name="library1" /><ref name="library2" />

===Awards and honors===
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Maya Angelou}}

For her work, Angelou has been honored by universities, literary organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups.  Her honors have included a [[National Book Award]] nomination for ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]],'' a [[Pulitzer Prize]] nomination for her book of poetry, ''Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie,''<ref name="moyer-297" /> a [[Tony Award]] nomination for her role in the 1973 play ''Look Away'', and three [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] for her spoken word albums.<ref name="maughan" /><ref name="tonys" /> In 1995, Angelou's publishing company, [[Random House]], recognized her for having the longest-running record (two years) on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Paperback Nonfiction Bestseller List.<ref name="bioinfo" />  She has served on two presidential committees,<ref name="woolley" /><ref name="poetry" /> and was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 2000,<ref name="natlmedal" /> the Lincoln Medal in 2008,<ref name="lincoln" /> and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2011.<ref name="presmedal" />  Angelou has been awarded over thirty honorary degrees.<ref name="smithsonian" />

===Uses in education===

Angelou's autobiographies have been used in [[narrative]] and [[multicultural]] approaches in [[teacher education]].  Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at [[George Washington University]], has trained teachers how to "talk about race" in their classrooms with ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' and ''Gather Together in My Name''.  According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony, have led readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she "left out" and how they should respond to the events Angelou described.  Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism has forced white readers to explore their feelings about race and their own "privileged status".  Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her [[literary techniques]], readers have tended to react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".<ref name="glazier" />

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book, ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood'', analyzed the events in ''Caged Bird'' to illustrate resiliency in children.  Challener argued that Angelou's book has provided a "useful framework" for exploring the obstacles many children like have Maya faced and how communities have helped children succeed as Angelou did.<ref name="challener" />  Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using ''Caged Bird'' to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of [[child development]] topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence.  He found the book a "highly effective" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.<ref name="boyatzis" />

==Style and genre in autobiographies==
{{Main|Themes in Maya Angelou's autobiographies}}
Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of [[autobiographical fiction]].<ref name="lupton1-2930" />  As feminist scholar Maria Lauret has stated, Angelou has made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.<ref name="lauret-98" />  Scholar Mary Jane Lupton has argued that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.<ref name="lupton1-32" />  Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agreed, stating that Angelou has tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth",<ref name="lupton1-34" /> which has paralleled the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the [[abolitionist]] period of U.S. history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection.<ref name="lupton1-34" /><ref name="sartwell-26" />  Scholar Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but claimed that Angelou has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.<ref name="hagen67" />

According to African American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor [[Robert Loomis]] was able to dare her into writing ''Caged Bird'' by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered "high art".<ref name="protest-92" />  Angelou has acknowledged that she has followed the slave narrative tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".<ref name="poetry" />  Scholar John McWhorter called Angelou's books "tracts"<ref name="mcwhorter-40" /> that defended African-American culture and fought against negative stereotypes.  According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seemed to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of Black culture.  McWhorter saw Angelou as she depicted herself in her autobiographies "as a kind of stand-in figure for the Black American in Troubled Times".<ref name="mcwhorter-40" />  Although McWhorter saw Angelou's works as dated, he recognized that "she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves.<ref name="mcwhorter-41" />  Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom has compared Angelou's works to the writings of [[Frederick Douglass]], stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe Black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences.<ref name="bloom-17" />

According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, whereas Angelou's poetry could be placed within the African-American oral tradition, her prose "follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms".<ref name="oneale-32" />  O'Neale stated that although Angelou avoided a "monolithic Black language",<ref name="oneale-34" /> she accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale called a "more expected ghetto expressiveness".<ref name="oneale-34" />  McWhorter found both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience.  As McWhorter stated, "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is".<ref name="mcwhorter-39" />  McWhorter asserted, for example, that Angelou's depiction of key figures like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian did not speak as one would expect, and that their speech was "cleaned up".<ref name="mcwhorter-38" />  Guy, for example, represented the young Black male, while Vivian represented the idealized mother figure. The stiff language Angelou used, both in her text and in the language of her subjects, was intended to prove that Blacks were able to competently use standard English.<ref name="mcwhorter4041" />

McWhorter recognized that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the "apologetic" nature of her writing.<ref name="mcwhorter-40" />  When Angelou wrote ''Caged Bird'' at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was "organic unity", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criteria.<ref name="protest-92" />  The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology.  Instead, they were placed to emphasize the [[Themes in Maya Angelou's autobiographies|themes of her books]],<ref name="protest-93" /> which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that "Angelou's poetry and prose are similar".  They both relied on her "direct voice", which alternated steady rhythms with [[syncopated]] patterns and used  similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird).<ref name="sayers" />  According to Hagen, Angelou's works have been influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community.  For example, she referenced over 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry.<ref name="hagen-63" />  In addition, she used the elements of [[blues music]], including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations.<ref name="hagen-61" />  Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.<ref name="lupton1-142" />

==Poetry==

Although Angelou considered herself a playwright and poet when her editor [[Robert Loomis]] challenged her to write ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'',<ref name="protest-91" /> she is best known for her autobiographies.  According to Lupton, many of Angelou's readers identify her as a poet first and an autobiographer second.<ref name="lupton1-17" />  Reviewer Elsie B. Washington has called her "the black woman's [[poet laureate]]", and has called Angelou's poetry the anthems of African Americans.<ref name="washington-56" />  Angelou has experienced similar success as a poet as she did as an autobiographer.  She began, early in her writing career, of alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry.<ref name="hagen-118" />  Her first volume of poetry ''[[Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie]]'', published in 1971 shortly after ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' became a best-seller, was nominated for a [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name="gillespie-103" />

[[File:Martin Luther King Jr NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|175px|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  Critics have stated that Angelou's poetry evokes the African-American oral tradition as exemplified by King.|alt=Black-and-white photo of an African American man, wearing a coat and tie, making an open-handed gesture.]]

Angelou's most famous poem was "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]", which she recited at the inauguration of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993.  Lupton has argued that "Angelou's ultimate greatness will be attributed" to the poem, and that Angelou's "theatrical" performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked a return to the African-American oral tradition of speakers such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref name="lupton1-17" />  Angelou delivered what Richard Long called her "second 'public' poem",<ref name="long-84" /> entitled "A Brave and Startling Truth", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the [[United Nations]] in 1995.  Also in 1995, she was chosen to recite one of her poems at the [[Million Man March]].<ref name="lupton1-18" />  In 2009, Angelou wrote "We Had Him", a poem about [[Michael Jackson]], which was read by [[Queen Latifah]] at his funeral.<ref name="jackson" />

As Gillespie has stated, Angelou had "fallen in love with poetry in Stamps, Arkansas".<ref name="gillespie-101" />  After her rape at the age of eight, she memorized and studied great works of literature, including poetry, and according to ''Caged Bird'', her friend Mrs. Flowers encouraged her to recite them, which helped bring her out of her muteness.<ref name="cagedbird-98" />  Gillespie has also stated that Angelou's poems "reflect the richness and subtlety of Black speech and sensibilities" and were meant to be read aloud.<ref name="gillespie-103" /> Angelou has supported Gillespie, telling an interviewer in 1983 that she wrote poetry so that it would be read aloud.<ref name="toppman-142" />

Scholar Zofia Burr has connected Angelou's "failure to impress professional poetry critics"<ref name="burr-181" /> to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal performed one. Critic James Finn Cotter, in his review of Angelou's 1976 volume of poetry ''Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well'', called it an "unfortunate example of the dangers of success".<ref name="burr-181b" />  Critic John Alfred Avant, despite the fact that the volume was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, stated that ''Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'Fore I Diiie'' "isn't accomplished, not by any means".<ref name="burr-182" />

Scholar Joanne Braxton has asserted that "Angelou's audience, composed largely of women and blacks, isn't really affected by what white and/or male critics of the dominant literary tradition have to say about her work. This audience does not read literary critics; it does read Maya Angelou".<ref name="braxton2-7" />  Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: "to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional".<ref name="burr-183" />
