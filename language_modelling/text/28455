It served as a vehicle for [[Lyndon LaRouche]] to run for [[President of the United States]] in 1976, but it also sponsored many candidates for local offices and Congressional and Senate seats between 1972 and 1979. After that the political arm of the NCLC was the '''National Democratic Policy Committee'''. The party was the subject of a number of controversies and lawsuits during its short existence.

== Party objectives and ideology==
The USLP is described in LaRouche's r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9> as "an independent political association committed to the tradition of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Henry Charles Carey|Henry C. Carey]], and President [[Abraham Lincoln]]."<ref>[http://www.larouchepub.com/resume.html Lyndon LaRouche Biography<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> LaRouche describes it in another location as "a new [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] association," adding that an important objective of the party was to fight against "the attempted revival of the 'preventive nuclear war' organization, the revived [[Committee on the Present Danger]]."<ref>{{cite news| date=July 9, 2004 |work=Executive Intelligence Review|title=Hans Koschnick Poses A Question Which the July Democrats Must Also Answer|first= Lyndon H. |last=LaRouche, Jr.|url=http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2004/3127hans_koschnick.html}}</ref> A state leader described the aims of the party and its organ, ''New Solidarity'', as supporting the working class against capitalism, Nelson Rockefeller, and [[Leonard Woodcock]], head of the [[United Auto Workers]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Labor Party campaigns|first=Jim|last=Leman|work=Anderson Daily Bulletin|date=November 1, 1974|page=3}}</ref>

LaRouche critic and biographer [[Dennis King]] says that when the USLP sponsored LaRouche's 1976 campaign, the NCLC was still in transition from a far-left to far-right ideology<ref name="king001" />  but by 1977-78 both organizations (which were really one and the same for all essential purposes) were advocating extreme-right positions. King described a typical post-transition USLP campaign in "Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism" (Doubleday, 1989):

<blockquote>''In Baltimore, USLP candidate Debra Freeman appealed openly to racist and anti-Semitic sentiments in her 1978 campaign against incumbent Congressman [[Parren Mitchell]], chairman of the [[Congressional Black Caucus|Black Congressional Caucus]]. Freeman, who is white, described Mitchell as a '[[house nigger]]' for Baltimore's 'Zionists' and an example of 'bestiality' in politics....She won more than 11 percent of the vote, doing especially well in several white precincts.''<ref name="king002">King, Dennis. ''Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism'' (Doubleday, 1989)</ref></blockquote>

Similar language had been used by the NCLC as early as 1974, when an alderman in Madison, Wisconsin, was called a "house nigger" at a city council meeting.<ref>{{cite news|title=Labor Committee Here

The USLP predicted collapse of the monetary system by November 1976 and thermonuclear war by 1977.<ref name="CQ"/>  It was opposed to the [[Rockefeller family]] and had a reputation for harassing the [[Communist Party]], the [[United Auto Workers]], and other political foes.<ref name="CQ"/> 
In a 1974 interview, the USLP candidate for Governor of Michigan said that the [[Watergate scandal]] was a "deliberate attempt" to discredit [[Richard Nixon]] and weaken the presidency.<ref>{{cite news|title=Candidate Blasts Rockefellers|work= The News-Palladium|location=Benton Harbor, Michigan| date=October 11, 1974|page=8}}</ref>

== History ==

===1972&ndash;1976===
An early target of the USLP's attention was [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the former Governor of New York who was nominated to be Vice President by [[Gerald Ford]] in 1974. During the Senate's confirmation hearings, LaRouche appeared on behalf of the USLP as a witness against Rockefeller's nomination. He testified that a USLP survey showed 90 percent of U.S. workers and the unemployed hated Rockefeller.<ref>{{cite news|title=Audit Delays Rockefeller Vote|page=4|title=The Capital Times, |date=September 27, 1974}}</ref>

In 1974 the Wisconsin branch of the Labor Party took out a newspaper advertisement announcing that it had filed for an injunction to prevent the CIA, FBI, and the New York Police Department from arresting Lyndon LaRouche (then known as Lyn Marcus) or anyone involved in the movement's kidnapping of Christopher White, who had married LaRouche's former common-law wife. According to detailed descriptions by LaRouche, White had been [[brainwashed]] by the CIA and KGB to kill him.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/main.htm</ref> The advertisement further reported that the movement had found a cure for [[psychosis]] and encouraged [[mental health professional]]s to contact them to develop this discovery.<ref>{{cite news|title=International Caucus Of Labour Committees| author=The Madison Labor Committee|date=January  13,1974|work=Wisconsin State Journal|section=5|page=22}}</ref>

USLP member Harley Schlanger, a candidate for the House of Representative, sued the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, [[ABC stores|ABC liquor board]] in August 1976, for prohibiting campaigning on their property, which he contended was public property. The North Carolina [[ACLU]] joined the suit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Labor Party Sues ABC Board|page=2B |work=High Point Enterprise|date= August 24, 1976}}</ref> The district court judge decided that the activity was protected free speech that could not be prohibited so long as activists did not block doorways.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC board checks

===Presidential campaign===
In an appearance on "Meet the Press" with other minor party candidates in October 1976, LaRouche predicted monetary collapse followed by thermonuclear war before summer if [[Jimmy Carter]] were elected.<ref>{{cite news|page=B10|work=IDaho State Journal |location=Pocatello, Idaho| October 18, 1976|title=Both Ford, Carter Slow Down Campaigns to Catch Breaths|first=Robert B. |last =Cullen}}</ref>
He described Ford as "weak but well-meaning".<ref>{{cite news|title=Brand X candidates plug away|location=Butte-Anaconda, Montana|date= October 18, 1976|work=The Montana Standard}}</ref>

On November 1, the eve of the election, the USLP purchased a half hour block of time on [[NBC]], the first of many national broadcasts by LaRouche that would follow in election years to come. The time was purchased over the objection of the network which unsuccessfully appealed the last-minute purchase to the [[Federal Election Commission]]. During the broadcast, which ran opposite a similar advertisement from  Carter on another network, LaRouche said that Carter would have the U.S "irreversibly committed to nuclear war by no later than November of 1977" if elected. According to LaRouche's autobiography, he
{{blockquote|...blew the policy of [[James R. Schlesinger]], for an early nuclear confrontation with Moscow, and exposed the genocidal policies which key Carter backers, such as [[George Ball]], had publicly demanded as measures for drastic population reduction of nations such as [[Mexico]]. More broadly, I presented a policy of international monetary reform, as alternative to a deepening crisis in the developing sector...<ref> LaRouche, Lyndon, ''The Power of Reason:1988'', Executive Intelligence Review, 1987</ref>}}
NBC reported receiving hundreds of calls protesting the broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=Attack on Carter protested|work=Corpus Christi Times|date=November 2, 1976|page=5B}}</ref>

LaRouche's name was on the ballot in 23 states plus the [[District of Columbia]] on November 2, 1976.  He received 40,043 votes (0.05%). U.S. Labor Party candidates sometimes received unusually high vote totals in comparison with those garnered by other small ideologically-based parties.<ref name="king001">King, Dennis. "NCLC Makes Election Inroads." ''Our Town'' (part 6 in a 12-part series, 1979<U+2013>1980)</ref> 

Following the election, the USLP brought lawsuits in three states challenging the Carter's victory. The the Republican Party joined the suits in Ohio and New York. Regional coordinator Paul Greenberg sought a recount in Milwaukee, saying "the election has actually been stolen <U+2014> the actual winner was probably Jerry Ford."<ref>{{cite news|title= Carter Victory Faces Challenge in 3 States|work=Bridgeport Telegram|date=December 2. 1976|page=41}}</ref>

===1977&ndash;1982===
In August 1977, the USLP said that the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) was intentionally harassing the group as a result of a determination that forgiven debts were the equivalent of campaign contributions.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Labor Party charges federal harassment|work=VALLEY NEWS|date=August 26, 1977|location=Van Nuys, Calif|page=17}}</ref> The same month the USLP hired a former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative, mercenary, firearms engineer and arms dealer, Colonel [[Mitch WerBell]], to protect LaRouche. They said that LaRouche, then living in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, was being targeted for assassination by the [[Red Army Faction|"Baader-Meinhof Gang"]], allegedly on behalf of the Carter administration. Werbell in turn recruited the chief of police from his town, [[Powder Springs, Georgia]], to set up the security.<ref>{{cite news|title=Small town police fall into international mystery|first=Charles |last=Hayslett|work=The News|location=Port Arthur, Texas|date=August 5, 1977|page 12}}</ref>

In 1978, LaRouche began a vigorous USLP campaign for the presidency in 1980, targeting [[farmer]]s, [[small business]]men and [[Teamsters Union]] members in the [[Heartland]] states. 

In May 1978, USLP Steering Committee member Elliott Eisenberg campaigned in a Chicago suburb, saying that "the reason we picked Schaumburg is because it's a relatively conservative area ... There's more of a tendency for people to support nuclear power."<ref>{{cite news|itile=Labor Party cause on street}first=Paul|last=Cokes|work=The Daily Herald|date=May 24, 1978|page=I5}}</ref>

The USLP vice-presidential candidate, Khushro Ghandhi, campaigned in June 1979 and predicted victory based on support from the [[Teamsters]] (a faction of the union had ties to LaRouche). Running on a pro-nuclear power platform, Ghandhi said that the recent [[Three Mile Island accident]] was ordered by Energy Secretary [[James R. Schlesinger]] in order to create a false energy crisis.<ref>{{cite news|title=Labor Party supports power|work=Syracuse Herald-Journal|date= June 1, 1979|page=26N}}</ref>

By late summer of 1979 the NCLC and LaRouche had decided to join the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] so that LaRouche could run for that party's presidential nomination, and the US Labor Party was disbanded. 
In 1982 the USLP was sued for $1.5 million in damages by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' when one of its employees allegedly impersonated a reporter.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A14FB345D0C738EDDA10894DA484D81 "Magazine Sues U.S. Labor Party Over Impersonation Of A Reporter"] AP. ''[[New York Times]]''. New York, N.Y.: August 20, 1982. pg. D.16</ref> The magazine won an injunction against the party publications. Lyndon LaRouche, when asked about the matter, said, "I don't know anything about it and I never looked into it, but I do know that the liberal press uses undercover press practices that are abhorrent and beneath description."<ref>{{cite news|first= Patricia|last=Lynch|title=Is Lyndon LaRouche using your name?|work=Columbia Journalism Review|pages=42-46|date=March/April 1985}}</ref>

==National Democratic Policy Committee==
The National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a [[political action committee]], is regarded as the successor to the USLP.<ref>"KLENETSKY OPPOSES MOYNIHAN WITH UNUSUAL LIST OF CHARGES" LYNN, FRANK. New York Times. (Late Edition (East Coast)). New York, N.Y.: September 20, 1982. pg. B.6</ref> LaRouche's politics were not shared by many in the Democratic Party, allowing him to occupy a niche with little competition.<ref name="king002" /> In 1986, the NDPC is reported to have fielded candidates in "146 congressional races, 14 Senate contests, seven governors' contests and more than 600 state legislative and party posts."<ref>"S.
