'''Berkeley Software Distribution''' ('''BSD''', sometimes called '''Berkeley Unix''') is the [[Unix]] derivative distributed by the [[University of California, Berkeley]], starting in the [[1970s]]. The name is also used collectively for the modern descendants of these distributions. 

BSD is one of several branches of Unix operating systems. Another one is evolved from [[UNIX System V]] developed by [[AT&T]]'s Unix System Development Labs.  A third consists of the [[Linux|GNU/Linux]] operating systems which draw from Unix System V and BSD, as well as [[Plan9]], and non-UNIX operating systems.

BSD was widely identified with the versions of Unix available for [[workstation]]-class systems. This can be attributed to the ease with which it could be licensed and the familiarity it found among the founders of many technology companies during the [[1980s]]. This familiarity often came from using similar systems&mdash;notably [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[Ultrix]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[SunOS]]&mdash;during their education. While BSD itself was largely superseded by the [[UNIX System V|System V Release 4]] and [[OSF/1]] systems in the [[1990s]] (both of which incorporated BSD code), in recent years modified [[Open-source software|open source]] versions of the codebase (mostly derived from 4.4BSD-Lite) have seen increasing use and development.

==History==
[[Image:Unix_history-simple.svg|thumb|[[Unix]], filiation on Unix systems.]]

===PDP-11 beginnings===
The earliest distributions of Unix from [[Bell Labs]] in the [[1970s]] included the [[source code]] to the operating system, allowing researchers at [[university|universities]] to modify and extend Unix.  The first Unix system at Berkeley was a [[PDP-11]] installed in [[1974]], and the [[computer science]] department used it for extensive research thereafter.

Other universities became interested in the software at Berkeley, and so in [[1977]] [[Bill Joy]], then a graduate student at Berkeley, assembled and sent out tapes of the '''first Berkeley Software Distribution''' ('''1BSD''').  1BSD was an add-on to [[Sixth Edition Unix]] rather than a complete operating system in its own right; its main components were a [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]] [[compiler]] and Joy's [[ex (editor)|ex]] [[line editor]].

The '''Second Berkeley Software Distribution''' ('''2BSD'''), released in [[1978]], included updated versions of the 1BSD software as well as two new programs by Joy that persist on Unix systems to this day: the [[vi]] text editor (a [[visual editor|visual]] version of ex) and the [[C shell]].

Later releases of 2BSD contained ports of changes to the [[VAX]]-based releases of BSD back to the PDP-11 architecture. 2.9BSD from [[1983]] included code from 4.1cBSD, and was the first release that was a full OS (a modified [[Version 7 Unix]]) rather than a set of applications and patches. The most recent release, '''2.11BSD''', was first released in [[1992]], with maintenance updates from volunteers continuing until [[2006]] ([ftp://sg-1.ims.ideas.gd-ais.com/pub/2.11BSD/445 patch 445] was released on December 26, 2006).

===VAX versions===
A [[VAX]] computer was installed at Berkeley in [[1978]], but the [[porting|port]] of Unix to the VAX architecture, [[UNIX/32V]], did not take advantage of the VAX's [[virtual memory]] capabilities.  The [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of 32V was largely rewritten by Berkeley students to include a virtual memory implementation, and a complete operating system including the new kernel, ports of the 2BSD utilities to the VAX, and the utilities from 32V was released as '''3BSD''' at the end of [[1979]]. 3BSD was also alternatively called Virtual VAX/UNIX or VMUNIX (for Virtual Memory Unix), and BSD kernel images were normally called <tt>/vmunix</tt> until 4.4BSD.

The success of 3BSD was a major factor in the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]]'s (DARPA) decision to fund Berkeley's [[Computer Systems Research Group]] (CSRG), which would develop a standard Unix platform for future DARPA research in the [[VLSI Project]]. CSRG released '''4BSD''', containing numerous improvements to the 3BSD system, in October [[1980]].

'''4BSD''' (November [[1980]]) offered a number of enhancements over 3BSD, notably [[job control]] in the previously-released [[C Shell|csh]], [[delivermail]] (the antecedent of [[sendmail]]), "reliable" [[signal (computing)|signals]], and the [[Curses (programming library)|Curses]] programming library.

'''4.1BSD''' (June [[1981]]) was a response to criticisms of BSD's performance relative to the dominant VAX operating system, [[OpenVMS|VMS]].  The 4.1BSD kernel was systematically tuned up by [[Bill Joy]] until it could perform as well as VMS on several benchmarks.  (The release would have been called ''5BSD'', but the name was changed to avoid confusion with [[AT&T]]'s [[UNIX System V]] release. One early, never-released test version was in fact called 4.5BSD.)

'''4.2BSD''' would take over two years to implement and contained several major overhauls.  Before its official release came three intermediate versions: ''4.1a'' incorporated a modified version of [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman|BBN's]] preliminary [[TCP/IP]] implementation; ''4.1b'' included the new [[Berkeley Fast File System]], implemented by [[Marshall Kirk McKusick]]; and ''4.1c'' was an interim release during the last few months of 4.2BSD's development.

The official 4.2BSD release came in August [[1983]].  It was notable as the first version released after the [[1982]] departure of Bill Joy to co-found [[Sun Microsystems]]; [[Mike Karels]] and [[Marshall Kirk McKusick]] took on leadership roles within the project from that point forward.  On a lighter note, it also marked the debut of [[BSD Daemon|BSD's daemon mascot]] in a drawing by McKusick that appeared on the cover of the printed manuals distributed by [[USENIX]].

===4.3BSD===
'''4.3BSD''' was released in June [[1986]].  Its main changes were to improve the performance of many of the new contributions of 4.2BSD that had not been as heavily tuned as the 4.1BSD code.  Prior to the release, BSD's implementation of TCP/IP had diverged considerably from BBN's official implementation.  After several months of testing, DARPA determined that the 4.2BSD version was superior and would remain in 4.3BSD.  (See also [[History of the Internet]].)

After 4.3BSD, it was determined that BSD would move away from the aging VAX platform.  The [[Computer Consoles Inc.#Power 5 and Power 6 computers|Power 6/32]] '''platform''' (codenamed "Tahoe") developed by [[Computer Consoles Inc.]] seemed promising at the time, but was abandoned by its developers shortly thereafter.  Nonetheless, the '''4.3BSD-Tahoe''' port (June [[1988]]) proved valuable as it led to a separation of machine-dependent and machine-independent code in BSD which would improve the system's future portability.

Until this point, all versions of BSD had incorporated proprietary AT&T Unix code and therefore required licenses from AT&T for their use.  Source code licenses had become very expensive by this point, and several outside parties had expressed interest in a separate release of the networking code, which had been developed entirely outside AT&T and would not be subject to the licensing requirement.  This led to '''Networking Release 1''' ('''Net/1'''), which was made available to non-licensees of AT&T code and was [[free software|freely redistributable]] under the terms of the permissive [[BSD license]].  It was released in June [[1989]].

'''4.3BSD-Reno''' came in early [[1990]].  It was an interim release during the early development of 4.4BSD, and its use was considered a "gamble", hence the naming after the [[gambling]] center of [[Reno, Nevada]]. This release was clearly moving towards [[POSIX]] compliance, and, according to some, away from the BSD philosophy (as POSIX is very much based on System V, and Reno was quite bloated compared to previous releases).

In August 2006, ''Information Week'' magazine rated 4.3BSD as the "Greatest Software Ever Written"[http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=191901844], commenting that "BSD 4.3 represents the single biggest theoretical undergirder of the Internet."

===Net/2 and legal troubles===
After Net/1, BSD developer [[Keith Bostic]] proposed that more non-AT&T sections of the BSD system be released under the same license as Net/1.  To this extent, he started a project to reimplement most of the standard Unix utilities without using the AT&T code.  For example, [[vi]], which had been based on the original Unix version of [[ed (Unix)|ed]], was rewritten as [[nvi]] (new vi).  Within eighteen months, all the AT&T utilities had been replaced, and it was determined that only a few AT&T files remained in the kernel.  These files were removed, and the result was the June [[1991]] release of '''Networking Release 2 (Net/2)''', a nearly complete operating system that was freely distributable.

Net/2 was the basis for two separate ports of BSD to the [[Intel 80386]] architecture: the free [[386BSD]] by [[William Jolitz]] and the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[BSD/OS|BSD/386]] (later renamed BSD/OS) by [[Berkeley Software Design]] (BSDi).  386BSD itself was short-lived, but became the initial code base of the [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] projects that were started shortly thereafter.

BSDi soon found itself in legal trouble with AT&T's [[Unix System Laboratories]] subsidiary, then the owners of the System V [[copyright]] and the Unix [[trademark]].  The ''[[USL v. BSDi]]'' lawsuit was filed in [[1992]] and led to an [[injunction]] on the distribution of Net/2 until the validity of USL's copyright claims on the source could be determined.

The lawsuit slowed development of the free-software descendants of BSD for nearly two years while their legal status was in question, and as a result systems based on the [[Linux kernel]], which did not have such legal ambiguity, gained greater support.  [[Linux]] and [[386BSD]] began development at about the same time, and [[Linus Torvalds]] has said that if there had been a free [[Unix-like]] operating system on the 386 at the time, he likely would not have created Linux.   Although it is debatable exactly what effect that would have had on the software landscape since, there is little doubt that it would have been substantial.

===4.4BSD and descendants===
''See also: [[Comparison of BSD operating systems]]''

The lawsuit was settled in January [[1994]], largely in Berkeley's favor.  Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only 3 had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices.  A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the Berkeley-owned code in the upcoming 4.4BSD release.

In June [[1994]], '''4.4BSD''' was released in two forms: the freely distributable '''4.4BSD-Lite''' contained no AT&T source, whereas '''4.4BSD-Encumbered''' was available, as earlier releases had been, only to AT&T licensees.

The final release from Berkeley was [[1995]]'s '''4.4BSD-Lite Release 2''', after which the CSRG was dissolved and development of BSD at Berkeley ceased.  Since then, several distributions based on 4.4BSD (such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]]) have been maintained.

In addition, the permissive nature of the BSD license has allowed many other operating systems, both free and proprietary, to incorporate BSD code.  For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] has used BSD-derived code in its implementation of TCP/IP and bundles recompiled versions of BSD's [[command line]] networking tools with its current releases. Also [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the system on which Apple's [[Mac OS X]] is built, is partly derived from FreeBSD 5.  Various commercial [[Unix|UNIXes]], such as [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]], also contain varying amounts of BSD code.

==Technology==
BSD pioneered many of the advances of modern computing.  Berkeley's Unix was the first Unix to include libraries supporting the [[Internet Protocol]] stacks: ''[[Berkeley sockets]]''.  By integrating sockets with the Unix operating system's [[file descriptor]]s, it became almost as easy to read and write data across a [[computer network|network]] as it was to access a disk. The AT&T laboratory eventually released their own [[STREAMS]] library, which incorporated much of the same functionality in a software stack with a better architecture, but the wide distribution of the existing sockets library, together with the unfortunate omission of a function call for polling a set of open sockets equivalent to the <tt>select</tt> call in the Berkeley library, reduced the impact of the new [[Application programming interface|API]].

Today, BSD continues to be used as a testbed for technology by academic organizations, as well as finding uses in a lot of commercial and free products and, increasingly, in [[Embedded system|embedded devices]]. The general quality of its source code, as well as its documentation (especially reference manual pages, commonly referred to as ''[[Unix manual|man pages]]''), make it well-suited for many purposes.

The permissive nature of the [[BSD license]] allows companies to distribute derived products as [[proprietary software]] without exposing source code and sometimes [[intellectual property]] to competitors. Searching for strings containing "University of California, Berkeley" in the documentation of products, in the static data sections of [[Executable|binaries]] and [[Read-only memory|ROMs]], or as part of other information about a software program, will often show BSD code has been used. This permissiveness also makes BSD code suitable for use in [[open source]] products, and the license is compatible with many other [[open source license]]s.

BSD operating systems can run much native software of several other operating systems on the same [[Computer architecture|architecture]], using a binary [[compatibility layer]]. Much simpler and faster than [[emulation]], this allows, for instance, applications intended for [[Linux]] to be run at effectively full speed. This makes BSDs not only suitable for server environments, but also for workstation ones, given the increasing availability of commercial or closed-source software for Linux only. This also allows administrators to migrate legacy commercial applications, which may have only supported commercial Unix variants, to a more modern operating system, retaining the functionality of such applications until they can be replaced by a better alternative.

Current BSD operating system variants support many of the common [[IEEE]], [[ANSI]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and [[POSIX]] standards, while retaining most of the traditional BSD behavior. Like [[AT&T Unix]], the BSD kernel is [[monolithic kernel|monolithic]], meaning that device drivers in the kernel run in [[privileged mode]], as part of the core of the operating system. Early versions of BSD were used to form [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[SunOS]], founding the first wave of popular Unix workstations.

==Significant BSD descendants==
:''See also: [[:Category:BSD]] and [[Comparison of BSD operating systems]]''
BSD has been the base of a large number of operating systems. Most notable among these today is perhaps the major [[open source]] BSDs, [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]<U+2014>sometimes known as ''the BSDs''<U+2014>which have themselves spawned a number of children, including [[DragonFly BSD]], [[FreeSBIE]], [[MirOS BSD]], [[DesktopBSD]], and [[PC-BSD]]. They are targeted at an array of systems for different purposes and are common in government facilities, universities and in commercial use. A number of commercial operating systems are also partly or wholly based on BSD or its descendants, including [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[SunOS]] and [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Mac OS X]]. A selection of significant Unix versions and [[Unix-like]] operating systems that descend from BSD includes:

* [[FreeBSD]], a major open source effort focusing on performance and the [[x86]] platform, and [[DragonFly BSD]], a fork of FreeBSD to follow an alternative design, particularly related to [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]]
* [[NetBSD]], an open source BSD with an emphasis on portability and clean design
* [[OpenBSD]], a 1995 [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of NetBSD, focuses on portability, security, standardization and correctness
* [[PC-BSD]] and [[DesktopBSD]], variants of FreeBSD with emphasis on ease of use and user friendly interfaces for the desktop/laptop PC user
* [[Tru64 UNIX]] (formerly DEC OSF/1 AXP or Digital UNIX), the port of [[OSF/1]] for [[DEC Alpha]]-based systems from [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[Compaq]] and [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]].
* [[Juniper Networks]] [[JunOS]], the operating system for Juniper routers, a customized version of FreeBSD, and a variety of other embedded operating systems
* [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]], the core of [[Mac OS X]]; built on the [[XNU|XNU kernel]] (part Mach, part FreeBSD, part Apple-derived code) and a userland much of which comes from [[FreeBSD]]
* Early versions of [[Sun Microsystems]] [[SunOS]] (up to SunOS 4.1.4), an enhanced version of 4BSD for the Sun [[Motorola]] [[68k]]-based [[Sun-2]] and [[Sun-3]] systems, [[SPARC]]-based systems, and [[x86]]-based [[Sun386i]] systems.
* DEC's [[Ultrix]], the official version of Unix for its [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], and [[DECstation]] systems
*[[OSF/1]], a [[microkernel]]-based UNIX developed by the [[Open Software Foundation]], incorporating the [[Mach kernel]] and parts of 4BSD
* [[DEMOS]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] BSD clone
* [[NeXT]] [[NEXTSTEP]] and [[OpenStep|OPENSTEP]], based on the Mach kernel and 4BSD; the ancestor of [[Mac OS X]]
* [[386BSD]], the first open source BSD-based operating system and the ancestor of most current BSD systems
* [[BSD/OS]], a (now defunct) proprietary BSD for PCs
