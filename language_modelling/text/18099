'''Category 6 cable''', commonly referred to as '''Cat-6''', is a cable standard for [[Gigabit Ethernet]] and other [[network protocol]]s that is [[backward compatible]] with the [[Category 5 cable|Category 5/5e]] and [[Category 3 cable]] standards.  Cat-6 features more stringent specifications for [[crosstalk]] and system noise.  The cable standard provides performance of up to 250 MHz and is suitable for [[10BASE-T]] / [[100BASE-TX]] and [[1000BASE-T]] / [[1000BASE-TX]]  (Gigabit Ethernet). It is expected to suit the [[10 gigabit Ethernet|10GBASE-T]] (10Gigabit Ethernet) standard, although with limitations on length if unshielded Cat 6 cable is used.  Category 6 cable can be identified by the printing on the side of the cable sheath.<ref>[http://donutey.com/ethernet.php Ethernet Cable Identification and Use]</ref>

The cable contains four [[twisted pair | twisted copper wire pairs]], just like earlier copper cable standards. Although Cat-6 is sometimes made with 23 [[Wire gauge|gauge]] wire, this is not a requirement; the [[TIA/EIA-568-B|ANSI/TIA-568-B.2-1]] specification states the cable may be made with 22 to 24 [[American_wire_gauge|AWG]] wire, so long as the cable meets the specified testing standards. When used as a patch cable, Cat-6 is normally terminated in [[8P8C]] modular connectors, often incorrectly referred to as "[[Registered jack|RJ-45]]" electrical connectors. Cat-6 connectors are made to higher standards that help reduce noise caused by crosstalk and system interference. [[Attenuation]], [[NEXT]] (Near End Crosstalk), and [[PSNEXT]] (Power Sum NEXT) are all significantly lower when compared to Cat-5/5e.

Some Cat-6 cables are too large and may be difficult to attach to [[8P8C]] connectors without a special modular piece and are technically not standard compliant. If components of the various cable standards are intermixed, the performance of the signal path will be limited to that of the lowest category. The maximum allowed length of a Cat-6 cable is {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.

The cable is terminated in either the T568A scheme or the T568B scheme. It doesn't make any difference which is used, as they are both straight through (pin 1 to 1, pin 2 to 2, etc). Mixing T568A-terminated patch cords with T568B-terminated horizontal cables (or the reverse) does not produce pinout problems in a facility. Although it may vary slightly or sometimes degrade signal quality, this effect is marginal and certainly no greater than that produced by mixing cable brands in-channel.
The T568B Scheme is by far the most widely used method of terminating patch cables.

[[Ethernet crossover cable|Crossover]] is used for hub to hub, computer to computer, wherever two-way communication is necessary.
All gigabit ethernet equipment, and most new 10/100Mb equipment, supports [[Auto-MDIX|automatic crossover]], meaning that either a straight-through or crossover cable may be used for any connection.
However, older equipment requires the use of a straight-through cable to connect a switch to a client device, and a crossover cable to connect a switch to a switch or a client to a client.
Crossover cables can be constructed by wiring one end to the T568A scheme and the other end with the T568B scheme.
This will ensure that the Transmit (TX) pins on both ends are wired through to the Receive (RX) pins on the other end.

==Category 6a==

The latest standard from the [[Telecommunications Industry Association|TIA]] for enhanced performance standards for twisted pair cable systems was defined in [[February 2008]] in ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B.2-10.  '''Category 6a''' (or '''Augmented Category 6''') operates at frequencies up to 500 MHz<U+2014>twice that of Cat 6.

Cat6a can support 10 Gbit/s applications (especially [[10GBaseT#10GBASE-T|10GBaseT]]) up to a maximum distance of {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.

Improved specifications, particularly in the area of Alien Cross-talk (AXT).
