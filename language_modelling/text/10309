"'''Break Your Heart'''" is a song by British recording artist [[Taio Cruz]]. It was written by Cruz and Fraser T. Smith and produced by Smith. The song serves as the [[lead single]] from his sophomore album, ''[[Rokstarr]]''. It was first released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on September 20, 2009, followed by a release in the United States and other markets in early 2010. The official remix version features American rapper [[Ludacris]] and that version was the single released in North American countries. The song, originally penned for [[Cheryl Cole]], is an uptempo [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[dance-pop|dance]] song accompanied by Cruz's [[auto-tune|auto-tuned]] vocals. The song is lyrically a warning to someone about being a heartbreaker. 

The song received mixed to positive reviews, critics commending its infectious sound, but noting that it was generic. The song peaked at number one in Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, and also within the top ten of many other countries. The accompanying music video features several scenes of Cruz on escapades with different women, including a speedboat compared to classic [[Diddy]] and a club scene with Ludacris in the American version.

==Background==
"Break Your Heart" was one of two penned by Cruz for UK pop/R&B singer [[Cheryl Cole]] for her debut solo studio album, ''[[3 Words (album)|3 Words]]''.<ref name="COLE">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/taio-cruz/news/157386-taio-cruz-talks-cheryl-and-sugababes|title=Taio Cruz Talks Cheryl And Sugababes|date=2009-09-30|work=''[[MTV News|MTV News UK]]''|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref> After Cruz did not hear back from Cole's label about "Break Your Heart", Cruz reworked the song for a male and made it the first song off his sophmore album, ''Rokstarr''.<ref name="COLE"/> Cruz told ''[[MTV News|MTV News UK]]'' that after he released the song, Cole's people would have liked the song for her after all.<ref name="COLE"/> The latter track by Cruz, "Stand Up" made it onto the final tracklist on Cole's album.<ref name="COLE"/> 

However, according to the song's other co-writer [[Fraser T. Smith]] in an interview with ''[[HitQuarters]]'', "Break Your Heart" was rejected by Cole's [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] label boss Ferdy Unger-Hamilton felt it was too similar to "[[Heartbreaker (will.i.am song)|Heartbreaker]]" by [[will.i.am]], the executive producer of ''3 Words''.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Fraser_T_Smith_Interview.html |title=Interview With Fraser T Smith |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> 

===Writing and remix version===
Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told ''Blues & Soul'', <blockquote>"Its about breaking a girl's heart, but in a way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about <U+2013> but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/456/taio_cruz_rokstarr_in_the_making|title=TAIO CRUZ: ROKSTARR IN THE MAKING|work=''Blues and Soul''|accessdate=2010-05-10}}</ref></blockquote> Cruz also has called his song "catchy" with a "good melody" and "fun topic", stating that "both girls and guys can get into this character".<ref name="EW">{{cite web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/03/03/taio-cruz-interview/|title=Taio Cruz talks 'Break Your Heart', his new album and getting 'Dirty' with Ke$ha|first=Adam|last=Markovitz|date=2010-03-03|accessdate=2010-05-12|work=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref>In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Cruz elaborated and said they song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an "exaggeration of an experience".<ref name="EW"/> 

In addition to re-working his album for an American release, Cruz tapped American rapper [[Ludacris]] on a remix of the American version of the song. On collaborating with [[Ludacris]], Cruz said, "With Ludacris, pretty much every track he's ever featured on sounds amazing. I gave him a quick call and asked him if he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great <U+2014> so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1634365/20100319/_kesha_.jhtml|title=Taio Cruz Talks Collaborating With Ludacris, Ke$ha|date=2010-03-19|accessdate=2010-05-10|work=''[[MTV News]]''|publisher=MTV Networks|first=Akshay|last=Bhansali}}</ref> The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the [[b-side]] to "[[No Other One (song)|No Other One]]" in November 2009 before digitally in Canada  of the song featuring rapper [[Ludacris]] was released digitally as the b-side to "[[No Other One (song)|No Other One]]" in November 2009.<ref name="UKRL">{{cite web|url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/no-other-one-ep/id340278665|title=No Other One - Single by Taio Cruz|publisher=[[iTunes|UK iTunes]]|accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>, before in the United States in February 2010.<ref name="USDL"/>

Michael Menachem of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said that the "stateside version" turns up the heat with Ludacris' feature as "Cruz's breezy vocals on this electro-pop number have all the warmth of smooth R&B, while producer Fraser T. Smith sets up the right ratio of catchy vocals and tempo changes to make a hit".<ref name="BILLBOARDREVIEW"/> Ash Dosanjh of ''[[New Musical Express]]'' said that Cruz's downfall was when he acts the player, as on "Break Your Heart" and "[[Dirty Picture]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/taio-cruz/10933|title=Album review: Taio Cruz - 'Rokstarr'|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2010-05-12|work=''[[NME]]'|first=Ash|last=Dosanjh}}</ref> Caroline Sullivan of ''[[guardian.co.uk|The Guardian]]'' said Cruz was "proficient but generic" in the song, but his "autotuned vocals could have been anyone's, and this facelessness is a problem Cruz rarely surmounts."<ref name="GUARDIAN"/> Chris Ryan of ''[[MTV News|MTV Buzzworthy]]'' said that the song "perfectly embodies Cruz's infectious, dancefloor-friendly sound and sleek, immaculate production", and compares it to [[Jason Der<U+00FC>lo]] and [[Akon]].<ref name="BUZZWORTHY">{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/03/12/the-buzz-on-taio-cruz/|title=The Buzz On Taio Cruz|first=Chris|last=Ryan|date=2010-03-12|accessdate=2010-05-12|work=''[[MTV News|MTV Buzzworthy]]''|publisher=MTV Networks}}</ref>

==Music video==
[[File:Breakyourheartvideo.jpg|thumb|188px|left|Cruz and his love interest on a speedboat in the music video.]]
The original music video was filmed in [[Marbella]], [[Spain]] in July 2009 with new parts filmed in [[Miami, Florida]] in February 2010 to include model Nadya Nepomnyashaya and [[Ludacris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in4merz.com/releasestaio/2513-important-taio-cruz-dates.html|title=Important Taio Cruz Dates|work=In4merz Magazine|accessdate=2010-05-29}}</ref> The video features Cruz addressing his girlfriend at the beginning of the video, with him her the he is a heartbreaker, and she challenging him.

Ludacris' scenes for the U.S. video feature Cruz and Ludacris in a white concrete backdrop with a flashing light, and a club scene. When asked if an old-school [[Diddy]] was an influence on the video, Cruz said, "Probably on some kind of subconscious level. I just love supermodels, I love sunshine, and I love sports cars. And this time we also added a speedboat. So you go the four S<U+2019>s in there."<ref name="EW"/> In an interview with ''[[Rap-Up]]'', when talking about the video portraying him as a heartbreaker, Cruz said, "No, not really. I suppose maybe 20%. It was more of just playing a character and having fun, just going out there and making a real cool, fun, cocky video. Not everyone has seen the whole plot of the video, but it<U+2019>s actually myself and my girlfriend both going out with the intention of breaking everyone<U+2019>s hearts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/05/26/10-questions-for-taio-cruz/comment-page-1/#comment-339186|title=10 Questions for Taio Cruz|accessdate-2010-05-29|work=[[Rap-Up]]|first=Jordan|last=Upmalis}}</ref>
