The '''2011 Giro d'Italia''' was the 94th&nbsp;edition of the [[Giro d'Italia]], one of cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]]. The Giro started on 7&nbsp;May with a [[team time trial]] in [[Turin]] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of [[Italian unification]], when the city served as the first capital of the single state.<ref>{{cite web |title=2011 Giro d'Italia to start in Turin with team time trial|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/493427/2011-giro-d-italia-to-start-in-turin-with-team-time-trial.html|date=29 July 2010|publisher=Cycling Weekly |accessdate=25 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100831034307/http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest/493427/2011-giro-d-italia-to-start-in-turin-with-team-time-trial.html| archivedate= 31 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The route was one of the most difficult in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week long race. Of the seven stages categorized as high mountain, six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at [[Grossglockner]] in Austria, the exceptionally steep [[Monte Zoncolan]], and a tall and steep peak near the [[Fascia Valley]] in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the [[Nevegal]]. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.

In the third stage, {{ct|LEO|2011}} rider [[Wouter Weylandt]] crashed coming down the [[Passo del Bocco]], near the town of [[Mezzanego]], suffering catastrophic injury. Despite substantial resuscitation efforts, he was established to have died on the spot. The fourth stage was not competitively raced; instead, it was run as a cycling procession. On the second rest day, [[Xavier Tond<U+00F3>]], a member of {{ct|MOV|2011}}, was killed in an accident at his home. Although he was not a participant, his death also had an impact on the race, as his teammates and other members of the peloton paid tribute to him in the subsequent stages.

Strong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] was the race's original winner, in what constituted his second Giro championship. His winning margin ahead of second-placed [[Michele Scarponi]] was over six minutes. He also won the points competition as the most consistent high finisher, also with a substantial lead over Scarponi in second place, and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] completed the podium. In the other sub-classifications, [[Stefano Garzelli]] won the mountains competition and [[Roman Kreuziger]] finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification; he finished the race fifth overall.

In February 2012, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] decided that Contador, following his [[2010 Tour de France#Alberto Contador|positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France]], lost his results since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, and the winner of the points classification.<ref name="cascontador">{{cite news|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cas-sanction-contador-with-two-year-ban-in-clenbuterol-case|title=CAS sanctions Contador with two year ban in clenbutorol case|date=6 February 2012|accessdate=6 February 2012|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|work=Cyclingnews}}</ref>

Two stages in the second half of the Giro had their courses altered shortly before they were run. The more notable was stage 14, which had been hyped as the debut of the [[Monte Crostis]] in the Giro d'Italia. Commissaires from the UCI mandated it be removed the night before stage 14 was run. The Crostis is not a well-maintained pass, and Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol wherein team cars would not follow the race up or down the mountain, and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders. Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal, and this was given as the basis of the UCI's decision. They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course, but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race. Thus, the Crostis was eliminated, and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of {{convert|210|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web

However, protests from spectators disappointed by the removal of the Crostis part of the route, including many who had volunteered for works to make parts of that road safe, led to the cancellation of the Tualis climb. The route was diverted while the stage was in progress to avoid a small village at the foot of the Tualis where protesters had gathered.<ref>{{cite web

The course was shortened by {{convert|5.5|km|1|abbr=on}} four days before the stage took place, due to a special election taking place in Milan the same day as the stage. City officials expected high voter turnout and did not want the city center tied up by the race all day, so the revised route began at the outskirts of Milan instead of its center. It still ended, per its original design, at the [[Duomo di Milano]].<ref>{{cite web

The Giro began with a [[team time trial]] in the city that served as Italy's first federal capital, [[Turin]]. The {{ct|THR|2011}} squad won this stage, making their rider [[Marco Pinotti]] the first wearer of the race leader's pink jersey.<ref>{{cite web

The peloton chose not to run stage four competitively following Weylandt's death; instead the stage was ridden as a procession in his memory. The remaining members of his team {{ct|LEO|2011}}, as well as training partner [[Tyler Farrar]] from the {{ct|GRM|2011}} squad, crossed the finish line first with their arms around one another before withdrawing from the race that evening. Stage 5 was held on the dirt roads of [[Tuscany]], which had provided for one of the more spectacular stages in the [[2010 Giro d'Italia]]. Dutch rider [[Pieter Weening]] won the stage with an 8-second time gap against the field. That, coupled with the 20-second time bonus for winning the day, gave him the pink jersey.<ref name="CN stage 5">{{cite web

Stage 9 was the first major mountain stage, featuring two ascents of [[Mount Etna]], including a summit finish. It was on this day that strong overall favorite [[Alberto Contador]] first seized control of the race. Just after {{ct|AND|2011}}'s [[Jos<U+00E9> Rujano]] attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification.<ref>{{cite web

As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey. The Spaniard himself hinted that such a move would be in his plans.<ref>{{cite web

While {{ct|GRM|2011}}'s [[Christophe Le M<U+00E9>vel]], who entered the day third overall and had on two other occasions come within a time bonus of claiming the jersey, made the group, neither he nor anyone in it was destined to take pink. Largely under the impetus of [[Michele Scarponi]]'s {{ct|LAM|2011}} team, the breakaway group was caught before the finish. Contador and the rest of the overall favorites finished at the front of the race, with riders well down in the standings claiming the time bonuses, meaning Contador retained the race leadership after all.<ref name="CN stage 11">{{cite web

Contador took the most time against the main field out of any day in stage 13. On this day, which ended at the [[Grossglockner]] in Austria, he and Rujano again finished well ahead of the main field. As they approached the finish line, Contador did not attempt to sprint for the win, allowing Rujano to take it. Their minute and a half time gap, plus the time bonus for second place, gave Contador a lead of over three minutes in the overall standings.

On 23 May, during the second rest day of the Giro, [[Xavier Tond<U+00F3>]], the reigning [[Vuelta a Castilla y Le<U+00F3>n]] champion and one of the leaders on the season for the {{ct|MOV|2011}}, was killed in a freak accident at home while preparing to train with teammates.

Despite not taking part in this edition of the Giro, Tond<U+00F3> had taken part in the 2010 edition and was a popular, well-liked rider. Race leader and eventual winner [[Alberto Contador]], along with many others, rode the stage 16 individual time trial with black armbands. The stage was preceded by a minute of silence. Tond<U+00F3>'s teammate [[Branislau Samoilau]] posted a time that was provisionally best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who won the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tond<U+00F3>, as the two were acquainted despite never having been teammates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.velonation.com/News/ID/8539/Giro-dItalia-Alberto-Contador-dominates-in-stage-sixteens-uphill-test.aspx | title=Alberto Contador dominates in stage sixteen's uphill test | work=VeloNation | author=VeloNation Press | publisher=VeloNation LLC | date=24 May 2011 | accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>

They issued the number for the Belgian national road race championships.<ref>{{cite web

A further month later, RCS Sport, owners of the race, confirmed that Zomegnan had been removed from his largely autocratic position as race director. He was replaced by RCS general director Michele Acquarone and Mauro Vegni, along with a team of former professional riders. Zomegnan remains as an RCS consultant and director of the [[2013 UCI Road World Championships]] in Florence. Zomegnan had held the position since 2004, beginning with the [[2005 Giro d'Italia]].<ref>{{cite web

==Contador's results stripped==
[[Alberto Contador]] rode the Giro with full knowledge that he was to answer to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS) regarding [[Alberto Contador#2010 Tour de France|his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France]], since [[Royal Spanish Cycling Federation|his national federation]] cleared him of doping charges but both the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained from the time of that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made [[Michele Scarponi]] the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made [[Jos<U+00E9> Rujano]] and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] into stage winners in this Giro.<ref>{{cite web

The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that [[strict liability]] rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.<ref>{{cite web

Scarponi, as well as [[John Gadret]], the rider elevated onto the podium now in third place overall, both expressed sympathy for Contador and the feeling that being awarded these prestigious results in a court of law nearly a year after the race concluded kept them from feeling as good as they would were they attained on the road. Both Scarponi's overall championship and Gadret's podium finish constituted the first such results for either of them in a Grand Tour. Gadret, who had supported Contador's presence in the Giro peloton when the race began, reconsidered his position in hindsight, saying the Spaniard's attendance irrevocably changed the race.<ref>{{cite web

== Classification leadership ==
[[File:Giro 2011-maglie.jpg|thumb||right|alt=Four cycling jerseys <U+2013> pink, green, white, and red, from left to right <U+2013> are arranged on mannequin torsos in front of a pink wall.|The Giro's four special jerseys on display in Milan before the final podium presentations.]]

In the 2011 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the [[general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.<ref name="demystified">{{cite web|author=Laura Weislo|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2008/giro08/?id=/features/2008/giro_classifications08|title=Giro d'Italia classifications demystified|date=13 May 2008|work=Cycling News|publisher=Future Publishing Limited|accessdate=27 August 2009}}</ref>

Additionally, there was a [[points classification]], which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known [[points classification in the Tour de France]], the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer <U+2013> each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25&nbsp;points, second place earned 20&nbsp;points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.<ref name="demystified" /> 

There was also a [[mountains classification]], the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The ''Cima Coppi'', the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.<ref name="demystified" />

The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1986 were eligible.<ref name="demystified" />

There were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20&nbsp;placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team;<ref name="demystified" /> and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements. 

The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run, and shows to whom each jersey would have been awarded each day had [[Alberto Contador]] been removed from the standings as the race was ongoing.

===Minor classifications===
Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour.<ref name="demystified" /> Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the ''Traguardo Volante'', or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based.<ref name="demystified" /> It was won by [[Jan Bakelants]] of the {{ct|OLO|2011|nolink=yes}} team.<ref name="finalstandings" />

Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes.<ref name="demystified" /> Original general classification winner [[Alberto Contador]] won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner [[Stefano Garzelli]].<ref name="finalstandings" /> The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were only awarded for the top three finishers in each stage.<ref name="demystified" /> It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to [[Jos<U+00E9> Rujano]] when the Spaniard's results were stripped.<ref name="finalstandings" /> Additionally, the ''Trofeo Fuga Pinarello'' rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear.<ref name="demystified" /> {{ct|RSH|2011|nolink=yes}}'s [[Yaroslav Popovych]] was first in this competition.<ref name="finalstandings" /> Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements.<ref name="demystified" /> Six different teams <U+2013> {{ct|LIQ|2011}}, {{ct|AND|2011}}, {{ct|THR|2011}}, {{ct|QST|2011}}, {{ct|BMC|2011}}, and {{ct|CSF|2011}} <U+2013> avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.<ref name="finalstandings" />

===World Rankings points===
The Giro was one of 27&nbsp;events throughout the season that contributed points towards the [[2011 UCI World Tour]]. Points were awarded to the top 20&nbsp;finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.<ref>{{cite web

In early 2012, the points earned by Contador for overall placing were redistributed, and those gained for stage finishes were removed.  Riders from non-World Tour teams, who were not initially allocated points, received them.
