'''''Un chien andalou''''' (''An Andalusian Dog'' in English) is a 16 minute [[surrealist]] short [[film]] made in [[France]] by [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]] (Writer/Director) and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]] in [[1929]]. It is one of the best known surrealist films of the 1920s French [[avant-garde]] film movement. It stars [[Simone Mareuil]] and [[Pierre Batcheff]] as the unnamed protagonists.

==Synopsis==
Describing ''Un chien andalou'' is difficult because the film has no "plot" in the strict sense of the word.  In terms of its structure, it is at least as [[nonlinear]] as any film ever made.  It uses dream logic that can be described in terms of [[Freudian]] [[free association]].  The film is a series of apparently unrelated, and at times potentially offensive, scenes that attempt to shock the viewer. It also features surprising camera angles and other film tricks.

The film opens with a scene in which a woman's eye is slit by a razor (the man with the razor is played by Bu<U+00F1>uel himself), and continues with a series of surreal scenes, including the following:

* an androgynous woman pokes at a severed hand in the street with her cane
* a man drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys, the tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], and two live priests (Dal<U+00ED> plays one of the priests in this scene)
[[Image:Dali_Priest_Un_chien_andalou.PNG|170px|thumb|Salvador Dali playing a priest in one of the scenes]]
* a man's hand has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge. The French phrase "ants in the palms," (which means that someone is "itching" to kill) is shown literally.
* a woman's armpit hair attaches itself to a man's face.

There are two central characters, a man and a woman, who appear in both scenes,  but they are unnamed. The chronology of the film is disjointed; jumping from "once upon a time" to "eight years later," etc.

==Analysis==

American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called ''Un chien andalou'' "the most famous short film ever made, and anyone halfway interested in the cinema sees it sooner or later, usually several times."[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000416/REVIEWS08/401010369/1023]

Critics have suggested that ''Un chien andalou'' can be understood as a typically Bu<U+00F1>uelian anti-[[bourgeois]], [[anticlerical]] piece. The man dragging a piano, donkey and priests has been interpreted as an allegory of man's progress towards his goal being hindered by the baggage of society's conventions that he is forced to bear. Likewise, the image of an eyeball being sliced by a razor can be understood as Bu<U+00F1>uel "attacking" the film's viewers. Also, [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca]] viewed this film as a personal attack on him. 

In spite of these varying interpretations, Bu<U+00F1>uel makes clear through his writings, that between Dal<U+00ED> and himself, the only rule for the writing of the script was that "no idea or image that might lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind would be accepted." <ref>{{cite book | first=Luis | last=Bu<U+00F1>uel |others=Abigail Israel (trans) | title=My Last Sigh | publisher=Knopf | location=New York | year=1983 | id=ISBN 0-394-52854-9}}</ref>

Some scholars argue that ''Un chien andalou'' might be the genesis of the filmmaking style present in the modern music video.  Others say it is among the first low budget [[independent films]].

==Behind the scenes==
* The eyeball being sliced is in fact a cow's eye which was placed into an open socket of an actress missing her original eye. (Ref. Bu<U+00F1>uel, 1968) (A close inspection of the shot makes it clear that it is in fact a cow's eye in a cow's socket.)

* Modern prints of the film feature a soundtrack: excerpts from "Liebestod", from [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' and two [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[tango]]s. These are the same music that Bu<U+00F1>uel played on a [[phonograph]] during the original 1929 screening; he first added them to a sound print of the film in [[1960]]. (Ref. Bu<U+00F1>uel, 1968)

* Both of the main actors (Batcheff and Mareuil) eventually committed suicide.

==Influence==
* [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s [[1929 in film|1929]] comedy short, ''[[Wrong Again]]'' has a scene with a horse on a piano, a possible reference to ''Un chien andalou'''s donkeys in pianos. 
* The film is heavily referenced in [[the Pixies]]' song "[[Debaser]]".
* During his 1976 tour, rock star [[David Bowie]] used the film as his opening act. 
* [[Esthero]]'s music video for "Heaven Sent" draws heavily from the film's imagery.
* [[The Eraserheads]] song "Andalusian Dog" derives heavily from the imagery of the film.
* The [[1990s]] animated series [[The Critic]] parodies a scene from the film (the nun on the bike) in an episode.
* The 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' featured scenes from ''Un chien andalou''.
* A 2003 South Korean film ''[[Oldboy]]'' features the scene in which ants are coming out of [[vein]] on the hero's arm. The hero later becomes a killer.
* A 2005 [[advertising|advert]] for [[Stella Artois]] was heavily inspired by the film. The advert's most direct reference is a shot of a cracked egg from which ants emerge <U+2014> a more television-friendly version of the hand scene in the original.
* The film ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'' was heavily influenced by ''Un chien andalou''.[http://blogs.suntimes.com/scanners/2006/06/birth_of_a_bunuelian_notion.html]

==Notes==
<references/> The 1991 original [[Silence of the Lambs]]'s cover case and original movie poster featured a graphic picture of a moth with a skull imprinted on its back. This picture was taken from Un Chien Andalou's scene where the woman is startled while noticing a moth on the doorframe of her apartment. As the camera zooms in one can almost see the exact-same moth.
