The '''Aston Martin DB9''' is a [[grand tourer]] launched by [[Aston Martin]] in 2004. Available both as a [[coupe]] and a [[convertible]], the DB9 was the spiritual successor of the DB7. It was the first model built at Aston Martin [[Gaydon]] facility.

Designed with classic DB elements in mind, the DB9 is made of largely aluminium. The chassis is the [[Aston Martin VH platform|VH platform]], also found in the [[Aston Martin DBS]]. The engine, on the other hand, is the [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec V12 6.0 L|6.0L V12]] from the [[Aston Martin V12 Vanquish]]. The most recent Aston Martin has a top speed of {{convert|183|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and a 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} time of 4.1 seconds.

[[Aston Martin Racing]] has adapted the DB9 for [[sports car racing]], producing the [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]] for [[FIA GT1]] and the [[Aston Martin DBRS9|DBRS9]] for [[FIA GT3]]. These two cars are lightened DB9s; the interior features are removed and the aluminium body panels are replaced by [[carbon fibre]] panels. Additionally, engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more [[horsepower]]. The DBR9 has won in several events, including its debut event.

==Development and design==
The DB9 was designed by [[Ian Callum]] and [[Henrik Fisker]], and was first revealed at the 2003 [[Frankfurt Auto Show]].<ref name=autoshow>{{cite news|title=Aston Martin DB9 <U+2013> 2003 Frankfurt Auto Show.|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/aston-martin-db9-auto-shows-1|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=September 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Feast|first=Richard|title=2005 Aston Martin DB9: Under the Beauty, an Up-to-Date Beast|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/automobiles/14AUTO.html?_r=0|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=14 November 2004}}</ref> The moniker "DB" stems from the initials of [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|David Brown]], the owner of Aston Martin for a significant part of its history.<ref name=aw20130204>{{cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Mark|title=DB9 Is Fine|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=4 February 2013|volume=63|issue=3|pages=32<U+2013>33}}</ref> Despite being the spiritual successor of the DB7, Aston Martin did not call the car the DB8 due to fears that the name would suggest that the car was equipped with only a [[V8 engine]]; the DB9 has a [[V12 engine|V12]]).<ref name=forbes>{{cite web|url= http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2008/aston_martin/db9_coupe/review.html|title= 2008 Aston Martin DB9 Reviews |accessdate=5 July 2008|work=Forbes Autos| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080628054119/http://www.forbesautos.com/reviews/2008/aston_martin/db9_coupe/review.html| archivedate= 28 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes|last1=Gorzelany|first1=Jim|last2=de Paula|first2=Matthew}}</ref> It was also reported that Aston Martin believed that naming the car "DB8" would indicate a gradual evolution and misrepresent the car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/Aston-Martin-DB9-Overview-d908 |title= Aston Martin DB9 Overview |accessdate=5 July 2008|work=Car Gurus}}</ref> 

The DB9 is the first model to be built at Aston Martin's [[Gaydon]] facility in [[Warwickshire]], England. In a 2007 interview, Aston Martin CEO Dr. [[Ulrich Bez]] stated that, though Aston Martin was traditionally a maker of more exclusive automobiles, he believed Aston Martin needed to be more visible and build more cars.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.insideline.com/aston-martin/inside-line-qa-aston-martins-dr-ulrich-bez.html |title= Inside Line Q&A: Aston Martin's Dr. Ulrich Bez |first=Alistair|last=Weaver|date=19 March 2007|accessdate=26 October 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100222072320/http://www.insideline.com/aston-martin/inside-line-qa-aston-martins-dr-ulrich-bez.html| archivedate= 22 February 2010|work=Edmunds: Inside Line|deadurl=yes}}</ref> At launch, Aston Martin planned to build between 1,400 and 1,500 DB9s per year.<ref name=carnews>{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Peter|title=Aston Martin DB9 <U+2013> Car News|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/aston-martin-db9-car-news|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=October 2003}}</ref>

===Interior===
[[File:Aston Martin int.jpg|thumb|right|The interior of the Aston Martin DB9]]
The DB9's interior is made of leather with walnut trim. In newer editions, the leather is additionally given hand-stitched accents and joins. On the dashboard, [[satnav]] and [[Bluetooth]] come standard. A [[Dolby]] Prologic sound system can be hooked up to [[satellite radio]], a six-CD changer, an [[iPod]] connector, a USB connector, or an auxiliary input jack. This sound system can be upgraded to a [[Bang & Olufsen]] stereo.

The coupe comes standard with two front seats and rear seats. A seating package, which removes the back seats and replaces the front seats with lighter seats made of [[Kevlar]] and [[carbon fibre]], can be chosen.<ref name=topspeed /> The [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] is {{convert|6.6|cuft|cm3|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in the coupe or {{convert|4.8|cuft|cm3|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in the Volante.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Interior|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Aston-Martin_DB9/Interior/|work=[[U.S. News]]|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref>

===Exterior===
Made to follow Aston's [[Aston Martin DB7|DB7]] model, the DB9 is, according to Aston's initial press release, "a contemporary version of classic DB design elements and characteristics".<ref name=press>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin DB9 in Depth|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10605087132/aston-martin-db9-in-depth|accessdate=28 April 2013|work=World Car Fans}}</ref> It retains the traditional Aston Martin [[grille]] and [[Glossary of automotive design#S|side strakes]], and the design attempts to keep the lines simple and refined. The boot of the car is pronounced, like that of the [[Aston Martin DB4|DB4]] and [[Aston Martin DB5|DB5]]. At the front, DB9 is without a separate [[nose cone]], and has no visible bumpers.<ref name=press /> The exterior skin is largely aluminium, though the front fenders and bonnet are composite.<ref name=firstdrive />

In the revised 2013 model year edition, Aston made small revisions to the bodywork, slightly changing the grille and merging the two sections of the side heat extractors into one. Additionally, Aston Martin added a rear spoiler to the DB9, which is integrated with the boot lid.<ref name=topspeed>{{cite news|last=Cupler|first=Justin|title=2013 Aston Martin DB9 Review|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/aston-martin/2013-aston-martin-db9-ar112285.html|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=TopSpeed|date=19 September 2012}}</ref>

===Engine===
The Aston Martin DB9 was initially launched equipped with a [[Ford Duratec engine#Duratec V12 6.0 L|6.0L V12]] engine, originally taken from its sister car, the [[Aston Martin V12 Vanquish|V12 Vanquish]]. The engine provides {{convert|420|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of [[torque]] at 5,000 [[rpm]] and a maximum power of {{convert|450|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} at 6,000 rpm.<ref name=autoshow /> The DB9 can accelerate from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of {{convert|186|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. The engine largely sits behind the front-axle line to improve weight distribution.<ref name=carnews /> Changes to the engine for the 2013 model year DB9 increased the horsepower to {{convert|510|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and torque to {{convert|457|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. The car's 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} time decreased to 4.1 seconds and the new top speed is {{convert|183|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name=motortrend>{{cite news|last=Jurnecka|first=Rory|title=First Test: 2013 Aston Martin DB9|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupes/1301_2013_aston_martin_db9_first_test/|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=[[Motor Trend]]|date=30 January 2013}}</ref> 

The DB9 can be equipped with either a six-speed conventional manual gearbox from [[Graziano Trasmissioni|Graziano]] or a six-speed [[flappy paddle gearbox|flappy paddle-type automatic gearbox]] from [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]].<ref name=firstdrive>{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Peter|title=Aston Martin DB9 <U+2013> First Drive Review|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/aston-martin-db9-first-drive-review|accessdate=29 April 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=June 2004}}</ref> The automatic gearbox increases the 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} time to 4.9 seconds, though the top speed remains the same. The gearbox is rear-mounted and is driven by a carbon-fiber tail shaft inside a cast aluminium torque tube.<ref name=carnews />

===Chassis===
The DB9 is the first Aston Martin model to be designed and developed on Ford's aluminium [[Aston Martin VH platform|VH (vertical/horizontal) platform]] which also underpins Aston Martin's flagship [[Aston Martin DBS V12|DBS]]. The body structure is composed of aluminium and composites melded together by mechanically fixed self-piercing rivets and robotic assisted adhesive bonding techniques. The bonded aluminium structure is claimed to possess more than double the torsional rigidity of its [[Aston Martin DB7|predecessor's]], despite being 25 percent lighter. Additionally, the steering column, inner door frame, and transmission paddles are made from [[magnesium]], further decreasing the car's weight.<ref name=carnews />

The DB9 also contains [[anti-roll bars]] and [[double wishbone suspension]], supported by [[coil springs]]. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. The car also features three modes for the tuning: ''normal'', for every-day use, ''sport'', for more precise movement at the cost of ride comfort, and ''track'', which furthers the effects of the ''sport'' setting.<ref name=topspeed />

===Wheels===
The DB9 initially launched with {{convert|19|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wheels with a width of {{convert|8.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref name=Coupe07 /> These were later changed to {{convert|20|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheels with widths of {{convert|8.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in the front and {{convert|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in the back.<ref>{{cite web|title=The New DB9 <U+2013> Specifications|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/cars/the-new-db9/db9-specifications|work=Aston Martin|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref> The [[tire|tyre]]s are [[Pirelli]] P-Zero with [[tyre code|codes]] of 245/35ZR20 and 295/30ZR20. The brakes are carbon-ceramic with six-piston [[calipers]] in the front and four-piston calipers in the back.<ref name=autoblog>{{cite news|last=Harley|first=Michael|title=2013 Aston Martin DB9 Review|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/02/06/2013-aston-martin-db9-review-video/|accessdate=5 May 2013|newspaper=[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]|date=6 February 2013}}</ref>

==Variants==
[[File:SC06 2006 Aston Martin DB9 Volante.jpg|thumb|right|An Aston Martin DB9 Volante]]

===DB9 Volante===
The Aston Martin DB9 Volante is the convertible version of the DB9 coupe. The chassis, though stiffer, uses the same base VH platform. To protect occupants from [[rollover]]s, the Volante has strengthened windshield pillars and two pop-up hoops behind the rear seats. The hoops cannot be disabled and will break the car's rear window if deployed. In an effort to improve the Volante's ride while cruising, Aston Martin have softened the springs and lightened the anti-roll bars in the Volante, leading to a gentler suspension. The retractable roof of the Volante is made of folding fabric and takes 17 seconds to be put up or down. The Volante weighs {{convert|130|lb|kg|0|abbr=off|disp=flip}} more than the coupe.<ref name=volante>{{cite news|last=Hutton|first=Ray|title=Aston Martin DB9 Volante <U+2013> First Drive Review|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/aston-martin-db9-volante-first-drive-review|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=September 2005}}</ref> 

The coupe and Volante both share the same semi-automatic and automatic gearboxes and engine. The car is limited to {{convert|165|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} to retain the integrity of the roof. Like the coupe, the original Volante has {{convert|420|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of torque at 5,000 rpm and a maximum power of {{convert|450|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} at 6,000 rpm. The 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} is slowed to 4.9 seconds due to the additional weight.<ref name=volante /> On newer models, like the coupe's, the Volante's horsepower and torque have increased to {{convert|510|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and {{convert|457|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} respectively.<ref name=autoblog />

===DB9 LM===
To commemorate Aston Martin's GT1 victory at the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Aston Martin released the DB9 LM (Le Mans) to be available in the first quarter of 2008. The DB9 LM comes standard with the DB9's optional sports pack and is only available as a semi-automatic coupe. The LM is painted Sarthe Silver, named after the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], where Le Mans is run, and has red [[brake caliper]]s, a chromed mesh grill, and a special black leather interior, with red stitching and the Le Mans track stitched on the central consol. The car is also fitted with the DBS clear rear lights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Tom|title=Two more Astons for Frankfurt show|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/two-more-astons-frankfurt-show|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=[[Autocar]]}}</ref> Only 124 DB9 LMs were made.<ref>{{cite news|last=Siler|first=Steve|title=2008 Aston Martin DB9 LM and V-8 Vantage N400|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2008-aston-martin-db9-lm-and-v-8-vantage-n400-auto-shows|accessdate=30 April 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=September 2007}}</ref>

===DB9 Carbon Black, Morning Frost, and Quantum Silver===
Following the success of several special edition models of other Aston Martin cars, like the [[Aston Martin V12 Vantage|V12 Vantage Carbon Black]] and [[Aston Martin DBS V12#Special editions|DBS Carbon Black]], Aston Martin announced three special edition models of the DB9 in 2011: the DB9 Carbon Black, Morning Frost, and Quantum Silver. All three models are denoted by a [[Sill plate#Automobiles|sill plaque]] bearing their respective names.<ref name=special>{{cite news|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|title=Aston Martin Rounds Out The Year With Three New DB9 Special Editions|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1052811_aston-martin-rounds-out-the-year-with-three-new-db9-special-editions|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=[[Motor Authority]]|date=22 December 2010}}</ref> All three models have the same 6.0L V12 engine  as the base DB9, which produces {{convert|470|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. All three models are available both as a coupe and a Volante.<ref name=quantum>{{cite news|last=Garlitos|first=Kirby|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Quantum Silver|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/aston-martin/2011-aston-martin-db9-quantum-silver-ar102240.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=TopSpeed|date=23 December 2010}}</ref> 

The DB9 Carbon Black, like its name suggests, has a black paint job and interior. This includes a black center console and interior door handles on the inside, and black grills, a black tailpipe, and black {{convert|19|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} 10-[[spoke]] wheels on the outside. The interior also has numerous add-ons to make the car more sporty, including silver stitching for the leather and a polished glass [[gear stick]]. The exhaust has been modified to create a different sound to add to the sporty feel. The Carbon Black is only available as a six-speed semi-automatic.<ref>{{cite news|first=Simona|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Carbon Black|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/aston-martin/2011-aston-martin-db9-carbon-black-ar102231.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=TopSpeed|date=22 December 2010}}</ref>

The DB9 Morning Frost's paint job is likewise like its name suggests: [[Pearlescent coating|pearlescent]] white. However, on the inside, the Morning Frost is fitted with metallic bronze leather and a black center console and interior door handles. On the outside, the Morning Frost has silver {{convert|19|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} 10-spoke wheels, silver brake calipers, and silver grilles. Like the Carbon Black, the DB9 Morning Frost has a six-speed semi-automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite news|first=Simona|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Morning Frost|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/aston-martin/2011-aston-martin-db9-morning-frost-ar102235.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=TopSpeed|date=22 December 2010}}</ref>

The DB9 Quantum Silver uses a silver paint job also found on the [[Aston Martin DBS]] in [[Quantum of Solace]], hence its name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aston Martin Celebrates 2010 - 'The Year of the Specials'|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/news-viewer/2010/12/22/aston-martin-celebrates-2010-the-year-of-the-specials-|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=[[Aston Martin]]|date=22 December 2010}}</ref> Inside, the Quantum Silver shares the black center console and leather. On the outside, it also has black grills and {{convert|19|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} wheels.<ref name=quantum /> The Quantum Silver has the same semi-automatic transmission as its counterparts, and shares a modified sports exhaust with the Carbon Black.<ref name=special />

==Motorsport==
[[File:DBR9 Donut 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The DBR9 which won its class at the [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|2007]] and [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans]].]]
===DBR9===
{{main|Aston Martin DBR9}}
The DB9 has been adapted for use in [[sports car racing]] by [[Aston Martin Racing]], a collaboration between Aston Martin and [[Prodrive]]. Called the [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]], the car debuted in 2005. It retains the DB9's 6.0 V12 engine basic parts, but the car has been extensively modified to decrease its weight as well as to improve performance. Most of the car's aluminium body panels have been converted into [[carbon fibre]] panels, and several external features, like a [[Diffuser (automotive)|front splitter]] and a [[rear wing]], have been added to increase the car's [[downforce]]. Inside, the DB9's interior has mostly been scrapped to save weight. Likewise, though the suspension's layout remains the same, it has been improved to racing specifications. The brakes are upgraded to [[Brembo]] [[carbon-carbon]] disks and six-piston calipers. The transmission in the DBR9 is a [[Xtrac]] six-speed sequential [[manual transmission|manual]], containing a [[Salisbury]] friction-plate [[limited-slip differential]], and the prop shaft is also made of carbon fibre. The engine modifications allow the car to develop {{convert|625|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} and {{convert|550|lbfft|Nm|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} of torque; that power, in addition to the lost weight, allows the DBR9 can go from 0 to {{convert|100|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in 6.4 seconds.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gillies|first=Mark|title=Aston Martin DBR9 <U+2013> Sport|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/aston-martin-dbr9|accessdate=4 May 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=February 2007}}</ref> 

The DBR9 won in its debut at the [[2005 12 Hours of Sebring]], and has gone on to take wins in the [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Le Mans Series]], [[FIA GT Championship]], as well as the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin announces driver line-up for 12 Hours of Sebring|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/news-viewer/2010/03/17/aston-martin-announces-driver-line-up-for-12-hours-of-sebring-|work=Aston Martin|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=12 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin at the American Le Mans|url=http://www.alms.com/manufacturers/aston-martin|work=American Le Mans Series|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First FIA GT Championship win for DBR9|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/news-viewer/2005/12/05/first-fia-gt-championship-win-for-dbr9|work=Aston Martin|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=5 December 2005}}</ref>

===DBRS9===
{{main|Aston Martin DBRS9}}
Aston Martin Racing also developed a different car following [[FIA GT3 European Championship|FIA GT3]] regulations. Called the DBRS9, the car shares carbon fibre bodywork and the chassis and suspension layout of the DBR9.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston martin Racing DBRS9 completes first 3000 kms of testing|url=http://www.astonmartin.com/news-viewer/2012/05/04/aston-martin-racing-dbrs9-completes-first-3000-kms-of-testing|work=Aston Martin|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=18 November 2005}}</ref> While the engine has also remained the same, it has been tuned to develop {{convert|520|hp|PS|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}. The DBRS9 can be equipped with either a six-speed [[H-pattern]] gearbox or a six-speed sequential box and has a 0 to {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of {{convert|195|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aston Martin DBRS9 Race Car|url=http://www.chicagoautoshow.com/mobile/vehicles_on_display/detail.aspx?VehicleId=1137|work=[[Chicago Auto Show]]|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>

==Reception==
Car critics have generally rated the DB9 coupe and Volante well, praising the car's luxurious interior and exterior design. On the British automotive show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', the DB9 is thought of highly. Notably, on the show's "[[The Cool Wall|Cool Wall]]" segment, the presenters called the DB9 "too cool" for the wall and gave it its own category, dubbed the "DB9 Sub Zero Fridge", a mini-refrigerator containing the car's card.<ref>{{cite episode|series=Top Gear|serieslink=Top Gear (2002 TV series)||credits=[[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Richard Hammond]]|network=BBC|date=9 May 2004|began=2002|seriesno=4|number=1}}</ref> While reviewing the Volante, [[Richard Hammond]] called the interior of the DB9 "one of the best known to man". He felt that the car was less stiff than the coupe, however, to the point that the car was "wobbly".<ref>{{cite episode|series=Top Gear|serieslink=Top Gear (2002 TV series)||credits=[[Richard Hammond]]|network=BBC|date=12 June 2005|began=2002|seriesno=6|number=3}}</ref>

Both [[Edmunds.com]] and [[Road and Track]] critiqued the DB9 for not having as good handling as other sports cars, noting that the car isn't stiff enough. However, Edmunds noted that while the [[Mercedes-Benz R129|Mercedes-Benz SL600 and SL55 AMG]] were objectively better cars, the DB9 was more desirable.<ref>{{cite web|title=2008 Aston Martin DB9 Review|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Aston-Martin_DB9/2008/|work=[[US News]]|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref> When compared directly against other cars, like the [[Porsche 996|Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet]] and the [[Ford GT]], the DB9 was ranked poorly, though the reviewer noted that comparing it against faster cars "highlighted its shortcomings".<ref>{{cite news|last=Winfield|first=Barry|title=Aston Martin DB9 vs. Ferrari F430, Ford GT, Lamborghini Gallardo, M-B SL65 AMG, Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/aston-martin-db9-vs-ferrari-f430-ford-gt-lamborghini-gallardo-m-b-sl65-amg-porsche-911-turbo-s-cabriolet-comparison-tests|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=August 2005}}</ref> Likewise, when compared to the [[Bentley Continental GT]], [[Mercedes-Benz C215|Mercedes-Benz CL600]], and [[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti|Ferrari 612 Scaglietti F1]], the DB9 ranked poorly again, though reviewers said that "despite its problems, the DB9 would be their personal choice".<ref>{{cite news|first1=Ray|last1=Hutton|first2=Tony|last2=Quiroga|first3=Peter|last3=Robinson|first4=Larry|last4=Webster|title=2005 Aston Martin DB9 vs. Bentley Continental GT, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti F1, M-B CL600|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2005-aston-martin-db9-vs-bentley-continental-gt-ferrari-612-scaglietti-f1-m-b-cl600-comparison-tests|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Car and Driver|date=August 2004}}</ref> The issues with stiffness were largely fixed by later iterations of the DB9, however, as noted by [[Autoweek]] and Edmunds.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rendell|first=Julian|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Volante, an AW Flash Drive|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100902/CARREVIEWS/100909980|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Autoweek|date=2 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Aston Martin DB9|url=http://www.edmunds.com/aston-martin/db9/2012/|work=Edmunds|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

The DB9's interior has been called "regal"<ref name=autoblog /> and "dazzling",<ref>{{cite news|last=Mead|first=Sue|title=2005 Aston Martin DB9|url=http://www.autobytel.com/aston-martin/db9/2005/reviews/2005-aston-martin-db9-10/|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Autobytel|date=10 August 2004}}</ref> with Edmunds saying, "[w]ords like 'rich' and 'crafted' just don't cut it, though 'decadent' and 'sculpted by the Almighty himself' get close".<ref>{{cite news|last=Brauer|first=Karl|title=2005 Aston Martin DB9 First Drive|url=http://www.edmunds.com/aston-martin/db9/2005/road-test.html|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=Edmunds|date=18 March 2005}}</ref> Critics liked the comfort of the almost racecar-like driver's seat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Frankl|first=Nicholas|title=Review: Aston DB9 <U+2013> Million Dollar DB|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2005/03/09/007833.html|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=[[The Auto Channel]]|date=9 March 2005}}</ref> Reviewers complained about the back seats however, with Forbes saying "think of it more as a padded parcel shelf".<ref name=forbes /> Likewise, reviewers complained that the space for cargo was limited, though many quipped the small back seats could help hold luggage.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Aston Martin DB9 Interior|url=http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/Aston-Martin_DB9/Interior/|work=US News|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

Another common complaint was car's poor satnav system, which [[Automobile Magazine]] called the car's "Achilles heel", noting that "selecting a route is painful at best".<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: 2009 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/0904_2009_aston_martin_db9_coupe/|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=[[Automobile Magazine]]|date=April 2009}}</ref> Newer models still contain old satnavs that are outdated and difficult to figure out.<ref name=motortrend />
