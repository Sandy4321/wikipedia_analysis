A '''cruiser''' is a [[motorcycle]] in the style of American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, including those made by [[Harley-Davidson]], [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]], [[Henderson Motorcycle|Excelsior]] and [[Henderson Motorcycle|Henderson]]. The [[Motorcycle#Motorcycle rider postures|riding position]] usually places the feet forward and the hands up, with the spine erect or leaning back slightly. Typical cruiser engines emphasize easy rideability and [[Gear shift|shifting]], with plenty of low-end [[torque]] but not necessarily large amounts of outright [[horsepower]], traditionally [[V-twin engine|V-twins]] but [[engine configuration]] are common today. Cruisers that have greater performance than the norm, including more horsepower, stronger brakes and better suspension are often called power cruisers.

Japanese companies began producing models evocative of the early cruisers in the mid-1980s, and by 1997 the market had grown to nearly 60 percent of the US market,<ref>{{cite news|last=McCraw|first=Jim|title=Motorcycle Wars: Japan's Latest Shots at Fortress Harley|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/automobiles/motorcycle-wars-japan-s-latest-shots-at-fortress-harley.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 July 1997|quote=Mr. Brown says cruisers are driving much of the industry's growth, accounting for more than 58 percent of street-bike sales. He estimates that Harley will take 52.5 percent of the cruiser market this year, down from 55 percent in 1991, and the four Japanese companies will combine for 47.3 percent, with Honda at 16.4 percent, Suzuki at 11.5, Kawasaki at 10.7 and Yamaha at 8.7.}}</ref> such that a number of motorcycle manufacturers including [[BMW Motorrad|BMW]], [[Honda]], [[Moto Guzzi California|Moto Guzzi]], [[Yamaha]], [[Suzuki]], [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph]] and [[Victory Motorcycles|Victory]] have currently or have had important models evocative of the American cruiser.

Harley-Davidsons and other cruisers with extensive luggage for touring have been called, sometimes disparagingly or jocularly, baggers, or full baggers, as well as dressers, full dressers, or full dress tourers. Now these terms can refer to any [[touring motorcycle]], not only cruisers.<ref name=Stermer2006>{{Citation|last=Stermer |year=2006 |first=Bill |title=Streetbikes: Everything You Need to Know |publisher=Motorbooks Workshop/MBI |location= [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] |isbn=0-7603-2362-3 |pages= 8&ndash;17 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title= Custom Motorcycles: Choppers, Bobbers, Baggers |first= Howard |last= Kelly |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=lk5FJlRFOA8C&pg=PA161 |page=161 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=kEX7Ncd3hO4C&pg=PA232 |page=232 |title=The Savvy Guide to Motorcycles|first=Shirley |last=Duglin Kennedy |publisher=Indy Tech Publishing |year=2005|isbn= 978-0-7906-1316-1 }}</ref><ref name=Joans2001>{{Citation |title=Bike lust: Harleys, women, and American society|first=Barbara|last=Joans|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2001| isbn=9780299173548 |page=259 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=0VEvUavtKMcC&pg=PA259}}</ref>

Cruisers are often the basis for [[custom motorcycle]] projects that result in a bike modified to suit the owner's ideals, and as such are a source of pride and accomplishment.

Many power cruisers and Japanese cruisers of the 1980s have more neutral riding positions. While typical cruisers have limited performance and turning ability due to a low-slung design, power cruisers or similar performance-oriented cruisers can be leaned farther for better cornering. Otherwise, customization can increase the bike's lean angle to enable cornering at higher speeds.<ref>Stuart, Ben.
