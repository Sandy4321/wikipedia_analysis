'''Catherine Winkworth''' ([[September 13]], [[1827]] - [[July 1]], [[1878]]) was an [[English language|English]] translator best known for bringing the [[German language|German]] [[chorale]] tradition to many English speakers with her translations of many [[hymns]].

Born in [[Hol<U+00AD>born, Lon<U+00AD>don, Eng<U+00AD>land]], Winkworth lived most of her life in [[Manchester, England|Manchester]].  She spent a year in [[Dres<U+00AD>den]], however, during which time she took an interest in German hymnody. Around [[1854]], she pub<U+00AD>lished her book ''[[Lyra Ger<U+00AD>man<U+00AD>i<U+00AD>ca]]'', a collection of German hymns which she had chosen and translated into English. A further collection followed in [[1858]]; in [[1863]], she published ''[[The Chor<U+00AD>ale Book for England]]'', and in [[1869]], she followed this with ''[[Christ<U+00AD>ian Sing<U+00AD>ers of Ger<U+00AD>many]]''.  Winkworth died near [[Ge<U+00AD>ne<U+00AD>va]], and was buried in [[Mon<U+00AD>ne<U+00AD>tier, Sa<U+00AD>voy, Switz<U+00AD>er<U+00AD>land|Monnetier]], in [[Savoy]].
