In addition to the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the film won the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It was also awarded seven French [[C<U+00E9>sar Awards|C<U+00E9>sars]] including [[C<U+00E9>sar Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[C<U+00E9>sar Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for [[Adrien Brody|Brody]] (who became the only [[United States|American]] [[actor]] to win one).

==Plot==
[[Wladyslaw Szpilman]], a famous [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] pianist working for [[Warsaw]] Radio, sees his whole world collapse with the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] on September 1, 1939. After the radio station is rocked by explosions from German bombing, Szpilman goes home and learns that [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[France]] have declared war on [[Nazi Germany]]. He and his family rejoice, believing the war will end quickly.

When the Nazis' armed [[SS]] organization occupies Warsaw after the regular army passes on, living conditions for the Jewish population gradually deteriorate as their rights are slowly eroded: first they are allowed only a limited amount of money per family, then they must wear armbands imprinted with the  blue [[Star of David]] to identify themselves, and eventually, late in 1940, they are all forced into the squalid [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. There, they face hunger, persecution and humiliation from the [[SS]] and the ever present fear of death or torture. The Nazis became increasingly sadistic and the family experiences and/or witnesses many horrors inflicted on their neighbours.   

Before long, the family, along with thousands of others, are rounded up for deportation by train to the [[Extermination camp|extermination facility]] at [[Treblinka]]. Szpilman sees his brother reading from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice|Merchant of Venice]]''. He asks him to read aloud, and he reads: "If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? If you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" Szpilman remarks that it is an appropriate play for their situation. His brother responds, "That's why I brought it." As the Jews are being forced onto cattle cars, Szpilman is saved at the last moment by one of the [[Jewish Ghetto Police]], who happens to be a family friend. 

Separated from his family and loved ones, Szpilman manages to survive.  At first he is pressed into a German reconstruction unit inside the ghetto as a [[slave labour]]er. During this period another Jewish labourer confides to Szpilman two critical pieces of information: one, that many Jews who still survive know of the German plans to [[Holocaust|exterminate]] them, and two, that a Jewish [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|uprising]] against the Germans is being actively prepared for. Szpilman volunteers his help for the plan. He is enlisted to help smuggle weapons into the ghetto, almost being caught at one point. Later, before the uprising starts, Szpilman decides to go into hiding outside the ghetto, relying on the help of non-Jews who still remember him.

While living in hiding, he witnesses many horrors committed by the [[SS]], such as widespread killing, beating and burning of Jews and others (the burning is mostly shown during the two Warsaw uprisings). In 1943 Szpilman also finally witnesses the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] he helped to bring about, and its aftermath as the SS forcibly enters the [[Warsaw Ghetto|ghetto]] and kills nearly all the remaining insurgents. 

Among the staff of the [[SS]] ghetto outpost, a figure (revealed as [[Josef Bl<U+00F6>sche]] after the war) specialized in finding remaining hidden Jews; he executed about 2,000 for no reason and with no mercy, including pregnant women and infants. Two scenes resemble Bl<U+00F6>sche's typical actions as witnessed by victims or his former SS comrades:<ref>German TV Documentary (2003) "Der SS-Mann Josef Bl<U+00F6>sche - Leben und Sterben eines M<U+00F6>rders" (The SS figure Josef Bl<U+00F6>sche - A Murderer's Life and Death), based on court case archives etc., see also http://www.wdr.de/tv/dokumentation/ss-mann.html</ref> in one scene, Bl<U+00F6>sche cold-heartedly selects and then executes a number of captured Jews who he deems not young or fit enough for construction labour. In the other scene, his response to a young mother's inquiry about the deportation destination is to shoot her in the forehead.  

A year goes by and life in Warsaw further deteriorates. Szpilman is forced to flee his first hiding place, after a neighbour detects his presence and threatens to inform on him. In his second hiding place, near a German [[military hospital]], Szpilman nearly dies due to [[jaundice]] and [[malnutrition]]. In August 1944, the [[Armia Krajowa|Polish resistance]] mounts the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against the [[German occupation]]. Warsaw is virtually [[Aftereffects of the Warsaw Uprising|razed and depopulated]] as a result. After the surviving Warsaw population is deported from the city ruins and the escape of German [[SS]] from the approaching [[Soviet Army]], Szpilman is left entirely alone.

In buildings still standing, he searches desperately for food. While trying to open a can of [[Pickled_cucumber#Polish|Polish pickles]], Szpilman realizes to his horror that he is being watched from behind. But then he realizes that he has not been discovered by a SS ghetto patrol, but by a [[captain]] of the [[Wehrmacht|regular German Army]], [[Wilm Hosenfeld]]. Upon questioning Szpilman and discovering that he is a pianist, Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play something for him on the [[grand piano]] that happens to be in the building. The decrepit Szpilman, only a shadow of the flamboyant pianist he once was, plays an abbreviated version of [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Ballade No.1 in G minor|Ballade in G minor]]. The contrast of such beauty with such devastated surroundings is striking. Hosenfeld lets Szpilman continue hiding in the attic of the building. He even brings Szpilman food regularly, thus saving his life.

Another few weeks go by, and the German troops are forced to withdraw from Warsaw due to the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|advance of the Red Army]] troops. Before leaving the area, Hosenfeld asks Szpilman what his name is, and, upon hearing it, remarks that it is apt for a pianist (Szpilman is a homonym for the German ''Spielmann'', meaning "man who plays"). Hosenfeld also promises to listen for Szpilman on Polish Radio. He gives Szpilman his [[Wehrmacht]] uniform [[greatcoat]] and leaves. Later, that coat nearly proves fatal for Szpilman when [[Polish First Army|Polish troops]], liberating ruins of Warsaw, mistake him for a German officer and shoot at him. He is eventually able to convince them that he is Polish, and they stop shooting. When harshly asked, "Why the fucking coat?" the haggard Szpilman simply replies, "I'm cold."

As newly-freed prisoners of a [[concentration camp]] walk home, they pass a fenced-in enclosure of German [[prisoners of war]], guarded by Soviet soldiers. A German prisoner, who turns out to be Hosenfeld, calls out to the passing ex-prisoners. Hosenfeld begs one of them, a violinist of Szpilman's acquaintance, to contact Szpilman to free him. Szpilman, who has gone back to playing live on Warsaw Radio, arrives at the site too late; all the prisoners have been removed along with any trace of the stockade. In the film's final scene, Szpilman triumphantly performs Chopin's ''[[Andante spianato et Grande Polonaise brillante (Chopin)|Grand Polonaise brillante]]'' in E flat major to a large audience in Warsaw. [[Title cards]] shown just before the end credits reveal that Szpilman continued to live in Warsaw and died in 2000, but that Hosenfeld died in 1952 in a Soviet [[prisoner-of-war camp]].

== Production ==
The story had deep connections with director Roman Polanski because he escaped from the [[Cracow Ghetto]] as a child after the death of his mother. He ended up living in a Polish farmer's barn until the war's end. His father almost died in the camps, but they reunited after the [[end of World War II]].

[[Joseph Fiennes]] was Polanski's first choice for the main role, but he turned it down due to a previous commitment to the theatre. Over 1,400 actors auditioned for the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman at a casting call in London. Unsatisfied with all who tried, director Roman Polanski sought to cast Adrien Brody, who he saw as ideal for the role during their first meeting in Paris.

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ThePianist1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Brody with Polanski on the set in Warsaw, Poland.]] -->Principal photography on ''The Pianist'' began on 9 February 2001 in [[Babelsberg Studios]] in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]]. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the [[backlot]] of [[Babelsberg Studios]] as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway.

The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the filmmakers moved to a villa in [[Potsdam]], which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet army hospital in [[Beelitz]], Germany. The scenes that featured the Germans destroying the hospital with flame throwers were filmed here. On 15 March filming finally moved to [[Babelsberg Studios]]. The first scene shot at the studio was the scene Szpilman witnesses a resistance mounted by the Jews from the Ghetto, which is eventually ended by the Nazis. The scene was complex and technically demanding as it involved various stunts and [[explosives]]. Filming at the studios ended on 26 March and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of [[Praga]] was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built on to these original buildings, re-creating World War II&ndash;era Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The [[Umschlagplatz]] scene where Szpilman, his family and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the concentration camps was filmed at the [[National Defence University in Warsaw]].

Principal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production, which took place in Paris, France, where Polanski was born and now resides.

==DVD==

The film was released on DVD on May 26, 2003 in a double-sided "flipper" disc Special Edition DVD. The first side of the disk had the film with no bonus material. The second side of the disc included the Bonus Material. Some Bonus Material included ''The Making of The Pianist'', ''Behind the Scenes interviews with Oscar Winners Adrien Brody, Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood'' and ''Clips from Wladyslaw Szpilman playing the piano'' and much more.

==Music==
:''For more details on the soundtrack, see [[The Pianist (soundtrack)]].
*The piano piece heard at the beginning of the film is [[Chopin]]'s [[Nocturne Op. Posth. in C-sharp minor (Chopin)|Nocturne Op. Posth. in C-sharp minor ''(Lento con gran espressione)'']].
* The piano music heard in the abandoned house when Szpilman had just discovered a hiding place in the attic was the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Moonlight Sonata]]'' by [[Beethoven]]. It would later be revealed that German officer Hosenfeld was the pianist. The German composition juxtaposed with the mainly Polish/Chopin selection of Szpilman.  
*The piano piece played when Szpilman is confronted by Hosenfeld is Chopin's ''[[Ballade No. 1 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 1 in G minor]]'', Op. 23. Also, the version played in the movie was shortened. The entire piece lasts 9-10 minutes.
*The cello piece heard at the middle of the film, played by Dorota, is the Prelude from [[Bach]]'s ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]]''. 
*The piano piece heard at the end of the film, played with an orchestra, is Chopin's ''[[Andante spianato et Grande Polonaise brillante (Chopin)|Grande Polonaise brillante]]'', Op. 22.-Allegro Molto.
*Shots of Szpilman's hands playing the piano in close-up were provided by Polish classical pianist [[Janusz Olejniczak]] (b. 1952), who also performed on the soundtrack.
*Since Polanski wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, Brody spent months reworking his piano technique, and any scene showing Brody playing was actually him playing. Anything else was provided by [[Janusz Olejniczak]].
