The '''SD-100''' and '''SD-160''' are [[light rail|light-rail]] vehicles manufactured by [[Siemens AG|Siemens]]. The SD-100 uses motors that run on direct-current electricity while the SD-160 model features newer motors that run using alternating current. Both models are suited for loading at street level and high-platform level. The two models of car are in use in [[San Diego]] (SD-100), [[Salt Lake City]] (both models), [[Denver]] (both models) and [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]] (SD-160); [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] has also recently placed an order for SD-160s [http://www.edmontonslrt.com/PDFs/2005-10-17-LRV_NewsRelease.pdf].

==Technical details==
The SD-160's dimensions are 24.802 [[metre|m]] by 2.654 m by 3.811 m and can be used in trains of up to six cars. It is powered by four [[alternating current|AC]] motors which provide a maximum of 580 [[kilowatt|kW]] and a maximum speed of 80 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]. It accelerates at 1.25 m/s<sup>2</sup> and decelerates at 1.34 m/s<sup>2</sup> with faster emergency braking. It has a passenger capacity of 236 passengers (standing) with 64 seats.
