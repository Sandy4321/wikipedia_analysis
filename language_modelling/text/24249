== Band history ==
=== ''Early Years'' ===
While the exact date of the formation of P.O.D. is unknown, friends [[Marcos Curiel]] and [[Noah Bernardo|Wuv Bernardo]] engaged in [[jam session]]s in a band called Eschatos, without a vocalist sometime in the early 1990s. After his mother's fatal illness, [[Sonny Sandoval]] converted to [[Christianity]] and was asked by his cousin, Wuv Bernardo, to join P.O.D. as a way to keep his mind straight as stated on their [[DVD]], ''[[Still Payin' Dues]]''. [[Traa Daniels]] joined the band in 1994 when they needed a [[bassist]] for a concert, to replace Gabe Portillo, who appeared in the original [[P.O.D. (demo tape)|demo tape]]. P.O.D. signed with a relatively unknown Christian label, Rescue Records, and released three albums under the label between 1994 and 1997, ''[[Snuff the Punk]]'', ''[[Brown (album)|Brown]]'' and ''[[Payable on Death Live]]''.<ref name= "P.O.D. Biography" /> 

Shortly after the release of ''Payable on Death Live'', [[Essential Records (Christian)|Essential Records]] offered P.O.D. a $100,000 recording contract, but Sonny Sandoval spoke for them all when he politely but firmly told band manager Tim Cook to decline the offer because, <U+201C>God has a bigger plan for P.O.D.<U+201D><ref name="Promotion Crew: P.O.D. Biography">{{cite web |url= http://promotionscrew.com/pod/ecard/ |title=Promotion Crew: P.O.D.

Biography" /> P.O.D. soon released ''[[The Warriors EP]]'', a tribute [[Extended play|EP]] to their loyal fans and a transitional album from Rescue Records to [[Atlantic Records]].

=== ''Mainstream success'' ===
P.O.D.'s third studio album, [[1999 in music|1999]]'s ''[[The Fundamental Elements of Southtown]]'', spawned the hits "Southtown" and ''[[Total Request Live]]'' favorite "Rock the Party (Off the Hook)", which became their first video to reach #1.<ref name="Rock the Party hits #1">{{cite web |url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/?s=recap&y=2000&m=07 |title=Rock the Party hits #1 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |author=Absolute TRL staff |date= |work= ATRL.net |quote= }}</ref> At a time after the [[1999 in music|1999]] album, "School of Hard Knocks" was featured on the soundtrack for ''[[Little Nicky (film)|Little Nicky]]''. All three [[music video]]s endured heavy play on [[MTV2]] and the songs were rock radio hits. The album went on to become [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] platinum.<ref name= "P.O.D. Biography" />

In 2001, on the same day as the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], P.O.D. released their fourth studio album, ''[[Satellite (album)|Satellite]]''. The album's first single, "Alive", went on to become one of [[MTV]]'s and [[MTV2]]'s #1 played video of the year. The video's popularity, as well as the song's positive messages to be grateful for life, helped the song become a huge [[Pop music|pop]] radio hit.

The album's second single, "[[Youth of the Nation]]", was influenced in part by the school shootings at [[Santana High School]], [[Columbine High School]] and [[Granite Hills High School (El Cajon, California)|Granite Hills High School]]. The 2002 singles, "Boom" and "Satellite", also became very popular. Also, the concluding track of the album, "Portrait" received a number of awards including a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 2002. The album went on to become RIAA-certified triple platinum.<ref name="Satellite is certified triple-platinum" />

In the early 2000s P.O.D. played three times at [[Ozzfest]], the heavy metal extravaganza that has now performed before 3.5 million fans across the U.S., with the band featured on the Ozzfest Main Stage in 2002. Some Christian music fans derided the band for bringing its Christian message to a venue also featuring some bands who seemed to support (at least on an aesthetic level) the forces of darkness; others argued that was precisely the point.

=== ''Marcos leaves the band; Payable on Death'' ===
In [[February 19]], [[2003 in music|2003]], guitarist Marcos Curiel left the band due to his side project, [[The Accident Experiment]] and "spiritual differences." However, Marcos claimed that he was actually kicked out of the band.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470028/20030219/pod.jhtml | title= Marcos leaves the group |accessdate= 2007-12-04 | author= Moss, Corey | work=[[Music Television]]| date=2003-02-19}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1819256 | title= Guitarist Marcos exits P.O.D.| accessdate= 2007-12-31 | author=Cohen, Jonathan| date=2003-02-19| work=[[Billboard]]}}</ref> Sonny, Wuv and Traa were devastated about Curiel leaving, they considered breaking up the band, but decided to stay together and recruit another guitarist.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/p/pod/news_feature_031124/ | title= There's No Crying In Rock |accessdate=2008-01-04 | author= Wiederhorn, Jon | work=[[Music Television]]| date= | quote= Sandoval, drummer Wuv and bassist Traa were devastated and considered breaking up the band.

Jason debuted on P.O.D. performing "Sleeping Awake", from [[The Matrix Reloaded]] soundtrack. In the same year they released their fifth studio album, ''[[Payable on Death]]'' which featured the singles, "[[Will You (song)|Will You]]" and "Change the World". The album went on to sell over 520,000 copies and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]].<ref name="P.O.D. parts way with Atlantic Records" />

Sometime after the tsunami in Asia, many singers, musicians, and actors/actresses recorded a song called "Forever in Our Hearts". It is only obtainable on iTunes, and features many well known artists including Sonny and Wuv from P.O.D. All proceeds from this song go to help with the tsunami relief.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000777469 | title= 'Forever' Unites Artists For Tsunami Relief|accessdate=2008-01-02|author=Jeckell, Barry A.|date=2005-02-26|quote=Recording artists from R&B crooner Brian McKnight to screamer Sonny Sandoval of rock act P.O.D. have lent their talents to a single that will raise funds for the tsunami relief effort in Eastern Africa and Southern Asia. | work= [[Billboard]] }}</ref>

On [[November 15]], [[2005 in music|2005]], P.O.D. released ''[[The Warriors EP, Volume 2]]'' as a tribute to their fans. It features some demos from their sixth studio album ''Testify'', as well as two live tracks, two [[A-side and B-side|b-side]]s, and a [[cover version]] of the [[1980s]] [[Payola$]] reggae hit, "Eyes of a Stranger". It was produced by Travis Wyrick.

=== ''Testify'' ===
''[[Testify (P.O.D. album)|Testify]]'' was slated for a December 2005 release, but was pushed back to [[January 24]], [[2006 in music|2006]]. The first single released from the ninth album was "[[Goodbye for Now (P.O.D. song)|Goodbye for Now]]", with another new song called "[[Lights Out (P.O.D. song)|Lights Out]]" being featured as the "official theme song" to [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE)'s ''[[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]]'' event in November 2005. The single "Goodbye For Now" went on to become a #1 video on MTV's TRL along with having a solid radio presence. This was the band's unprecedented 4th number one video on Total Request Live.

In another contribution to WWE, the band's single, "Boom", was used as the opening theme for WWE's return show of ''[[WWE Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' and at ''[[WrestleMania 22]]'' they performed fellow San Diego native [[Oscar Gutierrez|Rey Mysterio]]'s theme song "Booyaka 619".  Mysterio debuted the studio recording of this song as his entrance theme on the May 5 edition of ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]''.
