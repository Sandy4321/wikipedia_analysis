'''Miles-Humes House''', also known as the Potter Home, is a historic home located at [[Bellefonte, Pennsylvania|Bellefonte]], [[Centre County, Pennsylvania]].

== History ==
The Miles-Humes house was originally built circa 1814-1816<ref name="PIHP">National Registry of Historic Places. Application for inclusion: Miles-Humes house. 1976.</ref> for Captain Joseph Miles, the co-founder of both [[Milesburg, Pennsylvania]] and the Centre Furnace Iron Works.  He sold the house in 1830 to [[William Wilson Potter]] and his wife, Lucy, who continued to reside in the house after William's death in 1839. She lived in the house alone until she convinced her niece, Lucy Alexander, and nephew-in-law, Edward Humes, to move in with her.<ref name="montgomery">Montgomery, Dot. "Library will be a Stop on May 19 Homes Tour." ''Pennsylvania Mirror'' May 15, 1976.</ref>

After Edward Humes' death in 1895, his children William Potter Humes and Ann Elmira Humes took up ownership of the house and decided to renovate it.<ref name="kerstetter">Kerstetter, Rich. "Miles-Humes Building received a Big Lift." ''Centre Daily Times'' February 14, 2003.</ref> The Humes siblings remodeled the house extensively, including moving the entire house several feet from the street. The house stayed in the Humes family until Ann's death in 1934, when she donated the house for use as a public library.<ref name="dorothy">Montgomery, Dorothy. "Library 'house'--160 years old." ''Pennsylvania Mirror'' March 28, 1975.</ref> The house officially opened as the [[Centre County Library]] in 1939.
