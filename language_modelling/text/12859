'''Andrea Palladio''' (30 November 1508 <U+2013> 19 August 1580) was an architect active in the [[Republic of Venice]]. Palladio, influenced by [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Greek architecture]], primarily by [[Vitruvius]], is widely considered the most influential individual in the [[Architectural history|history of Western architecture]]. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, [[The Four Books of Architecture]], gained him wide recognition.<ref>[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladio.html His conception of classical architecture was heavily influenced by Vitruvian ideas and his mentor Trissino. "Andrea Palladio."]</ref> The city of [[Vicenza]] and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Biography==
He was born on November 30, 1508 in [[Padua]] under the name of Andrea Di Pietro della Gondola and lived until August 19, 1580.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography|page=1167|year=2003|location=Boston|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn=061825210X|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QfesntdNnbwC&lpg=PA1167&pg=PA1167#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> His father Pietro called "della Gondola" was a miller. From early on, Andrea Palladio was introduced into the work of building. In Padua he gained his first experiences as a stonecutter in the sculpture workshop of Bartolomeo Cavazza da Sossano, who is said to have imposed particularly hard working conditions. At the age of 16 he moved to Vicenza where he would reside for most of his life. In fact, in April 1524, after one failed attempt, Palladio managed to run away to [[Vicenza]]. Here he became an assistant in the Pedemuro studio, a leading workshop of stonecutters and masons. He joined a guild of stonemasons and bricklayers. He was employed as a stonemason to make monuments and decorative sculptures. These sculptures reflected the Mannerist style of the architect Michele Sanmichelli. 

Perhaps the key moment that sparked Palladio's career was being employed by the Humanist poet and scholar, [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], from 1539 to 1538. While Trissino was reconstructing the Villa Cricoli, he took interest in Palladio's work. Trissino was heavily influenced by the studies of Vitruvius, who later influenced Palladio's own ideals and attitudes towards classical architecture. As the leading intellectual in Vicenza, Trissino stimulated the young man to appreciate the arts, sciences and Classical literature and granted him the opportunity to study Ancient architecture in Rome.<ref> He visited Rome alongside Trissino in 1541, 1547, and 1554 until 1556. His earlier visits to Rome influenced his designs of palaces. He modeled his designs based on his interpretation of classical architecture he had witnessed. Curl, James Stevens, "A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture" , [[Oxford University Press]]</ref> It was also Trissino who gave him the name by which he is now known, Palladio, an allusion to the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of wisdom [[Athena|Pallas Athene]] and to a character of a play by Trissino himself. Indeed the word Palladio means ''Wise one''.<ref>"How I Spent A Few Days in Palladio's World" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 3 March 2009, [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123603460173214171.html?mod=article-outset-box WSJ.com]</ref> After Trissino's death in 1550 Palladio benefited from the patronage of the Barbaro brothers, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Daniele Barbaro]], who encouraged his studies of [[classical architecture]] and brought him to Rome in 1554, and the younger brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]]. The powerful Barbaros introduced Palladio to [[Venice]], where he finally became "Proto della Serenissima" (chief architect of the Republic of Venice) after [[Jacopo Sansovino]].  In addition to the Barbaros, the Corner, [[Foscari]], and [[Pisani]] families supported Palladio's career.<ref>''Venice and the Renaissance", Manfredo Tafuri, trans. Jessica Levine, 1989, [[MIT Press]], p.127 [http://books.google.com/books?id=7BYaBnsP5PMC Books.Google.com] ISBN 0262700549</ref>

Andrea Palladio began to develop his own architectural style around 1541. The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]], named after him, adhered to classical [[Roman architecture|Roman]] principles he rediscovered, applied and explained in his works.<ref>Palladio knew relatively little about Greek architecture, not yet rediscovered at his times, but he studied deeply the Roman remains during five trips to Rome.His works are heavily influenced by his studies of Greco-Roman architecture.</ref>

Andrea Palladio is known to be one of the most influential architects in Western architecture. His architectural works have "been valued for centuries as the quintessence of High Renaissance calm and harmony" (Watkin, D., ''A History of Western Architecture''). He designed many palaces, [[villa]]s and churches, but Palladio's reputation initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas.<ref>[[Howard Burns]], [http://www.cisapalladio.org/cisa/doc/bio_i.php?lingua=i&sezione=4&lingua=e ''Andrea Palladio (1508-1580)''], [[Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio]]</ref> The [[palladian villas]] are located mainly in the [[province of Vicenza]], while the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' are concentrated in the city of [[Vicenza]] and the churches in [[Venice]]. A number of his works are now protected as part of the [[World Heritage Site]] ''City of Vicenza and the [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]]''. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the ''Venice and its Lagoon'' World Heritage Site.

Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for rebuilding the hall of the town hall known as the {[Basilica]} was approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two story stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while utilizing classical proportions. The reconstruction was completed in 1617. 

Aside from Palladio's designs, his publications contributed to Palladianism. During the second half of his life, Palladio published many books, above all ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' ("The four books of architecture", Venice, 1570). Palladio is most known for his designs of villas and palaces and his books. 

The precise circumstances of his death are unknown.
Palladio died in 1580, by tradition in [[Maser, Italy|Maser]], near [[Treviso]], and was buried in the church of [[Santa Corona]] in Vicenza; from the 19th century his tomb is located in the ''Cimitero Maggiore'' of Vicenza.

Palladio's architecture was not dependent on expensive materials, which must have been an advantage to his more financially-pressed clients. Many of his buildings are of brick covered with [[stucco]]. Stuccoed brickwork was always used in his villa designs in order to portray his interpretations of the Roman villa typology.

In the later part of his career, Palladio was chosen by powerful members of  Venetian society for numerous important commissions. His success as an architect is based not only on the beauty of his work, but also for its harmony with the culture of his time. His success and influence came from the integration of extraordinary aesthetic quality with expressive characteristics that resonated with his client's social aspirations. His buildings served to visually communicate their place in the social order of their culture. This powerful integration of beauty and the physical representation of social meanings is apparent in three major building types: the urban palazzo, the agricultural villa, and the church.

Relative to his trips to Rome, Palladio developed three main palace types by 1556. In 1550, the [[Palazzo Chiericati]] was completed. The proportions for the building were based on musical ratios for adjacent rooms. The building was centralized by a tripartite division of a series of columns or colonnades.In 1552, the [[Palazzo Iseppo Porto]] located in Vicenza was rebuilt incorporating the Roman Renaissance element for facades. A colonnade of Corinthian columns surrounded a main court. The [[Palazzo Antonini]] in Udine constructed in 1556 had a centralized hall with four columns and service spaces relatively placed towards one side. He uses styles of incorporating the six columns, supported by pediments, into the walls as part of the facade. This technique had been applied in his villa designs as well. Palladio expermineted with the plan of the Palazzo Iseppo Porto by incorporating it into the [[Palazzo Thiene]]. It was an earlier project from 1545-1550 and remained uncompleted due to elaborate elevations in his designs. He utilized Mannerist elements such as stucco surface reliefs and large columns often extending two-stories high. 

In his urban structures he developed a new improved version of the typical early [[renaissance]] palazzo (exemplified by the [[Palazzo Strozzi]]). Adapting a new urban palazzo type created by [[Bramante]] in the [[House of Raphael]], Palladio found a powerful expression of the importance of the owner and his social position. The main living quarters of the owner on the second level are now clearly distinguished in importance by use of a [[pediment]]ed classical [[portico]], centered and raised above the subsidiary and utilitarian ground level (illustrated in the [[Palazzo Porto]] and the [[Palazzo Valmarana Braga]]). The tallness of the portico is achieved by incorporating the owner's sleeping quarters on the third level, within a [[Giant order|giant]] two story classical colonnade, a motif adapted from [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Capitoline]] buildings in Rome. The elevated main floor level became known as the "[[piano nobile]]", and is still referred to as the "first floor" in continental Europe.

[[File:Palladio lato.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Palladio in Vicenza]]
Palladio also established an influential new building format for the agricultural villas of the Venetian [[aristocracy]]. Palladio's approach to his villa  designs were not relative to his experience in Rome. He designed based on practicality and employed fewer reliefs. He consolidated the various stand-alone farm outbuildings into a single impressive structure, arranged as a highly organized whole dominated by a strong center and symmetrical side wings, as illustrated at [[Villa Barbaro]]. The [[Villa Rotunda]] of 1552, outside Vicenza was constructed as a summer house with views on all four sides. The plan has centralized circular halls with wings and porticos expanding on all four sides. Palladio began to implement the classical temple front into his design of facades for villas. He felt that to make an entry appear grand, the Roman temple front would be the most suitable style.The Palladian villa configuration often consists of a centralized block raised on an elevated [[podium]], accessed by grand steps and flanked by lower service wings, as at [[Villa Foscari]] and [[Villa Badoer]]. This format, with the quarters of the owner at the elevated center of their own world, found resonance as a prototype for Italian villas and later for the country estates of the British nobility (such as [[Lord Burlington]]'s [[Chiswick House]], Vanbrugh's [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], Walpole's [[Houghton Hall]], and Adam's [[Kedleston Hall]] and [http://www.paxtonhouse.co.uk/ Paxton House] in Scotland). His villas were used by a capitalist gentry who developed an interest in agriculture and land. The configuration was a perfect architectural expression of their worldview, clearly expressing their perceived position in the social order of the times.  His influence was extended worldwide into the [[British colonies]]. Palladio developed his own prototype for the plan of the villas that was flexible to moderate in scale and function. The Palladian villa format was easily adapted for a democratic worldview, as can be seen at [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and his arrangement for the [[University of Virginia]]; and as recently as 1940 in Pope's [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]] in Washington DC, where the public entry to the world of high culture occupies the exalted center position. The [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]] of exposed [[basement]] walls of Victorian residences is a late remnant of the Palladian format, clearly expressed as a podium for the main living space for the family.

Similarly, Palladio created a new configuration for the design of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] churches that established two interlocking architectural orders, each clearly articulated yet delineating a hierarchy of a larger order overriding a lesser order. This idea was in direct coincidence with the rising acceptance of the theological ideas of St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], who postulated the notion of two worlds existing simultaneously: the divine world of faith and the earthly world of man.  Palladio created an architecture which made a visual statement communicating the idea of two superimposed systems, as illustrated at [[San Francesco della Vigna]]. In a time when religious dominance in Western culture was threatened by the rising power of [[science]] and [[secular humanism|secular humanists]], this architecture found great favor with the Church as a clear statement of the proper relationship of the earthly and the spiritual worlds.

==Influence==
[[File:Palladio Titel 1642.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The front page of ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]''  (The Four Books of Architecture)]]
[[File:Frontispiece Campbell's edition of Palladio's First Book of Architecture 1728.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Frontispiece]] from [[Colen Campbell]]'s edition of Palladio's ''First Book of Architecture'', published at London, 1728]]
Palladio's influence was far-reaching, although his buildings are all in a relatively small part of Italy. One factor in the spread of his influence was the publication in 1570 of his architectural treatise ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' (The Four Books of Architecture), which set out rules others could follow. The first book includes studies of decorative styles, classical orders and materials. The second book included Palladio's town and country house designs and classical reconstructions. The third book has bridge and basilica designs, city planning designs, and classical halls. The fourth book included information on the reconstruction of ancient Roman temples. 
Before this landmark publication, architectural drawings by Palladio had appeared in print as illustrations to [[Daniele Barbaro]]'s "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]].<ref>P. Clini "Vitruvius<U+2019> Basilica at Fano: The drawings of a lost building from 'De Architectura Libri Decem'" The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. XXXIV, Part 5/W12 pp121 - 126 2002 [http://www.commission5.isprs.org/wg4/workshop_ancona/proceedings/26.pdf ISPRS.org]</ref>

Interest in his style was renewed in later generations and became fashionable all over Europe, for example in parts of the [[Loire Valley]] of France. In Britain, [[Inigo Jones]] and [[Christopher Wren]] embraced the Palladian style. In his [[Italian Journey]], [[Johann von Goethe]] describes Palladio as a genius, commending his unfinished Convent of S. Maria della Carita as the most perfect existing work of architecture. Another admirer was the architect [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]], 4th [[Earl of Cork]], also known as [[Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], who, with [[William Kent]], designed [[Chiswick House]]. The influence of Palladio even got to America. The Capitol building is an example of slightly evolved version of Palladio's works. [[Thomas Jefferson]] loved that style of architecture.
Exponents of Palladianism include the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] architect [[Giacomo Leoni]] who published an authoritative four-volume work on Palladio and his architectural concepts.

Over 330 of Palladio's original drawings and sketches still survive in the collections of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]],<ref>[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/CollectingPalladio.aspx Collecting Palladio's drawings], website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010</ref> most of which were originally owned by Inigo Jones. Jones collected a significant number of these on his Grand Tour of 1613-1614, while some were a gift from [[Henry Wotton]].<ref>[http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/DrawingsAndPublications/CollectingPalladio/InigoJonesAquiresTheDrawings.aspx Inigo Jones], website of the Royal Institute of British Architects, accessed 24 April 2010</ref>

[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a non-profit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio<U+2019>s influence in the United States.
