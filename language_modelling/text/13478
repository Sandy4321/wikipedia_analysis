'''''The Dutchess'''''{{sic}} is the solo debut [[album]] of [[United States|American]] [[pop music|pop]] singer [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], who is a member of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. The album was first released in the [[U.S.]] on [[September 19]], [[2006]]. The album was available both as an edited, clean version and a "dirty" un-edited version. The album was released internationally quickly following the U.S. release. Due to the success of the album in [[Japan]], it was re-released with six bonus tracks and a new cover.

==History==

The title is an intentional misspelling and amalgamation of the title "The [[Duchess of York]]", as Fergie (a derivative of her last name "Ferguson") and [[Sarah Ferguson]], the real Duchess of York, share a surname and nickname. [[will.i.am]] was an executive producer for the album. [[Ludacris]], [[B-Real]] from [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Rita Marley]] all make guest appearances.<ref>mtv.com MTV.com. Retrieved [[August 16]] [[2006]].</ref> Fergie has made it clear in interviews that she will still be an active member of the Black Eyed Peas.

''The Dutchess'' debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the [[United States]] with sales of more than 150,000 in its first week.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Albums&f=The+Billboard+200</ref>  51 weeks after its release (one week shy of a year), "The Dutchess" climbed to a new peak of #2 in the US.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003638789</ref>  In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it debuted at number twenty-seven with 9,110 copies sold.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} In a matter of weeks it dropped out of the chart altogether until the success of "[[Glamorous (song)|Glamorous]]" when the album shot up from seventy-seven to twenty-eight. Again, after the success of "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]", the album shot up all the way up to 19 and after dropping a few places, went back up to its #18 peak.  To date, the album has produced 3 Billboard Hot 100 #1 Hits, including ''[[London Bridge]]'', ''[[Glamorous]]'', and "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]",  with ''[[Fergalicious]]'' peaking at #2.  While "[[Clumsy]]" the 5th U.S. single has so far peaked at the #12th position on the chart. The remix of "[[Big Girls Don't Cry]]", which features [[Sean Kingston]], became a iTunes-only single and the new song "Pick It Up" (which appears on the Japanese re-released edition of the album) will become a single in Japan.

In [[Australia]], with the success of her first number-one single "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]", the album peaked at number one on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] on [[July 23]], 45 weeks after it was released. The album has shifted over 140,000 copies and is certified double platinum by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]. The album has spent 29 out of its 49 weeks in the top 50. It spent 4 consecutive weeks at number 1.<ref name="Australian charts">[http://www.ariacharts.com.au/pages/charts_display.asp?chart=1A50 Australian ARIA Top 50 Albums Chart]. [[ARIA Charts|ARIA]].
