This tour was hastily organised at very little notice when the originally planned tour of [[Argentina]] was cancelled due to terrorist theats against the players. A squad of 25 was selected, all but 3 capped, and 9 of whom (6 in the pack) had played in the match against the [[All Blacks]] at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] 9 months ago, in January. [[David Duckham]] and [[Brian 'Stack' Stevens|"Stack" Stevens]] had been, with [[John Pullin]], on the [[1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1971 Lions tour]].
