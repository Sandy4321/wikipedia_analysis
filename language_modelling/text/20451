'''Olle Emanuel Nordmark'''<ref name="termen"/> (May 25, 1890<U+2014>December 18, 1973) was a Swedish [[Painting|painter]] and [[muralist]] born in Nordanholen at [[Mockfj<U+00E4>rd]] parish. He started to draw and paint at an early age. In the beginning he was taught by his father, but in 1901 he came in contact with [[Gustaf Ankarcrona]] in [[Leksand]] who taught him the basics. At the age of 15, he had decided that he is going to become an artist.<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/> He continued his studies at [[Caleb Althin|Althin's School of Painting]] in [[Stockholm]] where he trained in fresco painting.<ref name="askart_nordmark"/><ref name="artists"/>

After his studies Nordmark worked with mural- and decorative paintings for private homes and churches in [[Sweden]]. While working his interest towards theatrical scenery started to grow. In 1917 he traveled to [[Moscow]] to study theatrical scenery. The next year he returned to [[Stockholm]], where he started to work with theatrical sceneries and drawings for costumes. He worked for among others theatres like the [[S<U+00F6>dra Teatern]], the [[Stora Teatern]], the [[Folkan]], the [[Oscars Teatern]] and the [[Royal Swedish Opera]].<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/>

Nordmark stayed in [[Stockholm]] until 1924. Mean while he became a very well known and appreciated designer of theatrical sceneries. His works were very imaginative, beautiful and colorful. Nordmark worked also with [[Karl Gerhard]] on sets for 22 productions. During his time in [[Stockholm]] he worked also as the head of Grabowska a decorative painting workshop at [[Karlav<U+00E4>gen]] and arranged a number of displays in the news-office window of [[Svenska Dagbladet]] for among others [[Barn<U+00E4>ngens Tekniska Fabriker|Barn<U+00E4>ngen]] and [[Finbruken]].<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/>

He decorate also several churches like [[Engelbrektskyrkan]], [[Saltsj<U+00F6>badskyrkan]], churches in [[Bor<U+00E5>s]] and [[Karlskrona]] and the wedding hall in [[Stockholm Court House]]. In 1924 Nordmark participated for free in the restoration of the church in [[Mockfj<U+00E4>rd]], because of his love for his homestead.<ref name="dalpilen89"/><ref name="dalpilen28"/> The same year he started to paint a portrait of G<U+00E4>dd Lars, which he finished in [[United States|America]] and then donated to the church in [[Mockfj<U+00E4>rd]].<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/>

To acquire more knowledge within his field, he made several study trips on the European continent to for example [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Russia]]. In 1924 he emigrated to America in search for a broader working field than what [[Sweden]] could offer him. He lived there until 1964 when he moved to [[France]]. In America leading Broadway theater directors noticed him immediately and he worked in some sets for productions.<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/> Mostly he worked though with mural paintings for private commission in [[New York]].<ref name=artists/> Known decorations made by him are among others the [[American Swedish Historical Museum]] and the John Ericsson Room in the John Morton Memorial Building in Philadelphia,<ref name="mockfjard"/><ref name=johnmorton>[http://www.nordicway.com/tour/?p=tour/view&id=274 "Day 265 - American Swedish Historical Museum"] Nordic Way (retrieved 2012-03-31)</ref> narthex ceiling of the First Swedish Baptist Church of New York<ref name=baptistchurch>[http://www.nordicway.com/tour/?p=tour/view&id=240 "Day 231 - The Swedish Church"] Nordic Way (retrieved 2012-03-31)</ref> and the [[Nationality_Rooms#Swedish|Swedish Room]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref name=mockfjard/>

Nordmark also participated in several exhibitions, including one  at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in the year 1932<ref name=brooklynmuseum>[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/1084/tab/press_releases/ Press release] Brooklyn Museum, 1932-04-03</ref> and another at the [[Alma Reed|Delphic Studios]] in [[New York]].<ref name=mockfjard/> He wrote also the books ''Modern Methods and Techniques for Painting in Fresco and Secco'' (1947) and ''Course in Beginning Oil Painting'' (1960).

Nordmark died at the end of 1973 in [[France]].

== Teaching ==

Although it is not known when Nordmark started to teach, it is possible that he had a summer art school at his studio in Lomala, [[Hopewell Junction]], [[New York]], already in the early 1930s.{{#tag:ref|It is believed that Nordmark introduced his [[fresco secco|secco]] techniques into the [[United States]] in 1932.<ref name="burt"/>{{rp|14}} Lomala appears in the references as Lomala House<ref name="marsh"/>{{rp|23}}, "Lomala" a house in [[Hopewell Junction]]<ref name="hirschl"/> or just plain Lomala in letters<ref name="marsh-papers"/> from [[George Biddle|Biddle]] and Nordmark to [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Marsh]].|group="note"}} Among his first known students were [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]] and [[Elsa Jemne]]. In 1934 Marsh traveled to Lomala to learn the art of fresco painting from Nordmark, in anticipation of his commission to execute murals. He stayed for about six months with Nordmark studying fresco techniques.<ref name="marsh"/>{{rp|23}} Marsh returned to Lomala in July 1935 with [[George Biddle]] to get extra training right before their mural projects in the Post Office Department Building in [[Washington, D.C.]]{{#tag:ref|Letters from [[George Biddle|Biddle]] dated June 17, 1935 and July 4, 1935.<ref name="marsh-papers"/>|group="note"}} [[Elsa Jemne|Jemne]] studied also fresco techniques with Nordmark at Lomala in preparation for future work in 1935.<ref name="crump"/>{{rp|114}}<ref name="mecklenburg"/>{{rp|74}}

[[George Biddle|Biddle]] and [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Marsh]] employed Nordmark to superintend their mural projects in the Post Office Department Building.<ref name="leavitt"/><ref name="nordmark"/>{{rp|79<U+2013>86}} Nordmark was involved with the project from around August 1935 to early 1936.{{#tag:ref|Nordmark had a frequent mail correspondence with Marsh about the progress of the preparation of the walls for the mural paintings from around August 1935 to the end of January 1936.<ref name="marsh-papers"/>|group="note"}} In order that Nordmark would truly be able to superintend the project, [[George Biddle|Biddle]] hoped to induce [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]] to give Nordmark some sort of work in [[Washington, D.C.]] It is possible that Nordmark was employed by the [[Resettlement Administration]] around October 1935.{{#tag:ref|[[George Biddle|Biddle]] wrote in a letter dated June 17, 1935 about his hopes to find Nordmark some kind of work in [[Washington, D.C.]] Nordmark told in a letter dated September 19, 1935 that he had applied for a job and would get to know the outcome in about one week. In a letter dated January 27, 1936 it is possible to read between the lines that Nordmark might be working for a governmental institution. [[Olin Dows]] again writes in a letter dated December 9, 1936 that Nordmark is still working for the Resettlement.<ref name="marsh-papers"/> The Resettlement is assumed to be the [[Resettlement Administration]].|group="note"}} He served later as a technical consultant for the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture|Section of Fine Art]] and supervised mural paintings made by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artists.<ref name="nelson"/>

[[George Biddle|Biddle]] spent a summer studying fresco techniques with Nordmark, before he began his work in the [[Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building|Department of Justice Building]] in 1936.<ref name="mecklenburg"/>{{rp|17}} Like a year before, Nordmark was hired to supervise the mural projects of [[George Biddle|Biddle]] and [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Henry Varnum Poor]].<ref name="nordmark"/>{{rp|79<U+2013>86}}<ref name="arts"/> In 1937 Nordmark joined Marsh in [[New York City]] for the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|Custom House]] murals. Marsh had insisted on using fresco for the murals, despite of objections from higher-ups.<ref name="leavitt"/>{{#tag:ref|No records have been found if Nordmark was employed by [[George Biddle|Biddle]] and [[Henry Varnum Poor (designer)|Poor]] for the [[Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building|Department of Justice Building]] project and by Marsh for the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|Custom House]] project or was he employed by the government for these projects.|group="note"}} Nordmark worked also as a federal [[artist-in-residence]] in [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] in 1937, where [[Andrew Standing Soldier]] was studying under him.{{#tag:ref|[[Andrew Standing Soldier|Standing Soldier]] did some experimental mural work at the Oglala Community High School under the direction of Indian Service advisers and the special summer school staff in art in 1937.<ref name="clark"/>{{rp|92}} Other sources<ref name="akta"/> tells that he was studying under Nordmark, a federal [[artist-in-residence]], in [[Pine Ridge Reservation|Pine Ridge]]. Therefore it is likely that Nordmark worked as an [[artist-in-residence]] in [[Pine Ridge Reservation|Pine Ridge]] in 1937.|group="note"}}

The [[Department of the Interior|Department of the Interiors's]] [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] employed Nordmark to teach fresco painting to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] from 1938 to 1943.<ref name="wwaa"/>{{#tag:ref|According to some sources<ref name="mockfjardsskolan"/> Nordmark was employed by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] from 1935 to 1943. This period might includes also work done for other governmental institutions.|group="note"}} He was working at the Indian Art Center, a program for outstanding students and teachers, in [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]], from 1938 to 1940.{{#tag:ref|In literature Indian Art Center and Fort Sill Indian School are used interchangeably. The program, called Indian Art Center, was not part of Fort Sill Indian School.<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}} It was located at the [[United States Army]] base in [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]].<ref name="anthes"/>{{rp|202}}|group="note"|name="fortsill"}} In 1940 instructors and students from [[Phoenix Indian School]], [[Phoenix, Arizona]], traveled to [[Fort Sill]] to study under Nordmark.<ref name="anthes"/>{{rp|202}} There is little known about the Indian Art Center. Some records of the program probably exist, but many may have been destroyed. According to [[Leonard Riddles]] the students were taught tempera painting, oil painting, fresco and secco.<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}}

[[Oscar Jacobson]], director of [[University of Oklahoma]] art department and founder of the university's art museum, criticized Nordmark's teaching. Commissioner [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] was forced to defend it. He replied that Nordmark taught only techniques and never dictated style, design or colors to his students. This was proved by the uniquely individualistic work of [[Andrew Standing Soldier|Standing Soldier]], who was studying again with Nordmark at the Indian Art Center in circa 1938,{{#tag:ref|[[Andrew Standing Soldier|Standing Soldier]] must have been studying with Nordmark between 1938 and 1940. He finished painting a mural at the new [[United States Post Office<U+2013>Blackfoot Main|federal post office]] at Blackfoot, Idaho, in 1939,<ref name="benes"/>{{rp|85}} therefore it is assumed that he must have been studying with Nordmark before that.|group="note"}} and of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who painted murals in the [[Main Interior Building|Department of the Interior Building]].<ref name="benes"/>{{rp|85<U+2013>86}}

Among Nordmark's other known students at the Indian Art Center were
* [[Spencer Asah]], [[James Auchiah]], [[Stephen Mopope]] and [[Leonard Riddles]] in 1938,<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}}<ref name="mclerran"/>{{rp|264}}{{#tag:ref|[[Spencer Asah|Asah]],<ref name="matuz"/>{{rp|28}} [[James Auchiah|Auchiah]]<ref name="matuz"/>{{rp|34}} and [[Stephen Mopope|Mopope]]<ref name="matuz"/>{{rp|391}} were studying with Nordmark in 1938. The source locates the students at Fort Sill Indian School instead of Indian Art Center. See.<ref group="note" name="fortsill"/>|group="note"}}
* [[Archie Blackowl]], [[Franklin Gritts]], [[Cecil Murdock]] and [[Andrew Tsihnahjinnie]] in 1939,<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}}
* [[Allan Houser]],{{#tag:ref|[[Allan Houser|Houser]] studied with Nordmark either at Indian Art Center<ref name="croteau"/>{{rp|181}}<ref name="look"/>{{rp|162}} or Fort Sill Indian School<ref name="leibowitz"/>{{rp|311}} depending on source. See.<ref group="note" name="fortsill"/> [[Allan Houser|Houser]] studied one year at Fort Sill Indian School in 1922<ref name="pearlman"/>{{rp|7}}, which might also be one reason for the confusion.|group="note"}} [[Oscar Howe]]<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}}<ref name="anthes"/>{{rp|157}} and [[Victor Pepion]]<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}}<ref name="mclerran"/>{{rp|264}} in 1940.

[[Blackbear Bosin]],<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}} [[Woody Crumbo]],<ref name="wyckoff"/>{{rp|36}} [[Charles Loloma]]<ref name="benes"/>{{rp|104}},<ref name="snodgrass"/> [[Fred Kabotie]]<ref name="benes"/>{{rp|104}} and David Williams, Sr.<ref name="croteau"/>{{rp|181}} studied also with Nordmark at the Indian Art Center, but more detailed information about their years of attendance have not been found. [[Gerald Nailor, Sr.]] studied with Nordmark in 1940, but the location is uncertain. According to literature he studied either privately in Oklahoma<ref name="park"/>{{rp|175}} or Fort Sill Indian School, [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]], [[Oklahoma]].<ref name="mclerran"/>{{rp|264}}<ref name="leibowitz"/>{{rp|311}} Some sources<ref name="leibowitz"/>{{rp|311}} tells that [[Gerald Nailor, Sr.|Nailor]] enrolled with his close friend [[Allan Houser|Houser]] for one year at the Fort Sill Indian School.

Nordmark was probably teaching at the [[Phoenix Indian School]] from 1941 to 1943. Among his students were [[W. Richard West, Sr.|Richard West]] from 1941 to 1942<ref name="snodgrass"/><ref name="jones"/> and [[Patrick DesJarlait]] likely in 1942.<ref name="anthes"/>{{rp|202}} [[George Watchetaker|George Smith "Woogee" Watchetaker]]<ref  name="naa"/> and [[Herman Toppah]]<ref name="snodgrass"/> studied also with Nordmark, but the references do not give any further information about neither the location nor the year. Later [[Oscar Jacobson|Jacobson]] and Nordmark mentored together some Philbrook artists including [[Woody Crumbo|Crumbo]], [[Albin Jake]] and Jesse Edwin Davis II.<ref name="croteau"/>{{rp|181}}

Nordmark worked as advisor or supervisor for many mural painting projects. Some of the projects he supervised were made by
* [[James Auchiah|Auchiah]], [[Archie Blackowl|Blackowl]], [[Woody Crumbo|Crumbo]], [[Franklin Gritts|Gritts]], [[Stephen Mopope|Mopope]], [[Leonard Riddles|Riddles]] at Fort Sill Indian School from 1939 to 1940,<ref name="mclerran"/>{{rp|265}}
* [[James Auchiah|Auchiah]], [[Woody Crumbo|Crumbo]], [[Velino Herrera|Herrera]], [[Allan Houser|Houser]], [[Stephen Mopope|Mopope]], [[Gerald Nailor Sr.|Nailor]] at [[Main Interior Building|Department of the Interior Building]], [[Washington D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], from 1939 to 1940,<ref name="mclerran"/>{{rp|176}}
* [[Victor Pepion|Pepion]] at [[Museum of the Plains Indian]], [[Browning, Montana]] in the summer of 1941.<ref name="nelson"/>{{rp|47}}
