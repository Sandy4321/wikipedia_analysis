'''''Confusion''''' is a [[studio album]] by Nigerian [[Afrobeat]] musician [[Fela Kuti]] and his band the Africa 70. It was arranged, composed, and produced by Kuti, and released in 1975 by [[EMI]]. He recorded the album after choosing to emphasize his African heritage and nationalism in his music. ''Confusion'' is a commentary on the confused state of [[post-colonial]] [[Lagos]] and its lack of [[infrastructure]] and proper leadership at the time. Kuti's [[West African Pidgin English|pidgin English]] lyrics depict difficult conditions in the city, including a frenetic, multilingual [[street market|trading market]] and inextricable traffic jams in Lagos' major intersections.

A one-song Afrobeat album, ''Confusion'' begins with an entirely instrumental first half, which features [[free form jazz|free form]] interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]. It leads to an extended mid-tempo section with Allen's [[polyrhythm]]s and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers [[call and response|call-and-response]] vocal passages. In retrospective reviews, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In 2000 and 2010, ''Confusion'' was [[reissue]]d and bundled with Kuti's 1973 album ''[[Gentleman (album)|Gentleman]]''. 

== Background ==
After becoming dissatisfied with studying European composers at the [[Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance|Trinity College of Music]], Fela Kuti formed his first band Koola Lobitos in 1961 and quickly became a popular act in the [[London]] club scene. He returned to his native [[Nigeria]] in 1963 and formed another band that played a rhythmic fusion of traditional [[highlife]] music and [[jazz]]. Kuti dubbed his hybrid style "[[Afrobeat]]", which served in part as his critique of African performers whom he felt had forsaken their native musical roots for contemporary American popular music trends. In 1969, he toured with his band in [[Los Angeles]] and was introduced by a friend to the writings of [[black nationalism|Black nationalist]] and [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentrist]] proponents such as [[Malcolm X]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]]. Inspired by what he had read, Kuti decided to write more political and critical music, and changed the name of his band to Nigeria 70 and later on Africa 70.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dougan|first=John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fela-kuti-mn0000138833|title=Fela Kuti|publisher=[[Allmusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=14 July 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6I6aO9q8n|archivedate=14 July 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Kuti began to emphasize his identification with Africa and its culture in his music over the [[Postcolonialism|colonial mentality]] of identification with [[Western culture|Western powers]] such as the United States and United Kingdom. His albums during this period expressed aspects of his idealogy such as his African heritage and nationalism. On his 1973 song "Eko lie", Kuti declared that [[Lagos]] was his home rather than London or [[New York City]], where he had performed earlier in his career.{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=248}} Lagos and its landmark events became common themes in his songs.{{sfn|Olaniyan|2004|p=92}} He revisited the theme on ''Confusion'' in 1974 to acknowledge that he identifies with the city despite its problems.{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=249}}

== Lyrics ==
[[File:Market in Lagos, Nigeria.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Kuti describes a multilingual, frenetic trading market in his portrayal of [[Lagos]].]]
The album is a commentary on the confused state of post-colonial, urban Nigeria, particularly Lagos, and its lack of [[infrastructure]] and proper leadership at the time.<ref name="Samuelson"/> In the opening lines, Kuti comments on his [[social reality]]: "When we talk say confusion / Everything out of control".<ref name="Ambrose">{{cite journal|last=Ambrose|first=Robert|page=26|title=Confusion and Courage|journal=The Beat|year=2001|volume=20|location=Los Angeles}}</ref> His lyrics decry what he viewed as the colonial mindset of some Africans,{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=436}} and employ [[West African Pidgin English|pidgin English]], which was the [[lingua franca]] of most people in English-speaking West Africa;{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=223}} he sings the phrase "pafuka", which means "all over" or "finished", and the interjection "o" to add emphasis.{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=433}} 

According to Nigerian historian [[Toyin Falola]], ''Confusion'' addresses the "infrastructural nightmare of Lagos and the continued [[hegemony]] of the West in all aspects of African life" in its depiction of the complicated, frenetic, and multilingual market of the Ojuelegba crossroad.{{sfn|Falola|Salm|2005|p=328}} Kuti makes reference to three [[dialect]]s and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult:<ref name="Samuelson"/> "Dem be three men wey sell for roadside-o / Dem three speak different language-o / Dem speak Lagos, [[Accra]], and [[Conakry]] / One white man come pay them money-o / He pay them for [[Pound (currency)|pounds]], [[dollar]]s and [[French franc|French money]]-o / For the thing wey he go buy from them / He remain for them to share am-o / Me I say, na confusion be that-o / He go say he pafuka o."{{sfn|Falola|Salm|2005|p=328}} ''[[African Arts (journal)|African Arts]]'' journalist E.J. Collins interpreted the latter verse as a reference to the protracted nature of [[Financial transaction|transactions]] in Lagos.<ref name="Collins">{{cite journal|journal=[[African Arts (journal)|African Arts]]|location=Los Angeles|page=60|volume=10|issue=2|month=January|year=1977|title=Post-War Popular Band Music in West Africa|last=Collins|first=E.J.}}</ref>

Kuti uses ironic humor to express pride in Nigerians' ability to drive and work within difficult conditions: "Before-before Lagos traffic na special, eh / Number one special all over the world / You go get [[Ph.D.]] for driving for Lagos, eh / You go get [[M.A.]] for driving for Lagos, eh / You go get [[M.Sc.]] for driving for Lagos, oh / For me for me I like am like that, eh / Ah-ha-ha-ha, na my country <U+2013> why not? / For me for me I like am like that, eh."{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=251}} He subsequently describes major intersections throughout Lagos, including [[Surulere]], Ojuelegba, and Ogogoro Centre, which lack the supervision of a [[traffic officer]]. They are characterized by aggressive, temperamental drivers, who force their vehicles into inextricable [[traffic jam]]s: "For Ojuelegba, moto dey come from south / Moto dey come from north / Moto dey come from east / Moto dey come from west / And policeman no dey for centre / Na confusion be that-i o / He go say he pafuka o."{{sfn|Fairfax|1993|p=251}} According to ''[[Rough Guides|The Rough Guide to World Music]]'' (2006), the album uses a "hectic crossroads in Lagos ... as a metaphor to explore the problems of an entire corrupt nation."{{sfn|Broughton|Ellingham|Lusk|2006|p=302}}

== Release and reception ==
''Confusion'' was first released in Nigeria in 1975 by [[EMI]].{{sfn|Veal|2000|p=296}} It was [[reissue]]d in 1984 by [[EMI Records]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Afro Hot 20|journal=[[Blues & Soul]]|page=47|issue=419|location=Croydon|year=1984}}</ref> In a retrospective review for [[Allmusic]], Sam Samuelson gave it five stars and called it "a highly recommended 25-minute Afro-beat epic". He said that it shows Kuti and his band at the peak of their instrumental skills and vague jeers, which he felt became more explicit and intense on 1977's ''[[Zombie (album)|Zombie]]''. Samuelson found ''Confusion'' to be exemplary of Kuti's "genius" formula, in which he startles musically enraptured listeners with his commentary.<ref name="Samuelson"/> Music journalist [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] called it a lyrical masterpiece and said that the bridge following the song's "cosmic" introduction is "pretty much the pinnacle of [[Afro-futurism]]".{{sfn|Shapiro et al.|2009|p=99}} [[Piero Scaruffi]] called it one of Kuti's most challenging compositions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scaruffi|first=Piero|authorlink=Piero Scaruffi|year=1999|url=http://www.scaruffi.com/vol1/kuti.html|title=Fela Anikulapo Kuti|publisher=Piero Scaruffi|accessdate=24 February 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6EfL3dPKT|archivedate=24 February 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Nic Harcourt]] recommended ''Confusion'' as a starting point for new listeners of Kuti's music.{{sfn|Harcourt|2005|p=13}}
