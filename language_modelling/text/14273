The '''Linn Sondek LP12''' (often shortened to '''Sondek''' or '''LP12''') is a highly regarded transcription [[phonograph|turntable]]<ref name=1993stereophile> Greenberg, Corey (1 December 1993). [http://www.stereophile.com/turntables/linn_sondek_lp12_turntable_amp_klyde_phono_cartridge/index.html "Linn Sondek LP12 turntable & Klyde phono cartridge"]. ''Stereophile''</ref> produced by [[Glasgow]]-based [[Linn Products]], manufacturers of hi-fi, [[home cinema|home theatre]], and multi-room audio systems. Its name is derived from the 12" vinyl LP (long play [[gramophone record]]).

''The Absolute Sound''  ranked it the second most significant turntable of all time in 2011.<ref name=TAS216/> With its iconic success, Linn named their flagship CD player the ''Sondek CD12''.<ref>Lander, David (1 November 2001). [http://www.stereophile.com/interviews/1101ivor "Ikonoklast: Linn's Ivor Tiefenbrun"]</ref>

== History ==
The Sondek LP12 turntable, introduced in 1972, utilises a suspended sub-chassis design and a patented tightly-toleranced single-point [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]. The LP12 has evolved since its introduction, but its basic suspended sub-chassis design has remained.<ref name=stereophile>[http://stereophile.com/turntables/1103linn/ Linn LP Playing System], Michael Fremer, ''[[Stereophile]]'', November 2003</ref> At the time, the design was similar to the Ariston RD11<ref>''Hi-Fi News & Record Review'', Vol. 6, No. 2, February 1973</ref> and the [[Thorens]] TD150, both in turn based on the Acoustic Research XA turntable that was launched in 1961.<ref>[http://www.hi-fiworld.co.uk/hfw/oldeworldehtml/aristonturntable.html OLDE WORLDE <U+2013> ARISTON RD11 TURNTABLE], David Price, ''Hi-Fi World'' Magazine</ref> The XA was created by renowned audio pioneer [[Edgar Villchur]].<ref name=20091023avguide>Gregory, Roy (23 October 2009). [http://www.avguide.com/review/the-vpi-classic-turntable-hifi-plus-68 "The VPI Classic Turntable"]. ''HiFi-Plus'', Issue 68 </ref> The three-point "suspended sub-chassis" of the XA, using a compression spring system, was much improved upon and popularised in the LP12.<ref name=20091023avguide/> 

The thinking at the time was that the most important component of a high-end audio system is the loudspeakers. Linn presented an important challenge to that by claiming that the source (i.e. the turntable) was the most important part of the system.<ref name=1993stereophile/>

[[Ivor Tiefenbrun]] has talked about how Sondek derives from the word Soundex as each hi-fi design always ends up having its own unique identifiable and recognisable sound.<ref>[http://www.positive-feedback.com/pfbackissues/0706/Ivor.7n6.html "Interview with Ivor Tiefenbrun"]. ''Positive Feedback'' (2002)</ref> Some report the original name was just Sondek without the LP12.{{cquote|Linn didn't invent the turntable, we simply understood that there was more information on an LP record than people were capable of accessing, so we applied our understanding of engineering to extracting it.<br>Ivor Tiefenbrun, 2007<ref>Wes Phillips, Linn's Klimax DS, ''Stereophile'', 16 September 2007</ref>}}

Early versions were a platform for mounting third party tonearms, had a basic power supply arrangements, and would only revolve at 33<U+2153>&nbsp;rpm. Those users requiring a 45&nbsp;rpm option would have to purchase a special adaptor to increase the diameter of the motor pulley and platter speed accordingly.

Throughout the years, there have been many changes which have significantly improved this table. These changes include modifications to components such as the subplatter and bearing, rubber feet, baseboard, armboard, suspension springs and grommets and reinforced plinth. A much improved on-board PSU, the ''Valhalla'', was marketed as an upgrade option. Later, external power supplies became ''de rigueur'' firstly with the introduction of the Linn ''Lingo'', and later the ''Radikal''.

== Partnered tonearms and power supplies ==
Like most turntable units, many options to partner the LP12 are available (including Linn's own) for tonearms, cartridges and, to a much lesser extent, power supplies. Although Linn constantly espouses the virtues of a "pure" Linn system, and there is much talked about synergies with other Linn components, the ''LP12'' user has the option of a number of third party options. Before the existence of Linn-branded tonearms, Linn was the importer for Grace, and used their ''707'' tonearm. The Sumiko tonearm and later the Mission ''774'' arm were also popular choices and much spoken of. The first Linn-badged arm, the ''Ittok LVII'', was in production 1979-93. A 3-point-mounted arm with a large-bore arm tube designed and manufactured in Japan.<ref>Harrison, Andrew (March 2009). [http://www.hi-fiworld.co.uk/vinyl-lp/34-arms/159-funk-firm-ittok.html "Blak Magic &ndash; Tik-Tok: An Ittok Timeline"]. ''Hi-fi World''</ref> It was gradually superseded by the ''Ekos''. A budget arm, the ''Basik LVX'', was produced from 1983 to 1986, and replaced by the ''Akito''. For today's demanding audiophile, LP12 is commonly partnered with the Linn ''Ekos SE'' tonearm; the unipivot ''ARO'' tonearm from [[Naim Audio]] is also very popular. 

External power options include Linn's own top of the line ''Radikal'' power supply featuring an auto-calibrating speed management system; Naim Audio manufactures the ''Armageddon'' power supply for the LP12, based on its own ''Hi-Cap'' power supply unit.<ref name=quaschik1>Quaschik, Hartmut (September 2004). [http://www.webcitation.org/64ecyY1jk "Linn Sondek LP12 <U+2013> turntable &mdash; A definitely pre-loved item"]. TNT Germany. Archived from [http://www.tnt-audio.com/sorgenti/linn_lp12_e.html the original] on 13 January 2012.</ref>

Linn were distributors for Grace and Supex Corporation at the time, and thus the Supex ''SD900'' and ''SD1000'' phono cartridges were also frequently partners for the deck.<ref name=20040104messenger>Messenger, Paul (4 January 2004). [http://www.stereophile.com/phonocartridges/200linn/index.html "Linn Arkiv B phono cartridge"]. ''Stereophile''</ref> Early Linn-branded cartridges, such as the ''Asak'' and ''Asaka'', and the 3-point mounted ''Troika'' (now discontinued), were produced by Supex for Linn.<ref name=20040104messenger/> Linn's later subcontracted cartridge manufacture to Lyra Corporation in Japan. Paul Messenger, writing in ''Stereophile'', credits Linn's endorsement and importation of the Supex brand for the resurgence of audiophile interest in moving coil cartridges.<ref name=20040104messenger/> 

Naim Audio manufactured the Linn-branded head amplifier (phono amplifier), the ''Linnk''. Linn today manufacturers the ''Uphorik'' ("euphoric"), and ''Urika'' ("eureka") phono pre-amplifier that can be powered by the ''Radikal''.

Linn capitalised on the success of the ''Sondek LP12'' by introducing the more affordable ''Basik'' and ''Axis'' turntables, complementary tonearms for the ''Sondek'' and [[magnetic cartridge|cartridges]] at different price points.

== Popularity ==
The LP12 is popular with many audiophiles around the world for its excellent ability to play music with "pace, rhythm and timing".<ref name=quaschik1/> It is sometimes used by hi-fi reviewers as a reference turntable.<ref>[http://www.tonearm.co.uk/silver-stereo-times-review.htm Origin Live Silver Tonearm], Paul Szabady, ''Stereo Times'', November 2001</ref>{{cquote|It<U+2019>s impossible to imagine the high-end industry without the LP12".|20px|20px|Robert Harley<ref name=TAS216/>}}
It was at its most popular in the golden age of vinyl playback, principally the 1970s through to the 1980s. David Thompson, writing in ''Record Collector News'', said that the LP12 enjoyed a "stranglehold on the qualities of LP reproduction for many years".<ref>Thompson, David (December 2013). [http://recordcollectornews.com/2013/12/divine-revelation/ "Divine Revelation"]. ''Record Collector News''</ref> Its closest competitors were probably the [[Roksan Xerxes]], the Well Tempered Table, several Thorens decks (TD125/126, TD160, TD2001/3001).<ref> [http://www.webcitation.org/64ecyY1jk "Linn Sondek LP12 <U+2013> turntable &mdash; A definitely pre-loved item"]. TNT Germany. Archived from [http://www.tnt-audio.com/sorgenti/linn_lp12_e.html the original] on 13 January 2012.</ref> the Michell GyroDec, the Dunlop Systemdek, the Logic DM-101 and the [[Pink Triangle (audio manufacturer)|Pink Triangle]] PT1. However, the LP12 outsold them all in the United Kingdom.<ref>Sircom, Alan (2 July 2013). [http://www.hifiplus.com/articles/roksan-xerxes20plus-turntable-system/?utm_campaign=Hi-Fi%2B+Weekly+Emails&utm_medium=email&utm_source=email-134 "Roksan Xerxes.20Plus Turntable System"]. ''Hi-Fi+''</ref> In fact, TNT asserts that "most foreign manufacturers of hi-end turntables didn't even bother to import" because they were faced with an uphill fight. Critics and reviewers would all too frequently conclude of any imported competitor that "an LP12 is better and you could buy two {{sic|Linn's}} for that money".<ref name=TNTAudio200211>Husband, Geoff (November 2002). [http://www.webcitation.org/6I1Y5okbT "Roksan Xerxes X turntable and Artemiz arm"], TNT Audio. Archived from [http://www.tnt-audio.com/sorgenti/xerxes_e.html the original] on 11 July 2013.</ref>

The LP12 has acquired such cult status<ref name=stereophile/> amongst audiophile turntables that many seek to knock it off its pedestal. Although the design has not been fundamentally revisited,<ref>[http://www.soundstage.com/revequip/linn_ikemi.htm Linn Ikemi CD Player], Marc Mickelson, Soundstage.com, November 1999</ref> there have been improvements to the turntable's design since its launch using advances in material science, over 40&nbsp;years ago. It remains possible to buy a Sondek LP12 in a configuration not dissimilar to one made in 1973.<ref name=TAS216/> In 2004, ''Stereophile'' said it was "a classic, a revolutionary, an iconoclast, a survivor."<ref name=stereophile/> In 2011, ranking the LP12 the second "Most Significant Turntables of All Time" for ''The Absolute Sound'', Robert Harley said: "It<U+2019>s impossible to imagine the high-end industry without the LP12".<ref name=TAS216/>

== Important upgrades ==
(''in chronological order'')

'''Lingo Power Supply''' (''Introduced: 1990'')
Linn describes the ''LINGO'' as a "high precision, direct coupled, power supply designed to sit alongside the LP12 turntable". Prior to the Lingo, speed accuracy for 33 rpm (and 45 rpm) rotation was determined by the ''Valhalla'' power supply board. 

The Lingo generates two 50 Hz [[sine wave|sinusoidal waveforms]] which it amplifies and sends to the turntable motor &ndash; the Valhalla generates a single sine wave.<ref name=19910110stereophile>Atkinson, John (10 January 1991). [http://www.stereophile.com/turntables/513 "Linn Sondek LP12 turntable with Lingo power supply"], ''Stereophile''</ref> Using crystal oscillators, one for 33<U+2153> rpm and one for 45 rpm. the two speeds are made possible. When depressed, the switch on the turntable supplies the start-up torque with which the deck's desired rotation speed is achieved. the switch on the turntable allows selection of the appropriate oscillator the output of which is fed into a synchronous counter to produce a 50&nbsp;Hz or 67.5&nbsp;Hz square wave for 33<U+2153> rpm and 45 rpm respectively. The square wave is filtered into a clean sine wave to minimise motor vibration, and amplified to 120V to feed the turntable.<ref name=19910110stereophile/>

'''The Cirkus upgrade''' (''Introduced: 1993'')
The Cirkus kit aims to provide the LP12 with greater stability and ensure the bearing sits perfectly true to the chassis, through a redesigned bearing and stronger sub-chassis assembly. 

The bearing housing height has been increased to improve lubrication; its mounting flange thickness has been substantially increased; the geometry of the top and bottom liners in the bearing housing has been altered to further reduce incidence of rocking. Thickness of the sub-chassis was doubled to improve rigidity, reduce flexing and improve control of the relationship between turntable platter and arm.<ref>[http://www.vinylengine.com/linn-lp12-history-and-upgrade-path.shtml "Linn LP12 History and Upgrade path"], Vinyl Engine, 3 May 2002</ref> With the new bearing comes a new sub-platter.<ref>[http://www.neilmcbride.co.uk/cirkus.html "Linn LP12 Upgrade Kit <U+2013> The Cirkus"] neilmcbride.co.uk</ref>

'''Keel''' (''Introduced: 2006'')
The Keel upgrade to the LP12 is a replacement subchassis, machined from solid aluminium. It builds on the Cirkus upgrade (now fitted as standard to new LP12s) but is not included as standard in 'regular' production LP12s. Linn claims that the Keel is an application of its "close-tolerance aluminium machining", first seen in the ingot casing of the ''Sondek CD12'' CD player. The Keel, along with the Ekos SE tonearm and Trampolin Mk.2 were three Special Edition upgrades for the turntable's 33<U+2153> birthday, 33<U+2153> being the standard rotational speed when playing LPs.

'''Trampolin Mark 2''' (''Introduced: 2006'')
The original Trampolin baseboard was made from [[medium-density fibreboard|MDF]], rather than [[masonite]], incorporating damping feet which were optimised for LP12 to be placed on heavy furniture. The Trampolin II is made from aluminium.

'''Radikal''' (''Introduced: 2009'')
The 'Radikal' system, priced at <U+00A3>2,500, comprises a "control box", DC motor and power supply which, according to Linn, offers more accurate speed control, and reduced vibration and resonance. This is achieved by using on-board speed management system with automatic calibration, and use of a new motor with low magnetic field and electrical noise, located within a machined housing.<ref>[http://www.whathifi.com/news/Linn-hits-the-road-to-demonstrate-its-Radikal-turntable-upgrades/ "Linn hits the road to demonstrate its Radikal turntable upgrades"], ''What Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision'', 27 April 2009</ref><ref>Dudley, Art (30 June 2011). [http://www.stereophile.com/content/listening-102 "Listening #102]. ''Stereophile''</ref> It can be used to power the Urika phono amplifier or the Linn phonostage mounted inside the turntable.
