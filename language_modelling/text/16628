==Background==
On December 4, 2013, while doing a press run for the launch of his SMS Audio line of headphones and speakers he announced that a "full body of work", titled ''Animal Ambition'' would be released in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=by Emmanuel C.M. |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/12/50-cent-putting-out-new-project-in-january/ |title=50 Cent Putting Out New Project In January - XXL |publisher=Xxlmag.com |date=2013-12-06 |accessdate=2014-03-22}}</ref> In a December 2013, interview with [[DJ Whoo Kid]], he reiterated plans for the album, saying: "I'm going to drop it in January, it's a full body of work, I wouldn't call it a mixtape because it's a higher grade than the material that I put out on mixtapes. I recorded so many album quality songs that I'm going to put the Animal project out as my viral marketing plan and then it will come out after, ''Street King Immortal''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Meara |first=Paul |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.26540/title.50-cent-reflects-on-nelson-mandela-s-legacy-importance |title=50 Cent Reflects On Nelson Mandela's Legacy & Importance |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2013-12-08 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> In January 2014, while visiting the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], he explained his motivation to release new music in early 2014, saying: "I<U+2019>m so anxious to put out material. It took me so long to get the business portion of music straight, because I had went through an auditing process because it was the last record required for Interscope Records. And now, I got ''Animal Ambition'', I was inspired to write this. It really has to be current. If it<U+2019>s not like right now, what I feel is like the hottest thing, I know it<U+2019>s done right, but it<U+2019>s not necessarily what I should be doing right now."<ref name="hiphopdx1">{{cite web|last=Balfour |first=Jay |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.26968/title.50-cent-details-animal-ambition-release-plans |title=50 Cent Details "Animal Ambition" Release Plans |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref>

In a January 2014 interview with ''Sonic Electronix'', he said that he was recording heavily in preparation for both of the albums, saying, "I want to put ''Animal Ambition'' out in the first quarter. And then it<U+2019>ll lead up to ''Street King Immortal''. So it<U+2019>ll be twelve weeks. That<U+2019>s why I<U+2019>m working so hard, when I leave here I go straight back to record again."<ref name="hiphopdx1"/> He also said that ''Animal Ambition'' has a shared sound and theme throughout, saying, "With ''Animal Ambition'', the project is about prosperity. I got an interesting way of writing it, <U+2018>cause I wrote it from a distorted vision or viewpoint. When Biggie was doing <U+2018>Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper, damn,<U+2019> that<U+2019>s about when you get something, the effects of others responding to you doing better. The jealousies connected to it, there<U+2019>s so many different ways to write it, that the album has those facets to it. The overall theme is ambition and prosperity."<ref name="hiphopdx1"/>

In a January 2014 interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', he announced that he would release the album before ''[[Street King Immortal]]'', saying: <blockquote>"There<U+2019>s an album I am putting out before ''Street King Immortal''. The title is called ''Animal Ambition''. It<U+2019>s an untamed desire to win. The record is overall about prosperity, ambition, and has an entrepreneurial energy<U+2014>it<U+2019>s all from a distorted perspective. I just been really excited about the concept, been writing and had a lot of time to create material for the release because it<U+2019>s taken so long. So when you listen the record, you<U+2019>ll see it because I told you it, it<U+2019>s about ambition. If I didn<U+2019>t say that, you wouldn<U+2019>t listen to the record and say what<U+2019>s that song called? Cause when Biggie was saying, "Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper," that<U+2019>s writing prosperity, but the effects of it from others. Jealousy is created from you moving forward. I wrote it from a lot of different angles in order to create an album with all the facets I was comfortable with so it could all have one thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/tech/2014/01/ces-2014-50-cent-sms-audio-g-unit |title=50 Cent Talks New SMS Lineup, Google Glass Fears, and G-Unit Reunions |publisher=Complex |date=2014-01-11 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref></blockquote> On February 20, 2014, 50 Cent left [[Shady Records]], [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]], after a 12-year union and subsequently signed himself and [[G-Unit Records]] to [[Caroline Records]] an independent distributor of [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tardio |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.27591/title.50-cent-leaves-shady-records-aftermath-entertainment-interscope-records- |title=50 Cent Leaves Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment & Interscope Records |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2014-02-16 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> On the same day, he announced that the album would be released on June 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tardio |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.27593/title.50-cent-animal-ambition-release-date/ |title=50 Cent Animal Ambition Release Date |publisher=HipHop DX |date= |accessdate=2014-02-20}}</ref> In a February 2014, interview with ''[[Forbes]]'' detailing his departure from Interscope 50 stated, "I<U+2019>m a special case and situation. It<U+2019>s also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don<U+2019>t want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2014/02/21/50-cent-explains-how-he-left-interscope-debuts-funeral-video/ |title=50 Cent Explains How He Left Interscope, Debuts 'Funeral' Video |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref>

==Release and promotion==
In a May 2014, interview with the [[Business News Network]], he spoke about the album's promotional campaign, saying: "I actually decided to create a campaign for the actual record that can sustain the audience. Because it has to sustain your interest for one week until the next song comes, until the next song comes, until the next song comes. And the actual visuals match the song so if you weren<U+2019>t impressed by the music you<U+2019>ll understand creatively why it<U+2019>s the way it is when you see the images. It<U+2019>s obviously a more complex presentation because you have to be really premeditated. You have to know what each one of your songs are gonna feel like. We only needed to know what three looked like. With three records because we<U+2019>re only shooting three music videos before you sold millions of records. The adjustments are technology."<ref>{{cite web|last=Balfour |first=Jay |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28712/title.50-cent-details-23-million-interscope-records-payout/ |title=50 Cent Details $23 Million Interscope Records Payout |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref> In June 2014, 50 announced that he would be accepting [[Bitcoin]] payments for the album, making him one of the biggest artists to use the cyptocurrency to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-50-cent-bitcoin-20140603-story.html |title=Rapper 50 Cent accepting bitcoin as payment for new album |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2014-06-05 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref>

Upon its release, ''Animal Ambition'' was met with generally mixed reviews. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 53, which indicates "mixed or average reviews", based on 15 reviews.<ref name="metacritic1"/> Killian Fox of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote "unchanged are his limitations as a rapper, both technically and in his choice of subjects." Also adding, "The theme here, we are told, is prosperity and its discontents, but he doesn't do much more than flaunt it and berate people for hating his success."<ref name="theguardian1"/> Sheldon Pearce of [[HipHopDX]] said, "This release was essentially pitched as a concept album on how wealth alters perception and inspires envy, and though it's possible to follow this loose narrative, the execution of this idea is thoroughly botched. In truth, this wouldn<U+2019>t be so difficult to stomach if he wasn<U+2019>t still rapping (both lyrically and contextually) like it<U+2019>s 2004. ''Animal Ambition'' is a drastically underperformed gut punch marred by its own limitations and its obsessive portrayal of self-worth amid a recitation of ''Get Rich or Die Tryin<U+2019>'' buzzwords."<ref name="hiphopdx2"/> David Jeffries of [[AllMusic]] said, "Consider it the album before the album, and it plays out as interesting and often awesome, but put this next to his major works and it seems a bit off and quirky."<ref name="allmusic1"/> Simon Vozick-Levinson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote "Tracks like "Hold On" and "Pilot" have all the smirking charm of 50's glory days. At their best, they can even recall his time as a mixtape hustler with a world to conquer and nothing to lose."<ref name="rollingstone1"/> 

Jabbari Weekes of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' wrote "''Animal Ambition'' showcases a very creatively confused 50 Cent, trapped in some sort of musical purgatory we can only hope he find his way out of."<ref name="exclaim1"/> Brandon Soderberg of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "''Animal Ambition'' half-assedly pimps the phony idea perpetuated by his Jesse Pinkman-like core fans and an increasingly clueless 50 Cent himself: that his success was built on bona fide gangster rap swagger rather than incredibly accessible club bangers."<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Ian Cohen of [[Pitchfork Media]] said, "There may not be much Curtis Jackson on ''Animal Ambition'', but it does give an accurate survey of where 50 Cent is at right now."<ref name="pitchfork1"/> Eric Diep of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' said, "50 Cent<U+2019>s credibility as a viable solo artist is still being tested every day. In a rare occasion for Fif, ''Animal Ambition'' has got everyone back on the 50 bandwagon and rooting for the second wind in his career. Now, with talks of a G-Unit album later this year, 50 Cent is on the fast-track to becoming the unstoppable force he once was. All of this only means 50 has to push even harder to elevate his status to that level, and with ''Animal Ambition'', he shows he<U+2019>s ready to put in the work."<ref name="xxl"/> Jordan Sowunmi of ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' said, "The album has a few bright spots: on Irregular Heartbeat, the emcee snarls the stone-faced threats that made him an irresistible menace in the early aughts. But it<U+2019>s not enough to save an album that<U+2019>s bogged down by a rapper <U+2013> and production <U+2013> stuck in the middle of the last decade."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sowunmi |first=Jordan |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=198415 |title=50 Cent: Animal Ambition |publisher=Nowtoronto.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref> Jesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] wrote "It's unfortunate that 50 Cent can't offer more, tackling his anxieties head-on rather than burying them under the guise of shopworn gangster narratives, but while simple pleasures are about all ''Animal Ambition'' can offer, it at least presents them with listenable panache."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/50-cent-animal-ambition-an-untamed-desire-to-win |title=50 Cent: Animal Ambition: An Untamed Desire to Win |publisher=Slant Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>
