'''The Oliver Typewriter Company''' was a manufacturer of [[typewriter|typewriters]] headquartered in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]].  The Oliver Typewriter was the first "visible print" typewriter, meaning text was visible to the typist as it was entered.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.boulderclassifieds.com/aboutus/history.html |title = Looking into our Past |author = Taylor, Carol  | date = November 1999 | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  Oliver typewriters were also the first to be successfully marketed for home use,<ref name="mus">{{cite web |url = http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=oliver3&cat=kd |title = The Virtual Typewriter Museum: Oliver 3 |accessdate= 2007-11-11 |language = English}}</ref> with more than one&nbsp;million typewriters produced by the late 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.officemuseum.com/typewriters_office_models.htm |title = Early Office Museum <U+2013> Office Typewriters |accessdate= 2007-11-11 |language = English}}</ref>  Financial troubles resulted in the company's liquidation, and in 1928 its assets were bought by The British Oliver Typewriter Company, which itself closed in the late 1950s.

The last Oliver typewriter was produced in 1959.

==History==
[[Image:Thomas Oliver.jpg|thumb|255px|right|Thomas Oliver]]
===Thomas Oliver===
Thomas Oliver was born in [[Woodstock, Ontario]], [[Canada]] on [[August 1]] [[1852]].  Having become interested in religion, Oliver moved to [[Monticello, Iowa| Monticello]], [[Iowa]] after the death of his mother, to serve as a [[Methodist]] minister.  During that time Oliver designed and developed his first typewriter, made from strips of [[tin can|tin cans]], as a means of producing more legible [[sermon|sermons]].<ref name="etc">{{cite web |url = http://etceterarehr1.googlepages.com/ETC.06.pdf |title = The Unknown Oliver | author = Rehr, Darryl | publisher= ETCetera &ndash; Magazine of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association |date = February 1989 | pages = 1,4-5 |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate= 2007-11-11 |language = English}}</ref> He was awarded his first typewriter [[patent]], US Patent No. 450,107, on [[April 7]] [[1891]].  Oliver resigned his ministry and moved to [[Epworth, Iowa]], where he found investors willing to provide $15,000 of capital, and leased a building in which to manufacture his machines.

While visiting Chicago to promote the machine, Oliver encountered a businessman named Delavan Smith, who became interested in the typewriter and bought the majority of the company<U+2019>s [[stock]] from the Iowa investors.  Oliver retained a 65% interest in the company and continued to develop the typewriter, at an annual salary of $3,000.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://etceterarehr1.googlepages.com/ETC.07.pdf |title= More on Reverend Oliver ... | author = Rehr, Darryl |publisher= ETCetera &ndash; Magazine of the Early Typewriter Collectors Association |date= May 1989 |pages = 8-9 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |language = English}}</ref> Oliver died suddenly of "[[heart disease]]" on [[February 9]] [[1909]], aged 56.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9B02E1D91031E733A25753C1A9649C946897D6CF |title=Thomas Oliver |publisher=The New York Times |date=[[February 10]] [[1909]] |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-11-11 |language = English}}</ref>

===The Oliver Typewriter Company===
The Oliver Typewriter Company began operating in 1895, with its headquarters on the ninth floor of a building on the corner of Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago.  Manufacturing moved from Iowa to [[Woodstock, Illinois]] in 1896, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver Typewriter Company remained there for five years.<ref>{{cite book| last = Baker | first = Nancy L. | title = Woodstock | publisher = Arcadia Publishing | date = 2006 | pages = 33 | isbn = 0738540803 |language = English}}</ref>  Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, carriage, assembly, tabulators and adjustment, inspection and an aligning room.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v018/p0119-p0128.pdf |title = Product Design and Cost Considerations: Clock, Watch, and Typewriter Manufacturing in the 19th Century |author = Hoke, Donald |format=[[PDF]]|accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  Company headquarters moved to [[Oliver Building (Chicago)|the Oliver Building]], now a Chicago landmark on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], when it was completed in 1907.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/O/OliverBuilding.html |title=Chicago Landmarks |publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division |accessdate=2007-12-20 |language = English}}</ref>

The Oliver was the first typewriter to achieve relatively successful home sales.<ref name="mus"/>  Starting in 1899, the company encouraged customers to become distributors by selling directly to neighbors.  Marketing relied on word of mouth, which emphasized "direct sales" (door to door) and, after 1905, sales on [[credit]]. In response to increased competition in the late 1910s, however, the company eliminated its network of local salesman and used the resulting savings in [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to reduce the typewriter's $100 price by half.<ref name="etc21"/>  Sales increased and, at its peak, the company's labor force of 875 was producing 375 machines daily.<ref name="etc"/>

In addition to its offices in Illinois, the company had branch offices in Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, Omaha, St. Louis, San Francisco and Seattle, all of which closed when Oliver shifted to [[mail order]] sales in March 1917.  A minor [[recession]] in 1921&ndash;1922 caused a large number customers to default on their payments, resulting in the [[repossession]] of their typewriters.  The company opted not to borrow money, and in 1926 the [[board of directors]] voted to liquidate the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.<ref name="SLJ">{{cite web |url = http://homepage.mac.com/sljohnson/typewriter/oliver/oliver-history-a.html |title = The History of The Oliver Typewriter Co. |author = Johnson, Shannon  | date = [[January 11]], [[2003]] | accessdate= 2007-12-19|language = English}}</ref>

===The British Oliver Typewriter Company===
In 1928, the Oliver Typewriter Company was sold to the British Oliver Typewriter Company of [[Croydon]], [[England]].<ref name="omm">{{cite web |url = http://homepage.mac.com/sljohnson/typewriter/oliver/oliver-serials.html |title = Construction & Models Manufactured |author = Johnson, Shannon | date = [[November 25]], [[2002]] | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  All Oliver typewriters produced in England during [[World War II]] went to the British government to assist the [[Allies of World War II|war effort]]; none were available for private ownership.<ref name="anglo">{{cite web |url = http://www.goldiproductions.com/BoerWar_Museum/Boer92l_pastdis_oliver.html |title = The Canadian Anglo-Boer War Museum - The Oliver Typewriter | date = August 2005 | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  After the war, The British Oliver Typewriter Company licensed manufacturing to other European companies, including companies based in [[Austria]] and [[Italy]].  Production of all Oliver typewriters ended in May 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.geocities.com/wbd641/oliver.html |title = Oliver portables and relatives | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>

==Typewriters==
[[Image:Oliver Typewriter No. 5.JPG|thumb|255px|right|Oliver model No.5]]
===Design===
The general design of Oliver typewriters remained mostly unchanged throughout the company's history.<ref name="SLJ"/> The Olivers are "down strike" typewriters, meaning the [[typebar]]s strike the [[platen]] from above, rather than from below ("up strike"), or from the front ("front strike").  Unlike the "up strike" method, which prints text out of sight on the underside of the platen, the "down strike" is a "visible print" design, meaning the full page is visible to the typist as the text is being entered.  The "front strike" method, also a "visible print" design, was patented at around the same time (1889&ndash;91), but an effective machine that did not interfere with the typist<U+2019>s line of sight was not available until 1897, when the [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood No. 1]] appeared on the market, about three years after the introduction of the Oliver No. 1.<ref name="Rutherford">{{cite web |url = http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article010105.html |title = The User-friendly Typewriter |author = Campbell-Kelly, Martin | publisher = The Rutherford Journal | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>

The Oliver<U+2019>s typebars are bent in a bow (forming an inverted "U" shape) and rest in "towers" on the sides of the typewriter. The resulting, distinctive shape spawned the nickname "iron [[butterfly]]".<ref name="anglo"/><ref name="noe">{{cite web |url = http://home.earthlink.net/~dcrehr/oliver.html |title = Oliver Typewriter - Oliver 11, 1923 | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  This design limited the machine to a three-row [[keyboard]], as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added.  The size and usability implications of adding additional keys, and thus more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to [[numbers]].<ref name="Rutherford"/>  Although a four-row [[prototype]] was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company<U+2019>s financial troubles at that time.<ref name="etc"/>  Customer preference for four-row keyboards, and the relatively greater striking power of the "down strike" design, led the American Oliver to be "marginalized"<ref name="mus"/> for use as a [[stencil]] maker or "[[manifold]]er".  From 1931 onwards, the British Oliver Typewriter Company produced machines with four-row keyboards.<ref name="SLJ" />

===Color===
Oliver typewriters were finished with olive green paint or [[nickel]]-plating and white or black [[alphanumeric keyboard|keyboards]], depending on customer preference.  Beginning with model No. 3, all machines were painted green except those to be exported to warm or damp regions, which continued to be nickel-plated.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/index.php3?machine=oliver3n&cat=kd |title = The Virtual Typewriter Museum <U+2013> Oliver 3 Nickel Base | accessdate= 2007-11-11|language = English}}</ref>  The color was changed from green to black on the introduction of model No.&nbsp;11.<ref name="noe"/>
