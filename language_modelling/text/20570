'''''The King's Speech''''' is a 2010 British [[historical drama]] film directed by [[Tom Hooper (director)|Tom Hooper]] and written by [[David Seidler]]. The film won the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] [[Toronto International Film Festival#People's Choice Award|People's Choice Award]] and has been nominated for [[List of accolades received by The King's Speech|twelve Academy Awards]], [[List of accolades received by The King's Speech|fourteen BAFTA awards]] and was nominated for [[List of accolades received by The King's Speech|seven Golden Globes]].

Colin Firth won a Golden Globe for his lead role as [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], who, to overcome his [[stuttering|stammer]], goes to [[Lionel Logue]], an unorthodox [[speech therapy|speech therapist]] played by [[Geoffrey Rush]]. The two men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates, the King relies on Logue to help him make a radio broadcast at the beginning of the [[Second World War]].

David Seidler began reading about George VI after overcoming his own stutter during his youth and, using informed imagination, wrote about the men's relationship. Nine weeks before filming, Logue's notebooks were discovered and quotations from them incorporated into the script. Principal photography took place in London, and other locations in the United Kingdom, in December 2009 and early January 2010. The film was released in the United States on 10 December 2010 and in the UK on 7 January 2011. It was initially classified with a "15" rating in the UK, due to strong language; this was downgraded after criticism.

''The King's Speech'' was the highest earning film for three weekends in a row at the UK box office, and has earned over <U+00A3>100 million in cinemas to date.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=kingsspeech.htm|title=The King's Speech|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=9 February 2011}} (Dollar to pound sterling conversion done with with Google's currency converter)</ref> The film has been widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of the historical events it portrays, in particular the reversal of [[Winston Churchill]]'s opposition to abdication.

== Plot summary ==
The film opens with [[George VI of the United Kingdom|The Prince Albert, Duke of York]] (played by [[Colin Firth]]), the second son of [[King George V]], speaking at the close of the 1925 [[British Empire Exhibition|Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], with his wife [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) by his side. <ref>London Academy of Media Film & TV [http://www.media-courses.com/blog/the-kings-speech-movie-2010/ "The King's Speech"]</ref> His stammering speech visibly unsettles the thousands of listeners in the audience. The prince tries several unsuccessful treatments and gives up, until the Duchess persuades him to see [[Lionel Logue]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), an Australian speech therapist in London. In their first session, Logue requests that they address each other by their Christian names, a breach of royal etiquette. He convinces Albert to read [[Hamlet|Hamlet's]] "[[To be, or not to be]]" [[soliloquy]], while listening to the overture from Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' on headphones. Logue records Albert's reading, but convinced that he has stammered throughout, Albert leaves in a huff. Logue offers him the recording as a keepsake.

As King George V ([[Michael Gambon]]) makes his 1934 Christmas address, he explains the importance of broadcasting to the modern monarchy to his son. Later, Albert plays Logue's recording and hears an unbroken recitation of Shakespeare in his own voice. He returns to Logue, and they work together on muscle relaxation and breath control, while simultaneously probing the psychological roots of his stammer. The Prince reveals some of the pressures of his childhood: his strict father; the repression of his natural [[Left-handedness#Social stigma and repression|left-handedness]]; a painful treatment with metal splints for his [[knock-kneed|knock-knees]];  and a nanny who favoured his elder brother, deliberately pinching Albert at the daily presentations to their parents. As the treatment progresses, the two become friends and confidants.
[[File:Filming Colin and Helena.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and woman standing side by side|Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter as the Duke and Duchess of York]]
When George V dies, the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne as [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]] ([[Guy Pearce]]), but he wants to marry [[Wallis Simpson]] ([[Eve Best]]), an American divorc<U+00E9>e socialite, which would provoke a constitutional crisis.  At Christmas in [[Balmoral Castle]], Albert points out that Edward cannot marry a divorced woman and [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|retain the throne]], Edward angrily accuses his brother of a medieval-style plot to [[usurp]] his throne, citing Albert's speech lessons as an attempt to ready himself for power. Albert is tongue-tied at the accusation, and Edward resurrects his childhood taunt of "B-B-Bertie". At his next session, the Prince has not forgotten the incident. In an attempt to console him, Logue insists that Albert could be king and says the shilling of their wager should bear the Duke's head as monarch. Albert accuses Logue of treason and, in a temper, he  mocks Logue's failed acting career and humble origins, causing a rift in their friendship.

When King Edward abdicates to marry, Albert becomes King George VI.  He needs Logue's help and he and the Queen visit the Logues' residence to apologise.  When the King insists that Logue be seated in the king's box during his coronation in [[Westminster Abbey]], Dr [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] ([[Derek Jacobi]]), questions Logue's qualifications. This prompts another confrontation between the King and Logue, who explains he began by treating shell-shocked soldiers in [[World War I]]. When Logue sits in [[St Edward's Chair]] and dismisses the [[Stone of Scone]] as a trifle, the King's clear remonstration of Logue's disrespect for the relics leads him to realise that he is as capable as those before him.

Upon the 1939 [[declaration of war]] with Germany, George VI summons Logue to [[Buckingham Palace]] to prepare for his radio speech to the country. As the King and Logue move through the palace to a tiny studio, [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Timothy Spall]]) reveals to the King that he too had once had a speech impediment but had found a way to use it to his advantage. The King delivers his speech as if to Logue, who coaches him through every moment.  But this scene moves beyond coaching to generate an understanding of the essential dynamic of successful public performance: in order to perform comfortably, the artist must maintain a connection to the audience.  When Lionel says, "Speak to me," he is giving a lesson to all of us.  If you can feel safe with your audience, if you can befriend them, then no matter what happens, you will be fine.  The many pauses necessitated to prevent his stammer therefore sound convincingly dramatic, and the speech is a success. As Logue watches, the King steps onto the balcony of the palace with his family, where thousands of people assembled for the speech applaud him.

A final [[title card]] explains that, during the many speeches King George VI gave during [[World War II]], Logue was always present. Later, he was inducted into the [[Royal Victorian Order]] for his service to the King, with whom he remained friends.

[[David Seidler]], the writer, had himself developed a stammer as a child, due, he believes, to the emotional trauma of the war, which had included the murder of his grandparents during [[the Holocaust]]. As a child, Seidler was inspired on finding out that King George VI had overcome a stutter. <U+201C>Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so with passion and intensity,<U+201D> Seidler recalled. When Seidler became a writer as an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late seventies and eighties he voraciously researched the King, but a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually, Seidler contacted Dr Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available, if The Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to in her lifetime and Seidler abandoned the project.<ref>Logue's role in helping Prince Albert (later [[King George VI]] overcome his speech impediment was known, as it is discussed in Alan Michie's "God Save The Queen," published in 1952, after the death of [[King George VI]] and prior to the [[coronation]] of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}</ref> [[File:GeoffreyRush08TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A middle aged man's face, reddish, curly gray hair.

His research, including a chance encounter with an uncle whom Logue treated, indicated he used mechanical breathing exercises combined with therapy probing the underlying causes of the condition. Thus prepared, Seidler imagined the sessions. He showed the finished screenplay to his wife. She liked it, but pronounced it too "seduced by cinematic technique" and suggested he re-write it as a stageplay to focus on the essential relationship between the King and Logue. After he had completed it, he decided he quite liked it and sent it to a few people for feedback.<ref name='Seidler'>Seidler, D.

In early 2006, one of the people Seidler sent his play passed it to Joan Lane, of Wilde Thyme, a production company in London. Lane saw the script as a potential screen drama as well as stage play, and showed it to Simon Egan of Bedlam Productions, who recorded the first rehearsed read-through. Together Lane and Bedlam organised a reading of the play in Pleasance theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother, who called her son immediately and said "I've found your next project".<ref name='Gritten'>Gritten, D.

The set design presented a challenge for the film-makers, since as a period drama, the film relied to an extent on the quality of its production, but the budget was a relatively limited <U+00A3>10 million. At the same time, the film had to be authentic, combining regal opulence and scruffy, depression-era London.<ref name='Sets'/> On 25 November 2009, Rush and [[Derek Jacobi]] took part in filming at the [[Pullens buildings]] in Southwark.<ref name="Greenwood100">{{cite web|author= Greenwood100|date= November 2009|url= http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenwood100/sets/72157622887893230/ | title=The King's Speech | publisher=Flickr }}</ref> On 26 November, a week's filming with Firth, Rush and Jacobi began at [[Ely Cathedral]], the location used for [[Westminster Abbey]].

=== Visual style ===
Hooper employs a number of cinematic techniques to evoke the King's feelings of constriction. [[Manohla Dargis]] thought the feeling of entrapment inside the King's head was rendered overly literal with a [[fisheye lens]], though Hooper denied this, saying he had simply used wider than normal lenses photographing the film.<ref name='Dargis'/><ref name='Appleo'> Appleo, T. [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/race/5-secrets-kings-speech-dga-94729 The 5 Secrets of Tom Hooper<U+2019>s <U+2018>King<U+2019>s Speech<U+2019> Success] ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', 31 January 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2011</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] noted that the majority of the film is shot inside, where oblong sets, corridors and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in [[List of historical drama films|historical dramas]].<ref name='Ebert'/> Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly [[Geoffrey Rush]] who trained at the [[L'<U+00C9>cole Internationale de Th<U+00E9><U+00E2>tre Jacques Lecoq]] in Paris and "is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is framed against a large wall squeezed against the end of a long couch, "if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?".<ref name='Appleo'/> Martin Filler praised the "low-wattage" [[cinematography]] of Danny Cohen, as making everything look like it has been "steeped in strong tea".<ref name='Filler'>Filler, M.

=== Music ===
The film's score was composed by [[Alexandre Desplat]]. In a film about a man struggling to articulate himself, Desplat was wary of overshadowing the dramaturgy. He characterised the challenge: <U+201C>This is a film about the sound of the voice. Music has to deal with that. Music has to deal with silence. Music has to deal with time.<U+201D><ref name='Martens'> Martens, T.[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/11/the-sound-of-silence-alexandre-desplat-on-the-music-that-just-floats-throughout-the-kings-speech.html The sound of silence: Alexandre Desplat on the music that 'just floats' throughout 'The King's Speech' ] ''Pop & hiss'', LA Times music blog. wwww.latimesblogs.latimes.com/musicblog 26 November 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2011</ref> 
The score is a sparse arrangement of strings and piano, intended to convey the sadness of the King's muteness, and then growing warmth of friendship between him and Logue. The minimalist approach emphasises the protagonist<U+2019>s struggle for control in the story.<ref name='McNab'>McNab, K.[http://www.soundonsight.org/the-king%E2%80%99s-speech-score-review/ The King's Speech score review] www.soundonsight.org, 27 January 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2011</ref> Desplat used the repetition of a single note to represent the stickiness of the King's speech.<ref name='Martens'/> As the film progresses growing banks of warm strings swaddle the deepening friendship between the two leads, to a climax in the coronation scene. Hooper originally wanted to film the scene without music, though Desplat argued that it was the real climax of the story, the point when the friendship was ratified by their decision to trust each other. "That is really rare", said Desplat, "Mostly you have love stories".<ref name='Martens'/> To create a period sound the score was recorded on microphones which had been specially made for the royal family, extracted from the EMI archives.<ref name='Martens'/> The score was nominated for several awards including "Best Original Score" at the Oscars, Golden Globes and BAFTAs.

== Historical accuracy ==
According to screenwriter David Seidler, director Tom Hooper insisted on being as historically accurate as possible, the two of them working together for four months to get the best from the script, and ensure its authenticity.<ref name = "seidler">http://creativescreenwritingmagazine.blogspot.com Interview with David Seidler</ref> According to a BBC interview with Lionel Logue's grandson, the film team became aware of a diary containing Logue's original notes on his treatment of the duke only some nine weeks prior to shooting.<ref>BBC: "Finding the real King's Speech" (interview with Logue's grandson), 4 January 2011.  Accessed on 8 Jan 2011 at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12116320.</ref> They then went back and re-worked the script to reflect what was in the notes.<ref name = "seidler"/>  Hooper said that some of the film's most memorable lines were direct quotes from Logue's notes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cutprintreview.com/interviews/interview-the-kings-speech-director-tom-hooper/|title=Interview: THE KING<U+2019>S SPEECH director Tom Hooper|publisher=Cut Print Review|first=Anders|last=Wotzke|date=12 December 2010}}</ref>

However certain changes were made for [[artistic license|artistic or dramatic reasons]]. Professor Cathy Schultz pointed out that the film-makers tightened the chronology of the events to just a few years. The Duke of York in fact began to work with Lionel Logue in October 1926, ten years before the [[abdication crisis]].<ref>{{cite web| last=Schultz |first=Cathy |title=History in the Movies |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=4 January 2011 |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110104/NEWS0107/101040314/1020&nav_category=}}</ref> The improvement in speech was apparent in months rather than years as suggested by the film. In a 1952 newspaper interview with [[John Gordon (journalist)|John Gordon]], Logue said that "Resonantly and without stuttering, he opened the Australian Parliament in Canberra in 1927"; i.e. just seven months after the Duke began to work with Logue.<ref>{{cite news|title=He Came To London Unknown - And Gave The King The Power To Speak|last=Gordon|first=John|publisher=''[[Daily Express]]''|date=7 February 1952}}</ref> Hugo Vickers, a royal adviser, agreed that altering historical details to preserve the essence of the dramatic story was sometimes necessary. The high ranking officials, for instance, would not have been present when the King made his speech, nor would Churchill have even been involved at any level, "but the average viewer knows who Churchill is; he doesn't know who [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] and Lord Hoare [sc.

[[Martin Filler]] agreed that smaller liberties were mostly justified artistic licence, indeed, the probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting makes a valid point. George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing casually, nor swearing, he probably understood German and in reality was lukewarm towards Churchill until later in the war because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis.<ref name='Filler'/>

The film was initially given a 15 rating by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] for its release in the United Kingdom, due to scenes where Logue encourages the King to shout profanities to relieve stress. At the London Film Festival, Hooper criticised the decision, questioning how the body could certify the film "15" for bad language but allow films such as ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010) and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) to have 12A ratings despite their graphic torture scenes.
