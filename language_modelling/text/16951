From October 1988 to September 1994 the voices of representatives from [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] and several [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitary]] groups were banned by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by [[Home Secretary]] [[Douglas Hurd]] on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in [[Northern Ireland]] and followed a heightened period of violence in the history of [[the Troubles]], as well as the government's belief in a need to prevent Sinn F<U+00E9>in from using the media for political advantage.

Broadcasters quickly found ways around the ban, chiefly by using actors to repeat the words of anyone who was prevented from speaking directly. The legislation did not apply during election campaigns, and under certain other circumstances. The restrictions caused difficulties for British journalists who objected to censorship in various other countries, such as Iraq and India. Ireland had [[Censorship in Ireland#The Troubles|its own similar legislation]] that banned anyone with links to paramilitary groups from the airwaves, but repealed this in January 1994. This added pressure on the British government to do likewise. The broadcast ban was finally lifted on 16 September 1994, a fortnight after the first [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] ceasefire.

==Background==

Throughout the Troubles, UK broadcasters were regularly required to stop or postpone the broadcast of documentaries and other programmes relating to [[Ireland]].<ref name=Moloney/> One of the most prominent instances of this was the 1985 ''Real Lives'' documentary for the [[BBC]], ''At the Edge of the Union''. The programme featured extensive footage of Sinn F<U+00E9>in's [[Martin McGuinness]] and the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]'s [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]] discussing the Troubles, and following direct intervention by the government it was temporarily blocked from being aired. The incident led to a one day strike by members of the [[National Union of Journalists]], who walked out in protest that the BBC's independence was being undermined.<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/>
[[File:Springhill 1984.jpg|right|thumb|225x225px|A republican anti-censorship [[Murals in Northern Ireland|mural]] in Belfast]]
The months leading up to the introduction of the ban had also seen a particularly intense period of Troubles-related violence.<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/> One of the bloodiest episodes of that time was the [[Ballygawley bus bombing]] which resulted in the deaths of several British soldiers.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19>{{cite news|first= Owen|last= Bowcott|title= 50 MPs sign petition against year-old ban on broadcast interviews with Sinn Fein|publisher= Guardian Media Group|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 19 October 1989}}</ref> Another incident, the [[Corporals killings|killing of two off-duty British soldiers]] who stumbled into an IRA funeral procession, brought the media into conflict with the government after journalists present at the funeral declined a [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] request to hand over footage of the incident amid concerns doing so would put them at risk.<ref name=Moloney/> In response [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] told the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] journalists had a "bounden duty" to assist with the investigation. "Either one is on the side of justice in these matters or one is on the side of terrorism".<ref name=Moloney/> Film was subsequently seized from the BBC and [[ITN]] under the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism]] and [[Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973|Emergency Provisions]] Acts.<ref name=Moloney/>

The [[Third Thatcher ministry|Conservative government]] believed there was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn F<U+00E9>in from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA,<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/> and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the [[right to silence]] and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners [[clemency|early release]].<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/01/world/civil-liberties-in-britain-are-they-under-siege.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Civil Liberties in Britain: Are They Under Siege? |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=1 November 1988 |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme, ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' which was to have featured Sinn F<U+00E9>in president [[Gerry Adams]] as a guest.<ref name=Moloney/><ref name=Irish-Times-1994-09-17>{{cite news|title= Dubbing SF voices becomes the stuff of history|first= Michael|last= Foley|publisher= The Irish Times Trust|newspaper= The Irish Times|date= 17 September 1994|page= 5}}</ref> The show was dropped after the conservative academic [[Paul Wilkinson (academic)|Paul Wilkinson]] <U+2013> a Professor at [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]] who specialised in the study of terrorism <U+2013> voiced strong objections to its transmission.<ref name=Moloney/>

[[File:Douglas Hurd, November 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Douglas Hurd, seen here in 2007, introduced the measures in October 1988.]]

On 19 October 1988, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd issued a notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the [[Broadcasting Act 1981]] to the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] prohibiting the broadcast of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish political and military organisations.<ref name="glasgow48">{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=48|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&pg=PA48}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Political Debate and the Role of the Media: The Fragility of Free Speech|at=p 91 footnote 14|publisher=[[European Audiovisual Observatory]]|isbn=978-92-871-5675-4|year=2004|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vPXw-8wmitQC&pg=PA91}}</ref> The ban prevented the UK news media from broadcasting the voices, though not the words, of ten Irish republican and Loyalist paramilitaries, as well as Sinn F<U+00E9>in.<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/><ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/> Among the other groups affected were the IRA, [[Irish National Liberation Army]], [[Ulster Defence Association]] and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], although the ban was targeted primarily at Sinn F<U+00E9>in.<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05>{{cite news|title=The 'broadcast ban' on Sinn Fein|publisher=BBC News|first=Francis|last=Welch|date=5 April 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4409447.stm|accessdate= 21 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17>{{cite news|first=Rhys |last=Williams |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/broadcasters-welcome-end-to-censorship-1449238.html |title=Broadcasters welcome end to 'censorship' |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 September1994 |accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> Addressing the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]] on the ban, Hurd said, "the terrorists themselves draw support and sustenance from access to radio and television...the time has come to deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism",<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/><ref>{{cite news|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/oct/19/broadcasting-and-terrorism|title= Broadcasting and Terrorism|publisher= |work= Hansard vol 138 cc893-903|date= 19 October 1988|accessdate= 3 July 2013}}</ref> while the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said it would "deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity".<ref name=Irish-Times-1994-09-17/>

Hurd's belief was that the ban would place the print and broadcast media on a level footing, but opponents of the restrictions argued they were affecting the quality of news reporting from Northern Ireland, and subsequently people's understanding of the issues.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/><ref name=Herald-1989-05-27/> The broadcaster Scarlett McGwire, one of those to challenge the regulations, said in 1989, "The case is not just about journalists and being able to report Northern Ireland properly. It is about people not being able to understand what is happening there because it is not reported properly".<ref name=Herald-1989-05-27>{{cite news|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kDNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RlkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3165,2070278&dq=broadcast+ban+northern+ireland&hl=en|title= Journalists lose bid to stop broadcasting curbs|newspaper= The Glasgow Herald|publisher= Newsquest|date= 27 May 1989|accessdate= 30 June 2013|page= 5}}</ref> [[Marmaduke Hussey]], Chairman of the BBC, called the ban a "very dangerous precedent".<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/> A petition organised by the [[Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom]], and including the signatures of 50 MPs, was presented at [[10 Downing Street]] on the first anniversary of its commencement.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/>

==Implementation==

Media outlets were largely required to interpret the restrictions in their own way, and the ban's remit was at first applied retrospectively to archive material, though this was later relaxed following government advice.<ref name=Moloney/>{{efn|"Channel 4 took the ban two stages further, however. It would, its lawyers said, cover 'works of fiction, whatever their provenance or theme' and the ban was also to be as retrospective as the historical development of technology allowed."<ref name=Moloney/>}} In 2005 [[John Birt, Baron Birt|John Birt]], a former [[Director-General of the BBC]] said Hurd's announcement came "right out of the blue", while [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]], who in 1988 was director of publicity for Sinn F<U+00E9>in spoke of the total confusion that resulted. "I asked television and radio journalists, 'what can be done?'"<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/> Subtitling was initially used, but one of the main ways the new law was circumvented was by substituting the voices of actors for those who could not speak directly.<ref name=Irish-Times-1993-11-03/> The BBC and its commercial counterparts compiled a list of actors who could be called upon to record voiceovers for news items and documentaries about the Troubles, often at short notice.<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/> The actors frequently spoke the words in real time along with the person whose voice was being dubbed. One such interview with Gerry Adams once appeared on the US [[CNN]] network without anyone realising they were hearing an actor speak.<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/>

The restrictions were also applied to television drama, documentary and discussion programmes. In December 1988 [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Tom King, Baron King of Bridgwater|Tom King]] ordered Channel 4 to cancel an episode of the US drama series ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'' that featured the story of a fictional IRA [[Arms trafficking|gunrunner]], even though it had aired previously.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/> ''Mother Ireland'', a documentary about woman and [[Irish nationalism]] that included an interview with [[Mair<U+00E9>ad Farrell]], shot dead during an [[Operation Flavius|SAS operation]] in [[Gibraltar]], was also banned.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/> On a later occasion the appearance of political activist [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey]] on an edition of the BBC's ''Nation'' discussing reasons for political violence was also censored when much of what she said was subtitled.<ref name=Independent-1993-10-13/>

On radio an interview with [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Guildford Four]] campaigner Errol Smalley was dropped by [[Surrey]]-based [[County Sound Radio (1566 AM)|County Sound]], though he made a later appearance after successfully overturning the decision.<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/> In November 1988 ''[[Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six]]'' <U+2013> a song by [[The Pogues]] expressing support for the [[Birmingham Six]] and Guildford Four <U+2013> was subject to the regulations because it included "general disagreement with the way in which the British government responds to, and the courts deal with, the terrorist threat in the UK".<ref name=Guardian-1989-10-19/><ref name=Independent-1993-10-13>{{cite news|first=David |last=Miller |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-northern-ireland-a-story-stifled-david-miller-argues-that-the-fiveyearold-broadcasting-ban-has-failed-to-halt-terrorist-bombings-and-killings-instead-it-has-succeeded-in-hampering-sinn-fein-a-legal-politcal-party-1510377.html |title=Media: Northern Ireland: a story stifled: David Miller argues that the five-year-old broadcasting ban has failed to halt terrorist bombings and killings.

However, the ban was not always enforced. Restrictions were briefly lifted during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] allowing a political debate between Sinn F<U+00E9>in president [[Gerry Adams]] and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] leader [[John Hume]] to be heard during the election campaign, but the ban resumed once the polls were closed, even preventing Adams' reaction to the loss of his [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary seat]] from being directly aired.<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/> An individual's real voice could also be broadcast if the news item in question did not directly relate to their political beliefs or paramilitary activities. Similarly, anyone subject to the restrictions who was an eyewitness to an event or incident could be heard. In February 1992, Sinn F<U+00E9>in councillor Gerard McGuigan's voice was broadcast when he spoke about an attack on his house by the [[Ulster Freedom Fighters]].<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12>{{cite news|first=Tomy |last=Hall |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/a-gag-that-chokes-freedom-tony-hall-calls-for-the-lifting-of-the-broadcasting-ban-which-he-claims-the-ira-has-exploited-to-damage-britains-reputation-1448321.html |title=A gag that chokes freedom: Tony Hall calls for the lifting of the broadcasting ban which he claims the IRA has exploited to damage Britain's reputation |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=12 September 1994 |accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref> Adams was also allowed to speak about a similar attack against his property.<ref name=Irish-Times-1993-11-03/> On another occasion, the journalist [[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]] was given access to inmates at the [[HM Prison Maze|Maze Prison]] for a documentary about the jail, but while the prisoners were allowed to speak freely about their personal lives, a complaint by the IRA's food spokesman concerning the size of the prison's [[sausage roll]]s had to be revoiced.<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/> In 2005, television producer Francis Welch described the incident as one that highlighted "the surreal nature of the restrictions".<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/>

==Lifting of regulations==

[[File:John Major 1996.jpg|thumb|right|Former Prime Minister John Major lifted the restrictions in 1994.]]

Thatcher's successor as Prime Minister, [[John Major]] announced a review of the regulations in November 1993, telling the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]] that the general belief within the Conservative Party was that interviews with those subject to the restrictions were being stretched "to the limit and perhaps beyond".<ref name=Irish-Times-1994-09-17/><ref name=Irish-Times-1993-11-03>{{cite news|first=Rachel|last=Borrill|first2=Michael|last2=Foley|title= Major seeks review of ban on NI terror group interviews|newspaper= The Irish Times|publisher= The Irish Times Trust|date= 3 November 1993|page=6}}</ref> His decision followed a television interview with Gerry Adams, which Conservative MP [[Jill Knight]] described as having caused "offence to a great number of people".<ref name=Irish-Times-1993-11-03/><ref>{{cite news|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1993/nov/02/engagements#S6CV0231P0_19931102_HOC_105|title= Engagements|publisher= |work= Hansard vol 231 cc147-52|date= 2 November 1993|accessdate= 3 July 2013}}</ref> MPs from the Conservative [[Backbencher|backbench]] and [[Ulster unionism|Ulster Unionists]] wanted more rigid restrictions,<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/> and ''[[The Irish Times]]'' reported a "widespread feeling" that Major favoured a complete ban, but that journalists were opposed to this, quoting the BBC's [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]], who said that reporting events from Northern Ireland would become "virtually impossible".<ref name=Irish-Times-1993-11-03/> At that time coverage of Northern Ireland-related topics was becoming more frequent with the increasing pace of the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]].<ref name=Irish-Times-1994-09-17/> The review was conducted by [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Secretary of State for Heritage]] [[Peter Brooke]], but in February 1994 Major's government decided to maintain the status quo.<ref>{{cite news|first=Colin |last=Brown |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/sinn-fein-broadcast-ban-to-be-maintained-right-wing-urges-tougher-line-on-ira-1391989.html |title=Sinn Fein broadcast ban to be maintained: Right wing urges tougher line on IRA |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=5 February 1994 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

Pressure to reverse the restrictions grew after the [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]] repealed their own legislation that prohibited radio and television interviews with representatives of paramilitary groups and Sinn F<U+00E9>in in January 1994.<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/> From that point anyone in Northern Ireland with access to Ireland's state broadcaster, [[Raidi<U+00F3> Teilif<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]] could hear the voices of anyone still banned from the airwaves by the UK regulations. Responding to Ireland's decision, Gerry Adams said, "Over 20 years of political censorship has served to stunt any hopes of a resolution of the conflict. It has denied the right of information. Good riddance."<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/> The regulations particularly came under the spotlight during a 1994 visit Adams made to the United States, where he gave a speech that was widely broadcast around the world, but had to be dubbed in the UK because of the ban.<ref name=Irish-Times-1994-09-17/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1994/feb/03/engagements#S6CV0236P0_19940203_HOC_121|title= Engagements|publisher= |work= Hansard vol 236 cc1021-4|date= 3 February 1994|accessdate= 3 July 2013}}</ref> In May 1994 the National Union of Journalists launched a legal challenge with the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] seeking to take the British government to court for breach of freedom of expression under the [[European Convention of Human Rights]], but the case was rejected.

The decision to end the ban was welcomed by broadcasters. [[Michael Grade]], then Chief Executive of Channel 4 said it had ended "one of the most embarrassing attempts to censor coverage of the most important domestic political story of post-war years", while John Birt commented, "We can once again apply normal and testing scrutiny to all sides in the debate".<ref name=Independent2-1994-09-17/> Sinn F<U+00E9>in also signalled their approval, but the ban's lifting was viewed with more caution by unionist politicians. Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party felt the decision was premature while the IRA remained an armed organisation. "It gives de facto recognition to a body of men who still have their guns and bombs under the table, who still reserve the right to murder if they don't get their way".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19940917&id=YtROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BEsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7148,3411920|title= Britain ends IRA broadcast ban|newspaper= The Victoria Advocate|publisher= Victoria Advocate Publishing|date= 17 September 1994|accessdate= 26 June 2013|page= 5}}</ref>

==Analysis==

[[File:John Simpson.jpg|thumb|left|BBC Foreign Correspondent John Simpson encountered difficulties while reporting from Iraq because of the restrictions.]]

Francis Welch, the producer of ''Speak No Evil'', a 2005 BBC documentary that discusses the restrictions argued that the legislation "added pressure to the process of reporting events in Northern Ireland", while Sinn F<U+00E9>in's Danny Morrison believed the ban "was a weapon of war used by the government" in an attempt to silence the Republican movement. However, former Conservative MP [[Norman Tebbit]] said that the media was giving Sinn F<U+00E9>in and the IRA "publicity that they shouldn't have had". [[Peter Robinson (politician)|Peter Robinson]] of the Democratic Unionist Party argued the use of legislation was "a legitimate weapon for the state to use".<ref name=BBC-2005-04-05/>

In 1994 [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Tony Hall]], the head of the BBC's News and Current' Affairs argued that the restrictions did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the September 1993 appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's ''[[On the Record (BBC TV series)|On the Record]]'' in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as presenter [[Sheena McDonald]] argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries.<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/> Additionally Hall argued that Sinn F<U+00E9>in and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/>

The BBC Foreign Affairs Editor [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] encountered similar difficulties on the issue of censorship while reporting from Iraq during the 1990<U+2013>91 [[Gulf War]]. "When I worked in Baghdad, officials there always used to mention our Sinn Fein ban if you criticised their censorship. I don't like to see this country appearing on the same side of the dividing line as Saddam Hussein on anything at all."<ref name=Independent-1994-09-12/> Another effect of the ban was highlighted at a November 1993 conference on reporting Northern Ireland-related issues chaired by Irish journalist [[Mary Holland]] at the [[University of London]], where several participants claimed it was undermining the practice of [[investigative journalism|investigative reporting]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Leapman |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-speaking-out-on-the-broadcasting-ban-at-a-conference-on-reporting-from-northern-ireland-all-they-could-talk-about-was-what-can-not-be-heard-on-british-tv-or-radio-says-michael-leapman-1506355.html |title=Speaking out on the broadcasting ban: At a conference on reporting from Northern Ireland, all they could talk about was what can not be heard on British TV or radio, says Michael Leapman |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 November 1993 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

Research by the [[Glasgow Media Group]] indicates that coverage of Sinn F<U+00E9>in by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 Sinn F<U+00E9>in was only heard or seen on television 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and 172 with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants.<ref name="glasgow56">{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=56|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&pg=PA56}}</ref> However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of Sinn F<U+00E9>in and Republican viewpoints, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often lead to coverage and films being dropped entirely.<ref name="glasgow5657">{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|pages=56<U+2013>57|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&pg=PA56}}</ref>
