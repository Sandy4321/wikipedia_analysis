'''''Kaga''''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: <U+52A0><U+8CC0>) was an [[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), named after the former [[Kaga Province]] in present-day [[Ishikawa Prefecture]]. Originally intended to be one of two {{sclass|Tosa|battleship}}s, ''Kaga'' was converted under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] to an aircraft carrier as the replacement for the battlecruiser {{ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Amagi||2}}, which had been damaged in an earthquake.  ''Kaga'' was rebuilt in 1933<U+2013>35, increasing her top speed, improving her exhaust systems, and adapting her flight decks to more modern, heavier aircraft.

The third Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service, ''Kaga'' figured prominently in the development of the IJN's carrier striking force doctrine.  The doctrine, which grouped carriers together to give greater mass and concentration to their air power, was a revolutionary strategic concept at the time.  The employment of this doctrine was crucial in enabling Japan to attain its initial strategic goals during the first six months of the [[Pacific War]].

''Kaga''{{'}}s aircraft first supported Japanese troops in China during the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]] of 1932 and participated in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in the late 1930s. With other carriers, she took part in the [[battle of Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor raid]] in December 1941 and the [[battle of Rabaul (1942)|invasion of Rabaul]] in the Southwest Pacific in January 1942. The following month her aircraft participated in a combined carrier airstrike on [[Bombing of Darwin|Darwin, Australia]], helping secure the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|conquest]] of the [[Dutch East Indies]] by Japanese forces. She missed the [[Indian Ocean raid]] in April as she had to return to Japan for permanent repairs after hitting a rock in February.

After repairs ''Kaga'' rejoined the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|1st Air Fleet]] for the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942. After bombarding American forces on [[Midway Atoll]], ''Kaga'' and the other carriers were attacked by American aircraft from the carriers {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}}. Planes from ''Enterprise'' severely damaged ''Kaga''; when it became obvious she could not be saved, she was [[scuttling|scuttled]] by Japanese [[destroyer]]s to prevent her from falling into enemy hands.  The loss of ''Kaga'' and three other IJN carriers at Midway was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.  In 1999, debris from ''Kaga'' was located on the ocean floor; the main body of the carrier has not yet been found.

==Design and construction==
{{See also|Tosa class battleship}}
''Kaga'' was laid down as a {{sclass|Tosa|battleship}}, and was launched on 17 November 1921 at the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] shipyard in [[Kobe]]. On 5 February 1922 both ''Tosa''-class ships were canceled and scheduled to be [[scrap]]ped under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 232; Jentschura, p. 35</ref>

The Treaty authorized conversion of two battleship or battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers of up to {{convert|33000|LT|t|lk=on}} standard displacement. The incomplete battlecruisers ''Amagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi||2}} were initially selected, but the [[1923 Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake|Great Kant<U+014D> Earthquake]] of 1923 damaged ''Amagi''{{'}}s hull beyond economically feasible repair, and ''Kaga'' was selected as her replacement. The formal decision to convert ''Kaga'' to an aircraft carrier was issued 13 December 1923, but no work took place until 1925 as new plans were drafted and earthquake damage to the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] was repaired. She was officially commissioned on 31 March 1928, but this signified only the beginning of sea trials. She joined the [[Combined Fleet]] (''Rengo kantai'') on 30 November 1929 as the IJN's third carrier to enter service, after {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>||2}} (1922) and ''Akagi'' (1927).<ref name=l8>Lengerer, p. 128</ref>

''Kaga'' was completed with a length of {{convert|238.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|31.67|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] at full load of {{convert|7.92|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|26900|LT|MT}} at standard load, and {{convert|33693|LT|MT}} at full load, nearly {{convert|6000|LT|MT}} less than her designed displacement as a battleship.<ref name=l9>Lengerer, p. 129</ref>  Her complement totaled 1340 crewmembers.<ref>Jentschura, p. 42</ref>

===Flight deck arrangements===
[[File:Kaga Ikari 1930 B.jpg|thumb|left|''Kaga'' as completed, with all three flight decks visible]]
''Kaga'', like ''Akagi'', was completed with three superimposed flight decks, the only carriers ever to be designed so. The British carriers converted from "large light cruisers", {{HMS|Glorious|77|6}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|6}}, and {{HMS|Furious|47|6}}, each had two flight decks, but there is no evidence that the Japanese copied the British model. It is more likely that multiple decks were developed independently in the two navies as a means to launch as many aircraft as quickly as possible. ''Kaga''{{'}}s main flight deck was {{convert|171.2|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, her middle flight deck was only about {{convert|15|m|ftin|sp=us}} long and started in front of the bridge, and her lower flight deck was approximately {{convert|55|m|ftin|sp=us}} long. The utility of her middle flight deck was questionable as it was so short that only some of the lightly loaded aircraft could use it, even in an era when the aircraft were much lighter and smaller than they were during World War Two.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 130, 134</ref> At any rate the ever-increasing growth in aircraft performance, size and weight during the 1930s meant that even the bottom flight deck was no longer able to accommodate the take-off roll required for the new generations of aircraft being fielded and it was plated over when the ship was modernized in the mid-1930s.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 130, 136</ref>  ''Kaga''{{'}}s main flight deck was completely flat until a conning tower was added during the modernization.<ref>Peattie, pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>

As completed, the ship had two main hangar decks and a third auxiliary hangar with a total capacity of sixty aircraft. The hangars opened onto the middle and lower flight decks to allow aircraft to take off directly from the hangars while landing operations were in progress on the main flight deck above. No catapults were fitted.<ref name="ireland"/> Her forward [[Elevator#Aircraft_elevators|aircraft lift]] was offset to starboard and {{convert|10.67|by|15.85|m|ft|sp=us}} in size. Her aft lift was on the centerline and {{convert|12.8|by|9.15|m|ftin|sp=us}}. Her [[arresting gear]] was a French transverse system as used on their aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|B<U+00E9>arn||2}} and known as the Model Fju (''Fju shiki'') in the Japanese service.<ref name=l34/>

As originally completed ''Kaga'' carried an air group of 28 [[Mitsubishi B1M|Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers]], 16 [[Nakajima A1N]] fighters and 16 [[Mitsubishi 2MR]] reconnaissance aircraft.<ref name=l9/><ref group=Note>Hata, p. 24, gives the carrier's initial aircraft complement as 12 Type 3 fighters (plus three crated spares), six reconnaissance aircraft (with two spares), and 18 torpedo bombers (six spares).</ref>

===Armament and armor===
''Kaga'' was armed with ten [[20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval gun|20 cm/50 3rd Year Type guns]]: one twin-gun Model B turret on each side of the middle flight deck and six in [[casemate]]s aft. They fired {{convert|110|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a rate of three to six rounds per minute with a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|870|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; at 25<U+00B0>, they had a maximum range between {{convert|22600|and|24000|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The Model B turrets were nominally capable of 70<U+00B0> elevation to provide additional [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) fire, but in practice the maximum elevation was only 55<U+00B0>. The slow rate of fire and the fixed 5<U+00B0> loading angle minimized any real anti-aircraft capability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_79-50_3ns.htm|title=Japanese 20 cm/50 (7.9") 3rd Year Type No. 1|date=19 April 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref><ref>Campbell, p. 187</ref> This heavy gun armament was provided in case she was surprised by enemy cruisers and forced to give battle, but her large and vulnerable flight deck, hangars, and other features made her more of a target in any surface action than a fighting warship.  Carrier doctrine was still evolving at this time and the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized.<ref>Peattie, pp. 53, 55</ref><ref group=Note>The [[United States Navy]] did much the same with the provision of four twin {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} gun turrets on their {{sclass|Lexington|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers. See Gardiner and Grey, p. 110.</ref>

[[Image:Japanese Navy Aircraft Carrier Kaga 1928.jpg|thumb|right|''Kaga''{{'}}s [[fitting-out]] in 1928. In this view of the [[aft]] end of the ship, note the long funnel below the flight deck and the three 8-inch guns in casemates.]]
She was given an anti-aircraft armament of six twin {{convert|12|cm|adj=on|sp=us}} 45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] 10th Year Type Model A2 gun mounts fitted on [[sponson]]s below the level of the funnels, where they could not fire across the flight deck, three mounts per side.<ref>Lengerer, p. 131</ref> These guns fired {{convert|20.3|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|825|-|830|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on|0}}; at 45<U+00B0> this provided a maximum range of {{convert|16000|m|yd|sp=us}}, and they had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|10000|m|ft|sp=us}} at 75<U+00B0> elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 6 to 8 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_47-45_10ns.htm|title=Japan 12 cm/45 (4.7") 10th Year Type |date=28 December 2008|accessdate=11 October 2009|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref><ref>Campbell, p. 194</ref> She had two Type 89 directors to control her 20&nbsp;cm guns and two Type 91 manually powered anti-aircraft directors (''K<U+014D>shaki'') to control her 12&nbsp;cm guns.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 140, 467</ref>

''Kaga''{{'}}s [[Belt armor|waterline armored belt]] was reduced from {{convert|280|to|152|mm|abbr=on}} during her reconstruction and the upper part of her [[Anti-torpedo bulge|torpedo bulge]] was given {{convert|127|mm|abbr=on}} of armor. Her [[Deck (ship)|deck armor]] was also reduced from {{convert|102|to|38|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=l34>Lengerer, p. 134</ref>

===Propulsion===
When ''Kaga'' was being designed the problem of how to deal with exhaust gases in carrier operations had not been resolved. The swiveling funnels of the {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>||2}} had not proved successful and wind-tunnel testing had not provided an answer. As a result, ''Akagi'' and ''Kaga'' were given different exhaust systems to evaluate in real-world conditions. ''Kaga''{{'}}s funnel gases were collected in a pair of long horizontal ducts which discharged at the rear of each side of the flight deck, in spite of predictions by a number of prominent naval architects that they would not keep the hot gases away from the flight deck. The predictions proved to be correct, not least because ''Kaga'' was slower than the ''Akagi'' which allowed the gases to rise and interfere with landing operations. Another drawback was that the heat of the gases made the crew's quarters located on the side of the ship by the funnels almost uninhabitable.<ref name=l34/>

''Kaga'' was completed with four Kawasaki Brown-Curtis geared turbines with a total of {{convert|91000|shp|kW|lk=on|0}} on four shafts. As a battleship her expected speed had been {{convert|26.5|kn|lk=on}}, but the reduction in displacement from {{convert|39900|to|33693|LT|MT|0}} allowed this to increase to {{convert|27.5|kn}}, as demonstrated on her [[sea trial]]s on 15 September 1928. She had twelve Type B (Ro) Kampon boilers with a working pressure of {{convert|20|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}, although only eight were oil-fired. The other four used a mix of oil and coal. She carried {{convert|8000|LT|MT|0}} of fuel oil and {{convert|1700|LT|MT|0}} of coal to give her a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=on}} at {{convert|14|kn}}.<ref name=l34/>

==Early service and development of carrier doctrine==
{{See also|January 28 Incident}}
[[File:Kaga air ops 1930.jpg|thumb|right|''Kaga'' conducting air operations in 1930. On the upper deck are Mitsubishi B1M torpedo bombers preparing for takeoff. Nakajima A1N Type 3 fighters are visible parked on the lower deck forward.]]On 1 December 1931 ''Kaga'' was assigned as the flagship of the [[First Carrier Division]] under the command of Rear Admiral [[Takayoshi Kat<U+014D>]].<ref name ="Hata24">Hata, p. 24</ref> The First Carrier Division, along with ''H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', departed for Chinese waters on 29 January 1932 to support [[Imperial Japanese Army]] troops during the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]] as part of the IJN's [[IJN 3rd Fleet|3rd Fleet]].<ref name=l72/><ref group=Note>The 3rd Fleet at this time was commanded by Vice Admiral [[Kichisabur<U+014D> Nomura]] (Hata, p. 299).</ref>  The B1M3s carried by ''Kaga'' and ''H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'' were the main bombers used during the brief combat over Shanghai.<ref>Peattie, p. 37</ref>

''Kaga''{{'}}s aircraft, operating from both the carrier and a temporary base at Kunda Airfield in [[Shanghai]], flew missions in support of Japanese ground forces throughout February 1932. During one of these missions three of ''Kaga''{{'}}s Nakajima A1N2 fighters, including one piloted by future ace [[Toshio Kuroiwa]], escorting three Mitsubishi B1M3 torpedo bombers, scored the IJN's first air-to-air combat victory on 22 February when they shot down a [[Boeing P-12]] flown by an American volunteer pilot.<ref>Peattie, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref><ref name=Hata24 /><ref group=Note>[[File:Kaga Type 3 fighter pilots.jpg|thumb|right|Ikuta, Kuroiwa, and Takeo pose in front of a Nakajima A1N2 Type 3 fighter aircraft.]] In addition to Petty Officer 3rd Class Kuroiwa, the ''Kaga'' fighter pilots involved in the shootdown were Lieutenant Nokiji Ikuta and Seaman 1st Class Kazuo Takeo (see photo).  Lieutenant Kotani, the leader of the flight of three torpedo bombers, was killed in the engagement.  The American pilot was Robert Short.  The sources do not specify whether Short survived the engagement.  The ''Kaga'' aircrews received a special commendation from the 3rd Fleet commander, Vice Admiral [[Kichisabur<U+014D> Nomura]], for their actions. (Peattie, pp. 50<U+2013>51; Hata, pp. 24, 299)  Future ace [[Mitsugu Mori]] served in ''Kaga's'' fighter unit during this time. (Hata, p. 347)</ref>  ''Kaga'' returned to home waters upon the declaration of the cease-fire on 3 March and resumed fleet training with the rest of the Combined Fleet.<ref name=Hata24 />

At this time, the IJN's developing carrier doctrine was still in its earliest stages.  ''Kaga'' and the other two carriers were initially given roles as tactical force multipliers supporting the fleets's battleships in the IJN's "[[Kantai Kessen|decisive battle]]" doctrine.  In this role, ''Kaga's'' aircraft were to attack enemy battleships with bombs and torpedoes.  Aerial strikes against enemy carriers were later deemed of equal importance in order to establish [[air superiority]] during the initial stages of battle.  The essential component in this strategy was that the Japanese carrier aircraft must be able to strike first with a massed, pre-emptive aerial attack.  As a result, in fleet training exercises the carriers began to operate together in front of or with the main battle line.  The new strategy emphasized maximum speed from both the carriers and the aircraft they carried as well as larger aircraft with greater range.  Thus, longer flight decks on the carriers were required in order to handle the newer, heavier aircraft which were entering service.<ref>Peattie, pp. 72<U+2013>76; Stille, p 13; Goldstein ([[Jisabur<U+014D> Ozawa]]), pp. 76<U+2013>78</ref>

''Kaga'' was soon judged inferior to ''Akagi'' because of her slower speed, smaller flight deck ({{convert|64|ft|m|1}} shorter), and problematic funnel arrangement.  Because of ''Kaga's'' perceived limitations, she was given priority over ''Akagi'' for modernization.<ref>Peattie, pp. 55<U+2013>56</ref>  ''Kaga'' was relegated to reserve status on 20 October 1933 to begin a second major reconstruction, with an official start date of 25 June 1934.<ref name=l72>Lengerer, p. 172</ref>

==Reconstruction==
During her second reconstruction ''Kaga's'' two lower flight decks were converted into hangars and, along with the main flight deck, were extended to the bow. This increased the flight deck length to {{convert|248.55|m|ftin|sp=us}} and raised aircraft capacity to 90 (72 operational and 18 in storage).<ref>Peattie, p. 56</ref>  A third elevator forward, {{convert|11.5|x|12|m|ftin|sp=us}}, serviced the extended hangars.<ref name=l9/> Bomb and [[torpedo]] elevators were modified to deliver their munitions directly to the flight deck. Her arrester gear was replaced by a Japanese-designed Type 1 system. A small starboard island superstructure was also installed.<ref name="ireland">Ireland, pp. 102<U+2013>03</ref>

[[File:Kaga Reconstruction overhead.jpg|thumb|right|''Kaga'' after reconstruction showing the new, full-length flight deck.  The carrier's wide battleship hull is clearly visible.]]Her power plant was completely replaced as were her propellers. New Kampon multi-stage geared turbines were fitted that increased her power from {{convert|91000|to|127400|shp|kW|abbr=on|0}} during trials. Each had a high-pressure, a low-pressure, and a cruising turbine coupled to a single shaft. Her boilers were replaced by eight improved oil-burning models of the Kampon Type B (Ro) with a working pressure of {{convert|22|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on}} at a temperature of {{convert|300|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|abbr=on}}. The hull was lengthened by {{convert|10.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} at the stern to reduce drag and she was given another torpedo bulge above the side armor abreast the upper part of the existing bulge to increase her beam and lower her center of gravity as a result of lessons learned from the [[Tomozuru Incident]] in early 1934. This raised her standard displacement significantly, from {{convert|26900|to|38200|LT|MT|0}}. The extra power and the extra displacement roughly offset each other and her speed increased by less than a knot, up to {{convert|28.34|kn}} on trials. Her fuel storage was increased to {{convert|7500|LT|MT|0}} of [[fuel oil]] which increased her endurance to {{convert|10000|nmi|-1|abbr=on|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}. The lengthy funnel ducting was replaced by a single downturned starboard funnel modeled on that used by the ''Akagi'' with a water-cooling system for the exhaust gasses and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gasses to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. The space freed up by the removal of the funnel ducts was divided into two decks and converted into living quarters for the expanded air group.<ref name=l7>Lengerer, p. 137</ref>  The carrier's complement increased to 1708 crewmembers.<ref name=tp67>Parshall and Tully, p. 467</ref>

The two twin turrets on the middle flight deck were removed and four new 20&nbsp;cm/50 3rd Year Type No. 1 guns in casemates were added forward. Her 12&nbsp;cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight {{convert|12.7|cm|adj=on|sp=us}}/40 Type 89 guns in twin mounts. They fired {{convert|23.45|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a rate between 8 and 14 rounds per minute at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|700|-|725|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; at 45<U+00B0>, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|14800|m|yd|sp=us}}, and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|9400|m|ft|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_5-40_t89.htm|title=Japan 12.7 cm/40 (5") Type 88 12.7 cm/40 (5") Type 89|date=3 December 2008|accessdate=11 October 2009|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref><ref>Campbell, pp. 192<U+2013>93</ref> Their sponsons were raised one deck to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Eleven twin [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us|0}} Type 96]] gun mounts were added, also on sponsons. They fired {{convert|.25|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|900|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}; at 50<U+00B0>, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|7500|m|yd|sp=us|0}}, and an effective ceiling of {{convert|5500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute due to the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNJAP_25mm-60_mg.htm|title=Japan 25 mm/60 (1") Type 96 Model 1|date=4 March 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref><ref>Campbell, p. 200</ref> Six {{convert|6.5|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Type 11 Light Machine Gun|Type 11]] machine guns were also carried.<ref name=l7/> Six Type 95 directors were fitted to control the new 25&nbsp;mm guns, but ''Kaga'' retained her outdated Type 91 anti-aircraft directors.<ref name=tp67/>

Several major weaknesses in ''Kaga's'' design were not rectified. ''Kaga's'' aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier, meaning that shocks to the ship, such as those caused by bomb or shell hits, would be transmitted directly to the tanks, resulting in cracks or leaks.  Also, the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult, at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars.  Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced, fueled, and armed whenever possible on the hanger decks rather than on the flight deck.  Furthermore, there was no redundancy in the ship's fire-extinguishing systems. These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship.<ref>Peattie, pp. 65, 70, 159; Stille, pp. 15<U+2013>16; Willmott, p. 415</ref>

==China incident==

''Kaga'' returned to service in 1935 and was assigned to the [[Second Carrier Division]].  The carrier embarked a new set of aircraft, including 16 [[Nakajima A2N]] Type 90 fighters, 16 [[Aichi D1A]] Type 94 dive bombers, and 28 [[Mitsubishi B2M]] Type 89 torpedo bombers.<ref>Hata, pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>

On 15 August, along with ''H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ry<U+016B>j<U+014D>||2}}, the ship took station in the [[East China Sea]] as part of the 3rd Fleet and began supporting Japanese military operations along the central China coast around Shanghai and further inland.<ref>Peattie, pp. 103<U+2013>04</ref><ref>Hata, p. 25</ref>

''Kaga'' aircraft fought their first battle on 16 August 1937 when six Type 90 fighters engaged four Chinese aircraft over [[Jiangwan Airport|Kiangwan]], shooting down three without loss.  Between 17 August and 7 September, ''Kaga''{{'}}s Type 90 and two [[Mitsubishi A5M]] Type 96 fighters, which joined the carrier on 22 August, engaged Chinese aircraft on several more occasions.  ''Kaga''{{'}}s fighter pilots claimed to have shot down 10 Chinese aircraft in these encounters without loss.<ref>Hata, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref><ref group=Note>Lieutenant Chikamasa Igarashi led the six fighters in the 16 August engagement.  Also participating in that engagement was future ace [[Akio Matsuba]].  The other engagements included:  17 August, when four Type 90s under Warrant Officer Toyoda shot down two Chinese aircraft over Kiangwan; 4 September, two Type 96 fighters under Lieutenant Tadashi Nakajima shot down three [[Curtiss Hawk]]s; 7 September, three Type 90s under Igarashi shot down five aircraft over [[Taihu Lake|T'ai Hu]], with Igarashi claiming three of that number. (Hata, pp. 25<U+2013>26, 263)</ref>  On 17 August twelve of the carrier's bombers attacked [[Hangchow]] without fighter escort and 11 of them were shot down by Chinese fighters.<ref>Howarth, p. 213</ref>  Beginning on 15 September, six Type 90 and six Type 96 fighters, 18 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo bombers were temporarily deployed to Kunda Airfield from the ship to support land operations.<ref name="Hata26">Hata, p. 26</ref>

On 26 September the carrier went to [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] for reprovisioning.  At Sasebo, the carrier received new replacement aircraft including 32 [[Yokosuka B4Y]] Type 96 carrier attack planes (torpedo bombers), 16 [[Aichi D1A2]] Type 96 carrier bombers (dive bombers), and 16 more Type 96 fighters.  Several [[Nakajima A4N]] Type 95 fighter aircraft augmented the carrier's fighter group at an unspecified later date.<ref name = "Hata26" />

''Kaga'' returned to the front in early October 1937, and except for two brief trips to Sasebo, remained off China until December 1938.  Using [[Taiwan]] (then part of the [[Empire of Japan]]) as its base, the carrier steamed {{convert|29048|nmi}} supporting military operations from the [[South China Sea|South]] and East China Seas.  During that time, ''Kaga'' bombers supported army operations by attacking enemy railroad bridges, airfields, and transportation vehicles.  The carrier's fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed at least 17 Chinese aircraft in aerial combat while losing five aircraft themselves.  On 12 December 1937 ''Kaga'' aircraft participated in the [[Panay incident]].<ref>Hata, pp. 26<U+2013>27; Werneth, p. 160; Toland, p. 49</ref><ref group=Note>Six ''Kaga'' fighters were assigned to land bases near Shanghai and Nanking between 9 December 1937 and 15 January 1938.  Nine fighters were temporarily based out of Nanking from 3 March through 4 April 1938.  ''Kaga's'' fighter group at this time included future aces [[Jir<U+014D> Ch<U+014D>no]], [[Osamu Kud<U+014D>]], [[Yoshio Fukui]], [[Watari Handa]], [[Masaichi Kond<U+014D>]], [[Hatsuo Hidaka]], [[Kiichi Oda]], [[Satoru Ono]], and [[Chitoshi Isozaki]]. (Hata, pp. 28, 322, 346, 353, 361, 366, 368)  The US Navy decrypted an IJN message which reportedly indicated that the attack on the {{USS|Panay|PR-5|2}} and other neutral ships in the [[Yangtze River]] had been knowingly and deliberately planned by an air officer on ''Kaga''. (Toland, p. 49)</ref>

''Kaga'' entered the shipyard on 15 December 1938, where her arrester gear was replaced by a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized.  The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity.  The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service.  In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and ''Kaga'' embarked 12 [[Mitsubishi A5M]] fighters, 24 [[Aichi D1A]] dive bombers and 36 [[Yokosuka B4Y]] torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.<ref name=l72/><ref>Hata, p. 27</ref><ref group=Note>Hata, p. 27, gives ''Kaga's'' aircraft complement after overhaul as 12 fighters with four spares, 18 dive bombers with six spares, and 48 torpedo bombers with 16 spares.</ref>

The Japanese carriers' experiences off China had helped further develop the IJN's carrier doctrine.  One lesson learned in China was the importance of concentration in projecting naval air power ashore.  Therefore, in April 1941 the IJN formed the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|First Air Fleet]] to combine all of its fleet carriers under a single command.  On 10 April 1941 ''Kaga'' was assigned to the First Carrier Division with ''Akagi'' as part of the new carrier fleet, which also included the Second and [[Fifth Carrier Division|Fifth]] carrier divisions.  The IJN, however, remained concerned that concentrating all of its carriers together would render them vulnerable to being wiped-out all at once by a massive enemy air or surface strike.  Thus, the IJN developed a compromise solution in which the fleet carriers would operate closely together within their carrier divisions but the divisions themselves would operate in loose rectangular formations, with approximately {{convert|7000|m|yd}} separating the carriers from each other.<ref>Peattie, pp. 124<U+2013>25, 147<U+2013>53; Tully; Stille, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref><ref group=Note>Peattie (p. 152) and [[Jisabur<U+014D> Ozawa]] (Goldstein, pp. 78<U+2013>80) emphasize that the First Air Fleet was ''not'' the IJN's primary strategic striking force.  The IJN still considered the First Air Fleet an integral component in the Combined Fleet's decisive battle task force centered on battleships.</ref>

Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies which gave it, in [[Mark Peattie]]'s words, a {{" '}}[[glass jaw]]':  it could throw a punch but couldn't take one."<ref>Peattie, p. 159</ref>  Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns had several design and configuration deficiencies which limited their effectiveness.  Also, the IJN's fleet [[combat air patrol]] (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including a lack of [[radar]]. In addition, poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. Furthermore, the carriers' escorting warships were not trained to provide close anti-aircraft support.  These deficiencies, combined with the shipboard weaknesses previously detailed, would eventually doom ''Kaga'' and other First Air Fleet carriers.<ref>Peattie, pp. 155<U+2013>59: Stille, pp. 14<U+2013>15, 50<U+2013>51</ref>

==World War Two==
===Pearl Harbor===
{{Details|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}
[[File:Kaga and Zuikaku Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|right|''Kaga'' (foreground), with [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] (background), heads towards Pearl Harbor in heavy seas sometime between 26 November and 7 December 1941.]]
In November 1941 the IJN's Combined Fleet, under [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], prepared to participate in Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a pre-emptive strike against the [[United States Navy]]'s [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] base at [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii.  On 17 November ''Kaga'', under the command of Captain Jisaku Okada,<ref group=Note>Okada was born in [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] in 1893.  He entered the IJN in 1911 and joined the air service in 1922. (Goldstein; Masataka Chihaya, p. 295)</ref> loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay, Hiroshima; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage.  On 19 November, ''Kaga'' and the rest of the Combined Fleet's mobile strike force ([[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy#Kido Butai|''Kido Butai'']]), under [[Chuichi Nagumo]] and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hittokappu Bay at [[Etorofu Island]].  The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes.<ref name="Tully">Tully</ref><ref group=Note>The voyage to Hawaii encountered heavy seas, peaking in intensity on 3 December.  On this day ''Kaga'' suffered its first war casualty when a crewmember was swept away by a wave and lost. (Werneth, p. 107)</ref>

For the attack on Pearl Harbor, ''Kaga'' carried a total of 18 [[Mitsubishi A6M]] Zero [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 27 [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers and 27 [[Aichi D3A]]<ref group=Note>The Allied reporting names for these aircraft were "Zeke", "Kate" and "Val" respectively.</ref> dive bombers, plus three crated aircraft of each type for the operation. During the morning of 7 December 1941 ''Kaga'' aircraft participated in both First Air Fleet strikes launched against [[Oahu]] from a position {{convert|230|nmi|km|-1}} north of the island. In the first strike of 213 total aircraft, 26 ''Kaga'' B5N carrier attack bombers attacked the American ships at anchor with bombs and torpedoes, escorted by nine Zeros. In the second strike of 170 aircraft, 26 ''Kaga'' D3A dive bombers targeted the airfield at [[Ford Island]] in the middle of the harbor while nine Zeros provided escort and attacked aircraft on the ground. A total of five B5N, four Zeros and six D3A from the ship were lost during the two strikes, along with their aircrews, a total of 31 personnel.<ref>Lengerer, p. 174; Stille, p. 19; Werneth, p. 111; Evans and Fuchida, p. 54</ref> ''Kaga''{{'}}s bomber and torpedo crews claimed hits on the battleships {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}, {{USS|Oklahoma|BB-37|2}}, {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|2}}, {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, {{USS|West Virginia|BB-48|2}}, and {{USS|Maryland|BB-46|2}}.<ref>Lengerer, p. 175</ref>  The ship's fighter pilots claimed to have shot down one US aircraft and destroyed 20 on the ground.<ref name="Hata, p. 28">Hata, p. 28</ref><ref group=Note>Fourteen of the B5N in the first wave carried bombs and the other 12 torpedoes.

One B5N crewmember, Yasuji Inoue, was seriously injured by a bullet which shattered his chin. (Werneth, pp. 109, 138, 276)  Five torpedo planes and two Zeros were lost in the first wave and two Zeros and the six dive bombers in the second wave (Werneth, p. 111).  Future fighter ace [[Akira Yamamoto]] participated in the first strike wave and claimed to have shot down a small civilian aircraft over Oahu and destroyed six aircraft on the ground.  Yamamoto was a member of ''Kaga's'' CAP at Midway and survived the battle.  Future ace [[Kiyonobu Suzuki (ace)|Kiyonobu Suzuki]] participated in the second strike.  Suzuki was also at Midway and survived. (Hata, pp. 295, 345)  ''Kaga's'' fighter group was led by [[Yoshio Shiga]] who unsuccessfully tried to be the first airborne in the first strike but was beaten by ''Akagi's'' fighter group leader.

===Pacific conquest===
{{See also|Pacific War}}
In January 1942, together with the rest of the First and [[Fifth Carrier Division]] carriers and staging out of [[Truk]] (now Chuuk) in Micronesia, ''Kaga'' supported the [[battle of Rabaul (1942)|invasion of Rabaul]] in the [[Bismarck Islands]]. ''Kaga'' provided 27 bomb-carrying B5N and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on [[Rabaul]] on 20 January 1942, during which one B5N was shot down by anti-aircraft fire.<ref group=Note>The B5N lost in the raid was crewed by Tatsuyasu Sugihara, Katsuo Yamamoto, and Yoichi Tanaka, who were killed.  They were the first Japanese casualties in the invasion of Rabaul. (Werneth, pp. 115, 140)</ref>  The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby [[Kavieng]] the following day, of which ''Kaga'' contributed nine Zeros and sixteen D3A. On the 22nd ''Kaga''{{'}}s D3A and Zeros again attacked Rabaul and two dive bombers had to make emergency landings, but the crews were rescued. ''Kaga'' returned to Truk on 25 January.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 175<U+2013>76; Werneth, p. 140</ref>

On 9 February ''Kaga'' hit a reef at [[Palau]] after she had unsuccessfully sortied against American carrier forces [[Marshalls-Gilberts raids|attacking]] the [[Marshall Islands]] on 1 February.  The damage reduced the carrier's speed to 18 knots.<ref name="Tully"/><ref group=Note>Takeshi Maeda, a B5N crewmember on ''Kaga'', states that the carrier grounded at Staring Bay in March, not at Palau in February.  The discrepancy is not explained in the sources. (Werneth, p. 116)</ref>  After temporary repairs, she continued to the [[Timor Sea]], where on 19 February 1942 she, with the other carriers of the First and [[Second Carrier Division]]s, launched [[Bombing of Darwin<U+200E>|air strikes]] against [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin, Australia]] from a point {{convert|100|nmi|km|-1}} southeast of the easternmost tip of [[Timor]]. ''Kaga'' contributed 27 B5Ns (carrying bombs), 18 D3A, and 9 Zeros to the attack, which caught the defenders by surprise. Eight ships were sunk, including the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Peary|DD-226|2}}, and fourteen more were damaged, at a cost of only one of ''Kaga''{{'}}s B5Ns. In March 1942, ''Kaga'', based out of [[Staring-baai]], helped cover the invasion of [[Java (island)|Java]], although her only contribution appears to have been aircraft for the 5 March 1942 airstrike on [[Cilacap Regency|Tjilatjap]].  In that attack ''Kaga'' contributed 27 bomb-carrying B5N escorted by nine Zeros.  The attacking aircraft bombed merchant ships in the harbor, sinking eight of them, and attacked anti-aircraft batteries and a warehouse without loss.  ''Kaga'' was unable to participate in the [[Indian Ocean raid]] in April because of the damage she had received in February. Instead, she sailed for [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] on 15 March for repairs, entering [[drydock]] on 27 March.  The repairs were completed on 4 May.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 176<U+2013>77, 305<U+2013>07; Tully; Werneth, p. 140; Gill, p. 590</ref><ref group=Note>While ''Kaga'' was in drydock, on 18 April 12 Zeros from the carrier's air group based at [[Kisarazu Air Field]] participated in the failed counterattack against the US carrier forces which had launched the [[Doolittle raid]] bombers.  The attack group, including 29 land bombers and 12 Zeros from the [[26th Air Flotilla]] in addition to the ''Kaga'' fighters, flew east for {{convert|600|nmi|km|-1}} before turning back after being unable to locate the American carriers, which had already departed the area (Hata, p. 148).  Fighter ace [[Masaaki Shimakawa]] joined the carrier's fighter unit around this time (Sakaida, p. 130).  After the Indian Ocean raid, ''Kaga'' was used for limited air operations training by all the First Air Fleet air units in May as the other carriers were in the shipyard for refitting. (Parshall and Tully, p. 88)</ref>

===Battle of Midway===
{{Details|Battle of Midway}}
====Midway raid====
Concerned by the US carrier strikes in the [[Doolittle Raid|Doolittle]] and Marshall Islands raids, Yamamoto determined to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat.  Yamamoto decided to invade and occupy [[Midway Island]], which he was sure would draw out the American carrier forces to battle.  The Midway invasion was codenamed by the Japanese as Operation ''MI''.<ref>Stille, p. 22</ref>

In support of ''MI'', on 27 May 1942, ''Kaga'' departed the [[Inland Sea]] with the Combined Fleet on her final mission, in the company of carriers ''Akagi'', {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry<U+016B>||2}}, and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>||2}} which constituted the First and Second Carrier Divisions. Her aircraft complement was 27 Zeros, 20 D3As, and 27 B5Ns.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 450<U+2013>51</ref><ref group=Note>Nine of the Zeros were intended to be stationed on Midway after the invasion and belonged to the 6th Air Group.  Two of the D3As were in crates and were either replacements for ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>'' or also members of the 6th Air Group. (Parshall and Tully, p. 451)</ref>  With the fleet positioned {{convert|250|nmi|km|-1}} northwest of [[Midway Island]] at dawn on 4 June 1942, ''Kaga'' contributed eighteen D3As escorted by nine Zeros in a strike against the island.  One each of the D3As and Zeros was shot down by AA fire, and another four D3As were damaged.  ''Kaga''{{'}}s Zero pilots claimed to have shot down 12 US aircraft over Midway Island.  One ''Kaga'' B5N was launched to augment the fleet's reconnaissance of the surrounding ocean.<ref group=Note>Twenty-five total US aircraft were lost over Midway during the air raid. (Willmott, p. 380)  The reconnaissance B5N was commanded by Ensign Haruo Yoshino and covered the search leg south-southeast from the Kido Butai to the west of Midway and over [[Kure Atoll]].  The aircraft did not sight any enemy ships and landed back on ''Kaga'' minutes before the ship was hit by dive bombers. (Werneth, p. 140)</ref> The carrier also put up two Zeros on CAP.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 126, 515; Evans and Fuchida, p. 138</ref><ref name="Hata, p. 28"/>  Another five Zeros reinforced her CAP at 07:00 and the seven fighters helped to defend the Kido Butai from the first US air attackers from Midway Island at 07:10.  Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese ''MI'' plan from [[signals intelligence]] and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 151, 154; Stille, p. 59</ref>

At 07:15 [[Ch<U+016B>ichi Nagumo|Admiral Nagumo]] ordered the B5Ns still on ''Kaga'' and ''Akagi'' rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was limited by the number of ordnance carts used to handle the bombs and [[torpedo]]es and the limited number of ordnance elevators. Thus, the torpedoes could not be struck below until after all the bombs were moved up from their [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]], assembled and mounted on the aircraft. This process normally took about an hour and a half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck and warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message that American carriers had been spotted.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 156<U+2013>59</ref> At 07:30 ''Kaga'' recovered three of her CAP.<ref name=p8>Parshall and Tully, p. 508</ref>

====Sunk====
''Kaga''{{'}}s four remaining CAP fighters were in the process of landing when 16 [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[SBD Dauntless]] dive-bombers from Midway, led by [[Lofton R. Henderson]], attacked ''Hiryu'' around 07:55 without result.<ref>Parshall and Tully, p. 180</ref> Five Zeros were launched at 08:15 and three intercepted a dozen [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es attempting to bomb the three other carriers from {{convert|20000|ft}}, but only limited damage was inflicted on the heavy bombers, although their attacks all missed. Five D3As also joined the CAP around this time. Another trio of Zeros were launched at 08:30. ''Kaga'' began landing her returning Midway strike force aboard around 08:35 and was finished by 08:50; one Zero pilot died after crash-landing his aircraft.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 196, 199</ref><ref group=Note>The Zero pilot who died upon landing was Yukuo Tanaka. (Parshall and Tully, p. 196)</ref>

The five Zeros launched at 08:15 were recovered aboard at 09:10 and replaced by six more Zeros launched at 09:20. They intercepted the first US carrier aircraft to attack, [[TBD Devastator]] torpedo-bombers of [[VT-8]] from the US carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} at 09:22, and shot down all 15, leaving only a single survivor, [[George H. Gay, Jr.]], treading water. Shortly thereafter, 14 Devastators from [[Torpedo Squadron 6|VT-6]] from the US carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, led by [[Eugene E. Lindsey]], were spotted. They tried to sandwich ''Kaga'', but the CAP, reinforced by another six Zeros launched by ''Kaga'' at 10:00, shot down all but four of the Devastators, and the carrier dodged the torpedoes.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 213<U+2013>14; Stille, p. 62</ref>

Soon after the torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese carriers almost undetected and began their dives.  At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from ''Enterprise'', led by [[C. Wade McClusky]], hit ''Kaga'' with one {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bomb and at least three {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada and most of the ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge.<ref group=Note>In addition to Okada, the hit on the bridge likely killed executive officer Captain Masao Kawaguchi, chief gunnery officer Lieutenant Commander Toyosabur<U+014D> Miyano, navigator Commander Ichiji Monden, and communications officer Lieutenant Commander Hidekazu Takahashi. (Parshall and Tully, p. 235)  The ship's maintenance officer, Commander Torao Yamazaki, was killed by the first bomb to hit. (Parshall and Tully, p. 234)  At the time of McClusky's attack, ''Kaga'' likely had two or three Zeros on the flight deck preparing to take off for CAP duty. (Parshall and Tully, p. 231)  ''Kaga'' anti-aircraft gunners shot down one of the dive bombers, piloted by J. Q. Roberts and the sixth to attack.  This was the only dive bomber shot down by any of the Japanese carriers' anti-aircraft gunners this day (Parshall and Tully, p. 234).  McClusky's bombers totalled 28 aircraft, but three split off to attack ''Akagi''. (Lundstrom, pp. 360<U+2013>361)</ref> The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's [[avgas]] lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the emergency generator powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the [[carbon dioxide]] fire suppression system.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 228, 234<U+2013>36, 248<U+2013>50; Stille, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the {{convert|80000|lb|kg}} of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides.<ref>Parshall and Tully, pp. 255<U+2013>56; Willmott, pp. 426<U+2013>27</ref>  At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged ''Akagi'' and ''S<U+014D>ry<U+016B>''.<ref>Stille, p. 63</ref><ref group=Note>{{USS|Nautilus|SS-168|6}} fired four torpedoes at the carrier; one misfired, two others missed, and one hit the burning ''Kaga'' around 14:05, but it was a [[dud]]. (Parshall and Tully, pp. 302<U+2013>03) The torpedo that hit broke in two and the warhead portion sank.  The remaining, floating half was later used as a life preserver by several ''Kaga'' survivors. (Willmott, p. 427)</ref> 

Unable to contain her fires, ''Kaga''{{'s}} survivors were taken off by the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hagikaze||2}} and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Maikaze||2}} between 14:00 and 17:00.<ref group=Note>Parshall and Tully (p. 337) state that the two destroyers rescued over 700 of the carrier's crew.  Since the carrier reportedly had a complement of 1708 (Parshall and Tully, p. 467), there should have been around 900 survivors, but the discrepancy in the numbers is not explained by the sources.</ref>  Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from ''Hagikaze'' and sank stern-first at position {{coord|30|20|N|179|17|W}}.<ref>Parshall and Tully, p. 338; Tully; Werneth, p. 142</ref>  [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] Takeshi Maeda, an injured ''Kaga'' B5N aircrew member rescued by ''Hagikaze'', described the scene: "My comrade carried me up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby.  Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; it was a very sad sight."<ref>Werneth, p. 121</ref>

The carrier's crew suffered 811 fatalities, mainly among the aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on the hangar decks and the ship's engineers.  Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed.<ref>Parshall and Tully, p. 476</ref><ref group=Note>Peattie, p. 338, states that eight ''Kaga'' airmen were killed in the air and 13 died aboard the ship.  Of the 15 ''Kaga'' CAP Zeros airborne at the time the carrier was hit, five were destroyed in aerial combat and the remainder were recovered by ''Hiry<U+016B>''.  Two subsequently participated in the second ''Hiry<U+016B>'' airstrike on ''[[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|Yorktown]]'' while four others augmented the remaining carrier's CAP.  All 10 pilots survived (Parshall and Tully, pp. 502<U+2013>503; Lundstrom, pp. 351, 414).  The two ''Kaga'' fighter pilots who joined the attack on ''Yorktown'' were Akira Yamamoto and Makoto Band<U+014D>. (Parshall and Tully, p. 290)  Four of the five pilots in the downed ''Kaga'' CAP zeros were killed. (Lundstrom, p. 363)  ''Kaga's'' surviving crewmembers were restricted incommunicado to an airbase in Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B> for one to two months after returning to Japan to help conceal word of the Midway defeat from the Japanese public. (Werneth, p. 156) Many of the survivors were then transferred back to frontline units without being allowed to contact family.  Some of the injured were quarantined in hospitals for almost a year.
