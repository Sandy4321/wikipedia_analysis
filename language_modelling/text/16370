The '''Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: '''Norsk rikskringkasting [[Aksjeselskap|AS]]'''), usually known as '''NRK''', is the [[Norway|Norwegian]] government-owned [[radio]] and [[television]] public broadcasting company, and the largest [[Mass media|media]] organisation in Norway. It is a founding member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

==Financing==
94% of NRK's funding comes from a mandatory annual [[television licence|license fee]] charged to each person in possession of a TV.  The remainder comes from commercial activities such as programme and DVD sales, spin-off products and certain types of sponsorship.

==History==
Regular radio broadcasts started in Norway in 1925,[[Kringkastningselskapet]], a privately-owned company founded in 1933 and a predecessor to NRK. Based on a model similar to the [[BBC]], and located in [[Oslo]], it was a replacement for privately operated radio stations in the larger cities. NRK initially set out to get coverage over the entire country, and had a monopoly on broadcasting in [[Norway]]. The monopoly was gradually dissolved from 1975 onwards.

During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation]], Norwegian transmitters were used to broadcast [[Nazi propaganda|German war propaganda]] to Northern Europe (particularly Scotland and the northern half of Ireland where the sea path ensured a good signal) and Scandinavia.

NRK was also partly financed by commercials on radio until the German occupation.

NRK was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] in 1950.  In 1954 NRK started broadcasting television shows on a trial basis, with regular broadcasts starting in 1960. 

NRK was the last of the major European public broadcasters to introduce a second radio station,{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} officially starting as late as 1984. In 1993 NRK launched a third radio station, the youth-oriented ''[[NRK P3|P3]]''. A 24-hour station for classical music, ''Alltid Klassisk'' (now called "[[NRK Klassisk]]"), introduced in 1995, was the first of its kind to be broadcast digitally using [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]]. The 24-hour news station ''[[NRK Alltid Nyheter|Alltid Nyheter]]'' was then introduced in 1997, followed by a radio station for teenagers, ''mP3'', in 2000, which mostly plays dance music continually.

In 1996, a second television channel, [[NRK2]], was launched. The original television channel is now known as [[NRK1]]. On September 3, 2007 NRK launched its third channel: a youth channel called [[NRK3]]. Later that year, on December 1 NRK launched its fourth television channel, [[NRK Super]], which is aimed at children. [[NRK3]] and [[NRK Super]] share the same channel, with NRK Super broadcasting from 0700 - 1900 and NRK3 from 1900 - 0700.

A traditional music radio station, ''NRK Alltid folkemusikk'' (now known as "NRK Folkemusikk") was launched in 2004 on DAB and internet radio.

NRK's international radio transmissions, known as ''Utenlandssendingen'', began [[shortwave]] transmission in 1948. Initially broadcasting in Norwegian, English-language programs were added later. The service was discontinued on January 1, 2002. All NRK broadcasting activities on shortwave ceased on January 1, 2004.  NRK's [[mediumwave]] transmitter at [[Kvits<U+00F8>y]] on 1314 [[kilohertz|kHz]] used to be widely heard internationally and was one of the most commonly-heard trans-Atlantic [[MW DX|DX]] signals in eastern [[North America]]. The frequency carried a mixture of NRK's radio channels P1 and P2, and was called ''Europakanalen'' (literally "The Europe Channel"). However, these [[mediumwave]] transmissions were discontinued on July 1, 2006.

All of NRK's [[Internet radio|radio stations]] are now available on the internet. Several of NRK's [[Internet television|television programmes]] are also available on the internet.

NRK still holds the strongest position in number of viewers, though the competition from [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV&nbsp;2]] is getting tougher.

NRK claims to have the longest running radio show, ''[[L<U+00F8>rdagsbarnetimen]]'' (lit. ''The Saturday Children's Hour''), running since December 20, 1924.

In recent years, the network has shown itself to be the leading producer of original comedy shows in Norway, with such notable successes as ''[[Lille L<U+00F8>rdag]]'', ''<U+00C5>pen Post'', ''[[Uti v<U+00E5>r hage (TV series)|Uti v<U+00E5>r hage]]'' and ''[[Team Antonsen]]'', centered the core comedians [[Harald Eia]] and [[B<U+00E5>rd Tufte Johansen]].

NRK has 12 regional offices around Norway. Each offices has its own broadcasts on both television and radio, as well their own news sites on the internet. They also contribute news coverage for the national news programmes. NRK's headquarters are at [[Marienlyst]] in [[Oslo]] and [[Tyholt]] in [[Trondheim]].

=== Organisation ===

The CEO began major organisational changes in 2008, with the aim of creating a more agile NRK, while still adhering to the principles of the broadcaster-producer model introduced in January 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} By January 2009 the number of programme-producing divisions had been reduced from five to three, separated more along geographical than functional lines, and at the same time simplifying trading in the [[internal market]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The programme producing divisions are: 
* '''Marienlyst''' covering all facilities in [[Oslo]]
* '''Distrikt''', encompassing all regional offices and with their headquarters in [[Trondheim]]
* '''Sami''', the producer of [[S<U+00E1>mi]] programmes situated in [[Karasjok]]

Since March 19, 2007, [[Hans-Tore Bjerkaas]] has been [[Director-General of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]].<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/organisasjonen/1.2897390 Kringkastinggjef], 28 April 2009. Retrieved 2010-01-20.</ref> The previous directors were [[Olav Midttun]] (1934<U+2013>1947, except during the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation]]), [[Kaare Fostervoll]] (1948<U+2013>1962), [[Hans Jacob Ustvedt]] (1962<U+2013>1971), [[Torolf Elster]] (1972<U+2013>1981), [[Bjartmar Gjerde]] (1981<U+2013>1988), [[Einar F<U+00F8>rde]] (1989<U+2013>2001) and [[John G. Bernander]] (2001<U+2013>2007).<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/informasjon/organisasjonen/1.6512091 Kringkastingsjefene], 22 April 2009. Retrieved 2010-01-20.</ref>

The chairman of the board is [[William Nygaard]] and the current head (2006) of the news department is Gro Holm. In 2006, NRK employed between 3000 and 3500 people.
