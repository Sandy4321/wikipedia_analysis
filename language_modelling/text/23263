The '''Attack at Ament's Cabin''' was an event during the [[Black Hawk War]] that occurred on [[June 17]], or [[June 18]], [[1832]]. The cabin site, in present day [[Bureau County, Illinois]], was settled by John L. Ament and his brother in 1829. Ament's brother was quickly bought out by [[Elijah Phillips]]. After the 1832 Black Hawk War broke out Ament and Phillips evacuated the site but returned later to collect belongings. On the morning of June 17 or 18 the men were attacked by a band of [[Potawatomi]] led by [[Mike Girty]], probably those responsible for the [[Indian Creek massacre]] in May. Phillips was killed and the other men took shelter in Ament's cabin. Soldiers from Hennepin arrived after the attack and found Phillips' badly [[tomahawk]]ed body where he had fallen. They set off in a short pursuit of the attackers but eventually returned to [[Hennepin, Illinois]] with the remains of Phillips.

==Background==
The site of Ament's cabin was settled in 1829 when John L. Ament and his brother Justin staked claim on adjacent claims [[Berlin Township, Bureau County, Illinois|Berlin]] and [[Dover Township, Bureau County, Illinois|Dover]] Townships, in present day [[Bureau County, Illinois]]. Shortly after settling, [[Elijah Phillips]] bought Justin Ament's land and built his own cabin.<ref name=berlin>''Past and Present of Bureau County, Illinois'', "[http://www.genealogytrails.com/ill/bureau/Township/BerlinTwp.html History of Berlin]," Pioneer Publishing, Chicago: 1906, p. 118. Retrieved [[4 October]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name=matson/> West of Ament's and Phillips' settlement was a large [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] sugar camp, part of this camp was included in Ament's claim. The camp was a place where Native Americans lived during the winter and spring on an annual basis. The group, a band that included about a dozen families, was led by a chief named [[Meommuse]]. By the time Ament's cabin was constructed, the group had been making sugar at the location for 42 consecutive   years.<ref name=matson/> When the area was settled by Ament and Phillips, relations between the settlers and the Native American tribes began to deteriorate.

As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the [[Governor]] of [[Indiana Territory]] and a group of [[Sauk]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] leaders regarding land settlement, the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in [[Illinois]] and moved west of the [[Mississippi]] in 1828. However, Sauk Chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands.<ref name=lewis/> Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830&ndash;31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the [[Mississippi River]], but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his so-called "British Band" of around 1,000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.<ref name=lewis>Lewis, James.

Retrieved [[6 August]] [[2007]].</ref> A number of other engagements followed, and the militias of [[Michigan Territory]] and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk's Band. The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

==Prelude==
Animosity already existed between Ament and the band under Meommuse at the sugar camp. The Native's historical use of the camp contributed to their anger over Ament building a cabin so close. The bad blood had already boiled over at least once: Ament had shot one of the camp's dogs.<ref name=matson/> Prior to the attack, both Ament and Phillips were warned by [[Potawatomi]] chief [[Shabbona]] of impending danger to the settlers along [[Bureau Creek]]. The men had fled, with their families, leaving their goods and livestock behind.<ref name=armstrong/><ref name=matson/> Eventually, it was decided that it was safe to return to the settlement to tend to the deserted possessions.<ref name=armstrong/>
 
About two weeks after fleeing the site, a party of seven men, Elijah Phillips, J. Hodges, Sylvester Brigham, John L. Ament, Aaron Gunn, James G. Forristall and a 16-year old named Ziba Dimmick left [[Hennepin, Illinois]] for the small settlement along Bureau Creek where Ament's cabin was located.<ref name=tampico/><ref name=matson/> The party left on either [[June 16]] or [[June 17]] (older histories do not agree on the exact day) and reached their destination in the early evening.<ref name=matson/<ref name=armstrong/> The men arrived at Ament's cabin, one and half [[mile]]s (2.4 [[kilometer|km]]) north of present-day [[Dover, Illinois|Dover]], ate dinner and spent the rainy night at the cabin.<ref name=matson/>

The band at the sugar camp was notified of the settlers' return to the cabins by a young warrior who had observed them arriving. While the settlers ate dinner, a group from the sugar camp quietly concealed themselves in the underbrush and approached Ament's cabin undetected. There were Potawatomi among the band, one of whom was a son to Chief Meommuse.<ref name=matson/> The group has been credited with the [[May 21]] [[Indian Creek massacre]] and the murder of a minister, [[Adam Payne]], on the road to [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]].<ref name=armstrong>Armstrong, Perry A.

Rokker: 1887, pp. 399&ndash;403. Retrieved [[4 October]] [[2007]].</ref> This particular group of Potawatomi was under the leadership of an individual called [[Mike Girty]].<ref name=matson/> As the men socialized after dinner, the party of Potawatomi waited in the brush, intending on attacking the settlers as they left the cabin, but as they waited it began to rain. The band waited in the rain for many hours but since the storm did not let up they decided to abandon their plans for attack until the next morning.<ref name=matson>Matson, Nehemiah. ''Memories of Shaubena'', ([http://books.google.com/books?id=oFRy1Qj8MxMC&pg=PA226&dq=%22Elijah+Phillips%22+Black+Hawk&ie=ISO-8859-1#PPA223,M1 Google Books]), D.B.

==Attack==
The next morning, either [[June 17]] or [[June 18]], the band of about 30 Native Americans returned to their hidden positions of the day before and awaited the settlers.<ref name=matson/><ref name=armstrong/> When the settlers awoke Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the [[moccasin]] tracks around the property. Phillips decided to go to his cabin, about a half mile (.8 km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents.<ref name=armstrong/> Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, when he did he heard the crack of a [[rifle]] outside. Phillips dropped to the ground, struck by two [[musket]] balls, and the band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their [[tomahawk]]s.<ref name=tampico/><ref name=matson/>

The settlers rushed into the cabin as the raiding warriors surrounded the house. They shut the door and aimed their rifles through cracks in the walls.<ref name=matson/> Two of the men stood near the doorway with their rifles, and Hodges' rifle came into contact with Girty's chest causing him to fall back to the woods. His comrades followed his lead, and the group made a hasty retreat.<ref name=armstrong/><ref name=matson/><ref name=tampico>Matson, Nehemiah.

Retrieved [[4 October]] [[2007]].</ref>

Young Dimmick, anxious to the point of begging to leave, was then dispatched to Hennepin by horseback for help.<ref name=tampico/><ref name=armstrong/> The men at the cabin wholly expected Dimmick to be shot as soon as he rode off, but he crossed the open [[prairie]] unscathed.<ref name=armstrong/> Dimmick made the 16 mile (25.7 km) journey and arrived in Hennepin to report the attack.<ref name=matson/>

==Aftermath==
Dimmick's arrival with the news of the attack at Hennepin was not well received, it caused a general panic as citizens were convinced that [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]'s entire [[British Band]] was poised to attack the town.<ref name=matson/> In Hennepin that day were two companies of Rangers, and a call for volunteers went out among them to help the settlers at Ament's cabin.<ref name=matson/> Volunteers were gathered, and though some were reluctant to go to the rescue between 30 and 70 men set off to the site of the attack.<ref name=matson/><ref name=armstrong/>

The men arrived at the cabin site, and found the other men safely barricaded inside the cabin; Ament waved a [[white flag]] through the roof to signal the soldiers as they approached.<ref name=matson/> They found the undisturbed body of Phillips lying where he had fallen, in the door yard with his face upturned.<ref name=tampico/> He had been shot through the left side of his chest and through the stomach. His body was badly tomahawked, with tomahawks slashes across one eye and his neck.<ref name=tampico/><ref name=armstrong/> He had not, however, been [[scalping|scalped]].<ref name=armstrong/><ref name=tampico/> The Rangers formed a small detachment and set off in pursuit of the attackers but they gave up pursuit and returned to Hennepin with Phillips' remains. The funeral occurred the next day and was attended by citizens and soldiers alike.<ref name=tampico/>
