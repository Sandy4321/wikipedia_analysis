'''World War I''' (abbreviated as '''WW-I''', '''WWI''', or '''WW1'''), also known as the '''First World War''', the '''Great War''', the '''World War''' (prior to the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]]), and the '''War to End All Wars''', was a [[military conflict]] which involved most of the world's [[great powers]],<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=10}}</ref> assembled in two opposing alliances: the [[Allies of World War I]] centred around the [[Triple Entente]] and the [[Central Powers]], centred around the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].<ref name=Willmott15>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=15}}</ref>  More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bade|Brown|2003|pp=167-168}}</ref> More than 15 million people [[World War I casualties|were killed]], making it one of the [[list of wars and disasters by death toll|deadliest conflicts]] in history.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=307}}</ref>

The [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination on 28 June 1914]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, is seen as the immediate trigger of the war, though long-term causes, such as [[imperialistic]] foreign policy, played a major role.  Ferdinand's assassination at the hands of [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbian]] nationalist [[Gavrilo Princip]] resulted in demands against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].<ref name="AJPT2">{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=80-93}}</ref> Several alliances that had been formed over the past decades were invoked, so within weeks the major powers were at war; with all having [[colony|colonies]], the conflict soon spread around the world.

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}

In the 19th century, the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] throughout Europe, resulting by 1900, in a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent.<ref name=Willmott15/> These had started in 1815, with the [[Holy Alliance]] between Germany (then [[Prussia]]), Russia, and Austria<U+2013>Hungary. Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between the monarchs of Austria<U+2013>Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria<U+2013>Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria<U+2013>Hungary in an alliance  formed in 1879, called the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]]. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the [[Balkans]] as the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to weaken.<ref name=Willmott15 /> In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].<ref name=keegan52>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|p=52}}</ref> 

After 1870, European conflict was averted largely due to a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe&mdash;orchestrated by Chancellor Bismarck. He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. With the ascension of [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] as [[German Emperor]] (''Kaiser''), Bismarck's system of alliances was gradually de&ndash;emphasised.  For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1890. Two years later the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, the United Kingdom sealed an alliance with France, the [[Entente cordiale]] and in 1907, the [[United Kingdom]] and Russia, signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. This system of bi-national agreement formed the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name=Willmott15/> 

[[Image:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|alt=Ship at sea with smoke emitting from two funnels|[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|''HMS Dreadnought'']]. A naval [[arms race]] existed between the United Kingdom and Germany]]

German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after unification and the foundation of the empire in 1870. From the mid&ndash;1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the [[Imperial German Navy]] (German: ''Kaiserliche Marine''), established by Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], in rivalry with the British [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.<ref name=willmott21/> As a result, both nations strove to out build each other in terms of [[capital ships]]. With the launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over their German rivals.<ref name=willmott21>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=21}}</ref> The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to the production of the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.<ref>{{harvnb|Prior|1999|p=18}}</ref> Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50%.<ref name="Fromkin2004">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=94}}</ref>

Austria&ndash;Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908&ndash;1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of Bosnia Herzegovina, which they had occupied since 1878. This greatly angered the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and thus pro&ndash;Serbian [[Romanov Dynasty]] who ruled Russia and the Kingdom of Serbia, because Bosnia Herzegovina contained a significant Slavic Serbian population.<ref name=keegan48-49>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48&ndash;49}}</ref> Russian political maneuvering in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as "the [[Powder keg of Europe]]".<ref name=keegan48-49 /> 

In 1912 and 1913, the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent [[Albania|Albanian State]] while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913 it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania in the 33 day [[Second Balkan War]], further destabilizing the region.<ref name=Willmott22-23>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=22&ndash;23}}</ref>

On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a Bosnian-Serb student and member of [[Young Bosnia]], assassinated the heir to the Austro&ndash;Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.<ref name=Willmott26>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}</ref> This began a period of diplomatic manoeuvring between Austria&ndash;Hungary, Germany, Russia, France and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Wanting to end Serbian interference in Bosnia conclusively, Austria&ndash;Hungary delivered the [[July Ultimatum]] to Serbia, a series of ten demands which were deliberately unacceptable, made with the intention of deliberately initiating a war with Serbia.<ref name=Willmott27>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}</ref> When Serbia acceded to only eight of the ten demands levied against it in the ultimatum, Austria&ndash;Hungary declared war on Serbia on 28 July 1914. [[Hew Strachan|Strachan]] argues "Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria&ndash;Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful. Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning".<ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|p=68}}</ref> 

The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria<U+2013>Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its long time Serb proteges, ordered a partial mobilization one day later.<ref name=keegan52 /> When the German Empire began to mobilise on 30 July 1914, France&mdash;sporting significant animosity over the German conquest of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]&mdash;ordered French mobilization on 1 August. Germany declared war on Russia on the same day.<ref>{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=29}}</ref>

==Chronology==
===Opening hostilities===
====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria&ndash;Hungary<U+2019>s invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but never tested in exercises. Austro&ndash;Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|pp=292&ndash;296, 343&ndash;354}}</ref><!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: "Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War" --> Germany, however, envisioned Austria&ndash;Hungary directing the majority of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

On September 9, 1914 the [[Septemberprogramm]], a plan which detailed Germany's specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force upon the Allied Powers, was outlined by [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|German Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]].

====African campaigns====
{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}
Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French and German colonial forces in Africa. On 7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]]. On 10 August German forces in [[Namibia|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the remainder of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerilla warfare]] campaign for the duration of World War I and surrendered only two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.<ref>{{citation| author=Byron Farwell| title=The Great War in Africa, 1914-1918| isbn=0393305643| p=353}}</ref>

====Serbian campaign====
{{Main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}
The Serbian army fought the [[Battle of Cer]] against the invading Austrians, beginning on 12 August, occupying defensive positions on the south side of the [[Drina River|Drina]] and [[Sava]] rivers. Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victory of the war and dashed Austrian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=172}}</ref>

====German forces in Belgium and France====

A message on the car spells out "Trip to Paris"; early in the war all sides expected the conflict to be a short one.]]
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
  
At the outbreak of the First World War, the German army (consisting in the West of [[German Army order of battle (1914)|Seven Field Armies)]] executed a modified version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border.<ref name=AJPT2/> The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris and initially, the Germans were very successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14 August&ndash;24 August). By 12 September, the French with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British forces]] halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5 September&ndash;12 September).  The last days of this battle signified the end of mobile warfare in the west.<ref name=AJPT2/>

In the east, only one Field Army defended [[East Prussia]] and when Russia attacked in this region it diverted German forces intended for the Western Front. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&ndash;2 September), but this diversion exacerbated problems of insufficient speed of advance from rail-heads not foreseen by the [[German General Staff]]. The Central Powers were thereby denied a quick victory and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of obtaining an early victory.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=376-8}}</ref>

====Asia and the Pacific====
{{Main|Asian and Pacific theatre of World War I}}
New Zealand [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied German Samoa]] (later [[Western Samoa]]) on 30 August. On 11 September the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] landed on the island of [[New Britain|Neu Pommern]] (later New Britain), which formed part of [[German New Guinea]]. Japan seized Germany's [[Micronesia]]n colonies and, after the [[Battle of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] in the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1968|pp=224&ndash;232}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Falls|1960|pp=79-80}}</ref>

===Early stages===
====Trench warfare begins====
{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology. These changes resulted in the building of impressive defence systems, which out of date tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances. [[Artillery]], vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine guns]], made crossing open ground very difficult.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=424}}</ref> The Germans introduced [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]]; it soon became used by both sides, though it never proved decisive in winning a battle. Its effects were brutal, causing slow and painful death, and poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as the [[tank]].<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421-423}}</ref> Britain and France were its primary users; the Germans employed captured Allied tanks and small numbers of their own design.

After the [[First Battle of the Marne]], both [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvre's, in the so-called '[[Race to the Sea]]'. Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German forces from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's [[Flanders|Flemish]] coast.<ref name=AJPT2/> Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories; consequently, German trenches were generally much better constructed than those of their enemy. Anglo&ndash;French trenches were only intended to be 'temporary' before their forces broke through German defences.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=199 (footnote)}}</ref> Both sides attempted to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. In April 1915, the Germans used [[chlorine gas]] for the first time (in violation of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]), opening a six kilometre (four mile) hole in the Allied lines when British and French colonial troops retreated. [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian soldiers]] closed the breach at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]]. At the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], Canadian and [[ANZAC]] troops took the village of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]].

[[Image:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |In the [[trench]]es: [[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench on the [[first day on the Somme]], 1 July 1916.]]
The [[British Army]] endured the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties and 19,240 dead on 1 July 1916, the [[first day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men.<ref>{{harvnb|Duffy}}</ref>

Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years, though protracted German action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] throughout 1916,<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1221}}</ref> combined with the bloodletting at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French ''[[poilu]]'' (infantry) and led to [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|widespread mutinies]], especially during the [[Nivelle Offensive]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=854}}</ref>

[[Image:GermanInfantry1914.jpg|thumb|alt=In the foreground three German soldiers behind cover engage aqttacking French soldiers |A French assault on German positions. Champagne, France, 1917.]]
Throughout 1915&ndash;17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, due both to the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. At the strategic level, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines. At the tactical level, Ludendorff's doctrine of "[[defense in depth|elastic defence]]" was well suited for trench warfare. This defence had a relatively lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range, from which an immediate and powerful counter-offensive could be launched.<ref>{{harvnb|Heer|2009|pp=223-4}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=226}}</ref> 

Ludendorff wrote on the fighting in 1917, "The 25th of August concluded the second phase of the Flanders battle. It had cost us heavily. ... The costly August battles in Flanders and at Verdun imposed a heavy strain on the Western troops. In spite of all the concrete protection they seemed more or less powerless under the enormous weight of the enemy<U+2019>s artillery. At some points they no longer displayed the firmness which I, in common with the local commanders, had hoped for. The enemy managed to adapt himself to our method of employing counter attacks<U+2026> I myself was being put to a terrible strain. The state of affairs in the West appeared to prevent the execution of our plans elsewhere. Our wastage had been so high as to cause grave misgivings, and had exceeded all expectation."<ref>{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919|p=480}}</ref>

On the battle of the Menin Road Ridge Ludendorff wrote: "Another terrific assault was made on our lines on the 20 September<U+2026>. The enemy<U+2019>s onslaught on the 20th was successful, which proved the superiority of the attack over the defence. Its strength did not consist in the tanks; we found them inconvenient, but put them out of action all the same.  The power of the attack lay in the artillery, and in the fact that ours did not do enough damage to the hostile infantry as they were assembling, and above all, at the actual time of the assault."<ref name = "Terraine-Victory">{{harvnb|Terraine|1963}}</ref>
[[Image:BC RGA Leaders In England.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Officers and senior enlisted men of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]]'s [[Bermuda]] Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery, in Europe.]]

Around 1.1 to 1.2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time<ref>.{{harvnb|Perry|1988|p=27}}</ref> A thousand battalions, occupying sectors of the line from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Orne River (Lorraine)|Orne River]], operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over {{convert|9600|km|mi|0}} of trenches. Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the [[Poperinge]] or [[Amiens]] areas.

In the 1917 [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] the only significant British military success was the capture of [[Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]] under [[Sir Arthur Currie]] and [[Julian Byng]]. The assaulting troops were able for the first time to overrun, rapidly reinforce and hold the ridge defending the coal-rich [[Douai]] plain.<ref>{{citation| title=Vimy Ridge, Canadian National Memorial| year=2007| work=Australians on the Western Front 1914-1918| url=http://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/vimy-ridge/index.html| work=Australians on the Western Front 1914-1918| publisher=New South Wales Department of Veteran's Affairs and Board of Studies}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Winegard}}</ref>

===Naval war===
{{Main|Naval Warfare of World War I}}
[[Image:Grand Fleet sails.jpg|thumb|The [[British Grand Fleet]] making steam for [[Scapa Flow]], 1914]]
At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping. The British [[Royal Navy]] systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser {{SMS|Emden}}, part of the East&ndash;Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, the bulk of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]<U+2014>consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|N<U+00FC>rnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and two transport ships<U+2014>did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it encountered elements of the British fleet. The German flotilla, along with {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}}, sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was almost destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the [[Battle of M<U+00E1>s a Tierra]] these too were destroyed or interned.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|pp=39<U+2013>47}}</ref>

[[Image:Hochseeflotte 2.jpg|thumb|A battleship squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet|Hochseeflotte]] at sea]]
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.<ref name="isbn0-313-33181-2">{{harvnb|Keene|2006|p=5}}</ref> Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.<ref name="isbn1-85728-498-4">{{harvnb|Halpern|1995|p=293}}</ref> Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.<ref name="isbn0-8476-9645-6">{{harvnb|Zieger|2001|p=50}}</ref>

The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or "Battle of the Skagerrak") developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war. It took place on 31 May&ndash;1 June 1916, in the [[North Sea]] off [[Jutland]]. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], squared off against the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, out manoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=619-24}}</ref>

German [[U-boats]] attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.<ref name="Sheffield">{{citation| last=Sheffield| first=Garry| title=The First Battle of the Atlantic| work=World Wars In Depth| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/battle_atlantic_ww1_01.shtml| publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-11-11 }}</ref> The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.<ref name="Sheffield" /><ref name="isbn0-8050-7617-4">{{harvnb|Gilbert|2004|p=306}}</ref> The United States launched a protest, and Germany modified its rules of engagement.

[[Image:NationaalArchief uboat155London.jpg|thumb|First U-boat of the German fleet surrendering near Tower Bridge, London, 1918.]]
The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships entered [[convoy]]s escorted by destroyers. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the introduction of [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charges]], accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. The convoy system slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters. Troop ships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/hansard//comm/va/va_2006nov09.htm| title=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs| accessdate=2007-10-30| work=Hansard}}</ref> The U-boats had sunk almost 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 178 submarines.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.uboat.net/history/wwi/part6.htm| title=The U-boat War in World War One| accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> 

World War I also saw the first use of [[aircraft carrier]]s in combat, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a successful raid against the [[Zeppelin]] hangars at [[Tondern raid|Tondern]] in July 1918, as well as [[blimp]]s for antisubmarine patrol.<ref>{{harvnb|Price}}</ref>

===Southern theatres===
====War in the Balkans====
{{Main|Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Macedonian front (World War I)}}
Faced with Russia, Austria&ndash;Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counter attack in the [[battle of Kolubara]], however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria&ndash;Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro&ndash;Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading [[Bulgaria]] to join in attacking Serbia. The Austro&ndash;Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria&ndash;Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy. [[Montenegro]] allied itself with Serbia.<ref>{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=54&ndash;5}}</ref>

Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month. The attack began in October, when the Central Powers launched an offensive from the north; four days later the Bulgarians joined the attack from the east. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into [[Albania]], halting only once to make a stand against the Bulgarians. The Serbs suffered defeat near modern day [[Gnjilane]] in the [[Battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat toward the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6&ndash;7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro, too. Serbian forces were evacuated by ship to Greece.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075&ndash;6}}</ref>

In late 1915, a Franco&ndash;British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro&ndash;Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive.<ref>{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=108&ndash;10}}</ref>

[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb|Austrian troops executing captured Serbians in 1917.]]After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro&ndash;Hungary and Bulgaria. Bulgarians commenced bulgarization of the Serbian population in their occupation zone, banishing [[Serbian Cyrillic]] and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. After forced conscription of the Serbian population into the Bulgarian army in 1917, the [[Toplica]] Uprising began. Serbian rebels liberated for a short time the area between the [[Kopaonik]] mountains and the [[South Morava]] river. The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917.

The Macedonian Front proved static for the most part. Serbian forces retook part of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916. Only at the end of the conflict were the Entente powers able to break through, after most of the German and Austro&ndash;Hungarian troops had withdrawn. The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]] but days later, they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the [[Battle of Doiran]], avoiding occupation. Bulgaria signed an armistice on 29 September 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}</ref>

====Ottoman Empire====
{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}
[[Image:Capture of Jerusalem 1917d.jpg|thumb|British artillery placements in the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)]].]]
The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war, the secret [[Ottoman-German Alliance]] having been signed in August 1914.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/turkgerm.asp The Treaty of Alliance Between Germany and Turkey] 2 August 1914</ref> It threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian Campaign|Mesopotamian]] campaigns. In Gallipoli, Turkey successfully repelled the British, French and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous [[Siege of Kut]] (1915&ndash;16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917. Further to the west, in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]], initial British setbacks were overcome when [[Jerusalem]] was captured in December 1917. The [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], under Field Marshal [[Edmund Allenby]], broke the Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918.

Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Turkish armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of conquering [[central Asia]]. He was, however, a poor commander.<ref name="isbn0-8050-6884-8">{{harvnb|Fromkin|2001|p=119}}</ref> He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops; insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter, he lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamis]].<ref name=caven>{{harvnb|Hinterhoff|1984|pp=499<U+2013>503}}</ref>

The Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Yudenich]], drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.<ref name=caven />
In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from [[Georgia (country)|Russian Georgia]] to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917, (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the [[February Revolution]] and the [[Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart. In this situation, the army corps of [[Armenian volunteer units]] realigned themselves under the command of General [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]], with [[Drastamat Kanayan|Dro]] as a civilian commissioner of the [[Administration for Western Armenia]]. The front line had three main divisions: [[Movses Silikyan]], [[Andranik Toros Ozanian|Andranik]], and [[Mikhail Areshian]]. Another regular unit was under Colonel Korganian. There were Armenian [[Armenian irregular units|partisan guerrilla detachments]] (more than 40,000<ref name="bogus">[[Boghos Nubar]] the president of the "[[Armenian National Assembly (Ottoman Empire)|Armenian National Assembly]]" declared to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]] through a letter to French Foreign Office <U+2013> 3 December 1918</ref>) accompanying these main units.

The [[Arab Revolt]] (described in ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'') was a major cause of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s defeat. The revolts started with the [[Battle of Mecca 1916|Battle of Mecca]] by Sherif Hussain of [[Mecca]] with the help of Britain in June 1916, and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]] the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]] showed stubborn resistance for over two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]].

Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, the [[Senussi]] tribe, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerilla war against Allied troops. According to Martin Gilbert's ''The First World War'', the British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to deal with the Senussi. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.

====Italian participation====
{{Main|Italian Campaign (World War I)}}
[[Image:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol]]
Italy had been allied with the German and Austro&ndash;Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Province of Trento|Trentino]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.<ref>{{harvnb|Page}}</ref> At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria<U+2013>Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro&ndash;Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of [[Tunisia]] in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the Alpine province of [[South Tyrol]] and territory on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast after the defeat of Austria&ndash;Hungary.  This was fomalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]].  Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria&ndash;Hungary on May 23. Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.

Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening [[Vienna]]. It was a [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] plan, which had no realistic chance of success in an age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and mountainous terrain.

On the Trentino front, the Austro&ndash;Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaisersch<U+00FC>tzen]] and [[:de:Standsch<U+00FC>tzen|Standsch<U+00FC>tzen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro&ndash;Hungarians counter attacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[So<U+010D>a|Isonzo front]] along the [[So<U+010D>a|Isonzo River]], north east of [[Trieste]]. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro&ndash;Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austrians received large numbers of reinforcements, including German [[Stormtrooper]]s and the elite [[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]. The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]]. The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100&nbsp;kilometres (60&nbsp;mi.) to reorganise, stabilizing the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since in the Battle of Caporetto Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so called '''99 Boys'' (Ragazzi del '99), that is, all males who were 18 years old. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the [[Asiago|Asiago Plateau]], finally being decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October of that year. Austria&ndash;Hungary surrendered in early November 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Hickey|2003|pp=60<U+2013>65}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|pp=585-9}}</ref>

====Fighting in India====
The war began with an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from within the mainstream political leadership, contrary to initial British fears of an Indian revolt. India under British rule contributed greatly to the British war effort by providing men and resources. This was done by the Indian Congress in hope of achieving self-government as India was very much under the control of the British. The United Kingdom disappointed the Indians by not providing self-governance, leading to the [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]an Era in Indian history. About 1.3&nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all 140,000&nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totaled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm| title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War| publisher=Memorial Gates Trust| accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref>

=====Indian independence movement=====
{{Further|[[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]|[[Hindu-German Conspiracy]]}}
[[Bengal]] and [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] remained hotbeds of [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|anti-colonial activities]]. Terrorism in Bengal, increasingly closely linked with the unrest in Punjab, was significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration. Also from the beginning of the war, expatriate Indian population, notably in Germany, United States and Canada, headed by the [[Indian Independence Committee]] and the [[Ghadar Party]] respectively, attempted to trigger insurrections in India on the lines of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 uprising]] with [[Irish Republican]], German and Turkish help in a great conspiracy that has since become known as the Hindu German conspiracy. The conspiracy [[Niedermayer-Hentig mission|also made]] attempts to rally the Amir of Afghanistan against British India, starting a political process in that country that culminated three years later in the assassination of Amir Habibullah and precipitation of the Third Anglo-Afghan war. A number of failed attempts at mutiny were made in India, of which the [[Ghadar Conspiracy#February 1915|February mutiny plan]] and the [[1915 Singapore Mutiny|Singapore mutiny]] remain most notable. This movement was suppressed by means of a vast international counter intelligence operation and draconian political acts (including the [[Defence of India act 1915]]) that lasted nearly ten years.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1977|p=}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|2002|p=474}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dignan|1971|p=57}}</ref>

The Ghadarites also attempted to organise incursions from the western border of India, recruiting Indian prisoners of war from Turkey, Germany, Mesopotamia. Ghadarite rebels, led by [[Sufi]] Amba Prasad, fought along with Turkish forces in Iran and in Turkey. Plans were made in [[Constantinopole]] to organise a campaign from Persia, through [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], to Punjab. These forces were involved skirmishes that captured the frontier city of Karman, taking into custody the British consul. [[Percy Sykes]]'s campaign in Persia was directed mostly against these composite forces. It was at this time that the [[Aga Khan]] and his brother were recruited into the British War effort. However, the Aga Khan's brother was captured and shot dead by the rebels, who also successfully harassed British Forces in [[Sistan]] in Afghanistan, confining British forces to [[Karamshir]] in Baluchistan, later moving towards [[Karachi]]. They were able to take control of the coastal towns of Gawador and Dawar. The Baluchi chief of Bampur, having declared his independence from the British rule, also joined the Ghadarite forces. It was not before the war in Europe turned for the worse for Turkey and [[Baghdad]] was captured by the British forces that the Ghadarite forces, their supply lines starved, were finally dislodged. They retreated to regroup at [[Shiraz]], where they were finally defeated after a siege. Amba Prasad Sufi was killed in this battle. The Ghadarites carried on guerilla warfare along with the Iranian partisans till 1919.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sykes|1921|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Singh}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Herbert|2003|p=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asghar|2005}}</ref>

Although the conflict in India was not explicitly a part of the First World War, it was part of the wider strategic context. The British attempt to subjugate the rebelling tribal leaders drew away much needed troops from other theatres, in particular, of course, the Western Front, where the real decisive victory would be made.

The reason some Indian and Afghani tribes rose up simply came down to years of discontent which erupted, probably not coincidentally, during the First World War. It is likely that the tribal leaders were aware that Britain would not be able to field the required men, in terms of either number or quality, but underestimated the strategic importance of India to the British. Despite being far from the epicentre of the conflict, India provided a bounty of men for the fronts. Its produce was also needed for the British war effort and many trade routes running to other profitable areas of the Empire ran through India. Therefore, although the British were not able to send the men that they wanted, they were able to send enough to mount a gradual but effective counter-guerilla war against the tribesmen. The fighting continued into 1919 and in some areas lasted even longer.

====Initial actions====
{{Main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}

While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe. Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and German East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, they were driven back from East Prussia by [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|p=715}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2006|pp=152-4, 161, 163, 175, 182}}</ref> Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated into Galicia, and in May the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers.<ref name="Smele">{{harvnb|Smele}}</ref> On 5 August they captured [[Warsaw]] and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.

====Russian Revolution====
{{Main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}
{{See|North Russia Campaign}}
Despite the success of the June 1916 [[Brusilov offensive]] in eastern [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Schindler|2003}}</ref> dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew. The success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily with [[Romania]]'s entry into the war on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austrian units in [[Transylvania]] and [[Bucharest]] fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] remained at the front. [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra's]] increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

[[Image:Lenin.WWI.JPG|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Illyich Lenin]]]]
In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.<ref name="Smele" />

The war and the government became increasingly unpopular. Discontent led to a rise in popularity of the [[Bolshevik]] [[political party|party]], led by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. He promised to pull Russia out of the war and was able to gain power. The [[October Revolution|triumph of the Bolsheviks]] in November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when Germany resumed the war and marched across [[Ukraine]] with impunity, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. It took Russia out of the war and ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and [[Ukraine]] to the Central Powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Wheeler-Bennett|1956}}</ref> The manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive, however, and secured relatively little food or other war materiel.<!-- yes, it is spelled "iel" for this meaning -->

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led a small-scale invasion of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the Whites in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] and in [[Vladivostok]].

===Wilhelm declares victory===
[[Image:Franz Stassen - WWI - An das deutsche Volk.png|thumb|1917 German poster: Wilhelm II blames the Allies for fighting on.]]

In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the [[Battle of Verdun]], the Germans attempted to negotiate peace with the Allies, declaring themselves the victors. U.S. President Wilson attempted to intervene, asking both sides to state their demands. The Allies, knowing they were in a weak bargaining position, rebuffed the offer.<ref>{{citation| last=Kernek| first=Sterling| title=The British Government's Reactions to President Wilson's 'Peace' Note of December 1916| journal=The Historical Journal| volume=13| issue=4| date=December 1970| pages=721<U+2013>766 |jstor=2637713}}</ref>

===1917&ndash;1918===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Sch<U+00FC>tzengraben.jpg|thumb|Photographic documentation of combat]]
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918. The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the reintroduced [[convoy]] system became extremely effective in neutralizing the [[U-boat]] threat. Britain was safe from starvation and German industrial output fell.
[[Image:Guetteur au poste de l'<U+00E9>cluse 26.jpg|thumb|[[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]

On 3 May 1917 during the [[Nivelle Offensive]] the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused their orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. There upon the [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] afflicted 54 French divisions <!-- yes "54 divisions" plural, not a division number --> and saw 20,000 men desert. The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties.<ref>Lyons, 243.</ref> However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks. 

The victory of Austria<U+2013>Hungary and Germany at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] led the Allies at the [[Rapallo Conference]] to form the [[Supreme War Council]] to coordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. This released troops for use in the west. Ironically, German troop transfers could have been greater if their territorial acquisitions had not been so dramatic. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for a quick offensive. Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.<ref name="isbn0-313-29880-7">{{harvnb|Heyman|1997|pp=146<U+2013>147}}</ref>

====Entry of the United States====
=====Isolationism=====
The [[United States of America|United States]] originally pursued a policy of [[isolationism]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. This resulted in increased tensions with Berlin and London. When a German U-boat sank the British liner [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] vowed, "America is too proud to fight" and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law and U.S. ideas of human rights. Wilson was under pressure from former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who denounced German acts as "piracy".<ref>{{harvnb|Brands|1997|p=756}}</ref> Wilson's desire to have a seat at negotiations at war's end to advance the [[League of Nations]] also played a role.<ref name = "Karp-PoW-1979">{{harvnb|Karp|1979}}</ref> Wilson's Secretary of State, [[William Jennings Bryan]], resigned in protest at what he felt was the President's decidedly warmongering diplomacy. Other factors contributing to the U.S. entry into the war include the suspected German sabotage of both [[Black Tom]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], and the [[Kingsland Explosion]] in what is now [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]].

=====Making the case=====
In January 1917, after the Navy pressured the Kaiser, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. Britain's secret Royal Navy [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic]] group, [[Room 40]], had broken the German diplomatic code. They intercepted a proposal from Berlin (the [[Zimmermann Telegram]]) to [[Mexico]] to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States, should the U.S. join. The proposal suggested that if the U.S. were to enter the war then Mexico should declare war against the United States and enlist Japan as an ally. This would prevent the United States from joining the Allies and deploying troops to Europe, and would give Germany more time for their unrestricted submarine warfare program to strangle Britain's vital war supplies. In return, the Germans would promise Mexico support in reclaiming Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.<ref>{{harvnb|Tuchman|1966}}</ref>

=====U.S. declaration of war on Germany=====
[[Image:USA bryter de diplomatiska f<U+00F6>rbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg||thumb|President Wilson before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917]]

After the British revealed the telegram to the United States, President Wilson, who had won reelection on his keeping the country out of the war, released the captured telegram as a way of building support for U.S. entry into the war. He had previously claimed neutrality, while calling for the arming of U.S. merchant ships delivering munitions to combatant Britain and quietly supporting the British blockading of German ports and mining of international waters, preventing the shipment of food from America and elsewhere to combatant Germany. After submarines sank seven U.S. merchant ships and the publication of the [[Zimmerman telegram]], Wilson called for war on Germany, which the [[U.S. Congress]] declared on 6 April 1917.<ref>see: [[wikisource:Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany|''Woodrow Wilson declares war on Germany'']].</ref> 

Crucial to U.S. participation was the sweeping domestic propaganda campaign executed by the [[Committee on Public Information]] overseen by [[George Creel]].<ref name="OverHere">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2004|pp=59-72}}</ref> The campaign included tens of thousands of government-selected community leaders giving brief carefully scripted pro-war speeches at thousands of public gatherings.{{harvnb|Ross|pp=244-6}} Along with other branches of government and private vigilante groups like the [[American Protective League]], it also included the general repression and harassment of people either opposed to American entry into the war or of German heritage.<ref name="OverHere" /> Other forms of propaganda included [[newsreels]], photos, large-print posters (designed by several well-known illustrators of the day, including [[Louis D. Fancher]] and [[Henry Reuterdahl]]), magazine and newspaper articles, etc.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{POV-statement|date=November 2009}}

=====First active U.S. participation=====
The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled "Associated Power". The United States had a small army, but it drafted four million men and by summer 1918 was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the U.S. Congress gave U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. Germany had miscalculated, believing it would be many more months before they would arrive and that the arrival could be stopped by U-boats.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilgus|p=52}}</ref>

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the [[British Grand Fleet]], [[destroyers]] to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], Ireland and [[submarines]] to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[U.S. Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted U.S. units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. The U.S. rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Force]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up U.S. units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow [[African-American]] combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, earning a unit [[Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood and Sechault.<ref>{{citation| publisher=[[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]]|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/| title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I| accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><!--

====German Spring Offensive of 1918====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}
[[Image:trencheswwi2.jpg|right|thumb|For most of World War I, Allied forces were stalled at trenches on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]]]

German General [[Erich Ludendorff]] drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U.S. forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Amiens]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60&nbsp;kilometres (40&nbsp;miles).<ref name="isbn0-7603-1937-5">{{harvnb|Westwell|2004}}</ref>

British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics, after General [[Oskar von Hutier]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.<ref>{{harvnb|Posen|1984|pp=190&ndash;1}}</ref>

The front moved to within 120&nbsp;kilometers (75&nbsp;mi) of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance.<ref>{{cite episode| series=Line of Fire| title=Kaiserschlacht 1918| network=The History Channel}}</ref> The sudden stop was also a result of the four [[Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) divisions that were "rushed" down, thus doing what no other army had done and stopping the German advance in its tracks. During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough.

American divisions, which Pershing had sought to field as an independent force, were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917.<ref name=moon/> [[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. Haig, Petain and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating role, rather than a directing role and the British, French and U.S. commands operated largely independently.<ref name=moon>{{harvnb|Moon|1996|pp=495&ndash;6}}</ref>

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive with limited territorial gains for Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl<U+00FC>cher and Yorck]], broadly towards Paris. Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, attempting to encircle [[Reims]] and beginning the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The resulting counterattack, starting the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked their first successful Allied offensive of the war.

By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines,<ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2007}}</ref> having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the war in the West, the German Army never again regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroops.

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches become frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was 53% of 1913 levels.

====New states under war zone====
In 1918, the internationally recognised [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] bordering the Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire were established, as well as the unrecognised [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]]. Later, these unrecognised states were eliminated by Azerbaijan and Turkey. {{further|[[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]}}

In 1918, the [[Dashnak]]s of the [[Armenian national movement|Armenian national liberation movement]] declared the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] (DRA) through the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians]] (unified form of [[Armenian National Council]]s) after the dissolution of the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. [[Tovmas Nazarbekian]] became the first Commander-in-chief of the DRA. Enver Pasha ordered the creation of a new army to be named the [[Ottoman Army of Islam|Army of Islam]]. He ordered the Army of Islam into the DRA, with the goal of taking [[Baku]] on the [[Caspian Sea]]. This new offensive was strongly opposed by the [[German Empire|Germans]]. In early May 1918, the Ottoman army attacked the newly declared DRA. Although the Armenians managed to inflict one defeat on the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Sardarapat]], the Ottoman army won a later battle and scattered the Armenian army. The Republic of Armenia signed the [[Treaty of Batum]] in June 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Swietochowski|2004}}</ref>

[[Image:Battle of St. Mihiel 03.jpg|thumb|U.S. engineers returning from the front during the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] in September 1918]]

The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918. The [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] developed with III Corps [[British Fourth Army|Fourth British Army]] on the left, the [[French First Army|First French Army]] on the right, and the [[Australian Corps|Australian]] and [[Canadian Corps]] spearheading the offensive in the centre through [[Harbonni<U+00E8>res]].<ref name="AWMAmiens">{{citation| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiens.htm|title=The Battle of Amiens: 8 August 1918| publisher=Australian War Memorial| accessdate=2008-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070617055415/http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiensmap.htm |title=Amiens Map |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=2009-10-24}} (archived 2007-06-17)</ref> It involved 414 [[tank]]s of the [[Mark I (tank)|Mark IV]] and [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V series|Mark V]] type, and 120,000 men. They advanced 12&nbsp;kilometers (7&nbsp;miles) into German-held territory in just seven hours. Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".<ref name="AWMAmiens" /><ref>{{harvnb|Rickard|2001}}</ref> 

The Australian-Canadian spearhead at Amiens, a battle that was the beginning of Germany<U+2019>s downfall,<ref name="Terraine-Victory">{{harvnb|Terraine|1963}}</ref> helped pull the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south forward. While German resistance on the [[British Fourth Army]] front at Amiens stiffened, after an advance as far as {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} and concluded the battle there, the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10&nbsp;August, when it was thrown in on the right of the [[French First Army]], and advanced {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16&nbsp;August. South of the French Third Army, General [[Charles Mangin]] (The Butcher) drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners, two hundred guns and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle.<ref name="Pitt-1918">{{harvnb|Pitt|2003}}</ref> Another "Black day" as described by Erich Ludendorff.

Meanwhile General Byng of the Third British Army, reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal, was ordered to attack with 200 tanks toward Bapaume, opening what is known as the battle of Albert with the specific orders of "To break the enemy's front, in order to outflank the enemies present battle front" (opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens).<ref name = "Terraine-Victory" /> Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives and it was better to turn a line than to try and roll over it. Attacks were being undertaken in quick order to take advantage of the successful advances on the flanks and then broken off when that attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name="Pitt-1918" />

The British Third Army's {{convert|15|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn.<ref>{{harvnb|Maurice|1918}}</ref> Rawlinson<U+2019>s [[Fourth British Army]] was able to battle its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time.<ref name="Pitt-1918" /> On 26&nbsp;August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle extending it northward to beyond Arras. The Canadian Corps already being back in the vanguard of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] fought their way from Arras eastward {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} astride the heavily defended Arras-Cambrai before reaching the outer defences of the Hindenburg line, breaching them on the 28 and 29&nbsp;August. Bapaume fell on the 29&nbsp;August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army and the Australians, still leading the advance of the Fourth Army, were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and Mont St. Quentin on 31&nbsp;August. Further south the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army, who had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames, was now near to the Alberich position of the [[Hindenburg line]].<ref name="Chron-FWW">{{harvnb|Gray|Argyle|1990}}</ref> During the last week of August the pressure along a {{convert|70|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, "Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines."<ref name="Pitt-1918" /> Even to the north in [[Flanders]] the British Second and Fifth Armies during August and September were able to make progress taking prisoners and positions that were previously denied them.<ref name="Chron-FWW"/>

[[Image:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [[observation balloon]] flying over territory near front lines.]]On 2 September the [[Canadian Corps]] outflanking of the [[Hindenburg line]], with the breaching of the Wotan Position, made it possible for the Third Army to advance and sent repercussions all along the Western Front. That same day [[Oberste Heeresleitung]] (OHL) had no choice but to issue orders to six armies for withdrawal back into the Hindenburg line in the south, behind the [[Canal Du Nord]] on the Canadian-First Army's front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north, giving up without a fight the salient seized in the previous April.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|1962}}</ref> According to [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] <U+201C>We had to admit the necessity<U+2026>to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.<U+201D><ref name="Ludendorff">{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919}}</ref>

In nearly four weeks of fighting since 8&nbsp;August over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the BEF and the rest by the French. Since "The Black Day of the German Army" the German High Command realised the war was lost and made attempts for a satisfactory end. The day after the battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." On 11&nbsp;August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it and replied, "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." On 13 August at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Chancellor and Foreign minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and on the following day the German Crown Council decided victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations, to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the Queen of Holland's mediation. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier." On 10&nbsp;September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria and Germany appealed to Holland for mediation. On the 14&nbsp;September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected and on 24&nbsp;September OHL informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.<ref name="Chron-FWW"/>

September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear guard actions and launching numerous counter attacks on lost positions, with only a few succeeding and then only temporarily. Contested towns, villages, heights and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the [[Hindenburg Line]] continued to fall to the Allies as well as thousands of prisoners, with the BEF alone taking 30,441 in the last week of September. Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army victory at Ivincourt on 12&nbsp;September, the Fourth Armies at Epheny on 18&nbsp;September and the French gain of [[Essigny-le-Grand]] a day later. On 24&nbsp;September a final assault by both the British and French on a four mi (6&nbsp;km) front would come within two miles (3&nbsp;km) of [[St. Quentin]].<ref name="Chron-FWW"/> With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg line. With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north the time had now come for an assault on the whole length of the line.

The Allied [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|attack on the Hindenburg Line]] began on 26&nbsp;September including U.S. soldiers. The still-green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape.<ref>{{harvnb|Jenkins|2009|p=215}}</ref> The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.<ref>{{harvnb|McLellan|p=49}}</ref>  The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent, which the Germans held as a pivot until Allied artillery was brought up.<ref>{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918b}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918a}}</ref> The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions.

When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29&nbsp;September, the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece. Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=380}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hull|2006|p=307-10}}</ref>

Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the "valour" of the German Navy. Knowing the government of [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at [[Kiel]]. Many rebelled and were arrested, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal. Ludendorff took the blame<U+2014>the Kaiser dismissed him on 26&nbsp;October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. The reserves had been used up, but U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=383}}</ref>

Having suffered over 6&nbsp;million casualties, Germany moved toward peace. [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] took charge of a new government as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] to negotiate with the Allies. Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that better terms would be offered than by the British and French. Instead Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser. There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic|social democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9&nbsp;November declared Germany to be a republic. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the Weimar Republic.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|ch=17}}</ref>

===Armistices and capitulations===

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice on 29 September 1918 at [[Saloniki]].<ref name = "indiana.edu-1918">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm|title=1918 Timeline}}</ref> On 30 October the [[Ottoman Empire]] capitulated at [[Mudros]].<ref name = "indiana.edu-1918"/>

On 24 October the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine and Trieste. On 3 November Austria<U+2013>Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[Armistice]]. The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian Commander and accepted. The [[Armistice of villa Giusti|Armistice with Austria]] was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg monarchy]].

Following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918<U+2013>19|German Revolution]], a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. The [[Kaiser]] fled to the Netherlands. On 11 November [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|an armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]]. At 11 a.m. on 11 November 1918&mdash;"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month"&mdash;a ceasefire came into effect. Opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions. Canadian Private [[George Lawrence Price]] is traditionally regarded as the last soldier killed in the Great War: he was shot by a German sniper at 10:57 and died at 10:58.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.nwbattalion.com/last.html| title=The Last Hours| The 28th (North-west) Battalion Canadian Corps}}</ref>

====Allied superiority and the stab-in-the-back legend, November 1918====
In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel; continuation of the war would have meant the invasion of Germany. Berlin was almost {{convert|900|mi|km}} from the Western Front; no Allied soldier had ever set foot on German soil in anger, and the Kaiser's armies retreated from the battlefield in good order, though up to a million of them were suffering from the [[Spanish Flu]] and unfit to fight. Hindenburgh and other senior German leaders spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated, resulting in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]].<ref>{{citation|author=Baker, Kevin| title=Stabbed in the Back! The past and future of a right-wing myth |periodical=Harper's Magazine|date=June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Chickering|2004|pp=185-188}}</ref>

A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. Later treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the [[Turkish Independence War]]) and a final peace treaty was signed between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]], at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]] on 24 July 1923.

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles treaty was signed in 1919; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally the last formal peace treaties were not signed until the Treaty of Lausanne. Under its terms, the Allied forces divested [[Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

==Technology==
{{See also|Technology during World War I|Weapons of World War I}}

[[Image:Armoured car.jpg|thumb|Armoured cars]]
The First World War began as a clash of twentieth century [[technology]] and ninteenth century [[military tactics|tactics]], with inevitably large casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of [[telephone]], [[Wireless|wireless communication]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|p=154}}</ref> [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]s, [[tanks]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=82&ndash;86}}</ref> and [[aircraft]]. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100&ndash;man companies were no longer the main unit of maneuver. Instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]]. [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilizing heavy indirect fire. She employed 150 and 210&nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s in 1914 when the typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105&nbsp;mm. The British had a 6&nbsp;[[inch]] (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be assembled for firing. Germans also fielded Austrian 305&nbsp;mm and 420&nbsp;mm guns, and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'' ideally suited for trench warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Mosier|2001|pp=42&ndash;48}}</ref>

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], where hundreds often died for each yard gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] was employed to provide the German forces with a constant supply of gunpowder, in the face of British naval blockade.<ref>{{harvnb|Harcup|1988}}</ref> Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|p=421}}</ref> and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head-wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel [[helmet]], led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and U.S. troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Few war casualties were caused by gas,<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens}}</ref> as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the 1907 Hague Conventions, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,<ref>{{harvnb|Heller|1984}}</ref> though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar, there were numerous pulp novels on future "gas wars", including ''Ghastly Dew'' ''The Gas War of 19--''.</ref>

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s weighing hundreds of tons apiece. These were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]]s, even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over 100&nbsp;kilometres (60&nbsp;mi), though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb). While the Allies had railway guns, German models severely out-ranged and out-classed them.

[[Image:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]].]]
[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914 the military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bombers]] were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|1991|pp=56&ndash;57}}</ref>

German [[U-boat]]s ([[submarines]]) were deployed after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, they were employed by the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] in a strategy to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of [[depth charges]] (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[Hunter-killer armored-vehicle team|hunter-killer]] submarines ([[British R class submarine|HMS ''R&ndash;1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref>{{harvnb|Price|1980}}</ref>  To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.

[[Image:Vickers IWW.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]].]]
Trenches, machineguns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability became an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds and showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Light [[Automatic firearm|automatic weapons]] also were introduced, such as the [[Lewis Gun]] and [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]].

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Winter|1983}}</ref> If there was an enemy air attack, the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output) and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb|Johnson|2001}}</ref> Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. [[File:Nieuport w Le Prieur rockets.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|right|Johnson's Nieuport 11 armed with [[Le Prieur rocket|Le Prieur]] rockets for attacking observation balloons]]To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. Blimps and balloons contributed to air-to-air combat among aircraft, because of their reconnaissance value, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines. The resulting panic took several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name=FullCircle /><ref>{{harvnb|Cross|1991}}</ref>

Another new weapon, [[flamethrower]]s, were first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, they were a powerful, demoralizing weapon and caused terror on the battlefield. It was a dangerous weapon to wield, as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for wheeled vehicles eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

===Genocide and ethnic cleansing===
====Ottoman Empire====
{{Main|Ottoman casualties of World War I}}
{{See also|Armenian Genocide|Assyrian Genocide|Greek genocide}}
The [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Ottoman Empire's [[Christian]] population, with the most prominent among them being the deportation and massacres of [[Armenians]] (similar policies were enacted against the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Ottoman Greeks]]) during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is considered [[genocide]].<ref name="IAGSletter">{{citation| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20071006024502/http://www.genocidewatch.org/TurkishPMIAGSOpenLetterreArmenia6-13-05.htm| author=[[International Association of Genocide Scholars]]| title=Open Letter to [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an]]| date=13 June 2005| publisher=[[Genocide Watch]] (via archive.org, archived 2007-10-06)}}</ref> The Ottomans saw the entire Armenian population as an [[Fifth column|enemy]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lewy|2005|p=57}}</ref> that had chosen to side with Russia at the beginning of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|2006|p=177}}</ref> In early 1915 a number of Armenian nationalist groups such as the [[Armenian Democratic Liberal Party|Armenakan]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] and [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party|Hunchak]] organizations joined the Russian forces, and the Ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the [[Tehcir Law]] which started the deportation of the Armenians from eastern Anatolia to Syria between 1915 and 1917. The exact number of deaths is unknown, although Balakian gives a range of 250,000 to 1.5 million for the deaths of Armenians,<ref>{{harvnb|Balakian|2003|pp=195&ndash;6}}</ref> the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] estimates over 1 million.<ref name="IAGSletter" /> The government of Turkey has consistently [[Denial of the Armenian Genocide|rejected]] charges of genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine or disease during the First World War.<ref>{{harvnb|Fromkin|1989|pp=212&ndash;5}}</ref>

===Rape of Belgium===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
In Belgium, German troops, in fear of French and Belgian guerrilla fighters, or ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', massacred townspeople in [[Andenne]] (211 dead), [[Tamines]] (384 dead), and [[Dinant]] (612 dead). On 25 August 1914, the Germans set fire to the town of [[Leuven]], burned the library containing about 230,000 books, killed 209 civilians and forced 42,000 to evacuate. These actions brought worldwide condemnation.<ref>{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=82&ndash;3}}</ref>

==Soldiers' experiences==
{{Main|Surviving veterans of World War I|World War I casualties|Commonwealth War Graves Commission|American Battle Monuments Commission}}

The soldiers of the war were initially volunteers, except for Italy, but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service.  Britain's [[Imperial War Museum]] has collected more than 2,500&nbsp;recordings of soldiers' personal accounts and selected transcripts, edited by military author [[Max Arthur]], have been published. The museum believes that historians have not taken full account of this material and accordingly has made the full archive of recordings available to authors and researchers.<ref>{{citation| last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=[[Forgotten Voices of the Great War]]| work=| publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|date=| url=http://www.forgottenvoices.co.uk/| format=| doi=| accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref> Surviving veterans, returning home, often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves. Grouping together, they formed "veterans' associations" or "Legions", as listed at [[:Category:Veterans' organizations]].

===Prisoners of war===
[[Image:Indian army soldier after siege of Kut q79446.jpg|thumb|This photograph shows an emaciated Indian Army soldier who survived the [[Siege of Kut]]]]
About 8 million men surrendered and were held in [[Pow camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Convention on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]]. A POW's rate of survival was generally much higher than their peers at the front.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillimore|Bellot|1919|pp=47&ndash;64}}</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon. Large units usually surrendered en masse. At the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000&nbsp;Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000&nbsp;Russians became prisoners. Over half of Russian losses were prisoners (as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed); for Austria 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5&ndash;3.5&nbsp;million men as prisoners.) From the Central Powers about 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|pp=368<U+2013>9}}</ref>

Germany held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.9&nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just prior to the Armistice. The U.S. held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.<ref>{{harvnb|Blair|2005}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Cook|2006|pp=637&ndash;65}}</ref> Once prisoners reached a camp, in general, conditions were satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. Conditions were terrible in Russia, [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15<U+2013>20% of the prisoners in Russia died. In Germany food was scarce, but only 5% died.<ref>{{harvnb|Speed|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|ch=13}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Morton|1992}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire often treated POWs poorly.<ref name="isbn0-691-09278-8">{{harvnb|Bass|2002|p=107}}</ref> Some 11,800 British Empire soldiers &mdash; most of them Indians &mdash; became prisoners after the [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916; 4,250 died in captivity.<ref>{{citation |publisher=British National Archives |title=The Mesopotamia campaign |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/battles/mesopotamia.htm |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>
Although many were in very bad condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march {{convert|1100|km|mi|0|sing=off}} to [[Anatolia]]. A survivor said: "we were driven along like beasts, to drop out was to die."<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/stolenyears/ww1/turkey/story2.asp| publisher=Australian War Memorial|work=Stolen Years: Australian Prisoners of War| title=Prisoners of Turkey: Men of Kut ''Driven along like beasts''| accessdate=2008-12-10 }}</ref> The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the [[Taurus Mountains]].

In Russia, where the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917 they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

===Military attach<U+00E9>s and war correspondents===
{{Main|Military attach<U+00E9>s and war correspondents in the First World War}}
Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war.  Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat like what is now termed "[[embedded journalist|embedded]]" positions within the opposing land and naval forces.  These military attach<U+00E9>s and other observers prepared voluminous first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers.

For example, former U.S. Army Captain [[Granville Roland Fortescue|Granville Fortescue]] followed the developments of the [[Gallipoli campaign]] from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders; and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York.<ref>{{harvnb|Fortescue|28 October 1915|p=1}}</ref> However, this observer's role was abandoned when the U.S. entered the war, as Fortescue immediately re-enlisted, sustaining wounds at [[Montfaucon d'Argonne]] in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], September 1918.<ref>{{citation| publisher=Arlington National Cemetery| url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/fortesc.htm| title=Granville Roland Fortescue| accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>
 
In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict.  This was the not first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important.  The [[Russo-Japanese War]] had been closely observed by Military attach<U+00E9>s, war correspondents and other observers; but, from a 21st Century perspective, it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War.<ref name="sizemore1">{{harvnb|Sisemore|2003}}</ref>

An early recorded use of the term "World War" is attributed to a well-known journalist for [[The Times|''The Times'']], Colonel [[Charles <U+00E0> Court Repington|Charles Repington]], who wrote in his diary on 10 September 1918: "We discussed the right name of the war. I said the we called it now ''The War'', but that this could not last. The Napoleonic War was ''The Great War.'' To call it ''The German War'' was too much flattery for the ''Boche''. I suggested ''The World War'' as a shade better title, and finally we mutually agreed to call it ''The First World War'' in order to prevent the millennium folk from forgetting that the history of the world was the history of war."<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|Epstein|2006|p=633}}</ref>

===Opposition to the war===
{{Main|Opposition to World War I|French Army Mutinies (1917)}}
[[Image:1917 - Execution <U+00E0> Verdun lors des mutineries.jpg|thumb|1917 - Execution at Verdun at the time of the mutinies]]
The [[trade union]] and [[socialism|socialist]] movements had long voiced their opposition to a war, which they argued, meant only that workers would kill other workers in the interest of [[capitalism]]. Once war was declared, however, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and individuals such as [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and their followers in Germany. There were also small anti-war groups in Britain and France. 

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the U.S. the 1917 [[Espionage Act]] effectively made free speech illegal and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic. The [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made any statements deemed "disloyal" a federal crime. Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors.<ref name = "Karp-PoW-1979"/>  

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s <U+2013> some socialist, some religious <U+2013> who refused to fight. In Britain 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.<ref name="isbn0-691-01232-6">{{harvnb|Lehmann|1999|p=62}}</ref> Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked "No conscientious objectors need apply". 

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.<ref>[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html Uzbeks]. Based on the Country Studies Series by Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.</ref> 

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies in the French army]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In September 1917 the [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.<ref>{{citation| title=With snow on their boots : The tragic odyssey of the Russian Expeditionary Force in France during World War 1| first=Jamie H| last=Cockfield| publisher=Palgrave Macmillan| year=1997| pages 171&ndash;237| isbn=0312220820}}</ref> In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees and helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for "bread, land, and peace". The Bolsheviks agreed a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions.

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, with his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, a diplomatic catastrophy.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106679/Charles-I#ref214141| title=Charles (I) (emperor of Austria)| work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica| accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{citation| last=Kurlander| first=Eric| year=2006 title=Steffen Bruendel.

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}
[[Image:1918 flu in Oakland.jpg|thumb|[[American Red Cross]] nurses tend to [[Spanish flu]] patients in temporary wards set up inside [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] Municipal Auditorium, 1918]]
No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically<U+2014>four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and the Russian. Four defunct dynasties, the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]]s, the [[Habsburg]], [[Romanov]]s and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]] together with all their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France with 1.4&nbsp;million soldiers dead, not counting other casualties. Germany and Russia were similarly affected. 

Of the 60&nbsp;million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914&ndash;1918, 8&nbsp;million were killed, 7&nbsp;million were permanently disabled, and 15&nbsp;million were seriously injured. Germany lost 15.1% of its active male population, Austria<U+2013>Hungary lost 17.1%, and France lost 10.5%.<ref>{{harvnb|Kitchen|2000|p=22}}</ref> About 750,000 German civilians died from [[starvation]] caused by the British blockade during the war.<ref>{{citation| quote=Die miserable Versorgung mit Lebensmitteln erreichte 1916/17 im "Kohlr<U+00FC>benwinter" einen dramatischen H<U+00F6>hepunkt.

===Peace treaties===
After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers. The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] officially ended the war. Building on Wilson's 14th point, the Treaty of Versaille also brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Magliveras|1999|pp=8&ndash;12}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Northedge|1986|pp=35&ndash;6}}</ref>

In signing the treaty, Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war, agreeing to pay enormous [[war reparations]] and award territory to the victors. The "Guilt Thesis" became a controversial explanation of events in Britain and the United States. The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the [[Nazi]]s, exploited with a [[conspiracy theory]] they called the [[Dolchstosslegende]]. The [[Weimar Republic]] lost the former [[German colonial empire|colonial possessions]] and was saddled with accepting blame for the war, as well as paying punitive [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for it. Unable to pay them with exports (a result of territorial losses and postwar recession),<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|1920}}</ref> Germany did so by borrowing from the United States, until runaway inflation in the 1920s, contributed to the economic collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]]. The reparations were suspended in 1931.  

Austria<U+2013>Hungary was also partitioned, largely along ethnic lines, into several successor states including Austria, Hungary, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Yugoslavia]], as well as adding [[Transylvania]] to the [[Greater Romania]] who was allied with the victors. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]], lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of [[Estonia]], Finland, [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it; [[Bessarabia]] was also re-attached to the [[Greater Romania]] as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1927}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-[[Anatolia]]n territory was awarded as protectorates of various Allied powers, while the remaining Turkish core was reorganised as the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres]] in 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish republican movement]], leading to the [[Turkish Independence War]] and, ultimately, to the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

===Social trauma===
{{Refimprove|section|date=January 2008}}
The social trauma caused by years of mass slaughter manifested itself in different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and its results, and so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world, supporting organisations such as the [[League of Nations]]. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and military might could be relied upon in a chaotic and inhumane world. [[Development criticism|Anti-modernist]] views were an outgrowth of the many changes taking place in society.

The experiences of the war led to a collective trauma for all participating countries. The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle <U+00C9>poque|la belle <U+00E9>poque]]'' was destroyed and those who fought in the war became known as the ''[[Lost Generation]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Roden}}</ref> For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.<ref>{{harvnb|Wohl|1979}}</ref> The soldiers returning home from World War I suffered greatly from the horrors they had witnessed. Many returning veterans suffered from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia).<ref>{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1085&ndash;6}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{Main|World War I in art and literature|Media of World War I|War memorials}}
The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities.

===Memorials===
[[Image:Beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial.jpg|thumb|The [[Beaumont Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]] in the Somme]]
Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, the improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]] and [[Le Souvenir fran<U+00E7>ais]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

[[Image:JohnMcCraeportrait.jpg|thumb|Surgeon Lt. Col. [[John McCrae]] of Canada, author of ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'', died in 1918 of [[pneumonia]].]]
On 3 May 1915, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed.  At his graveside, his friend [[John McCrae]], M.D., of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], Canada wrote the memorable poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. Published in [[Punch Magazine|''Punch'']] on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on [[Armistice Day|Remembrance Day]] and [[Memorial Day]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10200 |title=John McCrae |publisher=Historica }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&ArticleId=A0004849 |author=Evans David |title=John McCrae |work=Canadian Encyclopedia}}</ref>

===Later conflicts===
The end of World War I set the stage for other world conflicts, some of which are continuing into the 21st century. The [[Bolshevik]]s, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], pushed for socialist revolution. 

===Discontent in Germany===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstosslegende'') was a testament to the [[Mental health|psychological state]] of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This [[conspiracy theory]] of betrayal became common and the German public came to see themselves as victims. The ''Dolchstosslegende'''s popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism. A sense of disillusionment and [[cynicism]] became pronounced, with [[nihilism]] growing in popularity. This disillusionment for humanity found a cultural climax with the [[Dada]]ist [[Art movement|artistic movement]]. Many believed the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war.Out of German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity and power.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml| publisher=BBC| title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/hitlergainspower.htm| title=The Rise of Hitler| accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> [[World War II]] was in part a continuation of the power struggle that was never fully resolved by the First World War; in fact, it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II| title=World War II| work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia| accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref>

===New national identities===
Poland reemerged as an independent country, after more than a century. [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] were entirely new nations agglomerating previously independent peoples. Russia became the [[Soviet Union]] and lost [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], which became independent countries. The Ottoman Empire was soon replaced by [[Turkey]] and several other countries in the Middle East.

In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]]. [[Anzac Day]], commemorating the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]], celebrates this defining moment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9400E1DD113FE233A25755C2A9629C946796D6CF&scp=12&sq=New+Zealand+anzac&st=p |title='ANZAC Day' in London; King, Queen, and General Birdwood at Services in Abbey |publisher=New York Times |date=26 April 1916}}</ref><ref name=awmtradition>
{{citation| url=http://www.awm.gov.au/commemoration/anzac/anzac_tradition.asp| title=The ANZAC Day tradition| publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]]| accessdate=2008-05-02}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], where the Canadian divisions fought together for the first time as a single corps, Canadians began to refer to theirs as a nation "forged from fire".<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/vimy-ridge-e.aspx| publisher=Canadian War Museum| title=Vimy Ridge  |accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref>  Having succeeded on the same battleground where the "mother countries" had previously faltered, they were for the first time respected internationally for their own accomplishments.  Canada entered the war as a Dominion of the British Empire and remained so afterwards, although she emerged with a greater measure of independence.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/guerre/war-impact-e.aspx| title=The War's Impact on Canada| publisher=Canadian War Museum| accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2008/05/09/babcock-citizen.html| title=Canada's last WW1 vet gets his citizenship back| publisher=CBC News| date=2008-05-09}}</ref>  While the other Dominions were represented by Britain, Canada was an independent negotiator and signatory of the [[Versailles Treaty]].

===Macro- and micro-economic effects===
One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, new government ministries and powers were created. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many of which have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of the formerly large and bureaucratised governments such as in Austria<U+2013>Hungary and Germany; however, any analysis of the long-term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.

[[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the main three Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most of the pigs were slaughtered and, at war's end, there was no meat.

All nations had increases in the government's share of GDP, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching fifty percent in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans, which, in part, were funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid.

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war.  Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost laborers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].

As the war slowly turned into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], [[conscription]] was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia. In the former it opened a political gap between French-Canadians&mdash;who claimed their true loyalty was to Canada and not the British Empire&mdash;and the [[English language|Anglophone]] majority who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada. Prime Minister [[Sir Robert Borden|Robert Borden]] pushed through a [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]], provoking the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by Prime Minister [[William Morris Hughes|Billy Hughes]], caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]] and Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Nevertheless, the [[labour movement]], the [[Catholic Church]], and [[Irish republican|Irish nationalist]] expatriates successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and [[Margarine|oleo]]), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917<U+2013>18 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays and inadequate housing. Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man, six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.<ref>{{harvnb|Havighurst|1985|p=131}}</ref>

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. Geologists, such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]], were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].<ref>{{harvnb|Green|1938|pp=CXXVI}}</ref>

==Cognate names for the war==

Before World War II, the war was also known as ''The Great War'', ''The World War'', ''The War to End All Wars'', ''The Kaiser's War'', ''The War of the Nations'' and ''The War in Europe''. In France and Belgium it was sometimes referred to as ''La Guerre du Droit'' (''the War for Justice'') or ''La Guerre Pour la Civilisation'' / ''de Oorlog tot de Beschaving'' (''the War to Preserve Civilization''), especially on medals and commemorative monuments.

The term used by official histories of the war in Britain and Canada is ''The First World War'', while American histories generally use the term ''World War I''.

The earliest known use of the term ''First World War'' appeared during the war. German biologist and philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote shortly after the start of the war:

{{quote|There is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.<ref>{{harvnb|Shapiro|2006|p=329}}</ref>|''[[Indianapolis Star]], 20 September 1914''}}

The term was used again near the end of the war. English journalist [[Charles <U+00E0> Court Repington|Charles A. Repington]] wrote:

{{quote|I saw Major Johnstone, the Harvard Professor who is here to lay the bases of an American History. We discussed the right name of the war. I said that we called it now The War, but that this could not last. The Napoleonic War was The Great War. To call it The German War was too much flattery for the Boche. I suggested The World War as a shade better title, and finally we mutually agreed to call it The First World War in order to prevent the millennium folk from forgetting that the history of the world was the history of war.<ref>{{harvnb|Repington|1920|p=391}}</ref>|''The First World War, 1914-1918 (1920), Volume I, Page 391.''}}
