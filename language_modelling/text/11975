'''Natural predictive dialing''' is a technology that was developed to eliminate the problems that are typically associated with [[Predictive dialer|predictive dialing]].  These problems include abandoned calls, initial call delays, government regular, consumer dissatisfaction, and host of other problems.<ref name="Patent Number 7,734,029">{{cite web|last=Ryskamp|first=Rix|title=Patent Number 7,734,029|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=7,734,029.PN.&OS=PN/7,734,029&RS=PN/7,734,029|publisher=United States Patent Office}}</ref>

Unlike other types of [[dialer]]s, natural predictive dialers insert agents before the automation component of the dialer (such as call progress analysis) has completed.  For example, a standard [[predictive dialer]] will (1) first determine if a live person has answered the phone call and then (2) transfer that call to agent that is deemed to be available to take the call.  Conversely, natural predictive dialers connect the agent prior to the completion of the automation process, which allows the agent to hear the called party say "hello" while the automation is still working.

At its core, natural predictive dialing technologies are based on the concept that call automation should work with agents instead of call automation works before agents are connected and then connecting agents to calls that have been determined to be 'live' people.  In natural predictive dialing the call automation (sometimes called [[Call progress analysis|Call Progress Analysis]] (CPA)) can work before during or after an agent has interfaced with a call.<ref name="Call Progress Analysis">{{cite web|last=Cisco Systems|title=Call Progress Analysis|url=http://www.cisco.com/image/gif/paws/111980/cpa-00.pdf|publisher=Cisco}}</ref>  This interweaving of automation and human agents provides productivity increases traditionally associated with automation technologies while working to eliminate the unnatural affect that many call automation technologies have on the human-interaction aspects of the call.<ref name="Call Comparison Video" />

== Benefits ==
The core benefit of natural predictive dialing is the more pleasant human interactions that occur during calls that are actually being made by an automated system connected to agents.  In natural predictive dialing, the agents hear the called party say "hello" and can respond accordingly.<ref name="How Natural Predictive Works Video">{{cite web|title=How Natural Predictive Works Video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHd4qKlbSBw&context=C3f84b7cADOEgsToPDskIYYy0zdZfKQqYFHdcnA1v1|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>  The technology works well on small and large scales (one user up to thousands).  Contact centers that require a natural calling experience and wish to also have the productivity benefits associated with predictive dialing can utilize this technology to obtain both benefits.<ref name="Call Comparison Video">{{cite web|title=Call Comparison Video|url=http://www.cisco.com/image/gif/paws/111980/cpa-00.pdf|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

== Drawbacks ==
The only commercially available natural predictive dialer is provided by a single vendor.<ref name="Natural Contact Website">{{cite web|title=Natural Contact Website|url=http://www.naturalcontact.com|publisher=Transcend Products}}</ref>  Additionally, patents protecting the technology make it more expensive than many other systems, such as those available for free based on the [[Asterisk]] platform.  Many contact centers and other organizations don't necessarily need the 
benefits associated with the natural predictive dialing technology and can save money by using a more inexpensive or less-proprietary system.
