The '''Chase XCG-20''', also known as the '''XG-20''' and by the company designation '''MS-8 Avitruc''',<ref name= "BG">Gunston 1980, p. 170.</ref> was a large [[assault glider]] developed immediately after [[World War II]] by the [[Chase Aircraft Company]] for the United States Air Force, and was the largest glider ever built in the United States. The XG-20 did not see production due to a change in USAF requirements, however, it was modified into the successful [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] twin-engined transport aircraft which saw extensive service in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name= "BG"/>

==Design and development==
Following the end of the Second World War, the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which became the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) in 1948, developed a requirement for a new, large assault glider type to replace smaller types that were then in service, all existing gliders having been declared obsolete. <ref name="War1">Noetzel 1992, p.27.</ref> The new gliders were to be constructed entirely of metal, and were also required to be easily adaptable to a powered configuration.<ref name="War1"/> As part of a five-year development program,<ref name="War1"/> a contract was awarded to the Chase Aircraft Company of Trenton, New Jersey, in August 1946 for the construction of two types of gliders.<ref name="AiA"/> These included a smaller model being designated [[Chase YC-122 Avitruc|XCG-18A]], and the larger, definitive model being designated XCG-20.<ref name="DP">Pattillo 2000, p.165.</ref>

The XCG-20, redesignated XG-20 in 1948 with the establishment of the USAF, was the largest glider ever constructed in the United States, and the last combat glider to be built for the United States military.<ref name="BS">Sergievsky et. al. 1998, p.128</ref> It featured a high-mounted wing and retractable tricycle landing gear, with an [[auxiliary power unit]] supplied hydraulic power to the landing gear and flaps.<ref name="AiA"/> The nose section was reinforced to provide optimal protection to the pilots in the event of a crash on landing, and to allow for the strongest possible towing connection.<ref name="AiA">Adcock 1992, p.4.</ref> The cargo hold was {{convert|30|ft}} long and {{convert|12|ft}} wide;<ref name="AiA"/> it featured an innovative configuration, the rear fuselage being upswept with a integrated loading ramp.<ref name="DP"/> This allowed vehicles to be driven directly on and off of the aircraft, speeding loading and unloading times.<ref name="DP"/>

==Operational history==
Although the first prototype XG-20 never flew as a glider, the second prototype conducted the aircraft's first flight in April 1950.<ref>Noetzel 1992, p.28.</ref> Following being displayed to the public at [[Pope Air Force Base]] during [[Exercise Swarmer]] during that month,<ref>Shrader 1953, p.136.</ref> the XG-20 underwent thorough flight testing; during the late summer, it was evaulated against a variety of other transport aircraft at [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida.<ref>Aviation Week, October 23, 1950, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=hWc6TbriLcL58Abcrp3OCg&ct=result&id=HCtQAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22G-20%22+evaluation+Chase&q=%22G-20%22#search_anchor pp.11-12.]</ref><ref>"Assault Transport Tests Staged at Eglin Field". Fort Walton Beach, Florida ''Playground News'', September 7 1950. Vol. 5, Num. 32. p.1</ref> Although it possessed no obvious faults, the test program confirmed that the powered "assault transport" was the equal of the glider in landing performance;<ref>"Race for Superiority: Giant Transports to Get Eglin Suitability Tests", Fort Walton Beach, Florida ''Playground News'', August 17 1950. Vol. 5, Num. 29. p.9.</ref> having been rendered obsolete, the assault glider fell out of favor with the Air Force, and the XG-20 project was cancelled.<ref>Mitchell 1992, p.164.</ref> 

However, Chase had designed the aircraft to allow for the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two [[radial engine|radial]] piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports.<ref name="And">Andrade 1979, p. 87.</ref> Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for [[General Electric J47]] turbojets, becoming the [[Chase XC-123A|XC-123A]], the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.<ref name="AiA2">Adcock 1992, p.7.</ref>
