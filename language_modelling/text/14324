'''Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon''' (<U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D4><U+05DD> <U+05D1><U+05DF> <U+05E8><U+05DE><U+05D1>"<U+05DD>; also known as '''Rabbeinu Avraham ben ha-Rambam''', and '''Avraham Maimuni''') (1186 &ndash; December 7, 1237) was the son of [[Maimonides]] who succeeded his father as [[Nagid]] of the [[Egypt]]ian Jewish community.

==Biography==
{{see|History of the Jews in Egypt}}

Avraham was born in [[Fostat]], Egypt - his father, Maimonides, was fifty-one years old then. The boy was "modest, highly refined and unusually good natured"; he was also noted for his brilliant [[intellect]] and even while a youth became known as a great scholar. When his father died in 1204 at the age of sixty-nine, and Avraham was only nineteen,<ref>''Abraham Maimonides' Wars of the Lord and the Maimonidean controversy'', ed. Jacob Israel Dienstag, Fred Rosner - 2000 "His son Abraham stood at his bedside until his father's death when, at the young age of nineteen, he succeeded his father"</ref> Avraham was recognised as the greatest scholar in his community. Thus, he succeeded ''Rambam'' as ''Nagid'' (head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian Jews]]), as well as in the office of court [[physician]], at the age of only eighteen. (The office of ''nagid'' was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the 14th century). Rabbi Avraham greatly honored the memory of his father, and defended his writings and works against all critics. Thanks to his influence, a large Egyptian [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community returned to the fold of Rabbinic Judaism.

==Works==
Avraham Maimuni's best known work is his ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'' ("The Book of the Wars for God"), in which he answers the critics of [[Maimonides#Philosophy|his father's philosophical doctrines]] expressed in the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]''. He had initially avoided entering the controversy over his father's writings, however, when he heard of the alleged burning of his father's books in [[Montpellier]] in 1235, he compiled ''Milchamot HaShem'' which he addressed to the [[Hachmei Provence]]. His principal work is originally composed in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and entitled "<U+05DB><U+05EA><U+05D0><U+05D1> <U+05DB><U+05E4><U+05D9><U+05D0> <U+05D0><U+05DC><U+05E2><U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05D3><U+05D9><U+05DF>" ''Kit<U+0101>b Kif<U+0101>yah al-`<U+0100>bid<U+012B>n'' ("A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's ''Guide for the Perplexed''. In the book, Maimuni evinces a great appreciation of and affinity for [[Sufism]] (Islamic [[mysticism]]). Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of [[pietism]] for at least a century, and he is righlty considered the founder of this pietistic school.

His other works include a [[Bible commentary|commentary]] on the [[Torah]] in of which only his commentaries on ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'' and ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' are now extant, as well as commentaries on parts of his father's ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and on various tractates of the [[Talmud]]. He also wrote a work on ''[[Halakha]]'' (Jewish law), combined with [[philosophy]] and [[ethics]] (also in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and arranged after his father's ''[[Mishne Torah]]''). His "Discourse on the Sayings of the Rabbis" -  discussing ''[[aggadah]]'' - is often quoted.

He also authored various [[medical]] works.
