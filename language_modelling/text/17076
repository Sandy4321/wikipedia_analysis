The '''Battle of Gythium''' was fought in  195 BC between Sparta and the coalition of Rome, Rhodes, the Achean League and Pergamum. As the port of Gythium was an important Spartan base the allies decided to capture it before they advanced inland to Sparta. The Romans and the Acheans were joined outside the city by the Pergamese and Rhodian fleets. The Spartans held out but Dexagoridas decided to surrender the city to the Roman [[legate]] but when Gorgopas found out he killed his fellow commander and took solo command of the city. After Dexagoridas' murder the Spartans held out more vigouresly. However Flaminius arrived with 4,000 more men and the Spartans decided to surrender the city on the condition that the garrison could leave unharmed. The result of this battle forced [[Nabis]], the [[tyrant]] of Sparta decided to abandon the surounding land and with draw to the city of Sparta. Later that year Sparta capitulated to the allies.

==Prelude==

The Macedonian had been defeat in the [[Second Macedonian War]] in 197 BC which left the Spartan in control of [[Argos]]. This Spartan gain was bad for the Achean League who had been trying to incorperate Sparta into their league for many years. The Romans had won the Second Macedonian War and it left them in control of Greek affairs. However they decided not to occupy Greece but to garrison some cities for five years.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> The tyrant of Sparta, Nabis who had declared himself king was troubling the Achean League and was also threatening to destroy the peace in Greece.

In 195, Flaminius summoned his army in Greece and that of his allies at [[Plataea]] in [[Boeotia]]. He then marched from Plataea to Argos where he was joined by 10,000 Achean infantry and 1,000 cavalry.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> After a few brief skirmishes the allies decided to abandon the siege and they pitched in [[Tegea]].<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> They then advance upon [[Caryae]] where they were joined by 1,500 Mcedonians and 400 [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] cavalry. <ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref>

Nabis also made his own preparation. He summoned 1,000 picked [[warriors]] from [[Crete]], as well as 3,000 mercenries and 10,000 citizens.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> The Romans and their allies then advanced upon [[Sellasia]] not far north of Sparta. The Roman were defeated in a small battle and they retreated.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> The Romans then won another battle against the Spartans and forced them to retreat into the city.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref>

==Battle==

Some coastal cities surrendered to the Romans which allowed the Romans to have a base in the coastal regions of [[Laconia]].<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> Gythium was the a large city and the Spartans naval base. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> The Roman siege engines had devastating effects on the walls.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> One of the cities joint commanders, Dexagoridas offered to surrender the city to the Roman [[legate]] in charge of the fleet while Flamninius was gone.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> When the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref>

Now with the city under Gorgopas' command the defenders became revigourated. The siege was proving more difficult until Flaminius arrived with 4,000 Roman soldiers.<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> With the new soldiers, the allied soldiers were revigourated. The Spartans knew that they did not have much of a chance of withstanding the renewed allied assualt and Gorgopas decided to surrender the city to the Romans under the condition that the garrison was allowed to leave the city unharmed.<ref> Livy.

==Aftermath==

When Nabis found out that Gythium had fallen to the allies he decided to abandon the remaining Laconian countryside that he controlled. Nabis sent envoys to Flaminius who offered Nabis a [[parley]].<ref> Livy. Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> The Romans attacked Sparta when the parley ended but the Spartans withstood the initial allied assualts but Nabis agreed to surrender the city to the Romans.<ref> Livy.

Rome and the Mediterranean.</ref> However the Romans didn't strip Nabis of his powers because they wanted a state in the [[Peloponnese]] to counter the growing Achean League. Nabis recaptured Gythium two to three years later but he was assassainated by the [[Aetolians|Aetolian League]] in 192.<ref> Livy.
