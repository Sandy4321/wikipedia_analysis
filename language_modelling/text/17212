The '''''Infante''''' was a 18-gun brig of the Spanish Navy, built in 1787 at Cadiz. The French Navy captured her in December 1793 and and recommissioned her as '''''Salamine'''''. In June 1799, {{HMS|Emerald|1795|6}} captured her and she was brought into Royal Navy service as '''HMS ''Salamine'''''. She served briefly in the Mediterranean, where she captured two French privateers and several merchant vessels before the Royal Navy sold her at Malta in 1802, after the [[Treaty of Amiens]] ended the [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with France]].

==French service==
The French navy captured the Spanish brig ''Infante'' in December 1793, and brought into French service under her existing name.<ref name="roche402" /> In January 1794, she was recommissioned in Toulon under Lieutenant Girardias,<ref name="fonds184">Fonds Marine, p.184</ref> and renamed ''Libert<U+00E9>''.<ref name="roche402" /> In May 1795, she was returned to her original name of ''Infante''.<ref name="roche402" />

In June 1797, ''Infante'' sailed together with the frigates [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']] and [[French frigate Art<U+00E9>mise (1794)|''Art<U+00E9>mise'']] to seize Venetian ships;<ref name="roche402" /> the prizes included the frigates [[French frigate Muiron|''Muiron'']] and [[HMS Carrere (1801)|''Carr<U+00E8>re'']].

On 10 May 1798, she was renamed to ''Salamine''.<ref name="roche402" /> As part of the fleet of Toulon, ''Salamine'' participated in the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798]]. 

During the [[Battle of the Nile]], she took refuge under the forts of [[Abu Qir Bay|Abukir]], and formed up with Rear-admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]]'s squadron, which comprised the two 74-gun [[HMS Malta (1800)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and [[French ship G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>reux (1785)|''G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>reux'']], and the frigates [[French frigate Diane (1796)|''Diane'']] and [[French frigate Justice (1794)|''Justice'']]. Villeneuve then entrusted ''Salamine'' with the report of the battle for General Bonaparte, before sailing to Malta with his four ships.<ref>Lecomte, vol.2, p.367</ref>

In May 1799, ''Salamine'' encountered the [[xebec]] [[French xebec Fortunatus|''Fortunatus'']] and recaptured her.<ref name="roche402" />{{#tag:ref|''Fortunatus'' was originally a British privateer, captured by [[French frigate Justice (1794)|''Justice'']] in December 1797. The French commissioned her as an 18-gun xebec; before ''Salamine'' recaptured her, she had been captured by [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']].<ref>Roche, p.208-209.</ref>|group=Note}}

Under Lieutenant [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Timoth<U+00E9>e Landry|Landry]]<ref name=roche402>Roche, p.420</ref><ref name=james263>James ([http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Naval_History/Vol_II/P_263.html vol.2 p.263])</ref> ''Salamine'' was part of the Syrian naval station under Rear-admiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr<U+00E9>e|Perr<U+00E9>e]].<ref name="fonds230">Fonds Marine, p.230</ref> She ferried artillery and ammunition to the French Army besieging [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]]'s squadron chased Perr<U+00E9>e's division, but it evaded him and sailed for Toulon.<ref name=troude-3-164>Troude, vol.3, p.164</ref>

Sixty miles off Toulon, on 17 June, Perr<U+00E9>e's division met [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]]'s fleet, who dispatched a force consisting of three [[Seventy-four (ship)|74-gun]] ships and two frigates, all under Captain [[John Markham (Royal Navy officer)|John Markham]], to intercept it. 

In weak winds, a 28-hour chase began, and the French division dispersed. By the evening of the 18th, ''Alerte'' was racing ahead, ''Salamine'' following three miles behind, and the French frigates four miles further behind her. At 19:00, the British 74-guns had subdued the frigates and Markham's force started chasing the two remaining brigs. The frigate {{HMS|Emerald|1795|6}} eventually caught up with ''Salamine'', which [[striking the colours|struck]] to her much stronger opponent.<ref name="fonds230" /><ref name=troude-3-164>Troude, vol.3, p.164</ref> The entire British squadron, not just the vessels under Markham's command, shared in the prize money.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15162|startpage=741|date=23 July 1799}}</ref> 

{{main|Action of 18 June 1799}}

At the time of her capture, ''Salamine'' was under the command of "Sandry, Lieutenant", presumably a misprint for "Landry".<ref name=LG15162>{{London Gazette|issue=15260|startpage=526|date=24 May 1800}}</ref>

==British service==

The Royal Navy commissioned ''Salamine'' in January 1800 under Commander Thomas Briggs.<ref name=Winfield/> He immediately took her out on patrol off the coast of Spain and France.

Her first prize was actually a share in a prize. On 29 March, ''Salamine'' was among the ships that shared in the capture of the ''Courageux''. The other captors were {{HMS|Renown|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Dragon|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Gibraltar|1780|2}}, ''Haerlem'', {{HMS|Alexander|1778|2}}, {{HMS|Athenian|1800|2}}, {{HMS|Mercury|1779|2}}, and ''Salamine''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15809|startpage=694|date=21 May 1805}}</ref>

On 9 April ''Salamine'' captured a Genoese [[Settee (sail)|settee]] that was sailing from [[Languedoc]] to Nolle [sic] with a cargo of wine. (This may have been the ''Madona del Fortuno''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15820|startpage=851|date=29 June 1805}}</ref>) Then two days later ''Salamine'' captured the French [[Tartane|tartan]], the ''Madona de Montenero'', which was carrying salt fish, sugar, and similar cargo.<ref name=LG15278>{{London Gazette|issue=15278|startpage=843|endpage=844|date=22 July 1800}}</ref> 

The next month, on 3 May, ''Salamine'' captured the Swedish brig ''Waragtigheten'', which was sailing from [[Benicarl<U+00F3>]] to [[Livorno|Leghorn]] with a cargo of wine.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|startpage=1169|date=11 October 1800}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The date of capture was later corrected to 3 May from March, and the master's name was given as Wallenstein.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15874|startpage=1600|date=21 December 1805}}</ref>|group=Note}} About six weeks later, on 14 June, ''Salamine'' and {{HMS|Cameleon|1795|2}} captured the Genoese brig ''Anima Purgatoria'', which was sailing from [[Bastia]] to Saleolight [sic].<ref name=LG15278/>

On 20 August ''Salamine'' captured an unnamed French privateer of four guns, six [[swivel gun]]s, and 56 men.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15358|startpage=446|date=25 April 1801}}</ref> Then on the day after Christmas, ''Salamine'' and the frigate {{HMS|Caroline|1795|2}} captured the French brig ''Good Friends'', which was carrying a particularly militarily useful cargo of 28 brass long guns, five brass mortars, and shot and shell from Leghorn to Marseilles.<ref name=LG15428>{{London Gazette|issue=15428|startpage=1384|date=17 November 1801}}</ref> 

A little more than three weeks later, on 21 January 1801, ''Caroline'' and ''Salamine'' captured another French privateer, or judging from her crew size, more properly, a [[letter of marque]]. This was a xebec of four 6-pounder guns and 24 men. She was sailing from Leghorn to Egypt carrying arms and ammunition.<ref name=LG15428/> 

''Salamine'' served off Egypt between 8 March and 2 September. She is listed amongst the vessels whose crews qualified for the NGSM with clasp "Egypt".<ref>Long (1895), pp.112-3.</ref> Commander Alexander Campbell replaced Briggs in July, though Briggs is the captain named in the medal list.

==Fate==
''Salamine'' was paid off in July 1802. She was sold off later that year at Malta for <U+00A3>1,280.<ref name=Winfield/>
