'''Francisco Antonio Pascual de la Ascensi<U+00F3>n Ruiz de Tagle y Portales''' (c. 1790 - March 23, 1860) was a [[Chile]]an [[political figure]]. In 1830, he was briefly president of the country. Provisional President of Republic of Chile elected by Congress. 

He was born in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]; the son of [[Manuel Ruiz de Tagle y Jaraquemada]] and of [[Mar<U+00ED>a del Rosario Portales Larra<U+00ED>n]]. In his youth and according to the social norms of the time, he also became a militia officer in the "''Regimiento del Principe''" (Prince's regiment). He married [[Rosario Larra<U+00ED>n|Rosario Larra<U+00ED>n Rojas]] and had nine children.

The son of a royalist family, he was a tepid participant in the [[Chilean War of Independence]], specially during the period of the first Government Juntas. After the [[Battle of Maipu]], he became an ardent independentist and joined the Conservative party. Since 1811, he represented [[Los Andes, Chile|Los Andes]] in parliament. From 1812 to 1814, he served as senator and president of parliament, and in 1814, he became councilman and mayor of the municipality of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and became the provincial governor on February 13, 1817. He was a member of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1811)|Government Junta]], as a deputy.  In 1822, became superintendent of police of Santiago. He was [[Finance Ministry of Chile|Finance Minister]] under Vice President [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]], from July 28, 1828 to July 16, 1829. 

In the course of events leading to the [[Chilean Civil War of 1829]], he was part of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1829)|Government Junta]]. The junta nominated him as candidate for the following presidential election and Congress elected him as ''Provisional President'' on February 17, 1830, by imposition of [[Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Rodr<U+00ED>guez Aldea]], head of the O'Higgins party. Immediately that Ruiz-Tagle took over as president, the principal leaders of the liberal side ([[Manuel Borgo<U+00F1>o]], [[Francisco de la Lastra]] and [[Juan Gregorio de las Heras]]) were eliminated from the army roosters. This guaranteed the restart of the hostilities.

[[Diego Portales]], cousin to Ruiz-Tagle, maneuvered to have the president removed. President Ruiz-Tagle and all the cabinet resigned only six weeks later on March 31, claiming health problems, and [[Jos<U+00E9> Tom<U+00E1>s Ovalle]], as vice president assumed power on April 1. Under the administration of [[Manuel Bulnes]], Ruiz-Tagle was nominated as [[privy council]]. He died on the Chacra Lo Matta of Las Condes on March 23, 1860.
