[[Image:Downtown Idaho Springs, CO IMG 5437.JPG|200px|left|thumb|A glimpse of downtown Idaho Springs]]
The '''City of Idaho Springs''' is a municipality in the U.S. state of Colorado that is the most populous settlement in [[Clear Creek County, Colorado|Clear Creek County]], Colorado. Idaho Springs is located in [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek Canyon]], in the mountains upstream from [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], some thirty miles west of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Local legend is that the name of the city derived from annual visits to the radium hot springs made by an "Indian" (Native American) chief and his tribe who journeyed there each year from Idaho to bathe in the magic healing waters.

Founded in 1859 by prospectors during the early days of the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]], the town was at the center of the region's mining district throughout the late nineteenth century. The [[Argo Tunnel]] drained and provided access to many lodes of ore between Idaho Springs and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]]. During the late twentieth century, the town evolved into a tourist center along [[U.S. Route 6 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 6]] and [[U.S. Highway 40 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 40]], which ascend Clear Creek Canyon through the historic mining district.

The town today is squeezed along the north side of [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], with a historical downtown on its western end and a strip of tourist-related businesses on its eastern end. It also serves as a [[bedroom community]] for workers at the [[Loveland Ski Area]] farther up the canyon. The town today is the largest community in Clear Creek County, but, for historical reasons, the county seat has remained at [[Georgetown, Colorado|Georgetown]].

==History==
[[File:Miner Street Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|The Miner Street Bridge is one of nine sites in Idaho Springs listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Clear Creek County, Colorado|National Register of Historic Places]]]]
On January 5, 1859, during the [[Colorado gold rush]], prospector George A. Jackson discovered placer gold at the present site of Idaho Springs, where [[Chicago Creek (Colorado)|Chicago Creek]] empties into [[Clear Creek (Colorado)|Clear Creek]]. It was the first substantial gold discovery in Colorado. Jackson, a [[Missouri]] native with experience in the California gold fields, was drawn to the area by clouds of steam rising from some nearby [[hot spring]]s. Jackson kept his find secret for several months, but after he paid for some supplies with gold dust, others rushed to Jackson's diggings.<ref>Robert L. Brown (1985) ''The Great Pikes Peak Gold Rush'', Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, p.26-32.</ref> The location was originally known as "Jackson's Diggings." Once the location became a permanent settlement, it was variously called "Sacramento City," "Idahoe," "Idaho City," and finally "Idaho Springs."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=106:3:3594750213174340::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:204710%2CIdaho%20Springs|title= US Geological Survey, Geographic Names Information System|accessdate= 10 January 2009}}</ref>

The first placer discoveries were soon followed by discoveries of gold veins in the rocks of the canyon walls on both sides of Clear Creek. [[Hard rock mining]] became the mainstay of the town long after the gold-bearing gravels were exhausted.

A strike by Idaho Springs miners demanding the [[eight-hour day]] in May 1903 erupted into violence. This was a local struggle in a much broader fight called the [[Colorado Labor Wars]].

The 1969 film ''[[Downhill Racer]]'', portrayed an [[Alpine skiing|alpine ski racer]] from Idaho Springs, played by [[Robert Redford]]; a brief scene was shot on location in Idaho Springs. Several scenes from the comedy film ''[[The Overbrook Brothers]]'' were filmed here in the spring of 2008.
