'''''Speleonectes atlantida''''' is a species of eyeless [[crustacean]] in the order [[Nectiopoda]]. It was discovered in [[August 2009]] in the [[Tunnel de la Atlantida]], the world's longest submarine [[lava tube]] on [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands]] off the west coast of North Africa. The species is equipped with powerful [[prehensile]] [[arthropod leg|limbs]] and [[venom]]ous fangs that function as [[hypodermic needle]]s&nbsp;<ref name="SD"/>.

==Description==
''Speleonectes atlantida'' is approximately {{convert|20|mm|in}} long. Like most other remipedes, the species lacks eyes and is [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]. Adapted to life in caves, the long [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] sprouting from its head and the presence of sensory hairs along its body allow the crustacean to feel its way along the dark tunnel&nbsp;<ref name=FOX>{{cite news |title=Eyeless Creature Discovered in Undersea Tunnel |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,542500,00.html |date=25 August 2009 |publisher= [[LiveScience]] |author=Jeanna Bryner |accessdate=29 August 2009}}</ref>.

==Discovery==
During a cave diving expedition to explore the [[Tunnel de la Atlantida]], currently the world<U+2019>s longest known submarine [[lava tube]] on Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, an international team of scientists and [[cave diving|cave divers]] discovered the previously unknown species of crustacean, belonging to the remipede genus ''[[Speleonectes]]'', along with two new species of [[annelid|annelid worms]] of the class [[Polychaeta]]&nbsp;<ref name=FOX/>. The species was named after the tunnel it was found in&nbsp;<ref name=NG/><ref name=SD/>. It is morphologically very similar to ''[[Speleonectes ondinae]]'', a remipede that has been known from the same lava tube since 1985, but [[DNA]] comparison studies proved that it is a second species&nbsp;<ref name="SD"/>. The divergence of the two species may have occurred after the formation of the {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} lava tube during an eruption of the [[Monte Corona]] volcano some 20,000 years ago&nbsp;<ref name="SD"/>.
