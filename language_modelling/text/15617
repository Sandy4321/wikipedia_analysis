[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] '''Sir Michael David "Mike" Jackson''',<ref name="DL"/> {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Aide de Camp|ADC]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]]}} (born 21&nbsp;March 1944)<ref name="tele profile"/> is a retired [[British Army]] officer and one of its most high-profile generals since the Second World War.<ref name="BBC profile"/> Originally commissioned into the [[Intelligence Corps]] in 1963, he transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], with whom he served two of his three tours of duty in [[Northern Ireland]]. On his first, he was present as an [[adjutant]] at the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] (1972), when soldiers opened fire on protesters, killing 13 people. On his second, he was a [[company commander]] in the aftermath of the [[Warrenpoint ambush]] (1979), the British Army's heaviest single loss of life during [[the Troubles]]. He was assigned to a staff post at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) in 1982 before assuming command of the [[1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]], in 1984. Jackson was posted to Northern Ireland for the third time, as a brigade commander, in the early 1990s.

In 1994, Jackson served his first tour in the [[Balkans]], where he commanded a multi-national division of the [[IFOR|Implementation Force]]. Following a staff job back in the UK, he was appointed commander of [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] (ARRC) in 1997. He returned to the Balkans with the ARRC during the [[Kosovo War]], during which he famously refused to obey an order from American General [[Wesley Clark]], his immediate superior in the NATO chain of command, to block the runways of [[Pristina International Airport Adem Jashari|Pristina Airport]] and isolate the Russian contingent that was positioned there. He reportedly told Clark "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". The incident attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, and earned Jackson the nickname "Macho Jacko" in the British tabloid press. Jackson established a working relationship with the Russian general commanding the detachment at Pristina, giving him a bottle of whisky, of which Jackson is known to be fond, and providing the Russians with the protection of a squad of British soldiers, commanded by his son, Mark.

Upon his return to the UK, Jackson was promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] and appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces|Commander-in-Chief, Land Command]], the second-most senior position in the British Army. After three years as Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was appointed [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, in 2003. He took up the post a month before the start of the [[Iraq War]], amid disputes over the legality of the invasion and claims that the Army was under-equipped. However, he dismissed suggestions that the Army was at "breaking point". The most controversial point of his tenure as CGS was the restructuring of the [[regiment]] system and amalgamation of many regiments into larger ones, leading to the loss of historic regiment names. He was succeeded as Chief of the General Staff by [[Richard Dannatt|Sir Richard Dannatt]] in 2006, and retired from the Army after serving for almost 45&nbsp;years.

Jackson continues to speak on military matters and works as a consultant and guest lecturer, and has published an autobiography. He has three children, from two marriages, and four grandchildren.

==Early life==
Jackson's father, George, served as a soldier in the [[Household Cavalry]] before being commissioned into the [[Royal Army Service Corps]]. On  [[D-Day]], George Jackson assumed command of a squadron of amphibious landing vehicles after his commanding officer was killed in action, and he was later awarded the Belgian [[Croix de guerre|Croix de Guerre]] and [[mentioned in despatches]] for his actions. Mike was born at his mother's home in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], in 1944. After the Second World War, George Jackson was eventually posted to [[Tripoli]], Libya, where the family lived for two years, during which time Jackson's younger sister was born. After suffering a [[heart attack]], George Jackson retired with the rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]] after 40&nbsp;years in the Army.<ref name="Soldier 1-3">''Soldier'', pp.1<U+2013>3.</ref><ref name="tele int"/> Jackson's mother, Ivy, was from Yorkshire and won a scholarship to [[Sheffield Grammar School]] before becoming a curator at a museum in Sheffield.<ref name="5-7"/>

Jackson was educated at various primary schools as the family moved with his father's postings before being sent to [[Stamford School]], an independent boarding school in south [[Lincolnshire]], where he became a house [[prefect#Academic|prefect]]. He joined the school's [[Combined Cadet Force]] along with [[John Drewienkiewicz]], who eventually became a major general. By the age of 15 Jackson had decided that he wanted to be a soldier.<ref name="tele int"/><ref name="5-7">''Soldier'', pp 5<U+2013>7.</ref>

==Early military career==
Despite being advised by the headmaster at Stamford to consider university, Jackson applied to join the [[British Army]] in 1961. He was accepted, and started at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in January 1962, graduating on 20 December 1963.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=43241|supp=yes|startpage=1262|endpage=1264|date=7 February 1964|accessdate=15 March 2011}}</ref> While at Sandhurst, he became increasingly interested in the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]], but eventually applied to, and was commissioned into, the [[Intelligence Corps]] as a [[second lieutenant]] at the age of 19. After his commissioning, Jackson took up an opportunity offered by the Intelligence Corps to undertake platoon commanders' training with a combat regiment, and opted to do so with the Parachute Regiment.<ref>''Soldier'', p.21.</ref> Before leaving Sandhurst, he had applied to take an "in-service degree"<U+2014>a degree sponsored by the Army at a civilian university<U+2014>and was accepted to read [[Russian studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], returning to the Army after graduation in 1967.<ref name="tele profile"/><ref>''Soldier'', p.24.</ref><ref name="UKGN">{{cite news|url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/army_senior_appointments/22296.html|title=Army senior appointments|date=23 July 2002|work=United Kingdom Government News|accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> His first promotion was to [[lieutenant]] on 20 June 1965,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=43689|supp=yes|startpage=5975|date=22 June 1965|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> and he served with the Parachute Regiment in Malaysia, Hong Kong and [[Anguilla]]<U+2014>where he served as adjutant when his battalion relieved the force sent to restore order during the [[History_of_Anguilla#Recent_history|1969 emergency]]<U+2014>after which he was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].<ref>''Soldier'', pp.37<U+2013>39.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=44994|supp=yes|startpage=12862|date=22 December 1969|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> Following Anguilla, his tenure with the Parachute Regiment ended and he reluctantly returned to the Intelligence Corps. He became increasingly determined to rejoin the Parachute Regiment and, after almost a year, was eventually allowed to transfer, retaining the rank of captain in 1970.<ref>''Soldier'' p.45.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=45240|supp=yes|startpage=13112|date=1 December 1970|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> 

He went on to serve in [[Northern Ireland]] as [[adjutant]] to [[1st Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]] (1 PARA), and was present at the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], 30&nbsp;January 1972, when 13&nbsp;protesters were shot dead by soldiers from 1 PARA in [[Derry]].<ref name="tele profile"/> He was in the tactical headquarters of the Army's operation to contain the protests immediately before the shooting began and he accompanied the battalion commander, [[Derek Wilford]], when Wilford decided to join the soldiers on the ground. The shooting was over by the time Jackson reached the soldiers' position, but he recalls seeing several bodies in the back of an Army vehicle.<ref>''Soldier'', pp.65<U+2013>67.</ref> In 1976, he was promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46953|supp=yes|startpage=9285|endpage=9286|date=6 July 1976|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> and attended the [[Staff College, Camberley]], before being posted to Germany as chief of staff to the [[Berlin Infantry Brigade]].<ref name="tele profile"/> After Berlin, Jackson served his second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time as a [[company commander]]. While there, he witnessed the aftermath of the 1979 [[Warrenpoint ambush]], the British Army's single largest loss of life during [[The Troubles]]. He acted as the incident commander, arriving on the scene shortly after the second explosion, and had to identify Major Peter Fursman, a close friend, from the remains of Fursman's face, which had been blown clear of his skull.<ref name="tele profile"/><ref>''Soldier'', p.123.</ref> He later spoke of the effect the incident had on him, saying, "It greatly disturbed me. Still does".<ref name="tele int"/> He was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 1979 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]]<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=47869|supp=yes|startpage=5|date=16 June 1979|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> and was mentioned in despatches in 1981, in recognition of his service in Northern Ireland.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48651|supp=yes|startpage=8086|date=16 June 1981|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>

Having attended the [[Joint Service Defence College|National Defence College]],<ref name="cranfield"/> Jackson joined the directing staff at the Army Staff College and was promoted to [[lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in 1981.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48677|supp=yes|startpage=9300|date=13 July 1981|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> He served as a member of the directing staff at the Staff College, Camberley, for two and a half years. During his tenure at Camberley, he was seconded to a staff position at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1982 during the [[Falklands War]], and thus missed the opportunity to serve in the conflict directly. He took command of 1 PARA in March 1984, who, at the time, were deployed in Norway, training for the possibility of a Soviet attack. Concerned that he was insufficiently prepared for the weather conditions, he left Camberley early to train with the [[Royal Marines]].<ref>''Soldier'', pp.142<U+2013>143.</ref> He was appointed Senior Directing Staff (Army) at the [[Joint Service Defence College]] from 1986 to 1988<ref name="tele profile"/> and was promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] in 1987.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=50979|supp=yes|startpage=8354|endpage=8355|date=30 June 1987|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref> 

While serving as a colonel, Jackson considered resigning his commission. He wondered if he had missed his chance for promotion to [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] at the age of 44, and believed he might have "reached [his] ceiling" as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion.<ref name="tele int"/><ref>''Soldier'', p.151.</ref> He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31&nbsp;December 1989,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52017|supp=yes|startpage=640|date=15 January 1990|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper on the future of the Army and taking the [[Higher Command and Staff Course]].<ref name="cranfield"/> He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding [[39th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|39 Infantry Brigade]]<U+2014>a post he held until 1992, thus missing the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="tele int"/><ref name="cranfield">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaworld.org/Public/Page_Local.aspx?Id=297|title=General Sir Mike Jackson GCB CBE DSO|publisher=Cranfield Management Association|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> He was promoted from Member to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1992.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=53086|supp=yes|startpage=17975|date=26 October 1992|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>

==High command==
Jackson attained [[general officer]] status with promotion to acting [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major general]] in May 1992, after holding only one post as a brigadier; in peacetime, senior officers are normally expected to have held two posts before promotion. He was appointed Director General Personal Services (Army) at the Ministry of Defence, reporting to the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant General]].<ref name="tele profile"/><ref>''Soldier'', p.174.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52925|supp=yes|startpage=8574|date=18 May 1992|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> He was granted the substantive rank of major general in June 1992, with his promotion backdated to October 1991.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=52983|supp=yes|startpage=11403|date=6 July 1992|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> After two years at the MoD, Jackson took command of the [[3rd Mechanised Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Mechanised Division]] in April 1994.<ref name="tele profile"/><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=53690|supp=yes|startpage=8294|date=6 June 1994|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> During the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in 1995, Jackson had been due to succeed [[Rupert Smith]] as commander of the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR), which would have entailed early promotion to [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|lieutenant general]] ([[3 star rank|three-star rank]]) and a blue beret, signifying [[UN]] command. As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement]], however, UNPROFOR became the [[NATO]]-led [[IFOR|Implementation Force]] (IFOR), and Jackson remained a major general ([[2 star rank|two-star rank]]), commanding the 3rd Division and troops from several other countries who made up [[IFOR#Components|Multinational Division South-West]].<ref name="UKGN"/> Jackson retained command of the 3rd Division until July 1996 and went on to serve briefly in a staff post as the Army's Director General of Development and Doctrine.<ref name="cranfield"/><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54486|supp=yes|startpage=10563|date=5 August 1996|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> He was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in November 1996.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54574|supp=yes|startpage=14850|date=8 November 1996|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>

After he was appointed Commander of NATO's [[Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] (ARRC), Jackson was promoted to acting lieutenant general in January 1997,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54648|supp=yes|startpage=476|date=14 January 1997|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> a rank he was granted substantively in April 1997.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=54726|supp=yes|startpage=4170|date=8 April 1997|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> Jackson served in the NATO chain of command, reporting to the [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]], American [[4 star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[Wesley Clark]]. Under Jackson's command, the ARRC deployed to [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in March 1999,<ref name="UKGN"/> where Jackson served his second tour of duty in the Balkans, commanding [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], NATO's multi-national peacekeeping force established at the end of the [[Kosovo War]]. He gained significant media attention in June 1999 after a [[Incident at Pristina|confrontation with Clark]] in which he refused to block the runways of the Russian-occupied [[Pristina]] Airport and isolate the Russian troops there, thus preventing them from flying in reinforcements, after the order was queried by Captain [[James Blunt|James Blount]].<ref name="tele int"/><ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport |date=9 March 2000|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/singer-james-blunt-prevented-world-war-3-refused-us-order-to-attack-russian-troops-15004204.html|title=Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War 3'|last=Peck|first=Tom|date=15 November 2010|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> In one heated discussion with Clark, Jackson reputedly told him "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you".<ref name="BBC"/> He later told the [[BBC]] he believed that obeying the order would have led to the possibility of an armed confrontation with Russian troops, which he felt was not "the right way to start off a relationship with Russians".<ref name="BBC"/> The point became moot when the US government prevailed upon neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania, to prevent Russian use of their airspace to fly in reinforcements.<ref name="BBC"/> Jackson was criticised for his actions by American military officers and politicians, including General [[Hugh Shelton]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], who called the incident "troubling", and Senator [[John Warner]], who accused Jackson of insubordination.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/10/world/us-general-was-overruled-in-kosovo.html?src=pm|title=U.S. General Was Overruled in Kosovo|last=Becker|first=Elizabeth|date=10 September 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>

As a result of the incident at Pristina Airport, Jackson was dubbed "Macho Jacko" by the British press.<ref name="tele int"/><ref name="thin ice"/> Among his troops, Jackson was christened "[[Darth Vader]]" and "Prince of Darkness", owing to his temper and gravelly voice.<ref name="tele profile"/><ref name="vader">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo/369068.stm|title='Darth Vader' put on the spot |date=15 June 1999|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 March 2010}}</ref> Following the confrontation with Clark, Jackson went out to the airport to meet Viktor Zavarzin, the Russian general leading the detachment, and established a working relationship with him.

Upon his return to the British chain of command in early 2000, he assumed the position of [[Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces|Commander-in-Chief, Land Command]], the second-highest position in the British Army, and a post which entailed promotion to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] and membership of the [[Army Board]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=55782|supp=yes|startpage=2558|date=7 March 2000|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> As Commander-in-Chief, Jackson was responsible for assembling forces for the 2000 British [[Sierra_Leone_Civil_War#Operation_Palliser|intervention in Sierra Leone]], which included Brigadier [[David Richards (British Army officer)|David Richards]]<U+2014>later [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]]<U+2014>and Jackson's son Mark. He also handled requests from the civilian authorities for assistance with the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|foot-and-mouth disease crisis]], floods and strikes [[UK firefighter dispute 2002<U+2013>2003|by firefighters]] and fuel-tanker drivers.<ref>''Soldier'', pp. 307<U+2013>310.</ref> While still Commander-in-Chief, he stood in for the Chief of the General Staff, marching behind the coffin at the state funeral of [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]], in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-447405-tears-for-the-queen-mother.do|title=Tears for the Queen Mother|last=Low|first=Valentine|date=5 March 2002|work=[[Evening Standard]]|publisher=ES London Limited|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> At the time of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]], Jackson was on a visit to the British [[British Army Training Unit Suffield|training facility]] in Alberta, Canada.

He later said that he "did his homework" in researching the [[Legality of the Iraq War|disputed legality]] of the war and had convinced himself that the invasion was legal.<ref name="tele int"/> Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Jackson ordered an inquiry into the alleged abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. He admitted that the allegations had damaged the Army's reputation, but believed that further damage would be done by covering them up. Several soldiers were eventually convicted in connection with the abuse, after which Jackson publicly apologised on behalf the British Army and promised to appoint an officer to determine what lessons needed to be learnt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4296511.stm|title=Iraq abuse case soldiers jailed|date=25 February 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref> Weeks after becoming CGS, Jackson was summoned to give evidence before the [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry]].<ref name="tele profile"/>

The most controversial action of Jackson's tenure as CGS was the Army's modernisation of the [[regiment]]al structure in 2004, in which many regiments were merged to form larger ones. The amalgamations led to the loss of many regimental names, including the [[Devonshire and Dorset Regiment]], which became part of [[The Rifles]], and the [[Black Watch]], which, after intervention by [[Queen Elizabeth II]], retained its name but became a battalion of the [[Royal Regiment of Scotland]].<ref name="tele int"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/dec/07/military.monarchy|title=Queen steps into Black Watch row|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|date=7 December 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref> Jackson insisted that the change was necessary to give the Army greater flexibility and capability, but said he was "acutely aware that this will be sad and unwelcome news for at least some of the infantry".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article460078.ece|title=20,000 posts slashed in defence cuts|date=22 July 2004|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref> As part of the same review, the [[arms plot]] system, which kept infantry units moving around every few years, was also phased out as being inefficient.<ref name="thin ice">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/general-sir-mike-jackson-i-was-skating-on-some-thin-ice-but-i-made-damn-certain-i-was-not-going-to-fall-through-751810.html|title=General Sir Mike Jackson: 'I was skating on some thin ice, but I made damn certain I was not going to fall through'|last=Brown|first=Colin|date=22 November 2004|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>

During the [[Iraq War]] Jackson admitted that the war was putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was "at breaking point", "nonsense".<ref name="thin ice"/> Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: "There's a bit of a fuss going on about boots and bog rolls and whatnot.

==Retirement==
Jackson retired in 2006. He spent nearly 45&nbsp;years in the Army but called it "a regret" that he never fought in a conventional battle<U+2014>having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that "Fighting is what a young man with good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier".<ref name="tele int"/> He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement.<ref name="BBC profile"/> He delivered the annual [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture]] four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled ''The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century'', he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation "frankly shaming" and saying that the "Armed Forces' contract with the nation&nbsp;... must be a two-way one", going on to say that "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms".<ref name="Dimbleby">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article663229.ece|title=Sir Mike Jackson: Dimbleby lecture full text|date=7 December 2006|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Ltd]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The MoD responded by saying that "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise<U+2014>for example in relation to medical services and accommodation<U+2014>that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6215296.stm|title=Former Army chief criticises MoD|date=7 December 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>

At the end of 2006 Jackson took up a consultancy job with [[PA Consulting Group]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/dec/11/3|title=Sir Mike joins ranks of consultants|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard|date=11 December 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> and he has given lectures on leadership. His autobiography, ''Soldier'', was published in 2007 by [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]]. [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]], writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', called the book "an engaging and honest account that would repay reading by all those who seek to understand the 21st-century British Army",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/soldier-by-general-sir-mike-jackson-464506.html|title=Soldier, By General Sir Mike Jackson|last=[[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Sheffield, Gary]]|date=21 September 2007|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> but Peter Beaumont, foreign affairs editor for ''[[The Observer]]'', called it "disappointing" and commented that "in the end it is Jackson's opinions&nbsp;... rather than any powerful new detail that emerges". He suspected that the book had been heavily edited by the army's lawyers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/sep/09/biography.features1|title=Stiff upper lip <U+2013> buttoned|last=Beaumont|first=Peter|date=9 September 2007|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> Determined to keep active in retirement, Jackson recalled advice he had been given by a friend<U+2014>"whatever you do, don't settle for pruning the roses or soon enough you'll be pushing them up".<ref name="tele int">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1561897/General-Sir-Mike-Jackson-speaks-out.html|title=General Sir Mike Jackson speaks out|last=Grice|first=Elizabeth|date=1 September 2007|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref>

Jackson re-appeared in the headlines when he and other retired generals, including Major General [[Tim Cross]]<U+2014>who was involved in the planning effort and later commanded all British troops in Iraq<U+2014>criticised the American post-war planning for Iraq and attacked the statement by [[Donald Rumsfeld]], [[US Secretary of Defense]], at the time of the invasion, that the US does not "do nation-building", calling it "nonsensical" and "intellectually bankrupt".<ref name="nonsensical">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6973618.stm|title=UK general attacks US Iraq policy|date=1 September 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6974611.stm|title=Fresh UK attack on US Iraq policy|date=2 September 2007|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> Jackson also joined criticism of the [[British National Party]] (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 [[Question Time British National Party controversy|controversy]] surrounding party leader [[Nick Griffin]]'s appearance on the panel show ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. He accused the BNP of "hijacking" military symbols, saying "the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?" He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannat "war criminals".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/bnp-leader-griffin-says-britains-military-generals-are-lsquolike-nazisrsquo-14537229.html|title=BNP leader Griffin says Britain's military generals are <U+2018>like Nazis<U+2019>|date=21 October 2009|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Independent News & Media]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8317353.stm|title=BNP hits back at generals' attack|date=20 October 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/20/former-army-heads-attack-bnp|title=Generals slam BNP for 'hijacking' reputation of armed forces|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=20 October 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> A disagreement between Jackson and then [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Bob Ainsworth]] made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|Afghanistan]], saying that the Army had pushed "too hard" when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

After the [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry|Saville Report]] published its findings in June 2010, Jackson gave an interview in which he joined Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] in offering a "fulsome apology" for the events. He acknowledged that troops of the First Parachute Battalion, of which he was adjutant, had killed people "without justification", but went on to observe that "Northern Ireland is a very different place [in 2010], not least because of sacrifices made" by the soldiers who had served there, and asked that the report "be seen in this context".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8742373.stm|title=General Sir Mike Jackson apologises for Bloody Sunday|date=15 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=16 March 2011}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Jackson married while at university in 1966. The marriage, of which Jackson does not speak publicly, produced two children (Amanda and Mark) before ending in a divorce in the early 1980s. He married again in 1985, to Sarah (n<U+00E9>e Coombe), whom he met when they debated the Falklands War at a dinner party in 1984. The couple had a son, Tom, in 1990. Jackson's daughter Amanda is a mother of four and runs a [[public house]]. Mark joined the Army and served under his father's command in Kosovo. He also served in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, eventually reaching the rank of major, but left the Army in 2002 after being seriously injured in a civilian parachuting accident two years earlier.<ref>''Soldier'', p.311.</ref> He now works as an artist and sculptor.<ref name="BBC profile"/><ref name="tele int"/>

Jackson was well known for having large bags under his eyes, which he had surgically removed shortly after his retirement. He stated that it was a matter of "vision, not vanity", as the bags had been impairing his sight.<ref name="tele int"/> Jackson lists his interests as music, reading, travel, skiing, and tennis.<ref name="tele profile"/>
