The main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] was between [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and [[Triple H]], with the two feuding over the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. At [[SummerSlam (2003)|SummerSlam]], Triple H and Goldberg were involved in the second six men [[Elimination Chamber]] match for the World Championship (the first one being the previous year at [[Survivor Series (2002)|Survivor Series]]). After Goldberg eliminated three other men in that match, he went after Triple H. At the end, Goldberg attempted another [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|Spear]] on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with a [[sledgehammer]] for the win. On the following night's edition of ''Raw'', Goldberg challenged Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H then came out and added the stipulation that, should Goldberg lose, he would retire from WWE. At the previous Raw brand pay-per-view [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]], Goldberg defeated Triple H with the title and his career on the line, when he performed a [[Powerslam#Suplex powerslam|Jackhammer]] to win the title.<ref name="Unforgiven 2003 Main Event">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/unforgiven/history/2003/mainevent|title=Triple H vs. Goldberg for the World Heavyweight Championship|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=WWE}}</ref> On the September 29 edition of ''Raw'', Triple H made an announcement, offering a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] of [[United States dollar|$]]100,000 to anyone who could successfully "take out" Goldberg. The first person that attempted to take the bounty was [[Stevie Richards|Steven Richards]], but Goldberg quickly took him out.<ref name="RAW - September 29, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/030929.html|title=RAW Results <U+2013> September 29, 2003|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> Many other people tried and failed to take him out including [[La R<U+00E9>sistance (professional wrestling)|La R<U+00E9>sistance]], [[Mark Henry]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]].<ref name="RAW - October 6, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/031006.html|title=RAW Results <U+2013> October 6, 2003|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="RAW - October 13, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/031013.html|title=RAW Results <U+2013> October 13, 2003|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> It was during a World Heavyweight Championship match between Goldberg and [[Shawn Michaels]] on the October 20 edition of ''Raw'', however, that he was taken out.<ref name="RAW - October 20, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/031020.html|title=RAW Results <U+2013> October 20, 2003|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> [[Dave Batista|Batista]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Run-in|ran-in]], dragged Michaels out of the ring and, in [[kayfabe|storyline]], assaulted him.

The main feud on the [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] brand was between WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] and [[The Undertaker]]. At the previous SmackDown! brand pay-per-view, [[No Mercy (2003)|No Mercy]], McMahon interfered in a [[WWE Championship]] [[Professional wrestling match types#(Object) on a Pole match|Biker Chain match]] between the Champion [[Brock Lesnar]] and Undertaker, helping Lesnar retain the title.<ref name="No Mercy 2003 Main Event">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/history/2003/mainevent|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker in a Biker Chain Match for the WWE Championship|accessdate=2008-01-21|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Also at the same pay-per-view, Vince defeated his daughter [[Stephanie McMahon]] in an [["I Quit" match]]. Due to a pre-match stipulation between the two, Stephanie had to quit her job as [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General managers 2|SmackDown! General Manager]].<ref name="SLAM!

In his first act as General Manager, Heyman [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|handicap match]], with Undertaker facing Brock Lesnar and [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], with the stipulation that if he won, Undertaker could choose to face any superstar at any event. Heyman put many stipulations in Undertaker's way during the bout, but despite this, Undertaker won the contest. Undertaker stared at Vince, who was lying on the ground in the arena rampway. As a result of the win, Undertaker stated that he wanted a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] at Survivor Series. Vince stated that he hopes Lesnar buries Undertaker "six feet under". Undertaker then stated that the match wouldn't be against Lesnar, however, but against Vince McMahon.<ref name="SmackDown - October 23, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/031023.html|title=SmackDown!

Primary feud from Raw brand heading into the event was between the two [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers|Co-General Managers on Raw]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Eric Bischoff]]. Bischoff had control of the brand since July 15, 2002, but on April 28, 2003 (the night after the [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]] pay per view), he was forced to share his General Manager duties with Austin.<ref name="RAW - July 15, 2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020715.html|title=RAW Results <U+2013> July 15, 2002|accessdate=2008-01-22|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="RAW - April 28, 2003">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Tylwalk|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/04/29/75624.html|title=Raw: Stone Cold GM|accessdate=2008-02-07|date=2003-04-29|publisher=SLAM!

Austin promptly accepted the challenge, with Bischoff announcing the first two members of his team as [[Scott Steiner]] and [[Chris Jericho]]. Later in the night, [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] was announced as the first member of Austin's Survivor Series team.<ref name="RAW - October 20, 2003"/> The following week, [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]] and [[Devon Hughes|D-Von Dudley]] were named as members of Austin's team.<ref name="October 27"/><ref name="October 27, 2003"/> For Team Bischoff, [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] and [[Mark Henry]] were announced as members as well.<ref name="October 27">{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/031027.html|title=Raw results <U+2013> October 27, 2003|accessdate=2008-07-19|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref name="October 27, 2003">{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/031027.htm|title=Bischoff's whole Dam show ruined|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2003-10-27|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> On the November 3 edition of ''Raw'', both Austin and Bischoff announced their final members to join their respective team; [[Shawn Michaels]] accepted Austin's invitation to join his team and Bischoff announced as [[Randy Orton]] the last member to join his team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/031103.html|title=Raw results <U+2013> November 3, 2003|accessdate=2008-07-19|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwwew.net/tv/raw/031103.htm|title=Team Austin gets a Leg Up on Team Bischoff|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2003-11-03|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> The on and off feud between five members from Team Austin and Team Bischoff originally began during the Summer of 2001, when Rob Van Dam, the Dudley boyz, and Booker T (who were a part of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]) started their feud with Christian and Chris Jericho (who were a part of the then-known WWF) when they all were involved in the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion storyline]] but the storyline ended at that year's [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] event when [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] (who fought for Team WWF) won the 5-on-5 Winner Takes All match, thus putting the Alliance out of business. During the Summer and Fall of 2002, Booker T (from Team Austin), along with [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]], had fought Jericho and Christian (from Team Bischoff) in singles and tag team competition. They also fought for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] that Jericho and Christian held at the time until December 2002 at [[Armageddon (2002)|Armageddon]] when they dropped the titles to Booker T and Goldust in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|Fatal Four-Way Elimination match]]. After Armageddon, Chris Jericho along with Christian entered a feud with Shawn Michaels (from Team Austin), after Jericho claimed that he was the next Shawn Michaels. On the January 13, 2003 edition of ''Raw'', Jericho won a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] to select his entry number for the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels, who had already been named number one. At the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]], Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels. Moments later during the Rumble match, Michaels retaliated by assaulting Jericho, which allowed [[Andrew Martin|Test]] to eliminate Jericho. The following two months, the feud between Jericho and Michaels continued to escalate leading up to their match at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. During that event, Michaels defeated Jericho when he countered Jericho's [[suplex]] into a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|Roll-up]] that gave Michaels a successful pinfall, thus the victory. On the July 21st edition of ''Raw'', Jericho defeated Michaels in a rematch with the help of then [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] member Randy Orton (from Team Bischoff). At [[Unforgiven (2003)|Unforgiven]] on September 21, Orton defeated Shawn Michaels in the first of many high profile matches billed as "Legend versus Legend Killer", with the help of his stablemate and mentor [[Ric Flair]]. The feud between Christian and Rob Van Dam (from Team Austin) originally started after Christian became the three-time [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWE Intercontinental Champion]] by defeating Booker T at an untelevised [[house show]]. At Unforgiven, Christian successfully defended the Intercontinental title against both Rob Van Dam and Chris Jericho in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] when he pinned RVD. Then in the following two matches in one week, Christian defended the title against RVD including on the September 29, 2003 edition of ''Raw'', when he lost the title to RVD in a [[Ladder match]]. On that same episode of ''Raw'', Scott Steiner (from Team Bischoff) turned heel by [[Suplex#Belly to belly suplex|belly to belly suplexing]] [[Stacy Keibler]] after Keibler accidentally cost Steiner and Test the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] against the Dudley boyz (from Team Austin). While Steiner and Test teamed together, with Keibler their reluctant manager, Steiner would feud with RVD and the Dudley boyz respectively in the weeks leading up to Survivor Series. During the Summer of 2003, Mark Henry (from Team Bischoff) returned to WWE television on the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] roster, where he found some success as a member of "Thuggin' And Buggin' Enterprises," led by [[Theodore Long]]. During that time, Henry was involved in a brief program with [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] when then champion, [[Triple H]], put a bounty on Goldberg. This was followed by a brief rivalry that he had with Shawn Michaels, before he engaged in a scripted rivalry with Booker T (who returned to Raw from a nagging back injury). On the November 10th edition of ''Raw'', Team Austin and Team Bischoff were scheduled four matches with Team Austin gaining 3<U+2013>1 victories in one night. In a tag team match, Scott Steiner and Mark Henry defeated the Dudley boyz. But in three singles matches, Rob Van Dam defeated Christian, Booker T defeated Chris Jericho, and Shawn Michaels defeated Randy Orton to get the greater advantage heading into the pay-per-view.

[[Image:Brock Lesnar - WWE Champion.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Brock Lesnar]] as [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]]]]
The first match of the event was the [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Elimination tag team matches|Survivor Series match]] with Team Angle ([[Kurt Angle]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[John Cena]], [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]], and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]) against Team Lesnar ([[Brock Lesnar]], [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]], [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] and [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]]).

The next match was for the [[WWE Women's Championship]] between [[Nora Greenwald|Molly Holly]] and [[Amy Dumas|Lita]]. The match ended up on the outside on two separate occasions. Lita missed a [[Moonsault|Litasault]] and Molly took advantage and hit the Molly-Go-Round. However Lita kicked out, forcing Molly to expose a turnbuckle into which she gave Lita a [[Professional wrestling throws#Drop toe-hold|drop toe hold]], thus retaining the Women's title.<ref name="series2003"/>

The third match was an [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Ambulance match]] between [[Shane McMahon]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. The match started on the outside when Shane was thrown into the steel steps by Kane. Mid-way in the match, Shane was able to hit the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]] on Kane on the Spanish announce table. Following the maneuver, Shane took control in the match, as he hit Kane with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]],  rammed Kane through a security booth with an SUV. Shane then called for an ambulance. Shane maneuvered Kane onto a stretcher and started pushing it towards the ambulance, however Kane sat up and bounced Shane off. Shane was able to do a [[Dropkick#Corner-to-corner missile dropkick|Coast-To-Coast]] off the roof of the ambulance on Kane. The match came to an end, when Kane hit Shane with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] on  the floor and then threw him into the ambulance, which resulted in Kane gaining the win.<ref name="series2003"/>

The fourth match was between The [[Basham Brothers]] ([[Doug Basham|Doug]] and [[Daniel Hollie|Danny]]) and [[Los Guerreros]] ([[Eddie Guerrero|Eddie]] and [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo]]) for the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]]. The match started on the outside. Los Guerreros attacked [[Linda Miles|Shaniqua]], who tried to interfere. Chavo hit a swinging DDT, but he accidentally hit the DDT on Eddie.

Jericho was the next member eliminated of Team Bischoff, as he tried to apply the [[Boston crab|Walls of Jericho]] on Michaels, however Michaels countered it into a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Cradle|Cradle]]. As the elimination took place, it left Michaels and Orton as the final two members of their respective teams. However, the match came to an end, when [[Dave Batista|Batista]] gave Michaels a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Batista Bomb]], after Austin and Bischoff brawled in the entrance set, Orton draped an arm over Michaels and got the pinfall. As a result of his team losing, Austin lost his position as Co-General Manager of [[WWE Raw|Raw]].<ref name="series2003"/>

The match that followed was the [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Buried Alive match]] between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Vince McMahon]]. At the start of the match, Undertaker hit McMahon with one big punch to the face, which resulted in McMahon bleeding. Vince's face was covered in lots of blood. Undertaker hit McMahon in the head with one of the shovels. After many assaults by Undertaker, he carried McMahon to the grave site. McMahon was able to hit the Undertaker with a shovel, which resulted in Undertaker falling to the grave site, but pulled McMahon into it as well. Undertaker climbed up to a front loader to empty a ton of dirt on the grave, but an explosion knocked him out. [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] appeared out of nowhere, beat on Undertaker and threw him into the grave. McMahon operated the front loader and dumped all the dirt burying the Undertaker. McMahon won the match.<ref name="series2003"/>

The final match of the night was between [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and [[Triple H]] for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]]. In the match, Triple H focused on Goldberg's ankle. In the duration of the match, [[Ric Flair]], [[Randy Orton]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] all interfered on behalf of Triple H; however, Goldberg hit Flair, Orton and Batista with a [[sledgehammer]], which was brought in by Triple H. The match came to an end when Goldberg nailed Triple H with a Spear, and then followed up with the Jackhammer for the pinfall and thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name="series2003"/>
