'''Walden Galleria''' is an enclosed [[shopping mall]] located in the [[Buffalo, New York]] suburb of [[Cheektowaga, New York|Cheektowaga]]. The largest mall in the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area,<ref name="cheek"/> it is also the busiest in the region, with more than 18 million shoppers annually.<ref name="bigger"/> Walden Galleria comprises more than {{convert|1600000|sqft|sqm|1|lk=on}} of retail space, with 250 stores on two levels, including a [[food court]] and a [[movie theater]]; [[anchor store]]s include [[Best Buy]], [[Dick's Sporting Goods]], [[DSW Shoe Warehouse]], [[JCPenney]], [[Lord & Taylor]], [[Macy's]], [[Old Navy]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], and the first [[Steve & Barry's University Sportswear]] in the state of New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pyramidmg.com/portfolio/walden_galleria.asp |title=Walden Galleria |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Pyramid Management}}</ref> The mall is owned and managed by [[The Pyramid Companies]] of [[Syracuse, New York]], the same management firm that developed it.

Opened in 1989, Walden Galleria initially featured national chains JCPenney and Sears, along with regional chain [[Bonwit Teller]], and local chains [[Sibley's]], L.L. Berger, and The Sample as its major tenants. As these local chains fell to bankruptcy in the 1990s, several [[big box]] tenants would be added to the mall to fill the vacancies; anchors [[Lord & Taylor]] and Galyan's (now Dick's Sporting Goods) were later additions to the existing mall property, opening in 1992 and 2000, respectively. The most recent renovation to Walden Galleria comprised an extensive $60 million renovation between 2006 and 2008, which added several new tenants; a new movie theater was opened May 2008, and a [[Barnes & Noble]] bookstore will be added.<ref name="bigger">{{cite web |url=http://buffalo.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2006/06/19/story1.html |title=Walden Galleria getting bigger |accessdate=2007-09-23 |last=Fink |first=James |date=2007-06-16 |work=Business First of Buffalo}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:JCPenney at Walden Galleria.JPG|200px|right|thumb|JCPenney, one of the original anchor stores to Walden Galleria]]
Walden Galleria was developed by [[The Pyramid Companies]], a New York-based shopping property management firm. Built on a site near Exit 52 of the [[New York State Thruway]], the mall was opened in 1989; at the time, the mall featured five anchor stores: [[Bonwit Teller]], JCPenney, and Sears, as well as Buffalo-based chains [[Sibley's]], L. L. Berger, and The Sample.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |Last=Robinson |title=Galleria set for opening on Monday: Area awaits impact of new megamall |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB19505A3931402&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |work=The Buffalo News |date=1989-4-30 |accessdate=2007-10-01 }}</ref> An additional anchor space was originally built for [[B.

In 1990, Sibley's was acquired and renamed by [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[Kaufmann's]]. That same year, local chain [[AM&A's]] (Adam, Meldrum & Anderson Company) moved from the nearby Thruway Mall into the space originally planned for B. Altman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4298/is_199009/ai_n14968063 |title=AM&A sets new Buffalo, N.Y. unit.

===Mid-late 1990s===
In 1995, [[York, Pennsylvania]]-based department store chain [[The Bon-Ton]] acquired the AM&A's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo was killed by a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority|NFTA Metro]] bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's [[African-American]] community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority east side to have easy access to the mall. In settling a wrongful death lawsuit against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro, and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E1DD1731F93AA25751C1A960958260 |title=The Cynthia Wiggins case |accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_1_97/ai_58170457|title=Buffalo, NY, Family Settles For $2.55 Mil.

Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996, as part of the chain's restructuring, with [[Old Navy]] soon opening in the store's former upper level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF99630ADF7268&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Bonwit Teller downsizing Walden Galleria store |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1996-07-20 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well; [[Bed Bath & Beyond]] later opened its first Buffalo-area store in the former lower level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9A20E80AE586&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Bed Bath & Beyond opens first area store in Galleria |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1997-05-01 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9991A4AD5487&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Bonwit Teller store closing |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1996-10-18 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer [[Finish Line]] opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF994F40E8D270&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Galleria adding big Finish Line apparel store |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1996-06-11 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref>

[[Montgomery Ward]], which acquired the Lechmere chain in 1994, closed the last of the Lechmere stores nationwide in 1998, as part of a corporate restructuring;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9A4EFB546BD2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Parent company plans to close Lechmere stores |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1997-08-01 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> half of the former Lechmere was then converted to a home store for JCPenney,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9B2FEB622372&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Six new stores have leased space in Walden Galleria |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1998-10-13 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> while the other half sat vacant until [[DSW Shoe Warehouse]] replaced it in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-6676388.html |title=Off-Price Shoe Retailer Plans Cheektowaga, N.Y., Store. |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=1999-10-12 |work=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News}}</ref> Linens 'n Wares, which closed at some point in the late 1990s, was converted to a home store for Kaufmann's in 1999 as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF9C4C8C2973C0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Furniture added at Kaufmann's location |accessdate=2007-09-23 |date=1999-11-03 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> One year later, a [[Galyan's]] Trading Company store was added onto the mall as well; this store was converted to the [[Dick's Sporting Goods]] name in 2004 with the acquisition of Galyan's.

===2000s===
Starting in 2000, the first of several renovation plans was announced for the mall. The initial plan called for the addition of a new, three-story wing with an eighteen-screen movie theater complex, as well as several upscale tenants. Under this proposal, the existing Sears store would have been converted to mall space, and a new Sears store built immediately behind it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-6451055.html |title=Buffalo, N.Y., Shopping Mall to Add Wing with Stores, Eateries, Parking Deck. |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=2000-12-04 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref>. These expansion plans, however, never came to fruition.

By 2002, General Cinemas had sold the mall's theater complex to [[AMC Theatres]].<ref name="cinema"/> One year later, Pyramid made an attempt to evict the theater for a [[Best Buy]] store; however, the eviction failed, and the theaters remained in operation,<ref name="cinema"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-122335580.html |title=Best Buy Decides against Opening Store in Buffalo, N.Y., Mall. |accessdate=2007-09-23 |last=Haarlander |first=Lisa |date=2003-05-08 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> although Best Buy would open a store at the mall next to Sears in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-142494251.html |title= Best Buy plans to build store at Walden Galleria near Sears |accessdate=2007-09-23 |last=Lindstedtn |first= Sharon |date=2006-02-23 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> AMC closed the mall's theaters in 2004, and only four days after their closing, the theater complex was acquired and reopened by [[Regal Cinemas]].<ref name="cinema"/>

The JCPenney Home Store, which was closed in 2002, was replaced one year later by the first [[Steve & Barry's]] store in the state of New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-8892402.html |title=Collegiate Apparel Store Opens in Buffalo, N.Y., Galleria. |accessdate=2007-09-23 |date=2003-07-23 |work=The Buffalo News}}</ref> Kaufmann's was one of several former [[May Co.]] brands to be acquired and re-named by Macy's in 2005; while the main Kaufmann's store was converted to Macy's, the Home Store was shuttered. Also in 2005, The Bon-Ton closed;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2005/11/14/daily26.html |title=Bon-Ton closing Walden Galleria store |accessdate=2007-10-01 |date=2005-11-16 |work=Business First of Buffalo}}</ref> finally, Bed Bath & Beyond moved outside the mall in 2007.<!--quit adding stuff about the Disney Store-->

===2006-present: Expansion===
[[Image:Walden Galleria construction.JPG|150px|right|thumb|Construction of the new concourse.]]
With the closure of The Bon-Ton in 2005, plans were once again announced to expand the Walden Galleria. Under these new plans, The Bon-Ton's former store was demolished for a new concourse composed of more than {{convert|250000|sqft|sqm|1|lk=on}} of new retail space. The mall's existing theater complex, which was located next to The Bon-Ton, was also demolished for a future [[Barnes & Noble]] bookstore, and a newer, larger theater complex; the latter opened at the end of May 2008.<ref name="cheek">{{cite web |url=http://www.cheektowagatimes.com/news/2006/0414/Front_Page/001.html |title= Expansion plans filed by Galleria |accessdate=2007-10-01 |work=Cheektowaga Times}}</ref><ref name="bigger"/> Several new restaurants, including [[The Cheescake Factory]] and The Melting Pot, were also added, as was [[Ruehl No.925]], a concept clothing store owned by [[Abercrombie & Fitch]].<ref name="bigger"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/stories/2008/05/12/daily12.html |title=Three new retailers come to Galleria |accessdate=2008-05-14 |last=Fink |first=James |date=2008-05-13 |work=Bizjournals.com}}</ref>
