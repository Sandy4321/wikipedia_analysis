'''''Thunderbirds Are Go''''' is a 1966 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[science-fiction]] film based on ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', a 1960s television series starring [[marionette]] puppets and featuring [[scale model]] effects in a filming process dubbed "[[Supermarionation]]". Written by ''Thunderbirds'' creators [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], directed by [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] and produced by [[AP Films]], ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' develops the franchise with a plot focusing on the futuristic spacecraft ''[[Zero-X]]'' and its [[manned mission to Mars]]. When ''Zero-X'' suffers a mechanical failure during [[Atmospheric reentry|re-entry]], it is up to International Rescue, with the aid of the [[Thunderbirds machines|''Thunderbird'' machines]], to save the astronauts onboard before the spacecraft is obliterated in a crash landing.

Filmed from March<ref name="Bentley: Gerry Anderson, 302"/> to June 1966<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 36"/> and premiering in December,<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 38"/> ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' includes, in a first for an AP Films production, [[cameo appearance]]s from puppets of real-life celebrities [[Cliff Richard]] and [[The Shadows]], who also contributed to the [[musical score]]. It is also the first motion picture to have been filmed with an early form of [[video assist]] technology known as "Add-a-Vision",<ref name="Bentley: Gerry Anderson, 302"/> and incorporated landscape footage that was shot on location in [[Portugal]].<ref name="Bentley: Gerry Anderson, 303"/> [[Special effects]] pieces, produced under the supervision of [[Derek Meddings]] and including rocket launch sequences, space shots and a miniature representation of the [[Geology of Mars|Martian surface]], required six months to complete.<ref name="Anderson, 56"/>

Despite positive initial reviews, which praised the film as a well-made cinematic transfer of the ''Thunderbirds'' television series,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/><ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 118"/> ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' soon proved to be a [[Box office bomb|box office failure]] for the Andersons.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 39"/> The disappointment of this outcome was intensified by the knowledge that Series Two of ''Thunderbirds'' would be cut down to six episodes<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 37"/> and that AP Films' upcoming television project would be a brand-new series, which would later be titled ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' and screened from 1967.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 37"/> To add to the lukewarm public response, negative critical reception of ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' has targeted, besides other aspects, the [[characterisation]] of the puppet cast,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/> the running time dedicated to model and effects shots,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/><ref name="TCM"/> and the fantasy [[dream sequence]] starring Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which has been described as a poor scriptwriting idea on the part of the Andersons.<ref name="Peel, 244"/>

Surprised by the underperformance of ''Thunderbirds Are Go'', the [[United Artists]] distributors authorised the production of a sequel.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 39"/> However, ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'' received a similarly unenthusiastic response on its release in 1968,<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 41"/> and the ''Thunderbirds'' franchise was abandoned until the appearance of a [[Thunderbirds (film)|reboot]], starring [[Live-action|live actors]], in 2004. Meanwhile, the ''Zero-X'' astronauts featured in their own [[Comic strip|strip]] in  the Anderson-related ''[[TV Century 21]]'' [[comic]] until 1969.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 139"/>

==Plot==
In 2065,<ref group="notes" name="Dates">Dates as confirmed in ''The Complete Book of Thunderbirds'' (Bentley, 96). The final Series Two episode of ''Thunderbirds'', "Give or Take a Million", appears to be set in December 2026 (Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 95) but this should be viewed as December 2067 (Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 95), placing the events of this Series Two episode after the finale of ''Thunderbirds Are Go''.</ref> the ''[[Zero-X]]'' spacecraft launches from Glenn Field as the first attempt at a [[manned mission to Mars]]. Unknown to Captain Paul Travers and his crew of two astronauts and two scientists, criminal mastermind [[The Hood (Thunderbirds)|The Hood]] has infiltrated the ship to photograph ''Zero-X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s wing mechanism. When his foot becomes trapped in the [[hydraulics]], The Hood causes a systems failure and ''Zero-X'' loses control. While the villain manages to extract his bloodied foot and parachute from the [[undercarriage]], Travers and his crew [[Ejection seat|eject]] in an [[escape pod]] and ''Zero-X'' crashes into the ocean before leaving [[Earth's atmosphere]].

In 2067,<ref group="notes" name="Dates"/> at the conclusion of an investigation into the loss of ''Zero-X'', the Inquiry Board of the Space Exploration Center reaches a verdict of sabotage. In the meantime, a second [[Mars]] mission has been planned. Days before the launch of the new ''Zero-X'', International Rescue agrees to a request to organise security in view of the possibility of another sabotage threat. [[Jeff Tracy]] dispatches [[Scott Tracy|Scott]] to Glenn Field in ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'', while [[Virgil Tracy|Virgil]] in ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'' and [[Alan Tracy|Alan]] in ''[[Thunderbird 3]]'' are assigned to escort ''Zero-X'' as it leaves the atmosphere. Posing as a reporter at the pre-launch press conference, [[Lady Penelope]] ensures that Travers and the other four crewmembers are delivered [[St. Christopher]] brooches. Ostensibly for luck, these are in fact [[homing device]]s. The next day, a search for Dr Grant's brooch checks negative. Scott unmasks the man waiting for lift-off onboard ''Zero-X'' as The Hood in another of his disguises. The saboteur flees Glenn Field in a car, which Penelope and [[Aloysius "Nosey" Parker|Parker]] pursue in [[FAB1]]. Transferring to a [[speedboat]], and then a [[helicopter]] piloted by an accomplice, The Hood is apparently killed when Parker shoots the aircraft down with the [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]]'s built-in [[machine gun]].<ref group="notes" name="Hood2">Surviving the explosion, [[The Hood (Thunderbirds)|The Hood]] returns in the sequel film, ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'', under the alias of "Black Phantom" (Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 98). However, in the DVD audio commentary for ''Thunderbird 6'', [[Sylvia Anderson]] states that this is a different character.</ref> Meanwhile, the real Grant is returned to ''Zero-X'' and the spacecraft launches without further incident.

Mission accomplished, Penelope invites Scott and Virgil to join her at "The Swinging Star", a fashionable nightclub. Landing back on [[Tracy Island]] after escorting ''Zero-X'', Alan feels unappreciated when Jeff insists that he remain on standby at base while his brothers spend the night partying. In bed, Alan experiences a [[Surrealism|surreal]] dream in which Parker "flies" him and Penelope in FAB1 to a version of The Swinging Star located in space. Present at the interstellar nightclub are "[[Cliff Richard]] Jr" and [[The Shadows]], who perform a song titled "Shooting Star" and an [[instrumental]], "Lady Penelope". The [[dream sequence]] ends abruptly when Alan plummets from The Swinging Star back to [[Earth]] and awakes to discover he has fallen out of bed.

After a six-week flight, the ''Zero-X'' Martian Exploration Vehicle [[Lander (spacecraft)|lands]] on Mars on July 22.<ref group="notes" name="Dates"/> While investigating the barren [[Geology of Mars|surface]], the crew are puzzled to encounter strange rock formations arranged into coils. Space Captain Greg Martin blasts one of the structures with the MEV gun and Dr Pierce prepares to [[Extra-vehicular activity|leave the vehicle]] to collect samples. However, the other formations stir into motion and reveal themselves to be [[List of one-eyed creatures|one-eyed]] "Rock Snakes". Under attack from the extraterrestrials, which are able to shoot fireballs from their "mouths", the ''Zero-X'' explorers are forced to effect a premature departure from the Martian surface. Docking with the orbiting command module piloted by Space Navigator Brad Newman, the astronauts start the flight back to Earth.

As ''Zero-X'' [[Atmospheric reentry|re-enters]] Earth's atmosphere on September 2,<ref group="notes" name="Dates"/> a [[lifting body]] launched to assist the controlled descent fails to interface, damaging the escape pod circuit. With ''Zero-X'' locked in descent and set to impact Craigsville, [[Florida]],<ref group="notes" name="Craigsville">Craigsville is located in [[Florida]] (Archer and Nicholls, 116; Archer and Hearn, 140) and landscape scenes shot in [[Portugal]] for the climax of ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' are intended to represent that area.</ref> Jeff sends out Scott and [[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Brains]] in ''Thunderbird 1'' and Virgil, Alan and [[Gordon Tracy|Gordon]] in ''Thunderbird 2''. Winched into ''Zero-X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s undercarriage, Alan must risk being trapped onboard the spacecraft as Brains advises him on re-routing the damaged escape circuit. With Craigsville evacuated, Alan is left seconds to detach his cable, and Travers and the others eject just in time, before ''Zero-X'' crashes spectacularly into Craigsville. Collected by Penelope and Parker in FAB1, Alan is driven to the real Swinging Star and Penelope, joined by the Tracy family, Brains and [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]], all disguised to conceal their identities, propose a toast to Alan as the "hero of the day".

==Production==
When shooting on Series One of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' wrapped in late 1965, [[Gerry Anderson]] and his [[ITC Entertainment|ITC]] financier, [[Lew Grade]], agreed that a feature film adaptation, to be shot at the same time as the prospective Series Two, would be the next logical step in the expansion of the [[AP Films]] ''Thunderbirds'' franchise.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 31.</ref><ref name="Fanderson">{{cite web|url= http://www.fanderson.org.uk/prodguides/movies.html#Film%20Two|title=Feature Film Productions|work=[[Fanderson|fanderson.org.uk]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080221134355/http://www.fanderson.org.uk/prodguides/movies.html#Film%20Two|archivedate={{Start date|2008|02|21}}|accessdate={{Start date|2010|04|10}}|deadurl=no}}</ref> With [[United Artists]] contracted to distribute the film and the [[Rank Organisation]] to exhibit,<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 115">Archer and Nicholls, 115.</ref> a budget of <U+00A3>250,000 was set<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 137"/> and Anderson and his wife, [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia]], commenced work on the script at a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] villa<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131.</ref> rented to them by Grade.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 138">Archer and Hearn, 138.</ref> The couple decided to base the plot on the American-Soviet "[[Space Race]]", in particular the 1960s contest to land astronauts on the [[Moon]], but adapt this story for the futuristic ''Thunderbirds'' universe by changing the destination of the mission to [[Mars]].<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/><ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 115"/> In the [[pre-production]] stages of their next puppet series, ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', the Andersons would opt to script a second appearance of the ''[[Zero-X]]'' spacecraft to link the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]] of ''Thunderbirds'' and its sequel, which is supposed to be set in the same [[fictional universe]].<ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 59">Bentley: ''Captain Scarlet'', 59.</ref> ''Captain Scarlet'' would also prove to be a progression from ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' in terms of its depiction of extraterrestrial [[life on Mars]], although the [[Mysteron]] antagonists of this series would be more ambitious than the Rock Snakes of the film by actively seeking to attack [[Earth]].<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 115"/>

*'''[[Jeremy Wilkin]]''' as '''[[Virgil Tracy]]'''. The only character whose voice actor was changed between Series One and ''Thunderbirds Are Go'', since [[David Holliday]] had returned to the United States in the interim,<ref name="Fanderson"/><ref name="Archer and Hearn, 138"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 33">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 33.</ref><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 139">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 139.</ref> the film and Series Two version of Virgil was voiced by Wilkin, an English-born Canadian actor who emigrated back to London in the 1960s.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 138"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 33"/> Wilkin would maintain a professional relationship with the Andersons for seven years after the film, voicing the character of Captain Ochre in ''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'', supporting roles in ''[[Joe 90]]'' and also the character of The Bishop for ''[[The Secret Service]]'', before minor appearances in two of the [[live-action]] Anderson productions of the 1970s, ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' and ''[[The Protectors]]''.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 33"/>
*'''[[Paul Maxwell]]''' as ''[[Zero-X]]'' Captain '''Paul Travers'''. Maxwell, a Canadian actor who often played American characters in 1960s British television, also provided voices for ''Thunderbirds'' Series Two and voiced the character of [[Captain Grey]] for several episodes of ''Captain Scarlet''.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 34">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 34.</ref> His previous acting for the Andersons had come in 1963 with ''[[Fireball XL5]]'', as the star character Captain Steve Zodiac.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 34"/>
*'''Alexander Davion''' as Space Captain '''Greg Martin'''. A French-born actor with experience on ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' and ''[[Gideon's Way]]'' (in the role of Chief Inspector David Keen), Davion made one guest appearance on ''UFO'' in the 1970s.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 35.</ref>
*'''[[Bob Monkhouse]]''' as Space Navigator '''Brad Newman'''. Monkhouse, an actor in such films as ''[[Carry On Sergeant]]'' (1958), would later host the British game show ''[[The Golden Shot]]'' between 1967 and 1972.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 34"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> He first approached Gerry Anderson for permission to film a [[comedy sketch]] based on ''[[Stingray (TV series)|Stingray]]'',<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 138"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 138">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 138.</ref> but ended up agreeing to replace [[Alfred Marks]], who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 138"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> Monkhouse recalled the conversation: "[Anderson] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?'

*'''[[Neil McCallum (actor)|Neil McCallum]]''' as Dr '''Ray Pierce'''. With a role in the 1956 children's series ''Space School'', after ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' Canadian actor McCallum made contributions to ''Captain Scarlet'', ''UFO'', ''The Protectors'' and (beyond the Anderson productions) ''[[Department S]]'' and ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)]]''.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/>

*'''[[Cliff Richard]]''' as '''Cliff Richard Jr'''. Contracted in Portugal, where he owned a house "next-door-but-one"<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, after negotiations with his agent, [[Peter Gormley]],<ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 116"/> singer Richard says of his casting that he was "thrilled"<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> to be part of the well-known and popular ''Thunderbirds'' franchise. Richard has fond memories of the making of his Supermarionation lookalike puppet: "It was quite a hoot ... I was never really sure if I looked like my puppet or it looked like me."<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/>
*'''[[The Shadows]]''' ([[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]], [[Hank Marvin]], [[John Rostill]] and [[Bruce Welch]]) as '''Themselves''', complementing Cliff Richard Jr in [[Alan Tracy]]'s [[dream sequence]] set at The Swinging Star. Bennett remembers the puppet that was based on his likeness: "The first thing I did was to ask if I could keep him when filming was finished, but apparently he was to be turned into another character after the film had been finished."<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/>

===Filming===
[[Pre-production]] for ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' lasted three months, and a [[shooting schedule]] of sixteen weeks was allotted to coincide with the filming of episodes for Series Two.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/> [[Principal photography]] commenced on {{Start date|1966|03|03}}<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 137">Archer and Hearn, 137.</ref><ref name="Bentley: Gerry Anderson, 302"/><ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 13">Bentley: ''Captain Scarlet'', 13.</ref> and ended nearly four months later in late June.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 36">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 36.</ref> The [[AP Films]] staff were split into an "A" and a "B" Unit, "A" to concentrate on the film and "B" the television episodes.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 132">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 132.</ref> As a result of the division, henceforth the television shooting would be completed at the rate of one episode per month, whereas Series One had been filmed at a faster rate with the completion of two episodes in the same time.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 36"/> While [[director of photography]] Paddy Seale and [[special effects]] supervisor [[Derek Meddings]] handled ''Thunderbirds Are Go'', camera and effects roles for Series Two were delegated to their assistants, Julien Lugrin and Jimmy Elliott.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/> Two unused buildings on the [[Slough Trading Estate]] were purchased to address the increased demands on the production team,<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/> combining with the pre-existing puppet workshop and [[art department]] and publicity centres to form an AP Films production base of five buildings.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/><ref name="Archer, 59">Archer, 59.</ref> Converted by January 1966,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/> one of these former factory units contained new puppet stages, while the other was dedicated to one large [[sound stage]] on which all model and effects work would be completed.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 31"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 131"/>

===Cinematography===
''Thunderbirds Are Go'' was filmed in widescreen [[Techniscope]], a subset of [[Technicolor]], with an [[aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1.<ref name="Bentley: Gerry Anderson, 302"/> This represented a significant departure from the 4:3 picture used for the television episodes.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 139"/> The [[anamorphic]] lenses of [[Panavision]], a popular system for [[Hollywood]] productions during the 1960s,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 133"/> proved to be unsuitable for special effects shots due to the [[depth of field]] of the cameras.<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 139"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 133"/> Techniscope, on the other hand, could be used in conjunction with [[spherical lens]]es while attaining the "[[Letterbox format|letterbox]]" image of mainstream films that were shot on [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film]].<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 139"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 133"/> All AP Films productions had up to this point been filmed on [[Arriflex]] Cameras,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 133"/> but for the film these were replaced with the [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell]] brand.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 133"/>

{{Quote box|quote=The advantages were great.

===Design===
{{Quote box|quote=I had scripted an ultramodern conference room for the top officials of the Martian Exploration Project around which the film is based ...

The heads of the [[art department]], Bob Bell and [[Keith Wilson (production designer)|Keith Wilson]], divided their efforts so that Bell contributed mostly to the film and Wilson to the Series Two episodes.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> Sets constructed by Bell especially for ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' included the Glenn Field Control Tower and Press Conference Room, the interiors of The Swinging Star, and re-designed versions of various locations on [[Tracy Island]].<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 35"/> The appearance of the Space Exploration Center's Inquiry Room was influenced by [[Sylvia Anderson]], who in her role as producer supervised design aspects<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 135"/> and wanted the light-blue uniforms of the SEC officials to be vividly contrasted with a [[Tangerine (color)|tangerine]] and black [[duotone]] backdrop.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 36"/><ref name="Anderson, 67"/><ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 135"/> Director David Lane recalls that the Inquiry Room scene depicted a panel made up of 20 puppets, an achievement which would not have been possible in one of the ''Thunderbirds'' television episodes due to the smaller budget.<ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 38">Bentley: ''Thunderbirds'', 38.</ref>

Of his approach to directing the film, Lane explains, "''Thunderbirds Are Go'' was done like an episode but on a bigger scale.

The requirement to re-create the various ''Thunderbird'' machines was particularly problematic in the case of ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'',<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 132"/> as Meddings explains: "Unfortunately, its replacement was not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape.

A [[long shot]] of a ''Zero-X'' [[lifting body]] falling through the atmosphere and exploding was the only special effects sequence filmed outside the building.

However, after the splendour of the [[premiere]] and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons departed on a tour of Britain to promote the film<ref name="Anderson, 103"/> it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and [[box office]] revenue poor,<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 144"/><ref name="Bentley: Thunderbirds, 39"/> as Gerry Anderson explains: "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed <U+2014> box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went."<ref name="Archer and Hearn, 144"/> Anderson proposes that the presence of ''Thunderbirds'' on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see ''Thunderbirds'' and think, 'We've seen it on television.'"<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/> Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that <U+2014> firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema."<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 176">La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 176.</ref>

[[Supermarionation]] historian Stephen La Rivi<U+00E8>re suggests that the film also faced competition on its release in 1966 from other new family films such as [[Leslie H. Martinson]]'s ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' and [[James Hill (British director)|James Hill]]'s ''[[Born Free]]''.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/><ref name="Fanderson"/> Reviews were, in general, turning less positive: although the ''Slough Observer'' described the film as "basically a [[Technicolor]] large-screen extension" of its television original, ''[[The Times]]'' was critical, asserting that the plotting and [[characterisation]] handed down from the television episodes were too thin to sustain a film and that the various air- and spacecraft launch sequences were intended less for visual appeal than [[Filler (media)|padding]] to maintain feature length.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/> In his 1993 programme guide to the Anderson productions, [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] comments that ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' is "well-made"<ref name="Peel, 242">Peel, 242.</ref> and that it fulfils its promise to deliver visual spectacle,<ref name="Peel, 244">Peel, 244.</ref> coming off as the more favourable of the two ''Thunderbirds'' films,<ref name="Peel, 244"/> although the plot is partly recycled from the television episodes,<ref name="Peel, 244"/> and the [[dream sequence]] is "painfully silly"<ref name="Peel, 244"/> and "embarrassingly awful".<ref name="Peel, 244"/> La Rivi<U+00E8>re agrees with Peel's view that the [[Thunderbirds machines|''Thunderbird'' machines]] are underused,<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/><ref name="Peel, 244"/> and that the extended model shots<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/> and infrequent appearances from the Tracy family may have been a disappointment to the intended audience of children.<ref name="La Rivi<U+00E8>re, 144"/>
