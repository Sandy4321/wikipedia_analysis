==Baseball==
After returning to Hartford in the early days of professional baseball, Bulkeley formed the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] in 1874.  In 1875, the team featured Hall of Fame pitcher [[Candy Cummings]] and player-manager [[Bob Ferguson (infielder)|Bob "Death to Flying Things" Ferguson]].  In 1876, the NAPBBP was replaced by the [[National League]].  Hartford was one of the charter members and Bulkeley was named the league's first president.  In his only season as president, he targeted illegal gambling, drinking and fan rowdiness.<ref name="HOF">[http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/hofer_bios/Bulkeley_Morgan.htm Morgan Bulkeley biography] - Baseball Hall of Fame web site.  Retrieved on 2006-12-31.</ref> After the season, he was replaced as president by [[William Hulbert]].  Bulkeley was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1937|1937]], 15 years after his death. He was also one of the seven members of the [[Abraham G. Mills#The Mills Commission|Mills Commission]] formed by [[Albert Spalding]], the group that gave credence to the myth that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented [[baseball]].<ref name="HOFMills">{{cite web

==Politics==
Bulkeley's short career as a baseball executive coincided with the beginning of his political career.  From 1874 to 1876, he served on the Hartford Common Council<ref>[http://www.hartford.gov/government/council/ Court of Common Council<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.hartford.gov</ref> and the Board of [[Alderman|Aldermen]].<ref name="CTLib" /><ref name="CongBio">[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B001044 Biography] at the ''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]''.  Retrieved on 2006-12-31.</ref>  When [[Thomas O. Enders]] resigned Aetna's presidency due to ill health in 1879, Bulkeley became the company's third president.<ref name="AetnaHistory" />  In 1880, Bulkeley ran for both Mayor of Hartford and Governor of Connecticut.  He lost the gubernatorial race but won the mayoral race and was Hartford's mayor from 1880 to 1888.<ref name="CTLib" /> As mayor he became known for his flamboyant generosity; for instance, arranging steamboat trips on the [[Connecticut River]] for underprivileged children, using his own money.<ref name="al">"[http://aetnet.aetna.com/newsdata/aetna_news/an_20030428_084903.html Aetna Legends: Morgan G. Bulkeley]", Aetna, May 2, 2003</ref>

While mayor of Hartford, on February 11, 1885, Bulkeley married Fannie Briggs Houghton in [[San Francisco]], California.  They had two sons and a daughter.<ref name="CTLib" />

In 1888, Bulkeley again ran for governor.  In the election, [[Luzon B. Morris]] accumulated more votes than Bulkeley but neither had the required 50%.  In accordance with the rules of the time, the state legislature decided the winner and the largely Republican body chose Bulkeley.<ref name="CTLib" />  Although he did not run in 1890, the vote was so close<ref name="GovCTBook" /> and fell into such disarray due to [[ballot irregularities]] in Bridgeport that officials did not certify the results, and the Connecticut House and Senate, each led by opposing parties, could not agree on a legal successor. When Bulkeley refused to recognize the Democratic candidate as the victor, the Democratic state [[comptroller]] changed the lock on an anteroom that led from the governor's office to the Statehouse. When Bulkeley found the door locked the next morning, he broke in with a [[crowbar]], earning the nickname the "Crow-Bar Governor". Bulkeley remained in office two more years, and the state Supreme Court unanimously held that he had been the lawful governor for the disputed period of time.<ref name="al"/>

Bulkeley later served one term in the U.S. Senate from 1905 to 1911, as part of the "[[Millionaires' Senate]]" of 1906, so named for the wealth of its members.<ref name="AetnaHistory"/>

==Death and legacy==
Morgan Bulkeley died in Hartford at age 84.   At the time of his death, Bulkeley had been the president of Aetna for 43 years and had increased its assets from $25.7&nbsp;million to $207&nbsp;million and from 29 to 1,500 employees. Under his guidance, Aetna had been transformed from a life insurance company into a company that offered accident, health, automobile,workers compensation, and group insurance. He was succeeded by his nephew, Morgan Brainard, who led Aetna for the following 35 years.<ref name="AetnaHistory" /><ref name="al"/>

The Hartford Bridge over the [[Connecticut River]] was renamed the [[Bulkeley Bridge]] in his honor after his death.<ref name="Bridge">[http://www.past-inc.org/historic-bridges/stone-bulkeley.html Bulkeley Bridge, Bridge No. 980A] - Connecticut's Historic Masonry Arches.  Retrieved on 2006-12-31.</ref>
