== Notes ==
*{{fnb|1}}While the original version of "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" was performed by [[The Arrows]], the cover version in Guitar Hero is based on the cover of that song made famous by [[Joan_Jett#Joan_Jett_and_The_Blackhearts|Joan Jett and the Blackhearts]], based on the in-game information for this song.
*{{fnb|2}}Based on in-game information for the [[Judas Priest]] song "[[You've Got Another Thing Comin']]", the game incorrectly credits the song title as "You Got Another Thing Comin'".
*{{fnb|3}}While the original version of "[[Higher Ground]]" was performed by [[Stevie Wonder]], the cover version in ''Guitar Hero'' is based on the cover of that song made famous by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|The Red Hot Chili Peppers]], based on the in-game information for this song.
*{{fnb|4}}The group "Artillery" has since changed their name to "Breaking Wheel"
