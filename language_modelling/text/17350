The '''Silverton Tramway''' was an [[Australia]]n 56 kilometre long {{3ft6in}} [[narrow gauge railway]] running from [[Cockburn, South Australia|Cockburn]] on the [[South Australia]]n state border to [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] in [[New South Wales]]. Operating between 1888 and 1970 it served the mines of Broken Hill, and formed the link between the standard gauge [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and the narrow gauge [[South Australian Railways]].<ref name="nrm">{{cite web

==History==
===Inception===
The Silverton Tramway was conceived as a way to transport ore from the newly discovered ore deposits at [[Silverton, New South Wales|Silverton]], to the smelters at [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]], with the line later extended to Broken Hill with the discovery of that field.<ref name="par">{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-03-05 }}</ref> The need for a private line was in part due to the NSW Government refusing to allow the South Australian Railways to complete their narrow gauge link across the border.<ref name="nrm" /> The ''Silverton Tramway Act'' was passed by New South Wales in 1886 permitting the narrow gauge line to be built.<ref name="rjf">{{cite web

Once opened major traffics on the line included passengers, livestock, bullion, ore and concentrates.<ref name="par"/> In 1913 844,477 tons of ore and concentrates were carried on the tramway and another 843,307 tons of other goods including coke, coal, timber, crude oil and livestock,<ref name="barrier"/> and by 1933 twenty [[steam locomotive]]s were owned by the company, along with 660 goods wagons. Passenger services were operated by the South Australian Railways, who paid the Company to access the line,<ref name=barrier/> the main passenger terminal in Broken Hill being at Sulphide Street.<ref name=abc>{{cite web

===Gauge conversion===
After the completion of the [[Trans-Australian Railway]], the Silverton Tramway and the South Australian line to [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]] was a missing link in an unbroken [[Sydney]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] rail journey. (Perth to [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia]] was the other.) Moves towards conversion of the line to standard gauge were made with the passing of the Railway Standardisation Agreement Act of 1944, in which the NEw South Wales government would acquire the Silverton Tramway Company, then pass it to the South Australian Railway Commissioner.<ref name="rjf"/> This agreement lapsed, with a new one made in 1949 in which the Commonwealth would be responsible for the acquistion. 

The New South Wales government did not wish the Company to remain as a mine line operator, or to purchase it themselves; while South Australian train crews were not happy to work trains across the state border due to a loss of favourable industrial conditions.<ref name="rjf"/> By 1967 the Silverton Tramway Company offered to build a standard gauge line for a fixed sum, and transfer the line to New South Wales soon after. This line would run from Cockburn to Broken Hill on an alignment that had some interaction with the existing Crystal Street station, but the Commonwealth Government rejected it as they wished for the line to be built on a totally new alignment away from the Company lines.<ref name="rjf"/> By 1968 South Australia believed that they would have gauge converted their portion of the line before the short section to Broken Hill was even finished.

===Demise===
The standard gauge line was finally opened in 1970 on a new alignment which lead directly to the New South Wales operated Crystal Street station, taking one year and over $2 million more than if the the Silverton proposal was carried out.<ref name="rjf"/> The Silverton Tramway Company's business was lost to [[Australian National]] who had taken over the South Australian and [[Commonwealth Railways]], with the company closing its narrow gauge shortline business, and returning the permanent way to the Crown.<ref name="pc">{{cite web

The company then reinvented itself as [[Silverton Rail]], a short haul rail operator servicing the mining industry in and around Broken Hill. Since 1886 the company hauled some 90 million tonnes of bulk and general freight and 2.8 million passengers over an aggregate of 19 million kilometres.<ref name="pc"/>
