'''Doubleday Field''' is a small [[baseball]] [[stadium]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] named for [[Abner Doubleday]] and located two city blocks from the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]].

The grounds have been used for baseball since 1920, on what was [[Elihu Phinney]]'s farm. A wooden grandstand was built in 1924, later replaced by a steel and concrete grandstand built in [[1939]] by the [[Works Progress Administration|Works Project Administration]].<ref>{{cite web | title =12 WPA Projects that Still Exist | work =How Stuff Works | publisher =Publications International, Ltd. | url =http://people.howstuffworks.com/12-wpa-projects-that-still-exist.htm | accessdate =2009-03-11}}</ref> Subsequent expansion has increased [[seating capacity]] to 9,791 spectators.<ref>[http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/news/2005/050906.htm]</ref>

Each year from 1940 to 2008, Doubleday Field hosted the Hall of Fame Game. Originally a contest between "old-timers" teams, it later became an [[exhibition game]] between two [[Major League Baseball|major league]] squads. Traditionally, the game was held during the annual induction weekend of the nearby Baseball Hall of Fame, but in later years it was scheduled in May or June, to accommodate the participating teams' travel schedules. As MLB's last remaining in-season exhibition game, its results did not count in the official standings, and substitute players were generally used to avoid injury to starters. 

On January 29, 2008, Major League Baseball announced that the final Hall of Fame Game would be played on June 16, 2008 between the Chicago Cubs and San Diego Padres, citing "the inherent challenges" of scheduling teams in the modern day as the reason for ending the annual contest.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/wires/01/29/2010.ap.bbo.hall.of.fame.game.0131/</ref> However, the contest was canceled on account of rain.<ref>{{cite news | first=John | last=Kekis | coauthors= | title= Final Hall of Fame Game canceled by rain | date=[[2008-06-18]] | publisher=[[Yahoo!

In November 2008, the Hall of Fame and the MLB Players Alumni Association announced the creation of the Hall of Fame Classic, an exhibition game involving Hall of Famers and other retired MLB players to be played on [[Father's Day]] weekend. The inaugural Hall of Fame Classic is scheduled for Sunday, June 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jack | last=O'Connell | title=New Hall tradition to feature legends | date=[[2008-11-17]] | publisher=[[MLB.com]] | url=http://mlbpaa.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081117&content_id=3682156&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb | accessdate=[[2009-04-01]]}}</ref>

==Other uses==
Doubleday Field is used primarily for amateur and [[American Legion]] ball; The "Legends of Baseball" rents out Doubleday 3 weeks over the summer. No professional team has ever called the stadium home, although in 1996 the [[Northeast League]] considered placing a franchise in Cooperstown. The idea was rejected: Doubleday Field has no lights, a necessity for a team in a pro league. Also, some felt that Cooperstown should be the home of ''all'' baseball, and not just one team. The [[New York-Penn League]] has played an annual regular-season game at Doubleday Field since [[1991]] with the nearby [[Oneonta Tigers]] serving as the home team.<ref>{{cite news | first=Samantha | last=Carr | coauthors= | title=Oneonta, Tri-City to Square Off at Doubleday Field | date=[[2008-07-23]] | publisher=[[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] | url =http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080723&content_id=8235&vkey=hof_news | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-07-28 | language = }}</ref>
