'''June Mathis''' ([[June 30]] [[1889]] <U+2013> [[July 26]] [[1927]]) was one of the most influential [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter|screenwriters]] and among the highest paid [[Hollywood]] executives in the 1920s.<ref name="AltFilm"> Alt Film Guide.</ref> She was also one of the first "writer-directors"<ref name="dark">Leider, 2004.</ref> and laid the groundwork for the later development of screenwriters becoming producers.<ref name="acker">Acker. 1991. p.164</ref> The [[American Film Institute]] catalogue credits her with 113 films in a 12 year career; among them ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'', ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'', and ''[[Blood and Sand]]''. She was the first female executive for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro/MGM]] and in 1926 was voted the third most influential woman in all of Hollywood; behind only [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Norma Talmadge]].<ref name="Journal">Journal of Humanities. 2007.</ref>

==Early life== 
Born '''June Beulah Hughes''' in [[Leadville]], [[Colorado]], the only child of Virginia Ruth and Dr. Philip Hughes.  Her family had nine previous generations of doctors, lawyers and college professors. Her great uncle was the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of one of the oldest colleges in [[England]].{{fact|April 208}} Her parents divorced when she was seven and her mother remarried William D. Mathis, a widower with three children. June would eventually take her stepfather's name as a stage name.

===Theatre===
Mathis was educated in [[Salt Lake City]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was while in San Francisco, she got her first stage experience dancing and doing imitations in [[vaudeville]]. At the age of twelve she joined a traveling company and at seventeen became an ingenue, performing with Ezra Kendall in ''The Vinegar Buyer''.<ref name="dark"/> Later she appeared in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows and toured for four seasons with the [[female impersonator]] [[Julian Eltinge]] in the widely popular show ''The Fascinating Widow''. She would perform in theatre for the next thirteen years.<ref name="dark"/>

==Screenwriting==
Mathis took a writing course in [[New York]] and won a screen writing contest. Her first script, ''House of Tears'', would be directed by Edwin Carewe in 1915 and led to a contract in 1918 with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro]] studios, later known as MGM.<ref name="dark"/> As one of the first screenwriters to include details such as stage directions and physical settings in her work, Mathis saw scenarios as a way to make movies into more of an art form. Much of the present standard [[screen writing]] styles can be attributed to her.

By 1919 Mathis and her mother had moved to Hollywood. After only a year of screenwriting, she had advanced to the head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro's]] [[scriptwriting|scenario]] department.<ref name="Maher">Maher. 2006. p.200</ref> She was one of the first heads of any film department and the only female executive at Metro.<ref name="dark"/>

===Themes in work===
Mathis had very liberal beliefs, having grown up around theater performers as well as working with Eltinge. Due to these experiences Mathis had a tolerant view of alternative lifestyles. ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' had a scene with an apparent [[lesbian]] couple in the background. It also features a scene with [[Germany|German]] officers coming down the stairs in drag. Mathis told ''The Los Angeles Times'' of the scene, "I had the German officers coming down the stairs with women's clothing on. To hundreds of people that meant no more than a masquerade party. To those who have lived and read, and who understand life, that scene stood out as one of the most terrific things in the picture."<ref name="Journal"/>

At a time when [[Douglas Fairbanks]] was the epitome of [[manhood]] Mathis wrote scripts that featured more realistic themes and featured a more sensitive leading man with Valentino.<ref name="Journal"/> Fairbank's did not like doing love scenes and his movies tended to be of a boyish nature. With his movies a man was out in the wild discovering himself and saving the day. With Mathis' scripts such as ''Blood and Sand'' she brought out a more realistic male portrayal with her main character being conflicted over providing for his family, and possibly losing his life. Many of her scripts focused on a maturing male.<ref name="Journal"/> In addition to her other themes ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' was one of the first movie with an [[anti-war]] theme.<ref name="Journal"/>

==Executive==
Mathis' position with Metro was called by the Los Angeles Times, "The Most Responsible Job ever Held by A Woman".<ref name=LATIMES, 1923">LA Times, 1923.</ref> She was arguably one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, even said to be as powerful as [[Mary Pickford]]). Mathis had influence over casting, choice of director and many other aspects of production.<ref name="Maher"/> Her strength lay in careful preparation of the shooting script along with the director, cutting out waste in production while at the same time sharpening narrative continuity.<ref name="stjames">Unterberger. 1999. p.270</ref>

===Greed===
Mathis continued to survive in Hollywood despite being involved in two of the greatest fiasco's of the 1920s. When [[Erich von Stroheim]] presented the studio with his masterpiece ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', following [[Frank Norris]]'s novel [[McTeague]] pretty closely, it was forty-two reels and ten hours long. Stroheim himself reduced it to 24 reels (six hours), hoping the film could be screened with intermissions in two successive evenings. But the studio demanded further cuts. Stroheim allowed his close friend [[Rex Ingram]] to reduce it to 18 reels (4<U+00BD> hours), but Mathis was instructed by Metro to cut the film even more, which she assigned to a routine cutter, Joseph W. Farnham.<ref name="stjames"/> The film was then reduced to thirteen reels (2<U+00BD> hours) long.<ref name="Koszarski"> Koszarski. 1983. p. 144-5</ref> There is speculation on whether Mathis took part in the actual cutting, however her name was listed in the credits and it was she who would be blamed for what Stroheim and his fans would call "tampering with his genius".<ref name="Maher"/> In fact Mathis had worked with Stroheim before and had been fond of his themes, and thus it would be unlikely she would butcher his film unnecessarily.<ref name="Journal">Journal of Humanities</ref>

===Ben-Hur===
For the 1924 production of ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben Hur]]'', Mathis  fought the studio for many months, over the casting and production. It was her idea to film the one million dollar script in Italy, the film would eventually come in just under four million dollars. When she arrived the original director [[Charles Barbin]], in his words, refused to let her "interfere". The production troubles were numerous, and due to political troubles engulfing Italy at the time, resulted disputes and delayed permissions. When the sea battle was filmed near Livorno, Italy, many extras had apparently lied about being able to swim. The first attempt to film the chariot race was on a set in Rome, but there were problems with shadows and the racetrack surface. Then one of the chariots' wheels came apart and the stuntman driving it was thrown in the air and killed.

MGM inherited the production when it took over control of Goldwyn studios, with the film over budget and getting out of control, the studio halted production and relocated the shoot from Italy to California, under the supervision of Irving Thalberg. Before they had even returned from Italy, MGM would fire Mathis, Barbin and the star.<ref name="Maher"/>

===Later career===
Upon her return from Italy, [[First National]] hired her as editorial director. She also scripted several successful [[Colleen Moore]] pictures including ''Sally'', ''The Desert Flower'', and ''Irene''. After 2 years she left First National over limitations and signed with [[United Artists]]. She made one picture for them before her death ''The Masked Woman'' with her husband.<ref name="dark"/>

During her 12 year career in Hollywood, Mathis wrote scripts for over 112 films. She was regarded as one of the best screenwriters of her time and was highly sought after. Mathis' spiritual beliefs often were found in her scripts. Several of her scripts had [[mystical]] bents or redeeming themes to them such as ''The Young Rajah''.<ref name="dark"/>

At the age of 35 she was the highest paid executive in all of Hollywood. In 1926 she was voted the third most influential woman in Hollywood.<ref name="Journal"/>

==Valentino==
Mathis is probably best known for discovering [[Rudolph Valentino]] after seeing him in a bit part in ''[[The Eyes of Youth']]''. In 1921 she cast him in her adaptation of ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse''.<ref name="Maher"/> [[Vicente Blasco Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez]]'s novel had been considered unadaptable by every major studio in the country, but somehow Mathis persuaded [[Richard Rowland]], the head of Metro to pay twenty thousand dollars for the rights. Mathis also exerted considerable influence to cast Valentino, as studio heads resisted hiring the unknown actor for a lead role.<ref name="dark"/> However, Mathis' insistence paid off and the movie was a success, and launched Valentino into stardom. It became one of the most commercial silent films ever made. Thanks to the efforts of June Mathis.<ref name="Slater">Slater. 1984 p.246</ref> For the same movie she also insisted the studio hire [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]] as director.<ref name="Maher"/> Valentino did not get along with Ingram or Metro, leading to his transfer to [[Famous Players-Lasky]].

After spending seven years at Metro,  Famous Players-Lasky (later known as [[Paramount Pictures]]) was able to lure her away with the promise that she could continue to write for her prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> Valentino. When Valentino moved to [[Goldwyn Pictures]] she did as well, this time gaining sovereign control.

Mathis and Rudolph Valentino remained fast friends after ''Four Horsemen''. While their relationship was never believed to be romantic in nature, there is evidence from both sides that the two enjoyed a very strong and loving platonic friendship. Accounts state that Valentino regarded Mathis in a motherly way, calling her 'Little Mother,' and that she thought of him as a son (despite only being 8 years older). [[Nita Naldi]], who worked with the pair on ''Blood and Sand'', said of them, "She mothered Rudy, and my dear she worshiped him and he worshiped her".<ref name="dark"/> "She discovered me, anything I have accomplished I owe to her, to her judgment, to her advice and to her unfailing patience and confidence in me," said Valentino on Mathis.{{fact|April 2008}}

Mathis and Valentino were close friends. Mathis looked after Valentino's welfare during his time at Metro, making sure he got the best parts and was taken care of. She was also one of the people who helped bail him out of jail when he was arrested for [[bigamy]] when he married [[Natacha Rambova]] without finalizing his divorce to [[Jean Acker]]. Though the two were inseparable, their relationship became strained during Valentino's marriage to Rambova. When Mathis submitted a script for ''The Hooded Falcon'', one of Valentino's pet projects, the couple deemed it unacceptable and asked to have rewritten. Mathis took it as a great insult and broke off all contact with Valentino.<ref name="dark"/>

==Personal life==
Mathis was known as a short woman with untamed brown hair and a love of [[Paris, France|Parisian]] fashion. She had a famous temper and an unbending will. She was driven and would do all she could if she was convinced she was right.<ref name="dark"/> Mathis was a [[spiritualist]] with [[mystical]] bents. Her scripts featured many heroes with a Christ like demeanor. She believed in [[reincarnation]] and always wore an [[opal]] ring when she wrote, convinced it brought her ideas. She had been a sickly child and believed she healed herself through her sheer force of will. She believed everything was mental and everyone had certain vibrations stating, '"If you are vibrating on the right plane, you will inevitably come in contact with the others who can help you. It's like tuning in on your radio. If you get the right wave-length, you have your station."'<ref name="dark"/>

Mathis had been romantically linked to [[George Walsh]] and [[Rex Ingram]], however she returned from Italy engaged to an Italian cinematographer named 'Sylvano Balboni' (sometimes spelled as Silvano Balboni). The pair married [[December 20]] [[1924]] at Mission of St. Cecilia, in [[Riverside, CA]].

===Death===
After Valentino's marriage with Rambova ended in 1925, the two friends reconciled at the premiere of ''Son of the Sheik'' when Valentino spotted Mathis with friends. It was said to be a tearful reunion and the pair began to act as if old times.<ref name="Ellenberger"/> As Valentino began to feel ill in 1926 she was by his side and encouraged him to slow down and take some rest. True to her belief in the supernatural, Mathis reported seeing an apparition of Valentino in her living room the night he died.<ref name="dark"/>
 
When Valentino unexpectedly died in August 1926 Mathis was said to offer the most touching quote by saying:<blockquote>"My long association with Rudolph Valentino endeared him to me, as he has become endeared to everyone who knew him, my heart is too full of sorrow at this moment to enable me to speak coherently. I only know that his passing has left a void that nothing can ever fill in that the loss to our industry is too great to estimate at this time."<ref name="Ellenberger">Ellenberger. 2005.</ref></blockquote>

Due to estate issues Valentino was left without a burial place, so Mathis offered up what she thought would be a temporary solution: to lend him her spot in the family crypt she had purchased in Hollywood Memorial Cemetery (now called the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]]). However, when Mathis herself died the following year, the arrangement became permanent.

On July 27, 1927, during the third act of the Broadway show ''The Squall'', while accompanied by her grandmother Mathis suffered a fatal heart attack. Her last words were reportedly "Oh Mother I'm dying!", which has led to confusion over who she was with at the time of her death as her mother had passed a few years prior. Mathis was 39 years old.<ref name="Ellenberger"/>

Her ashes were returned to California, instead of 'evicting' Valentino, Mathis' husband, Sylvano Balboni, moved Valentino to the niche beside hers, sold the remaining crypt to Valentino's family and returned to Italy. Mathis and Valentino repose side by side to this day.
