The '''Invasion of <U+00CE>le de France''' was a complicated but successful [[amphibious operation]] in November 1810 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the operation, a substantial British military force was landed by the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Grand Baie]] on [[Mauritius|<U+00CE>le de France]]. Marching inland against weak French opposition, the British force was able to overwhelm the defenders in a series of minor engagements, culminating in the capture of the island's capital [[Port Napoleon]] and the surrender of [[Charles Decaen]], the French governor. The surrender eliminated the last French territory in the [[Indian Ocean]] and among the military equipment captured were five [[French Navy]] [[frigates]] and 209 heavy [[cannon]]. <U+00CE>le de France was retained by Britain at the end of the war under the name of [[Mauritius]] and remained part of the [[British Empire]] until 1968.

The operation was the culmination of two years of conflict over the island and the neighbouring [[<U+00CE>le Bourbon]] between frigate squadrons commanded by [[Josias Rowley]] and [[Jacques Hamelin]]. Hamelin repeatedly raided British trade convoys and Rowley responded with amphibious assaults on French harbours, capturing but neither had gained ascendancy by the time Rowley sent most of his force to attack the port of [[Grand Port]] on <U+00CE>le de France in August 1810. At the ensuing [[Battle of Grand Port|battle]] the British squadron was destroyed and Hamelin began to blockade Rowley on <U+00CE>le Bourbon. As British reinforcements were urgently despatched, several actions were fought between recently arrived British ships and the more numerous French forces. At the last of these on [[Action of 18 September 1810|18 September 1810]], Hamelin was defeated and captured by Rowley. This allowed Rowley to build his forces over the next two months until they were sufficient for a successful invasion, which was led by the recently arrived Admiral [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]].

==Background==
The [[Indian Ocean]] had been an important strategic region for British trade since the first British trading posts were developed in [[India]]. By the [[Napoleonic Wars]], millions of [[pound sterling|pounds]] worth of goods crossed the ocean's trade routes every year, mostly in the heavily guarded convoys of [[East Indiamen]].<ref name="RG92">Gardiner, p. 92</ref> The French recognised the economic importance of these convoys but until 1808 failed to provide sufficient forces to disrupt the Indian trade. Late in 1808, it was decided to send a strong [[frigate]] squadron to the Ocean under the command of [[Jacques Hamelin]] to augment the forces available on the island bases of [[<U+00CE>le Bonaparte]] and [[Mauritius|<U+00CE>le de France]] and raid British shipping in the region. Hamelin was an able commander and between May 1809 and July 1810 his ships captured seven East Indiamen and a large number of small merchant ships and warships.<ref name="RG93">Gardiner, p. 93</ref>

The British response to Hamelin's deployment was provided by Admiral [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]], who collected a squadron of ships from those available at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and placed them under the command of Commodore [[Josias Rowley]].<ref name="WJ192-195">James, Vol. 5, p. 192&ndash;195</ref> Bertie gave Rowley instructions to blockade the islands and prepare for invasion attempts once the required forces could be spared. During 1809 and the spring of 1810, Rowley maintained the blockade and launched a series of small raids, the largest being [[Raid on Saint Paul|at Saint Paul]] on <U+00CE>le Bonaparte in September 1809. By July 1810, Rowley had developed sufficient forces at his island base on [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodriguez]] to successfully [[Invasion of <U+00CE>le Bonaparte|invade and capture]] <U+00CE>le Bonaparte, which he restored to its former name of <U+00CE>le Bourbon.<ref name="WJ272">James, Vol. 5, p. 272</ref> In August, Rowley attempted to extend his blockade of <U+00CE>le de France by seizing small islands off the main ports that could control the passage of shipping through the coral reefs that surround the island. The first operation was to capture [[<U+00CE>le de la Passe]] off [[Grand Port]], which was successfully secured on 13 August. Shortly afterwards a French squadron forced passage into the harbour and Captain [[Samuel Pym]] ordered the four frigates of the blockade squadron to attack the ships anchored in the bay. The ensuing [[Battle of Grand Port]] was a disaster for the British, as two frigates were wrecked on the reefs and two others captured with their entire crews: only the very seriously wounded, including Captain [[Nesbit Willoughby]], were repatriated to <U+00CE>le Bourbon.<ref name="WJ295">James, Vol. 5, p. 295</ref>

With his squadron reduced to a single frigate, Rowley sent urgent messages  to the British bases at [[Madras]] and [[Cape Town]] requesting reinforcements. The naval authorities instantly responded by sending those forces immediately available to <U+00CE>le Bourbon. The first two frigates to arrive, [[HMS Africaine (1801)|HMS ''Africaine'']] and [[HMS Bombay (1805)|HMS ''Ceylon'']] were both attacked while sailing alone and captured by Hamelin's squadron, which was now blockading <U+00CE>le Bourbon. Rowley was able to recapture both ships within hours of their loss, and was also able to seize Hamelin and his flagship [[French frigate V<U+00E9>nus (1808)|''V<U+00E9>nus'']] at the [[Action of 18 September 1810]].<ref name="RW293">Woodman, p. 293</ref> The loss of the French naval commander was a serious blow to the squadron on <U+00CE>le de France, which was also beset by supply problems resulting from a lack of naval stores and food supplies. Unable to make the lengthy cruises needed to disrupt the Indian Ocean trade routes, they were forced to remain in harbour as Rowley was heavily reinforced during September and October 1810.<ref name="WJ324">James, Vol. 5, p. 324</ref>

==Planning==
The invasion of <U+00CE>le de France, although prompted by the defeat at Grand Port, had been the ultimate intention of Rowley's squadron since its creation in 1809 and had been planned carefully both on a strategic level by Bertie at [[Cape Town]] and [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]] at Madras and on a tactical level by Rowley and his [[British Army]] counterpart Lieutenant-Colonel [[Henry Sheehy Keating|Henry Keating]] on Rodriguez.<ref name="RG96">Gardiner, p. 96</ref> The transport ships and soldiers would come from the Indian garrison, to be led by General [[John Abercromby (British Army officer)|John Abercromby]] (although they were also accompanied by Rear-Admiral [[William O'Bryen Drury]]) while the naval forces to protect and support the invasion force were to be provided by Bertie from the Cape of Good Hope. These forces were to gather at Rodriguez in preparation for the invasion.<ref name="WJ324">James, Vol. 5, p. 324</ref> The landings themselves were planned by Rowley and Keating, who replied on Willoughby's intimate knowledge of the coastline of <U+00CE>le de France and a series of careful surveys of the reefs that surrounded the island to select a landing site.<ref name="WJ325">James, Vol. 5, p. 325</ref>

The chosen point was at [[Grand Baie]], on the northwestern coastline approximately {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of the island's capital [[Port Napoleon]]. The intention was to prepare an elite force of 1,555 men formed from the [[Grenadier]] and [[Light infantry|light]] companies of the regiments attached to the invasion. This vanguard would storm ashore and advance rapidly towards the capital closely supported by a naval brigade of sailors and [[Royal Marines]] and followed by the main body of the army, numbering 5,293 soldiers.<ref name="RW292">Woodman, p. 292</ref> The entire force would have logistical assistance and artillery support from Royal Navy ships that would shadow the advance along the coast. The army's orders were to seize Port Napoleon and capture Governor [[Charles Decaen]], which action, it was hoped, would be sufficient to force the surrender of the entire island.<ref name="RG96"/> Subsequent landings would be made to the west of the capital if French resistance was stronger than expected.<ref name="AM39">Macmillan, p. 39</ref>

On 15 October, Bertie arrived at Rodriguez with his squadron from Cape Town. On 3 November troops from the [[Bombay]] garrison arrived, followed on 6 November by the Madras contingent. On Rodriguez the invasion plans were finalised, [[HMS Staunch (1804)|HMS ''Staunch'']] sent to reconnoitre the northern coastline of <U+00CE>le de France to seek a suitable beach.<ref name="WJ325"/> Command of the landing and the naval support role was given to Captain [[Philip Beaver]], who had a reputation as an expert in [[amphibious operations]]. Keating was placed in command of the vanguard of the land force, with Captain [[William Augustus Montagu]] commanding of the naval brigade and Abercromby in overall charge. Rowley would remain offshore in [[HMS Boadicea (1797)|HMS ''Boadicea'']] as would Bertie, who took ''Africaine'' as his flagship.<ref name="WLC294"/>

The French response to the impending British invasion was to mobilise the island's 10,000 strong militia. Despite their large numbers, this force was untrained, poorly armed and poorly motivated. Decaen himself recognised that they would be unreliable in the face of attack by British regular soldiers.<ref name="WLC295">Clowes, p. 295</ref> He also bolstered his forces by attempting to recruit volunteers from among the hundreds of [[prisoners of war]] held in the island's prisons (a principle cause of the food shortages on <U+00CE>le de France). Over 500 volunteers agreed to join his army, the majority of them [[Irish people|Irishmen]] promised French assistance in obtaining Irish independence from Britain.<ref name="RG97"/> Altogether, Decaen could muster 1,300 regular soldiers to defend the capital, which he placed under the command of General [[Edm<U+00E9>-Martin Vandermaesen]].<ref name="RW292"/>

==Invasion==
On 22 November 1810, all the British troops and ships were assembled and Bertie ordered the squadron to rendezvous off Grand Baie, which was reached early on 29 November despite adverse winds.<ref name="WLC294">Clowes, p. 294</ref> The vanguard landed unopposed, their landing craft supported by ship's boats carrying [[cannon]], supplemented by the firepower of the larger ships offshore. Although there was some disruption in the early stages of the attack, by 21:00 the entire vanguard and naval brigades were ashore, Keating advancing on Fort Malartic, the garrison retreating before his advance and blowing up the fort as they left.<ref name="RW292"/> During the morning of 30 November, Keating pushed southwards to the [[Rivi<U+00E8>re du Tombeau|River Tombeau]] which overlooked Port Napoleon, his front units skirmishing with French defenders across the river, during which Decaen himself was lightly wounded by a [[musket]] ball. The bridge over the river had been held by a force of militia, but they fell back before the British advance and failed to properly demolish the bridge, allowing Keating to rapidly cross and threaten Port Napoleon.<ref name="AM39"/> At Grand Baie, the remainder of the invasion force were coming ashore, so that the entire army had landed by midday, although Abercromby himself elected to stay with Beaver on [[HMS Nisus (1810)|HMS ''Nisus'']] and follow the advance from offshore.<ref name="RW293"/>

On 1 December, Vandermaesen made a stand before Port Napoleon, defending the entrance to the town with his available regular troops and some small cannon. Keating attacked him, engaging the French front while a second attack by Madras [[sepoys]] outflanked the French line and disrupted it, allowing a successful frontal assault. With their defences breached the French fell back and on 2 December Decaen proposed a ceasefire, which was accepted.<ref name="WJ326">James, Vol. 5, p. 326</ref> The following day Decaen surrendered, although with guarantees that he and the garrison would be repatriated and allowed to retain their personal arms and [[French Imperial Eagle|Eagles]].<ref name="RW293">Woodman, p. 293</ref> Although some in the British force were unhappy with the terms of the surrender, the British commanders were relieved to have the invasion complete before the [[hurricane]] season began later in the month. The danger to the 70 ships in the British fleet from such a storm was serious and it was vitally important that they were in a safe harbour when the hurricane season began.<ref name="RG97">Gardiner, p. 97</ref>

==Aftermath==
The surrender of <U+00CE>le de France marked the final British operation of the campaign and the capture of the last French territory east of Africa. The island was restored to its pre-1715 name of [[Mauritius]] and the towns renamed under Decaen (such as Port Napoleon) were restored to their pre-[[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] names.<ref name="RW293"/> Governor [[Robert Townsend Farquhar]] of <U+00CE>le Bourbon was placed in administrative control of the island, <U+00CE>le Bourbon taken over by Keating. Although the French garrison was repatriated, the invaders captured six French frigates and several smaller warships in the various harbours of <U+00CE>le de France as well as 24 merchant ships.<ref name="AM40">Macmillan, p. 40</ref> Also seized were the East Indiamen ''Ceylon'', ''Charlton'' and ''United Kingdom'' and 209 heavy cannon. Among the hundreds of prisoners released were the survivors of the Battle of Grand Port and Commander [[Matthew Flinders]], an explorer who had been arrested by Decaen at Port Napoleon eight years earlier and held prisoner despite instructions from [[Napoleon]] himself to release him.<ref name="RW284">Woodman, p. 284</ref> Rewards were forthcoming, particularly for Bertie, who was made a [[baronet]]. This created a scandal when Admiral Drury accused Bertie of taking credit for the work of others (principally Drury himself).<ref name="ODNB">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2272 Bertie, Sir Albemarle], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Stephen Howarth, (subscription required), Retrieved 20 December 2008</ref> Mauritius, unlike <U+00CE>le Bourbon, remained in British hands after the end of the war in 1814 and was retained as part of the [[British Empire]] until granted independence in 1968.

Although there were no further British operations in the region, the Mauritius campaign was not quite over. When news of the victory at Grand Port had reached France, there was pressure to resupply and reinforce the victorious squadron under Hamelin and a small squadron commanded by Commodore [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Roquebert]] was ordered to sail for <U+00CE>le de France. This squadron included three frigates: ''[[HMS Java (1811)|Renomm<U+00E9>e]]'', ''[[French frigate Clorinde (1808)|Clorinde]]'' and ''[[HMS Madagascar (1811)|N<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>ide]]'' and carried extensive stores to repair and rearm Hamelin's frigates.<ref name="WLC486">Clowes, p. 486</ref> The journey from France to the Indian Ocean was a long one, and it was not until February 1811 that Roquebert's squadron arrived at Mauritius. Discovering that the island was in British hands, Roquebert attempted to return to France but was chased by the frigates stationed on Mauritius and captured at the [[Action of 20 May 1811]], only one of his ships escaping the British pursuit.<ref name="WJ15">James, Vol. 6, p. 15</ref>

In addition to the warships, none of which participated in the camapign, Governor [[Charles Decaen]] could muster 1,300 [[French Army]] troops including 500 volunteers from among the British [[prisoners of war]] (predominantley [[Irish people|Irishmen]]) and 10,000 unreliable local militia.
