'''Domestic sheep''' (''Ovis aries'') are [[Quadrupeds|quadrupedal]], [[cloven-hoofed]] [[mammals]] kept as [[livestock]]. Though technically the term "sheep" applies to any species in the genus ''[[Ovis]]'', in everyday use it almost always refers to ''Ovis aries''. Sheep are the most numerous of their genus, and are most likely descended from the wild [[mouflon]]. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for [[agriculture|agricultural]] purposes, they are primarily valued for their[[Wool|fleece]] and meat. A sheep's [[wool]] is the most widely used of any animal, and is typically harvested by [[Sheep shearing|shearing]]. Ovine meat is called [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] when from younger animals and [[Lamb and mutton|mutton]] when from older ones. They continue to be vital livestock today, and are occasionally raised for [[Sheepskin (material)|pelts]], as [[dairy]] animals, and as [[model organism]]s by science. 

[[Sheep husbandry]] is practiced globally, and has played a pivotal role in many civilizations. In the modern era, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Patagonian]] nations, and the [[United Kingdom]] are most closely associated with sheep production. Sheep raising has a large [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lexicon of unique terms]] which alter considerably by region and [[dialect]]. Use of the name "sheep" began in [[Middle English]] as a derivation of the [[Old English]] word ''sc<U+0113>ap''; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, [[herd]] or mob. Adult female sheep are referred to as ewes, intact males as rams, [[Castration|castrated]] males as wethers, and younger sheep as lambs. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age. 

Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and finds representation in much modern language and [[symbology]]. As livestock, sheep are most-often linked to [[pastoral]], [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadian]] imagery. Sheep figure in many [[mythology|mythologies]]&mdash;such as the [[Golden Fleece]]&mdash;and major religions, especially the [[Abrahamic]] traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificial animals]]. In contemporary [[English language]] usage, people who are timid, easily led, or stupid are often compared to sheep.

==Description==
Domestic sheep are [[ruminating]] [[bovid]]s, typically with horns forming a [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] [[spiral]] and [[Crimp (wool)|crimped]] hair called wool. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects. Wild sheep have uncrimped hair and short tails. Some primitive breeds of domestic sheep have such tails, but a long tail seems to have been an early result of domestication. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (polled), or horns in both sexes (as in wild sheep), or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but some may have several more.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> 

Another trait which is unique to ''Ovis aries'' is its wide variation in color. Wild sheep breeds are largely variations of solid [[agouti]] or brown hues. Colors present in domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown and even spotted or [[piebald]].<ref name="rmcsba"/> <ref name="bcsba"/> In contemporary culture, the "fluffy white sheep" is an ubiquitous image. Selection for more easily dye&ndash;able white fleeces began early in the history of sheep domestication, and white wool being a [[dominant trait]] in sheep it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear [[recessive]]ly in entirely white flocks.<ref name="bcsba">{{cite web |url=http://www.bcsba.org.uk/coloured-sheep/coloured-sheep.html |title=An introduction to coloured sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |author= British Coloured Sheep Breeders Association }}</ref> <ref name="rmcsba">{{cite web |url=http://www.rmncsba.org/ |title=Natural Colored Sheep |accessdate=2008-01-05 |author=Rocky Mountain Natural Colored Sheep Breeders Association |date=January 2007 work=Rare Breeds Watchlist }}</ref> While white fleeces are more sought after for large commercial markets, there is an entrenched [[niche market]] for colored fleeces, mostly for [[handspinning]].<ref name="hobby"/>

Sheep have a rather wide range of height and weight, largely depending on breed. The rate of a sheep's growth and their eventual mature weight is a highly [[heritable]] trait that is often a point of focus for selective breeding.<ref name="storey"/> Ewes typically weigh between 100 and 225 pounds (45&ndash;100 kg), and rams (being generally larger than ewes) between 100 and 350 pounds (45&ndash;160 kg).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |author=Melinda J. Burrill Ph.D. Professor Coordinator of Graduate Studies, Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, California State Polytechnic University |title =Sheep |encyclopedia=World Book |publisher=Mackiev}}</ref> Mature sheep have 32 teeth ([[Dentition|dental formula]]: I:0/4  C:0/0  P:3/3  M:3/3).  There are six molars and six premolars, all paired in the upper and lower jaws, together forming broad grinding surfaces at the back of the mouth. As in other ruminants, the eight incisors are all in the lower jaw, biting against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw; together these are used to pick off vegetation. There are no canines, but there is a large gap where they would be between the incisors and the premolars.  Until the age of four (when all the adult teeth have erupted), it is possible to distinguish the age of sheep from their front teeth: a pair of incisors erupts each year. Though some sheep may live as long as 20 years, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to decline slowly from four years on, the loss of teeth making it progressively harder for them to feed and thus hindering the health and productivity of the animal.<ref>{{cite web | last =Schoenian | first =Susan | title =Sheep Basics | work =Sheep101.info | url =http://www.sheep101.info/sheepbasics.html | accessdate =2007-11-27 }}</ref> The average life expectancy of a sheep is consequently 10 to 12 years.<ref name="sheep and goat">{{cite book |title= Sheep and Goat Science, Fifth Edition|last=Ensminger |first=Dr. M.E. |coauthors= Dr. R.O.

Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled.<ref name="begin"/> Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, and possess a wide peripheral field of vision with some ability to distinguish color. With what is estimated to be approximately 270<U+00B0> to 320<U+00B0> of wide-angle vision, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads (though this ability may be impaired slightly by any wool present around the eyes).<ref name="ASI">{{cite journal |last=Shulaw |first=Dr. William P.|year=2006 |title=Sheep Care Guide |url=http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/text&nav_id=ae6dbb298c3d1de20836b1377e7933e9 |accessdate= 2007-11-27 }}</ref><ref name="hobby">{{cite book |title=Sheep: small-scale sheep keeping for pleasure and profit |last=Weaver |first=Sue |year=2005 |publisher=Hobby Farm Press, an imprint of BowTie Press, a division of BowTie Inc. |location=3 Burroughs Irvine, CA 92618 |isbn=1-931993-49-1 }}</ref> However, sheep have poor [[depth perception]]; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to balk.

Sheep and goats are closely related (both are in the subfamily [[Caprinae]]), and it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate them by appearance alone. However, the genes of sheep and goats differ so greatly that cross-species [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s rarely occur, and are always [[infertile]]. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a [[sheep-goat hybrid]], and is not to be confused with the [[Chimera (genetics)|genetic chimera]] called a [[geep]]. Visual clues to differentiating sheep and goats include the beard and divided upper lip of goats, which sheep do not have. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or [[Docking (animal)|docked]], while the tails of goats are held upwards.  Sheep breeds are also often naturally [[polled]] (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ especially in that buck goats acquire a unique and very strong odor during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]], whereas rams do not.<ref name="begin"/> [[Image:Merino New Zealand.jpg|thumb|250px|A New Zealand [[Merino]]]]

===Breeds===
{{seealso|List of sheep breeds}}
The domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]] now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes.<ref name="okstate>{{cite web |url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/ |title=Sheep (Ovis aries) |accessdate= 2007-11-02 |work=Breeds of Livestock |publisher=Oklahoma State University Dept. of Animal Science }}</ref><ref name="sheep and goat"/> Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but concrete documentation has not been produced for such a number.<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="begin"/> Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides or a combination thereof (i.e. dual-purpose breeds). Other distinctions made in classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), the presence or lack of horns, and the [[topography]] of a breed's origin. This last point is especially stressed in the United Kingdom, where breeds are described as either [[Upland (geology)|upland]] (a.k.a. hill or mountain) or [[lowland]] (a.k.a. down) breeds, each traditionally are said to bear characteristics imparted from their respective terrain.<ref name="modern">{{cite book |title=The Modern Shepherd |last=Brown |first=Dave |coauthors= Sam Meadowcroft |year=1996 |publisher=Farming Press |location=Wharfedale Road, Ipswich 1P1 4LG, United Kingdom |isbn=0-85236-188-2 }}</ref> Especially in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]], a sheep may be of a [[fat-tailed sheep|fat-tailed breed]], which is a type of meat or dual-purpose sheep with larger deposits of fat within its tail.

Ovine breeds are also grouped based on how well they are suited to producing a certain type of breeding stock. Generally, sheep are thought to be either "ewe breeds" or "ram breeds". Ewe breeds are those that have good reproductive and mothering capabilities, and are for replacing ewes in standing flocks. Ram breeds are selected for rate of weight gain and carcass quality, and are mated with ewe breeds to produce market lambs. Many breeds, especially rare or primitive ones, fall into neither category strictly. Lowland and upland breeds are also crossed in this fashion, with the hardy hill ewes crossed with larger, fast-growing lowland rams to produce a type of ewe called a [[Mule (sheep)|mule]], which can then be crossed with meat-type rams to produce prime market lambs.<ref name="modern"/>
[[Image:The three-horned one again.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Primitive Northern European breeds such as this [[Hebridean sheep|Hebridean]] ram have short tails, a wider variation in color, and often sport multiple horns.]]  
Sheep breeds are categorized by the type of wool they exhibit, irrespective of whether they are favored for meat or wool production. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, and are consequently preferred by the textile industry. Most of these breeds were derived from Merino sheep. Medium wool breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the [[Corriedale sheep|Corriedale]], are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with lengthy wool and a slow rate of maturation. Long wool sheep are most valued by modern agriculture for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]] breed was developed through crossing [[Lincoln sheep|Lincoln]] rams<U+2014>a long wool breed<U+2014>with fine-wooled [[Rambouillet (sheep)|Rambouillet]] ewes. 

Coarse or [[carpet]] wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show more variability in general traits than other types, the chief requirement being a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to reposition a few of the traditional breeds to alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.<ref name="living"/> 

A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep are similar to the very early type of domesticated sheep kept before wooly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the [[Dorper]], are the result of crosses between wooled and hair breeds. Resistant to parasites and needing no shearing, hair-class sheep are increasing in popularity among sheepmeat producers.<ref name="begin"/>

With the modern rise of corporate [[agrobusiness]] and the decline of localized [[family farm]]s, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction. The [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] of the U.K. lists 25 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals, and the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] lists 14 as being at less than 10,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rbst.org.uk/watch-list/sheep.php |title=Sheep |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=[[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]] (U.K.) |date=January 2007 |work=Rare Breeds Watchlist }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/wtchlist.html#sheep |title=Conservation Priority List |accessdate=2008-01-02 |author=[[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] |date=2007 }}</ref>   Preference for only those breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth rates has pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry.<ref name="living"/> Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.

Sheep are exclusively [[herbivorous]] mammals.  Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex [[digestive system]] composed of [[Ruminant|four stomachs]] that allows them to break down otherwise inedible roughage such as stems, leaves, and seed hulls in to complex [[carbohydrates]]. Sheep follow a [[diurnality|diurnal]] pattern of activity, beginning to feed at dawn and throughout the day until dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their [[cud]]. Ideal pasture for sheep is not [[lawn]]-like grass, but an array of [[grass]]es, [[legume]]s and [[forb]]s.<ref name="storey"/> Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) [[oak]] and [[acorns]], [[tomato]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[rhubarb]], [[potato]], and [[rhododendron]].<ref name="begin"/> Sheep also may perish from consuming man-made substances. 

Sheep are largely [[grazing]] herbivores, unlike [[browsing]] animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, they can crop plants very close to the ground and can [[overgraze]] a pasture much faster than cattle.<ref name="storey"/> For this reason, many shepherds utilize some type of managed grazing, whereby a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover.<ref name="begin"/><ref name="modern"/> Paradoxically, sheep can be both the cause of and solution to one of the major ill effects of overgrazing: the spread of [[invasive species|invasive plant species]]. By disturbing the natural make-up of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. But sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as [[cheatgrass]], [[leafy spurge]], [[kudzu]] and [[spotted knapweed]] over native species such as [[sagebrush]] &ndash; thereby making grazing sheep an effective measure in restoring native pastures.<ref name="storey"/>  

Other than forage, the only other common staple feed for sheep is [[hay]], most often during the winter months. The ability to survive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep are capable of doing so.<ref name="living"/> Also included in most sheep's diets are [[minerals]], either in a trace mix or in [[Salt lick|licks]]. 

Naturally, a constant source of [[potable]] water is also a fundamental requirement for sheep. The amount of water needed by sheep fluctuates with the season and the type and quality of the food they consume.<ref name="living"/> When sheep feed on large amounts of new growth and there is [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (including [[dew]], as sheep are dawn feeders), sheep need less water. When sheep are confined or are eating large amounts of cured [[hay]], more water is typically needed. Sheep also require clean water, and may refuse to drink water that is covered in [[Wiktionary:scum|scum]] or [[algae]].<ref name="living"/> 

Sheep are one of the few livestock animals raised for meat today that have never been widely kept in an [[Intensive farming|intensive]], [[confined animal feeding operation]].<ref name="hobby"/> Though there is a growing movement advocating extensive, [[free range]] farming, the vast majority of cattle, [[pig]]s, and [[poultry]] are still produced at factory farms.<ref name="storey"/> In contrast, only a few specific categories of sheep are regularly given high-concentration grain feed. Many sheep breeders choose to "[[Glossary of sheep husbandry|flush]]" ewes and rams during breeding, providing feed in key periods to increase fertility and birth weight. As 70% of a lamb's growth occurs in the last five to six weeks of gestation, ewes are also flushed during that period.<ref name="hobby"/> Other than flushing, only nursing ewes, lambs and especially old, infirm sheep are commonly provided with supplemental grain.<ref name="hobby"/> <ref name="living"/> Feed provided to sheep must be of a kind specially formulated for them, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain amounts of [[copper]] that are lethal to sheep.<ref name="hobby"/> The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as [[salt licks]]. When changing a sheep's content or time of feeding, changes are generally made gradually so as not to disrupt the function of the [[rumen]]; sudden changes in a sheep's diet can cause potentially fatal conditions such as [[bloat]].<ref name="storey"/>

==Behavior==
[[Image:ARS sheep herding.jpg|thumb|left|A flock being herded through a [[sagebrush]] [[steppe]]]]
Sheep are [[Predation|prey]] animals with a strong gregarious instinct, and a majority of sheep behavior can be defined in these terms.<ref name="storey"/> When sheep gather in larger social groups, it provides a mode of defense for a species without another means of doing so. All sheep exhibit some degree of natural [[Herd|flocking]] behavior, varying with breed. The [[dominance hierarchy]] of ''Ovis aries'' and its natural inclination to follow a leader in to new pastures were the pivotal factors in it being one of the first domesticated livestock species.<ref name="wild">{{cite book |title=The Covenant of the Wild: Why animals chose domestication |last=Budiansky |first=Stephen |year=1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300079931 |url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/YUPBOOKS/book.asp?isbn=9780300079937}}</ref> Farmers exploit these behaviors to keep sheep together on open pastures and to move them more easily. Shepherds may also use [[sheepdog]]s in this effort, whose inbred [[herding]] ability can assist in moving flocks. In regions such as [[Iceland]], where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior. Sheep without a flocking instinct tend to scatter rather than stay together when threatened, in a similar manner to goats. It is virtually impossible to use herding dogs with such breeds.<ref name="begin"/> Sheep can also become [[hefted]] to one particular pasture so they do not roam. This is in particular a characteristic of English upland breeds. Ewes teach this behavior to their lambs, and if flocks are culled entirely it must be retaught to them.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1634526.stm| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=[[2001-11-03]]| title=Sheep taught to stay put| accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref><ref name="storey"/>

Flock dynamics in sheep are as a rule only exhibited in a group of four or more sheep. Fewer sheep may not react as normally expected when alone or with very few other sheep. This is one reason why three is the minimum number of sheep in a [[sheepdog trial]]; it places the greatest pressure on a dog's herding abilities.<ref name="hobby"/> For sheep, the primary defense mechanism is simply to flee from danger when their [[flight zone]] is crossed. Secondarily, cornered sheep may attempt to leap at and ram threats in order to escape. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs and rams (hence the verb form of the word ram). In displaying flocking, sheep have a strong lead-follow tendency, and a leader often as not is simply the first sheep to move. However, sheep do establish a [[pecking order]] through physical displays of dominance. Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at [[wiktionary:trough|trough]]s. Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks same-breed subgroups tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within very large flocks.<ref name="hobby"/> [[Image:Lamb playfight.jpg|thumb|Lambs tussling during play. Lambs often imitate adult sheep behaviors, and establish their own rudimentary social hierarchies.]] 

Sheep are frequently thought of as extremely stupid animals.<ref name="begin"/><ref name="storey"/> A sheep's [[herd mentality]] and quickness to flee and panic in the face of stress often make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated. Despite these perceptions, a [[University of Illinois system|University of Illinois]] [[monograph]] on sheep found them to be just below pigs and on par with cattle in [[IQ]], and some sheep have shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]] found a way to get over [[cattle grid]]s by rolling on their backs.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3938591.stm| publisher=BBC News| date=[[2004-07-30]]| title=Crafty sheep conquer cattle grids| accessdate=2006-04-29}}</ref> If worked with patiently sheep may learn their names,  and many sheep are trained to be led by [[halter]] for showing and other purposes.<ref name="hobby"/> Very rarely, sheep are used as pack animals. [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.<ref name="hobby"/>

==Reproduction==
Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals. A flock of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a farmer or has established its dominance through physical contest with other rams (in [[feral]] populations).<ref name="living"/> Most sheep are seasonal breeders, though some are able to breed (also called tupping) year-round.<ref name="living"/> Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months).<ref name="living"/> Ewes enter in to [[estrus]] cycles about every 17 days, lasting for approximately 30 hours.<ref name="living"/> In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate their readiness through physical displays towards rams. Sheep may alternatively display a preference for [[homosexuality]], and the behavior occurs in about eight percent of rams on average.<ref name="nyt"/> Its occurrence does not seem to be related to dominance or flock hierarchy, rather the ram's typical motor pattern for intercourse is merely directed at rams instead of ewes.<ref name="nyt"/> Without human intervention, rams fight during the [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely.<ref name="living"/> During the rut, even normally friendly rams may become dangerous to humans due to increased hormone levels.<ref name="storey"/> Historically, especially aggressive rams were sometimes blindfolded or [[Hobble (device)|hobbled]] when interaction with people was necessary. Today, those who keep rams typically prefer softer preventative measures, such as moving within a clear line to an exit, never turning their back on a ram, and possibly using dousing with water or a diluted solution of bleach or vinegar to dissuade charges.<ref name="living"/> <ref name="hobby"/>
[[Image:Sheep with interesting horns.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A horned ram]]
Without [[ultrasound]] or other special tools, ascertaining whether sheep are in fact pregnant is initially difficult.<ref name="living"/><ref name="begin"/> Ewes only begin to visibly show a pregnancy about six weeks before the birth, so shepherds sometimes merely rely on the assumption that a ram has been given enough time to impregnate all the ewes.<ref name="living"/> However, a very commonly used piece of equipment for discerning which ewes have been mated with is a marking harness. By fitting a ram with a chest harness that holds a special [[crayon]], ewes that have been mounted are marked with its color. Dye may also simply be directly applied to the ram's [[brisket]]. After mating, sheep have a [[gestation]] period of around five months. Within a few days of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lay down and stand erractically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's [[udder]] will quickly fill out, and her [[vulva]] will swell. [[Vaginal]], [[Uterus|uterine]] or [[anal prolapse]] may also occur in problem cases, in which case either [[stitches|stitching]] or a physical retainer is used to hold the orifice in. When birth is imminent, [[contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s begin to take place, and the fitful behavior of the ewe may increase. A normal labor may take one to several hours: depending on how many lambs are present, the age of the ewe, and her physical and nutritional condition prior to the birth.<ref name="living"/> Though some breeds may regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce either single or twin lambs.<ref name="storey"/> At some point, usually either at the beginning of labor or just after the births have occurred, ewes and lambs are confined to small [[Glossary of sheep husbandry#Lambing jug|lambing jugs]]. These pens, which are generally two to eight feet in length and width, are designed to facilitate both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.<ref name="living"/> <ref name="modern"/> 
[[Image:Emerging lamb.jpg|thumb|250px|The second of twins being born on a New Zealand pasture]]
For shepherds, ovine [[obstetric]]s is sometimes a problematic phenomenon. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require any assistance, there are a large number of possible complications that may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the [[birth canal]]. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed; rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison).<ref name="begin"/>  Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding.<ref name="living"/> Lambs may also be [[aborted]] or [[stillborn]]. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing (who may or may not include a [[veterinarian]], most shepherds become accomplished at lambing to some degree) may assist the ewe in extracting or repositioning lambs.<ref name="living"/>  After the birth, ewes ideally break the [[amniotic sac]] (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. The licking both clears the nose and mouth, dries the lamb, and stimulates it.<ref name="living"/>  Lambs that are breathing and healthy at this point begin trying to stand, and ideally do so between an half and full hour, with help from the mother.<ref name="living"/>  Generally after lambs stand, the [[umbilical cord]] is trimmed to about an inch (2.54 centimeters). Once trimmed, a small container (such as a film canister) of [[iodine]] is held against the lamb's belly over the remainder of the cord to  prevent infection.<ref name="begin"/>

In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital [[colostrum]] milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are prevented from doing so by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied to force them to accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to [[force feeding|force feed]] the lamb in order to save its life.<ref name="living"/> In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, a shepherd may then attempt to graft an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes grafted after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event. Scent plays a large factor in ewes recognizing their lambs, so disrupting the scent of a newborn lamb with washing or over-handling may cause a ewe to reject theirs.<ref name="living"/><ref name="modern"/><ref name="storey"/> Conversely, various methods of imparting the scent of a ewe's own lamb to an orphaned one may be useful in grafting. If an orphaned lamb cannot be grafted, then it usually becomes what is known as a bottle lamb: a lamb raised by people and fed via bottle.<ref name="living"/>

After lambs are stabilized, [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|lamb marking]]&mdash;the process of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|ear tagging]], [[Docking (animal)|docking]], and [[castrating]]&mdash;is carried out.<ref name="living"/> Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are the primary mode of identification when sheep are not named; it is also the legal manner of animal identification in the [[European Union]]. When performed at an early age, ear tagging seems to cause little or no discomfort to lambs.<ref name="living"/> <ref name="storey"/>  However, using tags improperly or using tags not designed for sheep may cause discomfort, largely due to excess weight of tags for other animals.<ref name="living"/>  Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, though some shepherds choose to avoid the procedure for ethical, economic or practical reasons.<ref name="living"/> Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated.<ref name="modern"/> Docking, which is a shortening&mdash;not a complete removal&mdash;of sheep's tails is practiced for health reasons.<ref name="begin"/> The tail is removed just below the lamb's [[caudal]] tail flaps. Though docking is often considered cruel and unnatural by [[animal rights activist]]s, it is considered by sheep producers large and small alike to be a critical step in maintaining the health of sheep.<ref name="living"/><ref name="hobby"/><ref name="begin"/><ref name="modern"/>  Long, wooly tails make shearing more difficult, interfere with mating, and make sheep extremely susceptible to parasites, especially those that cause flystrike.<ref name="living"/> In Chuck Wooster's ''Living with Sheep'', the author anecdotally relates his shearer's response when told of his opposition to docking: "There's nothing natural about a sheep walking around with a dozen pounds of wool on it, and nothing natural about a sheep with a wooly tail [here referring to the hairless tails of wild and primitive sheep]. Natural's got nothing to do with it. Unless you want to watch your lambs walking around with tails covered by maggots and flies, cut the tails off."<ref name="living"/> Both castrating and docking can be performed with several different instruments. An [[elastrator]] places a tight band of rubber around an area, causing it to [[atrophy]] and fall off in a number of weeks. This process is bloodless and does not seem to cause extended suffering to lambs, who tend to ignore it after several hours.<ref name="living"/> <ref name="hobby"/> <ref name="modern"/> <ref name="storey"/> In addition to the elastrator, a [[Burdizzo]], [[emasculator]], heated [[chisel]] or [[knife]] are sometimes used.<ref name="living"/> After one to three days in the lambing jugs, ewes and lambs are usually sufficiently stabilized to allow reintroduction to the rest of the flock.<ref name="storey"/>

==Health==
Sheep may fall victim to chemical, [[pathogenic]] and physical means of sickness and injury. As a prey species, a sheep's system is designed to hide the obvious signs of illness as much as possible, in order to prevent being targeted by predators.<ref name="storey"/> However, there are some signs of  ill health that can be ascertained without any special testing. Sick sheep may be unwilling to eat, vocalize excessively, and be generally listless.<ref name="living">{{cite book |title=Living with Sheep: Everything You Need to Know to Raise Your Own Flock |last=Wooster |first=Chuck |coauthors=Geoff Hansen (Photography) |year=2005 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conneticut |isbn= 1-59228-531-7}}</ref> Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has gone in to dealing with sheep ailments in order to avoid the heavy losses sustained from them. Shepherds in history often created remedies through experimentation on the farm. In some countries, sheep do not have the economic impact to necessitate clinical studies designed to approve drugs specifically for usage with sheep. In such instance, many shepherds resort to extralabel usage of drugs approved for other animals.<ref name="storey"/> In the 21st century, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as [[homeopathy]], [[herbalism]] and even [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] to treat sheep veterinary problems. Though often met with skepticism, a few alternative treatments have been shown to be effective in trials for some specific problems.<ref name="storey"/><ref name="hobby"/> 
[[Image:Scrapie testing.jpg<U+200E>|220px|thumb|A veterinarian draws blood from a [[Suffolk sheep|Suffolk]] sheep in order to test for genetic resistance to scrapie]]
Many breeders take a variety of [[Preventative medicine|preventative measures]] to ward off problems before they arrive. The first is to ensure that all sheep purchased for the initial flock and replacement animals are healthy to begin with. Many buyers avoid outlets (such as sale barns) which are known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior.<ref name="storey"/> This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and [[quarantining]] new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventative programs are maintaining good nutrition and [[stress (medicine)|stress]]ing sheep as little as possible. Handling sheep in loud, erratic ways causes them to emit [[cortisol]], a [[stress hormone]]. Elevated amounts of cortisol can lead to a weakened [[immune system]], thus making sheep far more vulnerable to disease.<ref name="hobby"/> Signs of stress in sheep include: excessive [[panting]], [[teeth grinding]], restless movement, wool eating, and wood chewing.<ref name="hobby"/> Preventing the presence of harmful chemical agents is also an important part of a sheep owner's work. Common culprits of poisoning include [[pesticide]] sprays, inorganic [[fertilizer]], [[motor oil]], as well as radiator [[coolant]] (the [[ethylene glycol]] [[antifreeze]] in this is sweet-tasting).<ref name="storey"/> 

A common form of preventative medication for sheep are [[vaccination]]s and treatments for [[parasites]]. Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and their susceptibility to them is a primary impediment to certified [[Organic farming|organic]] sheep farming.<ref name="storey"/> Various [[worm]]s comprise most of the internal parasites, which are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral parasite medicines known as [[drench]]es are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after a count of eggs in the sheep's feces has been taken to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to prevent ingesting the same parasites.<ref name="modern"/>  External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep [[Hippoboscidae|ked]]s, [[nose bot]]s, sheep [[itch mite]], and [[maggots]]. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that can cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the [[bot fly]] and the [[blowfly]].  Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of [[flystrike]]. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool, and when the maggots hatch they burrow in to a sheep's living flesh, eventually resulting in death if unchecked. In addition to other treatments, [[crutching]] (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventative method. Nose bots are flies that inhabit a sheep's [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]]s, sprays or immersive treatments ([[sheep dip]]s).<ref name="storey"/>

A wide array of diseases caused by bacteria affect sheep, but a few are especially prevalent and some may even be transmittable to humans. Diseases of the hoof, such as [[foot rot]] and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and retard a sheep's ability to feed. Ovine [[Johne's Disease]] is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. [[Blue tongue disease]] is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the [[mucous membrane]]s. Soremouth (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or orf) is a skin disease leaving lesions that can be transmitted to persons handling infected flocks. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic [[abortion]] in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are [[scrapie]] and [[foot and mouth disease]], as both can decimate entire flocks. The latter poses a significant risk to humans. During the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease, hundreds of sheep in the U.K. were culled, and some rare British breeds were at risk for extinction from the pandemic.<ref name="storey"/> 

===Predation===
Other than parasites and disease, [[predation]] is a threat to sheep health and thereby the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have very little ability to defend themselves, even when compared with other prey species kept as livestock. Even if sheep are not directly bitten or survive an attack, they may die from panic or from injuries sustained.<ref name="storey"/> However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In [[Africa]], Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and [[Asia]] predators can be a serious problem. In contrast, some nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators. Many islands that are known for extensive sheep husbandry are suitable largely because of their predator-free status. Worldwide, [[canid]]s&mdash;including the domestic dog&mdash;are responsible for the majority of sheep deaths.<ref name="storey"/><ref name="hobby"/>

According to the [[National Agricultural Statistics Service]], 224,200 sheep were killed in the U.S. by predators in 2004, comprising approximately 37% of all ovine deaths for that year.<ref name="nass">{{Citation| publication-date =May 6, 2005 | title =Sheep and Goats Death Loss  | publisher =[[National Agricultural Statistics Service]] | url =http://usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/MannUsda/viewDocumentInfo.do?documentID=1628 | accessdate = 2007-12-27}}</ref> The sheep lost in that year represented a sum total of 18.3 million dollars for sheep producers.<ref name="nass"/> As all NASS statistics on sheep only take into account sheep after docking, the American Sheep Industry Association estimates that an additional 50-60,000 lambs were killed before docking occurred.<ref name="asia">{{Citation| publication-date =May 6, 2005 | title =Sheep and Predator Management -2005 | publisher =American Sheep Industry Association | url =http://www.sheepusa.org/index.phtml?page=site/text&nav_id=985657ba31b8c58581a120f26a0ca123 | accessdate = 2007-12-27}}</ref> [[Coyote]]s were responsible for 60.5% of all deaths, with the next largest being domestic dogs at 13.3%.<ref name="nass"/> Other North American predators of sheep included [[cougar]]s (5.7%), [[bobcat]]s (4.9%), [[eagle]]s (2.8%), [[bear]]s (3.8%), and [[fox]]es (1.9%).<ref name="nass"/> [[Wolves]], [[raven]]s, [[vulture]]s, and other animals together made up the remaining 7.1% of deaths.<ref name="nass"/>

In South America, the only widespread potential predators of sheep are cougars and [[jaguar]]s, both of which are known to prey on livestock regularly. South American canids such as the [[Maned wolf]] and foxes of the genus ''[[Pseudalopex]]'' are also blamed for sheep deaths, but no evidence for a statistically significant amount of predation by these species has ever been presented. Though large, the [[South African]] sheep industry is significantly hindered by the innumerable predators present in the country.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> Other African nations that rely on sheep face a similar problem.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> 
 
The main Australian predator of sheep is the [[dingo]], which is a large-enough danger to sheep to precipitate the construction of the world's largest fence: the [[Dingo Fence]]. In contrast, New Zealand has no large [[carnivore]]s whatsoever. The sole animal known to attack sheep in New Zealand is the rare, unusual [[kea]] parrot endemic to the country's [[South Island]]. The U.K. and Ireland once both had wolves and bears, but today only the [[Red fox]] and [[birds of prey]] remain a tangible threat to sheep in the British Isles.

Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to try and combat predation throughout history. Pre-modern shepherds had only the most basic of tools: their own presence and [[livestock guardian dog]]s. Whereas sheepdogs [[herd]] sheep, guardian dogs are trained to integrate in to flocks and protect them from predators. The ability of these dogs to do so is a transference of the canine [[Pack (canine)|pack]] social structure on to a flock. Following their invention, the focus in dealing with predators shifted to the nearly exclusive use of [[guns]], [[trap]]s, and [[poisons]] to kill predators both defensively and preemptively.<ref name="storey"/> The population of predator species plummeted worldwide, pushing some to [[extinction]] or significantly reducing their original ranges. With the appearance of the [[environmentalism|environmental]] and [[conservation movement]]s, and subsequent [[state]], [[provincial]], national and international legislation, simply exterminating predator species failed to be a viable option for protecting flocks.<ref name="storey"/> While killing predators caught directly in the act of attacking sheep may be legal, hunting predators is usually not. Poisons, such as [[compound 1080]] and [[sodium cyanide]], that were previously either placed in [[bait]] or in special sheep collars are now banned or restricted in most countries.<ref name="begin"/>

The 1970s saw an ensuing resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control, many of them non&ndash;lethal. [[Donkey]]s and [[Guard llama|llama]]s have been used since the 1980's in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs.<ref name="storey"/> Donkeys and llamas&mdash;which have a natural dislike of all canines&mdash;need no special training to deter predators.<ref name="living"/> However, intact males may kill ewes by attempting to breed them, and must be kept without others of their kind in order to bond with the sheep.<ref name="storey"/> Dogs, even those from specialized breeds, need some training to be effective and can be used in concert with other dogs. Dogs are the only guardian animal known to be effective with bears and cougars; donkeys and llamas are usually ineffective as they are themselves vulnerable to predation by bears and cougars.<ref name="hobby"/> However, dogs have been killed by wolves and may even attract wolf packs.<ref name="storey"/> Whatever species is used for guarding, individual animals may be temperamentally ill&ndash;suited to working with sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non&ndash;lethal predator deterrents such as motion&ndash;activated lights and noisy alarms. While these devices have been shown to be successful, predators can become habituated to them.<ref name="storey"/>

Initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins. [[Archaeological]] evidence from [[statuary]] found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for wooly sheep may have began circa [[6000 BC]], but the earliest [[woven]] wool garments have only been dated to two to three thousand years later.<ref name="begin"/> By that span of the [[Bronze Age]], sheep with all the major features of modern breeds were widespread throughout [[Western Asia]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/> However, one chief difference between ancient sheep and most modern breeds is the technique by which wool could be collected. Primitive sheep cannot be shorn, and must have their wool plucked out by hand in a process called "[[Glossary of sheep husbandry|rooing]]". This is due to the fact that their kemps (coarse, unworkable hairs) are still longer than the soft fleece. The fleece may also be collected from the field after it falls out. This trait survives today in unrefined breeds such as the [[Soay sheep|Soay]]. The Soay, along with other Northern European breeds with short tails, unshearable fleece, diminutive size, and horns in both sexes, are more closely related to ancient sheep than most breeds found today. Originally, weaving and spinning wool was a handicraft practiced at home, rather than an industry. [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Babylonians]], [[History of Sumer|Sumerians]], and [[Persians]] all depended on sheep; and though [[linen]] was the first fabric to be fashioned in to clothing, wool was a prized product. The raising of flocks for their fleece was one of the earliest industries, and flocks were a medium of exchange in [[Barter|barter economies]]. Numerous [[Biblical]] figures kept large flocks, and subjects of the king of Israel were taxed according to the number of rams they owned.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> 

===In Europe===
{{seealso|British Agricultural Revolution}}
[[Image:Suovetaurile Louvre.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1st Century CE relief of a bull, a sheep and a pig being led to sacrifice in Rome]]
From [[Southwest Asia]], sheep husbandry spread quickly in to [[Europe]]. Practically from its inception, [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek civilization]] relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals.<ref name="hobby"/> [[Scandanavian]] sheep of a type seen today<U+2014>with short tails and multi-colored fleece<U+2014>were also present early on. Later, the [[Roman Empire]] kept sheep on a wide scale, and the Romans were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising throughout the continent. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] (''Naturalis Historia''), speaks at length about sheep and wool.<ref name="pliny">{{Citation |author=[[Pliny the Elder]] | title= [[Naturalis Historia]] | date= AD 77 | pages=  Chapters 72-25 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23397;layout=;loc=8.73 | accessdate=2007-12-29 }}</ref> Declaring "Many thanks, too, do we owe to the sheep, both for appeasing the gods, and for giving us the use of its fleece.", he goes on to detail the breeds of ancient sheep and the many colors, lengths and qualities of wool.<ref name="pliny"/> Romans also pioneered the practice of blanketing sheep, in which a fitted coat (today usually of [[nylon]]) is placed over the sheep to improve the cleanliness and luster of its wool.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> 

During the Roman occupation of the British Isles, a large wool processing factory was established in [[Winchester, England]] circa [[50 AD]].<ref name="hobby"/> By [[1000 AD]], England and [[Spain]] were recognized as the epicenters of sheep production in the Western world, and the word "sheep" itself was first used in [[Middle English]], the language of the period.<ref name="mw">{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheep |title=Sheep |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}</ref> Etymologically the word is derived from the [[Old English]] term ''sc<U+0113>ap'', and it is akin to the [[Old High German]] ''sc<U+0101>f''.<ref name="mw"/> As the progenitors of the extremely fine-wooled Merino breeds, the Spanish gained great wealth; wool money largely financed Spanish rulers, and thus, the voyages to the New World.<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> The powerful ''[[Mesta]]s'' controlled sheep production, and flocks had a lawful [[:wiktionary:right of way|right of way]] for their migratory routes from [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalusia]] to [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]. Exportation of Merinos was a punishable offense that required royal permission, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of that country in the mid-18th century. After the breaking of the export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. For example, the export to [[Rambouillet]] by [[Louis XVI]] in 1786 formed the basis for the modern [[Rambouillet sheep|Rambouillet]] (or French Merino) breed.<ref name="storey"/> After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the [[Churro (sheep)|Churra]], and was no longer of international economic significance.
[[Image:Aberdeen ram.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a ram from the [[Aberdeen Bestiary]], a 12th century illuminated manuscript]] 
The sheep industry in Spain was an instance of completely open range flock management, with enormous flocks of only a few breeds ranging over the entire nation. However, the ovine model used in England was quite different, and had a similar importance to economy of the [[British Empire]]; to this day the [[Lord Speaker]] of the [[House of Lords]] sits on a bench known as the [[Woolsack]]. The high concentration and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the U.K. allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby giving rise to an exceptional variety of breeds in relation to the land mass of the country.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> This greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep. 

The growth of the sheep industry in Britain quickened in the 15th and 16th centuries  due to booming wool prices and the greater pasture available due to a diminished population (the result of the [[Black Death]]). More landholders were willing and able to turn their lands over to pasture for sheep, and an influx of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] immigrants skilled in cloth making and [[dyeing]] during the reign of [[Edward III]] helped to cement the wool trade. By this time, Britain  began moving from an [[open field system]] to one of [[enclosure]]. The unilateral closing of [[commons]] by landed gentry had enormously detrimental effects on local communities<U+2014>entire villages were sometimes depopulated to make way for pasture<U+2014>and was widely protested.<ref name="agrarian">{{cite book |title=The Agrarian History of England and Wales |last=Thirsk |first=Joan|coauthors= H.

An important event not only in the history of domestic sheep, but of all livestock, was the work of [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] in the 1700s. Before his time, breeding for desirable traits was often based on chance, with no scientific process for selection of breeding stock. Bakewell established the principles of [[selective breeding]]<U+2014>especially line breeding<U+2014>in his work with sheep, horses and cattle, and his theories were an influence on the subsequent work of [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Charles Darwin]].<ref name="hobby"/><ref name="storey"/> His most important contribution to sheep was the development of the Leicester Longwool, a quick-maturing breed of blocky conformation that formed the basis for many vital modern breeds.<ref name="storey"/> Today, the sheep industry in Spain and the U.K. does not play as large an international role, even if it is often of local economic and cultural importance; both countries are still large consumers of sheep meat.

===In the Americas===
{{seealso|Agricultural history of the United States}}
[[Image:Corriedale lambs in Tierra del Fuego.JPG|thumb|250px|Corriedale lambs on [[Tierra del Fuego]]]]
No ovine species native to the Americas has ever been domesticated, despite being closer genetically to domestic sheep than many Asian and European species, having the same number of chromosomes. The first domestic sheep<U+2014>most likely of the [[Churra]] breed<U+2014>arrived with [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|Christopher Columbus' second voyage]] in 1493.<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> The next [[Transatlantic]] shipment to arrive was with [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] in 1519, landing in [[Mexico]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/> Neither of these established a substantial population of sheep, and no export of wool or animals is known to have occurred. The next transport of sheep to North America was not until 1607 with the voyage of the ''HMS Susan Conant'' to [[Virginia]].<ref name="sheep and goat"/>  However, the sheep that arrived in that year were all consumed because of a [[famine]], and a permanent flock was not to reach the colony until two years later in 1609.<ref name="begin"/> Two decades later, the colonists had grown their flock to a total of 400. Sheep were also eventually purchased from the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonizers of [[Manhattan]]. In 1662, a woolen mill was built in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], and by the 1640s there were approximately 100,000 head of sheep in the 13 colonies.<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref name="hobby"/> Early on, the British government banned further export of sheep to the Americas, or wool from it, in an attempt to stifle any threat to the wool trade in the British Isles. One of many restrictive trade measures that precipitated the [[American Revolution]], the sheep industry in the Northeast grew despite the bans. 

Gradually throughout the 1900s, sheep production moved westward, and today the vast majority of flocks reside on Western range lands. During this westward migration of the industry, competition between sheep and cattle operations grew more heated, eventually erupting in to [[range wars]]. Other than simple competition for [[grazing rights|grazing]] and [[water rights]], cattlemen believed that the secretions of the foot glands of sheep made cattle unwilling to graze on  places where sheep had stepped.<ref name="begin"/> Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as [[Bighorn sheep]] (''O. canadesis''). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild ovines, and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep.<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Forstenzer

===In Australia and New Zealand===
{{mainarticle|Agriculture in Australia}} 
Australia and New Zealand are crucial players in the contemporary sheep industry, and sheep are an iconic part of both countries' culture and economy. New Zealand has the highest density of sheep per capita (sheep outnumber the human population 12<U+2013>1), and Australia is the world's indisputably largest exporter of sheep and cattle.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/Society/1/en| work=TeAra: the Encyclopedia of New Zealand| date=[[2006-06-09]]| title=The people of New Zealand |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>  Though sheep were present in these countries from the earliest stages of their colonization, the Merino breed<U+2014>the cornerstone of the Australian sheep industry<U+2014>was not introduced until 1789.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> While much of the growth in both nations was due to the active support of Britain, both worked to develop many unique new high-production breeds: the Corriedale, [[Coopworth]], [[Perendale]], [[Polwarth (sheep)|Polwarth]], [[Booroola Merino]], [[Peppin Merino]], and [[Poll Merino]] were created in New Zealand or Australia.<ref name="storey"/> Wool production was a fitting industry for colonies far from their home nations. Before the advent of fast air and maritime [[shipping]], wool was one of the few viable products that was not subject to [[spoiling]] on the long passage back to British ports. Flocks in Australia have always been largely range bands on fenced land, and are aimed at production of superfine wool for clothing and other products as well as meat. New Zealand flocks are kept in a fashion similar to English ones, in fenced holdings without herders. Though wool was once the primary income source for New Zealand sheep owners, today it has shifted to meat production.<ref name="sheep and goat"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/Economy/2/en |work=TeAra: the Encyclopedia of New Zealand| year=2007| title=Agricultural production |accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref>

Somewhat unusually for livestock, the Australian sheep industry is the only sector internationally to receive strident, widespread criticism for its practices. The custom of [[mulesing]], in which skin is cut away from an animal's [[Perineum|perineal]] area without [[anesthesia]] to prevent cases of flystrike, has been condemned widely as painful and unnecessary.<ref name="ng"> {{cite news |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0816_050816_woolboycott.html |title = Wool Boycott Targets Australia Sheep Farmers |date = [[2005-08-16]]  |accessdate = 2007-12-07 |publisher=[[National Geographic News]]}}</ref>  In response, a program of phasing out mulesing is currently being implemented.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australianwoolgrowers.com.au/news2004/news081104.html | title = In the News | date = [[2004-11-08]] | accessdate = 2007-01-09 | author = Peter Wilkinson | publisher = Australian Wool Growers Association }}</ref> Most of the sheep meat exported from Australia are either frozen carcasses to the U.K. or live animals to the [[Middle East]].

===Cultural significance===

Sheep have had a strong presence within many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock.  A wide symbology relates to sheep in art, religion and language. The raising of sheep for wool and meat became a major industry in the U.K. Australia and New Zealand and remains significant. As a result, sheep and sheep shearing have become an important part of the cultural traditions of these countries in particular. More ancient references to sheep usually revolve around their original region of domestication in Western Asia. 

Sheep have become an integral part of many linguistic traditions. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led, if not outright stupid.<ref name="mw"/> In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power, such as for the [[St. Louis Rams]] and the [[Dodge Ram]]. Sheep are key symbols in [[fable]]s and [[nursery rhymes]] like ''[[The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]]'', ''[[Little Bo Peep]]'', ''[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep (nursery rhyme)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', and ''[[Mary Had a Little Lamb]]''.  Novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'', [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' and [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' utilize sheep, as either characters or symbols. Poems like [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]", and songs such as [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Sheep (song)|Sheep]]" use sheep for [[metaphor]]ical purposes. In more modern popular culture, [[Exploding sheep]] are a video gaming phenomenon. The 2007 film ''[[Black Sheep (2007 film)|Black Sheep]]'' exploits sheep for horror and comedic effect, ironically turning sheep into blood-thirsty killers. The [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'', adapted from [[Dick King-Smith]]'s ''[[The Sheep Pig]]'', revolves around sheep husbandry and utilizes sheep as central characters.

[[Counting sheep]] is popularly  said to be an aid to sleep, and some [[Yan Tan Tethera|ancient systems of counting sheep]] persist today.  Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and [[idiom]] frequently with such phrases as "[[black sheep]]". Stereotypically, sheep are proverbial for their willingness to follow others of their kind. Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] of [[sheeple]]. Somewhat differently, the adjective "sheepish" is also used to describe embarrassment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sheepish |title=Sheepish |accessdate=2007-12-01 |work=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary }}</ref>

====In religion and folklore====
[[Image:Liten askenasisk sjofar 5380.jpg|thumb|left|A ram's horn shofar (photo by: Olve Utne)]]
Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first recorded faiths. In [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], the ram was the symbol of several gods: [[Khnum]] the [[Pottery|potter]] god who was the source of the [[Nile]], [[Heryshaf]] and [[Amun]] in his incarnation as a god of [[fertility]].<ref name="hobby"/> Other deities shown with ram features include: the goddess [[Ishtar]], the [[Phoenecian]] god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes.<ref name="hobby"/> There are also many ancient Greek references to sheep. The god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] was strongly associated with flocks and herds, and the legend of [[Chrysomallos]] the golden-fleeced ram continues to be told through the modern era, and is the central image of the chivalric [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]. 

Sheep play a major symbolic and historical part in all the Abrahamic faiths, since [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]], [[Moses]], and [[King David]] all worked as [[shepherd]]s. According to the Biblical story of the [[Binding of Isaac]], a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Issac after an angel stays Abraham's hand. [[Eid ul-Adha]] is a major annual festival in [[Islam]] in which a sheep is sacrificed in remembrance of this act. Greeks and Romans also sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and [[Judaism]] also once sacrificed sheep as part of the [[Korban|Temple ritual]]. Many ovine symbols<U+2014>such as the [[Passover]] lamb and the ceremonial blowing of a [[shofar]]<U+2014>still find a presence in modern Jewish traditions. In [[Christianity]],  a congregation is often referred to as a flock, and the [[Adoration of the shepherds]] is an important element in the Christian [[iconography]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]]. Christ is also portrayed as the [[Sacrificial lamb]] of God (''[[Agnus Dei]]'') and [[Easter]] celebrations in [[Greece]] and [[Romania]] traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb. 

The ram is the first sign of the Western astrological [[zodiac]], in which it is known as ''[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]''. The sheep also forms one of the animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the [[Chinese zodiac]], related to the [[Chinese calendar]]. Chinese tradition associates each animal with certain personality attributes, and [[Sheep (zodiac)|people born in the year of the sheep]] are said to be shy, mild-mannered, and artistic, among other traits.

Domestic sheep have been important to many economies, given that sheep provide a wide array of raw materials. Wool continues to be a vital [[textile]], although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for [[synthetic fabric]]s.<ref name="hobby"/> For many shepherds, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without [[farm subsidies]].<ref name="hobby"/> Wool has also been used as material in making alternative products such as [[building insulation]].<ref name="living"/> In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry.<ref name="living"/> <ref name="modern"/> 

Sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, [[footwear]], rugs, and other products. [[Byproduct]]s from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep [[tallow]] was once used in [[candle]]making, sheep bone and [[cartilage]] has been used to furnish carved items such as [[dice]] and [[buttons]] as well as rendered [[glue]] and [[gelatin]]. Sheep [[intestine]] can be formed into [[sausage casing]]s, and lamb intestine has especially been formed into surgical [[suture]]s, as well as strings for musical instruments and [[tennis racket]]s.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> Sheep droppings have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional [[Wood pulp|pulp]] materials to make paper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sheeppoopaper.com/how_made.asp |title=Sheeppoopaper.com |accessdate=2007-12-01 }}</ref> Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is [[lanolin]]: the water-proof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable [[cosmetics]] and other products.<ref name="sheep and goat"/> 

In the modern era, sheep retain considerable importance in the economies of several countries.  After [[China]], the largest producers of sheep products are in the southern hemisphere: [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Patagonia]]n regions of [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Chile]]. Sheep play a major role in the economies of several smaller countries where the number of sheep may not be great and impact on the [[global economy]] is negligible, but is still important locally. For example, sheep production in the [[Faroe Islands]] is of key importance to the local history and economy, but has no perceptible impact on the global sheep meat or wool trade.

===As food===
{{mainarticle|Lamb and mutton}}
Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] to agriculture.<ref name="storey"/>  Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb.  "Mutton" is derived from the [[Old French]] "''moton''", which was the word for sheep used by the [[Normans|Anglo-Norman]] rulers of much of the British Isles in the [[Middle Ages]].  This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''sceap'' was kept for the live animal (eventually forming the word English speakers use today).<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 1933: Mutton, Sheep, Beef.</ref>  More recently, "mutton" has been limited to the meat of older sheep; "lamb" is used for that of younger ones, usually those under a year old. 
[[Image:Lamb shank.jpg|thumb|left|Lamb shanks]]
In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the [[Persian Gulf]] states, New Zealand, Australia, [[Greece]], [[Uruguay]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name ="hobby"/> These countries eat between 14 and 39 lbs. (approximately 3 to 18 kg) of sheep meat [[per capita]], [[per annum]]. By comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5 kg). In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may even restrict their habits to the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly the [[lamb chops|chop]] and the [[leg of lamb|leg]].<ref name ="hobby"/> In those that do favor sheep meat, it is often the product of a past history of sheep production, even if they produce little or no sheep today. In such countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and [[offal]] may be popular or traditional. Sheep [[testicles]]<U+2014>called [[animelles]] or [[lamb fries]] in culinary terminology<U+2014>are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. Perhaps the most [[Infamy|infamous]] dish of sheep meat is the Scottish [[haggis]], composed of a sheep's [[heart]], [[liver]] and [[lungs]] cooked within its stomach.<ref name="storey"/><ref name="begin"/>

Though it may have been in antiquity, sheep's milk is no longer drunk directly on any appreciable level. Sheep's milk is, however, valuable in the creation of some popular varieties of [[cheese]] and [[yogurt]]s. Containing 6% [[fat]] and double the [[Milk solids|solids]] of cow's milk, it can be crafted in to such dairy products with relative ease. Well-known [[:Category:Sheep's-milk cheeses|sheep milk cheeses]] include the [[Roquefort (cheese)|Roquefort]] of France, the [[Brocciu]] of [[Corsica]], [[Manchego]] from Spain, the [[Pecorino Romano cheese|Pecorino Romano]] of [[Italy]] and [[feta (cheese)|Feta]] of [[Greece]]. Sheep milk does contain 4.8% [[lactose]], which may affect those who are [[lactose intolerance|intolerant]].<ref name="hobby"/>

===In science===
Though not common model organisms, sheep have had played a small, yet influential role in scientific experimentation. Several of the few contemporary instances of sheep experimentation has caused a significant impact on science and culture at large. In 1996, a [[Finnish Dorset]] sheep named [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]] was the first mammal ever to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]]. Beginning in 2006, controversy raged over a scientific study at the [[Oregon Health and Science University]], which investigated the biological mechanisms producing homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA actively campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news |first=John |last=Schwartz |title=Of Gay Sheep, Modern Science and Bad Publicity |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/science/25sheep.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=[[2007-01-25]] |accessdate=2007-12-07 }}</ref>
