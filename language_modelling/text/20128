}}</ref> This is the lineup from the band's peak, responsible for most of its recorded output, and the lineup named by the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The group disbanded in early 1986, owing to lack of creative control and the loss of Headon in 1982 and Jones in 1983 due to internal friction. Strummer later apologised for their firing, admitting that it was a huge loss to the band.

The Clash were a major success in the UK from the release of their debut album. Their third album, ''[[London Calling]]'', released in the UK in December 1979, brought them popularity in the United States when it came out there the following year. It received wide critical acclaim; a decade later ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine declared it the best album of the 1980s.<ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies">{{cite web

The Clash agreed to a diminished royalty rate so that the triple album could be affordably retailed. Despite the enormous body of material, song quality remained high throughout Sandinista!, which included the Clash classics <U+201C>The Magnificent Seven<U+201D> The Call Up,<U+201D> <U+201C>Police on My Back,<U+201D> and <U+201D>Washington Bullets.<U+201D> London Calling and Sandinista! both fared well in America, charting at #27 and #24, respectively - impressive showings for a double and triple album. <br /> d) The three founding members - Strummer, Jones and Simonon - cooperated in the compiling of a live album (From Here to Eternity) and video documentary (Westway to the World), released in 1999. If not exactly a reunion, it was a rapprochement. On November 15, 2002, Jones and Strummer shared the stage for the first time in nearly 20 years, performing three Clash songs during the encore of a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. This raised hopes for a Clash reunion, which were dashed when Strummer died of a heart attack on [[December 22]], [[2002]].

==History==
===Formation and first years: 1975<U+2013>1976===
Most of the band's founding members were already active in the local music at the time of The Clash's formation. John Graham Mellor a/k/a [[Joe Strummer]] had previously played in the [[Pub rock (UK)|pub rock]] act [[The 101ers|The 101'ers]] (his stage name at this point was Woody Mellor; soon he renamed himself "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a busker in the [[London Underground]]). Mick Jones and Paul Simonon were briefly in legendary proto-punk band [[London SS]].

The Pistols were doing their occasional shows, but punk was something that really came about after the Grundy thing. Then it was called <U+2018>punk<U+2019> y<U+2019>know. So after probably about a year in rehearsals with just me and Mick and whoever we could find really to play the drums, and we had Keith Levene with us, we were just trying to build the group up and the Pistols were just starting to do their shows at that time, and it was only that later when we saw Strummer in the 101<U+2019>ers that we thought, <U+2018>we<U+2019>ll nick him for our group<U+2019>. An we did and that was the start of The Clash, really. Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together.

In [[January]] 1977 the group signed 100,000 pound contract with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]].<ref>Zaccuri 2003, p. 17.</ref>  The band recalled Terry Chimes for the recording, and hired Mickey Foote, who worked as a technician at their concerts, to produce the album.  They released their first single "[[White Riot]]", in [[March]] of 1977, and the their first album ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'', in [[April]] of 1977.  Both obtained considerable success in the UK, yet CBS refused to released the album and single in the [[United States|USA]], saying that the sound was not <U+201C>radio friendly<U+201D>.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World"/>  They eventually released there in a modified version in 1979, after the UK original became the best-selling import album of all time in the United States.<ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" />  At the time Chimes had left the band, so only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as "[[Tory]] Crimes".  In the documentary ''[[Westway to the World]]'', Mick Jones referred to him as one of "the best drummers around".<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" />  But Chimes, who had no great wish to make a career from music, said, "The point was that I wanted one kind of life <U+2013> they wanted another, and why are we working together, if we want completely different things?"

The band experienced a period of changing drummers.<ref name="NME-03_16_91" />  After some time with Mick Jones handling drum duties, the band finally recruited [[Topper Headon]], nicknamed "Topper" by Simonon, because he resembled the [[Topper (comic book)|famous comic]]'s cartoon cover star, "Mickey the Monkey".  Headon had excellent musical skills, being able to play other instruments such as piano, bass and guitar.  He was originally planning to stay briefly and gain a name for himself, before finding a better band. Realizing the band's potential he changed his plans and stayed in the band. In ''Westway To The World'' Strummer noted, "If we hadn't found Topper, I don't think we'd have got anywhere".<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" />

Before the band began recording their second album, CBS requested that the band adopt a cleaner sound in order to reach American audiences. [[Sandy Pearlman]], known for his work with [[Blue <U+00D6>yster Cult]], was hired to produce the record. Although some complained about the cleaner sound, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' received glowing reviews upon it's release.<ref name="RS-geer">{{cite web

===''London Calling'', ''Sandinista!'' and ''Combat Rock'': 1979-1981===
The Clash then recorded ''[[London Calling]]''.  Produced by [[Guy Stevens]], who had previously worked with [[Mott the Hoople]] and others, the [[double album]] was a mix of punk rock, rockabilly, reggae, rock and roll, ska and other elements<ref>{{cite web

The Clash planned to record and release a single every month in 1980. Their record label, CBS, balked at this idea, and these efforts resulted in the album ''[[Sandinista!]]''.

The band recorded their fifth album ''[[Combat Rock]]'', which was originally planned as a double album with the title ''[[Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg]]'', but the idea was scrapped after wrangling within the group.  Mick Jones had produced the first cut, but the other members were dissatisfied and producing duties were handed to [[Glyn Johns]] at which point the album became a single LP.  The original cut has since been bootlegged.  Simpler and more straightforward than ''[[Sandinista!]]'', the album contained the single "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]" which received heavy airplay in the US on AOR FM stations.  The following single, "[[Rock the Casbah]]", a song about the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music, was a Top 40 hit in the US, with heavy rotation on MTV.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" />

===Disintegration: 1982-1984===
After ''Combat Rock'', the Clash began to disintegrate. Topper Headon was asked to leave the band just prior to the release of the album, due to his [[heroin]] addiction, which was hurting his health and drumming.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" /><ref name="Cromelin-latime88">{{cite journal

}}</ref>  The band's original drummer, Terry Chimes, was brought back for the next few months.<ref name="trackMARX-Joe_Strummer" />  The loss of Headon brought much friction, as he was an essential part of the band and well-liked by the others. Jones and Strummer began to feud. The band opened for [[The Who]]  on a leg of their final tour in the U.S, playing New York's Shea Stadium.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" /> Though the band continued to tour, relationships within the band continued to fracture.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" /> 

The band continued to tour, but by 1983, the years of constant touring and recording took their toll.  They were growing as musicians and individuals, but they were not able to cope with the tension and stress.  Chimes left the band after the 1982-1983 ''Combat Rock'' tour, due to the in-fighting and turmoil. 

In 1983, drummer Pete Howard joined the band for the [[US Festival]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], of which The Clash were, along with [[David Bowie]] and [[Van Halen]], co-headliners. The crowd of roughly half a million was by far the biggest of the Clash's career.  This was Jones' last appearance with The Clash.  In September 1983, Jones was fired due to his problematic behaviour and divergent musical aspirations.<ref name="trackMARX-Joe_Strummer" /> Jones went on to found [[Big Audio Dynamite]] (BAD) with [[Don Letts]]. Strummer later tried to contact Jones to reform The Clash, but Jones was too busy with Big Audio Dynamite.<ref name="joestrummer.us">{{cite web

 | quote = a, b, c) After the disbandment, Strummer followed Mick Jones on holiday to ask him to reform the Clash. "I was trying to undo my mistake. But Big Audio Dynamite was taking off, so he just laughed at me." Nevertheless, Strummer and Jones did start to collaborate again, firstly on songs for Alex Cox's Sid Vicious biopic Sid and Nancy, then on material on the second BAD album, which Strummer co-produced. <br /> d, e) Finally, Strummer washed his hands of the album, Rhodes and the Clash. "CBS had paid an advance for it so they had to put it out. I just went, 'Well fuck this', and fucked off to the mountains of Spain to sit and sobbing under a palm tree, while Bernie had to deliver a record." ''Cut the Crap'' was issued in November 1985. Its music was as crass as it's cringe-making title - a bizarre cross between an attempt to get back to the Clash's punk roots and an assimilation of more contemporary trends, with its amateurish horn and synth overdubs, shot through with cartoonish (and somewhat Americanised) punk imagery and Sham 69-style terrace chanting.

The band picked [[Nick Sheppard]], formerly of the [[Bristol]]-based [[The Cortinas (punk band)|Cortinas]], and [[Vince White]] as the band's new guitarists.  Howard continued to be the drummer. The band played its first shows in January 1984 with a batch of new material and launched into a self-financed tour, dubbed the ''Out of Control'' tour, and they toured heavily over the winter and into early summer.  At a striking miners' benefit show ("Scargill's Christmas Party") in December 1984, they announced that a new record would be released early in the new year.

===''Cut the Crap'' and posthumous recognition: 1985-1998===
The recording sessions for ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' were chaotic, with manager Bernie Rhodes and Strummer working in [[Munich, Germany]]. Most of the instruments were played by studio musicians, with Sheppard and later White flying in to come up with guitar parts. Struggling with Rhodes for control of the band, Strummer returned home. The band went on a [[busking]] tour, playing in public spaces in cities throughout the UK where they played acoustic versions of their hits and popular cover tunes.

After a gig in Athens, Strummer went to Spain to clear his mind. While Strummer was gone, the first single from ''Cut the Crap'', "This Is England" was released to mostly negative reviews at the time.<ref name="joestrummer.us" />  However, respected critic [[Dave Marsh]] later championed "This Is England" as one of the top 1001 rock singles of all time, in his book "The Heart of Rock & Soul",<ref>{{cite book

I just went, 'Well fuck this', and fucked off to the mountains of Spain to sit sobbing under a palm tree, while Bernie had to deliver a record", said [[Joe Strummer]] later in an interview <ref name="joestrummer.us" />.

"[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]", much like the rest of the album that came out later that year, had been drastically re-engineered by Rhodes, with synths, drum machines, and football-style chants being added to Strummer's incomplete recordings.  For the remainder of his life Strummer publicly disowned the album,<ref name="Cromelin-latime88" /> although he did express the sentiment that "This Is England" was the last good Clash single.  Other songs played on the tour remain unreleased to this day, including "Jericho" and "Glue Zombie," while a live version of "(In the) Pouring Rain" finally saw release in 2007 on the soundtrack to ''[[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten]]'', a documentary about Joe Strummer.  Although Howard was an adept drummer, virtually all of the percussion tracks were produced by drum machines.  The Clash were effectively disbanded in early 1986, and the members went on to other projects.<ref name="Aversion-AH-The_Clash" />

On [[2 March]], [[1991]], The Clash scored their first #1 UK single with the reissue of <U+201C>Should I Stay or Should I Go<U+201D>. Joe Strummer reportedly cried and was very distraught when the band's hit and its title "Rock the Casbah" were used while [[Gulf War|bombing Iraq]] the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/strummer.html|title=Revolution rock: Documentary pays tribute to Clash frontman Joe Strummer|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-04-13}}</ref>

===Late reunions: 1999-present ===
In 1999, Strummer, Jones and Simonon cooperated in the compiling of the live album ''[[From Here to Eternity: Live|From Here to Eternity]]'' and video documentary ''[[Westway to the World]]''.  On [[15 November]], [[2002]], Jones and Strummer shared the stage, performing three Clash songs during a London benefit show by [[The Mescaleros|Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros]].<ref name="rockhall-The_Clash" />  In January 2003 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name="rockhall-The_Clash" /> The band wanted to play, but the death of Strummer in December 2002 prevented the potential reunion. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked The Clash<ref name="rollingstone.com-30_the_clash" /> #30 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.<ref name="rollingstone.com-the_immortals_the_first_fifty" />

In 2007, the late Joe Strummer was featured in a documentary directed by [[Julien Temple]], called ''[[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten]]''. It comprises archive footage of him spanning his life, and interviews with friends, family, and other celebrities along with extensive interviews by Jones, Headon, Simonon and Terry Chimes.

They were never driven entirely by [[money]]; even at their peak, tickets to shows and souvenirs were reasonably priced.<ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" />  The group insisted that CBS sell their double and triple album sets ''London Calling'' and ''Sandinista!'' for the price of a single album each (then <U+00A3>5), succeeding with the former and compromising with the latter by agreeing to sell it for <U+00A3>5.99 and forfeit all their [[royalties]] on its first 200,000 sales.<ref name="Westway_to_the_World" /><ref name="NME-03_16_91" />  These "VFM" (Value For Money) principles meant that they were constantly in [[debt]] to CBS, and only started to break even around 1982.<ref name="bbcco-Strummer_dies" />

Like many early punk bands, The Clash protested against [[monarchy]] and [[aristocracy]].  However, unlike many early punk bands, The Clash rejected the overall sentiment of [[nihilism]].<ref name="RS198004-The_Clash" />  Instead, they found solidarity with a number of contemporary liberation movements.  The Clash's political views, especially those of [[Joe Strummer]], were very leftist.  Their politics were expressed explicitly in their lyrics, in early recordings such as "White Riot", which encouraged disaffected white youths to become politically active like their black counterparts, "[[Career Opportunities]]", which expressed discontent about the alienation of low-paid, production line style employment and the lack of alternatives, and "London's Burning", about the bleakness and boredom of life in the inner city.<ref name="Aversion-AH-The_Clash" />

The group also supported other musicians' charity concerts, most notably at the December 1979 ''[[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea]]'', presented by [[Paul McCartney]].  [[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea (album and EP)|The benefit album]] and [[Concert for Kampuchea|film]], both released from the concerts, feature one song by The Clash, "Armagideon Time".  The Clash offered some support to the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] and other [[Marxism|Marxist]] movements in [[Latin America]] (hence the title of their 1980 album, ''[[Sandinista!]]'').  By the time of the December 1979 album ''[[London Calling]]'', the Clash were trying to maintain punk energy while developing musically.  They were especially wary of their own emerging stardom: they always welcomed fans backstage after shows and showed open-mindedness, genuine interest and compassion in their relationships with them. 

The title of ''London Calling'' evokes American radio newsman [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s catchphrase during [[World War II]], and the title song announces that <U+201C>''...war is declared and battle come down...''<U+201D>  It warns against expecting them to be saviours <U+2014>  <U+201C>''... now don't look to us'' / ''Phoney [[Beatlemania]] has bitten the dust...''<U+201D> <U+2014> draws a bleak picture of the times <U+2014> <U+201C>''The [[ice age]] is coming, the [[sun|sun's]] zooming in'' / ''Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin''<U+201D> <U+2014> but calls on their listeners to come out and take up the fight without constantly looking to London, or to The Clash themselves, for cues <U+2014> <U+201C>''Forget it, brother, we can go it alone... Quit holding out and draw another breath...

Strummer acted in a few movies, notably [[Alex Cox]]'s ''Walker,'' and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'', as well as a cameo in [[Aki Kaurism<U+00E4>ki]]'s ''I hired a Contract Killer'', in which he sings "Burning Lights/Afro-Cuban Be-Bop". He did songs for movie [[soundtrack]]s (notably "Love Kills" for the film ''[[Sid and Nancy]]''), and he co-produced the  ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' soundtracks with [[John Cusack]].  As well, he experimented with different backing bands with limited success. In 1989, he released the first of his solo albums, ''[[Earthquake Weather (album)|Earthquake Weather]]'', which was neither a commercial nor critical success. He toured with a new backing band, [[The Latino Rockabilly War]], which contributed five songs to the soundtrack of the movie [[Permanent Record]], including an instrumental and the song "Trash City", which was also released as a single. In 1991/92 Strummer joined [[The Pogues]] after their split with former frontman [[Shane MacGowan]] for a series of concerts across Europe. In the late 1990s, Strummer formed a backing band he called [[The Mescaleros]]. In [[1996]] Strummer recorded with Black Grape (band of vocalist Shaun Ryder, ex Happy Mondays) their football anthem "England's Irie", which became a Top Ten hit.  In [[2002]] Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros performed a benefit gig for the striking Firefighters of London (FBU) at the Acton Town Hall, London (later referred to as "The Last Night London Burned").  For the encores, Mick Jones joined the band.  They were: "Bankrobber", "White Riot" and "London<U+2019>s Burning".  His final gig was at Liverpool Academy on [[November 22|22 November]] [[2002]]. 

On [[December 22|22 December]] 2002 Joe Strummer died suddenly of a congenital heart defect at the age of 50.  The Mescaleros<U+2019> album he was working on at the time, ''[[Streetcore]]'', was released posthumously to critical acclaim in [[2003]].  Jones commented in the press that, after the brief reunion on ''Westway to the World'' in [[1999]], the foursome were considering reuniting for a tour.  

In [[2007 in film|2007]], a film has been made about Strummer's life, called ''[[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten]]''.  The  [[documentary film]], directed by [[Julien Temple]], premiered [[January 20]], [[2007]] at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name="imdb-Future_Is_Unwritten">{{cite web

<big>'''Mick Jones'''</big>
{{main|Mick Jones (The Clash)|Big Audio Dynamite|Carbon/Silicon}}
After his expulsion from The Clash, '''Mick Jones''' formed [[Big Audio Dynamite]] (often shortened to B.A.D.) in 1984 with film director Don Letts who directed various Clash videos and ''[[Westway to the World]]''. 

The band's debut album, ''[[This is Big Audio Dynamite]]'', was released the following year with the song "[[E=MC<U+00B2> (song)|E=MC<U+00B2>]]" receiving heavy rotation in dance clubs. The next album, ''[[No. 10 Upping St.]]'', reunited Jones with Strummer. Jones released three more albums with Big Audio Dynamite before reshuffling the line-up and renaming the band Big Audio Dynamite II. The band was later renamed Big Audio in the mid-1990s because they found that it was much more suitable for the type of genre they were influenced by at that particular time. 

Jones featured on the two studio albums by [[The Libertines]] as producer and also produced the debut [[Babyshambles]] album. Jones is currently touring and recording with his new band, [[Carbon/Silicon]].

<big>'''Paul Simonon'''</big>
[[Image:Paul Simonon mg 6692.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Paul Simonon]] at the [[Eurock<U+00E9>ennes]] 2007]] 
{{main|Paul Simonon|Havana 3am|The Good, the Bad and the Queen}}
Following the break-up of The Clash, Paul Simonon formed a group called [[Havana 3am]], which recorded only one album in Japan and quickly folded. Then Simonon returned to his roots as a visual artist, mounting several art-gallery shows and contributing the cover for Jones' third BAD album, ''Tighten Up Vol. 88''. 

Simonon's reluctance to play music again has largely been cited as the reason why The Clash were one of the few 1970s British punk bands that did not reform to cash in on the punk-nostalgia craze of the late 1990s. Simonon was quoted in ''Westway to the World'' as saying that The Clash are over and that "suits him fine". 

He is currently collaborating with [[Damon Albarn]], of [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Simon Tong]] of [[The Verve]], and [[Tony Allen]], main founder of the [[afrobeat]] and drummer of [[Fela Kuti]] to form [[The Good, the Bad and the Queen]]. Their first gig took place on the [[26 October]] [[2006]] at the [[Roundhouse]]. 

After a seven year gap Simonon is exhibiting paintings again.  He will be having a show at Thomas Williams Fine Art on Bond St from the 17th April 2008. 

<big>'''Topper Headon'''</big>
{{main|Topper Headon}}
By 1982, '''Topper Headon''' had been dismissed by the rest of the band due to the heroin addiction. His addiction eventually landed him in jail for supplying an addict who later overdosed and died. Except for forming a short-lived [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] band (in 1986 he recorded a LP called ''[[Waking Up (Topper Headon album)|Waking Up]]'' as well as a 12" E.P. titled ''Drumming Man''), Headon disappeared from the music business until the filming of Letts' retrospective [[Documentary film|documentary]] about The Clash, ''[[Westway to The World]]'', where he sincerely apologised for his addiction. Headon also attended a subsequent presentation to Strummer, Jones, Simonon, and Headon of a Lifetime Achievement British Music Award. After many years of rehabilitation, he has overcome his addiction, and is performing live again. 

On [[January 11]], 2008, Headon shared the stage with [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] during a [[Carbon/Silicon]] gig at the Carbon Casino Club, The Inn on the Green, 3-5 Thorpe Close, [[Portobello]] Green, [[London]].  Headon played together with Jones and Carbon/Silicon two Clash's song, "[[Train in Vain|Train in Vain (Stand by Me)]]" and "[[Should I Stay or Should I Go]]".  This performance marked the first time since 1982 that Headon and Jones had performed together on stage.<ref>{{cite web
