'''Ununoctium''' is the temporary [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] [[systematic element name|name]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Atomic weights of the elements 2005 (IUPAC Technical Report)|journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|issue=11|pages=2051<U+2013>2066| doi=10.1351/pac200678112051| author=Wieser, M.E.}}</ref> for the [[transactinide element]] having the [[atomic number]] 118 and temporary [[chemical symbol|element symbol]] '''Uuo'''. It is also known as '''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka-radon]]''' or '''element 118''', and on the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements it is a [[p-block]] element and the last one of the [[period 7|7th period]]. Ununoctium is currently the only [[synthetic element|synthetic]] member of [[Group 18 element|group&nbsp;18]]. It has the highest atomic number and highest [[atomic mass]] of all the elements discovered so far.

The [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] ununoctium atom is very unstable, due to its high mass, and since 2005, only three or possibly four atoms of the [[isotopes of ununoctium|isotope <sup>294</sup>Uuo]] have been detected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/physics/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C=|title=The Top 6 Physics Stories of 2006|accessdate=2008-01-18|date=2007-01-07|publisher=Discover Magazine}}</ref> While this allowed for very little experimental characterization of its properties and possible [[Chemical compound|compounds]], theoretical calculations have resulted in many predictions, including some unexpected ones. For example, although ununoctium is a member of Group&nbsp;18, it may possibly not be a [[noble gas]], unlike all the other Group&nbsp;18 elements.<ref name=Nash/> It was formerly thought to be a gas but is now predicted to be a [[solid]] under [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]] due to [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]].<ref name=Nash/>

===Unsuccessful synthesis attempts===
In late 1998, Polish physicist [[Robert Smola<U+0144>czuk]] published calculations on the fusion of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of [[superheavy element|superheavy atoms]], including ununoctium.<ref name=Smolanczuk>{{cite journal|author=Smolanczuk, R.|journal=[[Physical Review]] C|volume=59|issue=5|year=1999|title=Production mechanism of superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions|pages=2634<U+2013>2639|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.59.2634|bibcode = 1999PhRvC..59.2634S}}</ref> His calculations suggested that it might be possible to make ununoctium by fusing [[lead]] with [[krypton]] under carefully controlled conditions.<ref name=Smolanczuk/>

In 1999, researchers at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] made use of these predictions and announced the discovery of [[livermorium]] and ununoctium, in a paper published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ninov|first=Viktor|coauthors=|displayauthors=1|title=Observation of Superheavy Nuclei Produced in the Reaction of {{SimpleNuclide|Link|Krypton|86}} with {{SimpleNuclide|Link|Lead|208}}|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=83|pages=1104<U+2013>1107|year=1999|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.1104|bibcode=1999PhRvL..83.1104N|issue=6}}</ref> and very soon after the results were reported in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Service, R.

In 2011, [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] evaluated the 2006 results of the Dubna-Livermore collaboration and concluded: "The three events reported for the Z = 118 isotope have very good internal
redundancy but with no anchor to known nuclei do not satisfy the criteria for discovery".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-10-05-01|title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report)|year=2011|last1=Barber|first1=Robert C.|last2=Karol|first2=Paul J.|last3=Nakahara|first3=Hiromichi|last4=Vardaci|first4=Emanuele|last5=Vogt|first5=Erich W.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|page=1|volume=83|issue=7}}</ref>

In the experiments, the alpha-decay of three atoms of ununoctium was observed. A fourth decay by direct [[spontaneous fission]] was also proposed. A [[half-life]] of 0.89&nbsp;ms was calculated: <sup>294</sup>Uuo decays into [[livermorium-290|<sup>290</sup>Lv]] by [[alpha decay]].

Before the retraction in 2002, the researchers from Berkeley had intended to name the element ''ghiorsium'' (Gh), after [[Albert Ghiorso]] (a leading member of the research team).<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of New Elements Makes Front Page News|url=http://lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Research-Review/Magazine/1999/departments/breaking_news.shtml|publisher=Berkeley Lab Research Review Summer 1999|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref>

The Russian discoverers reported their synthesis in 2006. In 2007, the head of the Russian institute stated the team were considering two names for the new element: ''flyorium'', in honor of [[Georgy Flyorov]], the founder of the research laboratory in Dubna; and ''moskovium'', in recognition of the [[Moscow Oblast]] where Dubna is located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.rin.ru/eng/news/9886/9/6/|title=New chemical elements discovered in Russia`s Science City|date=2007-02-12|accessdate=2008-02-09}}</ref> He also stated that although the element was discovered as an American collaboration, who provided the californium target, the element should rightly be named in honor of Russia since the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions at JINR was the only facility in the world which could achieve this result.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yemel'yanova|language=Russian|first=Asya |date=2006-12-17|url=http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=113947|title=118-<U+0439> <U+044D><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0437><U+043E><U+0432><U+0443><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E>-<U+0440><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> (118th element will be named in Russian)|publisher=vesti.ru|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> These names were later proposed for [[flerovium|element 114]] (flerovium) and [[livermorium|element 116]] (moscovium).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=rian.ru|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-08|url=http://ria.ru/science/20110326/358081075.html|title=<U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0439><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0444><U+0438><U+0437><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+043B><U+043E><U+0436><U+0430><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0437><U+0432><U+0430><U+0442><U+044C> 116 <U+0445><U+0438><U+043C><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+044D><U+043B><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0435><U+043C> (Russian Physicians Will Suggest to Name Element 116 Moscovium)|language=Russian}}</ref> However, the final name proposed for element 116 was instead ''livermorium''.<ref name=IUPAC>{{cite web|title=News: Start of the Name Approval Process for the Elements of Atomic Number 114 and 116|url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/start-of-the-name-approval-process-for-the-elements-of-atomic-number-114-and-116.html|work=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

No name has yet been officially suggested for the element as no claims for discovery have yet been accepted by the IUPAC. According to current guidelines from IUPAC, the ultimate name for all new elements should end in "-ium", which means the name for ununoctium will almost certainly end in "-ium", not "-on", even if ununoctium turns out to be a [[noble gas]], which traditionally have names ending in "-on" (with the exception of [[helium]], which was not known to be a noble gas when it was discovered).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac200274050787|url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/2002/pdf/7405x0787.pdf|title=Naming of new elements (IUPAC Recommendations 2002)|year=2002|author=Koppenol, W.

Ununoctium is a member of group 18, the zero-[[valency (chemistry)|valence]] elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common chemical reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer [[valence shell]] is completely filled with [[octet rule|eight electrons]]. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bader|first=Richard F.W|url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/|title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules|publisher=McMaster University|accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> It is thought that similarly, ununoctium has a [[closed shell|closed]] outer valence shell in which its [[valence electron]]s are arranged in a 7s<sup>2</sup>7p<sup>6</sup> [[electron configuration|configuration]].<ref name=Nash/>

Consequently, some expect ununoctium to have similar physical and chemical properties to other members of its group, most closely resembling the noble gas above it in the periodic table, [[radon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm|title=Ununoctium (Uuo) <U+2013> Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects|publisher=Lenntech|accessdate=2008-01-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080116172028/http://lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/Uuo-en.htm |archivedate = January 16, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
Following the [[periodic trend]], ununoctium would be expected to be slightly more reactive than radon. However, theoretical calculations have shown that it could be quite reactive, so that it probably cannot be considered a noble gas.<ref name=Kaldor>{{cite book|title=Theoretical Chemistry and Physics of Heavy and Superheavy Elements|first1=Uzi|last1=Kaldor|first2=Stephen|last2=Wilson|page=105|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-1371-X}}</ref> In addition to being far more reactive than radon, ununoctium may be even more reactive than elements [[flerovium]] and [[copernicium]].<ref name=Nash>{{cite journal|title=Atomic and Molecular Properties of Elements 112, 114, and 118|first=Clinton S.|last=Nash|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|year=2005|volume=109|issue=15|pages=3493<U+2013>3500|doi=10.1021/jp050736o|pmid=16833687|last1=Nash|first1=CS}}</ref> The reason for the apparent enhancement of the chemical activity of ununoctium relative to radon is an energetic destabilization and a radial expansion of the last occupied 7p-[[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]].<ref name=Nash/>{{efn|The actual quote is "The reason for the apparent enhancement of chemical activity of element 118 relative to radon is the energetic destabilization and radial expansion of its occupied 7p<sub>3/2</sub> [[spinor]] shell."}} More precisely, considerable [[spin<U+2013>orbit interaction]]s between the 7p electrons with the inert 7s<sup>2</sup> electrons, effectively lead to a second valence shell closing at [[flerovium]], and a significant decrease in stabilization of the closed shell of element 118.<ref name=Nash/> It has also been calculated that ununoctium, unlike other noble gases, binds an electron with release of energy<U+2014>or in other words, it exhibits positive [[electron affinity]].<ref name=Pyykko>{{cite journal|title=QED corrections to the binding energy of the eka-radon (Z=118) negative ion|first1=Igor|last1=Goidenko|first2=Leonti|last2=Labzowsky|first3=Ephraim|last3=Eliav|first4=Uzi|last4=Kaldor|first5= Pekka |last5=Pyykko<U+00A8>|journal=Physical Review A|volume=67|year=2003|pages=020102(R)|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.67.020102|bibcode = 2003PhRvA..67b0102G|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|volume=77|issue=27|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=1996|title=Element 118: The First Rare Gas with an Electron Affinity|first1=Ephraim |last1=Eliav |first2=Uzi |last2=Kaldor|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.77.5350|pages=5350<U+2013>5352|pmid=10062781|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Y|last4=Pyykk<U+00F6>|first4=P |bibcode=1996PhRvL..77.5350E}}</ref>{{efn|Nevertheless, [[quantum electrodynamic]] corrections have been shown to be quite significant in reducing this affinity by decreasing the binding in the [[anion]] Uuo<sup><U+2212></sup> by 9%, thus confirming the importance of these corrections in [[superheavy element]]s.

Ununoctium is expected to have by far the broadest [[polarizability]] of all elements before it in the periodic table, and almost twofold of radon.<ref name=Nash/> By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it is expected that ununoctium has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K.<ref name=Nash/> This is very different from the previously estimated values of 263&nbsp;K<ref name=Seaborg>{{cite book|title=Modern Alchemy|authorlink=Glenn Theodore Seaborg|first=Glenn Theodore|last=Seaborg|year=1994|isbn=981-02-1440-5|publisher=World Scientific|page =172}}</ref> or 247 K.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=251|issue=2|year=2002|pages=299<U+2013>301|title=Boiling points of the superheavy elements 117 and 118|first=N. |last=Takahashi|doi=10.1023/A:1014880730282}}</ref> Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that ununoctium would be a gas under [[standard conditions]],<ref name=Nash/>{{efn|It is debatable if the name of the group "noble gases" will be changed if ununoctium is shown to be non-volatile.}} and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be [[solid]] at standard conditions. If ununoctium forms a [[gas]] under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions (even if it is [[monatomic]] like the other noble gases).

Because of its tremendous polarizability, ununoctium is expected to have an anomalously low [[ionization energy]] (similar to that of [[lead]] which is 70% of that of radon<ref name=hydride/> and significantly smaller than that of flerovium<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=1999|issue=3|pages=402<U+2013>410|title=Spin-Orbit Effects, VSEPR Theory, and the Electronic Structures of Heavy and Superheavy Group IVA Hydrides and Group VIIIA Tetrafluorides.

No compounds of ununoctium have been synthesized yet, but calculations on [[theoretical chemistry|theoretical compounds]] have been performed since 1964.<ref name=60s>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0022-1902(65)80255-X|year=1965|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd.|title=Some physical and chemical properties of element 118 (Eka-Em) and element 86 (Em)|first=A.

Calculations on the [[diatomic molecule]] {{chem|Uuo|2}} showed a [[chemical bond|bonding]] interaction roughly equivalent to that calculated for {{chem|Hg|2}}, and a [[dissociation energy]] of 6 kJ/mol, roughly 4 times of that of {{chem|Rn|2}}.<ref name=Nash/> But most strikingly, it was calculated to have a [[bond length]] shorter than in {{chem|Rn|2}} by 0.16 <U+00C5>, which would be indicative of a significant bonding interaction.<ref name=Nash/> On the other hand, the compound UuoH<sup>+</sup> exhibits a dissociation energy (in other words [[proton affinity]] of Uuo) that is smaller than that of RnH<sup>+</sup>.<ref name=Nash/>

The bonding between ununoctium and [[hydrogen]] in UuoH is predicted to be very limp and can be regarded as a pure [[van der Waals interaction]] rather than a true [[chemical bond]].<ref name=hydride/> On the other hand, with highly electronegative elements, ununoctium seems to form more stable compounds than for example [[copernicium]] or [[flerovium]].<ref name=hydride/> The stable oxidation states +2 and +4 have been predicted to exist in the [[fluoride]]s {{chem|Uuo||F|2}} and {{chem|Uuo||F|4}}.<ref name=fluoride>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=103|issue=8|pages=1104<U+2013>1108|year=1999|title=Structures of RgFn (Rg = Xe, Rn, and Element 118. n = 2, 4.)
