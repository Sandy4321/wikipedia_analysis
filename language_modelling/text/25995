A '''water column''' is a conceptual column of water from the surface of a sea, river or lake to the bottom sediments.<ref>Munson, B.H., Axler, R., Hagley C., Host G., Merrick G., Richards C. (2004). "[http://waterontheweb.org/resources/glossary.html#W Glossary]". ''Water on the Web''. University of Minnesota-Duluth. Retrieved 27 May 2014.</ref>  Water columns are used chiefly for [[environmental science|environmental studies]] evaluating the [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] or mixing (e.g., by wind-induced currents) of the thermal or chemically stratified layers in a lake, stream or ocean. Some of the common parameters analyzed in the water column are  [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[temperature]], [[salinity]], [[total dissolved solids]], various [[pesticide]]s, [[pathogen]]s and a wide variety of chemicals and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

The concept of ''water column'' is quite important, since many aquatic phenomena are explained by the incomplete vertical mixing of chemical, physical or biological parameters.  For example, when studying the metabolism of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]], it is the specific bottom layer concentration of available [[chemical]]s in the water column that is meaningful, rather than the average value of those chemicals throughout the water column.

[[Hydrostatic pressure]] can be analyzed by the height of a water column, which effectively yields the pressure at a given depth of the column.

The term ''water column'' is also commonly used in [[scuba diving]] to describe the area in which divers ascend and descend.
