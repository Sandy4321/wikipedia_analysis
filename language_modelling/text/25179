'''Highway 401''' (named the '''Macdonald-Cartier Freeway''' and '''The King's Highway No. 401''') is a [[freeway]] that extends across [[Southern Ontario]]. It is the longest [[400-Series Highways|400-Series Highway]] in Ontario and is one of the busiest and widest freeways in the world.<ref name="mto">{{cite web

==History==
[[Image:Carlb-McFreeway401-Mallorytown.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A Highway 401 marker shield displaying the M-C Freeway designation. Few of these shields still exist, as they are no longer posted by the province.]]
The first segment of the highway (originally designated [[Highway 2A (Ontario)|Highway 2A]]) from [[Highland Creek]] (Scarborough) to [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]] was begun in 1938 to bypass a congested section of nearby [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Highway 2]].  Much of the grading and a number of structures were completed before the onset of the [[Second World War]], at which time most of the construction work was shut down. This section was finally completed and opened to traffic in 1947.  

During the war years, the provincial government undertook a number of surveys and studies to determine the most desirable route for the new limited-access highway.

The highway was redesignated ''Highway 401'' in 1952.  The last segment, between [[Gananoque, Ontario|Gananoque]] and [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]], was completed in 1968 to bypass a section along the [[St. Lawrence River]] that included at-grade intersections and private entrances, now called the ''[[Thousand Islands Parkway]]''. The last at-grade intersection on the present alignment was at Joyceville Road, east of Kingston, which was converted to an interchange with the final 1968 construction.

In 1965, [[Ontario Premier]] [[John Robarts]] designated Highway 401 the ''Macdonald-Cartier Freeway'', in honour of Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] and Sir [[George-<U+00C9>tienne Cartier]], the [[Province of Canada]]'s most important [[Canadian Confederation|Fathers of Confederation]], and in recognition of Canada's upcoming Centennial Celebrations in 1967. This name is found on maps and official documents, but seldom used in conversation or on modern [[road sign]]s. A 1961 proposal to name the highway the ''[[Leslie Frost|Leslie M. Frost]] Thruway'' after the recently retired Premier of Ontario was approved by the provincial cabinet, but was not carried out.

==Overview==
[[Image:Carlb-hwy401-lastkm-682.jpg|thumbnail|right|Highway 401 was completed in 1968]]
Highway 401 begins at [[Highway 3 (Ontario)|Highway 3]], 13 [[kilometre]]s (8.08 [[mile]]s) from the [[Detroit River]] on the outskirts of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] (not at the [[Michigan]] border as some mistakenly assume) and ends at the [[Quebec]] border, 815 kilometers (506.42 miles) away. There are 18 [[rest area|rest areas or service centres (oases)]] located along the route, allowing motorists to access services without leaving the highway. A plaque was erected at the Mallorytown oasis, located on the last section of the freeway to be completed, stating that the 401 was the longest non-toll freeway under a single highway authority in North America. (Today the [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Texas section]] of [[Interstate 10]] holds this record.)

Major freeway junctions are located at these roads and highways: [[highway 402 (Ontario)|402]], [[Highbury Avenue]] ([[London, Ontario|London]]), [[highway 403 (Ontario)|403]], [[highway 8 (Ontario)|8]], [[highway 6 (Ontario)|6]], [[highway 407 (Ontario)|407]], [[highway 410 (Ontario)|410]], [[highway 427 (Ontario)|427]], [[highway 400 (Ontario)|400]], [[Allen Road]] ([[Toronto]]), [[highway 404 (Ontario)|404]] and [[Don Valley Parkway]] (Toronto), [[highway 35 (Ontario)|35]] and [[highway 115 (Ontario)|115]], [[highway 416 (Ontario)|416]].  [[Quebec]] [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] continues the highway at its eastern end.

There are no direct interchanges with U.S. [[Interstate highway]]s, but [[Interstate 75|Interstates 75]] and [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|375]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], and [[Interstate 81]] in [[New York|New York State]] are each a short distance away, via Ontario [[highway 3 (Ontario)|highways 3]], the former [[highway 3B (Ontario)|3B]], and [[highway 137 (Ontario)|137]], leading to the [[Ambassador Bridge]], the [[Detroit-Windsor Tunnel]], and the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], respectively. [[Highway 402 (Ontario)|Highway 402]] also links Highway 401 to [[Interstate 69|I-69]]/[[Interstate 94|I-94]] via the [[Bluewater Bridge]] in [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

==Transportation corridor==
[[Image:401donmills.jpg|thumb|250px|The 401 at [[Don Mills Road]].]]
The 401 is considered to be the world's busiest [[highway]], with an estimated Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) of over 500,000 in 2006, between the [[Weston Road]] and [[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]] interchanges in Toronto.<ref name="mto" />  Due to its triple use as the main trade, commuting and recreational corridor in Ontario, 24-hour traffic volumes can exceed the 500,000 level on some days. The [[Just In Time|just-in-time]] inventory systems of the highly integrated auto industry in Michigan and Ontario have made the highway the busiest truck route in the world. Highway 401 also includes the continent's busiest multi-structure bridge at [[Hogg's Hollow Bridge|Hogg's Hollow]] in Toronto (four structures for the highway's four roadway beds).

The 401 is a strategically important highway in Canada, as it connects the populous Southern Ontario region with Quebec and Michigan, while also connecting to most other major highways in the province. The 401 also acts as a 'short cut' between [[Detroit]] and [[Buffalo, New York]] (via [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] and [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]]), and is used by many American motorists for this reason. The highway also serves as the principal connection to [[Montreal]] and points east, including [[New England]], becoming Autoroute 20 at the Quebec border. The border crossing at Windsor and [[Detroit]] is the busiest trade crossing in the world, and although the 401 itself does not physically extend the last few kilometres into Detroit, it is the only route from Toronto to Windsor and on to [[Interstate 75]]. A future expansion of the Windsor-Detroit border crossing, which will include a freeway bypass of the existing Highway 3, may result in Highway 401 having a direct freeway link to the border. Some 40 % of Canada-US trade travels the highway, which is one-third of Canada's foreign trade, and 4 % of all US foreign trade. However, it is not part of the Ontario section of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]].

==Collector-express sections==
[[Image:241325999 6d230b2255 o.jpg|thumb|right|300px||<center>|Highway 401's widest segment is 18 lanes wide, shown at the [[interchange]] with [[Peel Regional Road 4|Dixie Road]].]]
Today the stretch of Highway 401 that passes through the [[Greater Toronto Area]] ranges from 6 to 22 lanes.

===Islington Avenue to Brock Road===
The section that now runs through [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]] was a rural roadway that was entirely outside of the Toronto city limits when first opened, and was originally referred to as the '''Toronto Bypass'''. The new freeway attracted development all along its length. As the city's [[suburb]]s grew, it quickly became an urban commuter road, rather than a long-distance bypass route as was originally planned, leading to extensive traffic jams. This was a problem/opportunity solved and built upon to some extent by implementing separate [[express and collector lanes]], similar to the express/local set-up of the [[Dan Ryan Expressway]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]. Transfers, such as [[The_Basketweave]] allow traffic to move from the express to collector lanes and vice versa. By 1967 Highway 401 was widened from four lanes to 12 or more through Toronto from [[Islington Avenue]] to [[Warden Avenue]].

[[Image:401atDVP.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 401 west of the Don Valley Parkway/Highway 404 junction, showing the wide 14-lane cross-section]]
In the early 1970s the collector express lanes were extended to Neilson Road and eastward to Brock Road by 1997. An alternative plan to the collector-express setup was to construct a bypass of Highway 401. This project was revived in 1987 and opened in 1997 as the toll road [[Highway 407 (Ontario)|Highway 407 ETR]] to parallel Highway 401 in the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. 

The main [[collector-express]] setup with a minimum 12 lane cross-section currently stretches from Islington Avenue to Brock Road. [[Highway 409 (Ontario)|Highway 409]] which branches off from Highway 401 just west of Islington to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] has been unsuccessful in diverting traffic volumes; the 10 lane segment between Islington and [[Highway 427 (Ontario)|Highway 427]] is highly congested as a result. The existing 401-427 interchange is considered one of the worst bottlenecks since it only allows 8 lanes of traffic (4 in each direction) to pass through the interchange. It initially only allowed 6 lanes of through traffic until a widening project was completed in 2005; a major reconstruction of the junction is needed to meet current demands estimated at 5-6 lanes.

===Highway 403/410 to Highway 427===
[[Image:Air France Flight 358.jpg|thumb|right|The four [[Etobicoke Creek]] bridges in the background carrying the 18 lanes of Highway 401's collector-express system. In the foreground is burnt-out wreckage of [[Air France Flight 358]] at [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].]]
Highway 401 has a separate [[collector-express]] system in [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]] between the junctions with Highways [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|403]]/[[Highway 410 (Ontario)|410]] and [[Highway 427 (Ontario)|Highway 427]]. This was completed in 1986, concurrent with the expansion of the 401-403 interchange and the addition of two express flyover ramps and includes an [[The_Basketweave|eastbound collector-express transfer]] known as the "Tunnel." At 18 lanes wide this is the widest section of Highway 401, although at the present only 9 lanes are designated for 401 through traffic (as express lanes) while the collector lanes serve as direct connections or ramp extensions from 403/410 to 427. 

The existing 401/427 interchange remains a bottleneck to possible east expansion of this configuration that would link it up with the Islington-Brock collector-express system. Another choke point is at the 403/410 interchange since the 401 narrows down to 8 lanes west of that junction.  However, that junction has been designed with westward expansion of the collector-express system in mind; several prerequisite projects to accommodate widening from 403/410 to [[Mississauga Road]] were underway in the late 1990s, including a new interchange at [[Mavis Road]] and the reconstruction of the Mississauga Road and Derry Road overpasses.

==Future expansion and upgrades==
{{future road}}
In the 1950s, Highway 401 had initially been constructed as a 4 lane divided highway but the narrow grass median has since proven insufficient in preventing cross-directional collisions. In 1999, the Windsor-London stretch of Highway 401 was infamously known as "Carnage Alley" after several fatal accidents, including an 87 vehicle pileup on Labour Day during thick fog that claimed seven lives. Much work has involves replacing the median strip with an "Ontario tall-wall" concrete barrier and often an extra lane per direction.

Areas currently being upgraded are between Windsor and [[Tilbury, Ontario|Tilbury]], around the City of [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], the [[London, Ontario|London]] area, from [[Port Hope, Ontario]] to [[Cobourg, Ontario|Cobourg]], and west from [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] towards [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]].  This will be followed later by staged upgrades between [[Trenton, Ontario|Trenton]] and [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]], and eventually the remaining sections between Cobourg and Kingston. 

On [[November 14]], [[2005]], the joint Canadian-American committee studying the options for expanding the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] - [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] border crossing announced that its preferred option was to directly extend Highway 401 westward, using a new bridge or tunnel to cross the [[Detroit River]] and interchange with [[Interstate 75]] somewhere between the existing [[Ambassador Bridge]] span and [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]]. The exact route of this new highway connection has not yet been determined.<ref>{{cite news | title=Second span on west side, group urges / Binational committee rejects Schwartz Report truck bypass | first=Anne | last=Jarvis | publisher=[[Windsor Star]] | date=[[15 November]] [[2005]] | url=http://www.canada.com/windsor/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=0114a7c0-c303-4bb4-82d1-83ff9bbc6e99  | accessdate=2006-11-23 }}</ref>

<!-- To make things easier, and to organize them, let's arrange the construction zones from west (Windsor) to east (Quebec boundary).
-->
=== Essex County upgrades ===
==== Highway 3 to Essex County Road 19 ====
The [[Windsor Star]] has reported that the stretch of Highway 401 from [[Highway 3 (Ontario)|Highway 3]] (its western [[terminus]]) to where the road widens to 3 lanes per direction (3 km west of Manning Road) will remain as a four-lane route until a route to a potential new border crossing has been finalized. The MTO intends on upgrading this section, particularly its dangerous interchange with Highway 3 (sharp curves, poor lines of sight, aging overpass structure) when a new bridge and freeway corridor has been chosen.

==== County Road 19 to County Road 42 ====
Highway 401 is seeing a complete overhaul and expansion between the city of [[Windsor, Ontario]] and the town of [[Tilbury, Ontario]], in response to the 87-car pile-up that killed 8 on [[September 3]], [[1999]]. The road is being expanded from two lanes per direction with a narrow grass median to three lanes per direction (with concrete pavement), [[rumble strips]], a concrete divider, and newer overpasses at [[Highway 77 (Ontario)|Highway 77]], French Line Road (St. Joachim Road), and two are planned for Puce Road, Belle River Road, and Former Rochester Township 3rd Concession Road (Eastern Lakeshore). <ref>[http://www.roadinfo.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller/construction/maps/Map.asp?No=1 Ministry of Transportation Road Construction Information]</ref>

The next (and final) phase for upgrading and widening Highway 401 in Essex County is to begin in April of 2007, and will stretch from Belle River Road to Highway 77, widening each carriageway from two to 3 lanes, with a concrete barrier, and should be completed by [[November]] of 2007. This construction zone is roughly the same size as the previous two, at 10.6 km in length, and will create one continuous length of freeway with 6 lanes and a concrete barrier from 2 km west of Manning Road to 1 km east of County Road 42. <ref>[http://www.am800cklw.com/news.php#5433 CKLW-AM 800]</ref>

In addition to the freeway being upgraded, the "Windsor East" Truck Inspection Center and [[Truck scales|weigh scale]] just east of Manning Road will be completed, as it has been expanded and upgraded as well, and is roughly 90% completed.

=== London area upgrades ===
Highway 401 in [[London, Ontario|London]] between Wellington Road and [[Highway 402 (Ontario)|Highway 402]] is currently being widened to six lanes. The improvements will include high mast lighting, a changeable message sign, advanced drainage systems and paved shoulders on both sides of the roadway. This, with the widening projects between [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], will make Highway 401 at least six lanes wide from [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]] to the Highway 402 interchange. Long term plans call for eight lanes in some parts of the city due to its increased use as a commuter road, but these improvements are planned beyond the year 2020. 

Also, the busy Wellington Road interchange in [[London, Ontario|London]] will be completely redesigned and rebuilt as a [[parclo interchange]]. Construction began in 2006. This project is set to be complete by late 2007.

===Oxford County upgrades===
In the late Fall of 2005, the [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ministry of Transportation of Ontario]] started a construction project to upgrade the current 4-lane section of Highway 401 from 4- to 6-lanes from west of Oxford County Road 3 to west of Waterloo Regional Road 97 (where the next 6-lane concrete-divded road begins) in the [[Oxford County, Ontario|County of Oxford]] and [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Waterloo]].

This is currently part of the last 4-laned section between London and Toronto (stretching from Highway 403 Interchange in Woodstock, Ontario to Waterloo Road 97 in Kitchener, Ontario), but is being upgraded to 6 lanes plus an Ontario tall-wall barrier in the median. This is the first stage of upgrades of this final 4-lane section.

In fall 2003, the widening of Highway 401 from four to six lanes from the Highway 8 interchange to Waterloo Regional Road 97 was completed. The Y-junctions with Highway 8 and Highway 403, opened in 1987 and 1990, respectively, were designed in mind to accommodate the widening of Highway 401 through Oxford and Waterloo.

Aside from the addition of one lane per direction and a tall-wall barrier, two emergency ramp connectors that are intended to be used only during emergency highway closures and similar circumstances to permit traffic to move off the freeway (and emergency vehicles onto it) have been constructed.  Built near Oxford Road 3 and Trussler Road, the ramps are are an unprecedented addition to the Ontario highway system. [http://onthighways.com/hwy_401_images/Hwy401_OxCons_images.htm onthighways.com source].

Other emergency accesses have been built in Essex County where the road was recently widened from 4 to 6 lanes, but these are gravel, and all are alongside overpasses, for use by ambulances, firetrucks, and police cars in emergencies only.

This is currently in stages, and will eventually close the 4-lane gap between the two 6-lane sections ([[London, Ontario|London]]/Wellington Road-[[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]]/[[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]] and [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]/Waterloo Road 97 (Cedar Creek Drive)-[[Toronto]]).

The first segment in [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]] to see the upgrades is from Waterloo RR 97 to Oxford CR 3, with further upgrades planned from Oxford CR 3 to Highway 403. Several large upgrades will be carried out here:

* The interchange of Towerline Road and Middletown Line (Exit 236, just north of Highway 403) will be completely rebuilt and redesigned, as its current ramp configuration is extremely dangerous (short ramps with tight curves leading from an intersection just 30 feet/10 meters from the freeway, requiring a driver to "floor it" to get up to speed in time).
* The aging and sagging overpass structure at Towerline Road will be replaced, making this a long-overdue upgrade.
* The [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Former Highway 2]] (Exit 238, which is the final remaining cloverleaf with two divided highways in the province) will be converted to a [[parclo]] interchange, as cloverleafs are no longer up to the Ministry of Transportation's safety standards (mostly from weaving). This will not be a disruptive construction contract, as the traffic volumes at the interchange are actually quite low (which is also why the cloverleaf interchange works smoothly) since former Highway 2 has been all but replaced by Highway 403 in the early 1990s.  This will leave the Highway 4/401 interchange in London, [[Highway 62 (Ontario)|Highway 62]] in [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]], and the former [[Highway 88 (Ontario)|Highway 88]]/[[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]] in [[Bradford, Ontario|Bradford]] as the last [[cloverleaf interchange]]s on a 400-series highway.

===Mississauga upgrades===
There are plans to widen the Mississauga stretch from 6 lanes to 12 lanes from the 403-410 interchange to the Credit River, and 10 lanes to Mississauga Road; this has recently been a major bottleneck due to the reduced capacity west of the junction. Actual construction on the expansion is slated to start in 2008 at the earliest, but for the last decade, numerous prerequisite projects have been undertaken.

The [[Highway_403_%28Ontario%29#401-403-410_interchange|403-410 interchange]], which has been under construction since the 1970s until 1995, is designed in mind for westward expansion of the collector-express system (note the Highway 401 collector overpass structures crossing Highway 410, each of which have an additional lane which is currently unused. There is also an available right-of-way for a loop ramp from Highway 403 northbound to Highway 401 west and a direction ramp in the opposite direction, which is designed to improve access from Cawthra Road; this project would make the [[Highway_403_%28Ontario%29#401-403-410_interchange|403-410 interchange]] a full four-way interchange.

The Kennedy Road overpass, opened in the early 1990s just west of the 403-410 junction, is wide enough to accommodate expansion of the 12 lane collector-express system. The Derry Road underpass have been widened to accommodate this in the late 1990s. An interchange has been added with Mavis Road in 1999, which has been extended north to Highway 401 and beyond, and the overpass abutments are designed to allow future lengthening so fourteen lanes can pass under. In 2002, the Mississauga Road four-lane overpass was replaced with an eight lane structure that can span fourteen lanes, while the interchange ramps were also realigned to support higher speeds. 

The main obstacles to Highway 401 expansion are the aging 1960s Creditview Road, McLaughlin Road, and Hurontario Street (the bridge structure and ramps were realigned in the 1970s from its original cloverleaf configuration) [[overpass]]es which will be demolished and replaced as part of the reconstruction.

==Traffic cameras==
[[Image:loc35.jpg|thumb|401 Traffic Cameria at Toronto Pearson Airport. The smoke in the background is from the crashed [[Air France Flight 358]].]]
To manage traffic, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) installed the [[Freeway Management System - COMPASS]], the most advanced of its kind in the world when it was deployed in 1991 by [[Delcan Corporation]]. Using a combination of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras, vehicle detection loops and LED [[Variable message sign|changeable message signs]], the MTO Traffic Operations Centre can obtain a real-time assessment of traffic conditions and alert highway travellers of collisions and construction. The system currently stretches from [[Highway 403 (Ontario)|Highway 403]], [[Mississauga, Ontario|Mississauga]] to Harwood Avenue, [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]], and is likely to be extended westward and eastward as Highway 401 is reconstructed and upgraded.

==Facts and figures==
Highway 401 has found expression in contemporary music. 
* Kingston, Ontario, [[rock band]] [[The Tragically Hip]]'s 1994 album ''[[Day for Night (Tragically Hip album)|Day for Night]]'' features ''Titanic Terrarium'', whose lyrics include:
:"''...we don't fuck with the 401.  It's bigger than us, or larger than we bargained.''"
* [[Winnipeg]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[James Keelaghan]] referred to The 401 in his 1995 song ''Get to You'':  
:"''There's a rig spun out on 401/Closed it down to cars and vans.''"
* Comedy-folk trio [[The Arrogant Worms]] references the highway in the song ''Horizon'':
:"''One day, on the parking lot they call the 401 / My car became the meat between a Buick-Honda bun...''"
:(Curiously, the song's preamble indicates the events of the song take place in [[Whitby, Ontario]], while later lyrics describe the car spinning into the center median.  However, there is no center median where the 401 passes through Whitby.)
* Toronto rock band [[Staggered Crossing]]'s ''Further Again'' has the lyrics "Heading out on the 401 Don't it make you nervous."
*And [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] has a number of songs dealing with The 401, including ''Bud the Spud'' and ''Canada Day up Canada Way''

==Volume information (2005)==
*Highest Volume: 607,800 AADT from [[Weston Road]] (Exit 357) to [[Highway 400 (Ontario)|Highway 400]] (Exit 359) compared to 510,000 in 2003.
*Lowest Volume: 15,000 AADT from [[Dougall Parkway|Dougall Parkway (Former Highway 3B]] (Exit 13) to [[Highway 3 (Ontario)|Highway 3]], "[[Ambassador Bridge|Bridge to U.S.A.]]"

Until the late 1990s, Highway 401 had blue signs near Windsor and the Greater Toronto Area stating nearby [[Interstate highway]]s in the [[United States]] as "Advantage: [[Interstate 75|I-75]] [[Interstate 80|I-80]] [[Interstate 90|I-90]]", due to the [[Metro Detroit]]-[[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and Greater [[Buffalo, New York]] [[metropolitan area]]s being nearby.

An example of the sign:
{| align="center" border="1" width="250px" id="table1"
! style="background-color:#000080; font-family:Arial; color:#fff; font-size:1.5em;" | ADVANTAGE<br>[[Image:I-75.svg|45px]] [[Image:I-80.svg|45px]] [[Image:I-90.svg|45px]]
