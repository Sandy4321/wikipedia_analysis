The '''1947 Cape Sable hurricane,''' sometimes known informally as '''Hurricane King,''' was a weak [[tropical cyclone]] that became a [[tropical cyclone#Hurricane or typhoon|hurricane]] and caused catastrophic flooding in [[Miami metropolitan area|South Florida]] and the [[Everglades]] in mid-October 1947. The eighth tropical storm and fourth hurricane of the 1947 Atlantic hurricane season, it first developed on October 9 in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]] and hence moved [[boxing the compass|north by west]] until a few days later it struck western Cuba. The cyclone then turned sharply to the northeast, accelerated, and strengthened to a hurricane, within 30 hours crossing the southern Florida peninsula. Across South Florida, the storm produced widespread rainfall up to {{convert|15|in|mm|sign=on}} and severe [[flood]]ing, among the worst ever recorded in the area, that led to efforts by the [[United States Congress]] to improve drainage in the region.

Once over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on October 13, the storm made history when it was the first to be targeted for modification by government and private agencies; dry ice was spread by airplanes throughout the storm in an unsuccessful effort to weaken the hurricane, though changes in the track were initially blamed upon the experiment. On the same day as that of the seeding, the cyclone slowed dramatically and turned westward, making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the morning of October 15 south of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Across the [[U.S. state]]s of Georgia and South Carolina, the small hurricane produced tides up to {{convert|12|ft|m|sign=on}} and significant damage to 1,500 structures, but the death toll was limited to one person. The system dissipated the next day over [[Alabama]], after causing $3.26 million in losses along its path.{{#tag:ref|All damage totals are in 1947 [[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise noted.|group="nb"}}

Unusually, the hurricane strengthened over land as it passed over South Florida, a phenomenon also observed in [[Tropical Storm Fay (2008)]], which struck the same region.<ref name=HURDAT/>

After leaving South Florida, the hurricane passed north of the Bahamas while maintaining its intensity, although a lack of weather observations near its [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] prevented [[weather forecasting|forecasters]] from appraising its exact location and movement.<ref name=MWR />  Early on October 13, the hurricane slowed substantially and began turning to the north; by afternoon, the cyclone had shifted course and turned westward, toward the [[Southeastern United States]].<ref name=HURDAT/> Early on October 14, a [[tropical cyclone observation#Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]] penetrated the storm but only reported winds of up to {{convert|55|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=MWR /> As the storm continued moving west, another mission that entered the center around 00 UTC on October 15 reported hurricane-force winds.<ref name=MWR /> At 12 UTC that day, the storm struck {{convert|15|mi|km|sign=yes}} south of Savannah, Georgia, with winds of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=HURDAT/> At the time, the coverage of hurricane-force winds was small, extending about {{convert|20|mi|km|sign=yes}} in all directions from the eye.<ref name=MWR /> The storm weakened slowly as it crossed inland areas of Georgia, but by 00 UTC on October 16 it weakened to a tropical storm, dissipating 18 hours later over Alabama.<ref name=HURDAT/>

==Preparations==
By October 12, the [[National Weather Service|U.S. Weather Bureau]] issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane warnings]] from the Miami metropolitan area to [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]].<ref name=Warnings>{{cite news|title=Flooded Miami in Hurricane Path|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2R8hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pGQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4066,843723&dq=cuba&hl=en|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=October 12, 1947|page=1}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Florida===
Upon striking southernmost Florida, the cyclone produced insignificant wind damage of $75,000 (1947 USD),<ref name=MWR /> largely due to its having struck an area hit by the more powerful [[1947 Fort Lauderdale hurricane]] in September.<ref name=MWR /><ref name=Norcross /> Peak winds in Florida were estimated to have reached {{convert|95|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} around Cape Sable, the area where the storm made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]],<ref name=Barnes />  though these were not officially accepted as the maximum sustained winds.<ref name=HURDAT /> At the [[Dry Tortugas]], wind instruments reported readings up to {{convert|84|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} before failing due to <U+201C>friction from lack of oil<U+201D>;<ref name=Barnes /> higher winds were believed to have occurred thereafter.<ref name=MWR /> Elsewhere in South Florida, the U.S. Weather Bureau Air Station at [[Miami International Airport]] reported sustained winds of {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=Barnes />  while the Weather Bureau Office in downtown Miami recorded peak winds of {{convert|62|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name=MWR /> Between the two stations, each {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} apart, the difference in atmospheric pressure was 3 mb (0.09 inHg), but the lowest pressure was not below 995.3 mb (29.39 inHg).<ref name=MWR /> As the storm center passed just north of Fort Lauderdale, the city at 0700 UTC on October 12 reported a pressure of 982.1 mb (29 inHg) that was <U+201C>still falling<U+201D> at the time.<ref name=Pressure>{{cite news|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=October 12, 1947|page=1}}</ref> The eye of the storm by 0830 UTC passed over the [[Hillsboro Inlet Lighthouse]], which reported calm winds for an hour<U+2014>the second time in less than a month in which the eye of a hurricane passed over or near the lighthouse, the other having occurred on September 17.<ref name=Norcross /><ref name=MWR />

Region-wide, the hurricane produced significant [[rain]]fall totals of {{convert|5|in|mm|sign=on}} to {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}}<U+2014>and, in the interior, locally as high as {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref name=Kleinberg>Kleinberg, p. 220</ref><U+2014>causing severe flooding.<ref name=Norcross /> The highest measured rainfall total in 24 hours in South Florida was {{convert|14.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} in northeastern [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].<ref name=Rainfall>{{cite journal|last=Schoner|first=R.

The flooding that resulted from the storm and the earlier September hurricane was among the worst ever recorded in South Florida and became known as the <U+201C>Flood of 1947<U+201D> or, as the ''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'' newspaper in 1990 called it, the <U+201C>the Great South Florida Flood.<U+201D><ref name=Flood /> The rains from the storms followed an abnormally wet [[rainy season]] in the spring of 1947 that raised the water table to dangerous levels and by July forced several emergency meetings by the [[Draining and development of the Everglades#Broward's "Empire of the Everglades"|Everglades Drainage District (EDD)]] to address widespread flooding.<ref name=Herald /><ref name=McIver /> Despite the measures, which resulted in the opening of floodgates to relieve flooded farmlands by diverting water through back-pumping to [[Lake Okeechobee]], lack of funding hampered efforts by EDD Chief Engineer Lamar Johnson to address the situation.<ref name=Flood /> After the October hurricane struck Florida, eleven counties extending south from [[Osceola County, Florida]], were at least 50% flooded<ref name=Herald /><ref name=MWR /><U+2014>roughly 90% of the land mass from [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] to the [[Florida Keys]].<ref name=Flood /> South of Lake Okeechobee, a sheet of standing water covering {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} across and ranging from {{convert|6|in|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep inundated much of the region, including the [[Everglades]].<ref name=Herald /> In the region, {{convert|5,000,000|acre|ha|sign=on}}  of land were flooded as abnormally high coastal tides prevented water from being released through canals to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=Flood /> The flooding divided many communities: near Fort Lauderdale, a temporary dam that had been erected by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] to protect [[Davie, Florida|Davie]]<U+2014>a town in which 90% of the homes by the end of October were at least partially submerged<ref name=Herald /><U+2014>lowered waters in some areas but merely diverted them to others, flooding a neighborhood and leading to angry complaints by residents; the situation worsened after the October hurricane produced even more rain over flooded South Florida.<ref name=Flood />

===Georgia and South Carolina===
Upon making landfall, the storm produced high tides of up to {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], and {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Up to 1,500 or more buildings were significantly damaged due to wind gusts that reached {{convert|95|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at Savannah, Georgia. One person died due to high tides preceding the storm. Total property losses in Georgia and South Carolina reached $2,185,000 (1947 USD).<ref name=Events>{{cite journal|journal=Monthly Weather Review|year=1947|month=September|volume=75|issue=10|pages=203<U+2013>4|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1947)075<0203:SLSFO>2.0.CO;2|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/075/mwr-075-10-0203.pdf|title=Severe Local Storms for October 1947|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
In South Florida, the flooding from the September and October hurricanes led to the creation in 1949 of what is now the [[South Florida Water Management District]], which under a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] plan was entrusted with the task of preventing a recurrence of significant flooding by forming an improved flood-control system to modulate the water table and by providing suitable water levels with which to water crops, prevent saltwater intrusion, and support recreational opportunities as well as the growing South Florida communities.<ref name=McIver /><ref name=Herald /><ref name=Flood />  Large pumping systems were constructed, along with numerous new levees and canals, to mitigate the risk of large-scale flooding, yet population growth since the late 1940s is believed to have reduced the extent of vacant lands needed for effective drainage, thereby increasing the risk of damage during a flood similar to that of 1947.<ref name=Norcross /> In his 1974 book ''Beyond the Fourth Generation,'' former EDD Chief Engineer Lamar Johnson voiced his concerns about large-scale development near the levees, which separate the Everglades water conservation areas from the Miami metropolitan area. Johnson wrote, <U+201C>It is my opinion...that anytime that area gets a foot or more of rainfall overnight, the shades of 1947<U+2019>s flood will be with them again.<U+201D><ref name=Johnson>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Lamar|title=Beyond the Fourth Generation|year=1974|publisher=University Press of Florida|isbn=978-0813003986}}</ref>

The cyclone was historically significant in that it was the first tropical cyclone to be [[Project Stormfury#Project Cirrus|modified]] as part of a multi-year operation called Project Cirrus.<ref name=Barnes /><ref name=Norcross /> In July 1946, [[General Electric|General Electric (GE)]] scientists concluded after experimentation that [[dry ice]] seeding could induce heavy rainfall and thus ultimately weaken storms by cooling temperatures in the eye.<ref name=Norcross /> To undertake Project Cirrus, GE, the [[United States Army]], the [[Office of Naval Research]], and the U.S. Weather Bureau functioned jointly on research and planning.<ref name=Barnes /> Early on October 13, 1947, {{convert|200|lb|oz|sign=on}} of dry ice were dropped throughout the storm, then located about {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. While the appearance of the clouds changed, the initial results of the seeding were inconclusive. Shortly after the seeding took place, the hurricane turned sharply toward the Southeastern United States. While the move the leading GE scientist later blamed upon the seeding, subsequent examination of the environment surrounding the storm determined that a large upper-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] was in fact responsible for the abrupt turn.<ref name=Norcross />

Following the [[Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet|phonetic alphabet]] from [[World War II]], the [[National Weather Service#History|U.S. Weather Bureau]] office in [[Miami, Florida]], which then worked in conjunction with the military, named the storm '''King,'''<ref name=Norcross /><ref name=Barnes /> though such names were apparently informal and did not appear in public advisories until [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season|1950]], when the first Atlantic storm to be so designated was [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Fox|Hurricane Fox]].<ref name=Norcross />
