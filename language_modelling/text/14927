The '''Druze''' or '''Druz''' (also known as Druse; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''derz<U+012B>'' or ''durz<U+012B>'' <U+062F><U+0631><U+0632><U+064A>, pl. ''dur<U+016B>z'' <U+062F><U+0631><U+0648><U+0632>, {{lang-he|<U+05D3><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05D6><U+05D9><U+05DD>}}, Druzim) are a distinct religious community based mostly in the [[Middle East]] who are an offshoot of [[Islam]] and influenced by other religions and philosophies, including [[Greek philosophy]]. The Druze consider themselves politically as "an Islamic Unist, reformatory sect",<ref>''Al-Ma<U+00F0>hab at-Taw<U+1E25><U+012B>d<U+012B> ad-Durz<U+012B>'' p. 66 by Najib Israwi, cited in Samy Swayd 1998, ''The Druzes: An Annotated Bibliography'', ISBN 0-9662932-0-7</ref> although they are not considered [[Muslim]]s by most Muslims in the region. The Druze call themselves ''[[The People of Monotheism]]'' or ''Muwahhid<U+016B>n'' ("Monotheists"). The origin of the name ''Druze'' is traced to [[Nashtakeen al-Darazi]], The first person to spread the religion.

==Location==
The Druze reside primarily in [[Lebanon]], with smaller communities in [[Israel]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]].

Large communities of expatriate Druze also live outside the [[Middle East]], in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Latin America]], [[West Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. They use the [[Arabic language]] and follow a social pattern very similar to the East Mediterraneans of the region. While most Druze consider themselves [[Arabs]], some living in Israel do not.<ref>Walid Jumblatt, head of Lebanese Progressive Party.  [http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_1-2-2004_pg3_5 Op-ed: 'The Arabs must unite above all else'] (free registration required).</ref>

There are thought to be as many as 1 million Druze worldwide, the vast majority in the [[Levant]] or East Mediterranean.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3612002.stm Druze set to visit Syria] BBC News Online, 30 August 2004.

==History of the Druze==

The religion developed out of [[Ismaili]] Islam, a philosophical movement based in the [[Fatimids|F<U+0101>timid]] [[Caliphate]], in the [[10th century]], a time of particular cultural wealth. The religion did not attempt to change mainstream Islam but to create a whole new religious body influenced by [[Greek philosophy]], [[Gnosticism]] and [[Christianity]], among others{{Fact}}.

The main actors of the early years were two: The pious F<U+0101>timid ruler ''Tariqu l-<U+1E24>akim'' (985<U+2013>1021)--also known as [[Al-hakim]] or ''[[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-<U+1E24>akim bi-<U+02E4>Amru l-L<U+0101>h]]'' ("Ruler in the Name of God")--was an Ismaili caliph from Egypt believed by some to be an actual incarnation of God.  The Persian immigrant [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad|Hamza ibn <U+02E4>Al<U+012B> ibn A<U+1E25>mad]] was the main architect of the movement. It was [[Shi'a Imam|Im<U+0101>m]] <U+1E24>amza who first publicly proclaimed <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m to be more than human.

The early Druze community faced a strong challenge when Mu<U+1E25>ammad ad-Daraz<U+012B> declared <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m's divinity and claimed to be his chief messenger. It is said that <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m was angered by this and had Daraz<U+012B> executed. Meanwhile, Hamza and his moderate followers, who had rejected that <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m was the incarnation of God, received his favour and were protected until he disappeared one night in 1021. The Druze believe that <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m went into [[occultation]] and will return in the [[Eschatology|end of days]] as the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Q<U+0101>'im]] "Ariser" or [[Mahdi]] "Guider".

After the death (resp. the hiding''/al-ghaiba'') of <U+1E24>ak<U+012B>m, the Druze were forced to move and use the (accepted) practice of ''[[taqiyya]]'' "dissimulation", whereby they concealed their true beliefs and outwardly accepted the religious beliefs of those amongst whom they lived even as they secretly retained their true convictions.

In [[1167]], noted traveler [[Benjamin of Tudela]] wrote about the Druze in his diary. He describes the Druze as "Mountain dwellers, monotheists, believe in soul transfigurations and are good friends with the [[Jews]]".

The Druze have played major roles in the history of the [[Levant]]. They were mostly scattered in the [[Chouf Mountains]], which are part of [[Mount Lebanon]] (known for some time as the Mount of the Druzes), and later the eponymous [[Jabal el-Dourouz|Jabal al-Dur<U+016B>z (Mount of the Druzes)]] in [[Syria]].

The Druze also played a major role in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] ([[1975]]<U+2013>[[1990]]). They organized a [[militia]] (one of the strongest militias in the War) under the leadership of [[Walid Jumblatt]], (son of [[Kamal Jumblatt]]), in opposition to the [[Maronite]] Christian [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist]] militia of [[Bachir Gemayel]] in the Mount Lebanon area (especially the Chouf) where the Druze militia were successful in winning the war. A peace treaty was then signed between the Druze and Maronite leaders which has enabled them to live peacefully together and later become allies.

==The Druze today==

In Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, the Druze have official recognition as a separate religious community with its own religious court system. Their symbol is an array of five colors: green, red, yellow, blue and white. Each color pertains to a symbol defining its principles: green for ''<U+02E4>Aql'' "the Universal Mind", red for ''R<U+016B><U+0127>'' "the Universal Soul", yellow for ''Kalima''
"the Truth/Word", blue for ''Sabq'' "the Antagonist/Cause" and white for ''Tal<U+012B>'' "the Protagonist/Effect". These principles are why the number [[5 (number)|five]] has special considerations among the religious community; it is usually represented symbolically as a five-pointed star.

Although often politically recognized as Muslims, Druzes do not consider themselves Muslims, since they are not followers of the [[five pillars of Islam]], or of any particular prophet.

In [[Israel]], Druze usually identify themselves as [[Arab]]s (but not as [[Palestinian]]s).<ref>''Identity Repertoires among Arabs in Israel'', by Muhammad Amara and Izhak Schnell; ''Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies'', Vol. 30, 2004</ref> Druze in [[Israel]] are known to be loyal and patriotic Israelis. Lately, [[Azzam Azzam]], a Druze Israeli businessman, was accused by Egypt of spying for Israel and was imprisoned for seven years. The Israeli government denied this accusation.

However, many Druze living in the [[Golan Heights]] consider themselves [[Syria]]n and refuse Israeli citizenship, while the remainder consider themselves Israeli. In general elections, the majority of Druze villages have similar voting patterns as the general public.

Israeli Druze also serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]], voluntarily since [[1948]], and&mdash;at the community's request&mdash;compulsorily since [[1956]]. Their privileges and responsibilities are the same as those of Israeli Jews; thus, all Druze are drafted, but exemptions are given for religious students and for various other reasons. Most recently in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|2006 conflict]] in Lebanon, the all-Druze ''Herev'' [sword] Battalion, through their knowledge of the Lebanese terrain, suffered no casualties and are reported to have killed 20 [[Hezbollah]] fighters, triggering suggestions that the battalion will be transformed into an elite unit<ref>[http://www.israelnn.com/news.php3?id=110102 "Druze Herev Battalion Fights 32 Days With No Casualties", Israel National News]</ref>.

In January 2004, the spiritual leader of the Druze community in Israel, Shaykh [[Mowafak Tarif]], signed a declaration calling on all non-Jews in Israel to observe the [[Seven Noahide Laws]] as laid down in the [[Bible]] and expounded upon in [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition. The mayor of the [[Galilee|Galilean]] city of [[Shfaram]] also signed the document {{fact}}. The declaration includes the commitment to make a "...better humane world based on the Seven Noahide Commandments and the values they represent commanded by the Creator to all mankind through Moses on [[Mount Sinai]]."

Support for the spread of the Seven Noahide Commandments by the Druze leaders reflects the biblical narrative itself. The Druze community reveres the non-Jewish father-in-law of Moses, [[Jethro]], whom Muslims call [[Shoaib|Shu<U+02E4>ayb]]. According to the biblical narrative, Jethro joined and assisted the Jewish people in the desert during the [[Exodus]], accepted monotheism, but ultimately rejoined his own people. In fact, the tomb of Jethro near [[Tiberias]] is the most important religious site for the Druze community. [http://www.arutzsheva.com/news.php3?id=56379]


== Prominent Druze figures ==
{{main|List of Druze}}

*[[Kamal Jumblatt]] founded the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] [[Progressive Socialist Party]] in the mid-20th century and was a major thinker and philosopher; his son [[Walid Jumblatt]] remains prominent in Lebanese politics.
*In Israel, [[Salah Tarif]], a former captain in the paratrooper and the tank divisions of the Israeli Army, has been a [[Knesset]] member since 1992. He has served as the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs and was appointed [[Minister Without Portfolio]] in the Sharon government of 2001.

Al-Atrache revived the Eastern musical traditions with such pieces as "Lahn al-Khulud" and the Rabeeh Opera.
*Radio announcer [[Casey Kasem]], born Kamal Amin Kasem to Lebanese Druze immigrants to the USA, is probably that country's most well-known figure of Druze heritage. About 50,000 Druze live in the United States.
*Sultan [[Basha al Atrash]] was leader of the revolution against the French occupation of Lebanon and Syria in the 1920s. He is viewed by many Druze, as well as many non-Druze Arabs, as a symbol of courage and defiance to outside influence and occupation.
*[[Samir Kuntar]], a Lebanese [[Palestine Liberation Front|PLF]] member who infiltrated into Israel in 1979 and killed four people, amongst them a four year-old girl and her father.

==Beliefs of the Druze==
The Druze faith keeps its tenets secret. They are publicly open about very few details of their faith (they practice [[taqiyya]]) and they do not accept converts and strongly discourage conversion from their religion to another. This is due to many religious, political, and historical reasons: the Druze were violently and brutally persecuted for centuries by other religious communities.     
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:pythagorasd.jpg|thumb|300px|Thinkers like Pythagoras are respected and even considered prophets in Druze faith]] -->

The Druze believe in the unity of God, hence their preference for the name "People of Monotheism" or "Monotheists". Their [[theology]] has a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] view about how God interacts with the world through emanations and is similar to some [[gnosticism|gnostic]] and other [[esotericism|esoteric]] sects. They are not, however, influenced by the [[Sufi]] philosophy, as many believe.  The Druze believe in reincarnation and are pantheistic.

The principles of the Druze faith are: guarding one's tongue (honesty), protecting one's brother, respecting the elderly, helping others, protecting one's homeland, and belief in one God. Another well-known feature of the Druze religion is a fervent belief in human-only [[reincarnation]] for all the members of the community. They reject [[polygamy]], [[tobacco smoking]], [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], or consumption of [[pork]], although pork and alcohol may be consumed in many non-religious and/or [[al-Juhl]] households.

Druze religion does not allow them to intermarry with [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], or members of any other religions. 

It is also known that Druze believe in five cosmic principles, represented by the five colored Druze star: intelligence/reason (green), soul (red), word (yellow), precedent (blue), and [[immanence]] (white). These virtues take the shape of five different spirits which, until recently, have been continuously reincarnated on Earth as prophets and philosophers including [[Adam and Eve|Adam]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Akhenaten]], and many others. The Druze believe that, in every time period, these five principles were personified in five different people who came down together to Earth to teach humans the true path to God and [[nirvana]], but that with them came five other individuals who would lead people away from the right path into "darkness".

The Druze believe in prophets like [[Adam]], [[Noah]] (''N<U+016B><U+0127>''), [[Abraham]] (''Ibr<U+0101>h<U+012B>m''), [[Sarah]], [[Jacob]] (''Ya<U+02E4>qub''), [[Moses]] (''M<U+016B>s<U+0101>''), [[Solomon]] (''Sulaym<U+0101>n''), [[John the Baptist]] (''Yahya''), and [[Jesus]] (''Is<U+0101>'') (as mentioned above, in contrast to members of the other monotheistic faiths, they also elevate Jethro, or Shu<U+02E4>ayb, [[father-in-law]] of M<U+016B>s<U+0101>, to the status of major prophet). They also believe in the wisdom of classical Greek [[philosopher]]s such as [[Plato]] and [[Pythagoras]], who have the same stature as other prophets. In addition, they have an array of "wise men" that founded the religion in the [[11th century]].

Individual [[prayer]] does not exist. Druze are not required to follow the Muslim duties of prayer, fasting, or pilgrimage to [[Mecca]].

One of the faith's holy books is called the ''Kit<U+0101>bu l-<U+0126>ikma'' or "Book of Wisdom", largely compiled by a mysterious figure called [[Muqtana|al-Muqtana]]. It has six volumes and is compiled in [[chapter (books)|chapter]]s, each covering a specific issue. The teachings denounce materialism, especially materialism relative to religion.

===<U+02E4>Uqq<U+0101>l and Juhh<U+0101>l===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Sheikh_druze.jpg|thumb|200px|Druze Sheikh (member of the <U+02E4>uqq<U+0101>l)]] -->
The Druze are split into two groups. The outer group, called ''al-Juhh<U+0101>l'' (<U+062C><U+0647><U+0627><U+0644>), "the Ignorant", are not granted access to the secret Druze holy literature. They form the Druze political and military leadership and generally distance themselves from religious issues. They comprise perhaps 90% of the Druze.

The inner group are called ''al-<U+02E4>Uqq<U+0101>l'' (<U+0639><U+0642><U+0627><U+0644>), "the Knowledgeable Initiates". Women are considered especially suitable to become <U+02E4>Uqq<U+0101>l; they are regarded to be spiritually superior to men.

Druze women who are <U+02E4>uqq<U+0101>l can opt to wear ''al-mand<U+012B>l'', a transparent loose white [[veil]], especially in the presence of religious figures. They wear ''al-mand<U+012B>l'' on their head to cover their hair and wrap it around their mouth and sometimes over their nose as well. They wear black shirts and long skirts covering their legs to their ankles. Male ''<U+02E4>uqq<U+0101>l'' grow moustaches, shave their heads, and wear dark clothing with white turbans.

The <U+02E4>uqq<U+0101>l themselves are also divided into two groups; about 10% are ''al-Ajaw<U+012B>d'', a term that means "The Good Ones (diminutive)". They are the leaders of the spiritual life of the Druze.

Druze places of worship are usually very modest and the Ajaw<U+012B>d lead very modest lifestyles. Prayer is usually conducted discreetly, among family and friends. There is little official hierarchy in the religious community except for the ''[[Shaykh]] al-<U+02E4>Aql'', whose role is more political and social than religious. A religious figure is admired for his wisdom and lifestyle.

Contradictory literature surrounds the Druze mainly due to adopted beliefs that were used to protect them from persecutors and due to the rumors and stories of outsiders. For example, it is still unclear to most outsiders whether the Druze follow the same traditions of fasting as Muslims in the month of [[Ramadan]]. This is because the Druze have followed these traditions for centuries in order to protect themselves. Many orthodox Druze hold that they should not follow these traditions, but should follow a different fasting tradition still practiced by religious figures instead. The Druze have other fasting traditions, such as fasting during the ten days before [[Eid ul-Adha]], the last night of which is spent in prayer. The Druze fast is more difficult than the traditional Ramadan fast in that only one light meal is allowed in the evening.
