'''Persian literature''' ({{PerB|<U+0627><U+062F><U+0628><U+06CC><U+0627><U+062A> <U+067E><U+0627><U+0631><U+0633><U+06CC>}}) spans two and a half millennia, though much of the pre-Islamic material has been lost. Its sources often come from far-flung regions beyond the borders of present-day Iran, as the Persian language flourished and survives across wide swaths of [[Central Asia]]. For instance, [[Rumi]], one of Persia's (and Islam's) best-loved poets, wrote in Persian but lived in [[Konya]], now in [[Turkey]] and then the capital of the [[Seljuks]]. The [[Ghaznavids]] conquered large territories in Central and [[South Asia]] and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from areas that are now part of [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Central Asia]]. Not all this [[literature]] is written in [[Persian language|Persian]], as some consider works written by ethnic [[Persians]] in other languages, such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], to be included.

Surviving works in [[Persian language]]s (such as [[Old Persian]] or [[Middle Persian]]) date back as far as 650 BCE, the date of the earliest surviving [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions. The bulk of the surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] circa 650 CE. After the [[Abbasid]]s came to power (750 CE), the Persians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic empire and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. Persians wrote both in Arabic and Persian; Persian predominated in later literary circles. Persian poets such as [[Saadi|Sa'di]], [[Hafez (poet)|Hafiz]], [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]] and [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m|Omar Khayyam]] are well known in the world and have influenced the literature of many countries.

==Classical Persian literature==
=== Pre-Islamic Iranian literature ===
{{See also|Pahlavi literature}}
Very few literary works remain from ancient Persia. Most of these consist of the royal inscriptions of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] kings, particularly Darius I (522<U+2013>486 BC) and his son Xerxes. Zoroastrian writings mainly were destroyed in the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]]. The [[Parsi]]s who fled to India, however, took with them some of the books of the Zoroastrian canon, including some of the [[Avesta]] and ancient commentaries (''Zend'') thereof. Some works of Sassanid geography and travel also survived albeit in Arabic translations.

No single text devoted to [[literary criticism]] has survived from pre-Islamic Persia. However, some essays in [[Pahlavi]] such as <U+2018><U+2019>Ayin-e name nebeshtan" and "Bab-e edteda<U+2019>I-ye" ([[Panchatantra|Kalile va Demne]]) have been considered as literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1959).<ref>Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, ''Naqde adabi'', Tehran 1959 pp:374-379.</ref>
Some researchers have quoted the ''Sho<U+2019>ubiyye'' as asserting that the pre-Islamic Persians had books on eloquence, such as ''Karvand''. No trace remains of such books. There are some indications that some among the Persian elite were familiar with Greek rhetoric and literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1947).

=== Persian literature of the medieval and pre-modern periods ===

While initially [[Islamization in Iran|overshadowed by Arabic]] during the [[Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid]] caliphates, modern Persian soon became a literary language again of the [[Central Asia]]n lands.
The rebirth of the language in its new form is often accredited to [[Ferdowsi]], [[Unsuri]], [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqiqi]], [[Rudaki]], and their generation, as they used pre-Islamic nationalism as a conduit to revive the language and customs of ancient Persia.

In particular, says [[Ferdowsi]] himself in his [[Shahnameh|Shahnama]]:

<U+0628><U+0633><U+06CC> <U+0631><U+0646><U+062C> <U+0628><U+0631><U+062F><U+0645> <U+062F><U+0631> <U+0627><U+06CC><U+0646> <U+0633><U+0627><U+0644> <U+0633><U+06CC><br>
<U+0639><U+062C><U+0645> <U+0632><U+0646><U+062F><U+0647> <U+06A9><U+0631><U+062F><U+0645> <U+0628><U+062F><U+06CC><U+0646> <U+067E><U+0627><U+0631><U+0633><U+06CC>

''"For thirty years, I endured much pain and strife,''<br>
''with Persian I gave the [[Ajam]] verve and life".''  

====Poetry====
So strong is the Persian aptitude for versifying everyday expressions that one can encounter poetry in almost every classical work, whether from Persian literature, science, or metaphysics. In short, the ability to write in verse form was a pre-requisite for any scholar. For example, almost half of [[Avicenna]]'s medical writings are in verse.

Works of the early era of Persian poetry are characterized by strong court patronage, an extravagance of [[panegyrics]], and what is known as <U+0633><U+0628><U+06A9> <U+0641><U+0627><U+062E><U+0631> "exalted in  style". The tradition of royal patronage began perhaps under the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] era and carried over through the [[Abbasid]] and [[Samanid dynasty|Samanid]] courts into every major [[List of kings of Persia|Persian dynasty]]. The [[Qasida]] was perhaps the most famous form of panegyric used, though [[quatrain]]s such as those in [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m|Omar Khayyam]]'s [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Ruba'iyyat]] are also widely popular.

"Khorasani style", whose followers mostly were associated with [[Greater Khorasan]], is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. The chief representatives of this lyricism are [[Asjadi]], [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Manuchihri|Manuchehri]]. Panegyric masters such as [[Rudaki]] were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.

Through these courts and system of patronage emerged the epic style of poetry, with [[Ferdowsi]]'s  [[Shahnama]] at the apex. By glorifying the [[History of Iran|Iranian historical past]] in heroic and elevated verses, he and other notables such as [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqiqi]] and [[Asadi Tusi]] presented the "[[Ajam]]" with a source of pride and inspiration that has helped preserve a sense of identity for the [[Iranian peoples]] over the ages. Ferdowsi set a model to be followed by a host of other poets later on.

The thirteenth century marks the ascendancy of lyric poetry with the consequent development of the [[ghazal]] into a major verse form, as well as the rise of mystical and [[Sufi poetry]]. This style is often called ''"the Eraqi style"'', and is known by its emotional lyric qualities, rich meters, and the relative simplicity of its language. Emotional romantic poetry was not something new however, as works such as [[Vis u Ramin|Vis o Ramin]] by [[Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani|Asad Gorgani]], and ''Yusof o Zoleikha'' by [[Am'aq]] exemplify. Poets such as [[Sana'i]] and [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] (who ostensibly have inspired [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]]), [[Khaqani Shirvani]], [[Anvari]], and [[Nezami]], were highly respected ghazal writers. However, the elite of this school are [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], [[Saadi (poet)|Sadi]], and [[Hafez|Hafez]].

Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era, Persian historian [[Ehsan Yarshater]] notes, "As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into [[Central Asia]] produced many young [[slavery|slaves]]. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was [[Pederasty|love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions]] which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal."<ref>Yar-Shater, Ehsan. 1986. ''Persian Poetry in the Timurid and Safavid Periods,'' Cambridge History of Iran. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.973-974. 1986</ref>

In the [[didactic]] genre one can mention [[Sanai]]'s ''Hadiqatul Haqiqah'' as well as [[Nezami]]'s ''Makhzan-ul-Asr<U+0101>r''. Some of [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]]'s works also belong to this genre as do the major works of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], although some tend to classify these in the lyrical type due to their mystical and emotional qualities. In addition, some tend to group [[Naser Khosrow]]'s works in this style as well; however the true gem of this genre is [[Saadi|Sadi]]'s ''[[Bostan|Bustan]]'', a heavyweight of Persian literature.

After the fifteenth century, the ''Indian style'' of Persian poetry (sometimes also called ''Isfahani'' or ''Safavi'' styles) took over. This style has its roots in the [[Timurid]] era and produced the likes of [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khosrow Dehlavi]].

==== Essays ====
The most significant essays of this era are [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizami Arudhi Samarqandi]]'s ''"Chah<U+0101>r Maq<U+0101>leh"'' as well as [[Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi]]'s [[anecdote]] compendium ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]''.
[[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir]]'s famous work, the ''[[Qabus nama]]'' (''A Mirror for Princes''), is a highly esteemed [[Belles-lettres]] work of Persian literature. Also highly regarded is ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a famous Persian [[vizier]]. ''[[Panchatantra|Kelileh va Demneh]]'', translated from [[India]]n folk tales, can also be mentioned in this category. It is seen as a collection of adages in Persian literary studies and thus does not convey folkloric notions.

==== Biographies, hagiographies, and historical works====
Among the major historical and biographical works in classical Persian, one can mention [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi|Abolfazl Beyhaghi]]'s famous ''Tarikh-i Beyhaqi'', ''[[Lubab ul-Albab]]'' of [[Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi]] (which has been regarded as a reliable chronological source by many experts), as well as [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni]]'s famous ''[[Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini]]'' (which spans the Mongolid and [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanid]] era of [[Iran]]). [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]]'s ''[[Tadkhirat al-Awliya]]'' ("Biographies of the Saints") is also a detailed account of [[Sufi]] mystics, which is referenced by many subsequent authors and considered a significant work in mystical [[hagiography]].

==== Literary criticism ====
The oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism after the Islamic conquest of Persia is ''Muqaddame-ye Shahname-ye Abu Mansuri'', which was written in the Samanid period. The work deals with the myths and legends of [[Shahnameh|Shahname]] and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose. It also shows an attempt by the authors to evaluate literary works critically.

====Persian story writing ====

''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-fa|<U+0647><U+0632><U+0627><U+0631> <U+0648> <U+06CC><U+06A9> <U+0634><U+0628>}}) is a medieval Persian literary [[Epic poetry|epic]] which tells the story of [[Scheherazade]] (''<U+0160>arz<U+0101>d'' in Persian), a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King [[Shahryar#Shahry<U+0101>r|Shahryar (''<U+0160>ahry<U+0101>r'')]], to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day.  The individual stories were created over many centuries, by many people and in many styles, and many have become famous in their own right.  Notable examples include ''[[Aladdin]]'', ''[[Ali Baba|Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]'', and ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor]]''.

The nucleus of the stories is formed by a [[Pahlavi]] Sassanid [[Persian language|Persian]] book called ''Haz<U+0101>r Afs<U+0101>nah''<ref> Abdol Hossein Saeedian, ''"Land and People of Iran"'' p. 447</ref> (''Thousand Myths'', in {{lang-fa|<U+0647><U+0632><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627><U+0641><U+0633><U+0627><U+0646><U+0647>}}), a collection of ancient Indian and Persian folk tales.
During the reign of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] in the [[8th century|eighth century]], [[Baghdad]] had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[China]], [[India]], Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time,  many of the stories that were originally folk stories were thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller ''Abu abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar''. The [[frame story]] of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the fourteenth century.

==Dictionaries==
[[Image:Dehkhoda book cover.gif|thumb|right|[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]] is the largest ever lexical compilation of the [[Persian language]] and literature.]]
[[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda|Dehkhoda]] names 200 Persian lexicographical works in his monumental [[Dehkhoda Dictionary]], the earliest, ''Farhang-i Avim'' (<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0627><U+0648><U+06CC><U+0645>) and ''Farhang-i Menakhtay'' (<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0645><U+0646><U+0627><U+062E><U+062A><U+0627><U+06CC>), from the late [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] era. The most widely used Persian [[lexicon]]s in the [[Middle Ages]] were those of [[Abu Hafs Soghdi]] (<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0627><U+0628><U+0648> <U+062D><U+0641><U+0635> <U+0633><U+063A><U+062F><U+06CC>) and [[Asadi Tusi]] (<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0644><U+063A><U+062A> <U+0641><U+0631><U+0633>), written in 1092. Also highly regarded in the Persian literature lexical corpus are the works of [[Mohammad Moin]].

In 1645, Ravius and Lugduni completed a Persian-[[Latin]] dictionary. This was followed by [[J. Richardson]]'s two-volume Oxford edition (1777) and Gladwin-Malda's (1770) Persian-English Dictionaries, Scharif and S. Peters' Persian-Russian Dictionary (1869), and 30 other Persian lexicographical translations through the 1950s.

In 2002, Professor Hassan Anvari published his Persian-to-Persian dictionary, ''Farhang-e Bozorg-e Sokhan'', in eight volumes by Sokhan Publications. 

Currently English-Persian dictionaries of [[Manouchehr Aryanpour]] and [[Soleiman Haim]] are widely used in Iran.

=== Sufi literature ===
[[Image:Asrar altawheed.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asrar al-Tawhid]] of [[Abusaeid Abolkheir]] is considered a significant work of Persian Sufi literature.]][[William Shakespeare]] referred to Iran as the "land of the Sophy".<ref>See William Shakespeare's ''[[The Twelfth Night]]''.</ref> Some of Persia's best-beloved medieval poets were [[Sufism|Sufis]], and their poetry was, and is, widely read by Sufis from [[Morocco]] to [[Indonesia]]. [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]] (Maul<U+0101>n<U+0101>) in particular is renowned both as a poet and as the founder of a widespread Sufi order. The themes and styles of this devotional poetry have been widely imitated by many Sufi poets. See also the article on [[Sufi poetry]].

Many notable texts in Persian mystic literature are not poems, yet highly read and regarded. Among those are ''[[Kimiya-yi sa'<U+0101>dat]]'' and ''[[Asrar al-Tawhid]]''.

=== Areas once under Ghaznavid or Mughal rule ===
==== Afghanistan and Central Asia====
[[Afghanistan]] and the [[Transoxiana]] can claim to be the birthplace of Modern Persian. Most of the great patrons of Persian literature such as [[Ahmed Sanjar|Sultan Sanjar]] and the courts of the [[Samanid Dynasty|Samanids]] and [[Ghaznavid Dynasty|Ghaznavids]] were situated in this region, as were writers such as [[Rudaki]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Ferdowsi]]. As such, this rich literary heritage continues to survive well into the present in countries like [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and Afghanistan.

==== India, Pakistan, and Kashmir ====
With the emergence of the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavid]]s and their successors such as the [[Ghurids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] and [[Mughal Empire]], [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and its literature gradually diffused into the vast [[Indian subcontinent]]. Persian was the language of the nobility, literary circles, and the royal Mughal courts for hundreds of years. (In modern times, Persian has been generally supplanted by [[Urdu]], a heavily Persian-influenced dialect of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].)

Under the Moghul Empire of India during the sixteenth century, the official language of India became Persian. Only in 1832 did the British army force the Indian subcontinent to begin conducting business in English. <small>''(Clawson, p.6)''</small> Persian poetry in fact flourished in these regions while post-[[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Iran]]ian literature stagnated. [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda|Dehkhoda]] and other scholars of the 20th century, for example, largely based their works on the detailed lexicography produced in India, using compilations such as [[Ghazi khan Badr Muhammad Dehlavi]]'s ''Adat al-Fudhala'' (<U+0627><U+062F><U+0627><U+0647> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0641><U+0636><U+0644><U+0627>), [[Ibrahim Ghavamuddin Farughi]]'s ''Farhang-i Ibrahimi'' (&nbsp;<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0627><U+0628><U+0631><U+0627><U+0647><U+06CC><U+0645><U+06CC>), and particularly Muhammad Padshah's  ''Farhang-i Anandraj'' (<U+0641><U+0631><U+0647><U+0646><U+06AF> <U+0622><U+0646><U+0627><U+0646><U+062F><U+0631><U+0627><U+062C>). Famous South Asian poets and scholars such as [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khosrow Dehlavi]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] of [[Lahore]] found many admirers in [[Iran]] itself.

=== Western literature ===
{{History of literature2}}
{{main|Persian literature in the West}}
Persian literature was little known in the West before the nineteenth century. It became much better known following the publication of several translations from the works of late medieval Persian poets, and it inspired works by various Western poets and writers.

==== German literature ====
* In 1819, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his ''West-<U+00F6>stlicher Divan'', a collection of lyric poems inspired by a German translation of [[Hafez|Hafiz]] (1326<U+2013>1390).
* The German essayist and philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] was the author of the book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' (1883<U+2013>1885),<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://faculty.frostburg.edu/phil/forum/Zarathustra.htm
|title=Nietzsche's Zarathustra
|work=Philosophical forum at Frostburg State University 
|accessdate=2006-03-31}}</ref> referring to the ancient Persian prophet [[Zoroaster]] (circa 1700 BCE).

==== English literature ====
* A selection from [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]] (935<U+2013>1020) was published in 1832 by [[James Atkinson]], a physician employed by the [[Honourable East India Company|British East India Company]].
* A portion of this abridgment was later versified by the British poet Matthew Arnold in his 1853 ''Rustam and Sohrab''.
* The American poet [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was another admirer of Persian poetry. He published several essays in 1876 that discuss Persian poetry:  ''Letters and Social Aims'', ''From the Persian of Hafiz'', and ''Ghaselle''.

Perhaps the most popular Persian poet of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m|Omar Khayyam]] (1048<U+2013>1123), whose ''[[Rubaiyat (Khayyam)|Rubaiyat]]'' was freely translated by [[Edward Fitzgerald]] in 1859. Khayyam is esteemed more as a scientist than a poet in his native Persia, but in Fitzgerald's rendering, he became one of the most quoted poets in English. Khayyam's line, "A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou", is known to many who could not say who wrote it, or where.

The Persian poet and mystic [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]] (1207<U+2013>1273) (known as Molana in Iran) has attracted a large following in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popularizing translations by [[Coleman Barks]] have presented Rumi as a [[New Age]] sage. There are also a number of more literary translations by scholars such as [[Arthur John Arberry|A.J. Arberry]].

The classical poets (Hafiz, [[Saadi|Sa'di]], Khayyam, Rumi, [[Nezami]] and [[Ferdowsi]]) are now widely known in English and can be read in various translations. Other works of Persian literature are untranslated and little known.

=== Swedish literature ===

During the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into [[Swedish language|Swedish]] by baron [[Eric Hermelin]]. He translated works by, among others, [[Farid al-Din Attar]], [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], [[Ferdowsi]], [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m|Omar Khayyam]], [[Saadi|Sa'adi]] and [[Sanai|Sana'i]]. Influenced by the writings of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], he was especially attracted to the religious or [[Sufism|Sufi]] aspects of classical Persian poetry. 

More recently Rumi, [[Hafiz]] and [[Fakhruddin 'Iraqi]] are available in translation by [[Ashk Dahl<U+00E9>n]], scholar in [[Iranian Studies]], who has made Persian literature known to a wider audience in [[Sweden]].

== Contemporary Persian literature ==
=== History ===
[[Image:Roshanfekran e Iran.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Some leading figures of Iranian literary intellectuals: (L to R) Morteza Keyvan, Ahmad Shamlou, Nima Yooshij, Siavash Kasraie, and Hushang Ebtehaj]]

In the nineteenth century, Persian literature experienced dramatic change and entered a new era. The beginning of this change was exemplified by an incident in the mid-nineteenth century at the court of [[Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar|Nasereddin Shah]], when the reform-minded prime minister, [[Amir Kabir]], chastised the poet [[Habibollah Qa'ani]] for "lying" in a panegyric qasida written in Kabir's honor. Kabir saw poetry in general and the type of poetry that had developed during the Qajar period as detrimental to "progress" and "modernization" in Iranian society, which he believed was in dire need of change. Such concerns were also expressed by others such as [[Fath-'Ali Akhundzadeh]], [[Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani]], and [[Mirza Malkom Khan]]. Khan also addressed a need for a change in Persian poetry in literary terms as well, always linking it to social concerns.

The new Persian literary movement cannot be understood without an understanding of the [[Intellectual movements in Iran|intellectual movements]] among Iranian philosophical circles. Given the social and political climate of Persia (Iran) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which led to the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Persian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1906<U+2013>1911, the idea that change in poetry was necessary became widespread. Many argued that Persian poetry should reflect the realities of a country in transition. This idea was propagated by notable literary figures such as [[Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda]] and [[Abolqasem Aref]], who challenged the traditional system of Persian poetry in terms of introducing new content and experimentation with rhetoric, lexico-semantics, and structure. Dehkhoda, for instance, used a lesser-known traditional form, the mosammat, to elegize the execution of a revolutionary journalist. 'Aref employed the ghazal, "the most central genre within the lyrical tradition" (p. 88), to write his "Payam-e Azadi" (Message of Freedom).

Some researchers argue that the notion of "sociopolitical ramifications of esthetic changes" led to the idea of poets "as social leaders trying the limits and possibilities of social change."<!--Quotation source?-->

An important movement in modern Persian literature centered on the question of [[modernization]] and [[Westernization]] and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It can be argued that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, 'Aref, Bahar, and Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.

[[Image:Abdolhossein-Zarrinkoub.jpg|thumb|right|[[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob|Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]], master of Persian literature and literary criticism]]

Following the pioneering works of [[Ahmad Kasravi]], [[Sadeq Hedayat]] and many others, the Iranian wave of comparative literature and literary criticism reached a symbolic crest with the emergence of [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob|Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]], [[Shahrokh Meskoob]], [[Houshang Golshiri]] and [[Ebrahim Golestan]].

===Persian literature in Afghanistan===
Persian literature in Afghanistan has also experienced a dramatic change during last century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Afghanistan was confronted with economic and social change, which sparked a new approach to literature. In 1911, [[Mahmud Tarzi]], who came back to Afghanistan after years of exile in Turkey and was influential in government circles, started a fortnightly publication named ''Saraj<U+2019>ul Akhbar''. ''Saraj'' was not the first such publication in the country, but in the field of journalism and literature it launched a new period of change and modernization. ''Saraj'' not only played an important role in journalism, it also gave new life to literature as a whole and opened the way for poetry to explore new avenues of expression through which personal thoughts took on a more social colour. 

In 1930 (1309 AH), after months of cultural stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle. A year later, another group calling itself the Kabul Literary Circle was founded in the capital. Both groups published regular magazines dedicated to culture and Persian literature. Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry and writing. In time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in Dari literature was pushed to the fringes of social and cultural life. 

Three of the most prominent classical poets in Afghanistan at the time were [[Ghary Abdullah]], [[Abdul Hagh Beytat]] and [[Khalilullah Khalili|Khalil Ullah Khalili]]. The first two received the honorary title ''Malek ul Shoara'' (King of Poets). Khalili, the third and youngest, was drawn toward the ''Khorasan style'' of poetry instead of the usual ''Hendi style''. He was also interested in modern poetry and wrote a few poems in a more modern style with new aspects of thought and meaning. In 1318 (AH)<!--Western date?-->, after two poems by [[Nima Youshij]] titled "Gharab" and "Ghaghnus" were published, Khalili wrote a poem under the name "Sorude Kuhestan" or "The Song of the Mountain" in the same rhyming pattern as Nima and sent it to the Kabul Literary Circle. The traditionalists in Kabul refused to publish it because it was not written in the traditional rhyme. They criticized Khalili for modernizing his style. 

Very gradually new styles found their way into literature and literary circles despite the efforts of traditionalists. The first book of new poems was published in the year 1957 (1336 AG), and in 1962 (1341 AH), a collection of modern Persian poetry was published in Kabul. The first group to write poems in the new style consisted of [[Mahmud Farani]], [[Baregh Shafi<U+2019>i]], [[Solyman Layegh]], [[Sohail]], [[Ayeneh]] and a few others. Later, [[Wasef Bakhtari|Vasef Bakhtari]], [[Asadullah Habib]] and [[Latif Nazemi]], and others joined the group. Each had his own share in modernizing Persian poetry in Afghanistan. Other notable figures include [[Ustad Behtab]], [[Leila Sarahat Roshani]], [[Sayed Elan Bahar]] and [[Parwin Pazwak]]. Poets like [[Mayakovsky]], [[Yase Nien]] and [[Lahouti]] (an Iranian poet living in exile in Russia) exerted a special influence on the Persian poets in Afghanistan. The influence of Iranians (e.g. [[Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi|Farrokhi Yazdi]] and [[Ahmad Shamlou]]) on modern Afghanistani prose and poetry, especially in the second half of the twentieth century, must also be taken into consideration.<ref>[http://www.qantara.de/uploads/540/FWF_78_Persian_Literature_in_Afghanistan.pdf Latif Nazemi ''"A Look at Persian Literature in Afghanistan"'']</ref>

Prominent Afghanistani writers like [[Asef Soltanzadeh]], [[Reza Ebrahimi, Ameneh Mohammadi]], and [[Abbas Jafari]] grew up in Iran and were influenced by Iranian writers and teachers. Although Afghanistani authors have not proven themselves in the international arena like Iranian writers,  Persian literature in Afghanistan has a promising future.<ref>[http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-236/0601185221175123.htm IRNA news Wednesday January 18, 2006]</ref>

===Persian literature in Tajikistan===
The new poetry in Tajikistan is mostly concerned with the way of life of people and is revolutionary. From the 1950s until the advent of new poetry in France, Asia and Latin America, the impact of the modernization drive was strong. In the 1960s, modern Iranian poetry and that of [[Mohammad Iqbal Lahouri]] made a profound impression in Tajik poetry. This period is probably the richest and most prolific period for the development of themes and forms in Persian poetry in Tajikistan. Some Tajik poets were mere imitators, and one can easily see the traits of foreign poets in their work. Only two or three poets were able to digest the foreign poetry and compose original poetry. In Tajikistan, the format and pictorial aspects of short stories and novels were taken from Russian and European literature. Some of [[Tajikistan]]'s prominent names in Persian literature are [[Gulrukhsor Safieva|Golrokhsar Safi Eva]],<ref>{{cite web

Contemporary Persian [[literary criticism]] reached its maturity after [[Sadeq Hedayat]], [[Ebrahim Golestan]], [[Houshang Golshiri]], [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoob|Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]] and [[Shahrokh Meskoob]]. Among these figures, Zarrinkoub held academic positions and had a reputation not only among the intelligentsia but also in academia. Besides his significant contribution to the maturity of Persian language and literature, Zarrinkoub boosted [[comparative literature]] and Persian literary criticism.<ref>[http://www.persian-language.org/Group/Article.asp?ID=582&P=4 AH Zarrinkoub: A biography]</ref> Zarrinkoub's ''Serr e Ney''  is a critical and comparative analysis of [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]]'s Masnavi. In turn, [[Shahrokh Meskoob]] worked on Ferdowsi<U+2019>s [[Shahnameh]], using the principles of modern literary criticism.

[[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Mohammad Taghi Bahar]]'s main contribution to this field is his book called ''Sabk Shenasi'' (Stylistics). It is a pioneering work on the practice of Persian literary historiography and the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the twentieth century. It contends that the exemplary status of Sabk-shinasi rests on the recognition of its disciplinary or institutional achievements. It further contends that, rather than a text on Persian <U+2018>stylistics<U+2019>, Sabk-shinasi is a vast history of Persian literary prose, and, as such, is a significant intervention in Persian literary historiography.<ref>[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(mm4rmseebl2r0myek21f4jj1)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,1,11;journal,3,12;linkingpublicationresults,1:105349,1]</ref>

=== Persian short stories ===
{{History of literature}}
Historically, the modern Persian short story has undergone three stages of development: a formative period, a period of consolidation and growth, and a period of diversity.<ref>[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/articles/persian_short_story.php Houra Yavari, ''"The Persian Short Story"'']</ref>

==== The formative period ====
The formative period was ushered in by [[Mohammad-Ali Jamalzadeh|Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh]]'s collection ''Yak-i Bud Yak-i Nabud'' (1921; tr. H. Moayyad and P. Sprachman as ''Once Upon a Time'', New York, 1985), and gained momentum with the early short stories of [[Sadeq Hedayat]] (1903<U+2013>51). Jamalzadeh (1895<U+2013>1997) is usually considered as the first writer of modern short stories in Persian. His stories focus on plot and action rather than on mood or character development and in that respect are reminiscent of the works of Guy de Maupassant and O. Henry.
In contrast, Sadeq Hedayat, the writer who introduced modernism to Persian literature, brought about a fundamental change in Persian fiction. In addition to his longer stories, "Bgf-e kur" (his masterpiece; see above ii.) and "Haji Aqa" (1945), he wrote collections of short stories including ''Seh Ghatra Khun'' (Three Drops of Blood, 1932; tr. into French by G. Lazard as ''Trois gouuttes de sang'', Paris 1996) and ''Zenda be Gur'' (Buried Alive, 1930). His stories were written in a simple and lucid language, but he employed a variety of approaches, from realism and naturalism to surrealistic fantasy, breaking new ground and introducing a whole range of literary models and presenting new possibilities for the further development of the genre. He experimented with disrupted chronology and non-linear or circular plots, applying these techniques to both his realistic and surrealist writings.
Unlike Hedayat, who focused on the psychological complexity and latent vulnerabilities of the individual, [[Bozorg Alavi]] depicts ideologically motivated personages defying oppression and social injustice. Such characters, seldom portrayed before in Persian fiction, are Alavi's main contribution to the thematic range of the modem Persian short story. This commitment to social issues is emulated by [[Fereydun Tonokaboni]] (b. 1937), [[Mahmud Dawlatabadi]] (b. 1940), [[Samad Behrangi]] (q.v.; 1939<U+2013>68), and other writers of the left in the next generation.

[[Sadeq Chubak]] was one of the first authors to break the taboo. Following the example of [[William Faulkner]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Erskine Caldwell]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]], his blunt approach appears in the early short story collections ''Khayma Shab-bazi'' (The Puppet Show, 1945) and ''Antar-i ke Luti-ash Morda Bud'' (1949; tr. P. Avery as "The Baboon Whose Buffoon was Dead", New World Writing 11, 1957, pp. 14-24), Later stories like "Zir-e Cheragh-e Ghermez", "Pirahan-e Zereski", and "Chera Darya Tufani Shoda Bud" describe the naked bestiality and moral degradation of the personages with no trace of squeamishness. His short stories mirror rotting society, populated by the crushed and the defeated. Chubak picks marginal characters<U+2014>vagrants, pigeon-racers, corpse-washers, prostitutes, and opium addicts<U+2014>who rarely appear in the fiction of his predecessors, and whom he portrays with vividness and force. His readers come face to face with grim realities and incidents that they have often witnessed for themselves in everyday life but have shunned out of their mind through complacency.

A distinctive trait of post-war Persian fiction in all the three stages of development is the attention devoted to narrative styles and techniques. In matters of style two main trends prevail. Some authors, like Chubak and Al-e Ahmad, follow colloquial speech patterns; others, such as [[Ebrahim Golestan]] (b. 1922) and [[Mohammad Etemadzadeh]] "Behazin" (b. 1915), have adopted a more literary and lyrical tone. Although the work of all four writers stretch into later periods, some brief remarks about their differing techniques, which delineated future paths, need mentioning at the outset. Golestan experimented with different narrative styles, and it was only in two late collections of stories, ''Juy o Divar o Teshna'' (The Stream and the Wall and the Parched, 1967) and ''Madd o Meh'' (The Tide and the Mist, 1969) that he managed to find a style and voice of his own. His poetic language draws inspiration both from syntactical forms of classical Persian prose and the experiments of modernist writers, most notably Gertrude Stein. The influence of modernism is evident also in the structure of Golestan's short stories, in which the traditional linear plot line is abandoned in favor of disrupted chronology and free association of ideas. Contrary to most other modern Persian authors, Golestan pays little heed to the state of the poor and the dispossessed. Instead, his short stories are devoted to the world of Persian intellectuals, their concerns, anxieties and private obsessions. His short stories resemble well-made decorative objects d'art, pleasing perhaps to the cognoscenti but leaving the majority of readers unmoved. Golestan's brand of modernism has influenced the later generation of writers like [[Bahman Forsi]] (b. 1933) and [[Hooshang Golshiri]] (b. 1937). Although the stories of Behazin show similar indebtedness to classical Persian models, he does not follow Golestan's modernist experiments with syntax. Behazin is an author whose stories, delivered in a lucid literary style, express his leftist social beliefs. In some of his later works like the short story collection ''Mohra-ye Mar'' (The Snake Charm, 1955), he turns to literary allegory, imbuing ancient tales with a new message, a technique, which allows him to express his critical views obliquely. Behazin's predecessors in the sub-genre of the allegorical tale were Hedayat (in ''Ab-e Zendegi'', 1931) and Chubak ("Esa'a-ye Adab" in the collection ''Khayma-Shab-Bazi'').

==== Period of growth and development ====
This second period in the development of the modern Persian short story began with the [[Mohammed Mosaddeq#Operation Ajax|coup]] of [[19 August]] [[1953]], and ended with the [[Iranian revolution|revolution of 1979]].
[[Image:Sales Moshiri.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mehdi Akhavan Sales]] and [[Fereydoon Moshiri]], modern Persian poets]]
[[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad|Jalal Al-e Ahmad]] is among the proponents of new political and cultural ideas whose influence and impact straddle the first and the second periods in the history of modern Persian fiction. His writings show an awareness of the works of Franz Fanon and the new generation of third-world writers concerned with the problems of cultural domination by colonial powers. Al-e Ahmad, Behazin, Tonekaboni, and Behrangi can all be described as engaged writers because most of their stories are built around a central ideological tenet or thesis and illustrate the authors' political views and leanings. Among poets of this period, [[Forough Farrokhzad]] (1935<U+2013>1967) has a special place as the first female poet of the Persian language acclaimed by her contemporaries and who left a lasting legacy despite her short life. Her legacy and influence is not primarily (or uniquely) political; however, she was among the first women able to set a personal and original mark. In this sense she is elevated to iconic status. 

Another notable author from this period is [[Simin Daneshvar]] (b. 1921), the first woman writer of note in contemporary Persian literature. Her reputation rests largely on her popular novel ''Savusun'' (1969). Simin Daneshvar's short stories deserve mention because they focus on the plight and social exclusion of women in Persian society and address topical issues from a woman's point of view.

[[Gholam Hossein Saedi]]'s (1935<U+2013>85) short stories, which he called ''ghessa'', often transcend the boundaries of realism and attain a symbolic significance. His allegorical stories, which occasionally resemble folkloric tales and fables, are inhabited by displaced persons, trapped in dead ends (Sepanlu, p. 117). They emphasize the anxieties and the psychological perturbations of his deeply troubled characters. Sadeghi (1936<U+2013>84) was yet another author who focused on the anxieties and secret mental agonies of his characters.

Hooshang Golshiri (b. 1937) and [[Asghar Elahi]] (b. 1944) created memorable psychological portraits through interim monologue and stream of consciousness techniques. Golshiri, the author of the long story "Shazda Ehtejab" (Prince Ehtejab, 1968), is particularly noted for his successful experiments with extended interior monologues. A bold, innovative writer eager to explore modern methods and styles, Golshiri uses stream of consciousness narrative to reassess familiar theories and events.

==== Period of diversity ====

=== Poetry ===

Of the hundreds of contemporary Persian poets (classical and modern), notable figures include [http://www.sharghnewspaper.com/850407/html/v2.htm] [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]], [[Simin Behbahani]], [[Forough Farrokhzad]], [[Bijan Jalali]], [[Siavash Kasraie]], [[Fereydoon Moshiri]], [[Nader Naderpour]], [[Sohrab Sepehri]], [[Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani]], [[Ahmad Shamlou]], [[Nima Yooshij|Nima Yushij]], [[Manouchehr Atashi]], [[Hushang Ebtehaj|Houshang Ebtehaj]], [[Mirzadeh Eshghi]] (classical), [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar|Mohammad Taghi Bahar]] (classical), [[Aref]] (classical), [[Parvin E'tesami|Parvin Etesami]] (classical), and [[Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar|Shahriar]] (classical).
[[Image:Nima Youshij.jpg|frame|[[Nima Yushij]], founder of modern Persian poetry]]

==== Classical Persian poetry in modern times ====
A few notable classical poets have arisen since the nineteenth century, among whom Mohammad Taghi Bahar and Parvin Etesami have been most celebrated. Mohammad Taghi Bahar had the title "king of poets" and had a significant role in the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the twentieth century.<ref>[http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/(mm4rmseebl2r0myek21f4jj1)/app/home/contribution.asp?referrer=parent&backto=issue,1,11;journal,3,12;linkingpublicationresults,1:105349,1 Wali Ahmadi ''"The institution of Persian literature and the genealogy of Bahar's stylistics"'']</ref> The theme of his poems was the social and political situation of Iran. 

Parvin Etesami may be called the greatest Persian poetess writing in the classical style. One of her remarkable series, called ''Mast va Hoshyar'' (The Drunk and the Sober), won admiration from many of those involved in romantic poetry.<ref>[http://www.irib.ir/occasions/etesami/etesamiEn.htm Parvin Etesami's biography at IRIB.com]</ref>

==== Modern Persian poetry ====
[[Nima Yooshij|Nima Yushij]] is considered the father of modern Persian poetry, introducing many techniques and forms to differentiate the modern from the old. Nevertheless, the credit for popularizing this new literary form within a country and culture solidly based on a thousand years of classical poetry goes to his few disciples such as Ahmad Shamlou, who adopted Nima's methods and tried new techniques of modern poetry.

The transformation brought about by Nima Youshij, who freed Persian poetry from the fetters of prosodic measures, was a turning point in a long literary tradition. It broadened the perception and thinking of the poets that came after him. Nima offered a different understanding of the principles of classical poetry. His artistry was not confined to removing the need for a fixed-length hemistich and dispensing with the tradition of rhyming but focused on a broader structure and function based on a contemporary understanding of human and social existence. His aim in renovating poetry was to commit it to a "natural identity" and to achieve a modern discipline in the mind and linguistic performance of the poet.<ref name="Mansur Khaksar">[http://www.iran-bulletin.org/art/Shamlu_khaksar.html Mansur Khaksar ''"Shamlu<U+2019>s poetic world"'']</ref>

Nima held that the formal technique dominating classical poetry interfered with its vitality, vigor and progress. Although he accepted some of its aesthetic properties and extended them in his poetry, he never ceased to widen his poetic experience by emphasizing the "natural order" of this art. What Nima Youshij founded in contemporary poetry, his successor [[Ahmad Shamlou]] continued.

The [[Sepid Persian Poetry|Sepid poem]] (which translates to white poem), which draws its sources from this poet, avoided the compulsory rules which had entered the Nimai<U+2019> school of poetry and adopted a freer structure. This allowed a more direct relationship between the poet and his or her emotional roots. In previous poetry, the qualities of the poet<U+2019>s vision as well as the span of the subject could only be expressed in general terms and were subsumed by the formal limitations imposed on poetic expression.
[[Image:Pic-khalili.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Khalilollah Khalili]] on the cover of "Deewaan-e Khalilullah Khalili"]]
[[Image:Simin_Daneshvar.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Simin Daneshvar]], Iran's first female novelist and short story writer.]]
Nima<U+2019>s poetry transgressed these limitations. It relied on the natural function inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet<U+2019>s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai<U+2019> poetry is to move away from the rhythms it employed. Nima Yioushij paid attention to an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.<ref name="Mansur Khaksar" />

Ahmad Shamlu discovered the inner characteristics of poetry and its manifestation in the literary creations of classical masters as well as the Nimai<U+2019> experience. He offered an individual approach. By distancing himself from the obligations imposed by older poetry and some of the limitations that had entered the Nimai<U+2019> poem, he recognized the role of prose and music hidden in the language. In the structure of Sepid poetry, in contrast to the prosodic and Nimai<U+2019> rules, the poem is written in more "natural" words and incorporates a prose-like process without losing its poetic distinction.
Sepid poetry is a developing branch of Nimai<U+2019> poetry built upon Nima Youshij's innovations. Nima thought that any change in the construction and the tools of a poet<U+2019>s expression is conditional on his/her knowledge of the world and a revolutionized outlook. Sepid poetry could not take root outside this teaching and its application. 

According to [[Simin Behbahani]], Sepid poetry did not received general acceptance before [[Bijan Jalali]]'s works. He is considered the founder of Sepid poetry according to Behbahani.<ref>{{cite web

Behbahani herself used the "Char Pareh" style of Nima, and subsequently turned to [[ghazal]], a free-flowing poetry style similar to the Western sonnet. Simin Behbahani contributed to a historic development in the form of the ghazal, as she added theatrical subjects, and daily events and conversations into her poetry. She has expanded the range of traditional Persian verse forms and produced some of the most significant works of Persian literature in the twentieth century.

A reluctant follower of Nima Yushij, [[Mehdi Akhavan-Sales]] published his ''Organ'' (1951) to support contentions against Nima Yushij's groundbreaking endeavors. But before long he realized that Nima and the modernists emulating him had more to offer than a just a change in rhythm, rhyme, and the general application of the classical Arabic meters.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Poets/Inscription.html Iraj Bashiri ''"A Brief Note on the Life of Mehdi Akhavan Sales"'']</ref> In Persian poetry, Mehdi Akhavan Sales has established a bridge between the ''Khorassani'' and ''Nima'' Schools. The critics consider Mehdi Akhavan Sales as one of the best contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of free verse (new style poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics. It was his ambition, for a long time, to introduce a fresh style to Persian poetry.<ref>[http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/makhavansales/mehdi_akhavan_sales.php Mehdi Akhavan Sales's biography at Iranchamber.com]</ref>

[[Forough Farrokhzad]] is important in the literary history of Iran for three reasons. First, she was among the first generation to embrace the new style of poetry, pioneered by Nima Yushij during the 1920s, which demanded that poets experiment with rhyme, imagery, and the individual voice. Second, she was the first modern Iranian woman to graphically articulate private sexual landscapes from a woman's perspective. Finally, she transcended her own literary role and experimented with acting, painting, and documentary film-making.<ref>[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/emes/sourcebook/da.data/82637/FileSource/1957_farrokhzad.pdf Forough Farrokhzad and modern Persian poetry]</ref>

[[Fereydoon Moshiri]] is best known as conciliator of classical Persian poetry with the New Poetry initiated by Nima Yooshij. One of the major contributions of Moshiri's poetry, according to some observers, is the broadening of the social and geographical scope of modern Persian literature.<ref>[http://www.fereydoonmoshiri.org/fmepage01.htm Fereydoon Moshiri's official website]</ref>

A poet of the last generation before the Islamic Revolution worthy of mention is [[Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani]] (M. Sereshk). Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafez and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere. He is the most successful of those poets who in the past four decades have tried hard to find a synthesis between the two models of Ahmad Shamloo and Nima Youshij.<ref>[http://www.art-arena.com/book.htm#Nader_Naderpour Mahmud Kianush, ''"A Summary of the Introduction to Modern Persian Poetry"'']</ref>

Abdul Halim Shayek, whose pen name is Pendar, was born in Herat, Afghanistan, in 1938 and died in San Jose, California, USA, in 2005. His poems are available at http://www.shayekpendar.com.
