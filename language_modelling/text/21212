'''Mammotrectus super Bibliam''' (''nourisher on the Bible'') of Johannes Marchesinus, is a guide to understanding the text of the [[Bible]], it is one of the most important [[Franciscan]] school texts of the later Middle Ages. It was written for use by clerics.

The Mammotrectus was written by Johannes Marchesinus, Franciscan, at [[Reggio Emilia|Regio]], near [[Modena]] at the end of the 13th century. It was the most important work of Marchesinus. Marchesinus based its work mainly on ''Expositiones vocabulorum biblie'', of Franciscan William of Brito (written between 1250 and 1270).<ref name = textmanuscripts>[http://www.textmanuscripts.com/manuscript_description.php?id=2825&%20cat=p3&# Textmanuscripts]</ref><ref name = Berger>Samuel Berger, [http://godieu.com/doc/samuelberger/la_bible_16e_siecle.html#Chapitre2 ''La Bible au XVIe si<U+00E8>cle''], Paris, 1879, pp. 15-28.</ref>

The Mammotrectus contains about 1300 articles and it is divided into three parts: 1) explanations for difficult biblical words and passages; 2) a series of digressions on orthography, the accents of Latin words, the seven feasts of the Old Testament Law, the clothing of priests, the principles of exegesis and translation, the names of God, the qualities and properties of Scripture, and a treatise on the four main [[ecumenical councils]]; 3) liturgical pieces and some related materials (the hymns, legends of saints, sermons and homilies).<ref name = Berger/><ref name = textmanuscripts/><ref>[http://users.bart.nl/~roestb/franciscan/franautm.htm#_Toc409561347 FRANAUT-M]</ref> The author was aware that his book is imperfect and he wrote in Preface: "Let any imperfections in the book, be attributed to me: and if there is anything good, let it be thought to have come from God."<ref>P.

The first printed edition was published in 1470, in Mainz, by [[Peter Sch<U+00F6>ffer]].<ref> Magne Saebo, [http://books.google.pl/books?id=OMlT-FViF40C&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Hebrew Bible / Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation: from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment''], Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2008, p. 99. </ref> It was popular in the 15th century, but its popularity fall in the 16th century. Henri Bebel criticised it in 1508 (''Commentaria deabusione linguae latinae apud Germanos'', Pfortzheim).<ref name = Berger/> [[Desiderius Erasmus]] in 1515 in one of the symposiums ''Synodus grammaticorum'' had criticised those priests who still read the ''Mammotrectus''.<ref>[http://smu.edu/bridwell_tools/specialcollections/schoeffer/mammotrectus.htm PETER SCHOEFFER : PRINTER OF MAINZ]</ref> It was criticised by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rabelais]] (in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'') and [[Martin Luther]] (1524).<ref name = Berger/> Protestants completely rejected this work. The work was very quickly forgotten, even the title was confused <U+2013> Mammotrectus, Mammetractus, or Mammothreptus.<ref>P. S.

Samuel Berger listed in 1879 fifteen manuscripts of the Mammotrectus, all in continental European libraries.<ref name = Berger/> Some other manuscripts were identified in the 20th century. Most of the early printed editions of the Mammotrectus are different from the earliest manuscripts. The new critical edition of the work should be prepared.<ref name = textmanuscripts/>
