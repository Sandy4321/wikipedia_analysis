"'''At My Most Beautiful'''" is a song by the American [[alternative rock]] band [[R.E.M.]] During the song's creation, members of the group noted its similarity to the work of [[the Beach Boys]] and purposefully fashioned it to resemble that band's output. Singer [[Michael Stipe]] strove to make his lyrics the most romantic he had ever written, and the piano-driven ballad became R.E.M.'s first straightforward love song. Released on the group's 1998 album ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'', it was issued as the third single from that record the following year, reaching number 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Origin and recording==
R.E.M. bassist [[Mike Mills]] stated that after he composed the piano part to "At My Most Beautiful", he felt it sounded like music the [[Beach Boys]]' [[Brian Wilson]] would have written two decades prior.<ref name="Forman">Forman, Bill. "Diminished But Unafraid, R.E.M. Talk About the Passion". ''Pulse!''. November 1998.</ref> Once guitarist [[Peter Buck]] received the basic tracks of the song from Mills, he too found the music reminiscent of Wilson.<ref name="Sprague">Sprague, David. "Buck on Up". ''Guitar Magazine''. December 1998.</ref> Instead of avoiding the comparisons, the group instead opted to "[run] toward it", in Mills' words.<ref name="Forman" />

The lyrics for the song originated when singer [[Michael Stipe]] was stuck in traffic on [[Los Angeles]]' [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. Listening to the music, he came came up with the line "I found a way to make you smile". Stipe later recalled, "I just thought, that's the most beautiful thing in the world." The music also reminded him of the Beach Boys, whom his bandmates were fans of, particularly the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album, and he associated the line he created with that group's ''[[The Smile Sessions|Smile]]'' project. Though not familiar with the Beach Boys' output himself, Stipe proceeded to write a song "that's so Beach Boys" as a gift to his bandmates.<ref name="Sakamoto">Sakamoto, John. "Michael Stipe Talks Shop". ''Jam! Magazine''. October 18, 1998.</ref>

Stipe had difficultly writing lyrics for the ''Up'' album.<ref name="Sakamoto" /> In the case of "At My Most Beautiful", it took the singer a year to write the song's verse because he needed to figure out what one could do to prompt the action described in the opening line. The solution finally occurred to him one morning, and he finished writing the words in 45 minutes.<ref name="Black237">Black, p. 237</ref> After a conversation with [[Patti Smith]], Stipe was convinced that he needed to be fearless in his songwriting approach. In regards to "At My Most Beautiful", he had grown tired writing ironic love songs and consequently endeavored to create "the most romantic song I'd ever written".<ref name="Sakamoto" />
[[File:Hal Blaine in 2008.jpg|alt=Blaine sitting behind a large drum set giving a thumbs up|thumb|"At My Most Beautiful" was written as a pop ballad in the style of 1960s musicians such as Brian Wilson and Hal Blaine (pictured)]]
Following the departure of drummer and founding member [[Bill Berry]], the dynamic of the band changed. Buck performed drums on the song; though he admitted he was not adept at playing the instrument, he stated his skill level was sufficient to perform what he referred to as the "[[Hal Blaine]]-ish" fills heard on the recording.<ref name="Sprague" /> During the final stages of production for ''Up'' in 1998, two days<U+2014>June 21 and 22<U+2014>were used to perform [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] on the song.<ref name="Black237" />

==Composition and lyrics==
"At My Most Beautiful" is performed in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[F major]]. There are several main chord progressions in the song: the introduction is Fmaj7<U+2013>D<U+2013>G minor, while the verse follows a I<U+2013>III<U+2013>IV<U+2013>II chord sequence and the chorus ascends using a II<U+2013>III<U+2013>IV<U+2013>V progression. In the mix, [[tubular bells|tubular]] and [[Jingle bell|sleigh bells]] are heard in the right channel (with their [[reverberation]] reaching into the left), piano and bass guitar (both played in [[quarter note]] patterns) as well as bass harmonica are heard in the left, and guitar and Mike Mills' backing vocals are centered. Additional instrumentation includes organ in the chorus and cellos in the song's [[coda (music)|coda]]. The notes Michael Stipe sings are typical of the vocalist, focusing on the first, third, and fourth notes of the scale he's performing.<ref name="Rooksby157">Rooksby, p. 157</ref>

Commenting on the song's musical similarities to the work of the Beach Boys in his book ''Inside Classic Rock Tracks'', Rikki Rooksby wrote that "At My Most Beautiful" was "a tribute to that sound, at once conveying something of R.E.M. ''and'' Brian Wilson. In other words, it's not so much like The Beach Boys that it's a pastiche, but sufficiently like them to be a musical homage."<ref>Rooksby, p. 156</ref> He states that the song's use of an F chord with an A bass note in the verse follows the example of Brian Wilson's use of [[Inversion (music)|inversion]]s on his band's ''Pet Sounds'' album, and that the cellos at the end heightens the section's resemblance to the Beach Boys' "[[Good Vibrations]]".<ref name="Rooksby157" />

In addition to being its first tribute song, "At My Most Beautiful" was also R.E.M.'s first straightforward love song.<ref>Buckley, p. 290</ref> The lyrics reference leaving messages on a love interest's answering machine and what Rooksby terms "knowing obsession". He states that the song is about "the ennobling effect of love, yet is aware of its playful narcissism".<ref name="Rooksby157" />

==Release and promotion==
"At My Most Beautiful" was released as the third single from ''Up'' in early 1999.<ref>Fletcher, p. 335</ref> That February, R.E.M. performed "At My Most Beautiful" for an episode of ''[[Party of Five]]'', a television series which had included music by the band in the past; the show's producers determined the choice of song to be featured in the program.<ref>Van Horn, Terri. "[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/512237/rem-tv-taping-turns-into-gig.jhtml R.E.M. Follow TV Taping With Intimate Gig]". MTV.com. February 18, 1999. Retrieved on January 23, 2013.</ref> The single's promotional [[music video|video]] was directed by [[Nigel Dick]].<ref>"[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433473/rem-party-cameo-tv-role.jhtml R.E.M.

Retrieved on January 23, 2013.</ref> The clip follows a [[cellist]] (portrayed by [[Rain Phoenix]]) experiencing a "bad day" on her way to an audition overseen by Buck, Mills, and Stipe. R.E.M. biographer David Buckley praised the narrative promo as one of the band's best.<ref>Buckley, p. 291</ref> Though the song was a moderate hit, its success failed to stimulate sales of ''Up'', which by 1999 had sold a relatively low three million copies worldwide.<ref>Doyle, Tom.
