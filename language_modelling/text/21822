The '''Celier Kiss''' is a series of [[Poland|Polish]] [[autogyro]]s that was designed by Frenchman Raphael Celier and produced by his company, [[Celier Aviation]] of [[Jaktor<U+00F3>w-Kolonia]], Poland. The aircraft is supplied as a kit for [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur construction]] or as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.<ref name="WDLA11">Bayerl, Robby; Martin Berkemeier; et al: ''World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2011-12'', page 178. WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X</ref>

==Design and development==
The [[Tandem|tandem seat]] Kiss series was designed as a complement to the [[side-by-side configuration]] [[Celier Xenon 2]] series of autogyros. The Kiss series all feature a single main rotor, [[tricycle landing gear]], a low-set [[T-tail]] and a choice of engines, all mounted in [[pusher configuration]].<ref name="WDLA11" />

==Variants==
;Kiss 582
:A proposed single seat variant under development in 2011. It will be powered by the twin cylinder, liquid-cooled, [[two-stroke]], dual-ignition {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]] engine. The cockpit will be either partially or, optionally, fully-enclosed.<ref name="WDLA11" />
;Kiss 912
:Base model, with two seats in tandem, powered by a four cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, [[four-stroke]], dual-ignition {{convert|80|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 912UL]] engine in pusher configuration. The cockpit has a semi-enclosed [[Aircraft fairing|fairing]] with a windshield.<ref name="WDLA11" />
;Kiss 912S
:Upgraded model, with two seats in tandem, powered by a four cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four-stroke, dual-ignition {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 912ULS]] engine in pusher configuration. The cockpit has a fully-enclosed fairing.<ref name="WDLA11" />
;Kiss 914
:[[Turbocharged]] model, with two seats in tandem, powered by a four cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four-stroke, dual-ignition {{convert|115|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 914]] engine in pusher configuration. The cockpit has a fully-enclosed fairing.<ref name="WDLA11" />
