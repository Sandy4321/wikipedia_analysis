{{History of Spain}}

The '''Siege of Ja<U+00E9>n''' was one of many sieges on the city during the long [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Reconquista]]. The siege, which was carried out by the combined allied forces of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Taifa of Baeza]], commanded by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] and [[Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al-Bayyasi]] of Baeza against the defending [[Taifa of Jayy<U+0101>n]] (<U+062C><U+064A><U+0627><U+0646>) whose forces were commanded by the notable Christian knight, [[<U+00C1>lvaro P<U+00E9>rez de Castro (d. 1240)|<U+00C1>lvaro P<U+00E9>rez de Castro]]. The battle arguably resulted in a Jayy<U+0101>nese victory as the Castilian forces did not capture the city. Areas around the city were totally devastated as a result of the siege. The siege occurred as a part of Ferdinand III's first campaign which occurred roughly from 1224 to 1230 and was undertaken before the [[Siege of And<U+00FA>jar]] that same year. 

== Context ==

The taking of Ja<U+00E9>n was perceived as being fundamental to let [[Kingdom of Castile]] expand into the [[Baetic Depression]]. The difficulty in this conquest were the notable [[:es:Murallas de Ja<U+00E9>n|Walls of Ja<U+00E9>n]] which had been built by the [[Almohad Caliphate]]. They had been instrumental in repulsing an attack on the city by [[Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile]] from 1151 to 1152, and another attack by the Almohads in 1162.

Taking this into account, in 1224, Ferdinand III of Castile attacked the surrounding lands in what today is the province of Ja<U+00E9>n, establishing their base of operations at Baeza with their Muslim ally, [[Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al-Bayyasi]], the king of the [[Taifa of Baeza]]. This first campaign was essentially a probe to test the defenses of Ja<U+00E9>n.

== The Siege ==

The strong Castilian army accompanied King [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. On its march to Ja<U+00E9>n, it was joined by Ferdinand III's vassal, the King of the [[Taifa of Baeza]], [[Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al-Bayyasi]] and his forces. Ferdinand III's army approached the city with the intention of probing its defenses to find if it could be captured. 

During the siege, besieging Castilian camps were established in all the areas around Ja<U+00E9>n, encircling the city completely. The soldiers in these camps were instructed to carry out a campaign of attrition on the surrounding countryside which they effectively plundered of all its resources, destroying any buildings. 

The major action of this siege occurred during one instance of such raids, which provoked defending troops of Ja<U+00E9>n to raid the camps. The Castilians responded by assaulting the city walls in a failed attack.

The siege was lifted shortly after this was realized, and the Castilian army [[Siege of And<U+00FA>jar|moved instead on And<U+00FA>jar]] which they captured later in the same year, 1225.

== Consequences ==

The siege by Castilian forces failed to take over the city, as the Castilian army did not have the siege equipment necessary to mount a prolonged siege. The [[Cr<U+00F3>nica de <U+00C1>vila]], a contemporary source, does however recount the use of [[trebuchet]]s at the battle. The defense of Ja<U+00E9>n was led by 160 Christian knights who supported the Muslim defenders under the command of the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] [[magnate]], [[<U+00C1>lvaro P<U+00E9>rez de Castro (d. 1240)|<U+00C1>lvaro P<U+00E9>rez de Castro el Castellano]], head of the [[House of Castro]] and grandson of [[Alfonso VII of Le<U+00F3>n and Castile]], the [[List of Castilian monarchs|king of Castile and Le<U+00F3>n]]. According to the Christian chronicles, 3,000 knights and 50,000 foot soldiers defended the city in addition to the 160 Christian knights under Castro.
