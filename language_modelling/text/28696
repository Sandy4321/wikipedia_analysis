The '''''Harvard Review''''' is a literary magazine published by the [[Harvard University]] library system. 

Its origins can be dated to 1986, when [[Stratis Haviaras]], the curator of the libraries' poetry room founded a magazine called ''Erato'' to publicize poetry room authors.

The first issue included a poem by [[Seamus Heaney]] and several book reviews. Soon, the publication was rechristened the ''Harvard Book Review'' and grew substantially in size. In 1992, the Haviaras incorporated that magazine as part of the ''Harvard Review'', a semi-annually published volume of several hundred pages. 

Among the authors that have appeared in the magazine are [[Arthur Miller]], [[Alice Hoffman]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Gore Vidal]], [[David Mamet]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[John Ashbery]], [[Jorie Graham]], [[Jim Crace]], [[John Updike]], and [[Thomas McGuane]].
