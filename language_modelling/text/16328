The island had become part of the Gaelic Kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] during the [[Scotland in the Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] before being absorbed into the Norse [[Kingdom of the Isles]]. The later [[medieval]] period marked a "cultural high point" with the transfer of the [[Hebrides]] to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the emergence of the [[Clan Donald]] [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]], originally centred at [[Finlaggan]].<ref>Caldwell (2011) p. 58</ref> During the 17th century the Clan Donald star waned, but improvements to agriculture and transport led to a rising population, which peaked in the mid-19th century.<ref name="HSmith41"/> This was followed by substantial [[Highland Clearances|forced displacements]] and declining resident numbers. 

Today, it has over three thousand inhabitants and the main commercial activities are agriculture, [[Islay whisky|malt whisky distillation]] and tourism.

Islay is home to many bird species such as the wintering populations of [[Greater White-fronted Goose|Greenland White-fronted]] and [[Barnacle Goose]], and is a popular destination throughout the year for birdwatchers. The climate is mild and ameliorated by the [[Gulf Stream]].

==Geography==
[[File:Islay topographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map]]
Islay is {{convert|40|km|mi}} long from north to south and some {{convert|24|km|mi}} broad. The east coast is rugged and mountainous, rising steeply from the [[Sound of Islay]], the highest peak being [[Beinn Bheigier]], which is a [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]] at 1,612 feet (491 m). The western peninsulas are separated from the main bulk of the island by the waters of [[Loch Indaal]] to the south and [[Loch Gruinart]] to the north.<ref>Murray (1966) pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref> The fertile and windswept south western arm is called [[Rinns of Islay|The Rinns]], and [[Ardnave Point]] is a conspicuous promontory on the northwest coast.  The south coast is sheltered from the prevailing winds and, as a result, relatively wooded.<ref>Murray (1966) p. 32</ref><ref>Newton (1995) p. 42</ref><ref name=OS/> The [[fractal]] coast has numerous bays  and sea lochs, including [[Loch an t-Sailein]], [[Aros Bay]] and [[Claggain Bay]].<ref name=OS/> In the far south-west is a rocky and now largely uninhabited peninsula called [[The Oa]], the closest point in the Hebrides to [[Ireland]].<ref>Murray (1966) p. 30</ref>

The island's population is mainly centred around the villages of [[Bowmore]] and [[Port Ellen]]. Other smaller villages include [[Bridgend, Islay|Bridgend]], [[Ballygrant]], [[Port Charlotte, Islay|Port Charlotte]], [[Portnahaven]] and [[Port Askaig]]. The rest of the island is sparsely populated and mainly agricultural.<ref name=Caldwellxxv>Caldwell (2011) p. xxv</ref> There are several small freshwater [[loch]]s in the interior including [[Finlaggan|Loch Finlaggan]], Loch Ballygrant, Loch Lossit and Loch Gorm and numerous [[Stream|burns]] throughout the island, many of which bear the name "river" despite their small size. The most significant of these are the [[River Laggan, Islay|River Laggan]] which discharges into the sea at the north end of Laggan Bay and the [[River Sorn]] which, draining Loch Finlaggan, enters the head of Loch Indaal at Bridgend.<ref name=OS/>

There are numerous small uninhabited islands around the coasts, the largest of which are [[Eilean Mhic Coinnich]] and [[Orsay, Inner Hebrides|Orsay]] off the Rinns, [[Nave Island]] on the north west coast, [[Claig Castle|Am Fraoch Eilean]] in the Sound of Islay and [[Texa]] off the south coast.<ref name=OS/>

==Prehistory==
[[File:Dun Nosebridge.jpg|thumb|[[Dun Nosebridge]] from the south]]
The earliest settlers on Islay were nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s who may have first arrived during the [[Mesolithic period]] after the retreat of the [[Pleistocene]] ice caps. A flint [[arrowhead]], which was found in a field near [[Bridgend, Islay|Bridgend]] in 1993 and dates from 10,800 BC, is amongst the earliest evidence of a human presence found so far in Scotland.<ref>Mithen (2006) pp. 197<U+2013>98</ref>{{#tag:ref|At the time this [[Ahrensburg culture|Ahrensburgian]] flint was the oldest find in Scotland<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 42</ref> but a subsequent discovery at [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] predates it by over a millennium.<ref>[http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/howburn-farm-excavating-scotlands-first-people.htm "Howburn Farm: Excavating Scotland<U+2019>s first people"] Current Archaeology.

The most spectacular prehistoric structure on the island is [[Dun Nosebridge]]. This {{convert|375|m2|sqft}} [[Iron Age]] fort occupies a prominent crag and has commanding views of the surrounding landscape. The name's origin is probably a mixture of Gaelic and Old Norse: ''Dun'' in the former language means "fort" and ''knaus-borg'' in the latter means "fort on the crag".<ref>Newton (1995) p. 26</ref> There is no evidence that Islay was ever subject to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] military control although small numbers of finds such as a coin and a brooch from the third century AD suggest links of some kind with the intermittent [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman presence]] on the mainland.<ref>Caldwell (2011) p. 17</ref> The ruins of a [[broch]] at D<U+00F9>n Bhoraraic south east of Ballygrant and the remains of numerous [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s indicate the influences of northern Scotland, where these forms of building originate.<ref name=Caldwell19/><ref>Armit, Ian "The Iron Age" in Omand (2006) pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref> There are also various [[crannog]]s on Islay, including sites in Loch Ardnave, Loch Ballygrant and Loch Allallaidh in the south east where a stone causeway leading out to two adjacent islands is visible beneath the surface of the water.<ref name=OS/><ref name=Caldwell19>Caldwell (2011) pp. 137<U+2013>38</ref>

There is some controversy about the nature of the relationship between the indigenous peoples of Ireland and south west Scotland during the late Iron Age. The widely accepted theory is that the latter became populated by immigrants from the former, replacing an earlier culture, although it has also been suggested that the Gaels in this part of Scotland were [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to the area.<ref>Woolf (2012) p. 1</ref>

==History==
[[File:Port nan Gallan, on the Mull of Oa, Isle of Islay - geograph.org.uk - 92883.jpg|thumb|left|Port nan Gallan, [[The Oa]], with [[Kintyre]], mainland Scotland, in the far distance]]

===Dalriada===
By the 6th century AD Islay, along with much of mainland Argyll, lay within the Gaelic kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] with strong links to Ireland and, according to the  ''[[Senchus fer n-Alban]]'' ("The History of the Men of Scotland"), was ruled by the kin group [[Cen<U+00E9>l n<U+00D3>engusa]]. In 627 the son of a king of the Irish [[U<U+00ED> Echach Cobo|U<U+00ED> Ch<U+00F3>elbad]], a branch of the [[D<U+00E1>l nAraidi]] kingdom of Ulster, was killed on Islay at the unidentified location of Ard-Corann by a warrior in an army led by King [[Connad Cerr]] of the [[Corcu R<U+00E9>ti]], a kindred based in [[Cowal]] on the mainland of Scotland.<ref name=Caldwell21>Caldwell (2011) pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> The ''Senchus'' also lists what is believed to be the oldest reference to a naval battle in the [[British Isles]]<U+2014>a brief record of an engagement between rival D<U+00E1>l Riatan groups in 719.<ref>Rodger (1997) p. 5</ref>

There is evidence of another kindred on Islay, the Cen<U+00E9>l Conchride, descended from a brother of the legendary D<U+00E1>l Riatan king [[Fergus M<U+00F3>r mac Eirc|Fergus M<U+00F3>r]] but its existence seems to have been brief and the four hundred and thirty households of the island are later said to have been divided between three great-grandsons of the eponymous founder of Cen<U+00E9>l n<U+00D3>engus: Lugaid, Connal and Gal<U+00E1>n.<ref name=Caldwell21/>

===Norse influence and the Kingdom of the Isles===
[[File:Standing stone, Finlaggan - geograph.org.uk - 753904.jpg|thumb|[[Standing stone]] at Carragh Bh<U+00E0>n, said to mark the grave of [[Godred Crovan]], [[Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Isles]]<ref name=Campbell89>Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) p. 89</ref> The ruins on Eilean M<U+00F2>r, [[Finlaggan]] are visible in the background.]]
The arrival of Scandinavian settlers on the western seaboard of Scotland in the ninth century had a long-lasting effect. For the next four centuries and more all the islands of the west fell under the control of various rulers of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]] most of whom were of Norse origin. As is the case in the [[Northern Isles]], the derivation of place names suggests a complete break from the past. Jennings and Kruse (2009) conclude that  although there were settlements prior to the Norse arrival "there is no evidence from the [[wikt:onomasticon|onomasticon]] that the inhabitants of these settlements ever existed".<ref>Jennings and Kruse (2009) p. 140</ref> Gaelic continued to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse period, but the [[toponymy|place name evidence]] suggests it had a lowly status, possibly indicating an enslaved population.<ref>Jennings and Kruse (2007) p. 86</ref>

[[Godred Crovan]] was one of the [[Norse-Gael]] [[List of rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles|rulers]] of this Hebridean [[thalassocracy|sea kingdom]] who had a connection with Islay. His origins are obscure. The ''[[Chronicles of Mann]]'' call him the son of Harald the Black of Ysland, (his place or origin variously interpreted as Islay, [[Ireland]] or [[Iceland]]) and state he "so tamed the Scots that no one who built a ship or boat dared use more than three iron bolts".<ref name=Duffy04>Duffy, Se<U+00E1>n (2004) "Godred Crovan (d. 1095)". ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''. Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>MacDonald (2007) p. 62</ref> Godred also became [[Kings of Dublin|King of Dublin]] at an unknown date although in  1094 he was driven out of the city by [[Muircheartach Ua Briain]], later known as [[High King of Ireland]], according to the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.

Somerled's descendants became the rulers of various powerful [[Scottish clan|clans]], including the [[Clan MacDougall|MacDougalls]], [[Clan Donald]] and the [[Clan Macruari|Macruaris]]. [[Alexander of Argyll|Alexander MacDougall]]'s support of the opponents of King [[Robert the Bruce]] led to the forfeiture of his lands and they were distributed between [[Aonghas <U+00D3>g of Islay|Aonghas <U+00D3>g MacDonald of Islay]] and the chief of the Macruaris, Ruaidhri mac Ailein, who also held much of [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorne]], parts of [[Lochaber]], [[Garmoran]] and the North Isles.<ref name=Gregory24>Gregory (1881) p. 24</ref> These estates were eventually inherited by  [[Amy of Garmoran|Amie Macruairi of Garmoran]].<ref>Gregory (1881) pp. 26<U+2013>27</ref><ref>Lee (1920) p. 82</ref><ref name=O124/> She had married her MacDonald cousin [[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|John of Islay]]  in the 1330s,<ref name=H127/> and he now controlled significant stretches of the western seaboard of Scotland from [[Morvern]] to [[Loch Hourn]] and the whole of the Hebrides save for [[Skye]].<ref name=O124>Oram, Richard "The Lordship of the Isles, 1336<U+2013>1545" in Omand (2006) pp. 124<U+2013>26</ref> From 1336 onwards John began to style himself ''Dominus Insularum''<U+2014>"[[Lord of the Isles]]", a title that implied a connection to the earlier Kings of  the Isles and by extension a degree of independence from the Scottish crown<ref name=O124/><ref name=H127>Hunter (2000) p. 127</ref><ref>Oram, Richard "The Lordship of the Isles, 1336<U+2013>1545" in Omand (2006) p. 123</ref> and this honorific was claimed by his heirs for several generations.<ref name=Caldwell38>Caldwell (2011) p. 38</ref>

Initially, the MacDonald Lords' power base was  on the shores of [[Loch Finlaggan]] in northeastern Islay. Successive chiefs of Clan Donald were proclaimed Lord of the Isles there and their advisory "Council of the Isles" met on Eilean na Comhairle.{{#tag:ref|Loch Finlaggan has two main islands.

In 1608 the [[James VI and I|Scottish crown]] mounted an expedition to subdue them and then in 1614 handed Islay over to Sir John [[Clan Campbell of Cawdor|Campbell of Cawdor]] in return for an undertaking to pacify the island.<ref>Caldwell (2011) pp. 62<U+2013>64</ref><ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> This the Campbells eventually achieved although a setback occurred during the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]] when a [[Covenanter]] army under [[David Leslie, Lord Newark|Sir David Leslie]] arrived on the island in 1647.

===British era===
[[File:Cottage on Islay (18thC).JPG|thumb|A cottage on Islay from [[Thomas Pennant]]'s ''A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides'', published in 1774.]]
At the beginning of the 18th century much of the population of Argyll  was to be found dispersed in small clachans of farming families<ref>Morrison, Alex "Rural Settlement: an Archaeological Viewpoint" in Omand (2006) p. 110</ref> and only two villages of any size<U+2014>Killarow near Bridgend and Lagavulin<U+2014>existed on Islay at the time.<ref name=Caldwell75>Caldwell (2011) pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> (Killarow had a church and [[tolbooth]] and houses for merchants and craft workers but was razed in the 1760s to "improve" the grounds of Islay House.)<ref name=Caldwell75/> The agricultural economy was dependent on arable farming including staples such as barley and oats supplemented with stock-rearing. The carrying capacity of the island was recorded at over  6,600 cows and 2,200 horses in a 1722 rental listing.<ref>Caldwell (2011) p. 70</ref>

In 1726 Islay was purchased by Daniel Campbell of Shawfield.<ref>[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Campbell,_Daniel_%281671%3F-1753%29_%28DNB00%29 "Campbell, Daniel (1671?<U+2013>1753)"] Dictionary of National Biography (1904).

J. "The Industries of Argyll: Tradition and Improvement" in Omand (2006) p. 151</ref> Roads were built, the [[Crinan canal]] shortened the sea distance to [[Glasgow]] and the numerous traditional ferry crossings were augmented by new quays.

Initially, a sense of optimism in the fishing and cattle trades prevailed and the population expanded, partly as a result of the 18th century [[kelp]] boom and the introduction of the potato as a staple.<ref>Duncan, P. J. "The Industries of Argyll: Tradition and Improvement" in Omand (2006) pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref> The population of the island had been estimated at 5,344 in 1755 and grew to over  15,000 by 1841. However, the sundering of the relationship between the landowners and the island's residents proved consequential. When the estate owners realised they could make more money from sheep farming than from the indigenous small farmers, wholesale [[Highland Clearances|Clearances]] became commonplace. 400 people emigrated from Islay in 1863 alone, some for purely economic reasons, but many others having been forced off the land their predecessors had farmed for centuries. In 1891 the census recorded only 7,375 citizens, with many evictees making new homes in Canada,  the United States and elsewhere. The population continued to decline for much of the 20th century and today is about 3,500.<ref name=HSmith41/><ref>[http://www.islayinfo.com/islay_clearances.html "The Clearances on Islay in the 1800s"] IslayInfo.

==Gaelic language==
Islay has historically been a very strong Gaelic speaking area. Both in the 1901 and 1921 census, all parishes in Islay were reported to be over 75 per cent Gaelic speaking. By 1971, the Rhinns had dropped to 50-74% speakers and the rest of Islay to 25-49% overall.<ref name=MacT>Mac an T<U+00E0>illeir, Iain (2004) [http://www.linguae-celticae.org/dateien/Gaelic_1901-2001.ppt  ''1901-2001 Gaelic in the Census''] (PowerPoint) Linguae Celticae. Retrieved 19 September 2012.</ref> By 1991 about a third of the island's population were Gaelic speakers.<ref>[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2001/09/195 "Boost for Islay Gaelic centre"] (11 September 2001) Scottish Government. Retrieved 3 August 2008.</ref> In the 2001 census this had dropped to 24% which, while a low figure overall, nonetheless made it the most strongly Gaelic-speaking island in [[Argyll and Bute]] after Tiree, with the highest percentage recorded in Portnahaven (32%) and the lowest in Gortontaoid (17%), with the far north and south of the island being the weakest areas in general.<ref name=MacT/>

The Islay dialect is distinctive. It patterns strongly with other Argyll dialects, especially those of Jura, Colonsay and [[Kintyre]].<ref>Grannd (2000) pp. 61<U+2013>65</ref> Amongst its distinctive phonological features are the shift from long /a<U+02D0>/ to /<U+025B><U+02D0>/, a high degree of retention of long /e<U+02D0>/, the shift of dark /l<U+032A><U+02E0>/ to /t<U+032A>/, the lack of intrusive /t<U+032A>/ in ''sr'' groups (for example /s<U+032A><U+027E>o<U+02D0>n/ "nose" rather than /s<U+032A>t<U+032A><U+027E>o<U+02D0>n/)<ref>Grannd (2000) pp: 14, 73; 54<U+2013>55, 139; 59, 146; 51, 134</ref> and the retention of the [[Lenition|unlenited]] past-tense particle ''d''' (for example, ''d'<U+00E8>irich'' "rose" instead of ''dh'<U+00E8>irich'').<ref>Grannd (2000) p. 135</ref> It sits within a group of [[Isogloss|lexical isoglosses]] (i.e. words distinctive to a certain area) with strong similarities to southern Gaelic and northern [[Irish language|Irish]] dialects. Examples are ''dhuit'' "to you" (instead of the more common ''dhut''),<ref>Grannd (2000) pp. 17, 78</ref> the formula ''gun robh math agad'' "thank you" (instead of the more common ''m<U+00F2>ran taing'' or ''tapadh leat'' but compare [[Irish language|Irish]] ''go raibh maith agat''),<ref>Grannd (2000) pp. 22, 86</ref> ''mand'' "able to" (instead of the more common ''urrainn'')<ref>Grannd (2000) pp. 26<U+2013>27, 94</ref> or ''deifir'' "hurry" (instead of the more common ''cabhag'', Irish ''deifir'').<ref>Grannd (2000) pp. 33, 107</ref>
