The '''Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball''' team represents [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's [[basketball]] competition (the school's women's basketball team is known as the "Lady Raiders".) The team is currently coached by [[Billy Gillispie]]. Prior to Gillispie being named coach, the coach was [[Pat Knight]] who succeeded his father, [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Bob Knight]]. The Red Raiders currently compete in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. The team last played in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007]].

==History==
===1925<U+2013>1935===
Texas Tech's basketball program was founded the same year the school opened its doors in 1925. The inaugural game was a 37<U+2013>25 loss to [[Daniel Baker College]]. Tech would lose two more games before finally clinching their first ever victory<U+2014>35<U+2013>21 at [[Sul Ross University]].<ref name="History 1">{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/text-m-baskbl-a-pastres.html|title=Men's Basketball: Past Season Results|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics}}</ref><ref name="History 2">{{cite web|url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/archive/text-m-baskbl-a-history.html|title=Men's Basketball: History|publisher=Texas Tech Athletics}}</ref>

[[Grady Higginbotham]] was the first coach, earning a 14<U+2013>18 record over two seasons. Until [[Pat Knight]], Higgenbotham was the only Tech basketball coach to garner an overall losing record (.438) during his stay. Following Higgenbotham's departure, [[Victor Payne]] led the Matadors (as the school's teams were known until 1936) from [[1927 in sports|1927]] to [[1930 in sports|1930]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.areavoices.com/ppundit/?blog=5209|title=The Red Raiders nickname|publisher=Prairie Pundit}}</ref> His final tally stood at 32 wins and 20 losses. [[W. L. Golightly]] coached only one season, bringing in an 11<U+2013>9 record. [[Dell Morgan]] held the head coaching job from [[1931 in sports|1931]] to [[1934 in sports|1934]], chalking up 42 wins to 29 losses. He was followed by [[Virgil Ballard]]. Though Ballard coached only a single season, it was during his time that the team won their milestone 100th game, a one-point victory over House of David. Ballard left with a 15<U+2013>9 record.<ref name="History 1" />

[[Image:Polk Robison 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Polk Robison]]]]

===1935<U+2013>1971===
[[Berl Huffman]] was twice the head basketball coach at Texas Tech<U+2014>first from [[1935 in sports|1935]] to [[1942 in sports|1942]] and then from [[1946 in sports|1946]] to [[1947 in sports|1947]]. During his total of eight seasons, he garnered a record of 121<U+2013>67. [[Polk Robison]] was the only other person to serve two different times as the head basketball coach at the school. When Huffman left in 1942, Robison took the job. And, when Huffman left a second time in 1947, it was Robison who again filled the position, this time remaining until [[1961 in sports|1961]]. At a total of 18 seasons, his stay is the second longest of any Red Raiders basketball coach, behind [[Gerald Myers]]. He departed after leading his teams to 254 wins, 195 losses, and the first two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournaments]] in school history.<ref name="History 2" />

[[Gene Gibson]] followed Robison into the position. In his eight seasons, he chalked up the second best conference record in Texas Tech history and lead the Raiders to a Southwest Conference Championship in 1962. He[[Bob Bass]] led the program to a 22<U+2013>15 record over a season-and-a-half before returning to professional basketball coaching duties.<ref name="History 2" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/news/bass_retires040505.html|title=Hornets General Manager Bob Bass Retires|publisher=[[New Orleans Hornets|Charlotte Hornets]]}}</ref>

===1971<U+2013>2001===
[[Gerald Myers]] became coach of the Red Raiders mid-year during the 1970/71 season and stayed until 1991. His stay was the longest of any head basketball coach at Tech, and several milestones were passed during his tenure, including wins #600 ([[TCU Horned Frogs|TCU]]), #700 ([[SMU Mustangs|SMU]]), #800 (at SMU), and #900 ([[Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball|Texas A&M]]). With a Texas Tech career record of 326<U+2013>261, Myers has more wins with the Red Raiders than any other men's basketball coach in school history. Myers led Tech to 16 winning seasons, two [[Southwest Conference]] championships, three [[Southwest Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|SWC tournament]] titles, and four [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] berths.<ref name="History 2" /> Myers served as the school's athletic director from 1996 to 2011.

[[James Dickey (basketball coach)|James Dickey]] replaced Myers as head coach prior to the 1991/92 season and would remain at Texas Tech until his dismissal at the end of the 2000/01 season. During his 10 seasons at Texas Tech, Dickey amassed a 166<U+2013>124 win-loss record (164<U+2013>123 with vacated games omitted). The program also won its 1,000th game under Dickey<U+2014>a 71<U+2013>62 victory at [[Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans|UALR]].<ref name="History 2" />

Dickey took over a Texas Tech program that had finished with a 13<U+2013>45 combined record over Myers' final two years and led his first team to a winning season and fifth-place finish in [[Southwest Conference]] play, after having been picked to finish last in the conference. In his second year as head coach, the Red Raiders won the Southwest Conference tournament championship, the school's fourth, to secure the league's automatic bid to the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. Texas Tech finished the 1994/95 season with a 20<U+2013>10 record, sharing the SWC regular season championship with [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] and earning a berth in the [[1995 National Invitation Tournament]]. In the SWC's final season, Dickey's 1995-96 Red Raiders produced the most successful season in school history and one of the more memorable seasons in the history of the conference, finishing 30<U+2013>2 overall and undefeated in conference play, winning both the SWC regular season championship and the conference tournament title, advancing to the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|"Sweet Sixteen"]] in the NCAA Tournament, and finishing #8 in the [[Associated Press Poll|AP Poll]] and #10 in the [[Coaches' Poll]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Head Coach James Dickey|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|url=http://www.redraiders.com/mbball/dickey.htm|accessdate=2008-09-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070814184442/http://www.redraiders.com/mbball/dickey.htm|archivedate=2007-08-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Texas Tech Fires Coach, Clearing Way for Knight|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E7DF123AF933A25750C0A9679C8B63|accessdate=2008-04-29 | date=2001-03-10}}</ref>

The Raiders moved to the Big 12 for the 1996/97 season, and appeared to pick up right where they left off with a solid 19<U+2013>9 season. It was discovered during the inaugural [[Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 basketball tournament]], however, that two players were academically ineligible. Hours after the team's first-round game, Texas Tech announced that it was withdrawing from postseason consideration and forfeiting its entire conference schedule. The Raiders had lost that game, and would have had to forfeit it if they had won. A subsequent investigation revealed massive violations dating back to 1990 in men's basketball and nine other sports. As a result, the NCAA stripped Tech of its two NCAA tournament wins in 1996 and docked it nine scholarships over four years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tech receives four years probation|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|url=http://redraiders.com/news/98/08/04/tech_probation.htm |accessdate=2008-09-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060618132516/http://redraiders.com/news/98/08/04/tech_probation.htm |archivedate = 2006-06-18}}</ref> Dickey was unable to recover from the lost scholarships and was fired after his 2000/01 team produced a 9<U+2013>19 overall record<U+2014>the program's fourth straight losing season.

[[Image:bobknight.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bob Knight]] (middle) with [[Pat Knight]] (right)]]

===2001<U+2013>2008 (Bob Knight era)===
[[Bob Knight]] served as the Texas Tech men's basketball head coach from [[2001 in sports|2001]]<U+2013>[[2008 in sports|2008]].

Hired in March 2001 to replace James Dickey as head coach, [[Bob Knight]] quickly improved the program, which had not received a bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] nor achieved a winning record since 1996. Knight led the Red Raiders to three NCAA Tournament appearances and one [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] appearance in his first four years at Texas Tech, including an appearance in the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Sweet Sixteen]] in 2005. Texas Tech finished the 2005/06 season with a 15<U+2013>17 overall record, marking the only time that Knight finished a complete season at Tech with a losing record and fewer than 21 wins. During the 2005-06 season, the ESPN reality TV show centering around Knight and the Red Raiders, ''[[Knight School (TV series)|Knight School]]'', was filmed. The Red Raiders recovered in 2006/07, finishing 21<U+2013>13 and again earning a bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they would lose to [[Boston College Eagles basketball|Boston College]] in the first round. In both 2006 and 2007, Knight's Texas Tech teams defeated two top 10-ranked teams in consecutive weeks. During Knight's first six years at Texas Tech, the Red Raiders won 126 games, an average of 21 wins per season.

On New Year's Day [[2007 in sports|2007]], Texas Tech recorded a 70<U+2013>68 defeat of [[New Mexico Lobos basketball|New Mexico]] to give Knight his 880th career victory, making him the winningest coach in men's college basketball history.

On January 16, 2008, Knight registered his 900th career victory when the Red Raiders upset the ninth-ranked [[2007-08 Texas A&M Aggies men's basketball team|Texas A&M Aggies]], 68<U+2013>53.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280162641|title=Tech easily handles Texas A&M as Knight wins 900th game|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> Knight won two more games as head coach<U+2014>against [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] and [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]<U+2014>prior to announcing his retirement on February 4, 2008, after having led his 2007-08 team to a 12<U+2013>8 mid-season record. His son [[Pat Knight]], the head coach designate since 2005, was immediately named as his successor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/020408/loc_243647726.shtml|title=Knight resigns effective immediately|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''|accessdate=2008-02-04|date=2008-02-04|author=Walker, Jeff}}</ref> The younger Knight stated that, after many years of coaching, his father was exhausted and ready to retire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/seth_davis/02/05/davis.night/|title='He was just worn out':Pat Knight sheds light on father's decision to leave|publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|accessdate=2008-02-05|date=2008-02-05|author=Davis, Seth}}</ref>

Bob Knight finished with an overall win-loss record of 138&ndash;82 at Texas Tech.

===2008<U+2013>2011 (Pat Knight era)===
[[Image:Tech win over UT 001.jpg|thumb|Students and fans rush the court after the unranked Red Raiders upset the #5 Texas Longhorns in 2008.]]
After assuming the heading coaching role midseason, [[Pat Knight]]'s initial two games were defeats on the road. The first was an 80&ndash;74 loss to [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] on February 6, 2008. The second came three days later at [[Nebraska Cornhuskers basketball|Nebraska]]. Knight's first head coaching win came at home when the Red Raiders upset #18 [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]], 84&ndash;75, at [[United Spirit Arena]]. Going into the game, KSU was in sole possession of first place in the [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2008/02/14/Sports/Pat-Knight.Earns.First.Win.As.Head.Coach-3209580.shtml|title=Pat Knight earns first win as head coach|publisher=''[[The Daily Toreador]]''|accessdate=2008-02-14|date=2008-02-14|author=Coleman, Adam}}</ref> On March 1, 2008, the Red Raiders again defeated the top team in the conference by beating #5 [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]], 83<U+2013>80, ending a month-long, eight-game winning streak for the Longhorns.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5584658.html|title=Tech halts UT's win streak with 83-80 victory|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2008-03-01|date=2008-03-01|author=Fallas, Bernardo}}</ref>

The Red Raiders finished the regular season with back-to-back losses, first at [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]] and then to Baylor. At the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament]], they added another loss&mdash;to [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]<U+2014>in the first round. The team did not receive an invitation to play at either the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] or at the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. Texas Tech did get an invitation to the inaugural [[College Basketball Invitational]], but declined the offer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/031708/red_258542291.shtml|title=Knocked Out!

In the third game of the [[2008<U+2013>09 Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball team|2008<U+2013>09 season]], Tech defeated [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] opponent [[East Central University]] 167<U+2013>115, setting a new school record for most points scored in a game. The previous record of 128 was set in the double overtime victory over [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] on February 20, 1994. The combined total of 282 points also became a new record.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/national/stories/112108dnspotechmen.395a6f0.html|title=Men's basketball: Texas Tech 167, East Central 115}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytoreador.com/media/storage/paper870/news/2008/11/21/Sports/Red-Raider.Mens.Basketball.Knocks.Out.East.Central.In.RecordSetting.Victory-3556934.shtml|title=Red Raider men's basketball knocks out East Central in record-setting victory}}</ref>
