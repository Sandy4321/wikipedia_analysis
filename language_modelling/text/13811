  |Holding=The Court held 6-3 that Title III applied to foreign-flag cruise ships in U.S. waters. Justice Kennedy delivered the Court's controlling opinion, which held that Title III did not apply to foreign ships' internal affairs, because there was no "clear congressional statement" showing an intent to do so. A clear statement was necessary before a general law could interfere with a foreign-vessel's internal affairs. Title III's own limitations, however, prevented the statute from imposing requirements that would have threatened safety on the ship or conflicted with international obligations. If Title III were to impose certain requirements, such as major structural modifications, the clear statement rule could bar such an interference.<ref>[http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2004/2004_03_1388/ Spector v.

'''''Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.''''', [[Case citation|545 U.S. 119]] ([[2005]]), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision that determined (in a 6-3 decision) that the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) applies to foreign [[cruise ship]]s in American waters. The case was argued [[February 28]], [[2005]] and decided [[June 6]], 2005. 

==Prior history==
Douglas Spector and the four other [[Disability|disabled]] [[plaintiff]]s are bound to [[mobility scooter]]s and [[wheelchair]]s. They sued [[Norwegian Cruise Line]] under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act after traveling aboard cruise ships (the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian Star) registered in the [[Bahamas]]. Spector had purchased premium tickets, which were marketed as more handicap friendly. However, the ship was not easily accessible. He had limited or no access to [[swimming pool]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[elevator]]s, and [[Toilet|public restrooms]] because of physical barriers. The premium room was of lower quality than less expensive non-wheelchair friendly rooms. He was not allowed to participate in emergency drills and no emergency exit plan was laid out for disabled persons. Norwegian Cruise Line argued that American laws did not apply to the cruise liner because it was registered in the Bahamas. The cruise line's ships, however, were based out of [[Miami, Florida]] [[port]]s.

Spector first sued the cruise liner in [[federal district court]] in [[Houston, Texas]] (Spector's home town). The court ruled against Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. saying that despite their [[flag state|foreign flag]] they must abide by American laws when in American waters. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] overturned the lower court and moved for the case to be dismissed. Spector appealed the case to the Supreme Court and it heard the case on February 28, 2005.

== The bench ==
The Supreme Court gave its decision on June 6, 2005.  The judgment of the Fifth Circuit was reversed and the case was remanded. The makeup of the Supreme Court and their opinions were:
