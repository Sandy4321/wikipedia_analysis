'''Andoversford''' is a [[village]] and [[civil parish]] in the [[Cotswold (district)|Cotswold district]] of [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], about six miles east of [[Cheltenham]].  The [[parish]] had a [[population]] of 668 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]].

The village runs parallel to the [[A40 road|A40]] and is located on the [[River Coln]]. Amenities include a village [[post office]], two community or [[village hall]]s, a [[primary school]], a [[pub]] called the ''Royal Oak'', two local shops and a (mostly disused) animal stock market.

In addition to being servied by its own primary school, the village is in the catchment area for several excellent schools. These include the Charlton Kings Schools, [[Balcarras School|Balcarras]] (located in Charlton Kings) and the [[Cotswold School]]. The village of Andoversford is located on the bus routes for the Balcarras, Cotswold and [[St. Edward's School, Cheltenham|St Edward's]] (private) schools.  A wide variety of private schools are also within easy reach of the village.

The village has a strong community atmosphere and benefits from having several village meeting areas (pubs, schools, church, social club, play ground, etc) as well as hosting a variety of keenly attended annual events. These include point to point events held on the village's point to point course, an annual pig roast, a local music festival (Andoverfest) and several similar such events. The village also supports a football team, a cricket team and has local cubs and scout groups as well as having a variety of regular social events that receive strong attendance from the villagers themselves.   

In easy reach of Andoversford are three other pubs/restaurants: 
''The Frogmill'', a large hotel/pub/restaurant on the road from the A40 to Gloucester;
''The Kilkenny'' (which is currently closed and to let), a more upmarket, and more expensive, restaurant further up the same road;
and ''The Mill Inn'', a Samuel Smiths owned pub off the forementioned road in the small village of [[Withington, Gloucestershire|Withington]].

Andoversford meets the needs of keen golfers, having three courses nearby. These offer a range of social amenities from the very basic to the more refined and complete. Other sporting interests are also catered for - facilities include a gym /spa at the Cheltenham Park Hotel, shooting at the Ian Coley Sporting club and riding at several nearby riding schools.   

The village also boasts a local doctor's surgery, which is a branch of the nearby Sixway's clinic and which operates five days a week.

[[Cheltenham]] town is just 5 minutes away by car, further down the A40; [[Gloucester]] is 25 minutes, approximately.
