'''Chyna'''<ref name=namechange>{{cite web|url=http://www.aolcdn.com/tmz_documents/1107_chyna_wm.pdf|title=Copy of Name Change Document|date=2007-11-07|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> (born '''Joan Marie Laurer''' on December 27, 1972) is an [[United States|American]] [[Actor|actress]] and retired [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. A former [[bodybuilding|bodybuilder]], she is best known for her career with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) from 1997 to 2001, where she was billed as "Chyna: 'The Ninth Wonder of the World'". She began her WWF career as [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]]'s on-screen bodyguard, and the duo also dated in real-life. They were both members of the popular [[D-Generation X]] [[List of professional wrestling slang#S|stable]], a storyline alliance of several wrestlers, until 1999.

Chyna was the first woman to enter the [[Royal Rumble]], qualify for the [[King of the Ring]] tournament, and be the number one contender for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. In 1999, she was also the first (and only) woman to hold the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]], which she held a total of three times. She also held the [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]] once, before leaving the company in 2001. She claims that Levesque's affair with [[Stephanie McMahon]], daughter of WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], was a factor in her departure.

Outside of wrestling, Laurer has appeared in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine twice, as well as numerous television shows and films. In 2005, Laurer was a cast member on [[VH1]]'s ''[[The Surreal Life]]'', which led to several other celebrity reality appearances<U+2014>dubbed Celebreality<U+2014>on the network, including ''[[The Surreal Life: Fame Games]]'' in 2007 and ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]'' in 2008. She is also known for her tumultuous relationship with fellow wrestler [[Sean Waltman]], with whom she made a sex tape. It was released in 2004 and entitled {{nowrap|''[[1 Night in China]]''}}.

After returning from abroad, she held several different jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer in a band, and a 900-number chat line worker.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 18<U+2013>19.</ref> In her mid-to-late 20s, while living in the [[Florida Keys]], Laurer took a six-week class to train to be a [[flight attendant]].<ref>Laurer, Joanie.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Training and independents===
[[Image:Chyna.jpg|right|thumb|Chyna in the ring at the [[USAir Arena]] on September 15, 1997]]
Joanie Laurer trained at [[Wladek Kowalski|Wladek "Killer" Kowalski]]'s [[professional wrestling school|wrestling school]] in [[Malden, Massachusetts]].<ref name=only145>Laurer, Joanie.

Laurer met [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) performers [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]] and [[Shawn Michaels]] after a professional wrestling show in 1996.<ref name=only207>Laurer, Joanie.

===World Wrestling Federation===
====D-Generation X (1997<U+2013>1999)====
{{Main|D-Generation X}}
Vince McMahon later changed his mind by hiring Laurer, and she made her WWF debut on February 16, 1997 at [[In Your House 13: Final Four]]; her character emerged unannounced from a ringside seat to help Triple H during his match.<ref name=only269>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 259, 269.</ref> Her original role in the promotion was as the laconic enforcer/bodyguard for Triple H and later, his D-Generation X group (which included [[Sean Waltman|Sean "X-Pac" Waltman]]). She often helped Triple H (then, a rising villainous character) cheat to win by physically interfering in matches by executing her trademark low-blow uppercut to the crotch.<ref name=only269/> She was later introduced as Chyna, a play on words; [[fine china]] is delicate and fragile, which was a sharp contrast to her character.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 289.</ref> Off-screen, however, the male wrestlers were hesitant at first to let a female over-power them on-screen.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 274.</ref>

In January 1999, Chyna was the thirtieth entrant in the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]], becoming the first woman ever to enter the contest.<ref name=dynasty>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_4_2/ai_67872115|title=Chyna's Dynasty|publisher=Wrestler's Digest|author=Chamberlin, Thomas|month=December | year=2000|accessdate=2007-07-04}}</ref> The day after the Royal Rumble, Chyna became a villain by betraying Triple H and aligning herself with his enemy [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], his future opponent at [[WrestleMania XV]].<ref name=time/> Laurer teamed with Kane at the [[In Your House#St. Valentine's Day Massacre|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] [[pay-per-view]] against former allies X-Pac and Triple H.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/feb15_massacre.html|title=McMahon makes a Giant mistake|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

Following the dissolution of the Corporate Ministry, Chyna remained at Triple H's side.<ref name=time/>

====Intercontinental Champion (1999<U+2013>2000)====
In June 1999, Chyna became the first woman to qualify in the [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring tournament]].<ref name=time/> She was also the first female to be the number one contender for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]], but lost it to [[Mick Foley]] before [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] in August.<ref name=time/> Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with [[Jeff Jarrett]]. At [[WWE Unforgiven#1999|Unforgiven]], she had a match for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] against Jarrett, which she lost.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 311.</ref> She defeated Jarrett for the title at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] in his last WWF match, a [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Good Housekeeping match]], on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2003560001-2005201210,00.html|author=Lilsboy|title=The truth about Chyna|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=2007-04-12|month=May | year=2005}}</ref><ref name=only299>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 299.</ref> She also gained the services of his valet, [[Stacy Carter|Miss Kitty]]. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 314.</ref> His contract had expired on October 16, 1999, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingReviews/jan30_chyna-can.html|author=Powell, John|title=Chyna's book for fans only|accessdate=2007-05-14|date=2001-01-30}}</ref> If he had not appeared, the WWF would have been criticized for [[false advertising]], and the lineage of the title would have been broken.<ref>Laurer, Joanie.

Chyna then feuded with [[Chris Jericho]] over the belt, defeating him at the [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/nov15_survivorseries.html|title=Booking blows Survivor Series|author=Powell, John|publisher=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

As a result, then "head of authority" [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley]] declared them co-champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322608|title=Chris Jericho (Jan. 23, 2000<U+2013>Feb. 27, 2000)|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> At the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], Jericho and Chyna defended the title against [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]] to determine the Intercontinental Champion, which Jericho won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/jan24_royalrumble.html|title=Rocky wins the Rumble|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

====Eddie Guerrero; Women's Champion (2000<U+2013>2001)====
Not long after losing the Intercontinental title, Laurer became the on-screen girlfriend of then-villain, [[Eddie Guerrero]]. Guerrero and Laurer, originally villains, later became fan favorites during the summer of 2000, with Guerrero dubbing her his "Mamacita".<ref name=only7>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 7<U+2013>8.</ref> The couple both faced off against [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] and then-rookie [[Trish Stratus]] in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Intergender Tag Team Match|intergender tag team match]] at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]] with the Intercontinental Championship on the line.<ref name=gorilla>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/aug28_summerslam.html|title=Stunts highlight SummerSlam|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

At the same time, Laurer posed nude for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine's November 2000 issue.<ref name=fit/> Her ''Playboy'' modeling was also worked into an on-air WWE storyline, in which it drew the ire of the [[Right to Censor]] (a group of morally conservative and self-righteous wrestlers). Shortly after, Laurer began a feud with Ivory, a member of the Right to Censor, over the [[WWE Women's Championship|Women's Championship]]. This culminated in a storyline at the [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] where Laurer appeared to re-injure her neck while performing a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Handspring|handspring]] [[Professional wrestling attacks#Back elbow|back elbow]].<ref name=royal>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingPPV/jan22_rumble-can.html|title=Surprises dominate Rumble 2001|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

The relationship between Triple H, her former real-life boyfriend, and [[Stephanie McMahon]] (with whom Laurer claims he had an [[affair]] and then left her for), was a major factor in her departure.<ref name=sun/> She left World Wrestling Federation on November 30, 2001, several months after she had been taken off of television.<ref name=online>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/chyna.html|title=Chyna's profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-08-09}}</ref> [[Jim Ross]] later claimed that she was not fired, but rather chose to leave for personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrsbarbq.com/blog/2007/07/08/jr%e2%80%99s-bar-b-q-opening-the-duke-and-the-mick-well-represented-negative-comments-addressed-head-on-powerbombs-kane-jr-in-the-dungeon-with-stu-bar-b-q-pizza-jushin-liger-droz/

===Independent circuit and New Japan (2001<U+2013>2004)===
Laurer's in-ring career after WWE was limited. In 2002, Laurer joined [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and made her first appearance at the New Japan Thirtieth Anniversary Show, refereeing a bout between the [[Steiner Brothers]] and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] and [[Kensuke Sasaki]].<ref name=online/> In September and October 2002, she wrestled four matches for the promotion.<ref name=online/> After losing to [[Masahiro Chono]] on October 14, 2002, Laurer performed her final match on October 26, teaming with the [[John Hugger|Fake Great Muta]] in a loss to Hiroshi Tanahashi and [[Kenzo Suzuki]].<ref name=online/> Laurer also was scheduled to appear with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]], but she did not appear due to having [[pneumonia]].<ref name=interview/>

==Personal life==
Laurer's [[breast implant]]s were custom-made for her after her first implants were ruptured during a wrestling match.<ref name=only94/> She had also complained to her plastic surgeon that their largest implants did not suit her frame in the way she desired.<ref name=only94>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 94<U+2013>97.</ref> Laurer's custom implants became the model for the Chyna 2000s, a model of breast implant now marketed to large-framed women and female bodybuilders.<ref name=prego/><ref name=only94/> Laurer claims to have paid $6,000 for them.<ref name=guide/>

In seventh grade, Laurer had her first kiss with a much older teacher who worked at her school,<ref name=only98>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 98<U+2013>99.</ref> and during college, she was allegedly raped by two men after getting drunk at a party.<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 129.</ref> From 1996 until 2000, Laurer dated fellow wrestler [[Triple H|Paul "Triple H" Levesque]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCO/is_2_4/ai_88761521|title=Wrestler snapshot: Triple H|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=2007-09-20|month=August | year=2002}}</ref> They initially hid their relationship from their co-workers because Laurer felt that people might think she "[slept] her way to the top".<ref>Laurer, Joanie. ''If They Only Knew'', 277.</ref> The duo also lived together for some time.<ref name=only6/> Beginning in 2003, however, she had a tumultuous relationship with wrestler [[Sean Waltman]]. They were engaged for a period in 2003,<ref name=caught>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20050828/ai_n15617271|author=Wiser, Paige|title=Caught in the act|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=2007-07-04|date=2005-08-28}}</ref> then broke up, and then became engaged again, a pattern which continued for the next two years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. Eager for a repeat success, the company that released [[Paris Hilton]]'s [[celebrity sex tape]] obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name ''[[1 Night in China]]''.<ref name=tape/> The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits.<ref name=tape>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/19/fashion/sundaystyles/19tapes.html?ex=1300424400&en=fa8b001c1b104856&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=Sex, Lawsuits and Celebrities Caught on Tape|author=Ogunnaike, Lola|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-02-11|date=2006-03-19}}</ref> Laurer, however, maintains that she did not earn any money from the release.<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1145655056.shtml|title=Joanie 'Chyna' Laurer Interview: Talks about leaving WWE, HHH & more|author=Gerweck, Steve|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=2006-04-16}}</ref> In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for [[domestic violence|domestic assault]] after allegedly beating Waltman.<ref name=caught/><ref name=edge>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/01/29/914012.html|title=Chyna over the edge|author=Madigan, T.J.|publisher=The Calgary Sun|accessdate=2007-03-16|date=2005-01-29}}</ref> She claims that he was also abusive towards her during their relationship.<ref name=lifted/> On a February 2007 edition of the ''[[Bubba the Love Sponge]]'' radio show, Sean Waltman claimed that Laurer also previously dated [[Edward Leslie|Ed "Brutus Beefcake" Leslie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewrestlingnews.com/headlines/173184047.shtml|title=Sean Waltman Reveals Dating Former WWE Diva|accessdate=2007-02-11|date=2007-02-11}}</ref>

On February 8, 2007 (the date of [[Anna Nicole Smith]]'s death), a visibly upset Laurer appeared on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' to speak about her late friend. On the program, Laurer claimed that she "knew it was coming" because of the way the media had ridiculed Smith, and she drew parallels between the plight of Anna and herself. The wife of the CEO of Trim Spa, Monique Goen, however, claimed that Smith did not consider Laurer a friend.<ref name=LarryKingLive>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0702/08/lkl.01.html|title=The Death of Anna Nicole Smith - ''[[Larry King Live]]'' transcript|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=[[February 8]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref>

After leaving the WWF, Laurer was unable to use the name "Chyna" because of its trademark.<ref name=prego>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosC/chyna2_01dec05-sun.html|title=Fine dining and Chyna at Prego|author=Strobel, Mike|publisher=Toronto Sun|accessdate=2008-08-07|date=2001-12-05}}</ref> Therefore, she began to use the name "Chynna Doll" for public appearances.<ref name=edge/> In November 2007, however, Laurer filed papers to change her name legally to Chyna.<ref name=namechange />

Laurer has also had problems with substance abuse. She claimed that her "life was spinning out of control" around the time she made the sex tape.<ref name=interview/> In January 2005, Sean Waltman claimed that she was battling drug and alcohol addiction, as well as mental illness.<ref name=edge/> Days after the domestic dispute between Waltman and Laurer, it was reported in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that she had stripped naked and jumped into a [[fish tank]] in a New York nightclub.<ref name=edge/> That same month, she made another appearance on ''The Howard Stern Show'', where she was slurring her words and going off on random tangents.<ref name=edge/> On the program, she claimed to not want to do drugs anymore, but said that if a line of [[cocaine]] was in front of her, she would do it.<ref name=edge/> After her appearance, she entered a facility specializing in helping people with depression, and she decided to stop drinking.<ref name=interview/> In early 2008, Laurer appeared on the VH1 reality TV show, ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]'', but she claimed on the show that she did not consider herself an addict.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Intake|series=Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew|serieslink=Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew|network=[[VH1]]|airdate=2008-01-10|season=1||number=1}}</ref>

Laurer has a strained relationship with her family. She last saw her mother at the age of sixteen, and she claims that her father never got over her decision not to join the [[FBI]].<ref name=only6/> She also alleges that her father took out several [[student loan]]s in her name and without her knowledge, leaving her with $40,000 in debt.<ref name=only31/> On an episode of ''Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew'' in 2008, Laurer claimed to have a bad relationship with all of her family members, including her siblings.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Friends and Family|series=Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew|serieslink=Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew|network=[[VH1]]|airdate=2008-02-14|season=1||number=6}}</ref>
