'''Michael Carmen Pitt''' (born April 10, 1981) is an American actor and musician. Pitt is known in film for his role in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'', and in television for his role as Jimmy Darmody in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.

==Career==
===Theater and television===
Pitt made his [[off-Broadway]] debut in 1999 in the play ''The Trestle at Pope Lick Creek'' at the [[New York Theatre Workshop]]. A casting agent, whom Pitt mistook as a police officer attempting to arrest him, noticed him and recommended him for a guest role on the television series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' (he played Henry Parker in 15 episodes between 1999 and 2000). 

===Film===
Pitt's breakout role as the lover of a [[transgender]] rock star in ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' in 2001<ref>{{cite web|title=Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248845/|work=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=25 August 2012|author=IMDb|year=1990<U+2013>2012}}</ref> led to supporting roles in ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'' and in mainstream Hollywood fare such as ''[[Murder by Numbers]]'' and ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'', as well as the lead in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]''.

Pitt next appeared in [[Asia Argento]]'s ''[[The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things]]'', and headlined [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', playing a rock star "inspired" by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman, [[Kurt Cobain]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Last Days': Kurt Cobain in Thin Disguise|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/04/AR2005080401985.html|accessdate=25 August 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=5 August 2005|author=Ann Hornaday}}</ref> He performed all of the songs, which closely resembled Cobain's guitar and singing styles. On set, he met [[Thurston Moore]] of [[Sonic Youth]], who had been hired by Van Sant to serve as the film's music consultant. The pair formed a close bond, with Moore writing, "[Gus] wanted me to hang out with Michael and talk about his character, and let him be in character. We ended up spending a lot of time together. My daughter Coco still relates to Michael as Blake from Last Days."{{cn|date=August 2012}}

In 2007 he starred opposite [[Keira Knightley]] in ''[[Silk (2007 film)|Silk]]'', adapted from the novel by [[Alessandro Baricco]]. He played the lead role of Herv<U+00E9> Joncour, a French [[silkworm]] smuggler, who falls in love with a baron's [[concubine]] while in Japan. The same year he starred in the romantic comedy ''[[Delirious (2006 film)|Delirious]]'' as a young [[homeless]] man who befriends a celebrity photographer, played by [[Steve Buscemi]], and falls in love with a pop singer ([[Alison Lohman]]). The movie appeared at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. His more recent films include, ''[[Funny Games U.S.|Funny Games]]'', [[Michael Haneke]]'s remake of his own 1997 film, alongside [[Tim Roth]] and [[Naomi Watts]]. Pitt also starred in the crime drama ''Pericle il Nero'', released in 2009; however, the film is omitted from his IMDB profile and the film itself is also absent from the popular film website.

===Return to television===
He co-starred in the HBO series, ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' (about the rise of [[Atlantic City]] during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era), with [[Steve Buscemi]].

==Music==
Pitt sang and played guitar in his band, [[Pagoda (band)|Pagoda]], whose self-titled debut album has been released by [[Universal Records|Universal]]/Fontana/Ecstatic Peace. 

Under the title, "Jimi Pitt and the Twins of Evil", Pitt performed "[[Hey Joe]]" with the Twins of Evil for ''The Dreamers'' soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dreamers Soundtrack|url=http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/The+Dreamers+Soundtrack/5678512|work=Grooveshark|publisher=Grooveshark|accessdate=25 August 2012|author=Grooveshark|year=2012}}</ref>
