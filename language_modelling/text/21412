{{Gnosticism}}
The '''Gnostic Gospels''' are a collection of about fifty-two ancient texts based upon the teachings of several spiritual leaders including [[Jesus]], written from the 2nd to the 4th century AD. The [[Logia|sayings]] of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], compiled circa 140, may include some traditions even older than the gospels of the New Testament, possibly as early as the second half of the first century.<ref name=pbs/> These [[gospel]]s are not part of the standard [[Biblical canon]] of any major Christian denomination, and as such are part of what is called the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. Recent novels and films that refer to the gospels have increased public interest.<ref name=ThomasDebate>{{cite web|url=http://www.4truth.net/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=hiKXLbPNLrF&b=784449&ct=1201303 | title=Gospel of Thomas debate|accessdate=2007-04-22|author=Elaine Pagels and Michael Licona |publisher=Pax TV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhlintro.html |title=An Introduction to Gnosticism and The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=The Gnostic Society |author=Lance S.

The word ''[[gnostic]]'' comes from the Greek word [[gnosis]], meaning "knowledge", which is often used in Greek philosophy in a manner more consistent with the English "enlightenment". Some scholars continue to maintain traditional dating for the emergence of Gnostic philosophy and religious movements.<ref>See {{cite book

The documents which comprise the collection of gnostic gospels were not discovered at a single time, but rather as a series of finds. The [[Nag Hammadi Library]] was discovered accidentally by two farmers in December 1945 and was named for the area in Egypt where it had been hidden for centuries.<ref name=NagHammadi>{{cite web|url=http://www.nag-hammadi.com/ |title=The Nag Hammadi Library|accessdate=2007-04-22 |author=nag-hammadi.com}}</ref> Other documents included in what are now known as the gnostic gospels were found at different times and locations, such as the [[Gospel of Mary]], which was recovered in 1896 as part of the [[Akhmim Codex]] and published in 1955.  Some documents were duplicated in different finds, and  others, such as with  the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, only one copy is currently known to exist.

Although the manuscripts discovered at Nag Hammadi are generally dated to the 4th century, there is some debate regarding the original composition of the texts. A wide range and the majority of scholars date authorship of the Gnostic gospel of Nag Hammadi to the 2nd and 3rd century.<ref>{{cite book

== References in popular culture ==
The gnostic gospels received widespread attention after they were referred to in the 2003 best-selling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',<ref name=NPR>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5422879 | title=The Truth at the Heart of 'The Da Vinci Code' | author=[[Elaine Pagels]]| publisher = [[NPR]] | date=May 22, 2006 | accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref> which uses them as part of its [[Back-story|backstory]].<ref>Richard Abanes, ''The Truth Behind the Da Vinci Code'', 2004. ISBN 0-7369-1439-0</ref> The novel's use of artistic license in describing the gospels stirred up considerable debate over the accuracy of its depiction. As a result of public interest triggered by the novel and film, numerous books and video documentaries about the gospels themselves were produced which resulted in the gnostic gospels becoming well known in popular culture.

The 1999 film ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' uses the discovery of an as-yet unknown gnostic gospel as the basis for the story.  The end of the film also makes references to the Catholic Church's denunciations of such texts as being heretical.

Season 4, Episode 13 of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' is titled "Nag Hammadi Is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels."

The 2008 novel, ''[[Change of Heart (novel)|Change of Heart]]'', by [[Jodi Picoult]], also makes several in-depth references to the gnostic gospels - and to the Gospel of Thomas in particular.

[[Grant Morrison]]'s writing been heavily influenced by the Gnostic texts, most evident in ''[[The Invisibles]]''.
