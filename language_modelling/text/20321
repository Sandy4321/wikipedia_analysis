The '''external morphology of Lepidoptera''' is the [[morphology (biology)|physiological structure]] of the bodies of [[insect]]s belonging to the order [[Lepidoptera]], also known as [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. Lepidoptera are distinguished from other orders principally by the presence of [[Scale (Lepidoptera)|scales]] on the external parts of the body and appendages, especially the wings. Butterflies and moths vary in size from [[microlepidoptera]] only a few millimetres long, to conspicuous animals with a wingspan of many inches, such as the [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch butterfly]] and [[Atlas moth]].

The adult body has a hardened [[exoskeleton]], except for the abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent [[proboscis]] formed from maxillary [[Galea (insects)|galeae]], and are adapted for sucking nectar.

The wings, head parts of thorax and abdomen of Lepidoptera are covered with minute scales, from which feature the order 'Lepidoptera' derives its names, the word "lepidos" in [[Ancient Greek]] meaning 'scale'. Most scales are lamellar (blade-like) and attached with a pedicel, while other forms my be hair-like or specialised as secondary sexual characteristics. The lumen, or surface of the lamella, has a complex structure. It gives colour either due to the [[pigment]]s contained within it or through its three-dimensional structure.<ref name="Scoble scale">Scoble (1995). Section ''Scales'', (pp. 63<U+2013>66).</ref> Scales provide a number of functions, which include [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], [[thermoregulation]] and aiding gliding flight, amongst others, the most important of which is the large diversity of vivid or indistinct patterns they provide which help the organism protect itself by [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], and to seek mates.

=== General body plan ===

The body of an adult butterfly or moth (imago) has three distinct divisions, called [[tagma (biology)|tagmata]], connected at constrictions; these tagmata are the head, thorax and abdomen. Adult lepidopterans have four wings: a forewing and a hindwing on both the left and the right side of the thorax and, like all insects, have three pairs of legs.<ref name="Evans">{{cite book |title=Identification of Indian Butterflies|last=Evans |first=W.

The [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics which distinguish the order Lepidoptera from other insect orders are:<ref name="Gillot"/>{{rp|246}}

* ''Head'': The head has large compound eyes and if mouthparts are present, they are almost always a drinking straw-like proboscis.
* ''Scales'': Scales cover the external surface of the body and appendages.
* ''Thorax'': The [[prothorax]] is usually reduced.
* ''Wings'': Two pairs of wings are present in almost all taxa. The wings have very few [[insect wing|cross-veins]].
* ''Abdomen'': The posterior abdominal segments are extensively modified for reproduction. [[Cercus|Cerci]] are absent.
* ''Larva'': Lepidoptera larvae are known as caterpillars, and have a well-developed head and mandibles. They can have from 0 to 5 pairs of prolegs, usually 4.
* ''Pupa'': The pupae in most species are [[Glossary of entomology terms#adecticous|adecticous]] (with no functional mandibles in the pupal state) and [[Glossary of entomology terms#obtect|obtect]] (with appendages fused or glued to the body), while others are [[Glossary of entomology terms#decticous|decticous]] (with functional mandibles present in the pupal state) and [[Glossary of entomology terms#exarate|exarate]] (having the antennae, legs, and wings free).

=== Distinguishing taxonomic features ===

The chief characteristics used to classify lepidopteran species, genera and families are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336811/lepidopteran |title=lepidopteran |author= |year=2011 |work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |accessdate=12 February 2011}}</ref>

* the mouthparts
* the shape and venation of the wings
** whether the wings are homoneurous (the venation of the forewings and hind wings alike) or heteroneurous (forewings and hind wings different)
** whether the wings are aculeate (more or less covered with specialized bristles called microsetae) or nonaculeate
** the type of wing coupling (jugate or frenate)
* the anatomy of the reproductive organs
* the structure of larva and position of primary setae
* whether the pupa is exarate or obtect

The morphological characteristics of caterpillars and pupae used for classification are completely different from that of adults;<ref name="Heppner"/>{{rp|637}}<ref name="Mosher (1918)"/> different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae.<ref name="Mosher (1918)"/><ref name="Handbuch"/>{{rp|28<U+2013>40}} The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into systematics and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not apparent from examination of adults.<ref name="Handbuch"/>{{rp|28}}

== Head ==

[[File:Lepidoptera head gfhampson.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Line diagram of head of a lepidopteran insect seen from front and right side with labelling of parts and a legend.|[[Lepidoptera]] head illustration from G. F. Hampson's ''Moths of British India'' Vol. 1 (1892)]]

Like all animal heads, the head of a butterfly or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two [[Pedipalp|palpi]] and a proboscis.<ref name="Evans"/> Lepidoptera have ocelli which may or may not be visible. They also have sensory structures called ''chaetosemata'', the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled largely by the brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles.<ref name="scoble_heads"/> Unlike the adults, the [[larva]]e have one-segmented mandibles.<ref name="scoble_heads">Scoble (1995). Section ''The Adult Head <U+2013> Feeding and Sensation'', (pp. 4<U+2013>22).</ref>

The head capsule is well sclerotised and has a number of ''sclerites'' or plates, separated by ''sutures''. The sclerites are difficult to distinguish from ''sulci'' (singular <U+2013> ''[[:wikt:sulcus|sulcus]]'') which are secondary thickenings. The regions of the head have been divided into a number of areas which act as a topographical guide for description by lepidopterists but cannot be discriminated in terms of their development.<ref name="scoble_heads"/> The head is covered by hair-like or lamellar scales and found either as tufts on the ''frons'' or ''vertex'' (referred to as ''rough-scaled'') or pressed close to the head (referred to as ''smooth-scaled'').

The sensory organs and structures on the head show great variety, and the shape and form of these structures, as also their presence or absence, are important taxonomic indicators for classifying taxa into families.<ref name="Heppner"/>

Antennae are prominent paired appendages that project forwards between the animal's eyes and consist of a number of segments. In the case of butterflies, their length varies from half the length of the forewing to three-quarters of the length of the forewing. The antennae of butterflies are either slender and knobbed at the tip and, in the case of the [[Hesperiidae]], are hooked at the tip.  In some butterfly genera such as ''[[Libythea]]'' and ''[[Taractrothera]]'' the knob is hollowed underneath.<ref name="Evans"/> Moth antennae are either ''filiform'' (thread-like), ''unipectinate'' (comb-like), ''bipectinate'' (feather-like), hooked, clubbed or thickened.<ref name="Heppner"/>{{rp|636}} Some moths have knobbed antennae akin to those of butterflies,including the families [[Castniidae]], [[Neocastniidae]] and [[Euschemonidae]].<ref name="Moth Book">{{cite book |title=The Moth Book |last=Holland |first=W.

Antennae are the primary organs of olfaction (smell) in Lepidoptera. The antenna surface is covered with large numbers of olfactory scales, hairs or pits; as many as 1,370,000 are found on the antennae of a [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch]]. Antennae are extremely sensitive; the feathered antennae of male moths from the Saturniidae, Lasiocampidae and many other families are so sensitive that they can detect the pheromones of female moths from distances of up to {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} away. Lepidoptera antennae can be angled in many positions. They help the insect in locating the scent and can be considered to act as a kind of 'olfactory radar'.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/> In moths, males frequently have antennae which are more feathery than those of the females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/> Since females do not need to detect the males, they have simpler antennae.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/> Antennae have also been found to play a role in the time-compensated [[sun compass]] orientation in [[Lepidoptera migration|migratory]] Monarch butterflies.<ref name="Merlin et al (2009)">{{cite journal |last=Merlin |first=Christine |coauthors=Gegear, Robert J. & Reppert, Steven M.|year=2009 |title=Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory Monarch butterflies |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=325 |issue=5948 |pages=1700<U+2013>1704 |doi=10.1126/science.1176221 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5948/1700.abstract |pmid=19779201 |pmc=2754321}}</ref>

=== Eyes ===

[[File:SEM image of a Peacock Head, front view.JPG|thumb|alt=Scanning electron micrograph in black and white of the compound eyes of a butterfly seen from front.|Front view of the compound eyes of ''Inachis io'']]

Lepidoptera have two large, immovable compound eyes which consist of a large number of [[facet]]s or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the [[brain]].<ref name="Evans"/> Each eye may have up to 17,000 individual light receptors ([[Ommatidium|ommatidia]]) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/> One tropical Asian family, the [[Amphitheridae]], has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments.<ref name="Heppner"/> The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of [[skipper (butterfly)|skippers]].<ref name="Evans"/>

While most insects have three simple eyes, or [[ocelli]], only two ocelli are present in all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, one on each side of the head near the edge of the compound eye. On some species, sense organs called [[chaetosemata]] are found near the ocelli.<ref name="Evans"/><ref name="Triplehorn & Johnson (2005)">{{cite book |title=Borror and Delong's Introduction to the Study of Insects |last=Triplehorn |first=Charles A. |author2=Johnson, Norman F. |year=2005 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont, California |isbn=978-0-03-096835-8 |url=}}</ref> The ocelli are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as [[Stemmata#Stemmata|stemmata]].<ref name="Scoble-Sensation"/> The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.<ref name="Scoble-Sensation"/>

Butterflies and moths are able to see [[Ultraviolet|ultra-violet]] (UV) light, and wing colours and patterns are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region.<ref name="Heppner"/> The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen in normal light. The UV patterns act as visual cues which help differentiate between species for the purpose of mating. Studies have been carried out on Lepidoptera (mostly butterflies) wing patterns illuminated by UV light.<ref name="Heppner"/>

=== Palpi ===

[[File:Gastropacha populifolia02.jpg|thumb|alt=A brown moth with prominent snout on a white horizontal surface.|Snout moth ''[[Gastropacha populifolia]]'' (family [[Lasiocampidae]]) with modified mouthparts]]

Typically, the [[Glossary of entomology terms#labial palpi|labial palpi]] are prominent, 3-segmented, springing from under the head and curving up in front of the face.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/> There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi are separate and sometimes they are ''connivent'' and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but 'porrect' (projecting forward horizontally).<ref name="Heppner"/><ref name="Evans"/>
Palpi consist of a short basal segment, a comparatively long central segment and a narrow terminal portion. The first two segments are densely scaled and may be [[wikt:hirsute|hirsute]]; the terminal segment is bare. The terminal segment may be blunt or pointed; it may project straight or at an angle from the second segment inside which it may be concealed.<ref name="Evans"/>

=== Mouthparts ===

[[File:Section of Lepidoptera mouthparts.svg|thumb|alt=a coloured graphic showing a horizontal cross-section of lepidoptera mouth-parts with body parts labelled|'''Legend''': Section of mouthparts of Lepidoptera. a: pilifer (labrum); b: epipharynx (labrum); c: galea (maxilla); d: trachea; e: nerve; f: muscles; g: food canal; h: labium; i: labial palp.]]

While mandibles or 'jaws' (chewing mouthparts) are only present in the caterpillar stage, the mouthparts of most adult Lepidoptera mainly consist of the sucking kind; this part is known as the proboscis or 'haustellum'. A few Lepidoptera species have reduced mouthparts and therefore do not feed in the adult state. Others, such as the [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] family Micropterigidae, have mouthparts of the chewing kind.<ref name="Triplehorn & Johnson (2005)"/>

The proboscis (plural <U+2013> [[proboscis]]es) is formed from [[Galea (insects)|maxillary galeae]] and is adapted for sucking nectar.<ref name="Scoble - mouthparts"/> It consists of two tubes held together by hooks and separable for cleaning. Each tube is inwardly concave, thus forming a central tube up which moisture is sucked. Suction is effected through the contraction and expansion of a sac in the head.<ref name="Evans"/> The proboscis is coiled under the head when the insect is at rest and extended only when feeding.<ref name="scoble_heads"/> The maxillary palpi are reduced and even vestigial.<ref name="Heppner"/> They are conspicuous and 5-segmented in some of the more basal families and are often folded.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

The shape and dimensions of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a wider and therefore more advantageous diet.<ref name="Scoble - mouthparts"/> There is an [[allometry|allometric]] scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis<ref name="Agosta & Janzen (2004)">{{cite journal |last1=Agosta |first1=Salvatore J. |last2=Janzen |first2=Daniel H. |year=2004 |title=Body size distributions of large Costa Rican dry forest moths and the underlying relationship between plant and pollinator morphology |journal=[[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] |volume=108 |issue=1 |pages=183<U+2013>193 |doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13504.x}}</ref> from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long-tongued hawk moth ''[[Xanthopan morgani|Xanthopan morgani praedicta]]''.

There are primarily two [[guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]] in Lepidoptera <U+2013> the nectarivorous who obtain the majority of their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices of rotting fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family [[Sphingidae]]) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially [[Noctuidae|noctuid]] moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies.

== Thorax ==

[[File:Brush-footed.jpg|thumb|upright|The forelegs are reduced in the Nymphalidae.]]

[[File:InsectLeg.png|thumb|upright|Diagram of an insect leg]]

The thorax, which develops from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, consists of three invisibly divided segments, namely [[prothorax]], [[metathorax]] and [[mesothorax]].<ref name="Evans"/> The organs of insect locomotion <U+2013> the legs and wings <U+2013> are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.<ref name="Evans"/><ref name="Scoble_thorax">Scoble (1995) Ch. 3 : ''The adult thorax <U+2013> a study in function & effect'' (pp. 39<U+2013>40).</ref>

The upper and lower parts of the thorax ([[sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sterna]] and [[tergum|terga]] respectively) are composed of segmental and intrasegmental [[sclerite]]s which display secondary sclerotisation and considerable modification in the Lepidoptera. The prothorax is the simplest and smallest of the three segments while the mesothorax is the most developed.<ref name="Scoble_thorax"/>

Between the head and thorax is the membranous neck or {{anchor|cervix}}''cervix''. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements.<ref name="Gillot"/>{{rp|71}}<ref name="Scoble_thorax"/> Between the head and the thorax is a tufted scale called the [[pronotum]]. On either side is a shield-like scale called a [[scapula (Lepidoptera)|scapula]].<ref name="Evans"/> In the [[Noctuoidea]], the metathorax is modified with a pair of [[tympanal organ]]s.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

=== Leg ===

Fore-legs in the [[Papilionoidea]] exhibit reduction of various forms: the butterfly family [[Nymphalidae]], or ''brush-footed butterflies'' as they are commonly known, have only the rear two pairs of legs fully functional with the forward pair strongly reduced and not capable of walking or perching. In the Lycaenidae, the [[Arthropod leg#tarsus|tarsus]] is unsegmented, as the [[Arthropod leg#tarsomere|tarsomere]]s are fused, and, tarsal claws are absent. The aroliar pad ( a pad projecting between the tarsal claws of some insects) and pulvilli (singular : pulvillus, a pad or lobe beneath each tarsal claw) are reduced or absent in the [[Papilionidae]]. The tarsal claws are also absent in the [[Riodinidae]].<ref name="Scoble & Aiello (1990)">{{cite journal |last1=Scoble |first1=M.

In Lepidoptera, the three pairs of legs are covered with scales.<ref name="Heppner"/> Lepidoptera also have olfactory organs on their feet which aid in "tasting" or "smelling" food plants.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/>

=== Wings ===
{{Main|Insect wing}}

: ''See [[glossary of Lepidopteran terms|glossary]] for terms used''

Adult Lepidoptera have two pairs of membranous wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels.<ref name="Evans"/><ref name="Chapman_Thorax">{{cite book |title=The insects: structure and function |last=Chapman |first=R. F. |edition=4th |year=1998|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-57890-5|chapter=Thorax|page=45 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=vOkIvV0MrvYC}}.</ref> The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.<ref name="Evans"/>

The wings arise from the meso- and meta-thoracic segments and are similar in size in the basal groups. In more derived groups, the meso-thoracic wings are larger with more powerful musculature at their bases and more rigid vein structures on the [[Comstock-Needham system#costa|costal]] edge.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

Besides providing the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of [[Self-defense|self-defence]], camouflage and thermoregulation.<ref name="Scoble - mouthparts"/> In some Lepidoptera families such as the [[Psychidae]] and [[Lymantriidae]], the wings are reduced or even absent (often in the female but not the male).<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

==== Shape ====

The shape of wings exhibits great variety in Lepidoptera. In the case of the Papilionoidea, the [[Comstock-Needham system#costa|costa]] may be straight or highly arched. It is sometimes [[wikt:concave|concave]] on the hindwing. It is occasionally serrate or minutely saw-toothed on the forewing. The apex may be rounded, pointed or [[wikt:falcate|falcate]] (produced, and concave below). The [[termen]] tends to be straight or concave on the forewing while it is usually more or less convex on the hindwing. The termen is often [[wikt:crenulate|crenulate]] or [[wikt:dentate|dentate]], i.e. produced at each vein and concave in between them. The dorsum is normally straight but may be concave.<ref name="Evans"/>

The hindwing is frequently [[tail|caudate]], i.e. the veins near the end of the [[Tornus (insect anatomy)|tornus]] have one or more tails. The tornus itself being often produced and frequently lobed.<ref name="Evans"/> Along the hindwing termen there are tightly-packed scales in a double row. The underside of the scales project and form a regular narrow fringe referred to as [[cilia]].<ref name="Evans"/>

Tubular veins run through the two-layered membranous wing. Veins are connected to the [[haemocoel]] and in theory allow haemolymph to flow through them. In addition, a nerve and trachea may pass through the veins.<ref name="Chapman_Thorax"/>

Lepidopteran venation is simple in that there are few crossbars.<ref name="Handbuch"/>{{rp|88}} The wing venation in Lepidoptera is a diagnostic for distinguishing between the taxa as also the genera and families.<ref name="Heppner"/> The terminology is based on the [[Comstock-Needham system]] which gives the morphological description of [[insect wing]] venation.<ref name="Scoble_wing">Scoble (1995). Section "Wings". Pg 55.</ref> In the basal Lepidoptera, the venation of the forewing is similar to that of the hindwing; a condition referred to as "homoneurous". The [[Micropterigidae]] (Zeugloptera) have venation that resembles the most primitive [[caddisfly|caddisflies]] (Trichoptera). All other Lepidoptera, the vast majority (around 98%), are "heteroneurous", the venation of the hindwing differing from that from the forewing and being sometimes reduced. Moths of the families [[Nepticulidae]], [[Opostegidae]], [[Gracillariidae]], [[Tischeriidae]] and [[Bucculatricidae]], amongst others, often have greatly reduced venation in both wings.<ref name="Heppner"/>{{rp|635}}<ref name="Scoble_wing"/>{{rp|56}} Homoneurous moths tend to have the "jugum" form of wing-coupling as opposed to the "frenulum<U+2013>retinaculum" arrangement in the case of more advanced families.

==== Wing coupling ====

{{main|Wing coupling (Lepidoptera anatomy)}}

The Lepidoptera have developed a wide variety of morphological wing-coupling mechanisms in the imago which render these taxa "functionally dipterous".<ref name="Dudley (2002)">{{cite book |title=The biomechanics of insect flight: form, function, evolution |last=Dudley |first=Robert |year=2002 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09491-5}}</ref> All but the most basal forms exhibit this wing coupling.<ref name="Stocks">{{cite book |last1=Stocks |first1=Ian |editor1-first=John L.|editor1-last=Capinera |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC |edition=2nd |series=Gale virtual reference library |volume=4 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Reference |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |page=4266 |chapter=Wing coupling}}</ref> There are three different types of mechanisms <U+2013> jugal, frenulo<U+2013>retinacular and amplexiform.<ref name="scoble_coupling">Scoble (1995). Section ''Wing coupling'', (pp. 56<U+2013>60).</ref>

The more primitive groups have an enlarged lobe-like area near the basal posterior margin (i.e. at the base of the forewing) called a ''jugum'', that folds under the hindwing during flight.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/><ref name="Stocks"/> Other groups have a [[frenulum]] on the hindwing that hooks under a [[Retinaculum (moth)|retinaculum]] on the forewing.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

In all [[butterflies]] (with the exception of male [[Euschemoninae]]) and in [[Bombycoidea]] moths (with the exception of the [[Sphingidae]]), there is no arrangement of frenulum and retinaculum to couple the wings. Instead, an enlarged humeral area of the hindwing is broadly overlapped by the forewing. Despite the absence of a specific mechanical connection, the wings overlap and operate in phase. The power stroke of the forewing pushes down the hindwing in unison. This type of coupling is a variation of frenate type but where the frenulum and retinaculum are completely lost.<ref name="Dudley (2002)"/><ref name="Gorb (2001)">{{cite book |title=Attachment devices of insect cuticle |last=Gorb |first=Stanislav |authorlink= |chapter=Inter-locking of body parts |year=2001 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-0-7923-7153-3 |pages=305 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aiSOCbk3LRsC}}</ref>

== Scales ==
{{Main|Scale (Lepidoptera)}}
[[File:Mottenfl<U+00FC>gel in Mikroskop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wing scales form the colour and pattern on wings. The scales shown here are lamellar. The pedicel can be seen attached to a few loose scales.]]

The wings of Lepidoptera are minutely scaled, which gives the name to this order; the name 'Lepidoptera' was coined in 1735 by [[Carl Linnaeus]] for the group of "insects with four scaly wings". It is derived from [[Ancient Greek]] ''lepidos'' or [[wikt:<U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2>]] (scale), itself originating from the Greek ''lepis'' (female genitive singular form ''lepidos'') meaning "(fish) scale" (and related to ''lepein'' "to peel") and ''pteron'' or [[wikt:<U+03C0><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD>|<U+03C0><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD>]] (wing).<ref name ="Etymology of 'lepidoptera'.">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lepidoptera |title=Lepidoptera |author=Harper, Douglas|work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=21 November 2010}} from "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Lepidoptera Lepidoptera]" on Dictionary.com website.</ref>

Scales also cover the head, parts of the thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the genitalia. The morphology of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Downey |first1=J.C. |last2=Allyn |first2=A.C. |year=1975 |title=Wing-scale morphology
and nomenclature |journal=Bull. Allyn Mus. |publisher= |volume=31 |issue= |pages=1<U+2013>32 |url= |doi=}}</ref> and scales have been classified into three groups, namely hair-like, or ''piliform'', blade-like, or ''lamellar'' and other variable forms.<ref name="Scoble scale"/>

Primitive moths (non-Glossata and Eriocranidae) have 'solid' scales which are imperforate, i.e., they lack a [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].<ref name="Scoble scale"/>

A few taxa of the [[Trichoptera]] (caddisflies), which are the sister group to the Lepidoptera, have hair-like scales, but always on the wings and never on the body or other parts of the insect.<ref name="Heppner"/> Caddisflies also possess caudal cerci on the abdomen, a feature absent in the Lepidoptera.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/> According to Scoble (2005),<ref name="Scoble scale"/> "morphologically, scales are macrotrichia, and thus homologous with the large hairs (and scales) that cover the wings of Trichoptera (caddisflies)".

=== Structure ===

Although there is great diversity in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other [[Glossary of entomology terms#macrochaete|macrochaetes]], arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell;<ref name="Handbuch">{{cite book |title=Lepidoptera, Moths and Butterflies: Morphology, Physiology and Development, Volume 2 |last=Kristensen |first=Niels P. |series=Volume 4, Part 36 of Handbuch der Zoologie |year=2003 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |isbn=978-3-11-016210-3 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5w8FgSGuH34C}}</ref>{{rp|9}} this arrangement provides a stalk or ''pedicel'' by which scales are attached to the substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the ''inferior'' lamella. The upper surface, or ''superior'' lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called ''trabaculae'' and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.<ref name="Scoble scale"/><ref name="Heppner"/><ref>Chapman (1988). Section ''Wings and flight'' (p. 190).</ref>

=== Colour ===

The scales on butterfly wings are pigmented with [[melanin]]s that can produce the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family [[Pieridae]] is a derivative of [[uric acid]], an excretory product.<ref name="Heppner"/><ref name="Gullan & Cranston (2005)">{{cite book |title=The Insects: an Outline of Entomology |last=Gullan |first=P.

Scales play an important part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct [[Patterns in nature|patterns]] which help the organism protect itself by [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]] and warning. Besides providing [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to be absorbed and are probably involved in [[thermoregulation]]. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help [[aposematism|communicate]] their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In [[Batesian mimicry]], wing colour patterns help edible Lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in [[M<U+00FC>llerian mimicry]], inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.<ref name="Scoble scale"/>

Scales may have evolved initially for providing insulation. Scales on the thorax and other parts of the body may contribute to maintaining the high body temperatures required during flight.

==== Androconia ====

Male Lepidoptera possess special scales, called ''androconia'' (singular <U+2013> ''androconium''), which have evolved as a result of [[sexual selection]] for the purposes of disseminating [[pheromone]]s for attracting suitable mates. Androconia may be dispersed on the wings, body, or legs or occur in patches, referred to as "brands",  "sex brands" or "stigmata" on the wings, usually in [[invagination]]s of the upper surface of the forewings, sometimes concealed by other scales. Androconia are also known to occur in the folds of wings. These brands sometimes consist of hairlike tufts which facilitate the diffusion of the pheromone. The role of androconia in the courtship of pierid and nymphalid butterflies, such as ''[[Gatekeeper (butterfly)|Pyronia tithonus]]'', has been proven experimentally.<ref name="Handbuch"/>{{rp|16<U+2013>17}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/24054/androconium |title=Androconium |author= |work=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Jason P.

== Abdomen ==

The [[abdomen]] or body is composed of nine segments. In the larva it ranges from segments 5 to 13. The eleventh segment of the larva holds a pair of anal claspers, which protude in some [[taxon|taxa]] and represent the genitalia.<ref name="Evans"/>

Many families of moths have special organs to help detect [[animal echolocation|bat echolocation]]. These organs are known as ''[[tympanal organ|tympana]]'' (singular <U+2013> ''typanum''). The [[Pyraloidea]] and almost all [[Geometroidea]] have tympana located on the anterior [[sternite]] of the abdomen. The [[Noctuoidea]] also have tympana, but in their case, the tympana are located on the underside of the [[metathorax]], the structure and position of which are unique and a taxonomic distinguishing feature of the superfamily.<ref name="Triplehorn & Johnson (2005)"/><ref>Scoble (2005). Chapter ''Higher Ditrysia'', pg 328.</ref>

The females of some moths have a scent-emitting organ located at the tip of the abdomen.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/>

=== Genitalia ===
{{main|Lepidoptera genitalia}}
[[File:Male genitalia Lepidoptera.jpg|thumb|Male genitalia of Lepidoptera]]
[[File:Female genitalia Lepidoptera.jpg|thumb|Female genitalia of Lepidoptera]]
The [[genitalia]] are complex and provide the basis for species discrimination in most families and also in family identification.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/> The genitalia arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures of all insects, with a wide variety of complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the ''ductus bursae'' in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.<ref name="Heppner"/><ref name="Britannica">{{cite web| url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/336811/lepidopteran | title = Lepidopteran | work = Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online | accessdate = 16 November 2010 | publisher = ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'', London}}</ref><ref name="Scoble_gen">Scoble (1995). Section ''Adult abdomen'', (pp. 98<U+2013>102).</ref>

The arrangement of genitalia is important in courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of a species' genitalia led to the use of the morphological study of genitalia as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of genitalia has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy.<ref name="Hoskins web site"/>

There are three basic configurations of genitalia in the majority of the Lepidoptera based on how the arrangement in females of openings for copulation, fertilisation and egg-laying has evolved:

* ''[[Exoporia]]n'' : [[Hepialidae]] and related families have an external groove that carries sperm from the copulatory opening (gonopore) to the (ovipore) and are termed Exoporian.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>
* ''[[Monotrysia]]n'' : Primitive groups have a single genital aperture near the end of the abdomen through which both copulation and egg laying occur. This character is used to designate the Monotrysia.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>
* ''[[Ditrysia]]n'' : The remaining groups have an internal duct that carry sperm and form the Ditrysia, with separate openings  for copulation and egg-laying.<ref name="Resh & Carde"/>

The genitalia of the male and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female).<ref name="Hoskins web site"/> In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] 'tegumen' and [[ventral]] 'viniculum'.<ref name="Scoble_gen"/> They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the [[aedeagus]]) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female.<ref name="Britannica"/> The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.<ref name="Britannica"/>

While the layout of internal genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join together to form a common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Scoble_gen"/>

When copulation takes place, the male butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm ([[spermatophore]]) in a receptacle of the female (called the ''corpus bursae''). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle ([[spermatheca]]), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during egg laying, which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the [[ovipore]]. The ovipore may be at the end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Scoble_gen"/>

Butterflies of the [[Parnassinae]] (Family Papilionidae) and some [[Acraeini]] (Family Nymphalidae) add a post-copulatory plug, called the [[sphragis]], to the abdomen of the female after copulation preventing her from mating again.<ref name="Heppner"/>

The males of many species of Papilionoidea are furnished with secondary sexual characteristics. These consist of scent-producing organs, brushes, and brands or pouches of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating with a male of the correct species.<ref name="Evans"/>

Tree species of hawkmoth have been recorded to emit ultrasound clicks by rubbing their genitalia; males produce by rubbing rigid scales on the exterior of the ''claspers'' while females produce sound by contracting their genitalia which causes rubbing of scales against the abdomen. The function of this noise-making is not clear and suggestions put forward include the jamming of bat echo-location, and, advertising that the bat's prey are prickly and excellent fliers.<ref name="GenitalZap">{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/hawkmoths-zap-bats-with-sonic-blasts-from-their-genitals-1.13333|author=Watson, Traci|title=Hawkmoths zap bats with sonic blasts from their genitals |website=http://www.nature.com/ |publisher=Nature Publishing Group|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref>

== Development ==

[[File:Metamorfose.jpg|thumb|Three stages of a sphingid moth <U+2013> larva (or caterpillar), chrysalis (or pupa) and adult (or imago)]]
The fertilised egg matures and hatches to give a caterpillar. The caterpillar is the feeding stage of the Lepidopteran life-cycle. The caterpillar needs to be able to feed and to avoid being eaten and much of its morphology has evolved to facilitate these two functions.<ref name="Scoble_immature_stages">Scoble (1995). Chapter ''Immature stages'', (pp. 104<U+2013>133).</ref>{{Rp|108}} After growth and [[ecdysis]], the caterpillar enters into a [[wikt:sessile|sessile]] developmental stage called a pupa (or chrysalis) around which it may form a casing. The insect develops into the adult in the pupa stage; when ready the pupa hatches and the adult stage or imago of a butterfly or moth arises.

=== Egg ===
{{See also|Egg (biology)}}

Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are [[oviparous]] or 'egg-layers'.<ref name="Gullan & Cranston (2005)"/> Lepidopteran eggs, like those of other insects, are [[centrolecithal]] in that the eggs have a central [[yolk]] surrounded by [[cytoplasm]]. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the [[embryo]] caterpillar until it escapes from the shell.<ref name="Nation (2002)">{{cite book |title=Insect Physiology and Biochemistry |last=Nation |first=James L. |year=2002 |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|isbn=978-0-8493-1181-9 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3v2tOvz1uQC}}</ref> The cytoplasm is enclosed by the [[vitteline envelope]] and a proteinaceous membrane called the [[chorion (egg)|chorion]] protects the egg externally.<ref name="Nation (2002)"/><ref name="chapman_egg">Chapman (1998). Section ''The egg and embryology'' (pp. 325<U+2013>362).</ref> The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.<ref name="chapman_egg"/>

In some species of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion adjacent to the vitelline layer which is thought to have evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.<ref name="chapman_egg"/>

The top of the egg is depressed and forms a small central cavity called [[Micropyle (zoology)|micropyle]] through which the egg is fertilised.<ref name="Evans"/> The micropyle is situated on top in eggs which are globular, conical, or cylindrical; in those eggs which are flattened or lenticular, the micropyle is located on the outer margin or rim.<ref name="Moth Book"/><ref name="Butterfly Book">{{cite book |title=The Butterfly Book |last=Holland |first=W. J. |year=1898 |publisher=Hutchinson and Co |location=London |chapter=Introduction |url=http://ia311004.us.archive.org/0/items/butterflybookpop01smholl/butterflybookpop01smholl.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |isbn=0-665-13041-4}}</ref>

The eggs of Lepidoptera are usually rounded and small (1&nbsp;mm) though they may be as large as 4&nbsp;mm in the case of [[Sphingidae]] and [[Saturniidae]].<ref name="Heppner"/>{{Rp|640}} They are generally quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.<ref name="Moth Book"/><ref name="Butterfly Book"/>

The eggs are deposited singly, in small clusters, or in a mass, and invariably on or near the food source. Captive moths have been known to lay eggs in the cages they have been sequestered in.<ref name="Moth Book"/><ref name="Butterfly Book"/> Egg size in the Lepidoptera is affected by a number of factors. Lepidoptera species which [[hibernation|overwinter]] in the egg stage usually have larger eggs than the species that do not. Similarly, species feeding on woody plants in larval stage have larger eggs than those species feeding on herbaceous plants. Eggs laid by older females of a few butterfly species have been noted to be smaller in size than their younger counterparts. In the absence of adequate nutrition, the females of the corn-borer moth ( ''[[Ostrinia]]'' spp.) have been recorded to lay clutches with egg sizes below normal.<ref name="chapman_egg"/>

While escaping, the newly hatched larvae of many species sometimes eat the chorion to emerge. Alternatively, the egg shell may have a line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge.<ref name="chapman_egg"/> The egg shell and a small amount of yolk trapped in the amniotic membranes forms the first food for most lepidopteran larvae.

The thorax bears three pairs of legs, one pair on each segment. The prothorax (T1) has a functional spiracle which is actually derived from the mesothorax (T2) while the metathorax has a reduced spiracle which is not externally open and lies beneath the cuticle.<ref name="Scoble_immature_stages"/>{{Rp|114}} The thoracic legs consist of coxa, trochanter, femur, tarsus and claw and are constant in form throughout the order.

Caterpillars have different types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a ''chalaza'' (having a single point) or a ''scolus'' (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.<ref name="Caterpillars of the Pacific NW"/>

The pupal abdomen exhibits the ten segments, spines, setae, scars of larval prolegs and tubercles, anal and genital openings, as well as spiracles. The pupa of borers display the flange-plates while those of specialised Lepidoptera exhibit the cremaster.<ref name="Mosher (1918)"/>{{rp|23<U+2013>29}}

While the pupa is generally stationary and immobile, those of the primitive moth families [[Micropterigidae]], [[Agathiphagidae]] and [[Heterobathmiidae]] have fully functional mandibles.<ref name="Scoble_immature_stages"/>{{rp|131}} These serve principally to allow the adult to escape from the cocoon.<ref name="Mosher (1918)">{{cite book |title=A Classification of the Lepidoptera Based on Characters of the Pupa |last=Mosher |first=Edna |edition=reprint |origyear=1918 |year=2009 |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |isbn=978-1-110-02244-1 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8oIb3KB3wLQC}}</ref>{{rp|34}} Besides this, all appendages and the body are separate from the pupal skin and enjoy a degree of independent motion. All other superfamilies of the Lepidoptera are more specialised, have non-functional mandibles, appendages and body attached to the pupal skin, and lose a degree of independent movement.<ref name="Mosher (1918)"/>{{rp|20}}

The pupae of some moths are able to wriggle their abdomen. The three caudal segments of the pupal abdomen (segments 8<U+2013>10) are fixed; the other segments are movable to some degree. While the more evolved Lepidoptera can wriggle only the last two-three segments at the end of the abdomen, more basal taxa such as the [[Micropterigidae]] can wriggle the remaining seven segments of the abdomen; this presumably helps them to protrude the anterior end from the pupal case before [[eclosion]].<ref name="Mosher (1918)"/>{{rp|28}}<ref name="Common (1990)"/> The pupae of Hepialidae are able to move back and forth in the larval tunnel by wriggling, aided by projections on the back in addition to spines.<ref name="Common (1990)"/> Abdominal wriggling is considered to be of startle value and discouraging to predators. In the case of a few [[Sphingidae|hawk moths]], such as ''[[Theretra latreillii]]'', the wriggling of the abdomens is accompanied by a rattling or clicking sound which adds to the startle effect.<ref name="Common (1990)"/>

In some species, such as [[Heliconius charithonia]], mating can occur inside the pupa of females by males.<ref>Sourakov, Andrei. (2008). Pupal Mating in Zebra Longwing (Heliconius Charithonia): Photographic Evidence. ''News of the Lepidopterists' Society'' 50(1):26<U+2013>32.</ref>

[[File:MP - ornithoptera alexandrae 1.jpg|thumb|right|Queen Alexandra's Birdwing, ''[[Ornithoptera alexandrae]]'', (Family [[Papilionidae]]), the largest butterfly in the world, has bright clours and distinctive markings which advertise its inedibility.]]
Lepidopterans are soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the immature stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages are exposed to [[predation]] by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably [[parasitoid]] and [[parasitic]] wasps and [[fly|flies]]) as well as fungi and bacteria. To combat this, Lepidoptera have developed a number of strategies for defense and protection which include [[camouflage]], [[aposematism]], [[mimicry]], and the development of threat patterns and displays.<ref name="Enchanted">{{Cite web |url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/butterfly/allabout/Defense.shtml|title=Caterpillar and Butterfly Defense Mechanisms |publisher=EnchantedLearning.com |accessdate=7 December 2009}}</ref>

Camouflage is an important defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the [[Common Mormon]] and the [[Papilio rutulus|Western Tiger Swallowtail]] look like bird droppings.<ref name=Enchanted/><ref>{{Cite book |last=Latimer |first=Jonathan P. |author2=Karen Stray Nolting |title=Butterflies |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |year=2000 |isbn=0-395-97944-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=5P-oyg5Dgl8C&pg=PA12&dq=Tiger+swallowtail&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Tiger%20swallowtail}}</ref>

Some species of Lepidoptera sequester or manufacture toxins which are stored in their body tissue, rendering them poisonous to predators; examples include the [[Monarch (butterfly)|Monarch butterfly]] in the Americas and ''[[Atrophaneura]]'' species in Asia. Predators that eat poisonous lepidopterans may become sick and vomit violently, and so learn to avoid those species. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well.<ref name=Enchanted/><ref name="ANC">{{Cite book |last=Kricher |first=John |title=A Neotropical Companion |pages=157<U+2013>158 |chapter=6 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Z3pgdvrSmG8C&pg=PA158&dq=defense+protection+butterflies&cd=7#v=onepage&q=defense%20protection%20butterflies |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-00974-2 |year=1999}}</ref> Toxic butterflies and larvae tend to develop bright colours and striking patterns as an indicator to predators about their toxicity. This phenomenon is known as [[aposematism]].<ref name="Santos & Cannatella (2003)">{{cite journal |last1=Santos |first1=J. C. |last2=Cannatella |first2=D. C. |year=2003 |title=Multiple, recurring origins of aposematism and diet specialization in poison frogs |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=100 |issue=22 |pages=12792<U+2013>12797|url=http://tropicalfrogs.net/yasuni/PDF/Santos_et_al.2003.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.2133521100 |pmc=240697 |pmid=14555763}}</ref>

Aposematism has also led to the development of mimicry complexes of [[Batesian mimicry]], where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and [[M<U+00FC>llerian mimicry]], where inedible species, often of related taxa, have evolved to resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult [[Sesiidae]] species (also known as ''clearwing moths'') have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a [[wasp]] or [[hornet]] to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by [[mimicry|Batesian mimicry]].<ref>{{Cite book |others=Marshall Cavendish Corporation |title=Insects and Spiders of the World, |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |date = January 2003 |volume=10 |pages=292<U+2013>293 |isbn=0-7614-7344-0 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=uvdpiSQUuesC&pg=PA592&dq=clearwing+moths+mimicry&cd=2#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>

[[Eyespot (mimicry)|Eyespots]] are a type of [[automimicry]] used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, the spots are composed of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's instinct to attack these wing patterns.<ref name="Caroll">{{Cite book |last=Carroll |first=Sean |title=Endless forms most beautiful: the new science of evo devo and the making of the animal kingdom |pages=205<U+2013>210|isbn=0-393-06016-0 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=CnnGKjzw3xMC&pg=PA205&dq=Butterfly+eyespots+defense&cd=3#v=onepage&q=Butterfly%20eyespots%20defense |publisher=W.

Some caterpillars, especially members of Papilionidae, contain an [[osmeterium]], a Y-shaped protrusible [[gland]] found in the [[Prothorax|prothoracic]] segment of the larvae. When threatened, the caterpillar emits unpleasant smells from the organ to ward off the predators.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/osmeterium |title=Osmeterium |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}</ref><ref name="About">{{Cite web |url=http://insects.about.com/od/entomologyglossary/g/def_osmeterium.htm |title=Osmeterium |last=Hadley |first=Debbie |publisher=About.com Guide |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}</ref>
