In [[Greek mythology]], '''Minos''' ([[ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|<U+039C><U+03AF><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03C2>}}) was a mythical king of Crete, son of [[Zeus]] and [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]]. After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in [[Greek Underworld|Hades]]. The [[Minoan civilization]] has been named after him. By his wife, [[Pasipha<U+00EB>]], he fathered [[Ariadne]], [[Androgeus]], [[Deucalion (disambiguation)|Deucalion]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], [[Glaucus]], [[Catreus]], [[Acacallis (mythology)|Acacallis]], and many others. 

Minos, along with his brothers, [[Rhadamanthys]] and [[Sarpedon]], was raised by King [[Asterion]] (or Asterius) of Crete. When Asterion died, he gave his throne to Minos, who banished Sarpedon and (according to some sources) Rhadamanthys too.

It is not clear if Minos is a name or if it was the Cretan word for "King".  Scholars have noted the interesting similarity between ''Minos'' and the names of other ancient founder-kings, such as [[Menes]] of Egypt, [[Mannus]] of Germany, [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] of India, and so on. There is a name in [[Linear A]] ''mi-nu-te'' that may be related to ''Minos''. According to La Marle's reading of Linear A (see below), we should read '''mwi-nu ro-ja''' (Minos the king) on a Linear A tablet. The royal title '''ro-ja''' is read on several documents, including on stone libation tables from the sanctuaries, where it follows the name of the main god, Asirai (the equivalent of Sanskrit Asura, and of Avestan Ahura). The name mwi-nu (Minos) is expected to mean 'ascet' as Skr. muni, and this explanation fits the legend about Minos sometimes living in caves on Crete.<ref>Hubert La Marle, Lineaire A : la premiere ecriture syllabique de Crete, Geuthner, Paris, 4 volumes, 1997-1999 (in the third volume, ch. XIV concerns kings and meetings)</ref>

== The literary Minos ==

Minos reigned over Crete and the islands of the [[Aegean Sea]] three generations before the [[Trojan War]]. He lived at [[Knossos]] for periods of nine years, where he received instruction from [[Zeus]] in the legislation which he gave to the island. This included the establishment of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederasty]] as a means of population control on the island community: They "segregated the women and instituted sexual relations among the males so that women would not have children."<ref>[[Aristotle]], [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']]; II.10.</ref> He was the author of the Cretan constitution and the founder of its naval supremacy.<ref>[[Herodotus]] 3.122; [[Thucydides]] 1.4)</ref>

In Attic tradition and on the [[Athens|Athenian]] stage Minos is a cruel [[tyrant]],<ref>Powell, Barry B. ''Classical Myth.'' Second ed. With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998, p. 346.</ref> the heartless exactor of the tribute of Athenian youths to feed the [[Minotaur]]. It seems possible that tribute children were actually exacted to take part in the gruesome shows of the Minoan bull-rings, of which we now have more than one illustration. 

To reconcile the contradictory aspects of his character, as well as to explain how Minos governed Crete over a period spanning so many generations, two kings of the name of Minos were assumed by later poets and mythologists. According to this view, the first King Minos was the son of Zeus and Europa and brother of Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon. This was the 'good' king Minos, and he was held in such esteem by the Olympian gods that, after he died, he was made one of the three 'Judges of the Dead',<ref>Horace, Odes 4.7.21.</ref> alongside his brother Rhadamanthys and half-brother [[Aeacus]]. The wife of this Minos ('Minos I') was said to be Itone (daughter of Lyctius) or Crete (a [[nymph]], or daughter of his stepfather Asterion), and he had a single son named [[Lycastus]], his successor as King of Crete.  Lycastus had a son named Minos, after his grandfather, born by Lycastus's wife, [[Ida]], daughter of Corybas.  This second Minos - the 'bad' king Minos - is the son of this Lycastus, and was a far more colorful character than his father and grandfather.  It is to this Minos ('Minos II') that we owe the myths of [[Theseus]], [[Pasipha<U+00EB>]], the [[Minotaur]], [[Daedalus]], [[Glaucus]], and [[Nisos|Nisus]].  Unlike Minos I, Minos II fathered numerous children, including [[Androgeus]], [[Catreus]], [[Deucalion]], [[Ariadne]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], and [[Glaucus]] - all born to him by his wife Pasipha<U+00EB>.  He was the grandfather of King [[Idomeneus]], who led the Cretans to the [[Trojan War]].

Since relations with [[Phoenicia]] were in later times supposed to have played an important part in the development of Crete, Minos is sometimes called a Phoenician. There is no doubt that there is a considerable historical element in the legend; recent discoveries in Crete prove the existence of a civilization such as the legends imply, and render it possible that not only Athens, but [[Mycenae]] itself, was once subject to the kings of Knossos, of whom Minos was greatest, though this suggestion has been disputed and is no longer widely accepted. In view of the splendour and wide influence of Minoan Crete, the age generally known as "Mycenaean" has been given the name of "Minoan" by Dr. [[Arthur Evans]], the chief proponent of a powerful Minoan empire, as more properly descriptive

Minos himself is said to have died at [[Camicus]] in [[Sicily]], whither he had gone in pursuit of [[Daedalus]], who had given Ariadne the clue by which she guided [[Theseus]] through the labyrinth. He was killed by the daughter of [[Cocalus]], king of [[Agrigentum]], who poured boiling water over him while he was taking a bath.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]] 4.79.</ref> Subsequently his remains were sent back to the Cretans, who placed them in a [[sarcophagus]], on which was inscribed: "The tomb of Minos, the son of Zeus."

The earlier legend knows Minos as a beneficent ruler, legislator, and suppressor of piracy.<ref>Thucydides 1.4.</ref> His constitution was said to have formed the basis of that of [[Lycurgus]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3. 2, 4.</ref> In accordance with this, after his death he became judge of the shades in the under-world.<ref>''[[Odyssey]],'' 11.568.</ref> In later versions, [[Aeacus]] and [[Rhadamanthus]] were made judges as well, with Minos leading as the "appeals court" judge.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]''; 524</ref>

== The mythological Minos ==
{{Greek myth (Hades)}}
===Miletus===
{{main|Miletus (mythology)}}
[[Asterios]], king of Crete, adopted the three sons of Zeus and Europa, Minos, Sarpedon and Rhadamanthus. In adulthood, the three brothers quarreled over a beautiful boy they were all in love with, by the name of [[Miletus (mythology)|Miletus]], son of Apollo and [[Areia]]. The youth however preferred Sarpedon, so Minos in revenge went to war and conquered the whole island. Sarpedon and Miletus escaped to [[Lycia]], where Miletus founded the city that bore his name. Other mythographers claimed that the beloved youth's name was Atymnios, and that he was the son of Zeus and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]].<ref>Apollodorus III.1.2.</ref>

[[Bernard Sergent]] claims that the story is a late invention in that the theme of competition for a beloved youth is not in keeping with the Cretan pederastic tradition, and there is no record of this Miletus prior to the second century BCE.

=== Glaucus ===
One day, Glaucus was playing with a ball or [[mouse]] and suddenly disappeared. His parents went to the [[oracle]] at [[Delphi]] who told them "A marvelous creature has been born amongst you: whoever finds the true likeness for this creature will also find the child."

They interpreted this to refer to a newborn calf in Minos' herd. Three times a day, the calf changed color from white to red to black. [[Polyidus]] observed the similarity to the ripening of the fruit of the [[mulberry]] (or possibly the [[blackberry]]) plant and Minos sent him to find Glaucus.

Searching for the boy, Polyidus saw an [[owl]] driving [[bee]]s away from a [[wine]]-cellar in Minos' palace. Inside the wine-cellar was a cask of [[honey]], with Glaucus dead inside. Minos demanded Glaucus be brought back to life, though Polyidus objected. Minos was justified in his insistence, as the Delphic Oracle had said that the seer would restore the child alive. Minos shut Polyidus up in the wine-cellar with a sword. When a snake appeared nearby, Polyidus killed it with the sword. Another snake came for the first, and after seeing its mate dead, the second serpent left and brought back an [[herb]] which then brought the first snake back to life. Following this example, Polyidus used the same herb to resurrect Glaucus.

Minos refused to let Polyidus leave Crete until he taught Glaucus the art of [[divination]]. Polyidus did so, but then, at the last second before leaving, he asked Glaucus to spit in his mouth. Glaucus did so, and forgot everything he had been taught.

=== Poseidon, Daedalus and Pasipha<U+00EB> ===
Minos was challenged as king and prayed to [[Poseidon]] for help. Poseidon sent a giant white bull out of the sea. Minos planned on sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided not to. He substituted a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed [[Pasipha<U+00EB>]], Minos' wife, with [[zoophilia]]. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasipha<U+00EB> was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, the [[Minotaur]] (half man half bull). Daedalus then built a complicated [[maze]] called the [[Labyrinth]] and Minos put the Minotaur in it. To make sure no one would ever know the secret of who the Minotaur was and how to get out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, [[Icarus (mythology)|Icarus]], along with the monster. Fortunately, both Daedalus and Icarus escaped the Labyrinth and the Minotaur's clutches, but they were [[marooning|marooned]] on Crete.

Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.

=== Theseus ===
Some time later, Minos' son, [[Androgeus]], won every game in a contest to [[Aegeas]] of [[Athens]]. Alternatively, the other contestants were jealous of Androgeus and killed him. Minos was angry and declared war on Athens. He offered the Athenians peace if they sent Minos seven young men and seven virgin maidens to feed the [[Minotaur]] every nine years (which corresponded directly to the Minoans' meticulous records of lunar alignments - a full moon falls on the equinoxes once every eight years). This continued until [[Theseus]] killed the Minotaur with the help of [[Ariadne]], Minos' lovestruck daughter.

[[Athenaeus]] (c. AD 200), in his [[Deipnosophists]], (XIII.601f), recounts a version of the tale in which the love of Minos for Theseus is the reason for his giving up his war against the Athenians.

[[Image:Minos scylla.jpg|thumb|right|250px|17th century engraving of [[Scylla (princess)|Scylla]] falling in love with Minos]]

=== Nisus ===
Minos was also part of the King [[Nisos|Nisus]] story. Nisus was King of Megara, and he was invincible as long as a lock of purple hair still existed, hidden in his white hair. Minos attacked Megara but Nisus knew he could not be beaten because he still had his lock of purple hair. His daughter, [[Scylla (princess)|Scylla]], fell in love with Minos and proved it by cutting the purple hair off her father's head. Nisus died and Megara fell to Crete. Minos spurned Scylla for disobeying her father. She was changed into a seabird, relentlessly pursued by her father, who was a sea eagle.

=== The death of Minos ===
Minos searched for Daedalus by travelling from city to city asking a riddle. Minos presented a spiral seashell to Daedalus and asked for it to be strung all the way through. When he reached Camicus, Sicily, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, fetched the old man. He tied the string to an ant, which walked through the seashell, stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince him to take a bath first. Cocalus' daughters and Daedalus then killed Minos by burning him with boiling water.

After his death, Minos became a judge of the dead in [[Greek Underworld|Hades]] together with [[Aeacus]] and [[Radamanthus]]. Radamanthus judged the souls of Asians, Aeacus judged [[Europe]]ans and Minos had the deciding vote.

== Minos in art ==
On Cretan coins, Minos is represented as bearded, wearing a [[diadem (personal wear)|diadem]], curly-haired, haughty and dignified, like the traditional portraits of his reputed father, Zeus. On painted vases and sarcophagus bas-reliefs he frequently occurs with Aeacus and Rhadamanthus as judges of the under-world and in connection with the Minotaur and Theseus.

In [[Michelangelo]]'s famous [[fresco]], [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]] (located in the [[Sistine Chapel]]), Minos appears as judge of the under-world, surrounded by a crowd of devils.  With a snake coiled around him, Minos watches as the damned are brought down to hell.

=== In poetry ===
[[Image:Inferno Canto 5 line 4 Minos.jpg|250 px|thumb|Minos, as portrayed in Dante's ''Inferno'']]
In the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil]], Minos was the judge of those who had been given the death penalty on a false charge - Minos sits with a gigantic urn, and decides whether a soul should go to [[Elysium]] or [[Tartarus]] with the help of a silent jury. Radamanthus, his brother, is a judge at Tartarus who decides upon suitable punishments for sinners there<ref>''Aeneid'' VI, 568&ndash;572).</ref>.

In [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', Minos sits at the entrance to the second circle in the ''Inferno'', which is the beginning of proper Hell. Here, he judges the sins of each soul and assigns it to its rightful punishment by indicating the circle to which it must descend. He does this by circling his tail around his body the appropriate number of times. He can also speak, to clarify the soul's location within the circle indicated by the wrapping of his tail.<ref>''Inferno'' V, 4&ndash;24; XXVII, 124&ndash;127).</ref>
