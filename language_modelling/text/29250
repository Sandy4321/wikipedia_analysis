'''John Montresor''' ([[22 April]] [[1736]] &ndash; [[26 June]] [[1799]]) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[military engineer]] in [[North America]]. 

==Early life==
Born in [[Gibraltar]] 22 April 1736 to British [[military engineer]] [[James Gabriel Montresor]] and his first wife, Mary Haswell, John Montresor spent his early life there (and presumably on [[Minorca]], where his father was briefly stationed).  He was in England between 1746 band 1750, attending Westminster School. He learned the principles of [[engineering]] from his father, and in his later teens served as assistant engineer to his father at Gibraltar.  

==French and Indian Wars==
In [[1754]], he accompanied his father to America, and served as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the 48th Regiment of Foot on the [[Braddock expedition|expedition to Fort Duquesne]], also performing as a supernumery engineer. In the defeat that followed he was wounded, but survived to learn of his promotion to [[lieutenant]] days before the battle. He remained in America, serving along the [[Mohawk River]] and at [[Fort Edward (town), New York|Fort Edward]], then accompanying British forces to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia (former city)|Halifax]]. In [[1758]], he was commissioned a practicing engineer, and as such was present at the siege of [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]], and later, at that of [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Quebec]], there drawing one of the last known portraits of [[James Wolfe|General Wolfe]], who died in the deciding battle.

With the defeat of the [[France|French]], Montresor was sent to neighboring villages and as far afield as [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]], using the language of his [[Huguenot]] ancestors to elicit [[Oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]]. He was also twice sent overland from [[Quebec]] to [[Boston]] with dispatches, on one of these journeys, in a mid-winter [[blizzard]], being reduced to eating belt and shoe [[leather]] in order to avoid [[starvation]].  He also, during this period, performed various [[Surveying|surveys]] and prepared [[map|maps]] of [[Acadia]], the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and of his route along the [[Kennebec River]]. (The journal of this last expedition through the wilds of [[Maine]] would fall into enemy hands in the [[American Revolution]], and was used as a guide by [[Benedict Arnold]] in his [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|expedition against Quebec]].)

During [[Pontiac's Rebellion]], he carried dispatches and led troops to besieged [[Fort Detroit]]. He designed and built fortifications on the [[Niagara River]] at [[Fort Niagara]] and [[Fort Erie]] as well as a series of blockhouses and an early [[gravity railroad]] along the [[Niagara Portage]] between [[1762]] and [[1764]].

==Revolutionary-Era America==
Stationed at Fort George (the former site of [[Fort William Henry]]) in 1765, he witnessed rioting in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]] in response to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]], and in the same year was promoted to [[Captain-Lieutenant|captain lieutenant]], and engineer extraordinary, as well as barrackmaster for [[ordnance]] in [[British North America|North America]]. Over the next several years, he [[survey|surveyed]] the boundary between [[New York]] and [[New Jersey]], and he repaired or constructed [[barracks]] and [[fortification|fortifications]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City]], [[The Bahamas|the Bahamas]], and [[Philadelphia]], where he would build a fortification on Mud Island. During this period he also took a six-month leave in [[England]], and spent time on [[Bermuda]]. He also purchased an island in [[New York Harbor]] which would be called Montresor's Island (now [[Randall's Island]]).

He in Boston at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and marched with Percy to releive the Brittish troops returning from [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]]. He was appointed chief engineer in America and captain in late [[1775]]. He was present at the [[Battle of Long Island]] the next year, and was present at the execution of [[Nathan Hale]] on [[22 September]] [[1776]], being sent to the rebel lines under flag of truce to report the event, and he conveyed Hale's last words to [[William Hull]]. Having been superceded as chief engineer, he was placed as aide-de-camp on the staff of General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]], but was later reinstated as chief engineer. On [[13 January]] [[1777]] his home on Montresor's Island was burned. 

In [[1777]] he was involved in the [[New Jersey during the American Revolution|military campaigns in New Jersey]], and present at the action at Quibbleton. He also participated at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] later that year, and accompanied the army to Philadelphia where he launched the attack that destroyed his own Mud Island defences. He directed the construction of new defences for the city, and along with [[John Andr<U+00E9>]], he was one of the planners of the lavish ball, the ''Meschianza'', given in Philadelphia in honor of General Howe.  Again superceded in his role as chief engineer, he returned to England and, in March [[1779]] resigned from the army, bringing to an end over two decades of American service, all reported in journals (although many of these were lost).

==Retirement and death==
In England, he was called on to testify before [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] on the conduct of the was, and on several occasions was called on to support his expenditures during his various compaigns (for which he is said to have been imprisoned at one point]]. He purchased an estate at Belmont, [[Kent]], and had a residence at Portland Place, [[London]], and he served as director of the French Hospital. He toured Europe in [[1785]] and [[1786]], visiting [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. He died [[26 June]] [[1799]].

==Family==
Montresor's romantic life has been the subject of much writing. He married at [[New York City|New York]] 1 March 1764, Frances Tucker, who was born in New York, 23 April 1744, daughter of Thomas Tucker of [[Bermuda]], step-daughter of Reverend [[Samuel Auchmuty (clergyman)|Samuel Auchmuty]] and half-sister of [[General]] [[Sir]] [[Samuel Auchmuty (general)|Samuel Auchmuty]].  She returned to England with her husband, and survived him, dying 28 June 1828, at Rosekill, [[Kent]].  By her, he had General Sir Henry Tucker Montresor, John Montresor, General Sir Thomas Gage Montresor, William Robert Montresor (died, a soldier), and daughters Frances Margaret Montresor, Mary Howe Montresor and Mary Lucy Montresor, who married General Sir Frederick William Mulcaster (brother of [[William Mulcaster]]).

In addition to these relationships, he also had other more irregular connections.  A surviving letter from Detroit, 1763, mentions the death of an apparent mistress, "poor Nancy", and that he had been "on the Common" since.  Likewise, he made a small grant to a local English farmer for support of the child of his daughter, of which John was the father.

Finally, his name appears broadly as the father of Frances, second wife of [[Ethan Allen]]. Born to a [[Mohawk River|Mohawk Valley]] woman on (Ethan Allen would later record) [[4 April]] [[1760]], Frances was adopted by her mother's later companion, [[Crean Brush]], one-time secretary of the Assembly of the Colony of New York. As to her paternity, when her daughter [[Frances Allen]] entered [[H<U+00F4>tel-Dieu]] in 1808, her mother's maiden name was recorded as Montresor. Her tombstone names her Montezuma, while an [[1858]] history written using family information calls her Frances Montuzan, relating that her father was a British colonel killed in the French and Indian War. Popular opinion makes John Montresor the father of Frances.  This has not been in small part due to his role in a popular best-selling novel of the time.

==Fiction==
John Montresor has gained a certain notoriety beyond his historical role due to the writings of his first-cousin [[Susanna Haswell Rowson]]. One of the main characters in her popular novel ''Charlotte Temple'', named John Montraville, was based, at least in part, on Montresor. In the sequel, ''Lucy Temple, Charlotte's Daughter'', Montraville is even said to lived at Portland Place, once Montresor's residence. In the original novel, Montraville seduces the title character, an innocent English schoolgirl, and induces her to run away to America. He then abandons her, sick and pregnant, repenting only in time to witness her death. Some authors have taken this to be a verbatim account of an event in Montresor's life, with only the name changed (the author subtitles the work, "A Tale of Truth"), while others see in it a fictionalized account of the circumstances surrounding the birth of the future Frances Allen. However, the tale also bears strong similarity to one told of General [[John Burgoyne]], and it seems likely that the author had more broad inspiration for her tale.
