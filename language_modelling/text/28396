Woodhouse stated that he'd "fallen out of love" with football and decided to turn to professional boxing, despite no previous experience. In September 2006, he won his first professional boxing match, defeating [[Dean Marcantonio]], on points, knocking him down twice in the final round. He was convicted of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006. As a result, he had his boxing license suspended for five months by the [[British Boxing Board of Control]], despite the incident happening before he was under the BBBofC's jurisdiction. Woodhouse turned back to football in November 2006, joining Rushden & Diamonds in the [[Conference National]].
