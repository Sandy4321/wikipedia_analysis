The '''Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist-Leninist)''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[anti-revisionist]] [[communist]] [[political party]].

The party was set up in July 2004 by a group of communists who had either been expelled or had resigned from [[Arthur Scargill]]'s  [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]].  Many of them had previously been members of the [[Association of Communist Workers]].

The CPGB-ML adheres to [[Marxism-Leninism]] as developed by [[Marx]], [[Engels]], [[Lenin]] and [[Stalin]]. They consider that, after the death of Stalin, [[Marxist revisionism|revisionists]] in the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] leadership undermined [[socialism]] to the point where the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed. It is especially opposed to [[imperialism]] and to whit support the [[Irish Republican]] movement, the [[Iraqi Resistance]], [[Cuba]], the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and the [[Mugabe]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]]. The party places emphasis on the importance of theory and education, as "''it is incumbent upon all those who are serious about abolishing imperialism to study and master the science of Marxism-Leninism <U+2013> not in dry abstraction or as an intellectual exercise, but in order that they learn to apply it to the ever-changing situation in which they operate; in order to arm themselves with a guide to practice, without which the working class will never free itself from the chains of capitalist slavery.''[http://www.cpgb-ml.org/index.php?secName=proletarian&subName=display&art=9]

It publishes the bi-monthly journal ''Proletarian''.

Although the party is relatively new, many of its members have been active in the communist and/or workers' movement for decades. The party Chair, [[Harpal Brar]], has been editor of the Marxist-Leninist journal [[Lalkar]] (formerly the organ of the [[Indian Workers Association (GB)]]) since 1979 and has written books on many aspects of imperialism (see his entry for full listing).

Many CPGB-ML members are also active in the [[Stalin Society]].

This party should not be confused with the older, [[Maoist]] [[Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist)]].
