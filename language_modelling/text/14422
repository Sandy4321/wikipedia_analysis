== History ==

''Svoboda'' was founded in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]<ref name="loc">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn80012518/ About this Newspaper: Svoboda] - [[Chronicling America]] - The Library of Congress</ref> on 11 September 1893 by Father Hryhoriii Hrushka. It became a bi-weekly newspaper on 1 March 1894, a tri-weekly on 8 August 1914, and a daily on 3 January 1921. ''Svoboda'' was an important '[[Spokesperson|mouthpiece]]" for [[Ukrainian American|Ukrainians in North America]], and played an important role in the discussing and solving of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] difficulties. Prior to the establishment of Ukrainian-Canadian periodicals (for eg. the ''Kanadiiskyi Farmer'' ("Canadian Farmer"), it was the only Ukrainian-language newspaper of any note in [[Canada]].<ref name="Petryshyn">[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=XfKkhhHa1tgC&dq Jaroslav Petryshyn, Luba Dzubak, ''Peasants in the Promised Land: Canada and the Ukrainians, 1891-1914'' James Lorimer & Company, 1985] pp.46, 87-88 ISBN 978-0-88862-925-8</ref>

Ukrainians not only in the United States and Canada, but also in [[Brazil]], [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and [[Bukovyna]], subscribed to it. It provided a channel of communication for those of the intelligentsia concerned with ''emigration'' of Ukrainian [[peasant]]s and life in the [[New World]].<ref name="Petryshyn" />

The Ukrainian [[intelligentsia]], through ''Svoboda'', sought to prepare the peasants for an improved lifestyle, and to offer advice in regard to breaking out of the peasant mold and to conform to the ideals of European civilization. Through a program of enlightenment, ''Svoboda'' promoted the establishment of Ukrainian schools, the learning of Ukrainian language and history.<ref name="Petryshyn" />

At one time it had a [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of approximately 18,000, the largest among Ukrainian papers in the West.<ref name="EU" />
