'''WARM''' (590 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a [[radio station]] licensed to the [[city]] of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  The station is also known as "The True Oldies Station" with [[Oldies]] programming featuring music from 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  The station is currently owned by [[Cumulus Media]].  The station is a Class B [[AM broadcasting]] station according to the [[Federal Communications Commission]].  WARM broadcasts with a power of 5,000 [[watt]]s with two types of directional [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] signal patterns during daytime and nighttime.  The [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] patterns of the signal in both instances are generally aimed towards the southeast with some signal aimed towards the northwest from its transmitting [[Facility (telecommunications)|facility]] located 15 miles northwest of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] in [[Falls, Pennsylvania]].  WARM uses five, 495 feet high broadcasting towers to transmit its signal from that location. The station derives a portion of its programming from [[Scott Shannon]]'s [[The True Oldies Channel]] from [[Cumulus Media Networks]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Scott Shannon's True Oldies Channel |title=Radio Stations |url=http://www.trueoldieschannel.com/html/stations.html |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080728203304/http://www.trueoldieschannel.com/html/stations.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 28, 2008}}</ref>

==History==
WARM has a long and distinguished history in northeastern [[Pennsylvania]] broadcasting.  It was the predominant [[Top 40]] format music station in the area during the 1960s and into the 1970s.  It was known during this era as "The Mighty 590".<ref>[http://www.infoagepub.com/products/downloads/html/1-59311-111-8.php IAP: Information Age Publishing<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> WARM has held its original call sign since it signed on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] broadcast band in 1940.<ref>[http://members.aol.com/jeff99500/1949am.html U.
