The '''Four Corners Monument''' marks the [[quadripoint]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] where the states of [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] meet.  It is the only point in the United States shared by four states, leading to this area being called the [[Four Corners]] region.<ref name=explore4corners>{{cite web

The origins of the state boundaries marked by the monument occurred during the [[American Civil War]], when the [[United States Congress]] acted to form governments in the area to combat [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] ambitions for the region. Claims are sometimes made that the monument was misplaced in the initial surveys. The accuracy of the surveys has been defended by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] and the monument has been legally established as the corner of the four states.

The monument where "visitors can simultaneously straddle the territory of four states" is maintained as a [[tourist attraction]] by the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department.  Unlike many other attractions based on political boundaries, such as the [[Berlin Wall]], it is an example of a [[border|political boundary]] as a tourist destination for the sake of itself.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb8-1_timothy.pdf|last=Timothy|first=Dallen J.|date=Spring 2000|title=BORDERLANDS: An Unlikely Tourist Destination?|journal=Boundary and Security Bulletin|publisher=IBRU|volume=8|issue=1|format=PDF|pages=57<U+2013>65|accessdate=5-11-09}}</ref> The monument consists of a [[granite]] disk embedded with a smaller [[bronze]] disk around the point, surrounded by smaller, appropriately located state [[seal (emblem)|seals]] and flags representing both the states and tribal nations of the area. Circling the point, with two words in each state, the disk reads, "Four states here meet in freedom under God." Around the monument, local Navajo and Ute artisans sell souvenirs and food.  An admission fee is required to view and photograph the monument.<ref name=navajonation>{{cite web

In 2009, a spokesperson for the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]] admitted the monument is placed {{convert|1807|ft}} east of where modern surveyors would mark the point. However, he defended the accuracy of the 1875 survey, stating surveyors "nailed it" considering the primitive tools of the day. Pointing out the achievement given the conditions, he further stated, "Their ability to replicate that exact point <U+2014> what they did was phenomenal, what they did was spot on." He concluded by stating that any claims of errors in the location of the monument are irrelevant. Once a survey commissioned to establish a boundary has been accepted by the involved parties, the survey markers are legally binding, regardless of any error that is later discovered.<ref name=ap2>{{cite news

==History==
The area now called Four Corners was governed by [[Mexico]] following its independence from [[Spain]], until being [[Mexican Cession|ceded]] to the United States by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848.<ref name=treaty>{{cite web

|accessdate = 2009-05-09}}</ref> 
The location of the Four Corners Monument was effectively set in 1861 as the southwest corner of the [[Colorado Territory]] by the [[36th United States Congress]]. Congress transferred land previously allocated to the [[Utah Territory]] by declaring the boundary of Colorado to be the [[32nd meridian west from Washington]]. This line was derived from the reference used at the time, the [[Washington meridian]].<ref name=ColoradoTerritory>{{cite journal

In 1861, in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], a group of people in the southern portion of [[New Mexico Territory]] passed a resolution condemning the United States for creating a vast territory with only a single, small government in place at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. They claimed by doing so the U.S. had ignored the needs of the southern portion, left them without a functional system of law and order, and allowed the situation to deteriorate into a state of chaos and near anarchy.<ref name=lascruces>{{cite web

|title = History of Las Cruces:Confederate Territory of Arizona

|accessdate = 2009-05-09}}</ref> The group declared secession from the United States and announced their intent to join the [[Confederate States of America]] under the name of the [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]]. The U.S. Congress responded in 1863 by creating another [[Arizona Territory]] with different, but partially overlapping boundaries. The Confederate boundaries split New Mexico along an east<U+2013>west line, the [[34th parallel north]], allowing for a single state connection from [[Texas]] to the [[Colorado River]]. This would give the Confederacy access to [[California]] and the [[Pacific coast]]. The Union definition split New Mexico along a north<U+2013>south line, extending the boundaries established for Colorado. This created the [[quadripoint]] at the modern Four Corners <U+2013> with two territories separating California from Texas.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news

After the Civil War, efforts began to survey and create states from the earlier territories. The first survey of the line was made by E. N. Darling in 1868, and marked with a sandstone marker.<ref name=AThousandThings>{{cite book |last= Stimpson |first= George|title= A Book About A Thousand Things |publisher= [[Harper & Brothers]] |year= 1946 |isbn= 0760738033}}</ref> Another survey was completed in 1875 by Chandler Robbins, at which time the marker was moved to its current location.<ref name=navajo2/> The results of this survey were later accepted as the legal boundary when states were established from the earlier territories.<ref name=ap2/> The first permanent marker was placed at the site in 1912.
