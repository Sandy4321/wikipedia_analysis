'''Georgiou Kinkladze''' (born [[July 6]], [[1973]]), also known as '''Georgi''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/48/48207_the_modern_great__georgi_kinkladze.html|title=The modern great - Georgi Kinkladze |accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=Manchester Evening News }}</ref> '''Gio''' or '''Kinky''',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.lancashireeveningtelegraph.co.uk/1996/3/1/858075.html|title='Gio is the best of the lot' - says Lee |accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=Bolton Evening Telegraph }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/72327.stm|title=Kinky in Holland|accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> is a retired [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]]. A [[playmaker]], he first came to prominence with his performances for [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in the 1994<U+2013>95 season. He transferred to English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1995, where his dribbling ability and spectacular goals made him a cult hero, winning the club's Player of the Year award in consecutive seasons.

After enduring two [[promotion and relegation|relegations]] with City he joined [[Ajax Amsterdam]] in 1998, but did not settle and returned to England with [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] a little over a year later. He spent four years at Derby, making nearly 100 appearances. After leaving Derby in 2003 he became something of a [[journeyman footballer]], having trials at several clubs before joining Cypriot club [[Anorthosis Famagusta]] in 2005. He finished his career with Russian club [[Rubin Kazan]] in 2006.

==Early life==
Georgi Kinkladze was born on [[6 July]] [[1973]] in Tbilisi, Georgia, part of the former [[Soviet Union]]. As a child he lived in the Dedube district of the city with his father Robizon (an engineer), his mother Khatuna (a teacher) and his elder sister.<ref name="perfect10p26">{{cite book |last=Clayton |first=David |title=Kinkladze: The Perfect 10 |publisher=Parrs Wood |location=Manchester |date=2005 |id=ISBN 1-903158-60-5}} p26.</ref> Robizon was keen to see his son succeed as a footballer, sometimes making him walk around the family home on his knees to strengthen his legs, and enrolled him for [[Dynamo Tbilisi]]'s junior side when he was only six years old.<ref name="perfect10p26"/> Khatuna disapproved of some of her husband's methods, instead taking Georgi to lessons in ''[[Dances of Georgia|mtiulur]]'', a traditional Georgian ballet.<ref name="UEFA">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=8/newsid=383001.html|title=Kinkladze reborn at Rubin |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=UEFA }}</ref> 

When Georgian football formed leagues independent of Soviet competition in 1989, Kinkladze joined [[Mretebi Tbilisi]],  the first openly professional club in the Soviet Union.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p20.</ref> In his first professional season, aged 16, Kinkladze played 20 games. After a second season at Mretebi he was signed by Dinamo, the team he represented as a youth, for one million roubles.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p31.</ref> In 1991, Georgia became an independent state again, but independence brought [[Georgian civil war|civil war]] as rival factions fought for control. As the hostilities continued, in 1993 the Tbilisi management sought to put their players in a more stable environment. As part of this Kinkladze was sent on a six month loan to [[1. FC Saarbr<U+00FC>cken|Saarbr<U+00FC>cken]] in Germany.<ref name="Perfect 10 p32">Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p32.</ref>

==Career in Georgia==
None of the Georgians were able to settle into the side at Saarbr<U+00FC>cken, and following Saarbr<U+00FC>cken's relegation Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi. By now he was a regular in the Georgian national side, having made his international debut against [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] in 1992,<ref name="Perfect 10 p32"/> and in 1993<U+2013>94 he was the national Player of the Year.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p33.</ref> Dinamo president Merad Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to [[Atletico Madrid]] for approximately <U+00A3>200,000; they gave him a trial but no contract. He then trained with [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]'s reserves, where he caught the eye of [[Club Atl<U+00E9>tico Boca Juniors|Boca Juniors]] scouts, who took him to [[Argentina]] for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero [[Diego Maradona]], but did not gain a permanent contract, as coach [[Silvio Marzolini]] regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker [[Alberto M<U+00E1>rcico]].<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p32<U+2013>33.</ref>

In September 1994 [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] played [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] in Tbilisi. Footage of Kinkladze's performance resulted in interest from clubs in Italy, where the press nicknamed Kinkladze the ''[[Gianni Rivera|Rivera]] of the Black Sea'', but no concrete attempts to sign him took place. It was not until Manchester City chairman [[Francis Lee]] witnessed the recording that negotiations for a permanent move abroad occurred. Enthused by Kinkladze's display, Lee contacted Jordania, securing an agreement that Manchester City would have first refusal should Dinamo wish to sell the player.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p35<U+2013>36.</ref>

Two months later, Kinkladze scored his first international goal as Georgia thrashed [[Wales national football team|Wales]] 5<U+2013>0. At the return match at [[Cardiff Arms Park]], scouts from several clubs saw Kinkladze score the only goal of the game with a 20 yard chip over [[Neville Southall]] as part of a man of the match display. In his last season with Dinamo, Kinkladze had scored 14 goals in 20 outings, and clubs from several countries expressed interest in signing him. Jordania kept true to his agreement with Lee, and on 15 July 1995 Kinkladze signed for Manchester City, becoming [[Alan Ball]]'s first signing for the club, the fee generally reported as <U+00A3>2 million.<ref name="Everything">{{cite book |last=Clayton |first=David |title=Everything under the blue moon: the complete book of Manchester City FC - and more! |publisher=Mainstream publishing |location=Edinburgh |date=2002 |id=ISBN 1-84018-687-9}} p122</ref> After initial difficulties obtaining a work permit, Kinkladze played his first match for  Manchester City against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Spurs]] on [[19 August]] [[1995]].<ref name="Complete Record">{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City - The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |date=2006 |id=ISBN 1-85983-512-0}} p224<U+2013>5</ref>

==Manchester City==
Manchester City's form stuttered during the [[1995-96 in English football|1995<U+2013>96 season]], failing to win a single game in the first three months of the season, but Kinkladze quickly became a terrace hero.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Andy |coauthors=Burgess, Richard |title=Blue Moon Rising: The Fall and Rise of Manchester City |publisher=Milo |location=Bury |date=2000 |id=ISBN 0-9530847-4-4}} p101</ref> When the first win ,against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], finally arrived, it was Kinkladze who scored the winner following a [[:wikt:one-two|one-two]] with [[Niall Quinn]]. Kinkladze was initially homesick, and struggled to speak English. In an effort to resolve his homesickness, his mother moved to Manchester to provide him with familiar food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,110666,00.html |title=Kinkladze back to his old tricks |accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Guardian }}</ref> By the time Manchester City travelled to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in December, press and supporters touted Kinkladze as the star player of the Manchester City side. The match against Middlesbrough was billed as a contest between Kinkladze and the Brazilian playmaker [[Juninho Paulista|Juninho]]. Kinkladze scored the opening goal with a solo effort, but the match ended 4<U+2013>1 to Middlesbrough. However the Middlesbrough fans subsequently voted Kinkladze the "Best Opposing Player of the Season".<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p59<U+2013>60,</ref>

He became a favourite of the City fans and scored 22 goals in 119 appearances. In March 1996 he scored a particularly spectacular goal against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. Kinkladze beat five players before chipping Southampton goalkeeper [[Dave Beasant]].<ref name="Everything"/>  The goal won [[Match of the Day]]'s "Goal of the Month", and placed second in the programme's "Goal of the Season" competition.<ref name="Complete Record"/>

On the final day of the season, Manchester City were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to Division One, prompting transfer speculation linking Kinkladze to a number of clubs including [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name="Everything"/> However, he instead opted to stay at Manchester City, where he had been named Player of the Year for 1995<U+2013>96.<ref name="handbook">{{cite book |last=Baskcomb |first=Julian (ed.) |title=Manchester City F.C. Official Handbook 1997-98 |publisher=Polar |location=Leicester |year=1997}} p87</ref> The 1996<U+2013>97 season proved a turbulent one for Manchester City, and over the course of the season Kinkladze played for five different managers. With [[Keith Curle]] no longer at the club, Kinkladze became the main [[penalty kick|penalty]] taker,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/48/48206_fact_file.html |title=Fact File |accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> and also scored a number of goals from free-kicks, including a 35-yard effort against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] described by the [[Manchester Evening News]] as "like a missile".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_city/s/49/49299_citys_goalden_moments.html |title=City's Goalden Moments |accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> In the First Division Kinkladze frequently had two or even three opposing players assigned to [[man marking|man mark]] him. Several teams chose to combat Kinkladze's playmaking skill with robust tackles; in one such match against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] Kinkladze had to be stretchered off following a challenge by [[David Hopkin]].<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p96</ref> Manchester City finished the season well below the promotion places, and again there was speculation that Kinkladze would leave the club. On the final day of the season the supporters used the match against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] to campaign to keep Kinkladze at the club, even though he was not playing in the match due to injury.<ref>Blue Moon Rising, p143</ref> The campaign even extended to the half-time adverts on the scoreboard, the "adverts" being messages from supporter groups who had paid to display them.<ref name="handbook"/> Kinkladze was named Player of the Year for the second consecutive season,<ref name="handbook"/> and one month after the season ended he announced his intention to stay at the club by signing a new three-year contract.

Manchester City's freefall continued in [[1997-98 in English football|1997<U+2013>98]], and in February 1999 manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement [[Joe Royle]] had a reputation for playing defensive midfielders, which had led to his [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] team being nicknamed the "Dogs of War".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/2367795.stm |title=Ipswich's Royle command |accessdate=2007-11-02 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager he opened proceedings with the words "We have to sell Kinkladze".<ref name="rising157">Blue Moon Rising, p157</ref> After playing the first two games under Royle, Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at a muddy [[Vale Park]] on 14 March. [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] defeated City 2<U+2013>1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games.<ref>Blue Moon Rising, p158</ref> In 2005 Royle explained his view in his autobiography: "To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me he was a big negative. I am not saying that City's ills were all down to Kinkladze but there was too much about the whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right... ...too often since his arrival the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion he would be my weak link not my strong one."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/s/177/177336_royle_why_kinkladze_had_to_go.html |title=Royle: Why Kinkladze had to go|accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. The QPR team contained hardman [[Vinnie Jones]], who targeted Kinkladze from the outset, even in the tunnel before the start of the match.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p124</ref> Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but calamitous defending including a freak [[own goal]] from [[Jamie Pollock]] meant the match ended in a 2<U+2013>2 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980427/ai_n14159649 |title=Lap of dishonour as City farce plays on|accessdate=2007-12-06 |publisher=Independent}}</ref> City no longer controlled their own fate, and were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day win against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]].<ref>Blue Moon Rising, p164</ref>

==Ajax==
Following transfer negotiations which had been ongoing in the final months of the season, Kinkladze left Manchester City for Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] for a <U+00A3>5 million transfer fee. However, Kinkladze's spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful. He was originally signed as a replacement for [[Jari Litmanen]], but Litmanen stayed at Ajax as his proposed move to Barcelona fell through. As a result Kinkladze played in an unfamiliar left-wing position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19991205/ai_n14497367 |title=Kinky: Jim saved me from Ajax agony |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=Sunday Mirror }}</ref> His league debut for Ajax came in a 2<U+2013>0 win against [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] on [[23 August]], [[1998]],<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p136</ref> but starts were a rare occurrence. To compound matters, coach [[Morten Olsen]] was sacked early in the season, and a disagreement with replacement [[Jan Wouters]] resulted in Kinkladze losing his place in the team.<ref name="Indy1">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991228/ai_n14272202 |title=Derby pray for second coming of Kinkladze |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=Independent }}</ref>

Having failed to established himself in the first team and struggling with a succession of injuries, Kinkladze made just 12 appearances for Ajax in his first season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajaxf-side.nl/nieuws/2005/1012watdoettienauw_kinkladze.htm |title=Wat doet tie nauw?!: Georgi Kinkladze, 'The Georgian Maestro' |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=The Ajax/F-side page}}{{nl icon}}</ref> He was not even issued a squad number for his second season,<ref name="Indy1"/> when he was made to train with the reserve team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nieuwsbank.nl/inp/2000/04/0419G092.htm |title= Ajax-speler Kinkladze definitief naar Derby |accessdate=2007-11-11 |publisher=Nieuwsbank}}{{nl icon}}</ref> His lack of regular football also resulted in him losing his place in the Georgian national team.<ref name="Indy1"/> In September 1999 he held transfer talks with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], but no move materialised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19990923/ai_n14240633 |title=Blades' bold bid to capture Kinkladze |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=Independent }}</ref> Two months later a return to England was secured in the form of a loan move to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19991102/ai_n14267325 |title=Kinkladze returns to Premiership in Derby loan deal |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=Independent }}</ref>

==Derby County==
As Kinkladze was not playing regular international football at the time, he was not automatically entitled to a work permit, but a review panel gave him special dispensation due to his previous contribution to English football.<ref name="Indy1"/> His Derby debut came as a substitute against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on [[28 November]] [[1999]]. The move was made permanent at the end of the season, the transfer fee <U+00A3>3 million,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/872483.stm |title=Derby aim for survival |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> which was a club record until 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2115120,00.html |title=Derby snap up <U+00A3>3.5m Earnshaw |accessdate=2007-11-03 |publisher=Guardian }}</ref>  Kinkladze missed the start of the [[2000-01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01 season]] due to a hernia operation.<ref name="DET1">{{cite web |url=http://www.therams.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&key=2941%7C0%7C2C27065867207%7CR%7C706%7C128722872004504456131&parentkey=2941%7C0%7C2C27065867207%7Cp%7C706%7C0 |title=Kinkladze, Giorgi |accessdate=2007-11-04 |publisher=Derby Evening Telegraph }}</ref> He returned to the side as a substitute against Middlesbrough on [[6 September]], [[2000]]. With Derby 3<U+2013>0 down, Kinkladze and [[Malcolm Christie]] were introduced in a double substitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/912672.stm |title=Derby stage comeback to earn point|accessdate=2007-11-04 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> The pair then proved influential as Derby came back to draw the match 3<U+2013>3.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p157</ref> Over the next four months Kinkladze was sometimes a starter and sometimes a substitute, rotating with [[Stefano Eranio]], until a groin injury sustained in the return match with Middlesbrough kept him out for two months.<ref name="DET1"/> Derby struggled for most of the season, but avoided relegation. A similar pattern of starts and substitute appearances followed at the start of the [[2001-02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02 season]], but the resignation of Derby manager [[Jim Smith (footballer)|Jim Smith]] in October 2001 signalled a change in the club's playing style. New manager [[Colin Todd]] did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p165</ref> Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took the unusual step of using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/derby-county-fc/news/88179/Frustrated+Kinkladze+drafts+in+lawyer.html |title=Frustrated Kinkladze Drafts in Lawyer|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher=4thegame }}</ref> Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/1749114.stm |title=Kinkladze put up for sale|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> However, Todd was sacked in January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/derby_county/1760471.stm |title=Derby sack Todd|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation for the third time in his career. 

The start of the [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03 season]] saw Kinkladze miss a number of matches through injuries, featuring in around half of Derby's games in the remainder of 2002. Kinkladze played more often in the second half of the season, and his form resulted in him being named the supporters player of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therams.co.uk/details.asp?key=1C28%7C0%7C2E47404879312%7Cp%7C740%7C0 |title=Players of the Year |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=Derby Evening Telegraph }}</ref> Derby finished the season in the bottom half of the table, and needed to reduce costs for the next season as their Premier League "parachute payments" had ended. As a result Derby offered Kinkladze a one-year contract, but on considerably lower wages than his previous contract. Failing to agree terms, he decided to leave the club.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.therams.co.uk/details.asp?back=true&key=2941%7C0%7C2C27065867207%7CR%7C706%7C128722872004504456131&parentkey=2941%7C0%7C2C27065867207%7Cp%7C706%7C0 |title=Kinky's star rarely shone |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=Derby Evening Telegraph }}</ref>

Without a club during pre-season, Kinkladze trained with [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], where his former manager Jim Smith was on the coaching staff. He played for Portsmouth in one pre-season friendly, but Portsmouth decided to sign another former Manchester City playmaker, [[Eyal Berkovic]], instead.<ref>Kinkladze: The Perfect 10, p177</ref> Over the next few months he was linked with moves to Scottish clubs [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] and Celtic, and later [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], but nothing came of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/3144342.stm |title=Dundee end Kinkladze bid |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=BBC }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2003/06/25/sfncel25.xml |title= Kinkladze keen on Celtic move |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/3396783.stm |title=Kinkladze on show for Leeds |accessdate=2007-10-21 |publisher=BBC }}</ref> His spell without a club came to an end in January 2005, when his former international team-mate [[Temuri Ketsbaia]] offered him a contract at Cypriot team [[Anorthosis Famagusta]], where he was player-coach.<ref name="UEFA">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/magazine/news/kind=8/newsid=383001.html|title=Kinkladze reborn at Rubin |accessdate=2007-10-20 |publisher=UEFA }}</ref> After helping Anorthosis win the Cypriot championship, his contract came to an end, but Famagusta managed to extend it for another year.
