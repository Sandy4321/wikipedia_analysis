'''''The Late Late Toy Show''''' is an annual influential [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] institution, an edition of the world's longest-running<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1128|title=Dima performs at The Late Late Show|date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=[[Eurovision]]}}</ref><ref>Questions are sometimes raised over whether ''The Tonight Show'' on US television, which began broadcasting in 1954, should be described as the longest running. However there is little continuity between the show launched in 1954 and the current format, with the show existing under different guises and names ('Tonight' and 'Tonight! America after Dark' are just two of its names in its early years). The show in its different formats ran as a variety show, then as a news show that was modelled on breakfast show, before adopting the current format and the name ''The Tonight Show'' when [[Johnny Carson]] took over as permanent presenter in October 1962, some months after ''The Late Late Show'' was launched. Having kept the same name and format continuously, ''The Late Late Show'' is perceived in the media as more entitled to the term "the longest running show".</ref> [[Talk show|chat show]], ''[[The Late Late Show]]'' broadcast on [[RT<U+00C9> One]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] each Friday evening. ''The Toy Show'', as it is referred to, is broadcast in late November or early December each year. It is regularly the most watched programme of the year on Irish television, with viewership figures rising steadily in recent years. The show, which is comprised of an adult-only studio audience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/toy-show-is-just-childs-play-for-pat-1556179.html|title=Toy Show is just child's play for Pat|date=2006-11-28|accessdate=2008-12-15|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> dressed in traditional Christmas attire, does not accept advertisements which promote toys for its commercial breaks but, whilst new gadget-type toys regularly break down during the live show, being featured on the programme itself has been said to have a major boost to sales of a product over the following number of weeks in the build-up to the Christmas period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/media--marketing-new-rules-for-fast-food-ads-leave-sour-taste-in-producers-mouths-71059.html|title=Media & Marketing: New rules for fast food ads leave sour taste in producers' mouths|date=2006-12-30|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

Currently presented by the show's regular host, [[Pat Kenny]], the show has previously been presented by [[Gay Byrne]] during his tenure at the helm. Byrne habitually wore a Christmas jumper each year, but Kenny has tended to wear a "naff" grey jumper in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/party-through-the-pain-1574359.html|title=Party through the pain|date=2006-12-14|accessdate=2008-11-15|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> [[Dustin the Turkey]], a high-profile entertainment figure in Ireland, makes an annual appearance, usually bringing a gift for the presenter. These gifts when produced tend to have a comedy effect and in the past have included a miniature antique chair and a Pat Kenny clock, ominously presented to Kenny's predecessor Gay Byrne. The 2008 edition was broadcast on [[RT<U+00C9> One]] on 28 November 2008 at 21:35.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/toyshow.html "Toy Show ticket applications are now closed."]. RT<U+00C9>.

== History ==
{{Expand|date=November 2008}}
In 1997, Dustin presented Gay Byrne with a miniature antique chair during the veteran presenter's second-last Toy Show. The stunt alluded to a controversy that occurred when the winner of an antiques restoration competition run by the show claimed credit for a chair which had been worked on by another person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/gaybo-bullied-me-in-chair-row-siubhan-456112.html|title=Gaybo bullied me in chair row: Siubhan|date=1998-02-27|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

==== 2005 edition ====
The 2005 Toy Show was broadcast on 2 December 2005, attracting 1.1 million viewers as the most watched programme on Irish television that year. It was also the most watched edition of ''The Late Late Show'' since Gay Byrne's final show in 1999. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/toy-show-was-top-of-the-box-with-2005-viewers-115977.html|title=Toy Show was top of the box with 2005 viewers|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

==== 2006 edition ====
The 2006 Toy Show was broadcast on 1 December 2006. Six-year-old Millie (Philomena) Murray, who, along with her four-year-old brother Gavin Murray, had recently been burned out of her car in [[Limerick]], left her hospital bed to make an appearance. She requested a doll to play with for the show. Her brother was too unwell to feature on the show after the incident that led to over twelve weeks of hospital treatment for the pair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/late-late-toy-show-treat-for-car-arson-victim-millie-70229.html|title=Late, Late Toy Show treat for car arson victim Millie|date=2006-11-24|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> Pat Kenny was later criticised in a study by the [[Equality Authority]] for his hosting of the show, in which he persistently reinforced stereotypes of [[Sexual script#gender roles|gender role]]s. An example was a human skull shown to ooze [[Gunge|slime]], of which the presenter uttered the comment "made for boys, I think".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/education/latest-news/childrens-world-is-pink-and-blue-says-survey-1209556.html|title=Children's world is pink and blue, says survey|date=2007-11-02|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

The 2007 Toy Show was broadcast on 30 November 2007, attracting over one million viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/05/18/story32977.asp|title=RTE seeks new deal for Late Late Show|date=2008-05-18|accessdate=2008-11-24|publisher=''[[The Sunday Business Post]]''}}</ref> or seven tenths of the available audience, making it the most watched television programme in Ireland at that time of 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/entertainment/mhmhsnaugboj/|title='Late Late Toy Show' tops annual ratings|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2008-11-24|publisher=BreakingNews.ie}}</ref> Broadcast over the traditional four parts, it contained a performance from [[James Blunt]], the annual appearance of Dustin, book reviews and Miriam O'Shea who performed a rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over the Rainbow]]". The 2007 Toy Show also played host to an interview with comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Kenny expressed a lack of knowledge about his subject from the very beginning when he introduced him as "Jerry Sein''field''". There was much uncomfortable chat on the topic of bees (Seinfeld was on the show to promote his new movie, ''[[Bee Movie]]'') and Kenny then presented him with a cheap imitation of his favourite superhero, [[Superman]]. Seinfeld, who had previously lashed out at [[Larry King]] over his ignorance, remained tight-lipped and walked off without informing Kenny of his correct name. <ref>"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk1EOcFv3s8 Pat Kenny vs Jerry Seinfeld - Toy Show]". Accessed 24 october 2008.</ref> The 2007 Toy Show was opened by the soprano Ois<U+00ED>n Nolan who ascended a hanging crescent moon as Kenny entered the studio fresh from his visit to Santa in Lapland. The show was closed by The Wexford Singers.

The 2008 Toy Show aired on 28 November 2008 and was Pat Kenny's tenth Toy Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/1128/rtechristmas.html|title=The Countdown to Christmas begins at RT<U+00C9>|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-11-28|publisher=[[Radio Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref> It achieved a total audience of 1,199,000 to become the most viewed television programme across all channels available in Ireland since 2001. It was the fourth consecutive year that the show cleared the one million viewers mark, with 275,000 of those watching being children and almost 800,000 watchers being adults.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/pats-toy-show-attracts-record-12-million-viewers-1560012.html|title=Pat's 'Toy Show' attracts record 1.2 million viewers|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-15|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref>

The programme proved controversial, with controversy beginning to generate one week before broadcast, when the current value of tickets was questioned. When a competition winner refused two tickets to the show as her prize at the end of the 21 November edition of ''The Late Late Show'', visibly infuriated presenter Pat Kenny tore them up live on air. Kenny questioned why she had entered the competition if she had not wanted to attend the Toy Show (the tickets were just part of the prize; also on offer was <U+20AC>10,000). In the aftermath, the winner, identified as Barbara Heavey from [[Cork (city)|Cork]], explained to a newspaper that she had entered the competition "out of boredom", had "no interest in watching children play with toys for two hours" and had no children of her own. She did not see the actual tearing of the tickets as she had turned off the television "to prevent an echo on the line" and attempted to suggest that they either be raffled or donated to someone else only to be drowned out by Kenny and his audience's vocal disbelief. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/rte-viewers-raise-hell-over-late-late-satanic-show-1550830.html|title=RTE viewers raise hell over Late Late 'Satanic' show|date=2008-11-24|accessdate=2008-11-25|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> Despite numerous attempts by RT<U+00C9> to have her attend, she said she would be "bored stiff", wasn't interested in toys and, if she had to attend the show, would probably "set off the smoke alarms by chain-smoking in the toilets".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/id-be-bored-stiff-says-winner-of-toy-show-tickets-1552763.html|title=I'd be bored stiff, says winner of Toy Show tickets|date=2008-11-26|accessdate=2008-12-15|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}</ref> Kenny did not let the matter rest however, opening his morning radio show the following Monday with a five minute chat to his listeners in which he implied that the torn-up tickets were of more value than [[All-Ireland final]] and [[Munster v. All Blacks]] tickets. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplesrepublicofcork.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=785|title=Late Late Show Slur on Cork Woman

Two and a half hours before the 2008 Toy Show got underway Kenny appeared on [[Aidan Power]]'s ''[[The Cafe (chat show)|The Cafe]]'' with alter-ego [[Oliver Callan]]. (19:00). Kenny revealed [[McFly]] would perform, the only guest he was willing to reveal to Power. Power then mimicked the torn ticket incident by teasing Kenny with two tickets before plucking them from his grasp and tearing them into pieces, after which Kenny engaged in some turkey dialogue with the rest of ''The Cafe''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/1128/thecafe.html|title=Pat Kenny to join Aidan on The Caf<U+00E9>|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-11-28|publisher=[[Radio Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann|RT<U+00C9>]]}}</ref> In an announcement aired before the [[RT<U+00C9> News: Nine O'Clock|Nine O'Clock News]], Kenny let slip that [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Richard Hammond]] and [[James May]] from BBC's ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' would appear. During the show, Kenny once again referenced the ticket fiasco when, whilst promoting another competition with a prize of a car and <U+20AC>10,000, he said he would "tear up" the vehicle if the winner refused to take it. [[Nicky Byrne]] of [[Westlife]] appeared with his twins Rocco and Jay and met 10-year-old Shauna Byrne, a fan of his who was battling [[cystic fibrosis]] at the time but later died on 30 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/westlifes-nicky-mourns-his-bravest-fan-1624075.html|title=Westlife's Nicky mourns his bravest fan|date=2009-02-02|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=''[[Evening Herald]]''}}</ref> Sarah Ferguson was present for the annual children's book section, where she listened to some of the children speak the [[Irish language]]. McFly, in their second Toy Show appearance, performed "[[Do Ya/Stay With Me|Do Ya]]" from their ''[[Radio:Active|Radioactive]]'' album. The closing act was [[RT<U+00C9> C<U+00F3>r na n<U+00D3>g]], singing [[Jingle Bells]]. <ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/20081128.html "Friday, 28 November 2008"]. RT<U+00C9>.
