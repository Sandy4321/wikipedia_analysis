In a September 2008 interview, ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' director Abrams said of Quinto's performance as Spock: "Zachary brought a gravity and an incredible sense of humor, which is a wonderful combination because Spock's character is deceivingly complicated. The revelation for me watching the movie, when I finally got to watch the whole thing after working on sequences, was that he is extraordinary. He was doing things I didn't even realize while we were shooting <U+2013> these amazing things to track his story."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/J.J.+Abrams+on+TV%27s+Fringe/ | title=J.J.
