Upon its release, ''Testimony'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music criticism|music critics]]. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 79, which indicates "generally positive reviews", based on 5 reviews.<ref name="metacritic1">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/testimony/august-alsina |title=Testimony <U+2013> August Alsina |publisher=[[MetaCritic]] |accessdate=2014-06-25}}</ref> Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] said, "Throughout, Alsina is joined by the likes of Young Jeezy, Pusha T, Fabolous, and Rick Ross, and though he's a natural match with most of them, he could have carried the whole album on his own with ease. This is a gratifying second step from one of the most exciting contemporary R&B artists to appear during the 2010s."<ref name="allmusic1"/>

Erin Lowers of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave the album an L rating, saying "In comparison to several R&B records released this year, August Alsina offers an honesty in his music related directly to his life. He<U+2019>s neither afraid to rejoice in his accomplishments nor is he scared to speak on his mistakes. Finding the balance between sex, love, and ratchet, ''Testimony'' is truly a testament to a new era in R&B that shifts safe lyrics to smooth street tales."<ref name="xxlmag1"/> Brandon Soderberg of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "Usually, in-the-pocket R&B does fine with middling MCs, but ''Testimony'', powered by Alsina's insider-outsider personality -- sensitive romantic with a crime-haunted past -- doesn't need these big dumb lugs for cred, or even menace. ''Testimony'' brings rap's raw nerve detail to the sturdy slow jam, nullifying the need for nods to R&B of the "rap and bullshit" variety."<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
