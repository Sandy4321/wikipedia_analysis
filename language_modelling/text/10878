{{infobox bohrium}}
'''Bohrium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Bh''' and [[atomic number]] 107, named in honor of [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. It is a [[synthetic element]] (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and [[radioactive]]; the most stable known [[isotope]], <sup>270</sup>Bh, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 61&nbsp;seconds.

In the [[periodic table (standard)|periodic table]] of the elements, it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7|7th period]] and belongs to the [[group 7 elements]]. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that bohrium behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[rhenium]] in group 7. The chemical properties of bohrium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 7 elements.

==History==
[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The element 107 was originally proposed to be named after [[Niels Bohr]] (left side), a [[Denmark|Danish]] nuclear physicist, with the name ''nielsbohrium'' (Ns). This name was later changed by [[IUPAC]] to ''bohrium'' (Bh).]]
===Official discovery===
Bohrium was first convincingly [[discovery of the chemical elements|synthesized]] in 1981 by a German research team led by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried M<U+00FC>nzenberg]] at the [[Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Schwerionenforschung|Institute for Heavy Ion Research]] (Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Schwerionenforschung) in [[Darmstadt]]. The team bombarded a target of [[bismuth-209]] with accelerated nuclei of [[chromium]]-54 to produce 5 atoms of the [[isotope]] bohrium-262:<ref name="262Bh">{{cite journal |last1=M<U+00FC>nzenberg |first1=G. |last2=Hofmann |first2=S. |last3=He<U+00DF>berger |first3=F.

===Proposed names===
The German group suggested the name ''nielsbohrium'' with symbol ''Ns'' to honor the Danish physicist [[Niels Bohr]]. The Soviet scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia had suggested this name be given to element 105 (which was finally called [[dubnium]]) and the German team wished to recognise both Bohr and the fact that the Dubna team had been the first to propose the cold fusion reaction to solve the controversial problem of the naming of element 105. The Dubna team agreed with the German group's naming proposal for element 107.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ghiorso |first1=A. |last2=Seaborg |first2=G. T. |last3=Oganessian |first3=Yu.

There was an [[element naming controversy]] as to what the elements from 104 to 106 were to be called; the [[IUPAC]] adopted ''unnilseptium'' (symbol ''Uns'') as a temporary, [[systematic element name]] for this element.<ref name=IUPAC97>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199769122471|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1997)|year=1997|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=69|pages=2471|issue=12}}</ref> In 1994 a committee of IUPAC recommended that element 107 be named ''bohrium'', not ''nielsbohrium'', since there was no precedence for using a scientist's complete name in the naming of an element.<ref name=IUPAC97/><ref name=IUPAC94>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199466122419|title=Names and symbols of transfermium elements (IUPAC Recommendations 1994)|year=1994|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=66|pages=2419|issue=12}}</ref> This was opposed by the discoverers as there was some concern that the name might be confused with [[boron]] and in particular the distinguishing of the names of their respective [[oxoanion]]s, ''bohrate'' and ''borate''. The matter was handed to the Danish branch of IUPAC which, despite this, voted in favour of the name ''bohrium'', and thus the name ''bohrium'' for element 107 was recognized internationally in 1997. The IUPAC subsequently decided that bohrium salts should be called ''bohriates'' instead of ''bohrates''.<ref name=IUPAC97/>

==Nucleosynthesis==
{{main|Isotopes of bohrium}}
[[Super-heavy element]]s such as bohrium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in [[particle accelerator]]s that induce [[fusion reaction]]s. Whereas most of the isotopes of bohrium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher [[atomic number]]s.<ref name=AM89>{{Cite journal |first=Peter |last=Armbruster |lastauthoramp=yes|first2=Gottfried|last2=M<U+00FC>nzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36<U+2013>42 |year=1989}}</ref>

Depending on the energies involved, the former are separated into "hot" and "cold". In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets ([[actinide]]s), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40<U+2013>50 [[electronvolt|MeV]]) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons.<ref name=fusion>{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Robert C. |last2=G<U+00E4>ggeler |first2=Heinz W. |last3=Karol |first3=Paul J. |last4=Nakahara |first4=Hiromichi |last5=Vardaci |first5=Emanuele |last6=Vogt |first6=Erich |title=Discovery of the element with atomic number 112 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=7 |page=1331 |year=2009 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-08-03-05}}</ref> In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10<U+2013>20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the [[ground state]], they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products.<ref name=AM89>{{Cite journal |first=Peter |last=Armbruster |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Gottfried |last2=Munzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36<U+2013>42 |year=1989}}</ref> The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see [[cold fusion]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |year=1989 |title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium |journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=301<U+2013>308 |doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 }}</ref>

===Cold fusion===
Before the first successful synthesis of hassium in 1981 by the GSI team, the synthesis of bohrium was first attempted in 1976 by scientists at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] at [[Dubna]] using this cold fusion reaction. They detected two [[spontaneous fission]] activities, one with a [[half-life]] of 1-2&nbsp;ms and one with a half-life of 5&nbsp;s. Based on the results of other cold fusion reactions, they concluded that they were due to <sup>261</sup>Bh and <sup>257</sup>Db respectively. However, later evidence gave a much lower SF branching for <sup>261</sup>Bh reducing confidence in this assignment. The assignment of the dubnium activity was later changed to <sup>258</sup>Db, presuming that the decay of bohrium was missed. The 2 ms SF activity was assigned to <sup>258</sup>Rf resulting from the 33% [[electron capture|EC]] branch.<ref name=93TWG/> The GSI team studied the reaction in 1981 in their discovery experiments. Five atoms of <sup>262</sup>Bh were detected using the method of correlation of genetic parent-daughter decays.<ref name="262Bh"/> In 1987, an internal report from Dubna indicated that the team had been able to detect the [[spontaneous fission]] of <sup>261</sup>Bh directly. The GSI team further studied the reaction in 1989 and discovered the new isotope <sup>261</sup>Bh during the measurement of the 1n and 2n excitation functions but were unable to detect an SF branching for <sup>261</sup>Bh.<ref name="261Bh">{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01565147|title=Element 107|year=1989|author=M<U+00FC>nzenberg, G.|journal=Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Physik A|volume=333|pages=163|last2=Armbruster|first2=P.|last3=Hofmann|first3=S.|last4=He<U+00DF>berger|first4=F.

The 1n excitation function was remeasured in 2005 by the team at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (LBNL) after some doubt about the accuracy of previous data. They observed 18 atoms of <sup>262</sup>Bh and 3 atoms of <sup>261</sup>Bh and confirmed the two isomers of <sup>262</sup>Bh.<ref>[http://rnc.lbl.gov/nsd/annualreport2005/contributions/Nelson_LE.pdf "Entrance Channel Effects in the Production of <sup>262,261</sup>Bh"], Nelson et al., ''LBNL repositories 2005''. Retrieved on 2008-03-04</ref>

In 2007, the team at LBNL studied the analogous reaction with chromium-52 projectiles for the first time to search for the lightest bohrium isotope <sup>260</sup>Bh:

:{{Nuclide|Link|bismuth|209}} + {{Nuclide|Link|chromium|52}} <U+2192> {{Nuclide|Link|bohrium|260}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|neutron}}

The team successfully detected 8 atoms of <sup>260</sup>Bh decaying by [[alpha decay]] to <sup>256</sup>Db, emitting alpha particles with energy 10.16&nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]. The alpha decay energy indicates the continued stabilizing effect of the [[neutron number|N]]=152 closed shell.<ref name="260Bh">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=S.|last2=Gregorich|first2=K.|last3=Dragojevi<U+0107>|first3=I.|last4=Garcia|first4=M.|last5=Gates|first5=J.|last6=Sudowe|first6=R.|last7=Nitsche|first7=H.|title=Lightest Isotope of Bh Produced via the Bi209(Cr52,n)Bh260 Reaction|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=100|year=2008|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.022501|issue=2|bibcode=2008PhRvL.100b2501N}}</ref>

The team at Dubna also studied the reaction between [[lead]]-208 targets and [[manganese]]-55 projectiles in 1976 as part of their newly established cold fusion approach to new elements:

:{{Nuclide|Link|lead|208}} + {{Nuclide|Link|manganese|55}} <U+2192> {{Nuclide|Link|bohrium|262}} + {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|neutron}}

They observed the same spontaneous fission activities as those observed in the reaction between bismuth-209 and chromium-54 and again assigned them to <sup>261</sup>Bh and <sup>257</sup>Db. Later evidence indicated that these should be reassigned to <sup>258</sup>Db and <sup>258</sup>Rf (see above).<ref name=93TWG/> In 1983, they repeated the experiment using a new technique: measurement of alpha decay from a [[decay product]] that had been separated out chemically. The team were able to detect the alpha decay from a decay product of <sup>262</sup>Bh, providing some evidence for the formation of bohrium nuclei.<ref name=93TWG/> This reaction was later studied in detail using modern techniques by the team at LBNL. In 2005 they measured 33 decays of <sup>262</sup>Bh and 2 atoms of <sup>261</sup>Bh, providing an [[excitation function]] for the reaction emitting one [[neutron]] and some spectroscopic data of both <sup>262</sup>Bh isomers. The excitation function for the reaction emitting two neutrons was further studied in a 2006 repeat of the reaction. The team found that the reaction emitting one neutron had a higher [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] than the corresponding reaction with a <sup>209</sup>Bi target, contrary to expectations. Further research is required to understand the reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Excitation function for the production of <sup>262</sup>Bh (Z=107) in the odd-Z-projectile reaction <sup>208</sup>Pb(<sup>55</sup>Mn, n)|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.73.014611|year=2006|author=Folden Iii, C.

===Hot fusion===
The reaction between [[uranium-238]] targets and [[phosphorus]]-31 projectiles was first studied in 2006 at the LBNL as part of their systematic study of fusion reactions using uranium-238 targets:

Results have not been published but preliminary results appear to indicate the observation of [[spontaneous fission]], possibly from <sup>264</sup>Bh.<ref>[http://www-wnt.gsi.de/tasca06/images/contributions/TASCA_06_Gates.pdf Hot fusion studies at the BGS with light projectiles and 238U targets], J. M. Gates</ref>

Recently, the team at the [[Institute of Modern Physics]] (IMP), [[Lanzhou]], have studied the nuclear reaction between [[americium-243]] targets and accelerated nuclei of [[magnesium]]-26 in order to synthesise the new isotope <sup>265</sup>Bh and gather more data on <sup>266</sup>Bh:

The reaction between targets of [[curium]]-248 and accelerated nuclei of [[sodium]]-23 was studied for the first time in 2008 by the team at RIKEN, Japan, in order to study the decay properties of <sup>266</sup>Bh, which is a decay product in their claimed decay chains of [[ununtrium]]:<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=0904.1093 |doi=10.1143/JPSJ.78.064201 |title=Decay Properties of <sup>266</sup>Bh and <sup>262</sup>Db Produced in the <sup>248</sup>Cm + <sup>23</sup>Na Reaction |year=2009 |author=Morita, Kosuke |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=78 |pages=064201 |coauthors=''et al.'' |issue=6|bibcode = 2009JPSJ...78f4201M }}</ref>

The first attempts to synthesize bohrium by hot fusion pathways were performed in 1979 by the team at Dubna, using the reaction between accelerated nuclei of [[neon]]-22 and targets of [[berkelium]]-249:

:{{Nuclide|Link|berkelium|249}} + {{Nuclide|Link|neon|22}} <U+2192> {{Nuclide|bohrium|271<U+2212>x}} + x {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|neutron}} (x = 4 or 5)

The reaction was repeated in 1983. In both cases, they were unable to detect any [[spontaneous fission]] from nuclei of bohrium. More recently, hot fusions pathways to bohrium have been re-investigated in order to allow for the synthesis of more long-lived, [[neutron]] rich isotopes to allow a first chemical study of bohrium. In 1999, the team at LBNL claimed the discovery of long-lived <sup>267</sup>Bh (5 atoms) and <sup>266</sup>Bh (1 atom).<ref name="266Bh">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.2697 |title=Evidence for New Isotopes of Element 107: <sup>266</sup>Bh and <sup>267</sup>Bh|year=2000|author=Wilk, P.

Bohrium has been detected in the decay chains of elements with a higher [[atomic number]], such as [[meitnerium]]. Meitnerium currently has seven known isotopes; all of them undergo alpha decays to become bohrium nuclei, with mass numbers between 262 and 274. Parent meitnerium nuclei can be themselves decay products of [[roentgenium]], [[ununtrium]], [[ununpentium]], or [[ununseptium]]. To date, no other elements have been known to decay to bohrium.<ref name=nuclidetable>{{cite web |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=107&n=163 |title=Interactive Chart of Nuclides |publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory |author=Sonzogni, Alejandro |location=National Nuclear Data Center |accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> For example, in January 2010, the Dubna team ([[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]) identified bohrium-274 as a product in the decay of ununseptium via an alpha decay sequence:<ref name="274Bh"/>

Bohrium has no stable or naturally-occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eleven different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260<U+2013>262, 264<U+2013>267, 270<U+2013>272, 274, one of which, bohrium-262, has a known [[metastable state]]. All of these decay only through alpha decay, although some unknown bohrium isotopes are predicted to undergo spontaneous fission.<ref name=nuclidetable/>

===Stability and half-lives===
The lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100&nbsp;ms for <sup>260</sup>Bh, <sup>261</sup>Bh, <sup>262</sup>Bh, <sup>262m</sup>Bh, and <sup>263</sup>Bh were observed. <sup>264</sup>Bh, <sup>265</sup>Bh, <sup>266</sup>Bh, and <sup>271</sup>Bh are more stable at around 1&nbsp;s, and <sup>267</sup>Bh and <sup>272</sup>Bh have half-lives of about 10&nbsp;s. The heaviest isotopes are the most stable, with <sup>270</sup>Bh and <sup>274</sup>Bh having measured half-lives of about 61&nbsp;s and 54&nbsp;s respectively. The unknown isotopes <sup>273</sup>Bh and <sup>275</sup>Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90&nbsp;minutes and 40&nbsp;minutes respectively. Before its discovery, <sup>274</sup>Bh was also predicted to have a long half-life of 90&nbsp;minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life of only about 54&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=nuclidetable/>

The proton-rich isotopes with masses 260, 261, and 262 were directly produced by cold fusion, those with mass 262 and 264 were reported in the decay chains of meitnerium and roentgenium, while the neutron-rich isotopes with masses 266, 267 were created in irradiations of actinide targets. The four most neutron-rich ones with masses 270, 271, 272, and 274 appear in the decay chains of <sup>282</sup>113, <sup>287</sup>115, <sup>288</sup>115, and <sup>294</sup>117 respectively. These eleven isotopes have half-lives ranging from 8&nbsp;miliseconds to 1&nbsp;minute.<ref name="Doi_" />

===Nuclear isomerism===
;<sup>262</sup>Bh
The only confirmed example of isomerism in bohrium is in the isotope <sup>262</sup>Bh. Direct synthesis of <sup>262</sup>Bh results in two states, a [[ground state]] and an [[nuclear isomer|isomeric state]]. The ground state is confirmed to decay by alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with energies of 10.08, 9.82, and 9.76&nbsp;MeV, and has revised half-life of 84&nbsp;ms. The excited state also decays by alpha decay, emitting alpha particles with energies of 10.37 and 10.24&nbsp;MeV, and has revised half-life of 9.6 ms.<ref name="262Bh"/>

==Chemical properties==
===Extrapolated===
Bohrium is projected to be the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group VII in the Periodic Table, below [[manganese]], [[technetium]] and [[rhenium]]. All the members of the group readily portray their group oxidation state of +7 and the state becomes more stable as the group is descended. Thus bohrium is expected to form a stable +7 state. Technetium also shows a stable +4 state whilst rhenium exhibits stable +4 and +3 states. Bohrium may therefore show these lower states as well.

The heavier members of the group are known to form volatile heptoxides M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, so bohrium should also form the volatile oxide Bh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. The oxide should dissolve in water to form perbohric acid, HBhO<sub>4</sub>.
Rhenium and technetium form a range of oxyhalides from the halogenation of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO<sub>3</sub>Cl, so BhO<sub>3</sub>Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO<sub>3</sub>F and MO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub> for the heavier elements in addition to the rhenium compounds ReOF<sub>5</sub> and ReF<sub>7</sub>. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties.

===Experimental===
In 1995, the first report on attempted isolation of the element was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Malmbeck|first1=R.|last2=Skarnemark|first2=G.|last3=Alstad|first3=J.|last4=Fure|first4=K.|last5=Johansson|first5=M.|last6=Omtvedt|first6=J. P.|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|volume=246|pages=349|year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1006791027906|issue=2}}</ref>

In 2000, it was confirmed that although relativistic effects are important, the 107th element does behave like a typical [[group 7 element]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=G<U+00E4>ggeler|first1=H. W.|last2=Eichler|first2=R.|last3=Br<U+00FC>chle|first3=W.|last4=Dressler|first4=R.|last5=D<U+00FC>llmann|first5=Ch.E.|last6=Eichler|first6=B.|last7=Gregorich|first7=K. E.|last8=Hoffman|first8=D.

In 2000, a team at the PSI conducted a chemistry reaction using atoms of <sup>267</sup>Bh produced in the reaction between Bk-249 and Ne-22 ions. The resulting atoms were thermalised and reacted with a HCl/O<sub>2</sub> mixture to form a volatile oxychloride. The reaction also produced isotopes of its lighter homologues, [[technetium]] (as <sup>108</sup>Tc) and [[rhenium]] (as <sup>169</sup>Re). The isothermal adsorption curves were measured and gave strong evidence for the formation of a volatile oxychloride with properties similar to that of rhenium oxychloride. This placed bohrium as a typical member of group 7.<ref name=00Ei01>[http://www.gsi.de/informationen/wti/library/scientificreport2000/Chemistry/9/r_eichler_jb2000.pdf "Gas chemical investigation of bohrium (Bh, element 107)"], Eichler et al., ''GSI Annual Report 2000''.
