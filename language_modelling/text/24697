'''Dnestr radar''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440>}}) and '''Dnepr radar''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0414><U+043D><U+0435><U+043F><U+0440>}}) ([[NATO reporting name|NATO]]: '''Hen House''') {{#tag:ref|NATO gave these the code name "Hen House" presumably because they looked like [[chicken coop]]s, according to Forden <ref name="cato"/>|group=note}} are the first generation of Soviet [[space surveillance]] and [[early warning radar]]. They are [[phased array]] radar systems designed to give early warning of attack from [[ballistic missile]]s. The network consisted of a number of radars on the periphery of the [[Soviet Union]] to cover attacks from different directions and were intended to be replaced by [[Daryal radar]]s. Only two of the planned Daryal radars became operational, due to issues such as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In common with other Soviet and Russian early warning radars they are named after rivers, the [[Dnestr]] and the [[Dnepr]].{{#tag:ref|Other examples are [[Voronezh radar]] named after the [[Voronezh River]], the [[Don-2N radar]] named after the [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]] and the [[Dunay radar]]s named after the Dunay ([[Danube]]).|group=note}} {{Asof|2012}}, the Russian early warning network still consists of some radars of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing radars will be replaced by the third generation [[Voronezh radar]]s by 2020.

==TsSO-P==
The Dnestr radar came from work on ballistic missile defence undertaken in the late 1950s and early 1960s. System A, the prototype for the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system]], was set up in the [[Sary Shagan]] testing grounds, in the [[Kazakh SSR]].{{r|Zaloga|page1=123}} Work on the system was led by design bureau [[KB-1]] which proposed using [[Very high frequency|VHF]] radar RTN ({{lang-rus|<U+0420><U+0422><U+041D>}}) and the [[Dunay radar|Dunay-2]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radar. Other alternatives were sought from Soviet industry and [[RTI]] proposed using VHF radar TsSO-P ({{lang-rus|<U+0426><U+0421><U+041E>-<U+041F>}}) and UHF radar  TsSS-30 ({{lang-rus|<U+0426><U+0421><U+0421>-30}}).<ref name="BKO"/>

TsSO-P (standing for {{lang-rus|<U+0446><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043E><U+0431><U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F> <U+2013> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0438><U+0433><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F>}} meaning ''central detection station <U+2013> test site'') was selected for further development, together with the Dunay-2.<ref name="BKO"/> TsSO-P had a long [[horn antenna]] {{convert|250|m}} long and {{convert|15|m}} high. <!-- scanning frequency in azimuth plane and phase method of measurement in the elevation plane - I don't understand this enough to translate it properly--> It had an array with an open ribbed structure and used 200 millisecond pulses. Hardware methods were designed for signal processing as the intended M-4 computer could not run the radar. It was built at area 8 in Sary Shagan and was located at {{coord|46|00|04.65|N|73|38|52.11|E|type:landmark}}. It first detected an object on 17 September 1961.<ref name="BKO"/>

TsSO-P took part in the 1961 and 1962 [[The K Project|Operation K]] tests at Sary Shagan to examine the effects of nuclear explosions on missile defence hardware.<ref name="BKO"/>

==Dnestr==
[[File:SarayShaganDnestr-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[KH-7|KH-7 Gambit]] US spy satellite image of a Dnestr space surveillance radar at [[Sary Shagan]], USSR, 28 May 1967. Note the radar arrays are in straight line.]]
TsSO-P was effective at satellite tracking and was chosen as the radar of the [[Istrebitel Sputnik]] (IS) anti-satellite programme. This programme involved involved the construction of two sites separated in latitude to form a radar field {{convert|5000|km}} long and {{convert|3000|km}} high. The two sites chosen were at the village of [[Mishelevka Radar Station|Mishelevka]] near [[Irkutsk]] in [[Siberia]], which was called OS-1, and at [[Balkhash Radar Station|Cape Gulshad]] on [[Lake Balkhash]] near [[Sary Shagan]], which was called OS-2. Each site received four Dnestr radar systems in a fan arrangement.<ref name="SoC-ABM" /><ref name="BKO"/><ref name="FAS-HenHouse" />{{r|PodvigBook|page1=421}}{{r|PodvigBook|page1=433}}<ref name="Vot11"/>

A Dnestr radar was composed of two TsSO-P radar wings joined together by a two story building containing a joint computer system and command post. Each radar wing covered a 30 degree sector with a 0.5 degree scanning beam. The elevation scanning pattern was a 'spade' with a width of 20 degrees. The radar systems were arranged to create a fan shaped barrier. Of the four radars, called cells ({{lang-rus|<U+0420><U+041B><U+042F>|RLYa}} roughly radio location cell), two faced to the west and two faced to the east. All scanned between +10 degrees and +90 degrees in elevation.<ref name="BKO"/>

Construction at the two sites started between 1962 and 1963 with improvements in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with [[semiconductor]]s, although the rest of the radar used [[Vacuum tube]]s. The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing.<ref name="BKO"/> In 1968 the [[Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik]] target satellite, [[DS-P1-Yu]], was used to test the ability of the system.<ref name="Vot11"/><ref name="gunter"/>

The Dnestr radars were accepted for service by the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] in April 1967 and became part of the [[space surveillance]] network [[SKKP]]. <ref name="BKO"/>{{r|PodvigBook|page1=434}}<ref name="Vot9"/>

==Dnestr-M==
Parallel with the implementation of the Dnestr space surveillance units, a modified version of the original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as an [[early warning radar]] to identify attacks by [[ballistic missile]]s. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia ([[Olenegorsk Radar Station|Olenegorsk]] <U+2013> RO-1) and near [[Riga]] in the then [[Latvian SSR]] ([[Skrunda-1|Skrunda]] <U+2013> RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet [[SPRN]] network, the equivalent of the NATO [[BMEWS]].{{r|PodvigBook|page1=421}}<ref name="BKO"/><ref name="Karpenko1999"/>

The first Dnestr-M at Olenegorsk was completed by 1968. <ref name="BKO"/> In 1970, the radars at Olenegorsk and Skrunda, and an associated command centre at [[Solnechnogorsk]], were accepted for service. According to Podvig (2002), it seems they were positioned to identify missile launches from NATO submarines in the [[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian]] and [[North Sea]]s. <ref name="Podvig-History"/>

The Dnestr-M included many improvements over the previous versions such as an increase in the [[pulse repetition frequency|pulse length]] from 200ms to 800ms which increased the range of objects identified, more semiconductors, and many other scanning and processing changes.<ref name="BKO"/>

A version of this radar was built at the [[Sary Shagan]] test site and was called TsSO-PM ({{lang-rus|<U+0426><U+0421><U+041E>-<U+041F><U+041C>}}). After this had completed tests in 1965 it was decided to upgrade nodes 1 and 2 of the two OS sites to Dnestr-M, keeping nodes 3 and 4 as Dnestr. These radars remained as space surveillance radars which scanned between +10 and +90 degrees, comparative to scanning between +10 and +30 degrees for the missile warning radars. A space surveillance network of four Dnestrs and four Dnestr-Ms, and two command posts was formally commissioned in 1971.<ref name="BKO"/>

[[File:Mukachevo dnepr openstreetmap.svg|thumb|right|Map of Dnepr radar site at Mukachevo. The two arrays are at 196 and 260 degrees (south and west)]]

==Dnepr==
Work to improve the radar continued. An improved array was designed which covered 60 degrees rather than 30. The first Dnepr radar was built at [[Balkhash Radar Station|Balkhash]] as a new radar, cell 5. It entered service on 12 May 1974.<ref name="Nov-B9"/> The second was a new early warning station at [[Sevastopol Radar Station|Sevastopol]]. New Dneprs were also built at [[Mishelevka Radar Station|Mishelevka]] and another at [[Skrunda-1|Skrunda]], and then one at [[Mukachevo Radar Station|Mukachevo]]. The remaining radars were all converted to Dnepr with the exception of cells 3 and 4 at Balkhash and Mishelevka which remained space surveillance radars. <ref name="BKO"/><ref name="Podvig-History"/>{{r|PodvigBook|page1=422}}

All current operational radars are described as Dnepr, and have been updated incrementally.<ref name="Nov-B9"/><ref name="redstar"/>

==Technical details==
Each Dnepr array is a double sectoral [[horn antenna]] 250m long by 12 m wide.<ref name="Nov-B9"/> It has two rows of [[Slot antenna|slot radiators]] within two [[waveguide]]s. At each end of the two arrays, there is a set of transmitting and receiving equipment. It emits a signal covering a sector 30 degrees in azimuth and 30 degrees in elevation, with the scanning controlled by frequency. Four sets mean the radar covers 120 degrees in azimuth and 30 degrees in elevation (5 to 35 degrees).<ref name="Nov-B9"/> <!-- the 120 degree thing may only be some of them, info from Balkhash. Some are supposed to do 180 degrees?-->

The Dnepr involved the horn antenna being reduced from 20 to 14 metres in height and the addition of a [[Polarization_(waves)|polarising filter]] <!-- note he says it was 15 m high earlier, now it is 20 reduced to 14? is one of these width? --><ref name="BKO"/>

==Current status==
{{GeoGroupTemplate|section=Current status}}
These radars have been installed at six different radar stations and as of 2012 are operational at three <U+2013> Balkhash, Mishelevka and Olenegorsk.<ref name="redstar"/><ref name="Lenta"/><ref name="Nov-B9"/> The 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] required that early warning radars were located on the periphery of national territory and faced outwards. This caused problems when the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991 as many of the radar stations were now in newly independent states. <ref name="nk-sprn"/><ref name="Podvig-History"/><ref name="Karpenko1999"/><ref name="nk-sprn-journal"/> The first station to close was Skrunda, in newly independent [[Latvia]]. A 1994 agreement between Russia and Latvia agreed that the two Dnepr radars there would stop working in 1998, and would be fully demolished by 2000.{{r|Chandra|page1=129}}{{r|Hadonina|page1=65}}{{r|PodvigBook|page1=426}}

Russia signed an agreement with Ukraine in 1992 allowing it to continue using the Dnepr radars at Sevastopol and Mukachevo. The stations were run by Ukrainian personnel and data was sent to the headquarters of the Russian early warning system in Solnechnogorsk.<ref name="CES"/><ref name=Rian-sprn/> In 2008 Russia announced that it was pulling out of the agreement with Ukraine and that the last data given to Russia from the stations would be in 2009.<ref name="RIAN2008"/>{{r|baev|page1=76}}<ref name="Podvig-Armavir2"/> The Ukrainian government announced that the stations were to be used part-time for space surveillance.<ref name="Kievpost2009"/><ref name="Kievpost2010"/>

The station in Balkhash in [[Kazakhstan]] remains the only Dnepr operational outside Russia. It has been modernised and is run by the [[Russian Aerospace Defence Forces]].<ref name="Nov-B9"/><ref name="EV-kommersant"/>

The remaining stations in Russia are due to be replaced by the [[Voronezh radar]]. The Dneprs in Mishelevka, Irkutsk will close once the second array of the new Voronezh radar is operational.<ref name="RIA-Nov3"/>. The Dnepr at Olenegorsk, Murmansk will be replaced by a Voronezh as well. It is planned to start construction there in 2017.<ref name="Lenta"/>
