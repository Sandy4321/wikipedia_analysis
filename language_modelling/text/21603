'''''City Reflections''''' is an outdoor 2009 [[bronze sculpture]] by [[Patti Warashina]], located in [[Downtown Portland|downtown]] [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Description and history==
''City Reflections'' was designed by American artist Patti Warashina,<ref name=RACC>{{cite web|title=Public Art Search: City Reflections|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=2881.108|publisher=[[Regional Arts & Culture Council]]|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> who was inspired by life on a public walkway in an urban environment. It was installed at the intersection of Southwest 6th Avenue and Southwest Main Street on the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in 2009.<ref name=RACC/><ref name=TriMet>{{cite web|title=Green Line Public Art Tour Audio Transcript: Portland Mall: City Reflections, Patti Warashina|url=http://trimet.org/publicart/greenline/transcript.htm#warashina|publisher=[[TriMet]]|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> It consists of two bronze sculptures depicting a standing figure and dog, respectively. According to [[TriMet]], which funded the work,<ref name=RACC/> the humanoid figure is a "stylized version of a strong female in both a classical and minimal form", while the dog serves as a "counterbalance" and is the "friendly canine companion that is so much a part of our popular culture".<ref name=TriMet/> The woman measures {{Convert|86|in|m}} x {{Convert|21|in|m}} x {{Convert|19|in|m}} and the dog measures {{Convert|33|in|m}} x {{Convert|13|in|m}} x {{Convert|27|in|m}}.<ref name=RACC/>

Both sculptures feature black and copper geometric shapes. The black shapes allude to aspects of the human body as well as the "shapes and shadows" of nearby buildings. The copper shapes represent "computer-generated forms, which speak to the times we live in". Dark shadows are depicted on the sidewalk, serving as "natural transitions" to pedestrians and signaling the time of day.<ref name=TriMet/> The woman's shadow measures {{Convert|58|in|m}} x {{Convert|26|in|m}} and the dog's shadow measures {{Convert|27|in|m}} x {{Convert|48|in|m}}.<ref name=RACC/>

''City Reflections'' is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts & Culture Council]] (RACC), which administers the work.<ref name=PAA>{{cite web|title=City Reflections|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/city-reflections|publisher=Public Art Archive|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name=CN>{{cite web|title=City Reflections, 2009|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&permalink=06579&seo=City-Reflections_Patti-Warashina-and-City-of-Portland-and-Multnomah-County-Public-Art-Collection-courtesy-of-the-Regional-Arts-Culture-Council|publisher=cultureNOW|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, RACC staff members deemed the sculpture too sensitive to corrosion due to its glossy finish to participate in the Downtown Marketing Initiative's "UglySweaterPDX" campaign, which outfits sculptures with "yard-bombed" articles of clothing, to promote shopping in downtown Portland.<ref name=OPB>{{cite web|title=Spinning Yarns: Knitwork On Statues Is Compliant Mischief|url=http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/spinning-yarns-knitwork-on-statues-is-compliant-mischief/|publisher=[[Oregon Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=November 27, 2014|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>
