Rockwell's idyllic and nostalgic approach to [[regionalism]] made him a popular [[illustrator]] but a lightly regarded fine artist during his lifetime.  These paintings generally are viewed with this sentiment.  However, he has created a niche in the enduring social fabric with the ''Freedom from Want'' image which is emblematic of what is now known as the "Norman Rockwell Thanksgiving."

Rockwell encouraged support of the war efforts during World War II via his covers which endorsed [[war bond]]s, encouraged women to work, and encouraged men to enlist in the service.

In 1941 the United States Government had three agencies responsible for war [[propaganda]]: The Office of Facts and Figures (OFF), The Division of Information of the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and Office of Government Reports (OGR).  The OFF was responsible for commissioned artwork and for assembling a corps of writers, led by [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]].  By mid 1942, the Office of War Information determined that despite the efforts of OFF in distributing pamphlets, posters, displays and other media, only a third of the general public was familiar with Roosevelt's four freedoms and at most one in fifty could enumerate them.<ref name=NRPftAP/>  The four freedoms had been a "campaign to educate Americans about participation in World War II."<ref name=ERIC>{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED202064&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED202064|title=FDR's 'Four Freedoms' Campaign: The Rhetorical Contribution of Norman Rockwell's Posters|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[United States Department of Education]]|work=Education Resource Information Center}}</ref>

Rockwell remembered a scene of a local town meeting in which one person spoke out in lone dissent, but was accorded the floor as a matter of [[protocol]].  A vision struck him to depict this scene to represent ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'', and then in 1942 Rockwell decided to use his [[Vermont]] neighbors as [[model (art)|model]]s for an inspirational set of posters depicting the themes laid out by Roosevelt the previous year in a Four Freedoms series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org/page96|title=Norman Rockwell in the 1940s: A View of the American Homefront |publisher=[[Norman Rockwell Museum]]|accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>  He spent three days making [[charcoal]] sketches of the series,<ref name=NRPftAP/> and the series took seven months to create.<ref name=ILTPP/>  [[Model (art)|Models]] included a Mrs. Harrington who became the devout old woman in Freedom of Worship and a man named Jim Martin who appears in each painting in the series.<ref name=ILTPP/>  The intention was to remind America what they were fighting for: freedom of speech and worship, freedom from want and fear.<ref name=AASfaWP/><ref name=NRPftAP/>  All of the paintings used a muted [[palette]] and are devoid of the use of [[vermilion]] that Rockwell is known for.<ref name=NRPftAP/>  

Rockwell's [[patriotic]] gesture was to travel to {{city-state|Washington|DC}} and volunteer his free services to the government for this cause.  As Rockwell bounced from one government office to the next he received no indication of interest by the government.  In fact, the Office of War Information told him that poster art like that used in [[World War I]] was not welcome because the government intended to use real artists instead this time.  Rockwell returned to the ''Saturday Evening Post'' and got an enthusiastic response from editor Ben Hibbs to publish his designs.<ref name=AASfaWP/><ref name=NRPftAP/>  Some sources published after Rockwell's question whether the government was truly as discouraging as Rockwell claimed.  They cite an [[April 23]][[1943]] correspondences with Thomas D. Mabry of the Office of War Information (a former Executive Director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]).<ref name=NRPftAP/>  At the time, the three government propaganda agencies were disjointed, and they were not unified under the Office of War Information (OWI) until [[June 13]][[1945]] by a [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential Executive Order]].<ref name=NRPftAP/>  There was also significant turmoil in the OWI as a faction had supported work by [[Ben Shahn]] as the writers division, led by MacLeish, was blamed for failing to deliver a message intelligible to people of varying intelligence.  Shahn's work would not be used extensively for propaganda because it lacked general appeal.<ref name=NRPftAP/>

Upon publication ''The Saturday Evening Post'' received millions of [[reprint]] requests.<ref name=NRI/> Rockwell's version of the story is that only after the public got caught up in the idea did the Office of War Information get involved by producing 2.5 million sets of Four Freedoms posters.<ref name=AASfaWP>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5D91E3CF937A25753C1A9679C8B63|title= ART/ARCHITECTURE; Salve for a Wounded People|accessdate=2008-04-07|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[2001-10-14]]|author=Marling, Karal Ann}}</ref><ref name=ILTPP/>  By the end of the war 4 million posters had been printed.<ref name=NRPftAP/> and in all, 25 million people bought Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' prints.<ref name=NRR>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90208|title=Norman Rockwell Revisited|accessdate=2008-04-07|date=[[1999-11-15]]|publisher=Newsweek, Inc.|work=[[Newsweek magazine]]|author=Plagens, Peter}}</ref>  Both the freedom from fear and freedom from want posters had the leading caption "Ours.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.to fight for" and the freedom of speech and freedom of worship had the leading caption "Buy War Bonds" and the word "Save" before the respective freedom.{{fact|date=April 2008}}

Between 1941 and 1946, the United States Department of the Treasury conducted eight War Loan Drives to promote the sale of war Bonds to finance America's World War II efforts.  In 1943, the ''Saturday Evening Post'' donated the ''Four Freedoms'' to the Second War Loan Drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosietheriveter.org/painting.htm|title=Rockwell's Rosie the Riveter Painting Auctioned|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> Rockwell's Four Freedoms [[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]], [[Freedom of Worship (painting)|Freedom to Worship]], [[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]] and [[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]] were first published in [[February 20]], [[February 27]], [[March 6]] and [[March 13]] [[1943]] along with commissioned essays from leading American writers and historians.

==Critical review==
Rockwell is considered the "quintessential middlebrow American artist."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDE1139F931A25754C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4|title=The Candidates as Culture Vultures|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=[[1992-07-12]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Kelly, Michael}}</ref> As an artist he is an [[illustrator]] rather than a [[fine arts]] painter.  Although his style is [[painterly]], his work is produced for the purpose of mass reproduction, and it is produced with the intent of delivering a common message to its viewers via a detailed narrative style.<ref name=NRR/><ref name=AAaA/>  Furthermore, the vast majority of Rockwell's work was viewed in reproduced format and almost none of his contemporaneous audience ever saw his original work.<ref name=AV/><ref name=AAaA/>  Also, Rockwell style of backwoods [[New England]] small-town [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], known as [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], was sometimes viewed as out of step with the oncoming wave of [[abstract art|abstract]] [[modern art]].<ref name=NRR/><ref>{{cite book|title=Art in the Modern Era|author=Dempsey, Amy|isbn=0-8109-4172-4|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|chapter=1918-1945: American Scene|pages=165|date=2002}}</ref> Some say his realism is so direct that he abstains from using artistic license.  In short, because he did nothing interesting, thought-provoking, rare or cutting-edge he was no [[Rembrandt]].<ref name=NRR/>  Some also view his sentimental and nostalgic vision out of step with the harsh realities of American life, such as [[The Great Depression]].<ref name=AAaA>{{cite book|title=Americn Art and Artists|chapter=The Depression and World War II|pages=122-123|publisher=[[HarperCollins Publishers]]|date=2007|author=Wright, Tricia|isbn=978-0-06-089124-4}}</ref>  Some have summarized this combination by saying that Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' lack artistic maturity.  Others point to the universality of the ''Freedom of Religion'' as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths.<ref name=ILTPP>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=2008-04-07|date=[[1943-06-21]]|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]}}</ref>  However, some criticism would be almost the opposite with complaints that he [[idealism|idealized]] American life. By depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of the bad and the ugly parts of American life.<ref name=AAaA/> Rockwell's response to this criticism was: {{cquote|I paint life as I would like it to be. - Rockwell<ref name=AAaA/>}}

Although all four images were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, ''Freedom from Want'', which depicts an elderly couple serving a fat turkey to what looks like a table of happy and eager children and grandchildren has given the idyllic Norman Rockwell [[Thanksgiving]] work as important a place in the enduring marketplace of promoting family togetherness, peace and plenty as [[Hallmark]] at Christmas.<ref name=ANRT/>  

The commercial success of the series is in part due to the fact that each painting is considered so understandable that they were viewed by their generation as the model of understandable art by the general public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779887,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=Docents' Duties|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=[[1948-06-28]]|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]}}</ref> The success of Rockwell's depictions was due to his use of long-standing American cultural values about [[unity]] and respect of certain institutions while using symbols that enabled a broad audience to identify with his images.<ref name=ERIC/> This understandability made it one extreme on the scale of artistic complexity when comparing the series to contemporaneous art.  It was diametrically opposed to the [[abstract art]] and far removed from the intrigue of [[surrealism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775761,00.html|title=The U.S. & the United Nations|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=[[1945-06-04]]|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]}}</ref>

Although there has been a long history of Rockwell detractors, during the ''Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People'' attendance was record-setting and critical reviews were quite favorable.  The nostalgia seemed to cause a bit of revisionism in the artworld.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFDC1131F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63&scp=8&sq=%22Four+Freedoms%22+Rockwell&st=nyt|title= MIRROR, MIRROR; Rockwell, Irony-Free|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=[[2001-10-28]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Green, Penelope}}</ref>
