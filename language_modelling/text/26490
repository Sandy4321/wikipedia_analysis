==Strength==
{{See also|Magnetic field strength}}
The magnetic field is about 1.1% as strong as [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's]].<ref name="Mercury Magnetic Field"/> At the Hermean equator, the relative strength of the magnetic field is around 300 [[Tesla (unit)|nT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinlab.ess.ucla.edu/PAPERS/Kabin-etal-Icarus08.pdf|title=Global MHD modeling of Mercury<U+2032>s magnetosphere with applications to the MESSENGER mission and dynamo theory |format=PDF |first=K. |last=Kabin |first2=M.

Because Mercury's magnetic field is weak while the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] it interacts with in its orbit (a [[perihelion]] at 0.307 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] and an [[aphelion]] at 0.467 AU) is relatively strong, the solar wind dynamic pressure at Mercury<U+2032>s orbit on the average is also a factor of three larger than that at Earth, for example. Mercury's magnetic field being weaker than Earth's may be because its core had cooled and solidified more quickly than the Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/graduate/PhDtopics-2011/Vocadlo%20&%20Stixrude%20-%20Mercury.pdf|title=Mercury: its composition, internal structure and magnetic field|work=UCL Earth Sciences|author=Lidunka Vo<U+010D>adlo; Lars Stixrude|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> Scientists have detected Mercury's magnetic field to be weaker than [[Jupiter]]'s [[Natural satellite|moon]] [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede's]].

Since its discovery in 1974 by ''Mariner 10'', Mercury's [[magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moment]] has decayed. Dr. Robert Humphreys had predicted that in 2011, the magnetic moment should be between 4.5 and 4.6 x 10<sup>19</sup> joules per tesla (ampere-square meters);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/magnetic-message-from-mercury|title=Magnetic Message from Mercury|work=Creation Ministries International|author=Russell Humphreys|date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> but instead, when measured, the magnetic moment had declined from 4.8 to just over 3.8 x 10<sup>19</sup> joules per tesla. Such a rapid decline would account for nearly 30 percent of the magnetic moment. Data from ''Mariner 10'' and the [[MESSENGER|MESSENGER spacecraft]] illustrate that the strength and shape of the magnetic field seems stable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/14009/orbit-of-mercury/|title=Orbit of Mercury|work=Universe Today|author=Jerry Coffey|date=2008-05-01|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref>

==Origins==
{{See also|Dynamo theory}}
The origins of the magnetic field can be explained by [[dynamo theory]];<ref name="Molten Core Mystery"/> i.e., by the convection of electrically conductive molten iron in the planet's outer [[Planetary core|core]].<ref name="Magnetic Field Measurement">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Measuring_the_Magnetic_Field_of_Mercury_999.html|title=Measuring the Magnetic Field of Mercury|work=SpaceDaily|author=Staff Writers|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2011-07-16}}</ref> A dynamo is generated by a large iron core that has sank to a planet's [[center of mass]], has not cooled over the years, an outer core that has not been completely solidified, and circulates around the interior. Before its discovery in 1974, it was thought that Mercury<U+2032>s core had cooled over the years of evolution of the [[Solar System]], regarding the planet's small size. There are still difficulties with this dynamo theory, including the fact that Mercury has a slow, 59-day-long orbit that could not have made it possible to generate a [[magnetic field]].

This dynamo is probably weaker than Earth's because it is driven by thermo-compositional convection associated with inner core solidification. The thermal gradient at the core<U+2013>mantle boundary is subadiabatic, and hence the outer region of the liquid core is stably stratified with the dynamo operating only at depth, where a strong field is generated.<ref>{{Cite journal|publisher=Max-Planck Institute|location=Katlenberg-Lindau|title=Nature; 2006|volume=v. 444|issue=7122|pages= 1056<U+2013>1058|doi=10.1038/nature05342|year=2006 Max-Planck Institute of Germany|contribution=A deep dynamo generating Mercury's magnetic field|first=Ulrich R.|last=Christensen|journal=Max-Planck Institute, Germany, Nature |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/abs/nature05342.html|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->|bibcode = 2006Natur.444.1056C }}</ref> Because of the planet's slow rotation, the resulting magnetic field is dominated by small-scale components that fluctuate quickly with time.

==Magnetic poles and magnetic measurement==
[[File:Mercury in color - Prockter07 centered.jpg|thumb|Mercury's magnetic field tends to be stronger at the equator than at other areas of Mercury.]]
Like Earth's, Mercury's magnetic field is tilted,<ref name="Mercury Magnetic Poles"/><ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.windows2universe.org/mercury/mercury_polar_regions.html |title = Mercury's Poles |work = Windows to the Universe |author = Randy Russell |date = 2009-05-29 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> meaning that the magnetic poles are not located in the same area as the geographic poles. As a result of the north-south asymmetry in Mercury's internal magnetic field, the geometry of magnetic field lines is different in Mercury's north and south polar regions.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/multimedia/messenger_news20110616_image3.html|title = Magnetic field lines differ at Mercury's north and south poles|author = Lynn Jenner; Brian Dunbar|publisher = [[NASA]]|date = 2011-06-16|accessdate = 2011-07-18}}</ref> In particular, the magnetic "polar cap" where field lines are open to the interplanetary medium is much larger near the south pole. This geometry implies that the south polar region is much more exposed than in the north to charged particles heated and accelerated by solar wind<U+2013>magnetosphere interactions. The strength of the [[Magnetic moment|quadrupole moment]] and the tilt of the dipole moment are completely unconstrained.<ref name="Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere">{{Cite web |url = http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/merc_mag/ |title = Mercury: Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere |author = C.

There have been various ways that Mercury's magnetic field has been measured. In general, the inferred equivalent internal dipole field is smaller when estimated on the basis of magnetospheric size and shape (~150<U+2013>200 nT ''R''<sup>3</sup>).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.5685&rep.pdf |title=Modelling of magnetic field measurements at Mercury |publisher=Imperial College, London |author=Giacomo Giampieri; Andr<U+00E9> Balogh |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> Recent Earth-based radar measurements of Mercury's rotation revealed a slight rocking motion explaining that Mercury's core is at least partially molten, implying that iron "snow" helps maintain the magnetic field.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080507110712.htm |title= Iron 'snow' helps maintain Mercury's magnetic field, scientists say |work= ScienceDaily |date= 2008-05-08 |accessdate= 2011-07-18}}</ref> The MESSENGER spacecraft will collect more than 500 million measurements of the planet's magnetic field, using its sensitive 'Magnetometer'.<ref name="Magnetic Field Measurement"/>

==Discovery==
[[File:Mariner 10.jpg|thumb|Data from ''Mariner 10'' led to the discovery of Mercury's magnetic field.]]
Before 1974, it was thought that Mercury could not generate a magnetic field because of its relatively small diameter and lack of an [[atmosphere]]. However, when ''Mariner 10'' made a fly-by of Mercury (somewhere around April 1974), it detected a magnetic field that was about 1/100th the total magnitude of [[Earth's magnetic field]]. But these passes provided weak constraints on the magnitude of the intrinsic magnetic field, its orientation and its harmonic structure, in part because the coverage of the planetary field was poor and because of the lack of concurrent observations of the solar wind number density and velocity.<ref name="Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere"/> Since the discovery, Mercury's magnetic field has received a great deal of attention,<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> primarily because of Mercury's small size and slow 59-day-long orbit.

Regarding the origins of the magnetic field, it is currently thought that it comes from the [[Dynamo theory|dynamo mechanism]],<ref name="Molten Core Mystery"/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,879479,00.html|title = Science: Mercury's Magnetism|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = 1975-03-31|accessdate = 2011-07-23}}</ref> although whether this is responsible for the magnetic field or not has not been clarified well.

==Field characteristics==
[[File:MESSENGER.jpg|thumb|The MESSENGER spacraft noted that Mercury's magnetic field is responsible for several magnetic "tornadoes" <U+2013> twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary field to [[interplanetary space]] <U+2013> that are some 800 km wide or a third the total radius of the planet.]]

When ''Mariner 10'' made a fly-by of Mercury back in 1974, its signals measured the bow shock, the entrance and exit from the magnetopause, and that the magnetospheric cavity is ~20 times smaller than Earth's, all of which had presumably decayed during the MESSENGER flyby.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~shane/PTYS_395_MERCURY/presentations/Mercury_magnetic_field.pdf|title = Mercury's Magnetic Field|publisher = [[University of Arizona]] <U+2013> [[Lunar and Planetary Laboratory]]|format = PDF|author = Kerri Donaldson Hanna|accessdate = 2011-07-25}}</ref> Even though the field is just over 1% as strong as Earth's, its detection by ''Mariner 10'' was taken by some scientists as an indication that Mercury's outer core was still [[Planetary core|liquid]], or at least partially liquid with [[iron]] and possibly other [[metal]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11782-molten-core-may-explain-mercurys-magnetic-field.html|title=Molten core may explain Mercury's magnetic field|work=New Scientist|author=David Shiga|date=2007-05-03|accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref>
