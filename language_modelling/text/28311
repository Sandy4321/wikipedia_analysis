"'''Lacrymosa'''" is a song recorded by American rock band [[Evanescence]] for their second studio album, ''[[The Open Door]]'' (2006). The song was composed by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo and produced by Dave Fortman. "Lacrymosa" incorporates the ''[[Lacrimosa (Requiem)|Lacrimosa]]'' sequence from [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart's ''Requiem'']] (1791) throughout the song and Lee said that its main inspiration is the film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]''. The song is influenced by genres such as alternative metal, gothic rock, and post-grunge. Set in slow tempo, it was originally written in the key of [[D minor]] but Lee and Balsamo transposed it into [[E minor]].

The song was praised as one of the best songs on ''The Open Door'' by critics, who particularly complimented the backing choir. According to Lee, "Lacrymosa" was originally written for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', but was not included because of its dark sound. The producers of ''Narnia'', however, rebutted her claim, stating this information was "news to them" and that no Evanescence music had been planned for inclusion in the soundtrack. The song was part of the setlist during their [[The Open Door Tour]]. The title of the track, lacrymosa, means "related to sadness."

== Background and recording ==
"Lacrymosa" was written by [[Amy Lee]] and [[Terry Balsamo]] and produced by [[Dave Fortman]].<ref name="Cre" /> [[David Campbell (composer)|David Campbell]], who has previously arranged music for the band and worked with them at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], led a 22-piece orchestra for the song. The Millennium Choir performed the ''Lacrimosa'' sequence ("Lacrimosa dies illa Qua resurget ex favilla Judicandus homo reus. Huic ergo parce, Deus: Pie Jesu Domine, Dona eis requiem. Amen.") and backing vocals throughout the song.<ref name="Cre" /> It was recorded in a chapel near [[Seattle]], Washington.<ref name="Cre" /><ref name="majesticw" /> In a number of interviews, Lee revealed that everyone asked about a collaboration between her and Mozart.<ref name="majesticw" /> She further stated that she always wanted to make ''Lacrimosa'' from Mozart's ''Requiem'' a metal song, later adding that ''The Open Door'' was "the time for that, for trying things I hadn't been brave enough to try before."<ref name="smh" /> In an interview with VH1 News, Lee further explained the inspiration behind the song 
<blockquote> 
"I saw ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' when I was nine years old and fell in love with Mozart. The part of Mozart's ''Requiem'' called "Lacyrmosa" [''sic''] is my favorite piece of music ever. I always wished we could cover it, but with programming and guitars and make it cool. It's our moment to try all the things I wanted to and couldn't, so I started messing with it in [[Pro Tools|Protools]]. Terry wrote some [[riff]]s and turned it into this awesome metal epic."<ref name="vh1news" /></blockquote>

==Composition, music and lyrics==
[[File:David Campbell Conducting.jpg|thumb|left|175px|David Campbell led an orchestra for "Lacrymosa"]]
According to the sheet music published by [[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing]] on musicnotes.com, "Lacrymosa" is an [[alternative metal]], [[gothic rock]] and [[post-grunge]] song set in a [[Time signature|common time]] and performed in slow [[tempo]] of 48 beats per minute.<ref name="mn5951" /> Although the original ''Lacrimosa'' sequence was performed in D-minor, it was transposed into E-minor by Lee and Terry Balsamo.<ref name="mn5951" /> The instruments in the song are [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[violin]]s and [[drum kit|drums]]. Lee's vocal range from the note of [[B (musical note)|B<sub>3</sub>]] and [[E (musical note)|E<sub>5</sub>]]; the [[SATB]] choir ranges from the note of B<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>4</sub>.<ref name="mn5951" /> "Lacrymosa" has a "violin intro, synth worth of a [[Nine Inch Nails]] album, and Omen-esque choral sections that are very haunting."<ref name="gauntlet" />

[[File:Croce-Mozart-Detail.jpg|thumb|130px|The band sampled the ''Lacrimosa'' sequence from Mozart's ''Requiem'' throughout the song.]]

According to Rob Sheffield from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', in "Lacrymosa" Lee is "sobbing hysterically over a grand piano."<ref name="roll" /> According to the [[IGN]] reviewer, Ed Thompson, the song "takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee's celestial voice, and adds her brooding lyrics 'I can't change who I am, not this time, I won't lie to keep you near me and in this short life, there's no time to waste on giving up. My love wasn't enough'.".<ref name="IGN" /> Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index stated that "Lee's astounding classical vocals are displayed with songs as the eerie 'Like You,' and 'Lacrymosa'."<ref name="Baudhuin" /> She said that these two songs feature slower beats, and are more "piano-themed melodies, followed shortly by the power guitar section of the song." But she said that the song was very similar to "Haunted" from ''Fallen'' adding, "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting."<ref name="Baudhuin" /> Jim Farber from [[Daily News (New York)|nydailynews.com]] said that "Lacrymosa" will remind older listeners the '70s art-rock horror [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]].<ref name="nydailynews.com" /> Andree Farias from ''[[Christianity Today]]'' said "[But] the song has nothing to do with [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] and her escapades into the land of [[Aslan]]. Rather, it's just another bitter break-up anthem: 'And you can blame it on me / Just set your guilt free, honey / I don't want to hold you back now love.'"<ref name="christianity" />

== Critical reception ==
{{quote box|width=30%|quote="Add in electronic backing beats, symphonic string section and heavy guitar and the elements are there. But this time, Evanescence went one step further - they added an ethereal choir backing track, giving the track a contrasting representation of light and dark and making the song just that much more haunting."| source=-[[IGN]]'s Ed Thompson talking about "Lacrymosa."<ref name="IGN" />}}

"Lacrymosa" received positive to mixed reviews from music critics. Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] put the song in the list of Top Tracks on ''The Open Door'' alongside with "[[Sweet Sacrifice]]", "[[Call Me When You're Sober]]", "Your Star" and "[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]". He added "Elements such as the connection of the song 'Lacrymosa' to the Mozart 'Requiem' movement of the same name, or intense exploration of the benefits and costs of '[[Lithium (Evanescence song)|Lithium]]' give hints that Evanescence could add intellectual heft to their obvious command of emotion."<ref name="About.com" /> Ed Thompson from [[IGN]] called "Lacrymosa" the "most memorable track" in the whole album.<ref name="IGN" /> Don Kaye of the website [[Blabbermouth.net]] said that while the song was an "interesting experiment"<ref name="blab" /> it came "across as more of a stab at artsiness with its strings and choirs than a real song."<ref name="blab" />

An editor from ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that "Lacrymosa" is grandiose even by the album<U+2019>s standards.<ref name="newyork" /> [[Sputnikmusic]] said that the song is the best on the album and gave the song a grade of 4.5 along with "Good Enough", adding that on the last two songs the album stops to be boring because of the variations.<ref name="sputnik" /> Simon Cosyns from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' concluded that "song titles such as 'Weight of the World', 'Lose Control' and 'Lacrymosa' tell you it<U+2019>s not a bed of roses, but there is a positive streak running through ''The Open Door''".<ref name="the sun" /> On [[Postmedia News]] it was stated that Lee "achieves stunning notes on 'Lacrymosa', which employs a haunting choir".<ref name="canada" /> Jordan Reimer from ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' praised Lee's melodies and said that "Cloud Nine" and "Lacrymosa" were her best two arrangements.<ref name="DailyPrincetonian" /> John Hood from ''[[Miami New Times]]'' made a story, "'Call Me When You're Sober' sent a man away, 'Lacrymosa' kept him there, and 'Cloud Nine' told the clueless dolt why he would no longer ever be welcomed back.<ref name="miami" /> Joost Melis from the Dutch website [[FOK!]] compared "Lacrymosa" with song of the bands [[Within Temptation]] and [[Nightwish]].<ref name="dutch" /> A writer of ''[[The Independent]]'' put the song on his list of "Download This" from ''The Open Door''.<ref name="ie.co.uk" />

Brendan Butler from [[Cinema Blend]] was critical saying that "the worst song on ''The Open Door'', i[t<U+2019>]s a toss up between 'Lacrymosa' with its abominable choir and the obnoxious 'Lose Control,' which features Amy crying for about five minutes."<ref name="cinema" /> A reviewer from Altsounds noted that the weakest tracks on the album are "Snow White Queen", "Lacrymosa", "Like You", and "Lose Control" because "the vocal arraignments on those tracks just do not flow with the lyrics and music combined therefore making them annoying because [Lee's] voice gets a bit unsettling and can only be tolerable to a certain extent."<ref name="alt" /> Glenn Gamboa from ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' concluded that "maybe the over-the-top dramatics of 'Lacrymosa' and piano ballad 'Your Star' will be seen as so-bad-they<U+2019>re-good."<ref name="projo" /> 

== Live performances ==
The song was played live by the band during their tour for the promotion of ''The Open Door''. On the concert which took place on November 17, 2007 in [[Orem, Utah|Orem]] the band played "Lacrymosa". During the performance Lee was wearing a purple tank, black skirt and black boots.<ref name="deseret" /> They also performed the song at [[Hammerstein Ballroom]] in New York in 2006.<ref name="mtv" /> Evanescence played the song live at their secret [[New York]] gig which took place on November 4, 2009.<ref name="rstone091105"/><ref name="bmouth091105" />

==Controversy and usage in media==
In a 2004 interview with [[MTV News]], Amy Lee revealed that she was composing music for the film, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''.<ref name="mtv1493917" /> She also revealed that the producers of the movie offered her a small role, "They were like, 'Do you want to do a cameo?' And I was like, 'Hell yeah! Let me die. I want to be somebody who gets murdered.' So I don't think that's going to happen."<ref name="mtv1493917" /> She later revealed that "Lacrymosa" was originally written for the film, but was mysteriously not included.<ref name="metaledge" /> However, according to producers, neither Lee or the band were approached to compose music for the film.<ref name="nzh569" /> Another song was also written for the movie, but it was rejected because of its dark sound.<ref name="metaledge" /> Lee went on to state that it was just "more great stuff [for The Open Door]".<ref name="Evboardbunchostuff" />

The word lacrymosa means "related to sadness".<ref name="vh1news" /> The track title is also the scientific name for a species of moth known as ''[[Catocala lacrymosa]]'', also known as the 'Tearful Underwing'.<ref name="silkmoths" /> The species of moth are featured throughout ''The Open Door''{{'}}s cover booklet and on the cover of the "[[Sweet Sacrifice]]" radio promo CD.<ref name="sweetsacrifice" /> A clip of "Lacrymosa" was used in the video teaser for ''The Open Door''.<ref name="teaser1" /><ref name="teaser2" />
