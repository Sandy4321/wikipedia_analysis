{{History of Albania}}
'''Albanian Kingdom''' ([[Albanian language|Gheg Albanian]]: ''Mbretnija Shqiptare'', Standard Albanian: ''Mbret<U+00EB>ria Shqiptare'', {{lang-it|Regno albanese}}) existed as a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], officially led by Italy's King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and its government led by Italian governors between 1939 after being [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied by Italy]] until 1943. During this time, [[Albania]] ceased to exist as an independent country, and existed as an autonomous part of the [[Italian Empire]] led by Italian government officials who intended to make Albania part of a [[Greater Italy]].

After the Italian invasion, Albania formally remained formally a separate country, but in a "close union" with Italy. In actual fact however the country was little more than an Italian protectorate subordinated to Italian interests, along the lines of the German [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]: the Albanian crown was declared in [[personal union]] with the Italian crown, Albania was to be governed by an Italian [[vicegerent]] representing King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], a customs union was enacted, and Albanian foreign policy was to be handled by Rome. The Albanian armed forces were subsumed in the Italian military, Italian advisors were placed inside all levels of the Albanian administration, and the country fascisticized with the establishment of an [[Albanian Fascist Party]] and its attendant organizations, modelled after the Italian prototype. Italian citizens began to settle in Albania as [[Italian colonists in Albania|colonists]] and to own land so that they could gradually transform it into Italian soil.<ref>{{citation | first1=Raphael | last1=Lemkin | first2=Samantha | last2=Power | year= 2008 | title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe | publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd. | isbn = 978-1584779018 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y0in2wOY-W0C | pages=99<U+2013>107}}</ref> 

While Victor Emmanuel ruled as king, [[Shefqet V<U+00EB>rlaci]] served as the [[Prime Minister]]. V<U+00EB>rlaci controlled the day-to-day activities of the Italian protectorate.

Albania was important culturally and historically to the nationalist aims of the Italian Fascists, as the territory of Albania had long been part of the [[Roman Empire]], even prior to the annexation of northern Italy by the Romans. Later, during the [[High Middle Ages]] some coastal areas (like [[Durazzo]]) had been influenced and owned by Italian powers, chiefly the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] for many years (cf. [[Albania Veneta]]). The Italian Fascist regime legitimized its claim to Albania through studies proclaiming the racial affinity of Albanians and Italians, especially as opposed ot the Slavic Yugoslavs.<ref>{{citation | first=Aristotle A. | last=Kallis | title=Fascist ideology: territory and expansionism in Italy and Germany, 1922<U+2013>1945 | publisher=Routledge | year= 2000 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=BeeRQHDOKXQC | pages= 132<U+2013>133}}</ref> Albanians were supposedly linked through ethnic heritage to the [[Italians]] due to links with the prehistoric [[Italiotes]], [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] populations, and that the major influence exhibited by the Roman and Venetian empires over Albania justified Italy's right to possess it.<ref name=Ro106>{{cite book|last=Rodogno. |first=Davide |title=Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fascism%27s+European+empire:+Italian+occupation+during+the+Second+World+War&hl=en&ei=dig_TPn6OYKC8gaGlcDpCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521845157|page=106}}</ref>

Italy also attempted to legitimize and win public support for its rule over Albania by supporting Albanian irredentism, directed against the predominantly Albanian-populated [[Kosovo]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and [[Epirus (periphery)|Epirus]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], particularly the border area of [[Chameria]], inhabited by the [[Cham Albanians|Cham Albanian]] minority.<ref>{{Citation | last=Fischer | first=Bernd J<U+00FC>rgen | title=Albania at War, 1939-1945 | publisher= C.

=== Albania at war ===
Strategically, control of Albania gave Italy an important beachhead in the Balkans: not only did it complete Italian control of the [[Strait of Otranto]] and the entrance to the [[Adriatic Sea]], it could be used to invade either Yugoslavia (in tandem with another thrust via [[Veneto]]) or Greece.<ref name="Kallis132"/>

In October 1940, during the [[Greco-Italian War]], Albania served as a staging-area for Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s unsuccessful invasion of [[Greece]].  Mussolini planned to invade Greece and other countries like [[Yugoslavia]] in the area to give Italy territorial control of most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coastline, as part of the Fascists' objective of creating the objective of ''[[Italian Mare Nostrum|Mare Nostrum]]'' ("Our Sea") in which Italy would dominate the Mediterranean. But the Albanian army under the command of colonel Pervizi<ref>Pieter Hidri, The General Prenk Pervizi, Tirana, Toena, 2002.</ref> abandoned the Italians in combat, causing a major unraveling of their lines. The Albanian army believed to be the cause of the betrayal was removed from the front. The Colonel Pervizi and his staff of officials was isolated in the mountains of Puka and Shkodra to the North<ref>''Julian Amery, The sons of the Eagle, London, 1946, s. 302-306''</ref>. This was the first action of revolt against the Italian occupation.

But, soon after the Italian invasion, the Greeks counter-attacked and a sizable portion of Albania was in Greek hands (including the cities of [[Gjirokast<U+00EB>r]] and [[Kor<U+00E7><U+00EB>]]). In April 1941, Greece capitulated after an overwhelming [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]]. All of Albania returned to Italian control, which was also extended to most of Greece, which was [[Axis Occupation of Greece|jointly occupied]] by Italy, Germany and Bulgaria. Italian plans however to annex Chameria to Albania were shelved due strong opposition and ethnic conflict between Albanians and Greeks, as well as opposition by [[Aromanians]] to the region being Albanianized.<ref name=Ro108>{{cite book|last=Rodogno. |first=Davide |title=Fascism's European empire: Italian occupation during the Second World War|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcUNELPsQQsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fascism%27s+European+empire:+Italian+occupation+during+the+Second+World+War&hl=en&ei=dig_TPn6OYKC8gaGlcDpCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521845157|page=108}}</ref>

After the fall of Yugoslavia and Greece in April 1941, the Italian Fascists added to the territory of the Kingdom of Albania most of the Albanian-inhabited areas that had been previously given to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The Albanian fascists claimed in May 1941 that nearly all the Albanian populated territories were united to Albania ([http://terkepek.adatbank.transindex.ro/kepek/netre/226.gif see map]).  But this was even a consequence of borders that Italy and Germany agreed on when dividing their spheres of influence. Some small portions of territories with Albanian majority remained outside the new borders and contact between the two parts was practically impossible: the Albanian population under the Bulgarian rule was heavily oppressed.

After the [[Armistice with Italy|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943, the country was [[Albania under Germany|occupied by the Germans]] until the end of the war.
