==Recording and production==
Preparation for ''All Hope Is Gone'' reportedly began in 2007, drummer [[Joey Jordison]] explains; "I've told them to demo whatever they can so we've got as much material to chose from as possible."<ref>{{cite news| title=Slipknot man promises brutal new album in '08| url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2007/07/slipknot_man_promises_brutal_n.html|date=2007-07-20| accessdate=2007-11-29|publisher = Emap}}</ref> In February 2008,<ref>{{cite web |author = [[Mick Thomson|Thomson, Mick]] |title = NAMM 2008 Report |publisher = On Track Magazine |url= http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=29777240|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> Slipknot entered the [[Sound Farm Studio & Recording Environment|Sound Farm Studio]] in [[Jamaica, Iowa|Jamaica]], [[Iowa]] with producer [[Dave Fortman]].<ref name="RevAugust">{{cite journal |last = Epstein |first = Dan |year = 2008 |month = August |title = Wait and Bleed |journal = [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] |pages = 54-6 |accessdate = 2008-06-14}}</ref> Unlike any of their previous albums, ''All Hope Is Gone'' was written and recorded in the band's home state of Iowa. Bassist [[Paul Gray]] explained that they decided to do this because in [[Los Angeles]] <U+2014> where all their previous albums were produced <U+2014> there are too many distractions.<ref>{{cite web |title = Slipknot brings Mayhem |work = AZCentral.com |publisher = ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' |date = 2008-07-16 |url = http://www.webcitation.org/5ZY09Zt6s |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> Band members also revealed that it was good for their mindset being so close to home, in an interview with ''[[Kerrang!]]'', vocalist [[Corey Taylor]] revealed that he would make a point of driving home every night to see his son.<ref name="K!JulySpecial">{{cite news |title = We are Slipknot and somebody's gonna get killed... |work = [[Kerrang!]] |pages = 22-27 |publisher = [[Emap]] |date = 2008-07-26}}</ref> Of the album's production Jordison said, "it's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." Complimenting Fortman's ear for tone, he explains that he believes that this is the band's best album sonically.<ref>{{cite web |title = Metal Hammer Podcast Is Live |publisher = [[Metal Hammer]] |date = 2008-07-24 |url = http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=48715 |format = [[Podcast]] |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> The album was mixed by [[Colin Richardson]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |last = Wilcox |first = Daniel |title = The Great Rock News Report |publisher = 411mania |date = 2008-07-16 |url = http://www.411mania.com/music/columns/80407/The-Great-Rock-News-Report-07.16.08.htm |accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref>

[[Image:Crahan All Hope Is Gone DVD.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shawn Crahan]] during the recording sessions of the album]]
Unlike previous releases, all nine band members were involved in the writing process of the album, reportedly writing over 30 songs. Jordison reveals, "I have to say that the band is at its peak; everyone<U+2014>I mean everyone<U+2014>is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing."<ref name="RevAugust"/> When questioned about the process, vocalist Taylor explained that the cycle was not met without conflict. He went on to add that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it, as they realize it is what brings out their creativity.<ref name="CoreyInterview">{{cite web |title = Exclusive Podcast: Slipknot<U+2019>s Corey Taylor Raises the Flag Before Setting it Aflame |publisher = MTV |date = 2008-07-04 |url = http://headbangersblog.mtv.com/2008/07/04/exclusive-podcast-slipknots-corey-taylor-raises-the-flag-before-setting-it-aflame-addresses-mayhem-fest-new-record/ |accessdate = 2008-07-07}}</ref> Also for the first time, some members of the group separated themselves from the band to write some tracks. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist [[James Root|Jim Root]] paired up with turntablist [[Sid Wilson]] (performing on keyboards) and percussionist [[Shawn Crahan]] (who took up full drumming duties) to work on what was described as "oblique, arty pieces."<ref name="RevAugust"/> One experiment saw Taylor tracking in an old well, he enthused, "there was this natural reverb to it that was just intense."<ref name="RevAugust"/> Crahan would later reveal that none of these tracks made it on to the album. However, one of which, "Til We Die" does appear as a bonus track on the special edition.<ref>{{cite web |last = Harris |first = Chris |title = Slipknot's Clown Unmasks Band's Trademark Look: How Often Are Those Masks Cleaned Anyway? |publisher = MTV |date = 2008-07-21 |url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591189/20080718/slipknot.jhtml |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> During an interview with LiveDaily, guitarist Root expressed some discontent over the process of the record, stating that "it felt a little bit rushed. And it felt like we were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." On the subject of the record's producer, Root went on to say, "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer," and that, "[Fortman] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page and, to me, that's the most important thing in making a Slipknot record."<ref> {{citeweb |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/14643.html |title=LiveDaily Interview: Jim Root of Slipknot |accessdate=2008-08-10 |publisher=LiveDaily |date=2008-07-31}}</ref>  In an interview in the October 2008 issue of  ''[[Guitar World]]'', Root went as far as saying that Fortman didn't produce the album, adding; "I'd honestly have to say that he was really just a good engineer. He didn't do what I'm used to with producers."<ref name="GW-oct08">{{cite book |title = The Futility of Hope |publisher = ''[[Guitar World]]'' |date = October 2008 |pages = 61-66}}</ref>  He then again expressed his frustration with the way the album came together, saying "I don't want to make another album the way we made this one; I just don't think it's a good way to make a record.  I might as well have stayed at my house in Florida, and we could have [[FTP]]'d files back and forth."<ref name="GW-oct08"/>

Prior to the release of ''All Hope Is Gone'', copies of the album intended for reviewers were pressed under the false name "Rusty Cage," in order to reduce risks of the album [[Internet leak|leaking]] to the [[Internet]] early.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://www.thrashhits.com/2008/08/album-slipknot-all-hope-is-gone/ |title=Album: Slipknot - All Hope Is Gone |accessdate=2008-08-20 |publisher=Thrash Hits |date=2008-08-13}}</ref>

It rumored that, due to the members being unmasked in their side projects, Slipknot was going to be recording and touring this album unmasked.

Taylor, whose lyrics have traditionally been about his life, stated this album's lyrics will be less about his life and more, "bitching about what's wrong in life."<ref name=RipFace/> Crahan said that the album is different than their first three because it was made "by a bunch of crazy guys in their 30s.

==Reception==
Anticipation for the band's fourth studio album began upon the release of Slipknot's previous album, ''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)'', when [[Allmusic]] stated, "there's a sense that whatever Slipknot do next might be their ultimate broadcast to the faithful."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dnfuxqtaldfe~T1|title= Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses - Review|accessdate=2008-06-15 |author= Johnny Loftus|date= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The percussive edge on the album was praised by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Chris Steffen, "the band<U+2019>s multiple percussionists generate a din that<U+2019>s more suffocating than ever" on the track "Gematria." He went on to propose that "Snuff" the "most melodic" song on the album, comparing it to "''Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s" "Circle." The album's second single, "Psychosocial," "is capped off with a time-signature shattering guitar/drum breakdown that will leave the best air-instrumentalists stumped."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/06/20/new-slipknot-album-a-first-listen-to-all-hope-is-gone/|title= New Slipknot Album: A First Listen to <U+201C>All Hope Is Gone<U+201D>|accessdate=2008-06-23 |author= Chris Steffen|date= 2008-06-08|work= |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The album was praised by ''[[Total Guitar]]'' writer Nick Cracknell, who declared the effort, "Slipknot's heaviest and most aggressive work to date," comparing "Dead Memories" to the works of [[Alice in Chains]], while praising "Gehenna" for being the band's "most experimental work in their history."
