'''The Amenta''' are an [[Industrial metal|industrial]]/[[experimental metal]]
band formed in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 2000.<ref name="Rivadavia">Rivadavia, Ed [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=THE|AMENTA&sql=11:dbfyxq8aldfe~T1 The Amenta Biography], Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation</ref>

They made an EP in 2002, ''Mictlan'', and followed with ''Occasus'', which won them acclaim from rock magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'': they were awarded Best Metal Newcomers for 2004. The album also drew comparisons to bands such as [[Zyklon (band)|Zyklon]] and [[Cryptopsy]].<ref name="Rivocc">Rivadavia, Ed [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:j9fuxqwsldse~T1 ''Occasus'' Review], Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation</ref> In May 2006 the band replaced their singer, and have since played several live shows, most notably on the [[Festival of the Dead]] national tour with [[Akercocke]] and [[The Berzerker]]. In 2007, they supported [[Blackened death metal]] giants [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]] on their national tour, and released the Virus DVD as an extra with the limited re-release of ''Occasus/Mictlan''.

The new album entitled ''n0n'' was released in October 2008. The album features guest appearances from Jason Mendonca of [[Akercocke]], Nergal of [[Behemoth]], Alice Daquet of [[Sir Alice]], and Alex Pope of [[Ruins (band)|Ruins]]. The album was described in ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' as "industrial metal for people who ''actually'' like both industrial and metal".<ref name="Boniwell">Boniwell, Alex (2008) "The Amenta - ''n0n''" (review), ''Terrorizer'' 176 (Nov 2008)</ref> The Amenta are to tour Europe in January 2009 with [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]].<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=107604 The Amenta Added to DEICIDE's European Tour ], Blabbermouth.net</ref>.
