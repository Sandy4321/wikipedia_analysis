The history of the term ''conatus'' is that of a series of subtle tweaks in meaning and clarifications of scope developed over the course of two and a half millennia. Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept, each developing the term differently such that it now has no concrete and universally accepted definition.<ref name="Wolf" /> The earliest authors to discuss ''conatus'' wrote primarily in Latin, basing their usage on [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concepts. These thinkers therefore used "''conatus''" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense. In archaic texts, the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one, and they are also hard to differentiate in translation. In [[English (language)|English]] translations, the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by ''conatus'' in brackets.<ref name="Leib89">{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1989|p=118}}</ref> Today, ''conatus'' is rarely used in the technical sense, since modern physics uses concepts such as [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]] that have superseded it. It has, however, been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

==Classical origins==
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
The Latin ''[[wikt:conatus|c<U+014D>n<U+0101>tus]]'' comes from the verb ''[[wikt:conor|c<U+014D>nor]]'', which is usually translated into English as, "to endeavor"; but the concept of the ''conatus'' was first developed by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] (333&ndash;264 BCE) and [[Peripatetics]] (c. 335 BCE) before the [[Common Era]]. These groups used the word {{polytonic|[[wikt:<U+1F41><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03AE>|<U+1F41><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03AE>]]}} (''horm<U+00EA>'', translated in Latin by ''[[impetus]]'') to describe the movement of the soul towards an object, and from which a physical act results.<ref>[[Clement of Alexandria]], in SVF, III, 377; [[Cicero]], ''[[De Officiis]]'', I, 132; [[Seneca the Younger]], ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'', 113, 23</ref> Classical thinkers, [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] (106&ndash;43 BCE) and [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 235 BCE), expanded this principle to include an aversion to destruction, but continued to limit its application to the motivations of non-human animals. Diogenes Laertius, for example, specifically denied the application of the term to plants. Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c. 1225&ndash;1274 CE), [[Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266&ndash;1308 CE) and [[Dante Alighieri]] (1265<U+2013>1321 CE) expressed similar sentiments using the Latin words ''vult'', ''velle'' or ''appetit'' as synonyms of ''conatus''; indeed, all four terms may be used to translate the original Greek {{polytonic|''<U+1F41><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03AE>''}}. Around 1700, [[Telesius]] and [[Tommaso Campanella|Campanella]] extended the ancient Greek notions and applied them to all objects, animate and inanimate.<ref>{{Harvnb| Wolfson|1934|pp=196,199,202}}</ref>

First [[Aristotle]], then Cicero and Laertius each alluded to a connection between the ''conatus'' and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it "good", but rather they think it "good" because they want to do it. In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the ''conatus''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=204}}</ref>

==Medieval views==
{{see|Theory of impetus}}
{{see also|Scholasticism|Medieval philosophy}}
There is a traditional connection between ''conatus'' and motion itself. Aquinas and [[Judah Leon Abravanel|Abravanel]] (1265<U+2013>1321) both related the concept directly to that which [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (354&ndash;430 CE) saw to be the "natural movements upward and downward or with their being balanced in an intermediate position" described in his ''[[De Civitate Dei]]'', (c. 520 CE). They called this force that causes objects to rise or fall, "''amor naturalis''", or "natural love".<ref> {{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|pp=197,200}}</ref>

In the 6th century, [[John Philoponus]] (c. 490&ndash;c. 570 CE) criticized Aristotle's view of motion, noting the inconsistency between Aristotle's discussion of projectiles, where the medium of [[aether (classical element)|aether]] keeps projectiles going, and his discussion of the void, where there is no such medium and hence a body's motion should be impossible. Philoponus proposed that motion was not maintained by the action of some surrounding medium but by some property, or ''conatus'' implanted in the object when it was set in motion. This was not the modern concept of inertia, for there was still the need for an inherent power to keep a body in motion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorabji|1988|pp=227,228}}</ref> This view was strongly opposed by [[Averro<U+00EB>s]] and many [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers who supported Aristotle.<ref name="Leaman">{{Harvnb|Leaman|1997}}</ref> The Aristotelian view was also challenged in the Islamic world. For example, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) seems to have supported Philoponus' views,<ref>{{Harvnb|Sabra|1994|pp=133&ndash;136}}</ref> while he developed a concept similar to [[inertia]].<ref name=salam>{{Harvnb|Salam|1984 (1987)|pp=179&ndash;213}}</ref> His contemporary [[Avicenna]] also developed a concept similar to [[momentum]].<ref name = sayili/>

<blockquote>
Thus he considered impetus as proportional to weight times velocity. In other words, his conception of impetus comes very close to the concept of momentum of Newtonian mechanics.<ref name=sayili>{{Harvnb|Sayili|1987|pp=447&ndash;482}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Later, [[Jean Buridan]] (1300&ndash;1358) rejected the notion that this motion-generating property, which he named ''impetus'', dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by the resistance of the air and the weight of the body which would oppose its impetus. He also maintained that impetus increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of impetus was similar in many ways to the modern concept of [[momentum]]. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other [[peripatetic]] views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that impetus could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grant|1964|pp=265&ndash;292}}></ref>

==In Descartes==
{{seealso|Ren<U+00E9> Descartes}}
[[Image:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren<U+00E9> Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes]]]]
In the first half of the seventeenth century, Ren<U+00E9> Descartes (1596&ndash;1650) began to develop a more modern, [[materialism|materialistic]] concept of the ''conatus'', describing it as "an active power or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God".<ref name="Piet">{{Harvnb|Pietarinen|2000}}</ref> Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] sense similar to voluntary "endeavoring" or "struggling" to achieve certain ends, and medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers developed a notion of ''conatus'' as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] sense.<ref>{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=150,154}}</ref> More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of ''conatus'', one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goukroger|1980|pp=178&ndash;179}}</ref>

Descartes rejects the [[teleology|teleological]], or purposive, view of the material world that was dominant in the West from the time of Aristotle.<!--Steve Nadler refutes the use of "despite" here--> The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the whole thing in motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grant|1981|pp=140&ndash;44}}</ref> The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no ''new'' motion or rest can be created or destroyed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gueroult|1980|pp=120&ndash;34}}</ref>

Descartes specifies two varieties of the ''conatus'': ''conatus a centro'' and ''conatus recedendi''. ''Conatus a centro'', or "tendency towards the center", is used by Descartes as a theory of [[gravity]]; ''conatus recendendi'', or "tendency away from the center", represents the [[centrifugal force]]s.<ref name="Koll" /> These tendencies are not to be thought of in terms of animate dispositions and intentions, nor as inherent properties or "forces" of things, but rather as a unifying, external characteristic of the physical universe itself which God has bestowed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Garber|1992|pp=180,184}}</ref>

Descartes, in developing his First Law of Nature, also invokes the idea of a ''conatus se movendi'', or "''conatus'' of self-preservation".<ref>{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=201}}</ref> This law is a generalization of the principle of [[inertia]], which was developed and experimentally demonstrated earlier by [[Galileo]]. The principle was formalized by [[Isaac Newton]] and made into the first of his three [[Laws of Motion]] fifty years after the death of Descartes. Descartes' version states: "Each thing, insofar as in it lies, always perseveres in the same state, and when once moved, always continues to move."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blackwell|1966|p=220}}</ref>

==In Hobbes==
{{seealso|Thomas Hobbes}}
[[Image:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]
===Conatus and the psyche===
Thomas Hobbes (1588&ndash;1679), too, worked off of the previous notions of the ''conatus'' principle. However, he criticized the previous definitions for failing to explain the origin of motion. Working toward this end became the primary focus of Hobbes' work in this area. Indeed, Hobbes "reduces all the cognitive functions of the mind to variations of its ''conative'' functions".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=91}}</ref>

Furthermore, Hobbes describes [[emotion]] as the beginning of motion and the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] as the sum of all emotions. This "will" forms the ''conatus'' of a body<ref name="Piet" /> and its physical manifestation is the perceived "will to survive".<ref name="LeB" /> In order that living beings may thrive, Hobbes says, "they seek peace and fight anything that threatens this peace".<ref name="Piet" /> Hobbes also equates this ''conatus'' with "imagination", and states that a change in the ''conatus'', or will, is the result of "deliberation".<ref>{{Harvnb|Schmitter|2006}}</ref>

===Conatus and physics===
<blockquote>
I define [''conatus''] to be motion made in less space and time then can be given; that is, less then can be determined or assigned by exposition or number; that is, motion made through the length of a point, and in an instant or point of time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hobbes|III, xiv, 2}}</ref>
</blockquote>

As in his psychological theory, Hobbes's physical ''conatus'' is an infinitesimal unit of motion. It is the ''beginning'' of motion: an inclination in a specified direction. The concept of ''[[Inertia#Theory of impetus|impetus]]'', as used by Hobbes, is defined in terms of this physical ''conatus''. It is "a measure of the ''conatus'' exercised by a moving body over the course of time".<ref>{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=22}}</ref> [[Friction|Resistance]] is caused by a contrary ''conatus''; [[force]] is this motion plus <U+201C>the magnitude of the body<U+201D>.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jesseph|2006|p=35}}</ref> Hobbes also uses the word ''conatus'' to refer to the "restorative forces" which may cause [[Spring (device)|springs]], for example, to contract or expand. Hobbes claims there is some force inherent in these objects that inclines them to return to their previous state. Today, science attributes this phenomenon to material [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].<ref name="Osler">{{Harvnb|Osler|2001|pp=157&ndash;61}}</ref>

==In Spinoza==
{{seealso|Baruch Spinoza}}
[[Image:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Baruch Spinoza|Benedictus de Spinoza]]]]
Spinoza (1632&ndash;1677) applies the idea of a ''conatus'' to the human body, psyche and both simultaneously, using a different term for each.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wolfson|1934|p=199}}</ref> When referring to psychological manifestations of the concept, he uses the term ''voluntas'' (will). When referring to the overarching concept, he uses the word ''appetitus'' (appetite). When referring to the bodily impulse, he uses the plain term ''conatus''.<ref name="Allison1">{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=126}}</ref> Sometimes he expands the term and uses the whole phrase, ''conatus sese conservandi'' (the striving for self-preservation).<ref>{{Harvnb|Duff|1903|loc=chp. VII}}</ref>

Spinoza asserts the existence of this general principle of a ''conatus'' in attempting to explain the "self-evident" truth that "nothing can be destroyed except by an external cause".<ref>{{Harvnb|Spinoza|1677|Book III Prop 4}}</ref> To him, it is self-evident that "the definition of anything affirms, and does not negate, the thing's essence".<ref>{{Harvnb|Spinoza|1677|p=66}}</ref> This resistance to self-destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a human striving to continue to exist; and ''conatus'' is the word he most often uses to describe this force.<ref>{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=124}}</ref>

In Spinoza's world-view, this principle is applicable to all things, and furthermore constitutes the very essence of objects, including the human mind and morals, for these are but finite modes of God.<ref name="Lin">{{Harvnb|Lin|2004|p=4}}</ref> As he states in the ''Ethics'' (1677), the ''conatus'' is of "indefinite time"; it lasts as long as the object does.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spinoza|1677|pp=66&ndash;7}}</ref> Spinoza uses ''conatus'' to describe an inclination of things to increase in power; rather than just continuing to exist statically, all beings must strive towards perfection.<ref name="Allison1"/> Further, all existing things act [[if and only if]] such action maintains or augments their existence.<ref name="Lin" /> Spinoza also uses the term ''conatus'' to refer to rudimentary concepts of [[inertia]], as Descartes had earlier.<ref name="LeB" /> Since a thing cannot be destroyed without the action of external forces, motion and rest, too, exist indefinitely until disturbed.<ref name="All">{{Harvnb|Allison|1975|p=125}}</ref>

===Psychological manifestation===
The concept of the ''conatus'', as used in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s [[philosophy]] of [[psychology]], is derived from sources both ancient and medieval. Spinoza reformulates principles that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Morgan|2006|p=ix}}</ref> One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the ''conatus ad motum'', (''conatus'' to motion), is ''not'' mental, but material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=93}}</ref>

Spinoza, with his [[determinism]], believes that man and nature must be unified under a consistent set of laws; [[God]] and [[nature]] are one, and there is no [[free will]]. Contrary to most philosophers of his time and in accordance with most of those of the present, Spinoza rejects the dualistic assumption that mind, [[intentionality]], ethics, and freedom are to be treated as things separate from the natural world of physical objects and events.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jarrett|1991|pp=470&ndash;475}}</ref> His goal is to provide a unified explanation of all these things within a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] framework, and his notion of ''conatus'' is central to this project. For example, an action is "free", for Spinoza, only if it arises from the essence and ''conatus'' of an entity. There can be no absolute, unconditioned freedom of the will, since all events in the natural world, including human actions and choices, are [[determinism|determined]] in accord with the natural laws of the universe, which are inescapable. However, an action can still be free in the sense that it is not constrained or otherwise subject to external forces.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lachterman|1978}}</ref>

Human beings are thus an integral part of nature.<ref name="All" /> Spinoza explains seemingly irregular human behaviour as really "natural" and rational and motivated by this principle of the ''conatus''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dutton|2006|loc= chp. 5}}</ref> In the process, he replaces the notion of free will with the ''conatus'', a principle that can be applied to all of nature and not just man.<ref name="All" />

====Emotions and affects====
Spinoza's view of the relationship between the ''conatus'' and the human [[affect (psychology)|affects]] is not clear. [[Firmin DeBrabander]], assistant professor of philosophy at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]], and [[Antonio Damasio]], professor of [[neuroscience]] at the [[University of Southern California]], both argue that the human affects arise from the ''conatus'' and the perpetual drive toward perfection.<ref>{{Harvnb|DeBrabander|2007|p=20&ndash;1}}</ref> Indeed, Spinoza states in his ''Ethics'' that happiness, specifically, "consists in the human capacity to preserve itself". This "endeavor" is also characterized by Spinoza as the "foundation of [[virtue]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=170}}</ref> Conversely, a person is saddened by anything that opposes his ''conatus''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|pp=138&ndash;9}}</ref>

The late [[David Bidney]] (1908&ndash;1987), professor at [[Yale University]], disagrees. Bidney closely associates "desire", a primary affect, with the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza. This view is backed by the Scholium of IIIP9 of the ''Ethics'' which states, "Between appetite and desire there is no difference, except that desire is generally related to men insofar as they are conscious of the appetite. So desire can be defined as appetite together with consciousness of the appetite."<ref name="LeB" /> According to Bidney, this desire is controlled by the other affects, pleasure and pain, and thus the ''conatus'' strives towards that which causes joy and avoids that which produces pain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=87}}</ref> [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788&ndash;1860) agrees with Bidney in interpretation, but states in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819) that he disagrees with Spinoza because "according to the whole of my fundamental view, all this is a reversal of the true relation. The will is first and original; knowledge is merely added to it as an instrument belonging to the phenomenon of the will."<ref>{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=292}}</ref>

|quote=[''Conatus''] is to motion as a point is to space, or as one to infinity, for it is the beginning and end of motion.
|source= <ref name="Art98">{{Harvnb|Arthur|1998}}</ref>}}
Gottfried Leibniz (1646&ndash;1716) was a student of [[Erhard Weigel]] (1625&ndash;1699) and learned of the ''conatus'' principle from him and from Hobbes, though Weigel used the word ''tendentia'' (Latin: tendency).<ref name="Art98" /> Specifically, Leibniz uses the word ''conatus'' in his ''Exposition and Defence of the New System'' (1695) to describe a notion similar that of Hobbes, but he differentiates between the ''conatus'' of the body and soul, the first of which may only travel in a straight line by its own power, and the latter of which may "remember" more complicated motions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leibniz|1988|p=135}}</ref>

For Leibniz, the problem of motion comes to a resolution of the [[paradox of Zeno]].
Since motion is continuous, space must be infinitely divisible. In order for anything to begin moving at all, there must be some mind-like, voluntaristic property or force inherent in the basic constituents of the universe that propels them. This ''conatus'' is a sort of instantaneous or "virtual" motion that all things possess, even when they are static. Motion, meanwhile, is just the summation of all the ''conatuses'' that a thing has, along with the interactions of things. The ''conatus'' is to motion as a point is to space.<ref name="Gill">{{Harvnb|Gillespie|1971|pp=159&ndash;161}}</ref> The problem with this view is that an object that collides with another would not be able to bounce back, if the only force in play were the ''conatus''. Hence, Leibniz was forced to postulate the existence of an [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that kept objects moving and allowed for elastic collisions. Leibniz' concept of a mind-like memory-less property of ''conatus'', coupled with his rejection of [[atom]]s, eventually led to his theory of [[monads]].<ref name="Carl">{{Harvnb|Carlin|2004|pp=365&ndash;379}}</ref>

Leibniz also uses his concept of a ''conatus'' in developing the principles of the [[integral calculus]], adapting the meaning of the term, in this case, to signify a mathematical analog of Newton's accelerative "[[force]]". By summing an infinity of such ''conatuses'' (i.e., what is now called [[integral|integration]]), Leibniz could measure the effect of a continuous force.<ref name="Gill" /> He defines ''[[impetus]]'' as the result of a continuous summation of the ''conatus'' of a body, just as the ''[[vis viva]]'' (or "living force") is the sum of the inactive ''[[vis mortua]]''.<ref name="Duch">{{Harvnb|Duchesneau|1998|pp=88&ndash;89}}</ref>

Based on the work of Kepler and probably Descartes, Leibniz develops a model of planetary motion based on the ''conatus'' principle, the idea of aether and a fluid [[vortex]]. This theory is expounded in the work ''Tentamen de motuum coelestium causis'' (1689).<ref name="Gill" /> According to Leibniz, Kepler's analysis of elliptical orbits into a circular and a radial component can be explained by a "harmonic vortex" for the circular motion combined with a centrifugal force and gravity, both of which are examples of ''conatus'', to account for the radial motion.<ref name="Carl" /> Leibniz later defines the term ''monadic conatus'', as the "state of change" through which his monads perpetually advance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arthur|1994|loc=sec. 3}}</ref>

==Related usages and terms==
[[Image:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]]]
Several other uses of the term ''conatus'', apart from the primary ones mentioned above, have been formulated by various philosophers over the centuries. There are also some important related terms and concepts which have, more or less, similar meanings and usages. [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668&ndash;1744) defined ''conatus'' as the essence of human [[society]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Goulding|2005|p=22040}}</ref> and also, in a more traditional, [[hylozoism|hylozoistic]] sense, as the generating power of movement which pervades all of nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vico|1710|pp=180<U+2013>186}}</ref> Nearly a century after the beginnings of modern science, Vico, inspired by [[Neoplatonism]], explicitly rejected the principle of inertia and the laws of motion of the new physics. For him, nature was composed neither of atoms, as in the dominant view, nor of extension, as in Descartes, but of ''metaphysical points'' animated by a ''conatus'' principle provoked by God.<ref>{{Harvnb|Landucci|2004|pp=1174,1175}}</ref>

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788&ndash;1860) developed a philosophy that contains a principle notably similar to that of Hobbes's ''conatus''. This principle, ''Wille zum Leben'', or "Will to Live", described the specific phenomenon of an organism's self-preservation instinct.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rabenort|1911|p=16}}</ref> Schopenhauer qualified this, however, by suggesting that the Will to Live is not limited in duration. Rather, "the will wills absolutely and for all time", across generations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schopenhauer|1958|p=568}}</ref> [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844&ndash;1900), an early disciple of Schopenhauer, developed a separate principle which comes out of a rejection of the primacy of Schopenhauer's Will to Live and other notions of self-preservation. He called his version the [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]], or ''Wille zur Macht''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Durant|Durant|1963|loc=chp. IX}}</ref> <!--Nietzsche criticized Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle, arguing that if true, it would allegedly favour a stagnant Universe. He thought "the opposite is true"; every organism strives not to just to persevere, but to "become more" than it is and to exert its creative strength. Spinoza's conatus, however, was much more alike to such an understanding than to simple self-preservation, as it was akin to empowerment. DIFFICULT TO SOURCE: SEE TALK PAGE-->

[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856&ndash;1939), greatly depended on Spinoza's formulation of the ''conatus'' principle as a system of self preservation, though he never cited him directly in any of his published works.<ref>{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=260}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=398}}</ref> Around the same time, [[Henri Bergson]] (1859&ndash;1941), developed the principle of the ''[[<U+00E9>lan vital]]'', or "vital impulse", which was thought to aid in the [[evolution]] of [[organism]]s. This concept, which implies a fundamental driving force behind all life, is reminiscent of the ''conatus'' principle of Spinoza and others.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schrift|2006|p=13}}</ref>

The [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]] (1911&ndash;1988), described a ''cultural conatus'' built directly upon Spinoza's seminal definition in IIIP3<!--reread this book--> of his ''Ethics''.

===Physical===
After the advent of Newtonian physics, the concept of a ''conatus'' of all physical bodies was largely superseded by the principle of [[inertia]] and [[conservation of momentum]]. As Bidney states, "It is true that logically desire or the ''conatus'' is merely a principle of inertia&nbsp;...&nbsp;the fact remains, however, that this is not Spinoza's usage."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962|p=88}}</ref> Likewise, ''conatus'' was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. ''Conatus recendendi'', for instance, became the centrifugal force, and [[gravity]] is used where ''conatus a centro'' had been previously.<ref name="Koll" /> Today, the topics with which ''conatus'' dealt are matters of [[science]] and are thus subject to inquiry by the [[scientific method]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bidney|1962}}</ref>

===Biological===
The archaic concept of ''conatus'' is today being reconciled with modern biology by scientists such as [[Antonio Damasio]].<!--psychology and philosophy. --> The ''conatus'' of today, however, is explained in terms of chemistry and neurology where, before, it was a matter of metaphysics and [[theurgy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=37}}</ref> This concept may be "constructed so as to maintain the coherence of a living [[organism]]'s structures and functions against numerous life-threatening odds".<ref>{{Harvnb|Damasio|2003|p=36}}</ref> This ''conatus'' is similar to modern notions of the [[libido]] in the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] sense, and the animal directive of [[self-preservation]].

====Systems theory====
The Spinozistic conception of a ''conatus'' was a historical precursor to modern theories of [[autopoiesis]] in biological systems.<ref name=ziemke6>{{Harvnb|Ziemke|2007|pp=6}}</ref> In [[systems theory]] and the [[sciences]] in general, the concept of a ''conatus'' may be related to the phenomenon of [[emergence]], whereby [[complex systems]] may spontaneously form from a multiplicity of more simple structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's ''conatus'' principle;<ref name=sandy144145>{{Harvnb|Sandywell|1996|pp=144&ndash;5}}</ref> however, the scope of the idea is definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.<ref name=matthews110>{{Harvnb|Matthews|1991|pp=110}}</ref>
