The '''Cerne Abbas Giant''' is a [[hill figure]] near the village of [[Cerne Abbas]] in [[Dorset]], [[England]]. Made by a turf-cut outline filled with chalk, it depicts a large, naked man, typically described as a [[giant (mythology)|giant]], wielding a club. The figure is listed as a [[scheduled monument]] in the United Kingdom and the site where he stands is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

The figure has been the subject of much study and speculation, but its origin and age are unclear. It is often thought of as an ancient construction, though the earliest mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a [[Saxons|Saxon]] deity, while other scholars sought to identify it with a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Britons (historical)|British]] figure or the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Heracles|Hercules]], or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. However the lack of earlier descriptions leads modern scholars to conclude that it may date from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.

Regardless of its age, the Cerne Abbas Giant has become an important part of local culture and folklore, which often associates it with [[fertility]]. It is one of England's best known hill figures and is a major visitor attraction in the region.

==History==
===Early accounts===
Like several other chalk figures carved into the English countryside, the Cerne Abbas Giant is often thought of as an ancient creation. However, as with many of the other figures, its history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the [[British Iron Age|Celtic]], [[Roman Britain|Roman]] or even [[Early Medieval]] periods difficult to demonstrate. Medieval sources do refer to the hill the giant is now on, calling it Trendle Hill - perhaps a reference to the nearby landmark known as the Trendle.<ref name="hiddenhistory2009" /><ref name=hutchins/> Joseph Bettey noted that none of the earlier sources for the area, including a detailed 1617 land survey, refer to the giant, suggesting that it may not have been there at the time.<ref name="bettey1981">J. H. Bettey, "The Cerne Abbas giant: the documentary evidence", ''Antiquity'', [http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/055/214/default.htm Vol.55, No.214], July 1981, pages 118.</ref> In contrast, the [[Uffington White Horse]] has been shown to be 3,000 years old, and there are references to it, across the ages.<ref>Martin Symington, ''Sacred Britain: A Guide to Places that Stir the Soul'', publisher: Bradt Travel Guides, 2012, ISBN 1841623636, 9781841623634, 240 pages, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KTXOGXztZ-MC&lpg=PA53&dq=cerne%20giant%20uffington&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q=cerne%20giant%20uffington%20white%20horse&f=false page 53]</ref>

===Interpretation===
[[File:Cerne Abbas Giant (obliterated section restored).svg|thumb|Layout of the giant with the obliterated line (in yellow) reconstructed]]
There are three main ideas concerning the age of the Giant, and who he might represent:<ref>"[http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MNA138903&resourceID=6 Cerne Abbas Giant, Hill-Figure]", National Trust Historic Buildings, Sites and Monuments Record (HBSMR) Number 110511, via the English Heritage Gateway, retrieved 30 October 2012</ref>
#The first argues that because there is no medieval documentary evidence, then the Giant was created in the 17th century, perhaps by [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Lord Holles]] who resided in Cerne Abbas, and perhaps as a parody of Oliver Cromwell.<ref>"[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cerne-giant/ Cerne Giant]", National Trust website, retrieved 30 October 2012</ref>
#The second idea is that the Giant dates to the time of the Romans in Britain (i.e. [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]]) because the Giant resembles the  Roman god [[Hercules]], who was based on the Greek god [[Heracles]].
#The third idea is that the Giant is of [[Celts|Celtic]] origin because it is stylistically similar to a Celtic god on a [[Frying pan|skillet]] handle found at [[Hod Hill]], Dorset, and dated to around  AD 10 to AD 51.

Proponents of a 17th-century origin suggest that the giant was carved during the [[English Civil War]] by servants of the [[Lord of the Manor]], [[Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles|Denzil Holles]], and was intended as a [[parody]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]].<ref name="sd">[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/england/cerne-abbas-giant.htm Cerne Abbas Giant at Sacred Destinations]</ref>Cromwell was sometimes mockingly referred to as "England's Hercules" by his enemies. The Hercules connection is strengthened by the 1996 discovery of the cloak, as Hercules was often depicted with a cloak made from the [[Nemean Lion]]'s skin.<ref name=Koch396/>

===Modern history===
In 1920, the giant and the {{convert|1|acre|m2|abbr=on}} site where he stands was donated to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by its then land-owners, Alexander and George [[Pitt-Rivers]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Grinsell |first1= Leslie |year= 1980 |title= The Cerne Abbas Giant: 1764<U+2013>1980 | journal= Antiquity |volume= 54 |issue= 210 |page= 30 |publisher= |doi= |url= }}</ref> and it is now listed as a [[Scheduled Monument]].<ref>"[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1003202 Hill figure called The Giant]",List entry Number: 1003202, at english-heritage.org.uk, retrieved 20 October 2012</ref> During [[World War II]] the giant was camouflaged with brushwood by the Home Guard in order to prevent use as a landmark for enemy aircraft.<ref>Lucy Cockcroft, "Cerne Abbas giant in danger of disappearing", ''The Telegraph'', 19 June 2008, retrieved 6 October 2012</ref><ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/sep/16/heritage.ruralaffairs Volunteers restore historic giant of Cerne Abbas to his former glory]", ''The Guardian'', Tuesday 16 September 2008, retrieved 6 October 2012</ref>

In 1921 Walter Long of [[Gillingham, Dorset]] objected to the giant's nudity and conducted a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed obscenity with a leaf.<ref>Temple Willcox, "Hard times for the Cerne Giant: 20th-century attitudes to an ancient monument" ([http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/062/Ant0620524.htm abstract]), ''Antiquity'', Vol.62 No.236, September 1988, page 524</ref> Long's protest gained some traction, including the support of two bishops,<ref name="antiquity1976">"Editorial: regarding the Home Office file, Obscene Publications: the Cerne Abbas Giant ([http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C4768357 PRO HO 45/18033])", ''Antiquity'', [http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/050/198/default.htm Vol.50 No.198], June 1976, pages 93-94</ref><ref name="Barnett2000">Antony Barnett, "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/mar/05/antonybarnett.theobserver Bishop tried to gird the giant's loins]", ''The Observer'', 5 March 2000</ref> and eventually reached the Home Office.<ref name="antiquity1976" /> The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.<ref name="antiquity1976" />

===Archaeology===
[[File:Ercole - Museo archeol. di MI - foto GD'O - 26-6-2003.JPG|thumb|right|Roman god Hercules holding a club and the [[Nemean lion]]-skin fur]]
A 1617 land survey of Cerne Abbas makes no mention of the Giant, suggesting that it may not have been there at the time.<ref name="bettey1981" /> The first published survey appeared in the September 1763 issue of ''Royal Magazine'',  reprinted in the October 1763 issue of ''St James Chronicle'', and also in the August 1764 edition of ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]'' together with the first drawing that included measurments.<ref name=Evans/>

Egyptologist and archaeology pioneer, Sir [[Flinders Petrie]],<ref>Brian Fagan, ''Archaeologists: Explorers of the Human Past'', Oxford University Press, 2003, ISBN 0195119460, 9780195119466, 192 pages, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nAfJ1xBD664C&lpg=PA72&dq=Egyptologist%20archaeology%20pioneer%2C%20Flinders%20Petrie&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q=Egyptologist%20archaeology%20pioneer,%20Flinders%20Petrie&f=false page 72]</ref> surveyed the Giant probably during the First World War, and published his results in a [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] paper in 1926.<ref>Leslie Grinsel, "The Cern Abbas Giant 1764<U+2013>1980", ''Antiquity'', [http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/054/210/default.htm Vol.54 No.210], March 1980, page 29</ref><ref name="petrie1926">W.

He also notes a row of pits suggesting the place of the spine. He concludes that the Giant is very different from that of the [[Long Man of Wilmington]], and that from having been repeatedly cleaned, minor grooves may have been added.<ref name="petrie1926" />

In 1764, [[William Stukeley]] was one of the first people to suggest that the Giant resembles [[Hercules]] (Heracles).<ref name="stukeley1764" /> In 1938,  British archaeologist [[Stuart Piggott]] agreed, and like Hercules, should also be carrying a lion-skin.<ref>Stuart Piggott, "The Hercules Myth<U+2014>beginnings and ends", ''Antiquity'' [http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/012/47/default.htm Vol.12 No.47], September 1938, Pages 326<U+2013>327</ref><ref>Julia De Wolf Addison, ''Classic Myths in Art: An Account of Greek Myths as Illustrated by Great Artists'', Reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2003 ISBN 0766176703, 9780766176706, 360 pages, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LkCjlir-ITgC&lpg=PA188&dq=hercules%20club%20lion%20skin%20illustrated&pg=PA188#v=onepage&q=hercules%20club%20lion%20skin%20illustrated&f=false page 188]</ref> In 1979, a resistivity survey was carried out, and together with drill samples, confirmed the presence of the lion-skin.<ref>"Cerne Giant", 1979 Resistivity survey by A J Clark, A D H Bartlett and A E U David,English Heritage, [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1836072 National Monuments Record 1058724]</ref> Another resistivity survey in 1995 also found evidence of a cloak and changes to the length of the phallus, but did not find evidence (as rumoured) of a severed head, horns, or symbols between the feet.<ref>"Cerne Giant", 1995 Resistivity survey by A J Clark, A D H Bartlett and A E U David,English Heritage, [http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1870505 1066313]</ref>

====Earthworks====
North-east of the head of the Giant is an escarpment called Trendle Hill, on which are some earthworks now called The Trendle or Frying Pan.<ref name="NTADStrendle">"[http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archsearch/record.jsf?titleId=1784533 The Trendle, Possible Roman Rectangular Earthwork Enclosure]", National Trust Archaeological Data Service</ref> It is a scheduled monument in its own right.<ref>"[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1002725 Earthworks on Giant Hill]", List entry Number: 1002725, The National Heritage List for England</ref> Antiquarian John Hutchins wrote in 1872 that "These remains are of very interesting character, and of considerable extent. They consist of circular and other earthworks, lines of defensive ramparts, an avenue, shallow excavations, and other indications of a British settlement.<ref>Hutchins (1742), quoted in Dr Wake Smart, "The Cerne Giant", ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'', Volume: 28, 1872, [http://archive.org/stream/journalofbritish28brit#page/64/mode/2up page 65]</ref>

Unlike the Giant, the earthworks belong to Lord Digby, rather than the National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it is thought to be the site of maypole dancing.<ref name="NTADStrendle" /> It has been considered to be Roman,<ref name="NTADStrendle" /> or perhaps an Iron-Age burial mound containing the tomb of the person represented by the Giant.<ref>James Dyer, ''Southern England: an archaeological guide'', publisher Noyes Press, 1973, pp. 81-82</ref><ref>"[http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=199018 The Trendle]", National Monuments Record Number 199018, English Heritage at pastscape.org.uk, retrieved 25 October 2012</ref>

==Folklore==
Whatever its origin, the giant has become an important part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant.<ref name=Koch396/> One story says the giant came from [[Denmark]] leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept on the hillside.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Social Circulation of the Past: English Historical Culture 1500<U+2013>1730 |last=Woolf |first=Daniel R. |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=0-19-925778-7 |pages=348, footnote 178 }}</ref>

Other folklore, first recorded in the [[Victorian era]], associates the figure with fertility.<ref name=Koch396/> In the past locals would erect a [[maypole]] on the earthwork, around which childless couples would [[fertility rite|dance to promote fertility]].<ref name=Lewis/> According to folk belief, a woman who sleeps on the figure will be blessed with fecundity, and infertility may be cured through sexual intercourse on top of the figure, especially the phallus.<ref name=Koch396/>

In 1808, Dorset poet William Holloway published his poem "The Giant of Trendle Hill",<ref name="holloway" /> in which the Giant is killed by the locals by piercing its heart.

==Media==
[[File:CerneAbbasHomer.jpg|thumb|right|Homer Simpson as promotion for ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.]]
In modern times the giant has been used for several [[publicity stunt]]s and as an [[Advertising|advertisement]]. For example, Ann Bryn-Evans of the Pagan Federation recalls that the Giant has been used to promote "...condoms, jeans and bicycles."<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6901543.stm Wish for rain to wash away Homer]", BBC News, Monday, 16 July 2007</ref>

As a publicity stunt for the opening of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' on the 16 July 2007, a giant [[Homer Simpson]] brandishing a [[doughnut]] was outlined in water-based [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] paint to the left of the Cerne Abbas giant. This act angered local [[Neopaganism|neopagans]], who pledged to perform rain magic to wash the figure away.<ref name="Pagans have a cow over Homer">{{cite news|title=Pagans have a cow over Homer|publisher=The Sun Online |date=16 July 2007|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2007320865,00.html}}</ref><ref name="Wish for rain to wash away Homer">{{cite news|title=Wish for rain to wash away Homer|publisher=BBC News|date=16 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/dorset/6901543.stm}}</ref>

In August 2007 a report in the ''[[Dorset Echo]]'' said that a man claiming to be the "Purple Phantom" had painted the Giant's penis purple. It was reported that the man was from [[Fathers 4 Justice]] but the group said that they did not know who it was.<ref>[http://www.thisisdorset.net/news/tidnews/display.var.1645001.0.giant_daubed_by_vigilante.php Giant daubed by 'vigilante']</ref>
