In [[Norse mythology]], '''Ratatoskr''' ([[Old Norse]], generally considered "drill-tooth"<ref name="DRILL-TOOTH">Orchard (1997:129), Simek (2007:261), and Byock (2005:173).</ref> or "bore-tooth"<ref name="LINDOW259">Lindow (2001:259).</ref>) is a [[squirrel]] who runs up and down the [[world tree]] [[Yggdrasil]] to carry messages between the [[Ve<U+00F0>rf<U+00F6>lnir and eagle|unnamed eagle]], perched atop Yggdrasil, and the [[wyrm]] [[N<U+00ED><U+00F0>h<U+00F6>ggr]], who dwells beneath one of the three roots of the tree. Ratatoskr is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'',  written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the squirrel.

==Etymology==
The name ''Ratatoskr'' contains two elements: ''rata-'' and ''-toskr''. The element ''toskr'' is generally held to mean "tusk". [[Gu<U+00F0>brandur Vigf<U+00FA>sson]] theorized that the ''rati-'' element means "the traveller". Vigf<U+00FA>sson says that the name of the legendary drill [[Rati (Norse mythology)|Rati]] may feature the same term. According to Vigf<U+00FA>sson, ''Ratatoskr'' means "tusk the traveller" or "the climber tusk."<ref name=VIGFUSSON483>Vigfusson (1874:483).</ref>

[[Sophus Bugge]] theorized that the name ''Ratatoskr'' is a loan from [[Old English]] meaning "[[Rat]]-tooth." Bugge's basis hinges on the fact that the ''-toskr'' element of the compound does not appear anywhere else in Old Norse. Bugge proposed that the ''-toskr'' element is a reformation of the Old English word ''t<U+016B>sc'' ([[Old Frisian]] ''tusk'') and, in turn, that the element ''Rata-'' represents Old English ''r<U+00E6>t'' ("rat").<ref name="STURTEVANT111">Sturtevant (1956:111).</ref>

According to Albert Sturtevant, "[as] far as the element ''Rata-'' is concerned, Bugge's hypothesis has no valid foundation in view of the fact that the [Old Norse] word ''Rata'' (gen. form of ''Rati''*) is used in ''[[H<U+00E1>vam<U+00E1>l|H<U+00E1>v[am<U+00E1>l]]]'' (106, 1) to signify the instrument which Odin employed for ''boring'' his way through the rocks in quest of the [[mead of poetry|poet's mead]] [...]" and that "''Rati*'' must then be considered a native [Old Norse] word meaning "The Borer, Gnawer" [...]". <ref name="STURTEVANT111"/>

Sturtevant says that Bugge's theory regarding the element ''-toskr'' may appear to be supported by the fact that the word does not appear elsewhere in Old Norse. Sturtevant, however, disagrees. Sturtevant says that the Old Norse proper name ''Tunne'' (derived from [[Proto-Norse]] ''*Tun<U+00FE><U+0113>'') refers to "a person who is characterized as having some peculiar sort of ''tooth''" and theorizes a [[Proto-Germanic]] form of ''-toskr''. Sturtevant concludes that "the fact that the [Old Norse] word occurs only in the name ''Rata-toskr'' is no valid evidence against this assumption, for there are many [Old Norse] ''[[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]]'' of native origin, as is attested by the equivalents in the Mod[ern] Scandinavian dialects."<ref name="STURTEVANT111-112">Sturtevant (1956:111<U+2013>112).</ref> Modern scholars have accepted this etymology, listing the name ''Ratatoskr'' as meaning "drill-tooth" (Jesse Byock, Andy Orchard, [[Rudolf Simek]]<ref name="DRILL-TOOTH"/>) or "bore-tooth" ([[John Lindow]]<ref name="LINDOW259"/>).

==Attestations==
[[File:Ekorn.jpg|thumb|A [[red squirrel]] in an evergreen tree in [[Norway]].]]
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l]]'', the god [[Odin]] (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr<U+00ED>mnir]]'') says that Ratatoskr runs up and down Yggdrasil bringing messages between the eagle perched atop it and N<U+00ED><U+00F0>h<U+00F6>ggr below it:
<blockquote>
{|
|
:<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>
:Ratat<U+00F6>sk is the squirrel named, who has run
:in Yggdrasil's ash;
:he from above the eagle's words must carry,
:and beneath the Nidh<U+00F6>gg repeat.<ref name="THORPE23">Thorpe (1907:23).</ref>
|
:<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>
:Ratatosk is the squirrel who there shall run
:On the ash-tree Yggdrasil;
:From above the words of the eagle he bears,
:And tells them to Nithhogg beneath.<ref name="BELLOWS97">Bellows (1936:97).</ref>
|
|}
</blockquote>

In the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Ratatoskr is attested in chapter 16. In the chapter, [[Gangleri]] (described as king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) asks [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] what other notable facts there are to know about Yggdrasil. High's account agrees with the ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l'' attestation but he adds that the messages are slanderous gossip:
<blockquote>
:'There is much to be told. An eagle sits at the top of the ash, and it has knowledge of many things. Between its eyes sits the hawk called Vedrfolnir [...]. The squirrel called Ratatosk [...] runs up and down the ash. He tells slanderous gossip, provoking the eagle and Nidhogg.'<ref name="BYOCK26">Byock (2005:26).</ref>
</blockquote>

==Theories==
According to [[Rudolf Simek]], "the squirrel probably only represents an embellishing detail to the mythological picture of the world-ash in ''Gr<U+00ED>mnism<U+00E1>l''."<ref name="SIMEK261">Simek (2007:261).</ref> [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]], describing the world tree, states the squirrel is said to gnaw at it<U+2014>furthering a continual destruction and re-growth cycle, and posits the tree symbolizes ever-changing existence.<ref name="DAVIDSON68-69">Davidson (1993:68-69).</ref> [[John Lindow]] points out that Yggdrasil is described as rotting on one side and as being chewed on by [[D<U+00E1>inn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Dura<U+00FE>r<U+00F3>r|four harts]] and N<U+00ED><U+00F0>h<U+00F6>ggr, and that, according to the account in ''Gylfaginning'', it also bears verbal hostility in the fauna it supports. Lindow adds that "in the sagas, a person who helps stir up or keep feuds alive by ferrying words of malice between the participants is seldom one of high status, which may explain the assignment of this role in the mythology to a relatively insignificant animal."<ref name="LINDOW259"/>

Richard W. Thorrington Jr. and Katie Ferrell theorize that "the role of Ratatosk probably derived from the habit of European tree squirrels (''[[Red Squirrel|Sciurus vulgaris]]'') to give a scolding alarm call in response to danger. It takes little imagination for you to think that the squirrel is saying nasty things about you."<ref name=THORRINGTONJRFERRELL142>Thorrington Jr. and Ferrel (2006:142).</ref>
