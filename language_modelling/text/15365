==Biography==
Arcadi Gaydamak was born in 1952 in [[Moscow]], the capital of the former [[USSR]]. At the age of 20, Gaydamak was one of the first [[Jew]]s to emigrate to [[Israel]] from [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s Soviet Union and receive Israeli citizenship. He lived in Kibbutz [[Beit HaShita]], learned [[Hebrew]] at an [[Ulpan]]. He was later employed as a sailor by the Israeli national shipping company [[Zim Integrated Shipping Services|ZIM]], and disembarked from one of its ships in [[France]] in 1973. He lived in France until the age of 48 and returned to Israel in 2000{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

==Career==
After Gaydamak settled in France, lacking an academic education, he began his early career working as a gardener and a bricklayer. In 1976, Gaydamak opened a translation bureau near Paris, servicing Russian commercial delegations visiting France and made contacts at a number of French companies. By 1982, Gaydamak Translations was a highly successful business, and he opened a branch in Canada. During that period he commenced international business, in import and export. After the collapse of the [[USSR]], he built up ties in Russia and [[Kazakhstan]] to further his business and sequentially formed various business organizations across Europe. Gaydamak's wealth is currently estimated at between $700 million and $4 billion{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

He was awarded with several honorary rewards from the French government, including the prestigious Order of the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] for obtaining the release of two French pilots from the [[Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb]] government during the [[War in Bosnia]].

During the 1990s, Gaydamak made significant donations to [[Jewish]] and Israeli causes, including the Association for the Welfare of Soldiers in Israel{{Fact|date=October 2008}}.

==Angolagate==
Gaydamak left France after many years, after an international [[arrest warrant]] was issued for him in connection with [[Angolagate]], an arms-dealing scandal. He is wanted on two charges; illegal [[arms dealing]] with [[Angola]], and [[tax evasion]]. France has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain his extradition from Israel, but this has been declined by the Israeli judiciary on the grounds that the factual allegations could not be considered as an offense under the laws of the extraditing country (in this case, Israel) at the time that they were allegedly committed, this being an international prerequisite of extradition, and that other alleged offenses, such as fiscal ones, are not extraditable by nature.

==Sport clubs and media ownership==
In [[July 10]] [[2005]] Gaydamak announced his entry into the sports business and became the sponsor of the [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem]] [[basketball]] team. About a month later he decided to donate $400,000 to the [[Israeli Arab]] [[Bnei Sakhnin F.C.|Bnei Sakhnin]] football club. On the same day Gaydamak also announced the purchase of 55% of the ownership of [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]], and two days later he announced the acquisition of full ownership of the team. Gaydamak is the patron of several Jewish charities, and is president of the Congress of Jewish Religious Communities and Organizations of Russia (KEROOR), Russia's oldest religious Jewish umbrella group. In the summer of 2008, Arcadi appeared to claim that it was him, not his son Alexandre, who was the owner of [[Portsmouth F.C.]] - but this was refuted in statements by both the club itself and the [[Premier League]].<ref name="PLOwnershipStatement"/>

In March 2006 he announced his offer to buy the French newspaper ''[[France Soir]]'' via his company ''[[Moscow News]]''.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3236,36-750525,0.html Arcadi Gaydamak announces having bought back 'France Soir'] Le Monde, 14 March 2006 {{fr icon}}</ref> He had purchased the Russian ''[[Moskovskie Novosti]]'' newspaper in 2004, fired some senior journalists, and changed the paper's mandate to a firmly pro-government one, appointing a pro-Putin journalist as editor in chief. This was widely viewed as hostile to free speech and raised questions about Gaydamak's possible ties to the Kremlin, exactly as predicted by Merabtene Nabil, his colleague from London.<ref>Israel's rising right wing - http://www.saudiinfocus.com/en/show_art_det.asp?artid=975</ref>

==Donations==
Gaydamak has donated to many Israeli organizations, of which many are charity and have religious characteristics. He has donated to [[Magen David Adom]], [[Hatzolah]] and many others.

Gaydamak also pledged  $50 million to the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], but withdrew the offer when the Jewish Agency was warned about money laundering allegations. He ended up donating $10 million.

During the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] Gaydamak constructed a tent-village on the beach of [[Nitzanim]], that hosted thousands of families who fled the rocket ridden North and had otherwise no place and means to go to. Gaydamak's contributions totaled $15 million (about $500,000 a day) and earned him considerable praise among some Israelis, although they were viewed by others as a populist act. 

In November 2006, he funded a one-week long vacation in [[Eilat]] for hundreds of [[Sderot]] residents, who have been under constant [[Qassam rocket|Palestinian rocket attack]] for the past seven years.<ref> {{cite news | title=Sderot residents vie for trip to Eilat|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=2006-11-16|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378411894&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull}}</ref>.

==Politics==
On February 20, 2007 Gaydamak announced he would found a party based solely on socio-economic issues. The next day he announced its name, [[Social Justice (Israel)|Social Justice]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/828813.html Gaydamak announces formation of 'Social Justice' movement] Haaretz, 21 February 2007</ref> 

Although Gaydamak has said the organisation would initially be established as a social movement, he noted that it could become a political party at any time, "based on the circumstances." In the past he has stated that the movement does not seek ultimate power for itself, but will run in tandem with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s [[Likud]], hoping to pick up votes from former Likud members alienated by Netanyahu's financial policies. It is not clear, in early 2008, how relevant that statement is, given that Gaydamak's policies on territorial issues and on the conflict with the [[Palestinians]] appears to be more moderate than those of Netanyahu's Likud (which is the center of the historic Likud, left over after the 1999 break away of [[Benny Begin]]'s [[Herut - The National Movement|Herut]] party and the 2006 split with [[Ariel Sharon]]'s [[Kadima]]).

Gaydamak believes the party could win 25 seats in the next elections. However, he apparently does not wish to take a seat in the [[Knesset]], preferring to run for Mayor of [[Jerusalem]]. In May 2007 he announced that he would run for this position in the October 2008 municipal elections. In late 2007 it became apparent that the party intended to run candidates for mayor and council members in tens of Israeli municipalities and local authorities in the 2008 municipal elections.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/853972.html Billionaire Gaydamak says he'll run for mayor of Jerusalem] Haaretz, 30 April 2007</ref> Gaydamak commands considerable popularity in the Israeli development towns, such as [[Sderot]], in [[Israeli-Arab]], [[Bedouin]] and [[Druze]] towns and villages and in the [[Haredi]] communities,<ref name=HA /> to all of whom he has contributed considerably over the years.

Gaydamak's politics are outreach, encompassing very differing segments of Israeli society. This is uncommon in Israel party politics, which tend to be sectoral by nature, whether or not this characteristic is acknowledged by each party.  Although this outreach has boundaries, as attested in an August 2008 speech where Gaydamak told an audience at a hospital he owns that he is prepared to lie down on the road and risk death to prevent the Jerusalem gay pride parade from taking place again, basing this comment on religious concerns since Jerusalem is the holiest city in the world.
