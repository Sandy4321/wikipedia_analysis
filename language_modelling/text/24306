==History==
The roots of this project lie in the involvement of international oil companies in [[Kazakhstan]] and Turkmenistan beginning of 1990s.  As [[Russia]], who controlled all export pipelines of these countries, consistently refusing to allow the use of its pipeline network, these companies needed an independent export route avoiding both [[Iran]] and Russia.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Brisard |first1= Jean-Charles |first2= Guillaume | last2 = Dasquie |title= Forbidden Truth <U+2013> U.S. Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy and the Failed Hunt for bin Laden |publisher= [[Nation Books]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-1-56025-414-0| pages = ?}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=June 2011}}

The original project started on 15 March 1995 when an inaugural memorandum of understanding between the governments of Turkmenistan and Pakistan for a pipeline project was signed. This project was promoted by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] company [[Bridas Corporation]]. The U.S. company [[Unocal]], in conjunction with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] oil company Delta, promoted alternative project without Bridas' involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a separate agreement with Turkmenistan's president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]]. In August 1996, the [[CentGas|Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas)]] [[consortium]] for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed.  On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the [[Government of Turkmenistan]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Since the pipeline was to pass through Afghanistan, it was necessary to work with the Taliban.  The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, [[Robert Oakley]], moved into CentGas in 1997.  In January 1998, the [[Taliban]], selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor [[Bridas Corporation]], signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian [[Gazprom]] relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed]] under the direction of [[Osama bin Laden]], and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's leader, [[Mohammad Omar]], announced that Osama bin Laden had the Taliban's support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The new deal on the pipeline was signed on 27 December 2002 by the leaders of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.<ref name=bbc1>

Then-US Ambassador to Turkmenistan Ann Jacobsen noted that: "We are seriously looking at the project, and it is quite possible that American companies will join it."<ref name=newint>

On 24 April 2008, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a framework agreement to buy natural gas from Turkmenistan.<ref name=upstream1>

</ref> However, in April 2012, India and Afghanistan have failed to agree on transit fee for gas passing through Afghan territory. Consequently, Islamabad and New Delhi too could not agree on the transit fee for the segment of the pipeline passing through Pakistan, which has linked its fee structure to any India-Afghanistan agreement.<ref>

The Afghan government is expected to earn $350 to $400 million in transit fees from the export of gas per annum. Informed sources told this correspondent that Afghanistan had demanded an increased share.

Finally, in 16 May 2012, [[Meshrano Jirga]], or upper house of parliament of Afghanistan, approved the agreement on a gas pipeline and the day after, the Indian Cabinet allowed state-run gas-firm [[GAIL]] to sign the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) with [[Turkmengas|T<U+00FC>rkmenGaz]], Turkmenistan<U+2019>s national oil company.<ref>

In Afghanistan, the TAPI will be constructed alongside the highway running from [[Herat]] to [[Kandahar]], and then via [[Quetta]] and [[Multan]] in Pakistan. The final destination of the pipeline will be the Indian town of [[Fazilka]], near the border between Pakistan and India.<ref name=alex2/>

For security reasons, the Asian Development Bank had proposed alternative routes in Afghanistan. One alternative was through Taskepri in Turkmenistan to Shebarghan and then through Balakh, [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Samangan, [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]] in Afghanistan, and [[Peshawar]], [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], [[Islamabad]] and [[Lahore]] in Pakistan to India.  Another alternative was a route through [[Serhetabat]], Shindand, [[Delaram]], Kandahar, Quetta, Lora Lai, [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] and [[Multan]].<ref name=dailytimes220203>

The cost of the pipeline is estimated cost at [[United States dollar|US$]]7.6&nbsp;billion.<ref name=upstream1/> The [[Asian Development Bank]] has played a leading role in coordinating and facilitating the TAPI negotiation process. The four TAPI nations must still attract commercial partners to build, finance, and operate the pipeline, estimated in 2008 to cost at least $7.6 billion.<ref>[http://www.adb.org/news/historic-agreements-bring-long-awaited-tapi-pipeline-closer-reality] Historic Agreements Bring Long-Awaited TAPI Pipeline Closer to Reality</ref>

== Gas prices ==

In Turkmenistan, the price will be $9.17/mBTU, in Pakistan it will be $11.50/mBTU, in India it will be $12.99/mBTU.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/turkmenistan-gas-to-cost-13mmbtu/165827/on]</ref>

The price in India includes:

$0.495/mBTU India will pay in transit fees to Afghanistan, plus $0.495/mBTU transit fees to Pakistan,<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/turkmenistan-gas-to-cost-13mmbtu/165827/on]</ref> plus $1/mBTU wheeling charge India will pay to Pakistan plus $1.83/mBTU wheeling charge to Afghanistan.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/turkmenistan-gas-to-cost-13mmbtu/165827/on]</ref>

Energy companies in India have questioned why Government is only paying $4.20/mBTU for Indian gas while paying much more for imported gas at $13/mBTU.<ref>[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/turkmenistan-gas-to-cost-13mmbtu/165827/on]</ref>
