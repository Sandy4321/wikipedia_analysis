The '''Great Northern Loon''' (''Gavia immer''), is a large member of the [[loon]], or diver, [[family]] of birds. The species is known as the '''Common Loon''' in [[North America]] and the '''Great Northern Diver''' in [[Eurasia]]; its current name is a compromise proposed by the [[International Ornithological Committee]].<ref>Gill, F., Wright, M. & Donsker, D. (2009). ''[http://www.worldbirdnames.org/n-penguins.html IOC World Bird Names]'' (version 2.2). Accessed 24 November 2009</ref>

==Taxonomy==
The Great Northern Loon is one of the five [[loon]] species that make up the genus ''Gavia'', the only genus of the family Gavidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is the other large black-headed species, the [[Yellow-billed Loon]] or White-billed Diver, ''Gavia adamsii''.<ref name= Boertmann>{{cite journal | last= Boertmann | first= D.  | coauthors=   | month= | year= 1990 | title= Phylogeny of the divers, family Gaviidae (Aves)  | journal= Steenstrupia | volume= 16 | issue =  | pages= 21&ndash;36 | url = | doi =  }}</ref>

The genus name ''Gavia'' was the [[Latin]] term for the [[Smew]] (''Mergellus albellus''). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and just happens to be another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish. It is not likely that the [[Ancient Romans]] had much knowledge of loons, as these are limited to more northern [[latitude]]s and since the end of the [[last glacial period]] seem to have occurred only as rare winter migrants in the [[Mediterranean]] region.<ref name =brodkorb >[[Pierce Brodkorb|Brodkorb, Pierce]] (1964) "[http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=feol&idno=UF00001514&format=pdf Catalogue of fossil birds.

University of Nebraska Press. (Appendix 1)</ref>

The European name "diver" comes from the bird's habit of catching fish by swimming calmly along the surface and then abruptly plunging into the water. The North American name "loon" is a reference to the bird's clumsiness on land, and is derived from Scandinavian words for lame, such as Icelandic "l<U+00FA>inn" and Swedish "lam". Having large webbed feet, the loons are efficient predators, powerful swimmers, and adroit divers.

==Description==
[[File:Gavia immer -Gull Lake, Haliburton County, Ontario, Canada-8.jpg|left|thumb|Swimming on [[Gull Lake (Ontario)|Gull Lake]], Ontario, Canada]]
[[File:Adirondacks - Great Northern Loon - 03.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile Loon in [[Adirondacks]].]]
Adults can range from {{Convert|61|to|100|cm|abbr = on}} in length with a {{Convert|122|-|152|cm|abbr = on}} wingspan, slightly smaller than the similar [[Yellow-billed Loon]] (or "White-billed Diver"). The weight can vary from {{Convert|1.6|to|8|kg|abbr = on}}. On average, a Great Northern Loon is about {{Convert|81|cm|abbr = on}} long, has a wingspan of {{Convert|136|cm|abbr = on}}, and weighs about {{Convert|4.1|kg|abbr = on}}.

[[Reproduction|Breeding]] [[adults]] have a black head, white underparts, and a checkered black-and-white mantle. Non-breeding [[Feather|plumage]] is brownish, with the chin and foreneck white. The bill is black-blue and held horizontally. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the similar Yellow-billed Loon.

Bone structure: A number of solid bones (unlike normally hollow avian bones), which add weight but help in diving.<ref name="Wisconsin Natural Resources"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The Great Northern Loon breeds in [[North America]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], and [[Great Britain]]. This [[species]] winters on [[sea]] [[coasts]] or on large [[lakes]] of south [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], and south to northwestern areas of [[Africa]].<ref name=BTO>{{cite web|title=Great Northern Diver Gavia immer|url=http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob40.htm|work=Divers|publisher=British Trust for Orinthology|accessdate=12 August 2012}}</ref>

This [[species]], like all divers, is a specialist [[fish]]-eater, catching its prey underwater, diving as deep as {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Wisconsin Natural Resources">{{cite web|title=The Uncommon Loon|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/2013/02/loon.htm|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources|accessdate=2 June 2013}}</ref> Freshwater diets consist of [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[perch]], [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]], [[trout]], and [[bass (fish)|bass]]; salt-water diets consist of [[Sebastes|rock fish]], [[flounder]], [[Brown trout|sea trout]], and [[herring]].

The bird needs a long distance to gain momentum for take-off, and is ungainly on landing. Its clumsiness on land is due to the legs being positioned at the rear of the body: this is ideal for diving but not well-suited for walking. When the birds land on water, they skim along on their bellies to slow down, rather than on their feet, as these are set too far back. The loon swims gracefully on the surface, dives as well as any flying bird, and flies competently for hundreds of kilometers in migration. It flies with its neck outstretched, usually calling a particular tremolo that can be used to identify a flying loon. Its flying speed is about {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}} during migration.<ref name="Wisconsin Natural Resources"/> Its call has been alternately called "haunting," "beautiful," "thrilling," "mystical", and "enchanting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borealforest.org/birds/loon.htm |title=Northwestern Ontario Bird Species - Common Loon |publisher=Borealforest.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref><ref>Feinman, 2010.</ref>

Great Northern Loon nests are usually placed on islands, where ground-based predators cannot normally access them. However, eggs and nestlings have been taken by [[gull]]s, [[corvid]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[mink]]s, [[fox]]es, [[snapping turtle]]s, and large [[fish]]. Adults are not regularly preyed upon, but have been taken by [[sea otter]]s (when wintering) and [[Bald Eagle]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Gavia_immer.html |title=ADW: Gavia immer: Information |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |date=2004-10-06 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> [[Osprey]]s have been observed harassing divers, more likely out of [[kleptoparasitism]] than predation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbaa.ca/projects.asp?cn=303 |title=The Science Behind Algonquin's Animals - Research Projects - Common Loon |publisher=Sbaa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> When approached by a predator of either its nest or itself, divers sometimes attack the predator by rushing at it and attempting to impale it through the abdomen or the back of the head or neck.

===Breeding===

The female lays 1 to 3 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] on a hollowed-out mound of dirt and vegetation very close to [[water]]. Both [[parents]] build the [[bird nest|nest]], sit on the egg or eggs, and feed the young.

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Gavia immer -Maine, USA -nest-8a (4).jpg|upright|right|thumb|upright|Nest near to water in [[Maine]], United States]]
These birds have disappeared from some lakes in eastern [[North America]] due to the effects of [[acid rain]] and [[pollution]], as well as lead poisoning from fishing sinkers and mercury contamination from industrial waste. Artificial floating nesting platforms have been provided for loons in some [[lakes]] to reduce the impact of changing water levels due to [[dam]]s and other human activities.

The Great Northern Loon is one of the [[species]] to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.

==In popular culture==
This diver is well known in [[Canada]], appearing on the [[Loonie|one-dollar "loonie"]] [[coin]] and the previous series of [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|$20 bill]], and is the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of [[Ontario]]. Also, it is the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]] of [[Minnesota]].

The voice and appearance of the Great Northern Loon has made it prominent in several [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tales. These include a story of a loon which created the world in a [[Chippewa]] story; a [[Mi'kmaq people|Micmac]] saga describes Kwee-moo, the loon who was a special messenger of Glooscap (Glu-skap), the tribal hero; native tribes of [[British Columbia]] believed that an excess of calls from this [[bird]] predicted [[rain]], and even brought it; and the tale of the loon's necklace was handed down in many versions among Pacific Coast peoples. Folk names include big loon, black-billed loon, call-up-a-storm, ember-goose, greenhead, guinea duck, imber diver, ring-necked loon, and walloon.

This bird is central to the plot of the novel ''[[Great Northern?]]'' by [[Arthur Ransome]] (in which it is referred to throughout as Great Northern Diver, with the obsolete scientific name ''Colymbus immer''). The story is set in the [[Outer Hebrides]], where the main characters<U+2014>a group of children on holiday<U+2014>notice a pair of loons apparently nesting there. Checking their bird book, they believe this to be the Great Northern Loon; however, this has not previously been seen to nest in northern Scotland, and so they ask for help from an ornithologist. He confirms that these birds are indeed the Great Northern; unfortunately, it soon transpires that he does not wish merely to observe, but wants to steal the eggs and add them to his collection; and to do this, he must first kill the birds. Published in 1947, the story is one where the conservationists are the eventual victors over the [[Egg collecting|egg collector]], at a time when the latter hobby was not widely considered to be harmful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allthingsransome.org/literary/totemgreatnorthern.html |title=Totem Animals in Swallows & Amazons: Great Northern? |first=Molly |last=McGinnis |month=February |year=2004 |work=[[All Things Ransome]] |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1567922597 |title=Great Northern?: A Scottish Adventure of Swallows & Amazons |first=Michael |last=Cornett |date=16 April 2008 |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=26 March 2010 }}</ref>
