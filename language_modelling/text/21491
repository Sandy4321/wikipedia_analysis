'''USS ''Iowa'' (BB-61)''' ("The Big Stick") was the [[lead ship]] of [[Iowa class battleship|her class]] of [[battleship]], and was the fourth ship of in the [[United States Navy]] to be named in honor of [[Iowa|the 29th state]].  ''Iowa'' is the only ship of the class to have served a combat tour in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] during [[World War II]].

During [[World War II]], ''Iowa'' served in Atlantic fleet as a countermeasure against the [[German Battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']]. When transferred to the Pacific fleet in 1944, ''Iowa'' shelled beachheads at [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] in advance of Allied amphibious landings and screened [[aircraft carrier]]s operating in the [[Marshall Islands]]. During the [[Korean War]], ''Iowa'' was involved in raids up and down the [[North Korea]]n coast, after which she was decommissioned into the [[United States Navy reserve fleets]], better known as the "mothball fleet". She was reactivated in 1984 as part of the [[600-ship Navy]] plan, and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets to counter the recently expanded [[Soviet Navy]]. In April 1989 [[USS Iowa turret explosion|an explosion of undetermined origin]] wrecked her #2 gun turret, killing 47 sailors.

''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time in 1990, and was initially struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 1995; however, she was reinstated in 1999 to allow her sister ship [[USS New Jersey (BB-62)|''New Jersey'']] to be donated to her namesake state for use as a museum. ''Iowa'' is currently berthed with the [[Suisun Bay]] [[United States Navy reserve fleets|reserve fleet]] near [[San Francisco, California]], and is awaiting donation to a not-for-profit entity for use as a [[museum ship]]. At present, ''Iowa'' is the only member of her class not open to the public.

== Construction ==
{{main|Iowa class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}
''Iowa'' was the lead ship of [[Iowa class battleship|her class]] of "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 August 1942, [[sponsor (military)|sponsored]] by [[Ilo Wallace]] (wife of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]]), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 22 February 1943 with Captain [[John L. McCrea]] in command.<ref name=Iowa-DANFS>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = Iowa | url = http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/battlesh/bb61.htm | short = on }}</ref> She was the first ship of her class of battleship to be commissioned by the United States.<ref name="Order">[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB61.htm ''Iowa''].

''Iowa''<U+2019>s main battery consisted of nine [[16 inch (406 mm)/50 caliber Mark 7 naval gun]]s, which could fire {{convert|2700|lb|kg}} armor-piercing shells some {{convert|24|nmi|km|0}}. Her secondary battery consisted of twenty [[5 inch (127 mm)/38 caliber gun]]s in twin turrets, which could fire at targets up to {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied [[aircraft carrier]]s; to this end, ''Iowa'' was fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40&nbsp;mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend Allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1984 ''Iowa'' had her remaining 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm Anti-Aircraft guns removed, and was outfitted with [[Phalanx CIWS]] mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and [[Armored Box Launcher]]s and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire [[Tomahawk missile]]s and [[Harpoon missile]]s, respectively.<ref name="The Battleships I">{{cite book  | last =Johnston | first = Ian | coauthors = McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 | date =2002 | location = London | pages =p. 120 | isbn = 0752261886 | oclc = 59495980 }}</ref>

== World War II (1943-1945) ==
=== Shakedown and service with the Atlantic Fleet ===

On 24 February 1943, ''Iowa'' put to sea for [[sea trial]] shakedown in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and along the Atlantic coast. She got underway on 27 August 1943 for [[Argentia|Argentia, Newfoundland]] to counter the threat of German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] which was reportedly operating in [[Norway|Norwegian]] waters before returning to the United States 25 October for two weeks of maintenance at the Norfolk Navy Yard.<ref name="Iowa I">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussiowa.org/general/html/detail.htm |title=USS IOWA(BB-61) Detailed History |accessdate=2008-08-09 |work=USS Iowa Veterans Association |publisher=The Veteran's Association of the USS IOWA (BB-61) |date= }}</ref>

After refueling and gathering her escorts, ''Iowa'' carried [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]], and other World War II military brass to [[Casablanca]], [[French Morocco]] on the first leg of the journey to the [[Tehran Conference]]. Among the vessels escorting ''Iowa'' on the journey was the [[Fletcher class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class destroyer]] {{USS|William D. Porter|DD-579}}. ''William D. Porter'' had already been involved in a major mishap when her anchor tore the railing and lifeboat mounts off of a docked sister destroyer while backing up the night before. The poor performance continued the next day when a [[depth charge]] from the deck of ''Porter'' fell into the rough sea and exploded, causing ''Iowa'' and the other escort ships to take [[Evasive Action|evasive maneuvers]] under the assumption that the task force had come under [[torpedo]] attack by a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[U-boat]].<ref name="Iowa II">{{cite web |url=http://www.ussiowa.org/general/html/willie_d.htm |title=The Ill-Fated USS William D.

On 14 November, at Roosevelt's request, ''Iowa'' conducted an anti-aircraft drill to demonstrate her ability to defend herself from enemy aircraft. The drill began with the release of a number of [[balloon]]s for use as AA-targets, most of which were shot by AA gunners aboard ''Iowa'', however a few of the balloons had drifted toward ''William D. Porter''. ''Porter'' went to battle stations and began shooting down the balloons ''Iowa'' had missed, and with the other escort ships demonstrated a torpedo drill by simulating a launch at ''Iowa''; however this drill abruptly turned serious when the #3 torpedo aboard ''William D. Porter'' discharged from its tube and headed toward ''Iowa''.<ref name="Iowa II"/>

''William D. Porter'' attempted to signal ''Iowa'' about the incoming torpedo, but owing to [[radio silence]] was forced to use a [[Signal lamp|blinker light]], and while relaying the message to ''Iowa'' the destroyer misidentified the direction of the torpedo and then relayed the wrong message.<ref>The incorrect message informed ''Iowa'' that ''William D. Porter'' was backing up rather than informing ''Iowa'' that a torpedo was in the water.</ref> In desperation the destroyer finally broke radio silence, and using [[codeword]]s, relayed a warning message to ''Iowa'' regarding the incoming torpedo. After confirming the identity of the destroyer, ''Iowa'' turned hard to avoid being hit by the torpedo. Roosevelt, meanwhile, had learned of the incoming torpedo threat and asked his [[secret service]] attendee to move his [[wheel chair]] to the side of the battleship.<ref name="Iowa II"/> Not long afterward the torpedo detonated in the wake of the battleship, however ''Iowa'' was unhurt, and after avoiding the accidental torpedo attack, ''Iowa'' trained her main guns on ''William D. Porter'' out of concern that the smaller ship may have been involved in some sort of [[assassination]] plot.<ref> This was later proved false, but as a result of this friendly fire incident, ships would routinely greet the destroyer with the hail "Don't shoot!  We're [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]]!" {{cite web |url=http://www.ussiowa.org/general/html/willie_d.htm |title=The Ill-Fated USS William D.

''Iowa'' would later complete her Presidential escort mission 16 December by returning the President to the United States.<ref name="Iowa II"/> Roosevelt addressed the crew of ''Iowa'' prior to leaving the battleship, at which time he said, "...from all I have seen and all I have heard, the ''Iowa'' is a 'happy ship,' and having served with the Navy for many years, I know<U+2014>and you know<U+2014>what that means." He also touched on the progress made at the conference before concluding his address with "...good luck, and remember that I am with you in spirit, each and every one of you," before leaving.<ref>{{cite speech | title = Remarks on Leaving the U.S.S.

=== Service with Battleship Division 7, Admiral Lee ===
[[Image:USS Iowa (BB-61) Preps.jpg|thumb|right|Backed up by {{USS|Indiana|BB-58}}, ''Iowa'' prepares to fire her main guns, possibly during the Marshall Islands Campaign.]]
As [[flagship]] of [[Battleship Division 7]], ''Iowa'' departed the United States 2 January 1944 for the Pacific Ocean, transiting the [[Panama Canal]] on 7 January in advance of her combat debut in the campaign for the [[Marshall Islands]]. From 29 January to 3 February, she supported carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral [[Frederick C. Sherman]]'s task group against [[Kwajalein]] and [[Eniwetok]] Atolls. Her next assignment was to support air strikes against the Japanese Naval base at [[Truk]], [[Caroline Islands]]. ''Iowa'', in company with other ships, was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti-shipping sweep around Truk, with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north. On 21 February, she was underway with the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] (TF&nbsp;58 or TF&nbsp;38, depending on whether it was part of [[U.S. 5th Fleet|the 5th Fleet]] or [[U.S. 3rd Fleet|the 3rd Fleet]]) while it conducted the first strikes against [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Guam]] in the [[Mariana Islands]]. During this action, ''Iowa'' sunk the Japanese light cruiser ''Katori''.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 18 March 1944, ''Iowa'', flying the flag of Vice Admiral [[Willis A. Lee]] ([[List of major U.S. Commands of World War II|Commander Battleships, Pacific]]), joined in the bombardment of [[Mili Atoll]] in the Marshall Islands. Although struck by two Japanese 4.7&nbsp;inch projectiles during the action, ''Iowa'' suffered negligible damage. She then rejoined Task Force 58 on 30 March, and supported air strikes against the [[Palau Islands]] and [[Woleai]] of the Carolines which continued for several days.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

From 22 April to 28 April 1944, ''Iowa'' supported air raids on [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] (now known as Jayapura), [[Aitape]], and [[Wakde]] Islands to support Army forces on Aitape, [[Tanahmerah Bay]], and [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]] in [[New Guinea]]. She then joined the Task Force's second strike on [[Truk]], on 29 April and 30 April, and bombarded Japanese facilities on [[Ponape]] in the Carolines on 1 May.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

In the opening phases of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]], ''Iowa'' protected the American carriers during air strikes on the islands of [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]], [[Guam]], [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and [[Pagan Island|Pagan]] on 12 June. ''Iowa'' was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13 June and 14 June, which resulted in the destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump. On 19 June, in an engagement known as the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], ''Iowa'', as part of the battle line of TF&nbsp;58, helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet. This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier-based air-forces, with ''Iowa'' claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft. ''Iowa'' then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy Fleet, shooting down one [[torpedo plane]] and assisting in splashing another.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/><ref name="Iowa I"/>

Throughout July, ''Iowa'' remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam. After a month's rest, ''Iowa'' sailed from Eniwetok as part of the [[US 3rd Fleet|Third Fleet]], and helped support the [[Battle of Peleliu|landings on Peleliu]] on 17 Septembe]. She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long awaited invasion of the [[Philippines]]. On 10 October, ''Iowa'' arrived off [[Okinawa]] for a series of air strikes on the [[Ryukyu Islands]] and [[Taiwan|Formosa]]. She then supported air strikes against [[Luzon]] on 18 October and continued this duty during General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s [[Battle of Leyte|landing on Leyte]] on 20 October.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

In a last-ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] struck back with Sh<U+014D>-G<U+014D> 1, a three-pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in [[Leyte Gulf]]. The planned called for Vice-Admiral [[Jisabur<U+014D> Ozawa]] to take the surviving Japanese carriers and use them as bait to draw US carriers of TF&nbsp;38 away from the Philippine beacheads, allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals [[Takeo Kurita]], [[Kiyohide Shima]], and [[Sh<U+014D>ji Nishimura]] to take surface task forces through the [[San Bernardino Strait]] and [[Surigao Strait]], where they would roundezvous and attack the US beacheads.<ref>Fuller, 1956</ref><ref>Morison, 1956</ref> ''Iowa'' accompanied TF&nbsp;38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the [[Sibuyan Sea]] toward San Bernardino Strait. The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral [[William Halsey|William "Bull" Halsey]] to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group; as a result, ''Iowa'', with TF&nbsp;38, steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off [[Cape Enga<U+00F1>o]], [[Luzon]]. On 25 October 1944, when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of ''Iowa'''s guns, word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carriers]] off [[Samar (island)|Samar]]. This threat to the American beachheads forced TF&nbsp;38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort-carrier fleet. However, the fierce resistance put up by the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th Fleet]] in the [[Battle off Samar]] had already caused the Japanese to retire and ''Iowa'' was denied a surface action. Following the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], ''Iowa'' remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa. She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

[[Image:USS Iowa 1945 LOC 182971pu.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Iowa'' in drydock in San Francisco, California, undergoing repairs and modernization after being damaged during Typhoon Cobra.]]
On 18 December 1944 the ships of Task Force 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when [[Typhoon Cobra]] overtook the force<U+2014>7 fleet carriers, 6 light carriers, 8 battleships, 15 cruisers, and about 50 destroyers<U+2014>during their attempt to refuel at sea.

On 18 December, the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel. Many of the vessels were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane force winds. Three destroyers, [[USS Hull (DD-350)|''Hull'' (DD-350)]], [[USS Monaghan (DD-354)|''Monaghan'' (DD-354)]], and [[USS Spence (DD-512)|''Spence'' (DD-512)]], capsized and sank with nearly all hands, while a cruiser, five aircraft carriers, and three destroyers suffered serious damage.<ref name="PT"/> Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed, with another 80 injured.

=== Bombardment of Japan ===
[[Image:USS Missouri transfers.JPG|thumb|right|{{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}} transfers personel to ''Iowa'' in advance of the surrender cermony planned for 2 September]]
''Iowa'' sailed on 19 March 1945 for Okinawa, arriving on 15 April and relieving her sister ship {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62}}. Beginning 24 April, the ''Iowa'' supported carrier operations which aimed to establish and maintain air superiority for ground forces during their struggle for the island. She then supported air strikes off southern [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] from 25 May to 13 June 1945. ''Iowa'' then sailed toward northern Honshu and Hokkaido, and participated in strikes on the Japanese home-islands on 14 July and 15 July by bombarding [[Muroran, Hokkaid<U+014D>|Muroran]], [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]], destroying steel mills and other targets.  The city of [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hitachi]] on [[Honsh<U+016B>]] was shelled beginning the night of 17 July and lasting to 18 July. On 29 and 30 July, ''Iowa'' trained her guns on [[Kahoolawe]] for a bombardment. ''Iowa'' continued to support fast carrier strikes until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August as a result of the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. On 27 August, ''Iowa'' and her sister ship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63}} entered [[Sagami Bay]] to oversee the surrender of the [[Yokosuka naval district]].<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/><ref name="Iowa I"/>

''Iowa'' entered [[Tokyo Bay]] with the occupation forces on 29 August 1945. While in the bay she received a number of sailors from sister ship ''Missouri'' who were temporarily transferred to ''Iowa'' for the duration of the surrender ceremony aboard ''Missouri''.<ref name=Missouri-DANFS>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = Missouri | url = http://history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm | short = on }}</ref> After serving as Admiral Halsey's flagship for the surrender ceremony on 2 September 1945, ''Iowa'' remained in the bay as part of the occupying force. As part of the ongoing [[Operation Magic Carpet]], she received homeward bound GIs and liberated US [[POW]]s before departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September, bound for the United States.<ref name="Iowa I"/><ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

== Post World War II (1945-1949) ==
''Iowa'' arrived in [[Seattle, Washington]], 15 October 1945, then sailed for [[Long Beach]], where it engaged in training operations until returning to Japan in 1946 to serve as flagship for the [[US 5th Fleet]]. ''Iowa'' returned to the United States on 25 March 1946 and resumed its role as a training ship. During this time she also embarked Naval Reserve elements and [[midshipmen]] for training in addition to her usual training routine of drills and maneuvers. In October, the ''Iowa'' underwent a period of overhaul and modernization, which resulted in the addition of the SK-2 Radar and the loss of a number of 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm gun mounts. In July, following the [[Bikini atomic experiments]], the battleship {{USS|Nevada|BB-36}} was selected for use as a target for a [[live fire exercise]] in which ''Iowa'' and other sea and air assessts of the navy were to sink the battleship. The exercise began with a shelling by a destroyer, heavy cruiser, and ''Iowa'', and concluded with one aerial torpedo; this caused the ''Nevada'' to sink aproximetely 65 miles from [[Pearl Harbor]] 31 July 1948.<ref>[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB36.htm ''Nevada''].

== The Korean War (1951-1952) ==
In 1950, [[North Korea]] [[Korean War|invaded]] South Korea, prompting NATO members, including the United States, to intervene in the name of the [[United Nations]]. President [[Harry S. Truman]] was caught off guard when the invasion struck,<ref>American Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] had told Congress on 20 June that no war was likely.</ref> but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan to transfer to South Korea. Truman also sent U.S. based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to the area to support South Korea. As part of the naval mobilization, ''Iowa'' was reactivated 14 July 1951, and formally recommissioned on 25 August, with Captain William R. Smedberg III in command. ''Iowa'' sailed for Korean waters in March 1952, and on 1 April relieved her sister ship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64}} and became the flagship of [[Vice admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]] [[Robert Briscoe]], Commander of the [[US 7th Fleet]].<ref name="Iowa I"/>
In her first combat operation of the Korean War, ''Iowa'' fired her main guns near [[Wonson-Songjin]] on 8 April 1952, with the goal of striking North Korean supply lines. In the company of other naval vessels ''Iowa'' again engaged North-Korean forces the following day, this time against enemy troop concentrations, supply areas, and suspected gun positions in and around [[Suwon Dan]] and [[Kojo]]. In Support of the South Korea's [[I Corps (South Korea)|I Corps]], the ''Iowa'' shelled enemy positions on 13 April, killing 100 enemy soldiers, destroying six gun emplacements, and wrecking a division headquarters. The next day she entered [[Wonson]] harbor and shelled warehouses, observation posts and railroad marshaling yards before moving out to rejoin the UN flotilla aiding ground forces around [[Kosong]]. On 20 April, in her first combat action above the [[38th parallel]], ''Iowa'' shelled railroad lines at [[Tanchon]], where four [[railroad]] [[tunnel]]s were destroyed, before sailing to [[Chindong]] and [[Kosong]] for a two day bombardment of North-Korean positions.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 25 May ''Iowa'', following her sister ship ''Missouri''<U+2019>s example, arrived in the waters off [[Chongjin]], a North Korean industrial center about 48&nbsp;miles from the Russian border. Upon arrival, the ''Iowa'' proceeded to shell the industrial and rail transportation centers in Chongjin, after which she moved south to aid the [[X Corps (United States)|U.S. X Corps]]. En-route to U.S. positions, the ''Iowa'' again bombarded Songjin, destroying several railroad tunnels and bridges in the area.  On 28 May 1952, the ''Iowa'' rejoined the main body of the U.S. fleet supporting the X Corps, heavily shelling several islands in Wonsan Harbor.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

Throughout June, ''Iowa'' trained her guns on targets at [[Mayang-do]], Tanchon, Chongjin, [[Chodo-Sokto]] and ports of [[Hungnam]] and Wonsan in support of the UN and South Korean Forces. On 9 June, a helicopter from ''Iowa'' rescued a downed pilot from the carrier {{USS|Princeton|CV-37}}.<ref name="Iowa I"/> At the time, ''Princeton'' was operating with TF 77, and with other carriers in the task force were involved in a bombing campaign against North Korean supply lines, troop concentrations, and infrastructure; additionally, the carriers were flying close air support missions for ground forces fighting against the North Korean forces.<ref>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = Princeton | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/p12/princeton-v.htm | short = on }}</ref> In July ''Iowa'' received a new skipper, Captain Joshua W. Cooper, who assumed command of the battleship for the remainder of her Korean War tour.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 20 August, ''Iowa'' took aboard nine wounded men from the destroyer {{USS|Thompson|DD-627}} after ''Thompson'' was hit by a Chinese artillery battery while shelling enemy positions at S<U+014F>ngjin.  At the time ''Iowa'' was operating 16 miles (30 km) south of S<U+014F>ngjin, and after receiving the wonded destroyermen ''Iowa'' covered ''Thompson'' as she retreated into safer waters.<ref>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = Thompson | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t5/thompson-ii.htm | short = on }}</ref><ref name="Iowa I"/>

[[Image:USSIowa.jpg|thumb|right|''Iowa'' fires her guns off the coast of Koje 17 October 1952]]
On 23 September, [[General]] [[Mark Wayne Clark]], the Commander-In-Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea, came aboard ''Iowa''. During his time aboard the battleship Clark observed ''Iowa'' in action as her guns shelled Wonsan area for a third time, accounting for the destruction of a major enemy [[ammunition dump]]. On 25 September, ''Iowa'' fired her guns at an enemy railroad and thirty-car [[train]].<ref name="Iowa I"/>

In October, ''Iowa'' was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy, a [[feint]] to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships big guns. On 16 October, during the operation, ''Iowa'' provided anti-aircraft support to {{USS|Mount McKinley|AGC-7}}, an amphibious force command ship.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

=== Post Korean War (1953-1957) ===

''Iowa'' embarked midshipmen for at sea training to Northern Europe in July 1953, and shortly afterwards took part in Operation "Mariner," a major NATO exercise, serving as flagship of Vice Admiral [[Edmund T. Wooldridge]], commanding the [[U.S. 2nd Fleet|Second Fleet]]. Upon completion of this exercise, until the fall of 1954, ''Iowa'' operated in the [[Virginia Capes]] area. In September 1954, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Libby, Commander, Battleship Cruiser Force, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|United States Atlantic Fleet]].<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

From January to April 1955, ''Iowa'' made an extended cruise to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as the flagship of the Commander, [[U.S. 6th Fleet|Sixth Fleet]]. ''Iowa'' departed on a midshipman training cruise 1 June 1955 and upon her return, she entered Norfolk for a four-month overhaul. Following the overhaul, ''Iowa'' continued intermittent training cruises and operational exercises, until 4 January 1957 when she departed Norfolk for duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Upon completion of this deployment, ''Iowa'' embarked midshipmen for a South American training cruise and joined in the [[International Naval Review]] off [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]], on 13 June 1957.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

On 3 September 1957, ''Iowa'' sailed for Scotland for NATO [[Operation Strikeback]]. She returned to Norfolk on 28 September 1957, and departed Hampton Roads for the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] on 22 October 1957. She was decommissioned 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/>

== Reactivation (1982-1984) ==
[[Image:Iowa Modernization.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Iowa'' in drydock undergoing modernization]]
As part of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]<U+2019>s and  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[John F. Lehman]]<U+2019>s effort to create an expanded [[600-ship Navy]], ''Iowa'' was reactivated and moved under tow to [[Avondale Shipyards]] near [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] for refitting and equipment modernization in advance of her planned recommissioning.<ref name="Iowa-DANFS"/> During the refit, ''Iowa'' had all of her remaining [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40&nbsp;mm]] anti-aircraft guns removed, due to their ineffectiveness against modern [[Fighter aircraft|jet fighters]] and anti-ship missiles.  Additionally, the two 5&nbsp;inch gun mounts located at mid-ship and in the [[aft]] on the [[Port (nautical)|port]] and [[starboard]] side of the battleship were removed.<ref name="FAS Iowa">{{cite web | title = BB-61 IOWA-class | format = specifications | url = http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/bb-61.htm | publisher = [[Federation of American Scientists]] | date = [[2000-10-21]] | accessdate=2006-11-26 }}</ref>

The ''Iowa'' was then towed to [[Ingalls shipbuilding]], [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]],<ref name="Iowa I"/> where over the next several months the battleship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available.  Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK&nbsp;141 quad cell launchers for 16&nbsp;[[Harpoon missile|AGM-84 Harpoon]] anti-ship missiles, eight [[Armored Box Launcher|Armored Box Launcher (ABL)]] mounts for 32&nbsp;[[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] [[missile]]s, and a quartet of [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx]] [[Close-in weapon system|Close In Weapon System (CIWS)]] [[gatling gun]]s for defense against enemy [[anti-ship missile]]s and enemy aircraft.<ref name="FAS Iowa"/> ''Iowa'' was the first battleship to receive the [[RQ-2 Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]], a remotely controlled drone that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16&nbsp;in/50&nbsp;Mark&nbsp;7&nbsp;guns,<ref name="Drone">{{cite web | title = The Warfighter's Encyclopedia: Aircraft&nbsp;<U+2014> RQ-2 Pioneer | url = https://wrc.navair-rdte.navy.mil/warfighter_enc/aircraft/UAVs/pioneer.htm}}</ref><ref name="fas drone">{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/pioneer.htm |title=Pioneer Short Range (SR) UAV |accessdate=2007-03-02 |last=Pike |first=John |date=2000-03-05 |publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}</ref> and ''Iowa'' could carry up to eight of the UAVs at a time.<ref name="FAQ">{{cite web|title = USS Missouri (BB-63) Frequently Asked Questions |work= USS Missouri (BB-63) Frequently Asked Questions | url = http://www.factplace.com/mightymo.htm#Ship FactPlace.com |publisher= Ben M.

Gneckow.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

=== Shakedown and NATO exercises (1984-1989) ===
[[Image:Uss iowa bb-61 pr.jpg|thumb|right|''Iowa'' fires a full broadside of nine 16&nbsp;in / 50-caliber and six 5&nbsp;in / 38-caliber guns during a target exercise near [[Vieques Island]], [[Puerto Rico]], 1 July 1984]]
From April to August 1984, ''Iowa'' underwent refresher training and naval gunfire support qualifications in the Atlantic Ocean, then spent the rest of 1984 on a shakedown cruise in the area around [[Central America]]. During this cruise she aided in several humanitarian operations, such as those conducted in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Honduras]]<ref name="Iowa I"/><ref>All Hands, October 1985, pg 40</ref> before returning to the United States in April 1985 for a period of routine maintenance.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

In August 1985, ''Iowa'' joined 160 other ships for Exercise Ocean Safari, a NATO naval exercise aimed at testing NATO's ability to control sea lanes and thereby maintain free passage of shipping. Owing to bad weather, ''Iowa'' and the other ships were forced to ride out rough seas, but ''Iowa'' made use of the rough seas to practice hiding herself from enemy forces. While serving with the exercising force ''Iowa'' crossed the [[Arctic Circle]].<ref>All Hands, January 1986, pg.20</ref> In October, ''Iowa'' took part in Baltic Operations, and fired her phalanx guns, 5&nbsp;guns, and 16&nbsp;guns in the [[Baltic Sea]] on 17 October while operating with U.S. and other allied ships.<ref>All Hands, May 1986, pg 30</ref> After the conclusion of the Baltic operations ''Iowa'' returned to the United States.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

In 1986 ''Iowa'' returned to the waters around Central America, conducting drills and exercises while providing a military presence to friendly nations. On 4 July 1986, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]] boarded ''Iowa'' for the [[International Naval Review]], which was held in the [[Hudson River]].<ref>All Hands, September 1986</ref> That same month Larry Seaquist assumed command of the battleship and her crew.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 17 August, ''Iowa'' set sail for the North Atlantic and in September participated in Exercise Northern Wedding by ferrying [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] ashore and assisting helicopter gunships. During the exercise ''Iowa'' fired her main guns at [[Cape Wrath]] range in Scotland in support of a simulated [[amphibious assault]] 5 and 6 September, firing a total of nineteen 16&nbsp;in shells and thirty-two 5&nbsp;in shells during a ten hour period. As with Exercise Ocean Safari, ''Iowa'' operated in rough seas and adverse weather conditions. During the live fire exercise a small number of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] assigned to ''Iowa'' were put ashore to monitor the fall of shot and advise the battleship of gunnery corrections.<ref>All Hands, January 1987</ref> At the conclusion of the exercise ''Iowa'' visited ports in England and Germany before returning to the United States in October.

[[Image:Iowa drone.jpg|thumb|left|Crewmen recover an RQ-2 Pioneer [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] aboard ''Iowa''.]]
In December ''Iowa'' became the testbed for the Navy's [[RQ-2 Pioneer]] [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]] (UAV). The drone was designed to serve as an aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for a airplanes or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard ''Iowa''.<ref name="fas drone">{{cite web | last = Pike | first = John  | title = Pioneer Short Range (SR) UAV | url = http://www.fas.org/irp/program/collect/pioneer.htm | publisher = Federation of American Scientists | date = 2000-03-05 | accessdate = 2007-03-02 }}</ref>

From January to September 1987 ''Iowa'' operated in the waters in and around Central America and participated in several exercises until sailing for the [[Mediterranean Sea]] 10 September to join the [[US 6th Fleet]] based there. She remained in the Mediterranean Sea until 22 October, when she was detached from the sixth fleet and departed for operations in the North Sea. On 25 November, as part of [[Operation Earnest Will]], ''Iowa'' transitioned the [[Suez Canal]] and set sail for the [[Persian Gulf]], which at the time was one of the battlefields of the [[Iran-Iraq War]].<ref name="Iowa I"/> The presence of U.S. Naval vessels in the gulf was in response to a formal petition from Kuwait, whose ships were being attacked by Iranian forces.<ref><U+201C>Kuwaiti Call for Help Led to U.S. Role in Gulf,<U+201D> Los Angeles Times, 4 July 1988.</ref> ''Iowa'' and other vessels operating in the gulf were assigned the job of escorting Kuwaiti tankers from Kuwaiti ports to the open sea, but because U.S. law forbade military escorts for civilian ships flying a foreign flag the tankers escorted by the United States were reflagged as U.S. merchant vessels and assigned American names.<ref name=kelley-0706>{{citation|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf|title=Better Lucky Than Good: Operation Earnest Will as Gunboat Diplomacy|author=Stephen Andrew Kelley|date=June 2007|publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]]|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref> For the remainder of the year ''Iowa'' escorted [[Kuwait]]i gas and oil tankers "reflagged" as U.S. merchant ships from the Persian Gulf through the [[Straits of Hormuz]].<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 20 February 1988 ''Iowa'' departed from the Persian Gulf, transited the Suez Canal, and set sail for the United States, arriving at Norfolk 10 March for routine maintenance. In April she participated in the annual Fleet Week celebrations before returning to Norfolk for an overhaul. In May, Fred Mosally replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of the ''Iowa''. In August, ''Iowa'' set sail on sea trails, then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

On 20 January 1989, during gunnery practice off [[Vieques Island]], ''Iowa'' fired a 16&nbsp;in shell 23.4 [[nautical mile]]s, setting a record for the longest 16&nbsp;in shell ever fired. In February the battleship sailed for [[New Orleans]] for a port visit before departing for Norfolk. On 10 April the battleship was visited by commander of the [[US 2nd Fleet]], and on 13 April sailed to participate in fleet exercise.<ref name="Iowa I"/>

With the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining battleships as part of the active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, ''Iowa'' was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990. ''Iowa'' was the first of the reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and was decommissioned earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged #2 turret. ''Iowa'', as part of the [[National Defense Reserve Fleet]], was berthed at the [[Naval Education and Training Center]] in Newport, from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey, under tow, to [[California]]. The ship arrived in [[Suisun Bay]] near [[San Francisco]] on 21 April 2001 and is part of the [[Reserve Fleet]] there, where she remained in reserve until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in January 1995.<ref name="FAS Iowa"/>

Section 1011 of the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the ''Iowa''-class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets (or "mothball fleet"). The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps' amphibious operations.<ref name="NDAA1996">{{cite web |url=http://www.nist.gov/director/ocla/Public_Laws/PL104-106.pdf |format=pdf |title=National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996(Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=2005-05-26 |date=[[1996-02-10]] |page=422}}</ref> Due to ''Iowa''<U+2019>s damaged turret #2, the Navy selected ''New Jersey'' for placement into the mothball fleet, even though the training mechanisms on ''New Jersey'''s 16&nbsp;in guns had been welded down. The cost to fix ''New Jersey'' was considered less than the cost to fix ''Iowa'';<ref name="FAS Iowa"/> as a result, ''New Jersey'' and ''Wisconsin'' were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet.<ref name="NDAA1996"/>

''New Jersey'' remained in the mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through the [[United States Congress]] 18 October 1998. Section 1011 required the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] to list and maintain ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' on the Naval Vessel Register, while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike ''New Jersey'' from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not-for-profit entity in accordance with section 7306 of [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10, United States Code]]. Section 1012 also required the transferee to locate the battleship in the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/1999NDAA.pdf |format=pdf |title=Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 (Subtitle B-Naval Vessels and Shipyards) |accessdate=2007-03-12 |publisher=105th Congress, United States Senate and House of Representatives |pages=pp. 200<U+2013>201}}</ref> The Navy made the switch in January 1999, allowing ''New Jersey'' to open as a museum ship in her namesake state.<ref name="showboat">{{cite web |url=http://www.battleshipnewjersey.org/history/milestone_dates.php |title=Battleship New Jersey |publisher=Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial|accessdate=2005-05-26}}</ref>

For several years plans had been under way to berth the ''Iowa'' in [[San Francisco, California]], opening the battleship there as a museum; however, in 2005, San Francisco<U+2019>s city council, citing opposition to the [[Iraq War]] and the military's policies regarding [[homosexual]]s, voted 8-3 against maintaining ''Iowa'' in the city, paving the way for other California communities to bid for the battleship. [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]], site of the former [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] and [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] are competing for the vessel. The Historic Ships Memorial at Pacific Square (HSMPS) organization that attempted to place the ship in San Francisco is now working with the Mare Island, Vallejo, site. Both communities have identified berthing piers and have submitted proposals to the Department of the Navy to open the vessel to tourists and educational groups as a memorial and museum.

On 17 March 2006 the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] exercised his authority to strike ''Iowa'' and ''Wisconsin'' from the NVR, which has cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as [[museum ship|museums]]; however, the [[United States Congress]] remains "deeply concerned" over the loss of naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and has noted that "...navy efforts to improve upon, much less replace, this capability have been highly problematic."<ref name="Congress 193">109th Congress, House of Representatives. Report 109<U+2013>452. [http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf National Defense Authorization Act of 2007]. Page 193. Accessed 26 November 2006.</ref> Partially as a consequence, the [[US House of Representatives]] has asked that the battleships be kept in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again.<ref name="Congress 68">109th Congress, House of Representatives. Report 109<U+2013>452. [http://armedservices.house.gov/NDAA2007CommiteeReport.pdf National Defense Authorization Act of 2007]. Page 68. Accessed 26 November 2006</ref> Congress has asked that the following measures be implemented to ensure that, if need be, ''Iowa'' can be returned to active duty:
#''Iowa'' must not be altered in any way that would impair her military utility;
#The battleship must be preserved in her present condition through the continued use of cathodic protection, dehumidification systems, and any other preservation methods as needed;
#Spare parts and unique equipment such as the {{convert|16|in|mm|0|sing=on}} gun barrels and projectiles be preserved in adequate numbers to support ''Iowa'', if reactivated;
#The Navy must prepare plans for the rapid reactivation of ''Iowa'' should she be returned to the Navy in the event of a national emergency.<ref name="Congress 68"/>
These four conditions closely mirror the original three conditions that the Nation Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of ''Iowa'' while she was in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|Mothball Fleet]].<ref name="FAS Iowa"/><ref name="Congress 104">104th Congress, House of Representatives. [http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/olc/docs/1996NDAA.pdf National Defense Authorization Act of 1996]. Page 237. Accessed 17 December 2006.</ref> It is unlikely that these conditions will impede the current plan to turn ''Iowa'' into a permanent museum ship.

''Iowa'' earned nine [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service and two for [[Korean War]] service.<ref>All Hands, December 1985, pg 45</ref>
