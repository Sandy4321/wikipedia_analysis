'''<U+00C6>thelhard''' (also '''Ethelhard''', '''<U+00C6>thilheard''',<ref name=ODS181>Farmer ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'' p. 181</ref> or '''Aethelheard'''; died 12 May 805) was a [[Bishop of Winchester]] then an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in medieval England. Appointed by King [[Offa of Mercia]], <U+00C6>thelhard had difficulties with both the [[List of monarchs of Kent|Kentish monarchs]] and with a [[Bishop of Lichfield|rival archiepiscopate]] in southern England, and was deposed around 796 by King [[Eadberht III Pr<U+00E6>n]] of Kent. By 803, <U+00C6>thelhard, along with the Mercian King [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]], had secured the demotion of the rival archbishopric, once more making Canterbury the only archbishopric south of the [[Humber]] in Britain. <U+00C6>thelhard died in 805, and was considered a saint until his cult was suppressed after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in 1066.

==Early life==

Nothing is known of <U+00C6>thelhard's family background or early life, however it is assumed that he was a native of [[Mercia]]. He first appears in the historical record as [[abbot]] of a monastery at [[Louth, Lincolnshire]] before being named to the [[diocese of Winchester]].<ref name=DNB>Williams "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8910 <U+00C6>thelheard (d. 805)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.<ref name=HBC223>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 223</ref>

==Canterbury==

<U+00C6>thelhard was translated from the [[see of Winchester]] to the [[see of Canterbury]] in 792 and was enthroned as archbishop on 21 July 793.<ref name=HBC214>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 214</ref> <U+00C6>thelhard owed his appointment to King Offa of Mercia,<ref name=DNB/> and the enthronement was presided over by the then-senior bishop of the land: [[Hygberht]], the [[Archbishop of Lichfield]]. King Offa consulted [[Alcuin of York]] over proper procedure, as the archbishopric of Lichfield was a new creation.<ref name=ASE225>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 225</ref> 

Around 796, <U+00C6>thelhard was deposed by King Eadberht III Pr<U+00E6>n of Kent because <U+00C6>thelhard had been appointed by Offa. Offa had died in 796, and Eadberht seized control of Kent, forcing <U+00C6>thelhard to flee to the court of Offa's son [[Ecgfrith of Mercia]]. Ecgfrith himself died before 796, and a distant relative Coenwulf took the throne. Alcuin encouraged <U+00C6>thelhard to return to Canterbury, and suggested a compromise over the status of Lichfield, which had been established by Offa in rivalry to Canterbury. Alcuin's plan would have allowed Hygberht to retain archiepiscopal status during his lifetime, but it would be a purely ceremonial rank. In this proposal, Canterbury would regain its status as the only archbishopric south of the Humber and <U+00C6>thelhard would return to Canterbury. However,  <U+00C6>thelhard was unable to do this while Eadberht was still in power.<ref name=Brooks120>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 120<U+2013>132</ref> Alcuin had previously stated that Lichfield had been elevated because of a "lust for power", presumably by Offa, and not through any consideration of the merits of the plan.<ref name=Kirby142>Kirby  ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 142</ref>

Although Alcuin had scorn for <U+00C6>thelhard for fleeing Canterbury, the papacy saw it differently. Pope [[Pope Leo III|Leo III]] praised <U+00C6>thelhard for fleeing and refusing to submit to Eadberht, whom Leo compared to the later Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. There are indications, though, that the Kentish community considered electing another archbishop while <U+00C6>thelhard was in exile.<ref name=Kirby149>Kirby  ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 149</ref>

==Troubles with Lichfield==

Because Lichfield had been established by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent.<ref name=Brooks120/> Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor [[Pope Adrian I|Hadrian I]], who had approved the elevation of Lichfield.<ref name=Kirby143>Kirby  ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 143</ref> Coenwulf's embassy bore a letter to the pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of  Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]]'s old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf was asking for <U+00C6>thelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from <U+00C6>thelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorized his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping <U+00C6>thelhard from Canterbury.<ref name=Brooks120/> 

In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and captured Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. <U+00C6>thelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He also managed to secure professions of obedience from a number of southern bishops, including [[Eadwulf of Lindsey]] and [[Tidfrith of Dunwich|Tidferth]] of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in disputes in Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions could be made on the dispute.<ref name=Brooks120/>

<U+00C6>thelhard resolved to go to Rome and consult with the pope about the decline in power of the see of Canterbury.<ref name=ASE225>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 225<U+2013>227</ref> The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop [[Cyneberht of Winchester|Cyneberht]] of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope.<ref name=Brooks120/> After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric.<ref name=DNB/> Besides these papal actions, there are indications that the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognized the elevation of Lichfield.<ref name=Kirby142/>

==Return from exile==

<U+00C6>thelhard returned to England in 803, and convened the [[Councils of Clovesho|Council of Clovesho]], which decreed that no archiepiscopal see besides Canterbury should ever been established in the southern part of Britain. Hygberht attended the council, but as an abbot, which makes it apparent that he had resigned his see before the council met.<ref name=Brooks120/> At that same council, <U+00C6>thelhard also presented a papal decision that asserted the freedom of churches from secular authority.<ref name=Hindley106>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 106</ref> While at the council, <U+00C6>thelhard once more proclaimed that the papacy had been deceived into elevating Lichfield, and that it was a "tyranical power" that had been behind the effort.<ref name=Kirby142/> <U+00C6>thelhard presided over at least eleven synods, and possibly one more.<ref name=DNB/>

<U+00C6>thelhard died on 12 May 805 and was buried in [[Canterbury]].<ref name=DNB/> He was later revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 May, but his cult was suppressed by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] in the late 11th century and never was revived.<ref name=ODS181/>
