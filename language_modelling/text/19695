'''Nightjars''' are medium-sized [[nocturnal]] [[bird]]s with long wings, short legs and very short bills that usually nest on the ground. Nightjars are sometimes referred to as '''goatsuckers''' from the mistaken belief that they suck milk from goats (the [[Latin]] for goatsucker is ''Caprimulgus''). Some [[North America]]n species are named as '''nighthawks'''. 

Nightjars are found around the world. They are mostly active in the late evening and early morning or at night, and feed predominantly on moths and other large flying insects. 

Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is cryptically coloured to resemble bark or leaves. Some species, unusually for birds, perch along a branch, rather than across it. This helps to conceal them during the day.

The [[Common Poorwill]],  ''Phalaenoptilus nuttallii'' is unique as a bird that undergoes a form of hibernation, becoming torpid and with a much reduced body temperature for weeks or months.

Nightjars lay one or two patterned eggs directly onto bare ground.

==Systematics==
Traditionally, nightjars have been divided into two subfamilies: the [[Caprimulginae]], or typical nightjars with about 70 species, and the [[Chordeilinae]], or [[nighthawk]]s of the New World with about 9 species. The two groups are similar in most respects, but the typical nightjars have rictal bristles, longer bills, and softer plumage.  In their pioneering [[DNA-DNA hybridisation]] work, [[Charles Sibley|Sibley]] and Ahlquist found that the genetic difference between the eared-nightjars and the typical nightjars was, in fact, greater than that between the typical nightjars and the nighthawks of the New World. Accordingly, they placed the eared-nightjars in a separate [[Family (biology)|family]]: [[Eurostopodidae]]. 

Subsequent work, both morphological and genetic, has provided support for the separation of the typical and the eared-nightjars, and some authorities have adopted this Sibley-Ahlquist recommendation, and also the more far-reaching one to group all the [[owl]]s (traditionally Strigiformes) together in the [[Caprimulgiformes]]. The listing below retains a more orthodox arrangement, but recognises the eared-nightjars as a separate group. For more detail and an alternative classification scheme, see [[Caprimulgiformes]] and [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]].
