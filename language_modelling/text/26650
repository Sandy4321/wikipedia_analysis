'''Brendan Morrison''' (born August 15, 1975, in [[Pitt Meadows, British Columbia|Pitt Meadows]], [[British Columbia]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] for the [[Dallas Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  Former teams include the [[Anaheim Ducks]], the [[Vancouver Canucks]], who he has played the majority of his career for, and the [[New Jersey Devils]], who had originally drafted him in [[1993 NHL Entry Draft|1993]].  During his [[college hockey]] career, he received the [[Hobey Baker Award]] with the [[Michigan Wolverines]].

==Playing career==
===Early career===
After a 94-point season in the [[British Columbia Hockey League|British Columbia Junior Hockey League]] (BCJHL), Morrison was drafted by the [[New Jersey Devils]] 39th overall in the 2nd round of the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]].  Upon being drafted, he played four successful seasons of [[college hockey]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines]] of the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]] (CCHA).  He was named the CCHA Rookie of the Year in 1994<ref name=college/> after a 48-point freshman year in 38 games.  He then received his first of three CCHA First Team All-Star selections following his sophomore year in 1995.<ref name=college/> The following year, he received the first of back-to-back CCHA CCHA Player of the Year honours,<ref name=college>{{citeweb|title=Brendan Morrison Career Statistics (under: Career notes)|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=PlayerDetail&playerId=8459461|publisher=[[National Hockey League|NHL]]|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> while leading Michigan to the 1996 NCAA Championship.  He also received the tournament MVP award.<ref name=college/>  In his senior year, he totalled 31 goals, 57 assists and 88 points in 43 games, culminating in a [[Hobey Baker Award]], awarded annually to the best [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] ice hockey player. 

In [[1997-98 NHL season|1997-98]], Morrison began his professional career, playing mostly for the [[Albany River Rats]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). He finished the season with 84 points <U+2013> ninth overall in league scoring and second among rookies.  He was edged out by [[Daniel Bri<U+00E8>re]], who recorded 92 points, for [[Dudley "Red" Garrett Memorial Award|Rookie of the Year]] honours, but was named to the AHL All-Rookie Team.<ref name=college/>  That same season, he made his NHL debut with the Devils.  He was called up and played in his first NHL game on December 4, 1997, <U+2013> a 4-0 win against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] <U+2013> and scored his first NHL goal against [[Tom Barasso]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Devils Shut Down Penguins|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DB103DF936A35751C1A961958260|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=1997-12-05}}</ref>  He finished the season with 9 points in 11 games.  The following year, he landed a full-time spot on the Devils' roster and came fifth in [[Calder Memorial Trophy]] voting, with one first-place vote.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Smith, Cheryl M. |title=FaceOff 2000 NHL Yearbook |origyear=1999 |publisher=Worldsport Properties, Inc. |location=Toronto |pages=238 }}</ref> Morrison played in New Jersey until March 14, 2000, when he was traded to the [[Vancouver Canucks]] along with [[Denis Pederson]] in exchange for [[Alexander Mogilny]].

===Vancouver Canucks===
In Vancouver, Morrison established himself as the team's first line centre, joining [[Todd Bertuzzi]] and [[Markus N<U+00E4>slund]] to complete what was arguably the league's most effective line combination.<ref>{{citeweb|last=Johnson|first=George|title=Naslund driving towards 50 -- and the Hart |url=http://static.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/johnson_george/1530723.html|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref>  As a result, Morrison's most productive seasons occurred in [[2001-02 NHL season|2001-02]] and the [[2002-03 NHL season|2002-03]], when he scored 67 and 71 points respectively. Morrison's linemates, Bertuzzi and N<U+00E4>slund both finished among the league's top five scoring in the same two seasons.

The following season, Morrison finished the regular season with 60 points as the Canucks entered the [[2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs]] as the third seed.  Perhaps Morrison's greatest play as a Canuck occurred in the sixth game of the opening round against the [[Calgary Flames]].  A little less than three minutes into the third [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime period]], Morrison emerged from the corner boards, skated the puck around Calgary goalie [[Miika Kiprusoff]], and scored to stave off elimination.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Vancouver vs. Calgary|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores104/104108/20040417NHL--CALGARY---0.htm|date=2004-04-17|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref>  However, despite Morrison's game six heroics, the Canucks were defeated in overtime in game seven.

In lieu of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]], Morrison represented [[Link<U+00F6>pings HC]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Elitserien]].  He competed against N<U+00E4>slund, as well as other teammates [[Daniel Sedin|Daniel]] and [[Henrik Sedin]], who played for [[Modo Hockey|Modo]].  Before NHL play resumed the next season, Morrison re-signed with the Canucks at $9.6 million over three more seasons.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks re-sign Brendan Morrison|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/08/05/morrison050804.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=2008-08-05}}</ref>

Going into the [[2007-08 NHL season|2007-08 season]], Morrison had played five consecutive seasons without missing a game.  After [[Colorado Avalanche|Colorado]] defenceman [[Karlis Skrastins]] was forced to miss a game with a knee injury on February 25, 2007, Morrison became the NHL's reigning ironman.  Skrastins streak ended at 495 games, while Morrison, at the time, had played in his 492nd.<ref>{{citeweb|title=NHL: AVALANCHE: Skrastins' Record Streak Ends At 495|url=http://www.noticias.info/archivo/2007/200702/20070226/20070226_263993.shtm|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=2007-02-26|publisher=NoticiasB2B}}</ref>  On December 12, 2007, the ironman streak was snapped at 542 games when he decided not to play a game due to wrist complications.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=''[[Vancouver Sun]]''|title=Canucks lose ironman Morrison to injury|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=09e6ac59-cfeb-4bc5-a843-fb8b1561488a&k=58467|last=MacIntyre|first=Iain|date=[[2007-12-12]]|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>  The streak, which had begun on February 27, 2000, with the Devils, was the eleventh longest in NHL history.<ref name=ironman>{{citeweb|title=Ankle injury stops Fleury|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/122/story/827481.html|publisher=The News and Observer Publishing Company|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=2007-12-13}}</ref> He was succeeded by [[Calgary Flames|Calgary]]'s [[Cory Sarich]], who was at 419 consecutive games when Morrison went down.<ref name=ironman/>  Out of Morrison's overall ironman streak, 534 were played as a Canuck, which is currently the franchise record for consective games played.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}  After first succumbing to the streak-ending wrist injury, Morrison was re-injured, [[ACL injury|tearing his ACL]].  He completed the season with 25 points in 39 games, then underwent surgery on April 7, 2008.<ref name=oc>{{citeweb|title=New Duck Morrison feeling good and heading to Newport Beach|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/morrison-ducks-selanne-2136945-season-thought|publisher=OC Register|accessdate=2008-09-02|date=2008-08-26}}</ref>

===Anaheim Ducks and Dallas Stars===
Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Morrison signed with the [[Anaheim Ducks]] on July 7.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Brendan Morrison cuts deal with Ducks:report|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/07/08/ducks-morrison.html?ref=rss|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=2008-07-07}}</ref>  He left the Canucks ninth overall in [[Vancouver Canucks#Franchise scoring leaders|all-time franchise scoring]] with 394 points in 543 games.  About a month into the [[2008<U+2013>09 NHL season|2008<U+2013>09 season]], Morrison scored his first goal as a Duck on November 7, 2008, in a 5<U+2013>2 loss to the [[Dallas Stars]].<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Niedermayer, Ducks seeing stars|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/08/sports/sp-elliott8?s=g&n=n&m=Broad&rd=news.google.ca&tnid=1&sessid=562995e214fce93d6a99c6b75ef150df7e1b9310&pgtp=article&eagi=&page_type=article&exci=2008_11_08_sports_sp-elliott8&pg=1|accessdate=2009-03-18|date=2008-11-08|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}</ref>  Morrison's tenure with the Ducks, however, was short-lived.  Thought to be still recovering from off-season surgery, he managed just 22 points in his 62-game stint with the club.  Initially intended to replace the departed [[Andy McDonald]] as the second-line centre, he had been relegated to the fourth line<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Ducks waive Morrison as trade deadline nears|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/03/ducks-waive-mor.html|accessdate=2009-03-03|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}</ref> and made a healthy scratch during the season for the first time since [[1999<U+2013>00 NHL season|1999<U+2013>00]], while he was still with the Devils.<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Benching doesn't sit well with Morrison|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/24/sports/sp-ducksfyi24|accessdate=2009-03-18|date=2008-11-24|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''}}</ref>  Morrison was placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Dallas Stars]] on March 4, 2009.<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Stars claim Brendan Morrison|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/03/04/sp-morrison.html|accessdate=2009-03-04|date=2009-03-04|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]}}</ref>  He scored his first goal with the Stars in his fourth game since being picked up on March 12, 2009, in a 3<U+2013>2 win against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].<ref>{{Citeweb|title=Steve Begin, Brendan Morrison score first goals for Dallas; Stars beat Hurricanes 3-2|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/wild/41186547.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUBP7hUiacyKUUr|accessdate=2009-03-18|date=2009-03-12|publisher=''[[Star Tribune]]''}}</ref>

Morrison has competed for [[Canadian national men's hockey team|Team Canada]] in three [[World Ice Hockey Championships|World Championships]].  The first of which, in [[2000 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2000]], he recorded 1 goal and 3 assists as Canada finished fourth, losing the bronze medal game to [[Finland national men's ice hockey team|Finland]].  Four years later, Morrison was joined by [[Vancouver Canucks|Canucks]]' teammate [[Matt Cooke]], as Canada captured gold at the [[2004 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2004 World Championships]] in the [[Czech Republic]].  Morrison contributed 1 goal and 6 assists in 9 games.  

The next year, Morrison played in the [[2005 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2005 World Championships]], in which all NHL players were eligible to participate.  On account of the [[2004-05 NHL lockout]], the playoffs did not interfere with the World Championships, as it otherwise would.  Reaching the gold medal game for the second consecutive year, Canada was, however, shutout by the [[Czech Republic national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]].  Morrison contributed 4 goals in 9 games.

Shortly thereafter, on August 14, 2005, Morrison was invited to Team Canada's Olympic Orientation Camp, a selection process for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin, Italy]].  He was a late addition, replacing [[Mario Lemieux]], who had pulled out at the last minute.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Some big-name players will not make squad (under: Morrison, the punch line)|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?id=2138449|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-07-07|date=2005-08-22|last=Burnside|first=Scott}}</ref>  However, Morrison did not make the final roster.

==Personal life==
While playing with [[Vancouver Canucks|Vancouver]], Morrison resided year-round in a home in [[Coquitlam, British Columbia|Coquitlam]], [[British Columbia]].  He is married to his wife, Erin, has one son, Brayden, and three daughters  Makenna, Kailyn, and Taylor.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Brendan Morrison with Brayden, Makenna and Kailyn|url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/features/fathers/story.html?id=f205c12b-d49a-470b-8628-bd39ce0f8206&k=57335|accessdate=2008-09-08|date=2007-06-14|publisher=[[The Province]]}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Brendan Morrison's Anaheim Ducks Profile|url=http://ducks.nhl.com/team/app?page=PlayerDetail&playerId=8459461&service=page&tab=bio|accessdate=2008-11-08|publisher=[[Anaheim Ducks]]}}</ref> After signing with the Ducks, he made his new residence in [[Newport Beach, California|Newport Beach]], [[California]].<ref name=oc/>

Morrison is the brother-in-law of [[Dallas Stars]] color commentator [[Daryl Reaugh]]. Accordingly, Brendan will be rooming at the Reaugh residence for the remainder of the 2008-09 season.{{fact|date=March 2009}}
