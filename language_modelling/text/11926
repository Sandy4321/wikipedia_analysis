The '''Eurocopter EC155''' is a long-range medium-lift passenger transport [[helicopter]] developed by [[Eurocopter]] from the [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]] family for civil aviation use. It is a twin-engined aircraft and can carry up to 13 passengers along with 1 or 2 crew, depending on customer configuration. The helicopter is marketed for passenger transport, offshore support, [[Very Important Person|VIP]] corporate transport and casualty transport duties.

==Development==

Originally designated AS365 N4, the EC155 was developed from the [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Eurocopter AS365 N3 Dauphin 2]] with the aim of significantly increasing the cabin space of the Dauphin. Development began in September 1996 with the helicopter officially announced by Eurocopter at the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1997. The first EC155 helicopter, a modified [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]] airframe, made its maiden flight at [[Marignane]] on 17 June 1997 and the first pre-production EC155 B flew on 11 March 1998. The aircraft received safety certification by the French & [[Luftfahrt-Bundesamt|German]] Civil Aviation Authorities on 11 December 1998 and went into production soon after, with a price tag of US$7<U+2013>8 million depending on installed equipment. Deliveries of the EC155 B began in March 1999, with the [[German Federal Police]] becoming the first operator.

The EC155 B1 was developed with more powerful engines and has improved performance at high altitude and in hot temperature conditions. This derivative also features a higher maximum take-off weight (10,846&nbsp;lb vs. 10,580&nbsp;lb). Deliveries of this model began in November 2002 with the [[Government Flying Service (Hong Kong)|Hong Kong Government Flying Service]] becoming the first operator.

==Design==
The EC155 B features a completely redesigned cabin providing 30% more passenger space than previous [[Eurocopter Dauphin|Dauphin]] helicopter models, plus a 130% increase in baggage hold volume. Other major improvements include a five-blade Spheriflex [[Composite material|composite]] main rotor combined with the familiar shrouded [[Fenestron]] [[tail rotor]] to reduce vibration levels significantly. The EC155 B is powered by two 635&nbsp;kW (851 shp) [[Turbomeca]] [[Turbom<U+00E9>ca Arriel|Arriel 2C1]] [[turboshaft]] engines mounted over the luggage hold, which feature a dual-channel [[FADEC|Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC)]] system. The EC155 B1 features uprated 697&nbsp;kW (935 shp) Arriel 2C2s. The helicopter can be fitted with an [[Deicing|anti-icing]] system to enable the aircraft to operate in very cold climates. The [[Glass cockpit|all-glass cockpit]] is equipped with an 'Avionique Nouvelle' integrated digital flight control system featuring Eurocopter's Vehicle and Engine Management Display (VEMD), which utilizes [[Active-matrix liquid crystal display|active matrix liquid crystal displays]]. The EC155 is also equipped with a four-axis digital autopilot, coupled to the engine FADECs for full-envelope protection, and is offered with a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS).<ref>Gray 2000, pp. 48-49.</ref>

Eurocopter designed the EC155 originally with three configurations, however, another two configurations were added in 2005. The Passenger Transport version can carry 12 passengers in comfort seats or 13 passengers in utility seats, along with 1 or 2 crew. The [[Very Important Person|VIP]] or Corporate Transport version has a VIP lounge with working space accommodating up to 8 executives. The Casualty Transport version can carry 2 stretchered patients with up to 4 seated medical staff, or 4 patients on stretchers plus 2 seated medical staff. The configurations added in 2005 were for Offshore operation and Police & Parapublic missions ranging from patrol, airborne surveillance, [[Search and rescue|SAR]] and [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], the helicopter being fitted with specific mission equipment for these duties.<ref name ="gray 48">Gray 2000, p. 48.</ref>
