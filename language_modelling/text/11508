'''Tuolumne County''' ({{pronEng|tu<U+02D0><U+02C8><U+0252>l<U+0259>mi}} "To All o' Me", with a silent N) is a [[county (USA)|county]] located in the  [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].  The northern half of [[Yosemite National Park]] is located in the eastern part of the county.  As of 2000 the population was 54,501.  The [[county seat]] is [[Sonora, California|Sonora]], the county's only incorporated city.

==History==
Tuolumne County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood.  Prior to statehood, it had been referred to as Oro County.  Parts of the county were given to [[Stanislaus County, California|Stanislaus County]] in 1854 and to [[Alpine County, California|Alpine County]] in 1864.

The name ''Tuolumne'' is of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] origin and has been given different meanings, such as Many Stone Houses, The Land of Mountain Lions and, Straight Up Steep, the latter an interpretation of [[William Fuller]], a native Chief. [[Mariano Vallejo]], in his report to the first [[California State Legislature]], said that the word is "a corruption of the Indian word ''talmalamne'' which signifies 'cluster of stone wigwams.'" The name may mean "people who dwell in stone houses," i.e., in caves.
