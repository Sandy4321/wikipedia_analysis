'''Her Majesty's Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]], located on [[the Haymarket]], in the [[City of Westminster]].  The current building was designed by [[Charles J. Phipps]] and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who established the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] at the theatre.  In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of [[Shakespeare]] and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premi<U+00E8>res by major playwrights such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[J. M. Synge]], [[Noel Coward]] and [[J. B. Priestley]].  Since [[World War I]], the wide flat stage has made the theatre particularly suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has specialised in hosting [[musical theatre|musicals]].  The house has been home to a number of record-setting runs in musical theatre history, notably the [[World War I]] sensation ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''<ref>Larkin, Colin (ed). ''Guinness Who's Who of Stage Musicals'' (Guinness Publishing, 1994) ISBN 0-85112-756-8</ref> and the current production, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]<U+2019>s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.

The theatre was established by architect and playwright [[John Vanbrugh]], in 1705, as the '''Queen's Theatre'''. Legally, serious [[drama]] unaccompanied by music was forbidden in all but the two London [[patent theatre]]s, and so this theatre quickly became an [[opera house]].  Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 [[George Frederick Handel]] operas premi<U+00E8>red here.<ref>[http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm ''Handel's Compositions''] GFHandel.org, accessed [[21 December]] [[2007]]</ref>  In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], in 1847, and presented the first London performances of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'', ''[[Cos<U+00EC> fan tutte]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.<ref>Einstein, Alfred.  ''Mozart: His Character, His Work'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 1945)</ref>  It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premi<U+00E8>res of such famous operas as [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' and [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]''. 

The name of the theatre changes with the gender of the monarch.  It first became the '''King's Theatre''' in 1714 on the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]].  Most recently, the theatre was known as '''His Majesty's Theatre''' from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of [[Elizabeth II]].  The theatre's current capacity is 1,216&nbsp;seats, and the building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in January 1970.  [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Group Theatres]] has owned the theatre since 2000.

==History==
[[Image:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Vanbrugh]] painted by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]
The end of the 17th century was a period of intense rivalry amongst London's actors, and in 1695 there was a split in the [[United Company]], who had a monopoly on the performance of drama at their two theatres.  Dramatist and architect [[John Vanbrugh]] saw this as an opportunity to break the duopoly of the [[patent theatre]]s, and in 1703 he acquired a former stable yard, at a cost of <U+00A3>2000, for the construction of a new theatre on the Haymarket.  In the new business, he hoped to improve the share of profits that would go to playwrights and actors. He raised the money by subscription, probably amongst members of the [[Kit-Cat Club]]:
<blockquote><p>To recover them [that is, [[Thomas Betterton]]'s company], therefore, to their due Estimation, a new Project was form'd of building them a stately Theatre in the Hay-Market, by Sir John Vanbrugh, for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality, at one hundred Pounds each, in Consideration whereof every Subscriber, for his own Life, was to be admitted to whatever Entertainments should be publickly perform'd there, without farther Payment for his Entrance.</p><p><U+2014>John Vanbrugh's notice of subscription for the new theatre<ref name=Brit>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40570 ''The Haymarket Opera House'', Survey of London: volumes 29 and 30: St James Westminster, Part 1 (1960), pp. 223<U+2013>50], accessed [[18 December]] [[2007]]</ref></p></blockquote> He was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager [[William Congreve]] and an actors' co-operative led by [[Thomas Betterton]].<ref name=Downes>Downes, Kerry.  ''Sir John Vanbrugh: A Biography'' (London: Sidgwick and Jackson 1987) ISBN 0-283-99497-5</ref> 

The theatre provided the first alternative to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], built in 1663 and the [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincoln's Inn]], founded in 1660 (forerunner of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], built in 1728).  The theatre's site is the second oldest such site in London that remains in use.  These three post-[[English Interregnum|interregnum]] theatres defined the shape and use of modern theatres.<ref name=Guide>Earl, John and Michael Sell.  ''Guide to British Theatres 1750-1950'', p. 117 (Theatres Trust, 2000) ISBN 0-7136-5688-3.  [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] was founded as a music room in 1683, and a theatre was built on the site in 1765.</ref>  

===Vanbrugh's theatre: 1705<U+2013>1789===
The land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740 and was ultimately owned, as it is today, by the [[Crown Estate]].  Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage, and a three bay entrance led to a brick shell {{convert|130|ft|m|1}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m|1}} wide.  [[Colley Cibber]] described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor.<ref name=Brit/>  

Vanbrugh and Congreve received [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s authority to form ''a Company of Comedians'' on [[14 December]] [[1704]], and the theatre opened as The Queen's Theatre on [[9 April]] [[1705]] with imported Italian singers in ''The Loves of Ergasto'', an opera by Giacomo Greber, with an epilogue by Congreve.  The opera failed and the season struggled on through May, with revivals of plays and operas.<ref name=Lloyd>[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/HerMajestysTheatre.htm ''Her Majesty's Theatre''] Arthur Lloyd, accessed [[17 December]] [[2007]]</ref>  The first new play performed was ''The Conquest of Spain'' by [[Mary Pix]].<ref>Williamson, Marilyn L. ''Raising Their Voices: British Women Writers, 1650-1750'', pp. 109<U+2013>10 (Wayne State University Press, 1990) ISBN 081432147X</ref> The theatre proved too large for actors' voices to carry across the auditorium, and the first season was a failure.  Congreve departed, Vanbrugh bought out his other partners, and the actors reopened the Lincoln's Inn Fields' theatre in the summer.  Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music, a taste was growing amongst the nobility for [[Italian opera]], which was completely sung, and the theatre became devoted to opera.  As he became progressively more involved in the construction of [[Blenheim Palace]], Vanbrugh's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement".<ref>Milhous, Judith.  ''Thomas Betterton and the Management of Lincoln's Inn Fields 1695<U+2014>1708'' (Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1979) ISBN 0809309068</ref>  On [[7 May]] [[1707]], experiencing mounting losses and running costs, Vanbrugh was forced to sell a lease on the theatre for fourteen years to Owen Swiney at a considerable loss.  In December of that year, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] ordered that "all Operas and other Musicall presentments be performed for the future only at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Hay Market"<ref name=Brit/> and forbade the performance of further non-musical plays there.<ref name=Brit/>

After 1709, the theatre was devoted to Italian opera and was sometimes known informally as The Haymarket Opera House.<ref name=Victoria>[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Allingham, Philip V.

This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage.  The work was well received,<ref>[http://www.aam.co.uk/features/9901.htm Hicks, Anthony.

John James Heidegger took over the management of the theatre and, from 1719, began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre.<ref name=Brit/>  A "Royal Academy of Music" was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors, including the [[Prince Regent]], to support Handel's productions at the theatre.<ref>Gibson, Elizabeth.

There were a first and second Royal Academy of Music, directed by Handel, each formed for a limited period <U+2013> hence the need for two.  From 1734 it became known as the ''Opera of the Nobility''.  These organisations are not related to the modern [[Royal Academy of Music]] founded by [[John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]] in 1822.</ref> Handel was also a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734, and he contributed to incidental music for theatre, including for a revival of [[Ben Johnson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', opening on [[14 January]] [[1710]].<ref>''Handel: A Documentary Biography'', [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] (Black, 1955) ISBN 0306706245</ref> 

On the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714, the theatre was renamed the King's Theatre and remained so named during a succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne.  At this time only the two [[patent theatre]]s were permitted to perform serious drama in London, and lacking [[Letters patent]], the theatre remained associated with opera.<ref>[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/renaissance/restoration_patent.php ''Royal Patents'' (The Theatre Museum).] [[Victoria and Albert museum]], PeoplePlayUK, accessed [[11 February]] [[2008]]</ref> In 1762, [[Johann Christian Bach]] travelled to London to premi<U+00E8>re three operas at the theatre, including ''Orione'' on [[19 February]] [[1763]].

[[Image:Richard Sheridan.jpg|thumb|Actor-manager [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], painted by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]
In 1778, the lease for the theatre was transferred from James Brook to Thomas Harris, stage manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and to the playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] for <U+00A3>22,000. They paid for the remodelling of the interior by [[Robert Adam]] in the same year. In November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' reported that Harris and Sheridan had <blockquote><p>... at a considerable expence<!--sic-->, almost entirely new built the audience part of the house, and made a great variety of alterations, part of which are calculated for the rendering the theatre more light, elegant, and pleasant, and part for the ease and convenience of the company.  The sides of the frontispiece are decorated with two figures painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], which are remarkably picturesque and beautiful; the heavy columns which gave the house so gloomy an aspect that it rather resembled a large mausoleum or a place for funeral dirges, than a theatre, are removed.</p><p><U+2014>November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]''<ref name=Brit/></p></blockquote>   
The expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts, and the partnership dissolved, with Sheridan buying out his partner with a mortgage on the theatre of <U+00A3>12,000 obtained from the banker [[Henry Hoare]].<ref name=Brit/>

One member of the company, Giovanni Andrea Battista Gallini, had made his d<U+00E9>but at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed.  He now purchased the mortgage.  Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer.  The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre, and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781.  In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski, formerly a scene painter at the theatre.  In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, in the interests of the creditors.  Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager.  In 1788, the [[Lord Chancellor]] observed "that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [the interested parties] seemed to apply for relief".<ref name=Brit/>  Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated.<ref name=Brit/> Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. ''The World'' described a performance as follows: "... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly."<ref name=Sanquine>Bondeson, Jan. ''The London Monster: A Sanguinary Tale'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000) ISBN 0812235762</ref> At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.<ref name=Sanquine/>

The theatre burnt down on [[17 June]] [[1789]] during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage.  The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of <U+00A3>300 for capture of the culprit.<ref name=Brit/>  With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre]], and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in [[Leicester Square|Leicester Fields]] for a new building, which too would require a licence.  The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other.  The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the [[Oxford Street]] [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]].  This too, would burn to the ground in 1792.  Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly.  A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter.  The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.<ref name=Brit/>  

By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct connection with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in [[Greenwich]].  After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.<ref name=Brit/>

===Second theatre: 1791<U+2013>1867===
[[Image:Opera House Haymarket edited.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior of second theatre on the site, c. 1808. Drawing by [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]] for ''Ackermann's Microcosm of London'']]
Taylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791.  Michael Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site, but the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as <blockquote>... fronted by a stone basement in rustic work, with the commencement of a very superb building of the Doric order, consisting of three pillars, two windows, an entablature, pediment, and balustrade. This, if it had been continued, would have contributed considerably to the splendour of London; but the unlucky fragment is fated to stand as a foil to the vile and absurd edifice of brick pieced to it, which I have not patience to describe.<p><U+2014>The critic Malcolm, quoted in ''Old and New London'' (1878)<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45193 "The Haymarket".] ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 216<U+2013>26, accessed [[18 December]] [[2007]]</ref></p></blockquote>

The Lord Chamberlain, a supporter of O'Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor.  The theatre opened on [[26 March]] [[1791]] with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but was not allowed to open to the public.  The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision.  As a later manager of the theatre wrote, "In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread."<ref name=Brit/>  Meetings were held at [[Carlton House]] and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties.  On [[24 August]] [[1792]] a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties.  The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], who would then appoint a general manager.  Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King's Theatre and the Pantheon.  The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.<ref name=Brit/>

The first public performance of opera in the new theatre took place on [[26 January]] [[1793]], the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled.  This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became the home of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791&ndash;94.<ref>Milhous Judith, Dideriksen, Gabriella and Hume, Robert D.

From 1793, seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room.  It was in this room that [[Joseph Haydn]] gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of [[Johann Peter Salomon]], on his second visit to London in 1794<U+2013>95.<ref name=Brit/><ref>On Haydn's previous visit, the concerts had been presented at the Hanover Square Rooms with tremendous success.

With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'' in 1806, ''[[Cos<U+00EC> fan tutte]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberfl<U+00F6>te]]'' in 1811, and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and George Repton made alterations to the fa<U+00E7>ade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2,500.

====Pierre Fran<U+00E7>ois Laporte====
In 1828, Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre Fran<U+00E7>ois Laporte, who held the position (with a brief gap in 1831<U+2013>33) until his death in 1841.  Two of Rossini's Paris operas (''[[Le comte Ory]]'' and ''[[Le si<U+00E8>ge de Corinthe]]'') had their British premi<U+00E8>res at the theatre during this period, and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]] (''[[La sonnambula]], [[Norma]]'' and ''[[I puritani]]'') and [[Gaetano Donizetti]] (''[[Anna Bolena]], [[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and ''[[Lucrezia Borgia]]'') to the British public.  Under Laporte, singers such as [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Pauline Garcia-Viardot]], [[Giovanni Battista Rubini]], [[Luigi Lablache]] and [[Mario (tenor)|Mario]] made their London stage debuts at the theatre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sadie|first=Stanley (ed)|year=1992|title=The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]| publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|pages = vol 2, p. 1101|id=ISBN 978-0-19-522186-2}}</ref>  Among the musical directors of this period was [[Nicolas Bochsa]], the celebrated and eccentric French harpist.

From the early 1830s until the late 1840s, Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the [[romantic ballet]], in which the ballet company, known as the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre, was the most renowned troupe in Europe aside from the [[Paris Opera Ballet|ballet of the Paris Opera]].  The great balletmaster [[Jules Perrot]] began staging ballet at the theatre in 1830.  He was named ''Ma<U+00EE>tre de Ballet'' (First Balletmaster/Chief Choreographer) to the theatre in 1842.  Among the works of ballet that he staged were ''[[Ondine (ballet)|Ondine]]'' (1843), ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (1844), and ''[[Catarina or La Fille du Bandit|Catarina]]'' (1846), as well as the popular [[divertissement]] ''[[Pas de Quatre]]'' (1845).  Other balletmasters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of [[Filippo Taglioni]]), who staged ballets including ''Coralia or The Inconstant Knight'' (1847) and ''Electra'' (1849 <U+2013> the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting).  [[Arthur Saint-L<U+00E9>on]] staged such works as ''[[La Vivandi<U+00E8>re]]'' (1844), ''Le Violin du Diable'' (1849), and ''Stella'' (1850).<ref name=Edgecombe>Edgecombe, Rodney Stenning. "Cesare Pugni, Marius Petipa, and 19th Century Ballet Music." ''[[Musical Times]]'', Summer 2006.</ref>

The Italian composer [[Cesare Pugni]], was appointed Her Majesty's Official Composer of Ballet Music from 1843 until 1850, and he composed the bulk of the ballets presented at the theatre.<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/italiandance/web4.html ''500 Years of Italian Dance''.] [[New York Public Library]], accessed [[18 February]] [[2008]]</ref>  Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre, having composed more than 100 original ballets and contributed to nearly 200, as well as composing numerous divertissements and incidental dances.  Throughout the era of the romantic ballet, the theatre presented performances by notable [[ballerina]]s, including [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Lucile Grahn]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]], performing in the works of Perrot, Taglioni, Pugni and Saint-Leon.<ref name=Edgecombe/>

Over the course of the 1840s, [[Dion Boucicault]] had five plays produced here: ''The Bastile'' [sic], an "after-piece" (1842), ''Old Heads and Young Hearts'' (1844), ''The School for Scheming'' (1847), ''Confidence'' (1848), and ''The Knight Arva'' (1848).  In 1853, [[Robert Browning]]'s ''Colombe's Birthday'' played at the theatre.<ref name=Victoria/>  

In 1841, disputes arose over Laporte's decision to replace the [[baritone]] [[Antonio Tamburini]] with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and the performers formed a 'revolutionary conspiracy'.

====Benjamin Lumley====
[[Image:Image-Jenny Lind Lithograph 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jenny Lind]], ''The Swedish Nightingale'', 1850]]
Laporte died suddenly, and [[Benjamin Lumley]] took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' and ''[[La fille du r<U+00E9>giment]]''. Initially, relations between Lumley and [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good.  [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[Nabucco]]'' and ''[[I Lombardi]]'' received their British premi<U+00E8>res in 1845-46, and Lumley commissioned ''[[I masnadieri]]'' from the composer.  This opera received its world premi<U+00E8>re on [[22 July]], [[1847]], with the Swedish operatic diva [[Jenny Lind]] in the role of Amalia, and the British premi<U+00E8>res of two more Verdi operas, ''[[I due Foscari]]'' and ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'', followed in 1847<U+2013>48.<ref name=Viking2>{{cite book |last = Holden |first = Amanda |coauthors = (editor), with Kenyon, Nicholas and Walsh, Stephen |title = The Viking Opera Guide |origyear = 1993 |publisher = Viking |location = London |id = ISBN 0-670-81292-7 |page = pp. 1126<U+2013>43}}</ref>  Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its current title, Her Majesty's Theatre.<ref>[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/AbouttheHouse/Index.cfm?ccs=288&cs=1017&SubNavMenu=7&login=0 ''Discover the History of the Royal Opera House''.] Royal Opera House, accessed [[18 December]] [[2007]]</ref>  

Lumley engaged [[Michael William Balfe|Michael Balfe]] to lead the orchestra<ref>Walsh, Basil. [http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/balfe/bio1.html ''Michael W. Balfe (1808-70): His Life and Career''.] Victorian Web, accessed [[7 February]] [[2008]]</ref> and entered negotiations with [[Felix Mendelssohn]] for a new opera.  Jenny Lind had made her English d<U+00E9>but on [[4 May]] [[1847]] in the role of Alice in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]'', in the presence of the Royal family and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]].  Such was the press of people around the theatre that many "arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn, and coats hanging in shreds, having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle".<ref name=Headland/>  She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the ''Swedish Nightingale''.<ref name=Headland>Headland, Helen ''The Swedish Nightingale: A Biography of Jenny Lind'' (Kessinger Publishing, 2005) ISBN 1419155385</ref>  The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival.<ref name=Brit/>  After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premi<U+00E8>res of Verdi operas: ''[[La traviata]]'' in 1856 and ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' in 1858.<ref name=Viking2/>

====J. H. Mapleson====
[[Image:Her Majesty's Theatre in 1867.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The theatre burns down in 1867]]
From 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by [[James Henry Mapleson]], presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premi<U+00E8>res of ''[[La forza del destino]]'', ''[[M<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>e (Cherubini)|M<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>e]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor (opera)|The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, [[Ema Puk<U+0161>ec|De Murska]], [[Therese Tietjens]], [[Antonio Giuglini]], [[Charles Santley]] and [[Christine Nilsson]].<ref name=Maple>Mapleson, J. H. ''The Mapleson Memoirs'', ed. H. Rosenthal, (London, 1966)</ref>  On the night of [[6 December]] [[1867]], the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove.  Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity.  The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage.  With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].<ref name=Maple/>

By the 1850s, with the era of the romantic ballet at an end, the principal personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-L<U+00E9>on, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar's]] [[Imperial Ballet]] of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]].  Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century.  Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as [[Adeline Gen<U+00E9>e]] began performing.<ref>[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/dance_tour/ballet/romantic_intro.php ''Romantic Ballet''.] PeoplePlayUK, accessed [[18 December]] [[2007]]</ref>  The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the [[Old Vic|Vic Theatre]] and soon took on the name of the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]].  Later, relocating primarily to the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet.  Eventually the troupe began performing at the [[Royal Opera House]] and became the [[Royal Ballet, London|Royal Ballet]], as it is known today.<ref>[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/ballet/index.cfm?ccs=473 ''History of The Royal Ballet''.] Royal Opera House, accessed [[11 February]] [[2008]]</ref>

===Third theatre: 1868<U+2013>1896===
[[Image:Carl Rosa 1.png|thumb|right|[[Carl Rosa]]'s opera company performed at the third theatre.]]
A third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of <U+00A3>50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for [[William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]].  It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain.  They had taken over [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s practice on his retirement.  The new theatre used materials such as concrete and ironwork to reduce the future risk of fire.  The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars.  For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500.  As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9900E0DD173BEF34BC4952DFB766838F669FDE&oref=slogin "English Gossip".] ''[[New York Times]]'', [[23 December]] [[1873]], accessed [[31 January]] [[2008]]</ref> and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a [[Revivalism|Revivalist Christian]] group for <U+00A3>31,000.<ref name=Brit/> 

Mapleson returned to Her Majesty's in 1877 and 1878, after a disastrous attempt to build a 2,000-seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of [[Scotland Yard]].  On the return of the company, all the fittings of the theatre had been removed, including the seats, carpets and even the wallpaper.  <U+00A3>6,000 was spent on fitting out the theatre, and on [[28 April]] [[1877]] the building returned to theatrical use with the opening of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.  The London premi<U+00E8>re of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' occurred here on [[22 June]] [[1878]], and in subsequent seasons the theatre hosted the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] (Rosa's wife, [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], had made her name in opera partly at Her Majesty's) and a programme of French plays and [[light opera]].  In 1882, the theatre hosted the London premi<U+00E8>res of [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring cycle]]''.<ref name=Lloyd/>

Mapleson returned in 1887 and 1889, but ''[[The Times]]'' commented that the repertoire comprised "works that had long ceased to attract a large public, the singers were exclusively of second-rate quality, and the standard of performance was extremely low".<ref name=Brit/> ''[[Rigoletto]]'', on [[25 May]] [[1889]], was the last operatic performance given in the house.<ref name=Brit/>

==Phipps' theatre: 1897<U+2013>present==
With the rapid advances in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still held by the Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891.  The ''Commissioners of Woods and Forests'' (for the Crown Estate) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892.  Plans were commissioned from architect [[Charles J. Phipps]] for a theatre and a hotel.  In February 1896 an agreement was reached with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] for the erection of the theatre at a cost of <U+00A3>55,000.  The plans were approved in February 1897, and on [[16 July]] [[1896]], the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid.<ref name=Brit/>  Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.<ref name=EH>{{IoEentry|210129|Her Majesty's Theatre}} Images of England, accessed [[28 April]] [[2007]]</ref>

===Architecture===
[[Image:her.majestys.theatre.london.arp.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Her Majesty<U+2019>s Theatre in 2005]]
The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House.<ref>The Carlton Hotel, opened in 1899 by the chef [[Auguste Escoffier]] and hotelier [[C<U+00E9>sar Ritz]] after they left the [[Savoy Hotel]], introduced the ''[[<U+00E0> la carte]] menu''.</ref>  The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays.  The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor.  The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the [[French Renaissance]].  The theatre has a [[Corinthian Order|Corinthian]] colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer.  This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances.<ref name=EH/>  The theatre lies on an east<U+2013>west axis.  The stage at the western end was {{convert|49|ft|m|1}} deep and {{convert|69.5|ft|m|1}} wide,<ref name=Brit/> and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked.<ref name=Guide/>  The interior was designed by the consulting architect, William Henry Romaine Walker (1854<U+2013>1940), after the Opera at [[Versailles]] by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Gabriel]].  Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above.  In all, there were 1,319&nbsp;seats.  Contemporary opinion was critical of the project.  Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, "The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building."<ref>Sachs, Edwin O. ''Modern Opera Houses and Theatres'' vol. ii, p. 36 (London, 1897) (Reprint Ayer Co Pub., 1968) ISBN 0405089066</ref>

Modern opinion of the theatre is more generous, with [[English Heritage]] describing the building as both Phipps' finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London.  The building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] in January 1970.<ref name=EH/>  Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new embassy for [[New Zealand]], completed in 1963 by British architects [[Robert Matthew]], Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the [[Commonwealth Institute]].  In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture.<ref>[http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/newzealand.html New Zealand House, Haymarket.] The 20th century Society, accessed [[31 January]] [[2008]]</ref>  The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Renton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.<ref>Jones, Edward, and Christopher Woodward.

The current theatre opened on [[28 April]] [[1897]].  Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the [[Haymarket Theatre]],<ref>Herbert Beerbohm Tree obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', [[3 July]] [[1917]], p. 11</ref> and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917.  For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome.<ref name=EH/>  This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years.  The theatre opened with a dramatisation of [[Gilbert Parker]]'s ''The Seats of the Mighty''.  Adaptations of novels by [[Dickens]], [[Tolstoy]], and others formed a significant part of the repertoire, along with classical works from [[Moli<U+00E8>re]] and [[Shakespeare]].  The theatre also hosted the world premi<U+00E8>re of [[J. M. Synge]]'s ''[[The Tinker's Wedding]]'' on [[11 November]] [[1909]]<ref>Synge, J. M. ''The Complete Plays'' (1st.

Tree defended himself from critical censure, demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death.<ref>Hoenselaars, A. J.

In 1904, Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art (later [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art|RADA]]), which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in [[Bloomsbury]].  Tree continued to take graduates of the Academy into his company at His Majesty's, employing some 40 actors in this way by 1911.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rada.org/history.html |title=RADA History |accessdate=2008-01-06 |work=Royal Academy of Dramatic Art}}</ref>
