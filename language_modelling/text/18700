Athletic teams are referred to as the "Mean Green."  This name is usually associated with football star and 1969 graduate [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean" Joe Greene]], a legendary member of the famous [[Steel Curtain]] defense of the 1970s [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]; however, accounts vary about the actual origins of "Mean Green".<ref>[http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/w04/mean.htm University of North Texas North Texan Online Fall 2004: Mean Green video memories<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the spring of 2002, the school's chapter of the Albino Squirrel Preservation Society attempted to make the group's namesake the school's secondary mascot.

[[Image:UNT Eagle statue.jpg|right|thumbnail|"In High Places" is a prominent representation of the eagle on campus.]]
* The [http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/pics/bell.jpg'''Spirit Bell'''] is a 2,000-pound bell brought in from Michigan in 1891 to signal class changes and curfew. Members of the Talons spirit group later began running it up and down the field at football games; it was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack. A 1,600-pound Spirit Bell is currently in use at games.
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Unt_tower_green.jpg'''McConnell Tower'''], the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building in the center of campus, is bathed in green light for each victory by a UNT athletic team. It appears on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the One O'Clock Lab Band) and 7:00 (the 1892 curfew time for Texas Normal College and Teacher Training Institute students).
* The [http://web2.unt.edu/dos/new/images/cst/handSign.jpg'''eagle talon'''] hand gesture is made by curling the thumb, index and middle fingers forward, leaving the ring finger and pinky closed against the palm.
* A [http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/rush/bonfire/burning.jpg'''Bonfire'''] is built with thousands of pallets donated by [[Miller Brewing]] of Denton and the local [[Peterbilt]] plant. The pallets are stacked in a 40-foot by 40-foot footprint then stacked to a final height of 25 feet. It is assembled by members of the [http://orgs.unt.edu/talons'''Talons'''] spirit group the week before Homecoming and is lit on the Friday night of Homecoming week (when a burn ban is not in effect).
* [http://incipientstage.20megsfree.com/images/boomerlimberfouts1_792x594.jpg'''Boomer the Cannon'''], hand crafted from solid oak on the Denton campus, the 7/8th scale M1841 6 pound, smooth bore muzzleloader cannon has been used to signify scores by the Mean Green since Fall 1970. Since that time "Boomer the Cannon" has gone through three different phases of restoration by Talon alumni. The final was in the Fall of 2007 in which the final phase saw him fitted with a custom Limber to assist with transportation and equipment handling.
* The [http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/pics/modela/ModelANO.jpg'''Green Machine'''] is a green 1931 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan and is driven by members of the [http://orgs.unt.edu/talons/cannoncrew.htm Talons Cannon Crew] at home football games and special events. This should not be confused with the ''Mean Green Machine,'' a large mechanical eagle trailed by remote panel in a truck, controlled by three physics students, that made Homecoming and other appearances between 1968 and 1976. The Green Machine is currently undergoing an overhaul by members of Talons Cannon Crew.
* [http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/images/s02flyinge.jpg'''"In High Places"'''], a 22-foot-tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by Gerald Balciar, is a popular landmark and meeting place, and is often decorated in green for school spirit. It was dedicated during the university's centennial celebrations in 1990.
