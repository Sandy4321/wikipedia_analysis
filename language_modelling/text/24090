'''Peter R. Samson''' (born [[1941]] in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]])<ref name="CHMSamson">{{cite web | author=Computer History Museum | title=Peter Samson | date=2006 | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/index.php?f=theme&s=3&ss=10 | accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[computer scientist]], best known for creating pioneering computer [[software]].

Samson studied at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) between 1958-1963. He wrote, with characteristic wit, the first editions of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]] (TMRC) [http://tmrc.mit.edu/dictionary.html dictionary], a predecessor to the [[Jargon File]].

==Dawn of software==
Working with [[Jack Dennis]] on the [[TX-0]] at MIT Building 26, he developed an interest in computing waveforms to synthesize music. For the [[PDP-1]] he wrote the [[Harmony Compiler]] with which PDP-1 users coded music.<ref name=Morris>{{cite newsgroup

He wrote the [[Expensive Planetarium]] star display for [[Spacewar!]].<ref name="Graetz">{{cite web | last=Graetz | first=J.

Also for the PDP-1 he wrote [[TJ-2]] (Type Justifying Program), the predecessor of the [[troff]] and [[nroff]] page layout programs developed at Bell Labs<ref name=DPBS>{{cite web | author=Smith, Daniel P.

B. Smith</ref>, a [[War (card game)|War]] card game, and, with [[Alan Kotok]], [[T-Square (software)|T-Square]], a drafting program that used a Spacewar! controller for an input device.<ref name=CHMMouse>{{cite video | people=Samson, Peter | year=2006 | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4995476926708958999&q=computer+history+dec | title = The Mouse That Roared: PDP-1 Celebration Event Lecture 05.15.06 | medium = [[Google Video]] | location=Mountain View, CA, USA | publisher=Computer History Museum | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

==DEC==
Samson was a contributing architect to the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) [[PDP-6]], and wrote the machine's first [[Fortran]] [[compiler]]. He is the author of [[Fortran#FORTRAN_II|Fortran II]].<ref name=SH>{{cite newsgroup

==Chinese==
At [[Systems Concepts]], he programmed the first Chinese-character digital communication system, while he was director of marketing and director of program development.

==Synthesized music==
Samson designed the Systems Concepts Digital Synthesizer. Built at Systems Concepts, it was for ten years the primary engine for the [[computer music]] group at [[Stanford University]] [[CCRMA|Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics]] (CCRMA).

==NASA==
Samson oversaw manufacturing engineering for hardware including the central memory subsystem for the [[ILLIAC IV]] [[supercomputer]] complex at the [[NASA Ames Research Center]].

==Autodesk==
At [[Autodesk]], he contributed to rendering, animation, Web browsing, and scripting languages. He received U.S. patents in software [[anti-piracy]] and [[virtual reality]].<ref name="CHMbio>{{cite web

==Subway racing==
In [[1966]] Sampson attempted to ride all lines of the [[New York City Subway]] in the shortest possible time.  True to the MIT [[hacker]] culture he enlisted a computer in planning for the event.  Despite missing out on the then fastest time, Sampson's attempt was to act as the inspiration for many similar [[subway racing]] attempts.<ref name="nyp">{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Miscione|title=The Golden Age of the All-System Subway Races|url=http://www.nypost.com/subway/subwayraces0.htm|work=New York Post Online Edition|publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc|date =2004-10-07|accessdate=2006-08-25}}</ref><ref><i>[http://www.gricer.com/anysrc/anysrc.html The Rise and Fall of the Amateur New York Subway Riding Committee]</i>, [http://www.gricer.com/ Personal Web Page of Peter R.

==Current==
Samson appears in the [[Computer History Museum]] Mouse That Roared panel discussion recorded in May 2006 to celebrate the [http://www.computerhistory.org/pdp-1/ restoration of a PDP-1]. For the restoration project he reverse-engineered music tapes from the PDP-1 era and built a player for the museum<ref name=CHMMouse/> where he is currently a docent.
