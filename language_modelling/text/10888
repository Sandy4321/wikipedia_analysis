'''Banstead''' is a [[town]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]], on the border with [[Greater London]]. It is part of the borough of [[Reigate and Banstead]]. Banstead is on the [[North Downs]] and is protected by the [[Green belt (UK)|Green Belt]]. Although a town, it is frequently referred to and known as ''Banstead Village''.

==Economy==

Every year, [[The Scout Association|Scouts]] and [[Girlguiding UK|Guides]] parade down the high street in recognition of [[Remembrance Day]] and [[St George's Day]]. The shops found in the town are those which are frequently associated with the [[upper middle class#United Kingdom upper middle class|upper middle class]], for example [[Marks & Spencer#Simply Food|Marks & Spencer Simply Food]], [[Alliance Boots|Boots the Chemist]] and [[Waitrose]]. There are also a variety of restaurants along the high street.

Other than the limited amount of employment in the [[retail]] sector based around the high street, a small number of jobs are found in the public sector; in the local authority offices and [[NHS]] facilities to the west of the Banstead's centre, and in various [[Banstead#education|schools]] across the area. However, the majority of Banstead's residents will [[commuters|commute]] out of the district for employment.

==Religion==
Banstead has several churches. The All Saints Church and Banstead Baptist Church are both located on the high street. Within the area there is also Banstead Community Church, St Anne's Catholic Church, the Methodist Church, St Paul's Church and the United Reform Church.

==Education==

* Banstead Community Junior School
* St Anne's Catholic Primary School
* Warren Mead Infant School
* Warren Mead Junior School

===Secondary===

During the time that the Beacon was called Nork Park Secondary school, it was one of only two schools in the UK to supply ball boys to the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.

==Transport==
* The majority of the town is bypassed by the [[A217]] [[dual carriageway]] to the west. The [[A roads in Zone 2 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A2022]] passes through the residential area just to the north of the town centre, however the town centre frequently suffers from [[traffic congestion]].
* There are several bus services through the town, linking to Epsom, Sutton and [[Croydon]], which all have good onward bus and rail connections.
* [[Banstead railway station]] is located to the west of the town's centre, across the A217. It is closer to [[Nork, Surrey|Nork]] than to Banstead itself therefore if travelling by public transport, it is often quicker and easier to get a train to [[Sutton railway station]] then a bus from the station concourse directly into Banstead town centre.

== Landmarks ==
* The old village well stands to the east of the town centre in Woodmansterne Lane. It is almost 300 feet deep and was last used around the end of the 19th Century. The wellhead cover dates from the 18th Century and still contains the winding gear.

* The parish church of All Saints was built around the end of the 12th Century on a site donated by [[Nigel de Mowbray]], [[Lord of the Manor]]. The West window was designed by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and produced by [[William Morris]].

* Nork Park contains the remains of the [[Colman's|Colman family]] mansion (as in ''Colman's Mustard''). There are also many apple trees which date from the original orchard and can still be seen.
