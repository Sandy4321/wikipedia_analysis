The '''Heart Mountain War Relocation Center''' was a [[relocation camp]] located in northwestern [[Wyoming]], [[United States]], on an isolated site between the towns of [[Powell, Wyoming|Powell]] and [[Cody, Wyoming|Cody]]. The camp was used to imprison [[Japanese Americans]] during much of America's involvement in [[World War II]]. The camp is named after the nearby [[Heart Mountain (Wyoming)|Heart Mountain]].

Construction on the camp began in June 1942, and the first prisoners arrived in August. By October, about ten thousand people lived at the camp, making it the third-largest settlement in Wyoming.   Most residents had been moved by train from California. The camp closed in November 1945. Several buildings in the camp still stand, though they have become decrepit with time.  A memorial, made of unfinished wood, has been erected. 

On [[June 23]], [[2007]], Heart Mountain was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref name="RafuShimpo7-7-07">{{cite news | title = Landmark Day for Heart Mountain | publisher = Rafu Shimpo | date = [[2007-07-07]] | url = http://www.rafu.com/heartmountian.html | accessdate = 2007-07-18}}</ref>
