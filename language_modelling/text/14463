'''Tropical Storm Danielle''' was a strong tropical storm that formed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and dissipated after making landfall in western [[Texas]]. The fourth [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1980 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Danielle formed as a tropical depression off the [[Louisiana]] coast on [[September 4]] and moved westward where it reached tropical storm intensity the following day. After reaching a peak intensity of {{convert|60|mph|kph}}, Danielle made landfall a few hours later before dissipating on [[September 7]] over central Texas.

Danielle produced heavy rainfall across eastern and central [[Texas]] and much of southern [[Louisiana]]. A record {{convert|17.16|in|mm}} inches of rain was reported near [[Port Arthur]], setting a new 24 hour record.<ref name="nhcb">{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|year=1980|title=Tropical Storm Danielle 1980 Report page 2|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-01-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1980-prelim/danielle/prelim02.gif}}</ref> The heavy rainfall resulted in moderate flash flooding and two fatalities Damage estimates from the storm is unknown.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Danielle 1980 track.png}}
The origins of Danielle can be traced back to a tropical wave that moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[August 22]] and became a tropical depression in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on [[August 27]] before dissipating. The remnants of the depression then interacted with a mid-level low pressure system over southern [[Florida]].<ref name="nhca">{{cite web|author=[[National Hurricane Center]]|year=1980|title=Tropical Storm Danielle Report Page 1|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-01-09|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1980-prelim/danielle/prelim01.gif}}</ref> As a result a low level circulation developed in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Miles B.

Moving west-northwest, the depression slowly intensified where it became a tropical storm on [[September 5]] and was named ''Danielle'' by the [[National Hurricane Center]].<ref name="nhca"/>

Danielle was a tropical storm for only 11 hours before making landfall, the winds of Danielle peaked at 60 mph (95 km/h) and its barometric pressure fell to 1004 [[millibars]] before the storm made landfall near [[Galveston, Texas]]. Danielle was then downgraded to tropical depression as the storm moved inland on its westerly track. Danielle then dissipated on [[September 7]] near [[Del Rio, Texas]] and the moisture associated with the remnants of the storm continued westward for the next two days.<ref name="nhca"/>

The [[National Weather Service]] forecasted the storm to produce {{convert|3|in|mm}}-{{convert|5|in|mm}} of rain and issued [[flash flood]] watches from [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]] to [[Sabine Pass]].<ref name="ig">{{cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1980|title=Tropical Storm Danielle strikes Texas|publisher=Indiana Gazette|accessdate=2008-01-09|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=110378662_clean&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> Offshore, an oil rig reported winds of {{convert|60|mph|kph}} with gusts reaching up to {{convert|81|mph|kph}} and a barometric pressure of 1004&nbsp;millibars (which was the storms overall lowest pressure).<ref name="nhca"/> In the [[Gulf of Mexico]], rough seas from Danielle caused a maintenance barge to capsize, spilling all 11 crewmen overboard. All but one crewman were rescued by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. Danielle also caused a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crashed into the sea due to high winds and lack of fuel. All twelve crew men were rescued.<ref name="ig"/> Offshore, a barge encountered winds of {{convert|58|mph|kph}} with gusts up to {{convert|92|mph|kph}} and light rainfall.<ref name="nhca"/>
