==History==
The area became organized under late Roman Empire as part of the [[Diocese of the East]], in which it was included together with the provinces of [[Isauria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]] (until 536), [[Euphratensis]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Osroene]], Phoenice and [[Arabia Petraea]]. Under Byzantium, a new subdivision did further split the province of Cilicia into Cilicia Prima, Cilicia Secunda; Syria Palaestina was split into Syria Prima, Syria Salutaris, Phoenice Lebanensis, Palaestina Prima, [[Palaestina Secunda]] and eventually also Palaestina Salutaris (in 6th century).

Despite Christian domination, through 4th and 5th centuries the Samaritans could develop a semi-autonomy at the hill country of Samaria, a move which gradually escalated into a series of open revolts. The four major [[Samaritan Revolts]] during this period caused a near extinction of Samaritan community, as well as significant Christian losses. In the late 6th century, Byzantines and their Christian [[Ghassanid]] allies took a clear upper hand in the struggle. 

In 614, Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda were [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|conquered]] by a joint Sassanid and Jewish army, creating a short-living Jewish Sassanid Commonwealth. The event schocked the Christian society, as many of its churches were destroyed and the True Cross taken by the Persians to [[Ctesiphon]]. After withdrawal of the Persian troops and the afterward surrender of the local Jewish rebels, the area was shortly reannexed into Byzantium in 628 CE.<ref>Greatrex-Lieu(2002), II, 196</ref>

Byzantine control of the province was again and irreversibly lost in 636, with the [[Muslim conquest of Syria]].


==Demographics==
The province of Palaestina Prima included a mixed Greek and Aramaic-speaking population, with Greek and Roman Christian Byzantines ([[Melchites]]) forming one of its largest demographic groups. [[Samaritans]] were the second dominating population, which populated most of the hill country of Samaria, numbering around one million in the 4th and 5th centuries. Minorities of Jews, Christian Ghassanids and Nabateans were present as well, as the first formed a majority in the neighbouring [[Palaestina Secunda]] (the Galilee) and the second and third roaming the southern and eastern deserts of Arabia.

==Religion==
During the Byzantine period Palestina Prima became the center of [[Christianity]], attracting numerous monks and religious scholars.
