The '''Alpine Spaniel''' is an extinct breed of dog which was used in [[SAR dog|mountain rescues]] by the [[Augustinian]] [[canons regular|Canons]], who run hospices in the region around the [[Great St. Bernard Pass]]. The [[spaniel]] was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is [[Barry (dog)|Barry]], however his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] and the [[Clumber Spaniel]].

==Description==
The Alpine was a large breed of spaniel, described as reaching two feet at the [[withers]]<ref name="3king163">{{cite book |title=Illustrated Natural History of the Three Kingdoms: Containing Scientific and Popular Descriptions of Man, Quadrupeds, Birds, Fishes, Reptiles, Insects, &c.

Old skulls in the collection of the Natural History Museum in Bern demonstrate a diversity in head shapes. The collection proves at least two distinct variations during the same time period. The larger skulls have a greater pronounced stop with a shorter [[snout|muzzle]] while the smaller skulls show a great deal less stop whilst having longer muzzles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_5.html |title=The Dogs from the Hospice |author= |date= |work=Natural History Museum, Berne |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091103073326/http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_5.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=2009-11-03}}</ref>

==History==
[[image:Barry dog.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the stuffed body of [[Barry (dog)|Barry]], a dog owned by the [[Great St Bernard Hospice]] around 1800 prior to the modifications made in 1923.]]
Alpine spaniels were kept by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for travellers during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland.<ref name="bio279"/><ref name="messy">{{cite web |url=http://www.messybeast.com/history/1853dogs-1.htm |title=Dog Breeds In 1853 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=MessyBeast.com |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them would return to the canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals.<ref name="bio280">{{cite book |title=Biographical Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs |last=Brown |first=Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1829 |publisher=Simpkin & Marshall |location= |isbn= |page=280 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cC6FoV8cND4C&pg=PA278&dq=alpine+spaniel#v=onepage&q=alpine%20spaniel&f=false |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> The Alpine breed was also used as a [[Guard dog|watchdog]] to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the [[Himalayas]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Canine Pathology: Or, a Description of the Diseases of Dogs, With Their Causes, Symptoms, and Mode of Care |last=Pritchett Blaine |first=Delabere |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1841 |publisher=Hubbard Press |edition= |isbn= |page=16 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hPIOAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22alpine+spaniel%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22alpine%20spaniel%22&f=false |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref>

Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry lived as a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough at the time for his body to be preserved at the [[Natural History Museum of Bern]]. However during the preservation, the taxidermist and the director of the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_9.html |title=The Legendary Barry at the Natural History Museum |author= |date= |work=Natural History Museum, Berne |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091102141931/http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_9.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=2009-11-02}}</ref> 

In 1829 a [[English Mastiff|Mastiff]] like dog was brought from the Great St Bernard Hospice and was exhibited in London and [[Liverpool]] to thousands of people. This publicised the existence of an [[Alpine Mastiff]], but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications.<ref name="richardson"/>

Because of the treacherous conditions in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839.<ref>{{cite book |title=Roads And Railroads, Vehicles, & Modes Of Travelling Of Ancient And Modern Countries; With Accounts Of Bridges, Tunnels & Canals |last=|first=|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1839 |publisher=John W.

===St. Bernard===
The Alpine Spaniel was one of the direct genetic progenitors to the [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]].<ref>{{cite web |last=|first= |url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles04/dogs77.shtml |title=The Spaniel Family |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Antiques Digest |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.<ref name="smith">{{cite web |last=Blumberg |first=Jess |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/world-history/st-bernard-200801.html?c=y&page=2 |title=A Brief History of the St. Bernard Rescue Dog |author= |date=2008-01-08 |work= |publisher=Smithsonian.com |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref>

In 1855 a stud book was opened for these crosses, which supplied the hospice with suitable dogs and also exported the dogs overseas. Many people began breeding them indiscriminately, which resulted in their modern appearance.<ref name="smith"/> By 1868, the breed was commonly being referred to as the "Saint Bernard Dog" first and the Alpine Spaniel second.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pictures and Stories of Animals |last=Tenney |first=Sanborn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1868 |publisher=Sheldon and Company |location= |isbn= |page=40 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lZgWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA40&dq=%22alpine+spaniel%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22alpine%20spaniel%22&f=false |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref>

===Clumber Spaniel===
It is thought that the [[Clumber Spaniel]] originated in 18th century [[France]] from the [[Basset Hound]] and the Alpine Spaniel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/clumber_spaniel/ |title=AKC Meet The Breeds: Clumber Spaniel |author= |date= |work=American Kennel Club |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091124015502/http://www.akc.org/breeds/clumber_spaniel/| archivedate= 24 November 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The name "Clumber" itself comes from [[Clumber Park]], [[Nottinghamshire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/spanielclumber.htm |title=Clumber Spaniel - Breed Description & Information |author= |date= |work=Canada's Guide to Dogs |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100103120125/http://canadasguidetodogs.com/spanielclumber.htm| archivedate= 3 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
