The '''American Black Vulture''', ''Coragyps atratus'', also known as the '''Black Vulture''', is a [[bird]] in the [[New World vulture]] family which lives from the southeastern [[United States]] to [[South America]]. Although a common and widespread species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the [[Turkey Vulture]], which breeds well into [[Canada]] and south to [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is unrelated to the [[Eurasian Black Vulture]]. The latter species is an [[Old World vulture]] in the family [[Accipitridae]] (which includes [[eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[kite (bird)|kite]]s and [[harrier (bird)|harrier]]s), whereas the American species is a [[New World vulture]]. It is the only extant member of the genus ''Coragyps'', which is in the family [[Cathartidae]]. It inhabits relatively open areas which provide scattered forests or shrublands.<ref name="BirdLife"/> With a wingspan of 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) the American Black Vulture is a large bird but is relatively small for a vulture. It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked [[beak]].

The American Black Vulture is a [[scavenger]] and feeds on [[carrion]], but will also eat eggs or kill new born animals. In areas populated by humans, it also feeds at garbage dumps. It finds its meals using either its keen eyesight or by following other vultures which possess a sense of smell. Lacking a [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]]&mdash;the vocal organ of birds&mdash;its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses.<ref name ="Feduccia"/> It lays its eggs in caves, hollow trees, or on the bare ground and generally raises two chicks each year, which it feeds by [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]]. In the [[United States of America]], the vulture receives legal protection under the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]].<ref name="FWS"/> This vulture also appeared in [[Mayan codices]].

There are three subspecies of American Black Vulture:
*''C. a. atratus'', named by the German ornithologist [[Johann Matth<U+00E4>us Bechstein]] in 1793, is known as the North American Black Vulture. It is the nominate subspecies. It is approximately the same size as ''C. a. foetens'', but its plumage is not as dark. Its range stretches from northern [[Mexico]] through [[Texas]] and the southern [[United States]] north to the [[Carolinas]].<ref name ="Blake"/>
* ''C. a. brasiliensis'' named by [[Charles Lucien Jules Laurent Bonaparte]] in [[1850]], is known as the Southern American Black Vulture. It is smaller than ''C. a. atratus'' and ''C. a. foetens''. The light markings on the undersides of the primaries are whiter and broader than those of the other subspecies, and the underwing coverts are lighter than those of ''C. a. foetens''.<ref name ="Blake"/> It is found in [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]]. To the south, the range extends to the coastal regions of [[Peru]] on the west and the lowlands of Bolivia on the east. To the north, it stretches to [[Sonora]] in western [[Mexico]] and [[San Luis Potos<U+00ED>]] in eastern Mexico. It is not found in high-altitude regions.<ref name ="Blake">{{cite book

===Evolutionary history of ''Coragyps''===
From the [[Early Pleistocene|Early]] to the [[Late Pleistocene]], a prehistoric species of Black Vulture, ''Coragyps occidentalis'', known as the Pleistocene Black Vulture or, somewhat in error, the "Western Black Vulture", occurred across the present species' range. This bird did not differ much from the American Black Vulture of today except in size; it was some 10-15% larger, and had a relatively flatter and wider bill.<ref>{{cite journal

Fossil (or subfossil) Black Vultures cannot necessarily be attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as ''Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus'' as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as [[Rancho La Brea]]) which constituted the [[nominate subspecies]] ''C. o. occidentalis''.<ref>{{cite journal

The American Black Vulture also occasionally feeds on livestock or deer. It is the only species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows which are giving birth, but primarily preys on new-born calves. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group, then peck at the calf's eyes, or at the nose or the tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures.<ref>{{cite web

===Reproduction===
The timing of American Black Vultures' breeding season varies with the latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March.<ref name = "Ferguson">{{cite book

Some in South America breed even later than that&mdash;American Black Vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February.<ref name = "Ferguson"/> Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads.<ref name="Terres"/> They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.<ref name = "Ferguson"/>

The American Black Vulture lays its [[egg (biology)|eggs]] on the ground in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than 3&nbsp;meters (10&nbsp;ft) above the ground.<ref name="Terres"/> While it generally does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the [[Bird nest|nest]] with bits of brightly-colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps.<ref name ="Harrison"/> [[Clutch]] size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and on average measures 7.56 by 5.09&nbsp;centimeters (3 by 2&nbsp;in).

The American Black Vulture appears in a variety of [[Maya]] hieroglyphics in [[Mayan codices]]. It is normally connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture<U+2019>s glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the [[King Vulture]] has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the American Black Vulture<U+2019>s open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the King Vulture<U+2019>s knob and are painted black.<ref name=" Maya"> {{cite book | last = Tozzer| first =Alfred Marston | coauthors =Glover Morrill Allen| title =Animal Figures in the Maya Codices| publisher =Harvard University| date =1910| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=l4h4vTjnAUUC&dq=King+Vulture++Maya&output=html}}</ref>
