'''Malcolm X''' (born '''Malcolm Little'''; [[May 19]], [[1925]] &ndash; [[February 21]], [[1965]]), also known as '''[[Hajji|El-Hajj]] [[Malik]] El-[[Shabazz (name)|Shabazz]]''',<ref>This name includes the [[honorific]] [[El-Hajj]], which is given to a Muslim who has completed the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]]. {{cite book|title=Islam: A very short introduction|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|author=Malise Ruthven|date=1997|isbn=978-0-19-285389-9|pages=147}}</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[Islam in the African diaspora|Black Muslim]] minister and a spokesman for the [[Nation of Islam]]. 

After leaving the Nation of Islam in 1964, he made the pilgrimage, the [[Hajj]], to [[Mecca]] and became a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]].  He also founded the [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]] and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]]. Less than a year later, he was [[assassination|assassinated]] in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] on the first day of National Brotherhood Week.

Historian [[Robin D.G. Kelley]] wrote, "Malcolm X has been called many things: [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]], father of [[Black Power]], [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]], closet [[Black conservatism|conservative]], incipient [[Socialism|socialist]], and a menace to society. The meaning of his public life <U+2014> his [[Political philosophy|politics]] and [[ideology]] <U+2014> is contested in part because his entire body of work consists of a few dozen speeches and a [[Ghostwriter#Nonfiction|collaborative]] [[autobiography]] whose veracity is challenged. Malcolm has become a sort of ''[[tabula rasa]]'', or blank slate, on which people of different positions can write their own interpretations of his politics and legacy. [[Chuck D]] of the [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Clarence Thomas]] can both declare Malcolm X their hero."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kelley |first=Robin D.G. |authorlink=Robin D.G.

==Early years==
[[Image:Malcolm-x.jpg|thumb|right|185px|The young Malcolm X.]]

Malcolm Little was born in 1925 in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], to Earl Little and Louise Helen ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Norton).  He lived briefly at [[Malcolm X House Site|3448 Pinkney Street]] in the [[North Omaha, Nebraska|North Omaha]] neighborhood. His father was an outspoken [[Baptist]] [[lay]] speaker and supporter of [[Marcus Garvey]], as well as a member of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].<ref>David Haward Bain, ''The Old Iron Road: An Epic of Rails, Roads, and the Urge to Go West'' (Penguin Books, 2004, ISBN 0-14-303526-6), pp. 65-66.</ref> Three of Earl Little's brothers died violently at the hands of white men, and one of his uncles had been [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]].<ref>''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', p. 2.</ref>

Earl Little had three children (Ella, Mary, and Earl, Jr.) by a previous marriage before he married Malcolm's mother. From his second marriage he had seven children, of whom Malcolm was the fourth.  Earl and Louise Little's children's names were, in order, Wilfred, Hilda, Philbert, Malcolm, Reginald, Wesley, and Yvonne. Louise had her youngest son, Robert Little, several years after her husband's death by an unnamed relationship.

Louise Little was born in [[Grenada]], and Malcolm said she looked like a white woman. Her father was a white man of whom Malcolm knew nothing except what he described as his mother's shame. Malcolm got his light complexion from him. Initially he felt it was a status symbol to be light-skinned, but later he would say that he <U+201C>hated every drop of that white rapist's blood that is in me.<U+201D>  As Malcolm was the lightest child in the family, he felt that his father favored him; however, his mother treated him harshly for the same reason.<ref>''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', pp. 2-3.</ref> One of his nicknames, "Red," derived from the reddish tinge of his hair. He was described as having, at birth, "ash-blonde hair ... tinged with cinnamon," and at four, "reddish-blonde hair." His hair darkened as he aged but also resembled the hair of his paternal grandmother, whose hair "turned reddish in the summer sun."<ref>Bruce Perry, ''Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America'' (Station Hill Press, 1991, ISBN 0-88268-103-6), pp. 2, 4.</ref>

According to ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]],'' his mother had been threatened by [[Ku Klux Klan]]smen while she was pregnant with him in December 1924.  His mother recalled the Klansmen warned the family to leave Omaha, because Earl Little's activities with [[Universal Negro Improvement Association|UNIA]] were "stirring up trouble".<ref name="timeline">[http://www.brothermalcolm.net/mxtimeline.html Chronology of the Life and Activities of Malcolm X], Malcolm X: A Research Site.</ref>

The family relocated to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], in 1926, and to [[Lansing, Michigan]], shortly after.  In 1931, Malcolm's father was found dead, having been run over by a streetcar in Lansing. Authorities ruled his death a [[suicide]].<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/assassins/malcolm_x/index.html Assassination of Malcolm X, Black Muslim], The Crime Library.</ref> Malcolm said that the black community disputed the cause of death. His family had frequently found themselves the target of harassment by the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a [[white supremacist]] group his father accused of burning down their home in 1929, and many blacks felt that the Black Legion had killed Earl Little.<ref>[http://www.masnet.org/prof_personality.asp?id=629 Malcolm X 1925-1965], Muslim American Society.</ref> Malcolm doubted that his father could "bash himself in the head, then get down across the streetcar tracks to be run over."<ref name=Auto11>''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', p. 11.</ref>

Though Malcolm<U+2019>s father had two [[life insurance]] policies, his mother received death benefits solely from the smaller policy.  Malcolm said the insurance company that had issued the larger policy accepted the police determination that Earl Little's death had been a suicide, and accordingly refused to pay.<ref name=Auto11/> Louise Little had a [[nervous breakdown]] and was declared legally [[Insanity|insane]] in December 1938. Malcolm and his siblings were split up and sent to different [[foster home]]s. Louise Little was formally committed to the state mental hospital at [[Kalamazoo, Michigan]].  She remained there until Malcolm and his brothers and sisters secured her release 26 years later.

In his ''Autobiography'', written more than 25 years later, Malcolm said that after the death of his father he lived on Charles Street in downtown [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]].  The 1930 [[U.S. Census]] showed him living on a different Charles Street, in the low-income Urbandale neighborhood in [[Lansing Charter Township, Michigan|Lansing Township]], between Lansing and East Lansing.  Later, when he was in high school, Malcolm Little  lived in [[Mason, Michigan|Mason]], an almost all-white small town 12 miles (19 km) to the south.

Malcolm Little graduated from [[junior high school]] at the top of his class but dropped out soon after a teacher told him that his aspirations of being a [[lawyer]] were "no realistic goal for a <!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS EXACT QUOTE. THANK YOU --> [[nigger]]".<ref>''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', p. 36.</ref> After enduring a series of foster homes, Malcolm was sent to a detention center.  Then he moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to live with his older half-sister, Ella Little Collins. In Boston he held a variety of jobs and intermittently found employment with the [[New Haven Railroad]]. In 1942, at age 17, Malcolm became "involved with Boston's underworld fringe."<ref name="timeline"/>

==Young adult years==
Malcolm left Boston to live for a short time in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] and [[Inkster, Michigan|Inkster]], [[Michigan]].  He moved to [[New York City]] in 1943. There he worked again briefly for the New Haven Railroad. Malcolm found work as a [[shoeshiner]] at a [[Lindy Hop]] [[nightclub]].  In ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X,'' he said that he once shined the shoes of [[Duke Ellington]] and other notable African-American [[musician]]s. After some time in [[Harlem]], he became involved in [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]], [[gambling]], [[racketeering]], [[robbery]] and steering prostitutes. During this time, his friends and acquaintances called him "Detroit Red."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/filmmore/pt.html Transcript], ''Malcolm X: Make It Plain'', [[American Experience]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].</ref> Between 1943 and 1946, when he was arrested and jailed in [[Massachusetts]], Malcolm drifted between Boston and New York City three more times.<ref name="timeline"/>

When Malcolm was examined for the [[conscription|draft]], military physicians classified him to be "mentally disqualified for military service." He explained in his autobiography that he put on a display to avoid the draft by telling the examining officer that he could not wait to "kill some [[White Cracker|crackers]]." His approach worked;  his classification ensured he would not be drafted.<ref>Ferruccio Gambino, [http://libcom.org/library/transgression-malcom-x The Transgression of a Laborer: Malcom X in the Wilderness of America], ''Radical History'', Winter 1993.</ref>

In early 1946, Malcolm returned to Boston. On [[January 12]], he was arrested for burglary trying to steal a stolen watch he had left for repairs at a jewelry shop. Two days later, Malcolm was indicted for carrying firearms. On [[January 16]], he was charged with [[Larceny|Grand Larceny]] and [[Breaking and Entering]].  Malcolm was sentenced to eight to ten years in Massachusetts State Prison.<ref name="timeline"/>

On [[February 27]], Malcolm began serving his sentence at the Massachusetts State Prison in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]]. While in prison, Malcolm earned the nickname of "[[Satan]]" for his vitriolic hatred towards the [[Bible]], [[God]] and [[religion]] in general.<ref name="massmoments">[http://www.massmoments.org/moment.cfm?mid=65 Mass Moments: Malcolm X Imprisoned, [[February 27]], [[1946]]].</ref> Malcolm met a self-educated man named Bimbi, who convinced him to educate himself.<ref name = "X-on-X">''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.</ref>. Malcolm developed a voracious appetite for reading, much of it after the prison lights had been turned off. In 1948, Malcolm received a letter from his brother, Philbert, telling him about the [[Nation of Islam]]. Malcolm wasn't interested in joining until his brother Reginald sent him a letter in which he wrote, "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison."<ref name = "X-on-X"/>

For the remainder of his incarceration, Malcolm maintained regular contact with [[Elijah Muhammad]], the group's leader.  Malcolm started to gain fame among the prisoners but also remained under the eye of the authorities.  He was denied a possible early release after five years.

In February 1948, mostly through his sister's efforts, Malcolm was transferred to an experimental prison in [[Norfolk, Massachusetts]], a facility that had a much larger library. Malcolm later reflected on his time in prison: "Months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up to then, I had never been so truly free in my life."<ref name="massmoments"/> On [[August 7]], [[1952]], Malcolm received parole and was released from prison.<ref name="timeline"/>

==Nation of Islam==
{{Further|[[Nation of Islam]]}}
[[Image:Savioursday041.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Malcolm with Elijah Muhammad at [[Savior's Day]]]] 
{{Nation of Islam}}

In 1952, after his release from prison, Malcolm visited Elijah Muhammad in [[Chicago]]. Like many members of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm changed his surname to "X". He explained the name by saying, "The 'X' is meant to symbolize the rejection of '[[slave name]]s' and the absence of an inherited [[Africa]]n name to take its place. The 'X' is also the brand that many slaves received on their upper arm."

The [[FBI]] opened a file on Malcolm X in March 1953 after hearing that he had described himself as a [[Communist]].  Included in the file were two letters in which Malcolm used the alias "Malachi Shabazz".  In ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]'', Elijah Muhammad explained that African-Americans were "descendants of the Asian Black Nation and the tribe of Shabazz".<ref>[[Elijah Muhammad]], "Know Thyself", ''[[Message to the Blackman in America]]''.</ref>

In May 1953, the FBI concluded that Malcolm had an "asocial personality with paranoid trends (pre-[[psychotic]] [[paranoid schizophrenia]])", and that he had sought treatment for his disorder. This was supported by a letter intercepted by the FBI, dated [[June 29]], [[1950]]. The letter said, in reference to his [[4-F|4-F classification]] and rejection by the military, "Everyone has always said...Malcolm is crazy, so it isn't hard to convince people that I am."<ref>[[FBI]] report, Malcolm K. Little [sic], [[May 4]], [[1953]], p. 3. Available [http://foia.fbi.gov/malcolmx/malcolmx1.pdf online], p. 7.</ref>

Later that year, Malcolm left his half-sister Ella in Boston to stay with Elijah Muhammad in Chicago. He soon returned to Boston and became the minister of the Nation of Islam's Temple Number Eleven. 

In 1954, Malcolm was selected to lead the Nation of Islam's Temple Number Seven on [[Lenox Avenue (Manhattan)|Lenox Avenue]] in [[Harlem]]. He rapidly expanded its membership. After a local television broadcast in [[New York City]] about the Nation of Islam, Malcolm became known to a wider audience. Representatives of the print media, radio, and television frequently asked Malcolm for comments on issues. He was also sought as a spokesman by reporters from other countries.

From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he left the organization in 1964, Malcolm promoted the Nation's teachings. He referred to whites as "devils" who had been created in a misguided breeding program by a [[Yakub|black scientist]], and predicted the inevitable (and imminent) return of blacks to their natural place at the top of the social order.<ref>Frederick D. Harper, "The Influence of Malcolm X on Black Militancy", ''Journal of Black Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 4. (Jun., 1971), pp. 387-402.</ref>

Malcolm has been widely considered the second most influential leader of the movement, after Elijah Muhammad. He opened additional temples, including one in [[Philadelphia]]. He was largely credited with increasing membership in the Nation of Islam from 500 in 1952 to 30,000 in 1963. He inspired the boxer Cassius Clay (later known as [[Muhammad Ali]]) to join the Nation of Islam. Like Malcolm, Ali later left the Nation of Islam and joined mainstream [[Islam]].

===Marriage and family===
In 1958, Malcolm married [[Betty Shabazz|Betty X (n<U+00E9>e Sanders)]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. They had six daughters, all of whom carried the [[family name]] of Shabazz. Their names were Attallah, born in 1958; [[Qubilah Shabazz|Qubilah]], born in 1960; [[Ilyasah Shabazz|Ilyasah]], born in 1962; Gamilah (also spelled Gumilah), born in 1964; and twins, Malaak and Malikah, born after Malcolm's death in 1965.

===Meeting Castro===
In September 1960, Malcolm met with [[Fidel Castro]] during Castro's visit to the [[United Nations]] in New York.  Malcolm was a prominent member of a Harlem-based welcoming committee made up of black community leaders that greeted heads of state, particularly those from African countries, who had come to New York to address the [[UN General Assembly]].

==Tensions and departure from the Nation of Islam==
In early 1963, Malcolm started collaborating with [[Alex Haley]] on ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]''. The book had not been finalized at the time of Malcolm's assassination in 1965. Haley completed it and published it later that year.<ref>In 1964, Malcolm told Haley, "If I<U+2019>m alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle." Alex Haley, Epilogue, ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', p. 410.</ref>

Writing after his break from the Nation of Islam, Malcolm said in the ''Autobiography'' that one reason for the separation was growing tension between him and Elijah Muhammad that arose from Malcolm's dismay at rumors of  Muhammad's extramarital affairs with young secretaries. These rumors troubled Malcolm because the Nation of Islam condemns [[adultery]]. At first Malcolm brushed these rumors aside. Later, he spoke with Elijah Muhammad's son and the women making the accusations and he came to believe them.  According to the ''Autobiography,'' in 1963 Elijah Muhammad confirmed the rumors to Malcolm.  Muhammad justified his actions by saying they followed a pattern established by Biblical prophets. 

Malcolm criticized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], which he called "the farce on Washington". He said he didn't know why black people were excited over a demonstration "run by [[White (people)|whites]] in front of a statue of a [[President of the United States|president]] who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive." 

When asked for a comment about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]] in November 1963, Malcolm said that it was a case of "the chickens coming home to roost." He added that "Chickens coming home to roost never made me sad. It only made me glad."  This remark prompted a widespread public outcry.  The Nation of Islam publicly censured their former shining star; although Malcolm retained his post and rank as minister, Elijah Muhammad banned him from public speaking for 90 days. 

[[Image:Malcolmxmartinlutherking.jpg|thumb|right|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and Malcolm X, [[March 26]], [[1964]]]]
Malcolm publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam on [[March 8]], [[1964]].  He founded the [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]] four days later. Malcolm stayed close to some of the teachings of the Nation of Islam but began modifying them.  He explicitly advocated political and economic [[black nationalism]], as opposed to the Nation of Islam's religious nationalism. In April, he made a speech titled "[http://www.historicaldocuments.com/BallotortheBulletMalcolmX.htm The Ballot or the Bullet]." Malcolm was in contact with several orthodox Muslims, who encouraged him to learn about orthodox Islam. He soon converted to orthodox Islam, and decided to make his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]].

==Pilgrimage to Mecca==
On [[April 13]], [[1964]], Malcolm departed [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]], [[New York]] for [[Cairo]] by way of [[Frankfurt]]. It was the second time Malcolm had been to Africa. On the next leg of his journey, Malcolm left Cairo for [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].  His status as an authentic Muslim was questioned by Saudi authorities because of his inability to speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and his United States [[passport]]. Since only confessing Muslims are allowed into [[Mecca]], he was separated from the group with which he arrived and was isolated. He spent about 20 hours wearing the [[ihram]], a two-piece garment comprising two white unhemmed sheets.

According to the ''Autobiography,'' Malcolm X remembered the book ''The Eternal Message of Muhammad'' by [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam]], which Dr. Mahmoud Yousseff Sharwabi had presented with his visa approval.  He called Azzam's son, who arranged for his release.  At the younger Azzam's home, he met Azzam Pasha, who gave Malcolm his suite at the Jeddah Palace Hotel.  The next morning, Muhammad Faisal, the son of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]], visited and informed Malcolm X that he was to be a state guest. The deputy chief of protocol accompanied Malcolm X to the Hajj Court, where he was allowed to make his pilgrimage.

On [[April 19]], Malcolm completed the [[Hajj]], making the seven circuits around the [[Kaaba]], drinking from the [[Zamzam Well]] and running between the hills of [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|Safah and Marwah]] seven times.  According to the ''Autobiography,'' on this trip Malcolm viewed Muslims of different [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]s interacting as equals and came to believe that Islam could transcend racial problems.

==International travel==
===Africa===
{{Pan-African|left}}
Malcolm X visited Africa on three separate occasions, once in 1959 and twice in 1964. During his visits, he met officials, as well as spoke on television and radio in: [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]; [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]; [[Dar Es Salaam]], [[Tanganyika]] (now [[Tanzania]]); [[Lagos]] and [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Accra]], [[Winneba]], and [[Legon]], [[Ghana]]; [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]]; [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]]; and [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]. 

Malcolm first went to Africa in summer of 1959. He traveled to [[Egypt]] ([[United Arab Republic]]), [[Sudan]],  [[Nigeria]] and [[Ghana]] to arrange a tour for Elijah Muhammad, which occurred in December 1959. The first of Malcolm's two trips to Africa in 1964 lasted from [[April 13]] until [[May 21]]. On [[May 8]], following his speech at Trenchard Hall on the campus of the [[University of Ibadan]] in Nigeria, he attended a reception in the Students' Union Hall held for him by the Muslim Students' Society. During this reception the students bestowed upon him the name "Omowale", meaning "the son returns home" in the [[Yoruba language]]. 

Malcolm returned to New York from Africa via [[Paris]] on [[May 21]], [[1964]]. On [[July 9]], he again left the U.S. for Africa, spending a total of 18 weeks abroad. On [[July 17]], [[1964]], Malcolm addressed the [[Organization of African Unity]]'s first ordinary assembly of heads of state and governments in Cairo as a representative of the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity|OAAU]]. On [[August 21]], [[1964]], he made a press statement on behalf of the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity|OAAU]] regarding the second African summit conference of the [[OAU]]. In it, he explained how a strong and independent "[[United States of Africa]]" is a victory for the awakening of [[African American]]s. By the time he returned to the United States on [[November 24]], [[1964]], Malcolm had established an international connection between Africans on the continent and those in the [[diaspora]].

Malcolm held to the view that African-Americans were right in defending themselves from aggressors. On [[June 28]], [[1964]], at the founding rally of the OAAU he said, 
: "''The time for you and me to allow ourselves to be brutalized nonviolently has passed.  Be nonviolent only with those who are nonviolent to you.  And when you can bring me a nonviolent racist, bring me a nonviolent [[segregation]]ist, then I'll get nonviolent.  But don't teach me to be nonviolent until you teach some of those [[white cracker|crackers]] to be nonviolent.''"<ref>Malcolm X, [http://www.panafricanperspective.com/mxoaaufounding.html OAAU Founding Rally].</ref>

In an interview with [[Gordon Parks]] in 1965, Malcolm revealed:<br>
: "''I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another. Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant &mdash; the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get together &mdash; and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a [[zombie]] then &mdash; like all [Black] Muslims &mdash; I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years. That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days &mdash; I'm glad to be free of them."

In 1965, he stated, <U+201C>My mind is wide open to anybody who will help get the ape off our backs.<U+201D><ref>Raymond Rodgers; Jimmie N. Rogers, "The Evolution of the Attitude of Malcolm X toward Whites", ''Phylon'', Vol. 44, No. 2. (2nd Qtr., 1983), pp. 108-115.</ref>

===France and the UK===
In late 1964, Malcolm visited [[France]] together with [[Jamaica]]n officials and spoke in Paris at Salle Pleyel where there were discussions and debates on the subject of the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] ideas espoused by both the Jamaicans present and Malcolm X at that time. He also visited the UK and participated in a debate at the [[Oxford Union]] on [[December 3]], [[1964]].<ref>[http://www.brothermalcolm.net/2003/mx_oxford/index.html  Malcolm X Oxford Debate], Malcolm X: A Research Site.</ref>

On [[February 12]], [[1965]], Malcolm visited [[Smethwick]], near [[Birmingham]], which had become a byword for racial division after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]] when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the parliamentary seat after rumours that their candidates supporters had used the slogan "If you want a nigger for your neighbour, vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]".<ref>National Extension College, A2 Government & Politics, [http://intranet1.sutcol.ac.uk:888/NEC/MATERIAL/PDFS/GOV_POL/A2GOV_PO/08U4_T4.PDF Topic 4 <U+2013> Race and ethnicity], p. 4.</ref>

==Death and afterwards==
[[Image:Malcomxm1carbine3gr.gif|left|300px|thumb|Malcolm X holding an [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] and peering out of a window in 1964. The photo illustrated his intention to defend himself against the frequent death threats he was receiving.]]

===Assassination===
Tensions increased between Malcolm and the Nation of Islam. It was alleged that orders were given by leaders of the Nation of Islam to "destroy" Malcolm; in ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', he says that as early as 1963, a member of the Seventh Temple confessed to him having received orders from the Nation of Islam to kill him.

On [[March 20]], [[1964]], [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] published a photograph of Malcolm holding an [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] and pulling back the curtains to peer out of the window of his family's home. The photo was taken in connection with Malcolm's declaration that he would defend himself from the daily death threats which he and his family were receiving. Undercover FBI informants warned officials that he had been marked for assassination. 

In June 1964, the NOI sued to reclaim Malcolm's home in [[Queens]], which they claimed belonged to the organization. The suit was successful, and Malcolm and his family were ordered to vacate the house. On [[February 14]], [[1965]], the night before a scheduled hearing to postpone the eviction date, the house burned to the ground. Malcolm and his family survived, and no one was charged with any crime.

On [[February 21]], [[1965]] in Manhattan's [[Audubon Ballroom]], Malcolm had just begun delivering a speech when a disturbance broke out in the crowd of 400.  A man yelled, "Get your hand outta my pocket!  Don't be messin' with my pockets!"  As Malcolm and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance,<ref>In the Epilogue to ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', Alex Haley wrote that Malcolm said, "Hold it! Hold it! Don't get excited. Let's cool it brothers." (p. 434.) According to a transcription of a recording of the shooting, Malcolm's only words were, "Hold it!", which he repeated 10 times. (Louis A. DeCaro, Jr., ''On the Side of My People: A Religious Life of Malcolm X'' (New York University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-8147-1864-7), p. 274.)</ref> a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a [[sawed-off shotgun]].  Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns at Malcolm, who was shot 16 times. Angry onlookers in the crowd caught and beat the assassins as they attempted to flee the ballroom. Malcolm was pronounced dead on arrival at New York's [[Columbia Presbyterian Hospital]]. 

[[Image:Malcolm X - death.jpg|thumb|right|300px|After the assassination: Malcolm X on a [[stretcher]], ''en route'' from the [[Audubon Ballroom]] to [[Columbia Presbyterian Hospital]].]]

Two suspects were named by witnesses <U+2014> [[Norman 3X Butler]] and Thomas 15X Johnson, both members of the Nation of Islam.

Three men were eventually charged in the case. [[Talmadge Hayer]], also a Black Muslim, confessed to having fired shots into Malcolm's body, but he testified that Butler and Johnson were not present and were not involved in the shooting. All three were convicted.

Norman 3X Butler, now known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was paroled in 1985 and became the head of the Nation of Islam's Harlem Mosque in New York in 1998. He continues to maintain his innocence.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/71838.stm Malcolm X killer heads mosque], [[BBC News]], [[March 31]], [[1998]].</ref> Thomas 15X Johnson, now known as Khalil Islam, was released from prison in 1987. He, too, says that he was not involved in the assassination.<ref>[http://nymag.com/news/features/38358/ The Man Who Didn<U+2019>t Shoot Malcolm X], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', [[October 1]], [[2007]].</ref>

===Funeral===
Malcolm's body was made available for public viewing in Harlem's Unity Funeral Home from [[February 23]] through [[February 26]], [[1965]], and the number of mourners who filed past his body has been estimated between 14,000 and 30,000.<ref>Perry, p. 374. Alex Haley, in his Epilogue to ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'', says 22,000 (p. 452).</ref> Malcolm's funeral was held on [[February 27]], [[1965]], at the Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, also in Harlem. The Church was filled to capacity, with more than 1,700 people. [[Ossie Davis]] delivered a [[eulogy]], describing Malcolm as "our shining black prince."

<blockquote>There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain <U+2014> and we will smile. Many will say turn away <U+2014> away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man <U+2014> and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate <U+2014> a fanatic, a racist <U+2014> who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him.<ref>Ossie Davis, [http://www.cmgworldwide.com/historic/malcolm/about/eulogy.htm Eulogy delivered at the funeral of Malcolm X], Faith Temple Church Of God, [[February 27]], [[1965]].</ref></blockquote>

Malcolm X was buried at the [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]]. At the gravesite after the ceremony, friends took the shovels away from the waiting gravediggers and buried Malcolm themselves.  Later that month, actors [[Ruby Dee]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] became co-chairs of the New York affiliate of the Educational Fund for the Children of Malcolm X Shabazz.

===Response to Malcolm's death===
After Malcolm's death, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], sent a telegram to Betty Shabazz, expressing his sadness over "the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband."

<blockquote>While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and the root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems we face as a race.<ref>Martin Luther King, Jr., [http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/papers/unpub/650226-001_To_Betty_Shabazz.htm Telegram to Betty Shabazz], [[February 26]], [[1965]].</ref></blockquote>

[[Elijah Muhammad]] reacted differently; as he told the annual [[Savior's Day]] convention on [[February 26]], "Malcolm X got just what he preached."<ref>Karl Evanzz, ''The Judas Factor: The Plot to Kill Malcolm X'' (Thunder's Mouth Press, 1992, ISBN 1-56025-049-6) p. 301.</ref>

The international press, particularly that of Africa, was sympathetic. The ''[[Daily Times of Nigeria]]'' wrote, <blockquote>Like all mortals, Malcolm X was not without his faults ... but that he was a dedicated and consistent disciple of the movement for the emancipation of his brethren no one can doubt. ... Malcolm X has fought and died for what he believed to be right. He will have a place in the palace of martyrs."<ref>Evanzz, p. 305.</ref></blockquote>

''Kwangming'', published in [[Beijing]], bluntly stated that "Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights."<ref>Evanzz, p. 306.</ref>

==Allegations of conspiracy==
Within days of Malcolm's assassination, questions were raised about who was responsible for his death. On [[February 23]], [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]], the leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Black Muslims, were to blame.<ref>Perry, p. 371.</ref> Others blamed the police, the FBI, or the CIA, citing the lack of police protection and the ease with which the assassins had entered the Audubon Ballroom.<ref>Perry, p. 372.</ref>

In the 1970s, the public learned about [[COINTELPRO]] and other secret government programs to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s. John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, has been identified as an FBI agent.<ref name=Lomax198>Louis E. Lomax, ''To Kill a Black Man'', (Holloway House, 1968, ISBN 0-87067-731-4), p. 198.</ref> Malcolm had confided in a reporter that Ali had exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad, and he considered Ali his "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership.<ref name=Lomax198/> On [[February 20]], the night before the assassination, Ali met with Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm.<ref>Evanzz, p. 294.</ref>

==Popular culture==
The film ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm X]]'' was released in 1992, directed by [[Spike Lee]] and based on the autobiography. It starred [[Denzel Washington]] as Malcolm, with [[Angela Bassett]] as Betty and [[Al Freeman, Jr.]] as Elijah Muhammad. Both [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] named the film as one of the 10 best of the decade.

The 2001 film ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' also features Malcolm X, as played by [[Mario Van Peebles]].

The band [[Rage Against The Machine]] talks about him in the song "[[Wake Up (Rage Against the Machine song)|Wake Up]]" when they say "You know they (the government) murdered X, And tried to blame it on Islam".
