'''Leonce Cormier''' (born June 29, 1948) is a retired [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He was born in [[Dorchester, New Brunswick]]. He competed across Canada, in several American promotions, and wrestled internationally for both [[Puerto Rico]]'s [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC) and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) in [[New Zealand]].  In Canada, where he spent the majority of his career, Cormier used the [[ring name]] '''Leo Burke'''. In the United States, however, he competed as Tommy Martin.

Over the course of his career, Cormier held 46 wrestling championships. Several of his title victories came as part of a [[tag team]] with his brothers, three of whom were also professional wrestlers. He had long-term storyline feuds with such wrestlers as [[<U+00C1>ngel Acevedo|Cuban Assassin]] and [[Bret Hart]], both of whom he later reconciled with and joined forces with to hold tag team championships. Since his retirement in 1992, he has also trained many wrestlers for both [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). Cormier also competes in occasional wrestling matches and has been honored by both the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]], a [[Fraternity|fraternal organization]] of professional wrestlers, and [[Stampede Wrestling]], who inducted him into their hall of fame.

==Career==
Growing up in a wrestling family, Leonce Burke decided at age six that he wanted to become a professional wrestler. He followed in the footsteps of his older brothers [[Yvon Cormier|Yvon]] and [[Rudy Kay|Jean-Louis]], who trained him to compete.<ref name=slamburke/>

===1960s===
Cormier made his professional debut in 1966. Competing in [[Heart of America Sports Attractions#Central States Wrestling|Central States Wrestling]], an affiliate of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), he used the ring name Tommy Martin. He won his first championship belt on October 11, 1968 by defeating Bob Brown for the [[NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=cshw>{{cite web|title=NWA Heart of America/Central States Heavyweight Title History|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|accessdate=2009-08-01|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/cscmwnwa.html}}</ref> Later that month, he gained another title when he formed a [[tag team]] with his brother Romeo (who was competing under the ring name Terry Martin) to win the Central States version of the [[NWA North American Tag Team Championship (Central States version)|NWA North American Tag Team Championship]] from Brown and [[Bob Geigel]]. The reign as tag team champions lasted for seven days before the Martins [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dropped]] the belts in a match against The Texas Outlaws ([[Dick Murdoch]] and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]).<ref name=centraltag>{{cite web|title=NWA Central States Tag Team Title History|publisher=Solie's Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/csttnwa.html|accessdate=2009-08-021}}</ref> The following month, Martin also lost the heavyweight championship to Rhodes.<ref name=cshw/>

===1970s===
Cormier spent much of the early 1970s competing in the [[Maritimes]] for his brother Jean-Louis' [[Eastern Sports Association]] (ESA) (which owned International Wrestling, or IW) as both a singles and tag team wrestler. He did not want to use their name recognition to further his own career, so he took the last name of his friend, boxer Jackie Burke.<ref name=slamburke/> The four Cormier brothers all competed in the territory and often joined forces in [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] with the promotion's top [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (villain) wrestlers.<ref name=slam>{{cite web|title=Bobby Kay still on Maritime minds|publisher=SLAM!

The title reign lasted for three months; [[Gino Brito]] won the title from Burke during a match in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], but Burke regained the championship five days later.<ref name=nahw>{{cite web|title=North American Heavyweight Title (Maritimes)|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/esa-na-h.html|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> On August 8, 1972. Burke teamed with his brother Romeo again (who was now wrestling as Bobby Kay) to win the [[ESA International Tag Team Championship]]. They held the title until the following June, when they dropped it to [[Freddie Prosser|Fred Sweetan]] and [[Kurt and Karl Von Steiger|Kurt Von Steiger]].<ref name=esatag>{{cite web|title=Eastern Sports Association International Tag Team Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/esa-int-t.html|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> In August 1973, Burke became the first ESA Taped Fist Championship when the promotion awarded him the title.<ref name=tape>{{cite web|title=Taped-Fist Title (Maritimes)|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/esa-tf.html|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

Burke next competed in the NWA's [[Amarillo, Texas]] territory. He teamed with another brother, Yvon, who competed under the ring name The Beast. In January 1974, they defeated [[Don Fargo]] and Hank James to win the [[NWA Western States Tag Team Championship]], which they held for two months until a loss to [[Ricky Romero (wrestler)|Ricky Romero]] and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]].<ref name=westtag>{{cite web|title=NWA Western States Tag Team Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/tx/amarillo/ws-t.html|publisher=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> Returning to the ESA, Burke had a short reign as IW North American Heavyweight Champion in May 1974,<ref name=nahw/> which he followed in July with another reign with the ESA International Tag Team Championship. Holding the title with his brother The Beast, Burke held the championship for less than one month before dropping it to [[Newton Tattrie|Geto Mongol]] and Great Kuma.<ref name=esatag/> That month, he also dropped the Taped Fist Championship to Mongol but regained it in a rematch within days.<ref name=tape/> The following year, he held the North American Heavyweight Championship twice more, defeating [[Bill Eadie|Bolo Mongol]] and Bob Brown. For the second victory, Burke substituted for [[Killer Karl Krupp]], who was unable to compete. Although Burke won the match, the title was later returned to Brown after Brown appealed the decision, claiming that a substitute wrestler should not be eligible to win a championship.<ref name=nahw/> Burke also had one final reign with the Taped Fist Championship before vacating the title.<ref name=tape/>

Burke continued to compete for Central States Wrestling, and he teamed with The Beast in a tournament for the vacant NWA Western States Tag Team Championship. The brothers defeated [[Jay Youngblood|Silver Streak]] and Ricky Romero in the finals on February 20, 1976 to win the belts but lost them in a rematch one week later.<ref name=westtag/> Returning from Texas to Nova Scotia, Burke became the only person ever to hold the ESA Maritimes Heavyweight Championship. He defeated [[Brute Bernard|The Brute]] to win the title; when the ESA closed in 1977, the title became part of Romeo Cormier (Bobby Kay)'s Trans-Canada Wrestling (TCW). TCW closed later the same year, and Burke's Maritimes Heavyweight Championship was retired.<ref name=maritimes>{{cite web|title=Eastern Sports Association Maritimes Heavyweight Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/esa-maritimes-h.html|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern Sports Association|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> In 1976, Burke also defeated The Brute to begin another reign as IW North American Heavyweight Champion. He later dropped it to [[Michel Lamarche|Michel Dubois]] but regained it by defeating [[Jean Gagn<U+00E9>|Frenchy Martin]] on July 14, 1977. The title was also retired when TCW closed that month.<ref name=nahw/> Prior to the promotion closing, Burke also had a short reign with [[Hubert Gallant]] with the ESA Maritimes Tag Team Championship.<ref name=maritag>{{cite web|title=Maritimes Tag Team Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/esa/esa-maritimes-t.html|publisher=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> While competing in Nova Scotia, Burke also challenged [[Terry Funk]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. Burke controlled the majority of the encounter, but Funk intentionally got himself [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]] 55 minutes into the match. Because the title cannot change hands on a disqualification, Funk retained the belt.<ref name=pof>{{cite web|title=Leo Burke|publisher=Canadian Pro Wrestling Page of Fame|url=http://www.garywill.com/wrestling/canada/burke.htm|accessdate=2009-08-02|first=Gary|last=Will}}</ref>

In 1977, Burke moved to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]] to compete for [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Stampede Wrestling]]. He teamed with Hart's son [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]] to win the [[Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship]] in early 1977 by defeating The Cuban Assassins. Although they dropped the belts to [[The Royal Kangaroos]], Burke was able to regain the title in September 1977 while teaming with his brother Romeo (who was then competing as Bobby Burke). On December 10, however, they lost the belts to [[Michel Vigneault|Michel Martel]] and [[Mr. Hito]].<ref name=stamp>{{cite web|title=International Tag Team Champions|publisher=Stampede Wrestling|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041211182859/www.stampedewrestling.com/titlehistorytag.htm|archivedate=2004-12-11|url=http://www.stampedewrestling.com/titlehistorytag.htm|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref><ref name=stamptag2>{{cite web|title=Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Title History|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ittcalg.html|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> In the new year, Leo Burke focused on competing as a singles wrestler and won the [[Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship]] on several occasions. He defeated Don Gagne (formerly known as Frenchy Martin) for the first title and Michel Martel for the second. He won it once more, by defating Larry Lane,<ref name=stamphw>{{cite web|title=North American Heavyweight Champions|publisher=Stampede Wrestling|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041211181856/www.stampedewrestling.com/titlehistoryNA.htm|archivedate=2004-12-11|url=http://www.stampedewrestling.com/titlehistoryNA.htm|accessdate=2010-01-09}}</ref><ref name=stamphw2>{{cite web|title=Stampede Wrestling North American Heavyweight Title History|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/nahcalg.html|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> before leaving the area to compete briefly in New Zealand. Competing for the NWA territory there, he won the New Zealand version of the NWA British Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship. He soon vacated the title, however, and returned to Stampede Wrestling.<ref name=nz>{{cite web|title=British Empire/Commonwealth Heavyweight Title (New Zealand)|publisher=Wrestling

===1980s===
Upon his return to Calgary in 1980, Burke teamed with Keith Hart once again to win the promotion's International Tag Team Championship.<ref name=stamp/><ref name=stamptag2/> He also began feuding with Keith's brother [[Bret Hart]] around that time.<ref name=pof/> Burke defeated [[Mr. Pogo|Mr. Sekigawa]] to win the North American Heavyweight Championship but lost it to Bret Hart later that year. He regained it in a rematch but dropped it to Hart once again.<ref name=stamphw/><ref name=stamphw2/> Burke returned to Canada's Atlantic Coast briefly to compete for [[Grand Prix Wrestling|Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling]] (AGPW) and won the promotion's North American Tag Team Championship with [[Hubert Gallant]]. They lost the belts to [[<U+00C1>ngel Acevedo|Cuban Assassin]] and Bobby Bass that summer, but Burke was able to regain the championship by teaming with [[Stephen Petitpas]].<ref name=agpwtag>{{cite web|title=AGPW North American Tag Team Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/agpw/agpw-na-t.html|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> AGPW only promoted shows in the summer,<ref name=slamburke/> and Burke then returned to Calgary during AGPW's off-season; while there, he teamed with his brother Bobby Burke again to regain the International Tag Team Championship in December 1980.<ref name=stamp/><ref name=stamptag2/> Two months later, he had another reign as North American Heavyweight Champion after defeating [[David Schultz (professional wrestler)|"Dr. D" David Schults]] (who later regained the title in a rematch).<ref name=stamphw/><ref name=stamphw2/> Another reign as NWA Central States Heavyweight Champion followed in November 1981, in which Cormier returned to his Tommy Martin ring name.<ref name=cshw/>

Returning to Stampede Wrestling once again, Burke entered and won a tournament for the vacant North American Heavyweight Championship, defeating Duke Myers in the final match on March 21, 1982 to win the title. He dropped it back to Bret Hart three months later, however.<ref name=stamphw/><ref name=stamphw2/> He followed this with a brief return in August 1982 to AGPW, where he defeated [[Kerry Brown (wrestler)|Rick Valentine]] to win the AGPW United States Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=agpwus>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling Heavyweight Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/agpw/agpw-us-h.html|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref> On November 19, 1982, Burke teamed with his longtime rival Bret Hart to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship. After losing the title the following month,<ref name=stamp/><ref name=stamptag2/> the feud resumed, and Burke defeated Hart for the North American Heavyweight Championship on January 14, 1983; the men continued to face each other, and Hart regained the championship that May.<ref name=stamphw/><ref name=stamphw2/>

Around that time, Burke spent more of his time competing in Central and Eastern Canada. He wrestled for [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], where he feuded with [[Johnny Weaver]].<ref name=pof/> In the summer of 1983, he held both the AGPW United States Heavyweight Championship and the AGPW International Heavyweight Championship. He was also credited with an additional reign as United States Heavyweight Champion because he regained the title in a rematch after it was vacated due to a controversial match against [[Don Jardine|The Spoiler]].<ref name=agpwus>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling United States Heavyweight Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/agpw/agpw-us-h.html|publisher=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref><ref name=agpwint>{{cite web|title=Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling International Heavyweight Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/canada/maritimes/agpw/agpw-int-h.html|accessdate=2009-08-04|publisher=Wrestling Titles}}</ref> In February 1986, Burke had one final title reign in Stampede Wrestling, holding the International Tag Team Championship with Ron Ritchie.<ref name=stamp/><ref name=stamptag2/>

Back in AGPW, Burke continued to win championships. He held the International Heavyweight Championship three more times from 1986 to 1989,<ref name=agpwint/> and held the North American Tag Team Championship three times as well during that period. He won the tag team titles by reuniting with former partners Hubert Gallant and Stephen Petitpas; the third reign came with Cuban Assassin, a former enemy of the entire Cormier wrestling family.<ref name=agpwtag/><ref>{{cite web|title=Faction Profiles: The Cormier Family|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/cormier-family.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>

A turning point came in Burke's wrestling career in the late 1980s when he decided to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. He quickly won the promotion's top title, the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]], by defeating Caribbean wrestling veteran [[Carlos Col<U+00F3>n, Sr.|Carlos Col<U+00F3>n]] on December 17, 1989.

===1990s===
Burke held the WWC title until February 1990, when he dropped it to [[Savio Vega|TNT]].<ref name=univ>{{cite web|title=WWC (Puerto Rico) World Heavyweight/Universal Heavyweight Title|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/uhwwwcp.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> This was followed by a return to AGPW, where he held the tag team championship with his brother Bobby Kay.<ref name=agpwtag/> Back in Puerto Rico, Burke defeated Col<U+00F3>n again on March 24, 1990, this time  to win the [[WWC Television Championship]].<ref name=wwctv>{{cite web|title=WWC (Puerto Rico) Television Title|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/tvwwcp.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> Four days later, he also won the [[WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship]] while teaming with [[Chicky Starr]]. They won the title from [[Jos<U+00E9> Gonz<U+00E1>lez (wrestler)|Invader #1]] and Invader #4 but dropped it back to them in May.<ref name=wwctag>{{cite web|title=WWC (Puerto Rico) Caribbean Tag Team Title|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/cttwwcp.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> Shortly after dropping the tag team title, Burke defeated Invader #1 in a singles match to win the [[WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship]].<ref name=caribhw>{{cite web|title=WWC (Puerto Rico) Caribbean Heavyweight Title|publisher=Solie's Title Histories|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/chtwwcp.html|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> Burke's final title victory came in the summer of 1990, when he defeated Ron Starr to win the AGPW International Heavyweight Championship for a fifth time.<ref name=agpwint/>

==Retirement==
After retiring from full-time wrestling, he went to Calgary in the early 1992. His old rival and real-life friend Bret Hart arranged a position for Cormier as a trainer for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment). Cormier helped train [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Mark Henry]], [[Adam Copeland]] (known as Edge in WWE), [[Jason Reso]] (known as Christian in WWE), and [[Andrew Martin]] (known as Test in WWE).<ref name=slamburke/> He also trained two former [[Canadian Football League]] players for their careers in professional wrestling: former [[Edmonton Eskimos|Edmonton Eskimo]] Jeff Thomas, who later opened his own wrestling training school,<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Eskimo big man in Can-Am Jeff Thomas learning the ropes out west|first=Alex|last=Ristic|publisher=SLAM!

When Cormier's contract expired, he began training wrestlers for WWF rival World Championship Wrestling.<ref name=slamburke/> In January 2002, he was hospitalized with [[Sepsis|septicemia]] and was put on [[life support]] before recovering.<ref name=oww/><ref>{{cite web|title=Maritime legend Rudy Kay dead at 65|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/05/26/5672566.html|date=2008-05-26|accessdate=2009-08-06|first=Greg|last=Oliver|publisher=SLAM!

Since his retirement, he has worked in the now-closed bar at Calgary's Cecil Hotel and has also operated a mobile coffee and sandwich shop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Knee replacements give Leo Burke renewed energy|first=Billy|last=Powers|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/03/04/3695040-sun.html|accessdate=2009-08-05|date=2007-03-04|publisher=SLAM!

Although Cormier considers himself retired from professional wrestling, he continues to compete from time to time. He was featured in a news video by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] during a return to the Maritimes for a match in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maritime legend|date=1998-08-14|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> In June 2009, it was announced that he was participating in an Ultimate Championship Wrestling Legends Tribute Tour in Atlantic Canada alongside his brother Romeo, former tag team partner Hubert Gallant, and former rival Cuban Assassin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maritime wrestling legends booklet available at meet-and-greet, show in Berwick|publisher=''The Kings County Register''|url=http://www.novanewsnow.com/article-i351629-Maritime-wrestling-legends-booklet-available-at-meetandgreet-show-in-Berwick.html|accessdate=2009-08-05|date=2009-06-23|first=Kirk|last=Starratt}}</ref>
