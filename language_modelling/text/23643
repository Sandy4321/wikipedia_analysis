The '''''Four Freedoms''''' is a series of four 1943 oil paintings by the American artist [[Norman Rockwell]]. The paintings<U+2014>''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]], [[Freedom of Worship (painting)|Freedom of Worship]], [[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'' and ''[[Freedom from Fear (painting)|Freedom from Fear]]'' are each approximately {{convert|45.75|in|cm}} <U+00D7> {{convert|35.5|in|cm}},<ref name=S221>Schick, p. 221.</ref> and are now in the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]]. The four freedoms refer to President [[Franklin D.

Critical review of these images, like most of Rockwell's work, has not been entirely positive.

Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms<U+2014>Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want'' and ''Freedom from Fear''<U+2014>were first published on February 20, February 27, March 6 and March 13, 1943 along with commissioned essays from leading American writers and historians ([[Booth Tarkington]], [[Will Durant]], [[Carlos Bulosan]], and [[Stephen Vincent Ben<U+00E9>t]], respectively).<ref name=NRFF>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymanpress.com/titles/NormanRockwellsFourFreedoms.html|title=Norman Rockwell's Four Freedoms|accessdate=2008-04-11|publisher=The Countryman Press}}</ref>  They measure {{convert|45.75|in|cm}} <U+00D7> {{convert|35.5|in|cm}} except ''Freedom of Worship'' which measures {{convert|46.0|in|cm|1}} <U+00D7> {{convert|35.5|in|cm}}.<ref name=S221/> For all of his paintings, Rockwell used live models.<ref>Schick, p. 17.</ref> In 1935, Rockwell began using [[black-and-white]] photography of these live models extensively,<ref name=S19>Schick, p. 19.</ref> although he did not publicly reveal he did so until 1940.<ref>Schick, p. 18.</ref> The use of photography expanded the possibilities for Rockwell who could ask models to pose in positions that they could only hold for brief periods of time. He could also produce works from new perspectives and the ''Four Freedoms'' represented "low vantage point of ''Freedom of Speech'', to close-up in ''Freedom of Worship'', midrange in ''Freedom from Fear'', and wide angle in ''Freedom from Want''."<ref name=S19/>

In 1939, Rockwell moved to [[Arlington, Vermont]], which was an artist-friendly community that had hosted [[Robert Frost]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher]].<ref name=S19/> Of the move from [[New Rochelle, New York]], Rockwell said "I was restless&nbsp;... The town [of New Rochelle] seemed tinged with everything that happened to me". In New Rochelle, he had both endured a divorce and run with a fast crowd.<ref>Murray and McCabe, p. 12.</ref> Artists [[John Atherton]], [[Mead Schaeffer]] and George Hughes established residences in Arlington soon after Rockwell. The resident artists, Rockwell included, were mutually supportive and hired local citizens as their amateur models.<ref name=S19/> Using photography and Arlington residents as models, Rockwell was able to capture what he referred to as "human-looking humans" who were generally working-class people in an hour or so rather than hire professional models for the entire day.<ref>Schick, p. 20.</ref> Rockwell paid his models modestly. Rose Hoyt, who was engaged for a total of three photographic sessions for ''Freedom of Speech'' and ''Freedom of Worship'', earned $15 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15|1942|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for her sittings.<ref>Murray and McCabe, p. 48.</ref>

When the US entered the war in 1941, it had three agencies responsible for war [[propaganda]]: The Office of Facts and Figures (OFF), The Division of Information of the [[Office for Emergency Management|Office of Emergency Management]] (OEM), and Office of Government Reports (OGR).<ref name=HaK95/>  The OFF was responsible for commissioned artwork and for assembling a corps of writers, led by [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]].  By mid-1942, the Office of War Information determined that despite the efforts of OFF in distributing pamphlets, posters, displays and other media, only a third of the general public was familiar with Roosevelt's Four Freedoms and at most one in fifty could enumerate them.<ref name=HaK95/>  The Four Freedoms had been a "campaign to educate Americans about participation in World War II".<ref name=ERIC>{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED202064&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED202064|title=FDR's 'Four Freedoms' Campaign: The Rhetorical Contribution of Norman Rockwell's Posters|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[United States Department of Education]]|work=Education Resource Information Center}}</ref>

By 1942, Rockwell had been illustrating professionally for thirty years and was having a successful career.<ref>Murray and McCabe, p. 13.</ref> Additionally, by mid-1942 Rockwell's Gillis was becoming famous.<ref>Murray and McCabe, p. 15.</ref> Lorimer had been the editor of ''The Post'' from 1898 to 1936. He was followed by Wesley W. Stout for five years.<ref name=MaM22>Murray and McCabe, p. 22.</ref> In early 1942, Stout ran an article entitled "The Case Against the Jew", which led to advertising and subscription cancellations.<ref name=MaM73>Murray and McCabe, p. 73.</ref> ''The Post'' was rumored to be in trouble in financial 1942.<ref>Murray and McCabe, p. 18.</ref> Soon Stout was replaced by Hibbs who revamped the magazine.<ref name=MaM73/>

On May 24, 1942, Rockwell was seeking approval for a poster design at [[the Pentagon]] because the [[Artists Guild]] had designated that he advocate for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. [[Robert P. Patterson|Robert Patterson]], who was then United States Undersecretary of War, suggested revisions. On the same day, he visited with Thomas Mabry of the Graphic Division of the War Department's Office of Facts and Figures, which coordinated war-themed posters and [[billboard]]s. Mabry relayed the need for ''Four Freedoms'' artwork.<ref>Solomon, p. 201.</ref> Rockwell returned home pondering the Atlantic Charter, which had incorporated the Four Freedoms.<ref name=S202>Solomon, p. 202.</ref>

Rockwell remembered a scene of a local town meeting in which one person spoke out in lone dissent, but was given the floor, and was listened to respectfully, despite his solitary opposition. He was inspired to use this scene to illustrate ''[[Freedom of Speech (painting)|Freedom of Speech]]'', and Rockwell decided to use his [[Vermont]] neighbors as [[model (art)|models]] for an inspirational set of posters depicting the themes laid out by Roosevelt the previous year in a Four Freedoms series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org/page96|title=Norman Rockwell in the 1940s: A View of the American Homefront |publisher=[[Norman Rockwell Museum]]|accessdate=2008-04-12|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070720223914/http://www.nrm.org/page96 |archivedate = July 20, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  He spent three days making [[Charcoal (art)|charcoal]] sketches of the series,<ref name=HaK96>Hennessey and Knutson, p. 96.</ref> which some sources describe as color sketches.<ref name=MaM21>Murray and McCabe, p. 21.</ref> Rockwell's [[patriotic]] gesture was to travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] and volunteer his free services to the government for this cause.<ref name=MaM21/><ref name=AASfaWP/> In mid-June, accompanied by Schaeffer, he took four charcoal sketches to Washington, where they stayed at the [[Mayflower Hotel]], as the two sought commissions to design war art.<ref name=S202/> During the trip, Rockwell was asked by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] to continue his annual creation of a new painting for their annual calendar by publishing representative Orion Winford.<ref name=S202/> He was unable to hold Patterson's attention during their meeting,<ref name=S202/> so he met with the new [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] (OWI), where he was told  "The last war you illustrators did the posters. This war we're going to use fine artists men, real artists."<ref name=S203>Solomon, p. 203.</ref><ref name=M&M26>Murray and McCabe, p. 26.</ref>

On his return trip to Vermont with Schaeffer on June 16, they stopped in Philadelphia to meet with new ''Saturday Evening Post'' editor Ben Hibbs.<ref name=S204>Solomon, p. 204.</ref> Many accounts portray this visit as unplanned, but whether it was is unclear.<ref name=C305>Claridge, p. 305.</ref> Hibbs liked Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches,<ref name=HaK96/><ref name=AASfaWP/> and he gave Rockwell two months to complete the works.<ref name=S204/> A June 24 correspondence from ''The Post'' clarified that both Rockwell's and Schaeffer's series would be published.<ref name=C305/> By June 26, ''The Post'''s art editor James Yates notified Rockwell of plans for a layout of paintings with an accompanying essay or accompanying essays by President Roosevelt.<ref name=S204/>

Rockwell's summer was full of distractions. At one point a Manhattan gastroenterologist prescribed a surgery of uncertain nature, though it was not performed. He had commissions for other magazines, and business complications regarding second reproduction rights.<ref name=C307>Claridge, p. 307.</ref> He also had his Boy Scout commitment.<ref name=C308>Claridge, p. 308.</ref> Under time constraints, Rockwell made every excuse to avoid all other distracting assignments.<ref name=S205>Solomon, p. 205.</ref> In October, ''The Post'' sent its art editor to Arlington to check on Rockwell's progress.<ref name=MaM49>Murray and McCabe, p. 49.</ref> At about the same time, despite its Graphics Division chief's, Francis Brennan's outrage, the OWI began showing signs of renewed interest. In fact, after Rockwell was chosen the entire OWI Writers' Division resigned.<ref name=C306>Claridge, p. 306.</ref> The press release associated with the resignation asserted that the OWI was dominated by "high-pressure promoters who prefer slick salesmanship to honest information. These promoters would treat as stupid and reluctant customers the men and women of the United States."<ref name=MaM77/> There was further turmoil in the OWI from a faction supporting work by [[Ben Shahn]]; Shahn's work was not used in propaganda because it lacked general appeal.<ref name=HaK100>Hennessey and Knutson, p. 100.</ref> There were several artists who were commissioned to promote the war, including [[Jean Carlu]], [[Gerard Hordyke]], [[Hugo Ballin]] and [[Walter Westley Russell|Walter Russell]].<ref name=MaM42/> Russell created a [[Four Freedoms Monument]] that was eventually dedicated at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=e7FD0Qfub9MC&pg=PP71&dq=%22norman+rockwell%22+%22freedom+of+speech%22+%22four+freedoms%22+%22Saturday+Evening+Post%22#v=onepage&q=%22norman%20rockwell%22%20%22freedom%20of%20speech%22%20%22four%20freedoms%22%20%22Saturday%20Evening%20Post%22&f=false|title=Liberty's Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly|author=Inazu, John D.|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=0-300-17315-6|pages=|year=2012|accessdate=2014-03-04}}</ref>

Some sources published after Rockwell's death question whether the government was truly as discouraging as Rockwell claimed.  They cite an encouraging April 23, 1943 correspondence with Thomas D. Mabry of the OWI (a former Executive Director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]).<ref name=HaK96/>  At the time, the three government propaganda agencies were disjointed until they were unified under the OWI on June 13, 1942 by a [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential Executive Order]].<ref name=HaK96/> Furthermore, the writers division, led by MacLeish, was under pressure for failing to deliver a message intelligible to people of varying intelligence.

Upon completion, Rockwell's works were briefly exhibited at the West Arlington Grange before being delivered to ''The Post'' in Philadelphia.<ref name=MaM51>Murray and McCabe, p. 51.</ref> The series arrived in Philadelphia in January 1943.<ref name=MaM59>Murray and McCabe, p. 59.</ref> Roosevelt was shown the paintings in early February, and ''The Post'' sought Roosevelt's approval for the series of paintings and essays. Roosevelt responded with both a personal letter to Rockwell and an "official" letter of commendation to ''The Post'' dated February 10.<ref name=MaM60>Murray and McCabe, p. 60.</ref> Roosevelt instructed ''The Post'' to have the OWI have the essays translated into foreign languages so that they could be presented to leaders at the [[United Nations]].<ref name=MaM61/>

The Freedoms were published in a four part full-color, full-page editions, each accompanied by an essay of the same title. The panels were published in successive weeks to coincide with Roosevelt's speech;<ref name=MaM61/> ''Freedom of Speech'' (February 20), ''Freedom of Worship'' (February 27), ''Freedom from Want'' (March 6) and ''Freedom from Fear'' (March 13).

Rockwell noted that the series took an emotional toll on him, saying that the works were "serious paintings which sucked the energy right out of me like dredges, leaving me dazed and thoroughly weary."

== War Bond Drive ==

Between 1941 and 1946, the United States Department of the Treasury conducted eight War Loan Drives to promote the sale of war bonds to finance America's World War II efforts.  The government used several forms of solicitation, advertising and marketing, such as [[aircraft carrier]] exhibits. For the Seventh War Loan Drive, they used direct appeals from all five-star generals and admirals ([[George Marshall]], [[Dwight Eisenhower]], [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Jackson D. Arnold]], [[Ernest King]], [[Chester W. Nimitz]] and [[William D. Leahy]]),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775640,00.html|title=For a United People|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=1945-05-28|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|format=subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852208,00.html|title=Mission: Bond Sales|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=1945-05-21|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|format=subscription required}}</ref> and used a commemorative bond image of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in the Eighth War Loan Drive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775696,00.html|title=Just Deserts|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=1945-05-28|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|format=subscription required}}</ref>  The marketing attempts were quite varied even within a single War Loan Drive.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932136,00.html|title=The Carrot, the Stick|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=1943-10-04|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|format=subscription required}}</ref>

The War Bond Drives were viewed as key in boosting national morale by giving citizens the opportunity to support the war effort. They boosted patriotism and were a good marketing device for drumming up support.<ref name=MaM70>Murray and McCabe, p. 70.</ref> In fact, not only did celebrities help promote the bonds for free, but also, most air time and advertising space for the bonds was donated.<ref name=MaM71>Murray and McCabe, p. 71.</ref> The first War Loan Drive, known as "The Victory Loan Drive", began in early 1942.

== Critical review ==
Rockwell is considered the "quintessential middlebrow American artist".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDE1139F931A25754C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=4|title=The Candidates as Culture Vultures|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=1992-07-12|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Kelly, Michael}}</ref> As an artist he is an [[illustrator]] rather than a [[fine arts]] painter.  Although his style is [[painterly]], his work is produced for the purpose of mass reproduction, and it is produced with the intent of delivering a common message to its viewers via a detailed narrative style.<ref name=AAaA/><ref name=NRR/>  Furthermore, the vast majority of Rockwell's work was viewed in reproduced format and almost none of his contemporaneous audience ever saw his original work.<ref name=AAaA/><ref name=AV/>  Also, Rockwell's style of backwoods [[New England]] small-town [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]], known as [[Regionalism (art)|regionalism]], was sometimes viewed as out of step with the oncoming wave of [[abstract art|abstract]] [[modern art]].<ref name=NRR/><ref name=AitME>Dempsey, p. 165.</ref> Some say his realism is so direct that he abstains from using artistic license.<ref name=NRR/>  [[John Canaday]], a ''[[New York Times]]'' art critic once referred to Rockwell as the "Rembrandt of Punkin' Crick" for his aversion to the vices of big city life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=3&res=FB0615F8355A137B93C1AB1788D85F468785F9|title=Rockwell Retrospective in Brooklyn|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=1972-03-23|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Canaday, John | format=PDF, subscription required}}</ref> [[Dave Hickey]] derided Rockwell for painting without inflection.<ref name=NRR/>  Some critics also view his sentimental and nostalgic vision out of step with the harsh realities of American life, such as [[The Great Depression]].<ref name=AAaA>Wright, pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref> [[Deborah Solomon]] views the works as being "based on lofty civic principles", but rather than dealing with the warring patriots, they present themes with "civic and familial rituals" for "emblematic scenes".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/travel/norman-rockwells-new-england.html|title=Norman Rockwell's New England|accessdate=2014-01-05|date=2013-11-01|author=Solomon, Deborah|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

''Post'' editor Hibbs said that the ''Four Freedoms'' were an "inspiration&nbsp;... in the same way that the clock tower of old [[Independence Hall]], which I can see from my office window, inspires me."<ref name=MaM59/> Roosevelt wrote to Rockwell "I think you have done a superb job in bringing home to the plain, everyday citizen the plain, everyday truths behind the Four Freedoms&nbsp;... I congratulate you not alone on the execution but also for the spirit which impelled you to make this contribution to the common cause of a freer, happier world".<ref name=MaM60/> Roosevelt wrote to ''The Post'' "This is the first pictorial representation I have seen of the staunchly American values contained in the rights of free speech and free worship and our goals of freedom from fear and want."<ref name=MaM61>Murray and McCabe, p. 61.</ref> Roosevelt also wrote of the corresponding essays, "Their words should inspire all who read them with a deeper appreciation of the way of life we are striving to preserve."<ref name=MaM61/>

The ''Four Freedoms'' are perhaps Rockwell's most famous work.<ref name=HaK95>Hennessey and Knutson, p. 95.</ref> Some have said that Rockwell's ''Four Freedoms'' lack artistic maturity.  Others have pointed to the universality of the ''Freedom of Religion'' as disconcerting to practitioners of particular faiths.<ref name=ILTPP>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,766759,00.html|title=I Like To Please People|accessdate=2008-04-07|date=1943-06-21|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]|format=subscription required}}</ref>  Others complained that he [[idealism|idealized]] American life because by depicting wholesome, healthy, and happy sentiments Rockwell depicted the good that was remembered or wished for, but by avoiding misery, poverty, and social unrest, he failed to demonstrate command of the bad and the ugly parts of American life.<ref name=AAaA/> Rockwell's response to this criticism was, "I paint life as I would like it to be."<ref name=AAaA/> Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed.<ref name=C313/> Nonetheless, he was satisfied with the public acceptance of the series and that the series was able to serve such a patriotic purpose.<ref name=C314>Claridge, p. 314.</ref> Claridge feels he might have achieved his ambition if he had pursued the "quiet small scenes" he later became known for.<ref name=C313/>

Although all four images were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, ''Freedom from Want'', which depicts an elderly couple serving a fat turkey to what looks like a table of happy and eager children and grandchildren has given the idyllic Norman Rockwell [[Thanksgiving]] work as important a place in the enduring marketplace of promoting family togetherness, peace and plenty as [[Hallmark]] at Christmas.<ref name=ANRT/>  Some say that the Four Freedoms were unable to live up to the role of "illustrating grandiose concepts with humble correlatives" because they are too loud.<ref name=C313>Claridge, p. 313.</ref>

The commercial success of the series was in part because each painting is considered to be a model of understandable art by the general public.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779887,00.html?promoid=googlep|title=Docents' Duties|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=1948-06-28|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]|format=subscription required}}</ref> The success of Rockwell's depictions was due to his use of long-standing American cultural values about unity and respect of certain institutions while using symbols that enabled a broad audience to identify with his images.<ref name=ERIC/> This understandability made it one extreme on the scale of artistic complexity when comparing the series to contemporaneous art.  It was diametrically opposed to abstract art and far removed from the intrigue of [[surrealism]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775761,00.html|title=The U.S. & the United Nations|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=1945-06-04|publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[Time magazine]]|format=subscription required}}</ref>

In 1999, the [[High Museum of Art]] and the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]] produced the first comprehensive exhibition of Rockwell's career that started at the High Museum on November 6, 1999, stopped at the [[Chicago Historical Society]], [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], [[San Diego Museum of Art]], [[Phoenix Art Museum]], and  Norman Rockwell Museum before concluding at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] on February 11, 2002.<ref name=TW/><ref>Hennessey and Knutson, p. 4.</ref>  Although there has been a long history of Rockwell detractors, during this ''Norman Rockwell: Pictures for the American People'' touring exhibition attendance was record-setting and critical reviews were quite favorable.  The nostalgia seemed to cause a bit of revisionism in the art world, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' which said, "What's odd is the show's enthusiastic reception by the art world, which in a lather of revisionism is falling all over itself to embrace what it once reviled: the comfy, folksy narrative visions of a self-deprecating illustrator&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06EFDC1131F93BA15753C1A9679C8B63|title= Mirror, Mirror; Rockwell, Irony-Free|accessdate=2008-04-08|date=2001-10-28|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Green, Penelope}}</ref>

Some found Rockwell's presentation somewhat patronizing, but most were satisfied. ''The New Yorker'' remarked two years later: "They were received by the public with more enthusiasm, perhaps, than any other paintings in the history of American Art".<ref name=C313/> Claridge notes that the series is an example in which the sum is greater than its parts. She notes the inspiration comes in part from their cumulative "heft".<ref name=C313/>

== Provenance ==
Following the 1943<U+2013>44 War Bond Show, the ''Four Freedoms'' toured the country further by train in a specially-designed car. Through the 1950s the ''Four Freedoms'' hung in Hibbs' offices at ''The Post''.
