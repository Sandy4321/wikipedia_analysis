==Episcopacy==

===Bishop of Saint Cloud===
On July 6, 1987, Abbot Jerome was appointed the eighth Bishop of Saint Cloud by [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]].  He was consecrated on August 24, 1987 by Archbishop [[John Roach]] of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. Bishops [[John Joseph Sullivan (clergyman)|John Joseph Sullivan]] of Kansas City-Saint Joseph  and [[George Henry Speltz]] of Saint Cloud were the principal co-consecrators.<ref>http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bhanus.html</ref>  He served in Saint Cloud for seven years.

===Archbishop of Dubuque===
On August 23, 1994, Pope John Paull II appointed Bishop Hanus as the [[Coadjutor Archbishop]] of Dubuque.  Archbishop Hanus was welcomed on October 27, 1994.  He spent the next year becoming acquainted with the people and institutions that made up the Archdiocese.  After one year, Archbishop Kucera decided to retire.  When Kucera's request was approved by the [[Holy See]] on October 16, 1995, Hanus automatically succeeded him as 11th bishop and 9th archbishop of Dubuque. 

Archbishop Hanus implemented a strategic planning process throughout the archdiocese.  He spoke to the people of the diocese via videotaped messages played at Mass and gave the people a chance to respond and express their own views as regards the needs of the church.  As a result of this process he issued a vision statement, which spelled out his hopes and plans for the archdiocese.  These plans included an increased role for the laity in leadership roles throughout the archdiocese.<ref name>{{cite book|last= |first= |title=New Catholic Encyclopedia, Second Edition |volume=Vol. 4|year=2003|publisher=The Catholic University of America|location=Washington, DC|page=925}}</ref> This was necessitated by the [[priest shortage]] and changing demographics of the archdiocese.  Because of these realities, Hanus has had to combine and close a number of parishes.<ref>http://www.thonline.com/thseries/newsmakers/hanus/133459.htm</ref>  He also had to deal with the [[sexual abuse scandal in Dubuque archdiocese|sexual abuse]] crisis that has rocked the church in recent times. 

In the wake of a federal immigration raid at a meat processing plant in [[Postville, Iowa]], Archbishop Hanus called for comprehensive immigration reform.<ref>http://www.stwenceslauscr.com/textdocs/Archbishop_Hanus_INS.pdf</ref>  He also called on those who gathered at a prayer service to remember the scriptures "to treat the alien in your midst like your brother or sister, and that when you receive the alien, the foreigner, you are welcoming Christ."<ref>http://www.usccb.org/mrs/2009articles/helpgiven.pdf</ref>
