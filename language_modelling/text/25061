The '''''Ville de Paris''''' was a [[dirigible]] constructed in 1906 for [[Henry Deutsch de la Meurthe]] by [[<U+00C9>douard Surcouf]].

==Design==
''La Ville de Paris'' was the second airship of this name commissioned by Deutsch de la Meurthe: the first, built in 1902-3 and constructed by [[Maurice Mallet]] and designed by [[Victor Tatin]] <ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65534693/f58.image Le Tour du Monde A<U+00E9>rien],[[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] February 1903, p.48</ref> was unsuccesful.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200135.html "Ville de Paris'']  [[Flight International|''Flight'']] 6 March 1909, p. 137 </ref>

The airship was designed by the prominent [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]] manufacturer <U+00C9>douard Surcouf and [[Henri Kapferer]].  It was powered by a 70 hp 4-cylinder [[Argus Motoren|Argus]] engine driving a single propeller at the front of the nacelle via a 5:1 reduction gearbox. The engine also drove a pump to maintain pressure in the internal [[ballonet]].  The nacelle was a square-section wire-braced wooden structure which had been used in the unsuccessful design of 1902, and carried a pair of rudders at the rear and a pair of biplane [[elevator (aircraft)|elevators]].  The most novel feature of the design were the tail surfaces, which consisted of elongated tubes inflated with hydrogen. These were the result of research carried out by [[Charles Renard]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65512906/f23.image.

==Operational history==
After trim trials on 23 October 1906 and a tethered engine trial on 27 October, ''La Ville de Paris'' made its first flight on 11 November 1906, piloted by Surcouf and Kapferer, with [[Louis Paulhan]] as mechanic. The flight was marred by problems with the engine, and after crossing the [[Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Forest of Saint-Germain ]] the airship was landed at [[Chambourcy]] after 1&nbsp; 20&nbsp;m in the air, after which it was deflated and returned by road to Sartrouville.<ref name="A<U+00E9>rophileDec06">[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65512921/f8.image Le Dirigeable "La Ville de Paris" ] [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] December 1906, pp. 288-90</ref>

Following this flight it was decided to replace the four year old keel structure because of the state of the wood from which it was constructed.  A second pair of elevators were added amidships: these were constructed by [[Voisin Freres]], as was the propeller.  The Argus engine was replaced by a [[Chenu]] of the same power.

The reconstructed airship was inflated in June 1907 and after a series of tethered trials made its first free flight on 9 August, a short circuit returning to Sartrouville. Several similar successful short flights followed, on the seventh of which Deutsch de la Meurhe was carried as a passenger.  Subsequent flights carried several notable members of the French aviation community including [[Ferdinand Ferber]] and [[Ernest Archdeacon]] <ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551462k/f260.image Les Experiences du Dirigeable "Ville de Paris'' ] [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] September 1907, pp. 247-50</ref>

Having made 20 flights, it was then deflated and some modifications were made,  including the removal of one ballonet and  modifications to the control surfaces. Flights were resumed on 14 November, when a flight over central Paris was made. <ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551462k/f373.image] [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]], December 1907, p.364</ref>  Further flights over Paris, including a visit to the military flying field at [[Issy les Moulineax]] were made in November, including one carrying [[Charles Rolls]] and [[Frank Hedges Butler]] as passengers.

Deuthsch de la Meurthe then placed the airship at the disposal of the French Army, to replace the [[Lebaudy Patrie|Lebaudy ''Patrie'']] which had recently been torn from its mooring in a storm and lost, following which some flights were made carrying Army personnel in order to familiarise them with the airship.

A longer flight was made on 18 December, when it was flown from Sartrouville to [[Lagny]] and back  covering a distance of around {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} and another long flight was made on 24 December from Sartrouville to [[Coulommiers]] and back; the flight lasted 5 hours 10 minutes and covered {{convert|139|km|mi|abbr=on}}, setting a new French record for a closed-circuit flight. <ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6551462k/f375.image Le Dirigeable "Ville de Paris'' Militaris<U+00E9>] [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] December 1907 pp.363-5</ref> 

On 15 January 1908, as usual piloted by Kapferer with Paulhan as mechanic, it was flown from Sartrouville to the French Army establishment at [[Verdun]], a distance of {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The flight took 9hr 38 min, including 1 hr 25 min during which the airship had landed in order to make repairs to the engine. for repairs.  Two more flights were made at Verdun on before it was deflated at the end of January.<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6550620m/f58.image Le Nouvel Autoballoon Militaire Fran<U+00E7>ais] [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] 1 February 1908 pp.45-54</ref>

After delivery to the French army it was lengthened to {{convert|66|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, increasing its capacity to {{convert|3600|m3|ft3|abbr=on}}.  It its modified form it was first flown on 16 November 1908, when a trial flight was curtailed by the failure of a [[pinion]] in the reduction gearbox. The airship was brought down at the military maneuvering ground at Jardin-Fontaine {{convert|6|km|mi||abbr=on}} from its base and had to be walked back to the flying field at Verdun. Repairs were completed by 20 November, and after static engine trials it made seven short flights between 24 November and 2 December.  On 7 December it was deflated.

It was still in use in 1910, when several flights were made in August  during the military maneuvers in [[Picardy]], during one of which experiments were made with aerial photography.<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65639070/f406.image Le Dirigeable Militaire ''Ville de Paris''], [[l'A<U+00E9>rophile]] October 1910, p.471</ref>
