==Synopsis==
In the second book we see [[Septimus Heap (character)|Septimus]] as the apprentice to [[Marcia Overstrand|Marcia]], the ExtraOrdinary Wizard. When Simon Heap, the eldest Heap brother kidnaps [[Jenna Heap|Jenna]], Septimus goes out to search for her. He is assisted in his search by his friend Beetle. But Jenna runs away from Simon's observatory in The Badlands and makes her way towards The Port. Eventually Septimus is able to rescue Jenna with his elder brother [[Nicko Heap|Nicko]]'s help from the Port but they are tracked by Sleuth, Simon's tracking ball. 

They make their way to the Marram Marshes where they take the Dragon-Boat from Aunt Zelda's cottage and fly her to the Castle. But they meet Simon, flying in the sky. Simon drops a huge ''Thunderflash'' on the Dragon-Boat and it drops over Jannit Marten's Boatyard. Septimus, Jenna and Aunt Zelda are able to revive her through the ''Transubstantiate Triplet'' spell.

Septimus is also in search of the long lost ''Flyte'' charm. He finds the separated charm and unites it along with the small arrow ''Flyte'' charm that Marcia had given him as a token for his apprenticeship. Eventually he is able to fly and even warns Simon never to harm Jenna again. Also, the rock that Jenna gave him at Aunt Zelda's cottage turns out to be the egg of a dragon and eventually it hatches. Septimus absolutely adores the dragon and names him Spit Fyre. The dragon for some strange reason identifies Marcia as his mummy, much to Marcia's annoyance.

Septimus rescues Marcia by identifying the shadow that has been trailing her. He also finds out that the ''ShadowSafe'' Marcia is developing contains, unbeknownst to her, the bones of destroyed [[Necromancy|Necromancer]] DomDaniel, which, once reassembled, try to kill Marcia. With Septimus's help, Marcia is able to ''Identify'' him and he is once again destroyed.<ref>[http://irenewatson.typepad.com/readerviews/2008/11/septimus-heap-book-two-flyte.html Plot Summary for Flyte] Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>

As I predicted with Book One, I believe this series has the ability to be as popular as the Harry Potter series."<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://thebestreviews.com/review32124 Reviews for 'Flyte']</ref>

''Angela McQuay'' of Curledupkids.com gave a positive review saying "Flyte is just as delightful of a novel as its predecessor, filled with charms, magical beings, adventure and surprises. Both Septimus and Jenna are wonderful lead characters and should apply to young readers both male and female alike." <ref>Angela Mcquay[http://www.curledupkids.com/sh2flyte.htm Flyte: Septimus Heap book two] ''Curledupkids.com'' Retrieved on 2008-12-22</ref>

''John McLay'' of Reviewscout.com was also impressed and said "This satisfying second volume, again stuffed with mayhem and thrilling adventure, confirms the immense readability of Sage<U+2019>s novels and consolidates the reputation for her growing sequence of funny fantasy novels that should mean they remain popular with young readers for many years to come." <ref>[http://www.reviewscout.com/0747584494 Flyte (Septimus Heap)] Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>

''VOYA'' and ''Booklist'' both gave extremely positive reviews saying "Terrifically entertaining....Fans of the first book will be delighted with this sequel to Septimus's story.(VOYA)" and "Purists will scowl, but many readers, won over by [[Angie Sage|Sage]]'s confiding, whimsical tone and tightly interlocking plot elements, will welcome [[Septimus Heap]] as their second-favorite wizard." <ref>[http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?isbn=9780060577360&atch=h&ymal=pp Powell's.com review of Flyte]Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>

''Iris Irine'' of Booksonboard.com praised the books saying "Although the plot had taken a darker turn, somehow Angie Sage still managed to keep it interesting and suitable for all ages. Septimus and the others must face their own emotions and realize that indeed, things could go wrong. Deeper intrigues are being revealed such as Simon's betrayal and the Dragon Boat's critical condition. Overall, the book is excellent."<ref>[https://www.booksonboard.com/index.php?BODY=viewbook&BOOK=254390&v=ratings BooksonBoard.com review of Flyte]Retrieved on 2009-01-13 </ref>

A review in Weread.com was also positive. The reviewer said "She did it again. Yet another funny and delightful story of the, somewhat strange, Heap family. The story is actually deeper and more inovative than the first one.

The book faced a little criticism with [[Angie Sage]]'s bolding of the magical words. The reviewer in ''Epinions.com'' gave a mixed review and said "Flyte was good enough to make me want to read the third one, [[Physik]] when it comes out in April 2007, but not good enough for me to like it as much as I did the first book, [[Magyk]]. I<U+2019>m starting to think that any second book in a series such as this is going to suffer the same issues: the characters and fabricated world are no longer new and exciting, so there<U+2019>s more focus on the story and the character development. While the characters did develop here, the plot felt kind of haphazard, with a very un-climactic climax."<ref>[http://www99.epinions.com/review/Flyte_no_author_listed/content_246297104004 My Mindless Meanderings: A review for ''Flyte'']Retrieved on 2009-01-13</ref>
