'''Micka Brennan''' was an [[Irish Free State|Irish]] sportsperson.  He played [[hurling]] with his local club [[Sarsfield's GAA (Cork)|Sarsfield<U+2019>s]] and with the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] senior inter-county team from 1931 until 1943.

==Early life==

Micka Brennan was born in [[Riverstown]], [[County Cork]].  He was educated locally at Riverstown [[national school]] where he made his [[hurling]] debut.  He later attended the North Monastery school in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], a virtual hurling academy for young players, where he enjoyed more success.

==Playing career==

===Club===

Brennan played his club [[hurling]] with his local [[Sarsfield's GAA (Cork)|Sarsfield<U+2019>s]] club and enjoyed some success.  He won a minor county title in [[1931]], however, it would be [[1951]] before Brennan won a much sought-after senior [[Cork Senior Hurling Championship|county medal]] with Sar<U+2019>s.  It was the club<U+2019>s first senior success.  In an unprecedented display of sportsmanship the defeated [[Glen Rovers GAA|Glen Rovers]] players chaired Brennan off the field.  In [[1957]] when Sarsfield<U+2019>s won a second county title Brennan was chairman of the club and was heavily involved in coaching the team

===Inter-county===

Brennan first came to prominence on the [[Cork GAA|Cork]] senior inter-county team in the early 1930s.  Unfortunately, it was a lean time for the Cork team.  In [[1939]] Brennan<U+2019>s long wait for success ended when he won his first [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] title.  The subsequent All-Ireland final against [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] has gone down in history as the <U+2018>thunder and lightning<U+2019> final as the climax of the game was played in a tremendous downpour.  Brennan, however, ended up on the losing side as victory went to Kilkenny on that occasion.  The following year Cork surrendered their provincial crown, however, Brennan captured a [[National Hurling League]] medal.  He added a second league medal to his collection in [[1941]], however, that year the All-Ireland Championship was severely hampered due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] and [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]].  As a result of this Cork were declared the Munster champions after defeating [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] and automatically qualified to play [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] in the All-Ireland final.  The game turned into a rout as Cork beat <U+2018>the Dubs<U+2019> by twenty points and Brennan collected his first [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal.  In the delayed Munster final, however, [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] defeated Cork.  Brennan played no part in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship 1942|1942 championship]], however, he returned in [[1943]] to capture a second Munster medal.  He later added a second All-Ireland medal to his collection following Cork<U+2019>s huge defeat of [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the final.  In [[1944]] Brennan was a sub when Cork retained their provincial and All-Ireland titles.  Brennan retired from hurling shortly afterwards, however, he was recalled for a tournament game against [[Laois GAA|Laois]] in 1951 and scored six goals in the process.

Brennan<U+2019>s other honours include [[Railway Cup]] honours with [[Munster GAA|Munster]] in [[1937]], [[1939]] and [[1940]].
