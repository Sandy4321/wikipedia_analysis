'''Fish''' are [[marine biology|aquatic]] [[vertebrate]]s that are  [[cold-blooded]], covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]] and equipped with two sets of paired [[fin]]s and several unpaired fins. Fish are abundant in the sea and in fresh water, with species being known from mountain streams (e.g., [[Salvelinus|char]] and [[gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]]) as well as in the deepest depths of the ocean (e.g., [[gulper]]s and [[anglerfish]]). They are of tremendous importance as [[fish (food)|food]] for people around the world, either collected from the wild (see [[fishing]]) or farmed in much the same way as cattle or chickens (see [[aquaculture]]). Fish are also exploited for recreation, through [[angling]] and [[fishkeeping]], and fish are commonly exhibited in public [[aquarium|aquaria]]. Fish have an important role in many cultures through the ages, ranging as widely as deities and religious symbols to subjects of books and popular movies.

==Definition==

The term "fish" is most precisely used to describe any non-[[tetrapod]] [[chordate]], i.e., an animal with a backbone that has [[gill]]s throughout life and has limbs, if any, in the shape of fins.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Fishes of the World]]|last=Nelson|first=Joseph S.|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]], Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0471250317|pages=2}}</ref> Unlike groupings such as [[bird]]s or [[mammal]]s, fish are not a single [[clade]] but a [[paraphyletic]] collection of [[taxon|taxa]], including [[hagfish]]es, [[lamprey]]s, [[Chondrichthyes|sharks and rays]], [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fishes]], [[Actinistia|coelacanths]], and [[Dipnoi|lungfishes]].<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 3, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref><ref name="treeoflife">Tree of life web project - [http://tolweb.org/Chordata/2499 Chordates].</ref>

A typical fish is [[cold-blooded]]; has a [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamlined]] body that allows it to swim rapidly; extracts oxygen from the water using gills or an accessory breathing organ to enable it to breath atmospheric oxygen; has two sets of paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin; has jaws; has skin that is usually covered with [[scale (zoology)|scales]]; and lays eggs that are fertilized internally or externally.  

[[Image:leafydragon.jpg|thumb|200px|Fish come in many shapes and sizes. This is a [[Leafy sea dragon|sea dragon]], a close relative of the [[seahorse]]. Their leaf-like appendages enable them to blend in with floating seaweed]]

To each of these there are exceptions. [[Tuna]], [[Swordfish]], and some species of [[shark]]s show [[Warm-blooded#Temperature control in cold-blooded animals|some warm-blooded adaptations]], and are able to raise their body temperature significantly above that of the ambient water surrounding them.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 83-86, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> Streamlining and swimming performance varies from highly streamlined and rapid swimmers which are able to reach 10-20 body-lengths per second (such as tuna, salmon, and [[Carangidae|jacks]]) through to slow but more maneuverable species such as [[eel]]s and [[Batoidea|rays]] that reach no more than 0.5 body-lengths per second.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 103, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> Many groups of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air as well as from the water using a variety of different structures. [[Lungfish]] have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods, [[gourami]]s have a structure called the [[labyrinth organ]] that performs a similar function, while many catfish, such as ''[[Corydoras]]'' extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 53-57, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> Body shape and the arrangement of the fins is highly variable, covering such seemingly un-fishlike forms as [[seahorse]]s, [[pufferfish]], [[anglerfish]], and [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulpers]]. Similarly, the surface of the skin may be naked (as in [[moray eel]]s), or covered with scales of a variety of different types usually defined as [[Placoid scale|placoid]] (typical of sharks and rays), [[Scale (zoology)#Cosmoid scales|cosmoid]] (fossil lungfishes and coelacanths), [[ganoid]] (various fossil fishes but also living [[gar]]s and [[bichir]]s, [[cycloid]], and [[ctenoid]] (these last two are found on most [[bony fish]].<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 33-36, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> There are even fishes that spend most of their time out of water. [[Mudskippers]] feed and interact with one another on mudflats and are only underwater when hiding in their burrows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://64.95.130.5/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=12803|title=Species Summary: ''Periophthalmus barbarus''|author=Froese, R. and D.

Fish range in size from the 16 m (51 ft) [[whale shark]] to the 8 mm (just over <U+00BC> of an inch) long [[stout infantfish]].

Many types of [[aquatic animal]]s commonly referred to as "fish" are not fish in the sense given above; see [[Fish (disambiguation)]].

==Classification==
Fish are a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group: that is, any [[clade]] containing all fish also contains the [[tetrapod]]s, which are not fish. For this reason, groups such as the "Class Pisces" seen in older reference works are no longer used in formal classifications.

Fish are classified into the following major groups:

* Subclass [[Pteraspidomorphi]] (early jawless fish)
* Class [[Thelodonti]]
* Class [[Anaspida]]
* (unranked) [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] (early jawless fish)
** (unranked) [[Hyperoartia]]
*** [[Petromyzontidae]] ([[lamprey]]s)
** Class [[Galeaspida]]
** Class [[Pituriaspida]]
** Class [[Osteostraci]]
* Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]] (jawed vertebrates)
** Class [[Placodermi]] (armoured fishes, extinct)
** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish)
** Class [[Acanthodii]] (spiny sharks, extinct)
** Superclass [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish)
*** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned fish)
*** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish)
**** Subclass [[Coelacanthimorpha]] ([[coelacanth]]s)
**** Subclass [[Dipnoi]] ([[lungfish]])

Some palaeontologists consider that [[Conodonta]] are [[chordate]]s, and so regard them as primitive fish. For a fuller treatment of classification, see the [[vertebrate]] article.

The various fish groups taken together account for more than half of the known vertebrates. There are almost 28,000 known [[extant taxon|extant]] species of fish, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with the remainder being about 970 [[Chondrichthyes|sharks, rays, and chimeras]] and about 108 hagfishes and lampreys.<ref>Nelson, J. S.: Fishes of the World, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p 4-5, 2006 ISBN 0471250317</ref> A third of all of these species are contained within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are [[Cyprinidae]], [[Gobiidae]], [[Cichlidae]], [[Characidae]], [[Loricariidae]], [[Balitoridae]], [[Serranidae]], [[Labridae]], and [[Scorpaenidae]]. On the other hand, about 64 families are [[monotypic]], containing only one species. It is predicted that the eventual number of total extant species will be at least 32,500.<ref>Nelson, J. S.: Fishes of the World, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p 3, 2006 ISBN 0471250317</ref>

==Anatomy==
{{main|Fish anatomy}}
[[Image:Lampanyctodes hectoris (Hector's lanternfish)2.png|thumb|left|350px|The anatomy of ''Lampanyctodes hectoris'' <br><small>

=== Digestive system ===
The advent of jaws allowed fish to eat a much wider variety of food, including plants and other organisms. In fish, food is ingested through the mouth and then broken down in the [[esophagus]]. When it enters the stomach, the food is further broken down and, in many fish, further processed in fingerlike pouches called [[pyloric caeca]]. The pyloric caeca secrete digestive [[enzymes]] and absorb nutrients from the digested food. Organs such as the [[liver]] and [[pancreas]] add enzymes and various digestive chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.

=== Respiratory system ===
Most fish exchange gases by using [[gill]]s that are located on either side of the [[pharynx]]. Gills are made up of threadlike structures called [[filament]]s. Each filament contains a network of [[capillary|capillaries]] that allow a large [[surface area]] for the exchange of [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gill filaments. The blood in the capillaries flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing [[Counter-current exchange|counter current exchange]]. They then push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fishes, like [[shark]]s and [[lamprey]]s, possess multiple gill openings. However, most fishes have a single gill opening on each side of the body. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an [[operculum]].

Juvenile [[bichir]]s have external gills, a very primitive feature that they hold in common with larval [[amphibian]]s.

[[Image:Swim bladder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Swim bladder of a Rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus)]]
Many fish can breathe air. The mechanisms for doing so are varied. The skin of anguillid eels may be used to absorb oxygen. The buccal cavity of the [[electric eel]] may be used to breathe air. Catfishes of the families [[Loricariidae]], [[Callichthyidae]], and [[Scoloplacidae]] are able to absorb air through their digestive tracts.<ref name="Armbruster1998">{{cite journal|url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/science_math/res_area/loricariid/fish_key/Air.pdf|title=Modifications of the Digestive Tract for Holding Air in Loricariid and Scoloplacid Catfishes|journal=[[Copeia]]|year=1998|issue=3|pages=663-675|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref> [[Lungfish]] and [[bichir]]s have paired lungs similar to those of [[tetrapod]]s and must rise to the surface of the water to gulp fresh air in through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. [[Gar]] and [[bowfin]] have a vascularised swim bladder that is used in the same way. [[Loach]]es, [[Erythrinidae|trahiras]], and many [[catfish]] breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to what frogs do). A number of fishes have evolved so-called '''accessory breathing organs''' that are used to extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as [[gourami]]s and [[betta]]s) have a [[labyrinth (organ)|labyrinth organ]] above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures more or less resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably [[Channidae|snakeheads]], [[Luciocephalidae|pikeheads]], and the [[Clariidae]] family of catfish.

Being able to breathe air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the oxygen concentration in the water may decline at certain times of the year. At such times, fishes dependent solely on the oxygen in the water, such as perch and cichlids, will quickly suffocate, but air-breathing fish can survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some of these air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks after the water has otherwise completely dried up, entering a state of [[aestivation]] until the water returns.

[[Image:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Tuna gills inside of the head. The fish head is oriented snout-downwards, with the view looking towards the mouth.]]
Fish can be divided into '''obligate air breathers''' and '''facultative air breathers'''. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, ''must'' breathe air periodically or they will suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish ''Hypostomus plecostomus'', will only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely solely on their gills for oxygen if conditions are favourable. Most fish are not obligate air breathers as there is an energetic cost in rising to the surface and a fitness cost of being exposed to predators.<ref name="Armbruster1998"/>

=== Circulatory system ===
Fish have a [[circulatory system|closed circulatory system]] with a [[heart]] that pumps the [[blood]] in a single loop throughout the body. The blood goes from the heart to gills, from the gills to the rest of the body, and then back to the heart. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts: the [[sinus venosus]], the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]], the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], and the [[bulbus arteriosus]]. Despite consisting of four parts, the fish heart is still a two-chambered heart. <ref name="Setaro>{{Citation | last =Setaro | first =John F. | year =1999 | title =Circulatory System | publisher =Microsoft Encarta 99}}</ref> The sinus venosus is a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's [[vein]]s before allowing it to flow to the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way compartment for blood to flow into the ventricle. The ventricle is a thick-walled, muscular chamber and it does the actual pumping for the heart. It pumps blood to a large tube called the bulbus arteriosus. At the front end, the bulbus arteriosus connects to a large blood vessel called the aorta, through which blood flows to the fish's gills.

=== Excretory system===
As with many aquatic animals, most fish release their nitrogenous wastes as [[ammonia]]. Some of the wastes [[diffusion|diffuse]] through the gills into the surrounding water. Others are removed by the [[kidney]]s, excretory organs that [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] wastes from the blood. Kidneys help fishes control the amount of ammonia in their bodies. Saltwater fish tend to lose water because of [[osmosis]]. In saltwater fish, the kidneys concentrate wastes and return as much water as possible back to the body. The reverse happens in [[freshwater fish]], they tend to gain water continuously. The kidneys of freshwater fish are specially adapted to pump out large amounts of dilute urine. Some fish have specially adapted kidneys that change their function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.

=== Sensory and nervous system ===
[[Image:Fish brain.png|thumb|150px|Dorsal view of the brain of the [[rainbow trout]].]]
====Central nervous system====
Fish typically have quite small [[brain]]s relative to body size when compared with other vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the mass of the brain from a similarly sized bird or mammal.<ref name="Helfman_brain">Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 48-49, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> However, some fishes have relatively large brains, most notably [[Mormyridae|mormyrids]] and [[shark]]s, which have brains of about as massive relative to body weight as [[bird]]s and [[marsupial]]s.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 191, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref>

The brain is divided into several regions. At the front are the [[olfactory bulb|olfactory lobe]]s, a pair of structure the receive and process signals from the [[nostril]]s via the two [[olfactory nerve]]s.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> The olfactory lobes are very large in fishes that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed [[telencephalon]], the equivalent structure to the [[cerebrum]] in higher vertebrates. In fishes the telencephalon is concerned mostly with [[olfaction]].<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> Together these structures form the '''forebrain'''.

Connecting the forebrain to the ''midbrain'' is the [[diencephalon]] (in the adjacent diagram, this structure is below the optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs a number of functions associated with [[hormone]]s and [[homeostasis]].<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> The [[pineal body]] lies just above the diencephalon. This structure performs many different functions including detecting light, maintaining [[circadian]] rhythms, and controlling colour changes.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/>

The [[midbrain]] or mesencephalon contains the two [[optic lobe]]s. These are very large in species that hunt by sight, such as [[rainbow trout]] and [[cichlid]]s.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/>

The '''hindbrain''' or [[metencephalon]] is particularly involved in swimming and balance.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is usually very large, typically the biggest part of the brain.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> Hagfish and [[lamprey]]s have relatively small cerebellums, but at the other extreme the cerebellums of [[mormyrid]]s are massively developed and apparently involved in their [[electric fish|electrical sense]].<ref name="Helfman_brain"/>

The '''brain stem''' or [[myelencephalon]] is the most posterior part of the brain.<ref name="Helfman_brain"/> As well as controlling the functions of some of the muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least the brain stem is also concerned with [[respiration]] and [[osmoregulation]].<ref name="Helfman_brain"/>

====Sense organs====
Most fish possess highly developed sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have well-developed eyes that have color vision that is at least as good as a human's. Many fish also have specialized cells known as chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears in their heads, many fish may not hear sounds very well. However, most fishes have sensitive receptors that form the [[lateral line system]]. The lateral line system allows for many fish to detect gentle currents and vibrations, as well as to sense the motion of other nearby fish and prey. <ref name="Encarta 99">{{Citation | last =Orr | first =James | year =1999 | title =Fish | publisher =Microsoft Encarta 99}}</ref> Some fishes such as catfishes and sharks, have organs that detect low levels electric current.<ref>Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. Pp. 431-472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press.</ref> Other fish, like the electric eel, can produce their own electricity.

====Pain reception in fish====
In 2003, it was concluded by Scottish [[scientist]]s at the [[University of Edinburgh]] performing research on rainbow trout that fish exhibit behaviors often associated with [[pain]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2983045.stm Fish do feel pain, scientists say]
</ref> Professor James D. Rose of the [[University of Wyoming]] found flaws in the study and published a critique of it.<ref>[http://uwadmnweb.uwyo.edu/Zoology/faculty/Rose/Critique%20of%20Sneddon%20article.pdf Rose, J.D. 2003. A Critique of the paper: "Do fish have nociceptors: Evidence for the evolution of a vertebrate sensory system"]</</ref> Rose had published his own study a year earlier concluding that fish cannot feel pain as they lack the appropriate [[neocortex]] of the brain.<ref>James D. Rose, [http://www.g-feuerstein.com/Presse/fishpain.htm Do Fish Feel Pain?], 2002. Retrieved September 27, 2007.</ref> Other researchers have suggested that the question of pain in fish may be diffcult to answer since fish "pain" might be felt differently than human "pain."<ref>[http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-09/970091001.Zo.r.html RE: Do fish and shellfish have pain receptors?]</ref>

===Muscular system===
{{main|Fish locomotion}}
Most fish move by contracting paired sets of muscles on either side of the backbone alternately. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body of the fish. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is created. This backward force, in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins are used like an airplane's stabilizers. Fins also increase the surface area of the tail, allowing for an extra boost in speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction as they move through water. Since body tissue is more dense than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fishes have an internal organ called a [[swim bladder]] that adjust their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.

=== Reproductive system ===
{{See|Spawning}}
====Organs====
Fish reproductive organs include [[testicle|testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most fish species, gonads are paired organs of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.<ref name="Guimaraes"/> There may also be a range of secondary reproductive organs that help in increasing a fish's fitness.

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of teleosts testes has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubules, while in Atherinomorph fishes they are confined to the distal portion of these structures. Fishes can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the phase of release of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules lumen.<ref name="Guimaraes">{{cite journal|last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J.|coauthors=Santos, Jos<U+00E9> E. dos; Santos, Gilmar B.|title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbr<U+00FC>cker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes)|journal=Rev. Bras. Zool.|date=July/Sept. 2005|volume=22|issue=3|pages=556-564|id=ISSN 0101-8175}}</ref>

Fish ovaries may be of two types: [[gymnovarian]] or [[cystovarian]]. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then eliminated. In the second type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]]. <ref name="Brito">{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0102-09352003000500018|title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the S<U+00E3>o Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil|last=Brito|first=M.F.G.|coauthors=Bazzoli, N.|journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterin<U+00E1>ria e Zootecnia|volume=55|issue=5|year=2003|id=ISSN: 0102-0935}}</ref> Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfishes, sturgeons, and bowfins. Cystovaries are the condition that characterizes most of the teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.<ref name="Guimaraes"/>

Oogonia development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization processes. Changes in the nucleus, ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.<ref name="Guimaraes"/>

Postovulatory follicles are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabosrbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.<ref name="Guimaraes"/>

Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, either having testes and ovaries at different phases in the life cycle. However, there are even some fish, such as [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], that are simultaneously male and female.

====Reproductive method====
Over 97% of all known fishes are [[oviparous]],<ref name="Scott">Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. ISBN 1-5646-5193-2</ref> that is, the eggs develop outside the mother's body. Examples of oviparous fishes include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]], and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water. However, a few oviparous fishes practise internal fertilisation, with the male using some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female, most notably the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[claspers]].

The newly-hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[larva]]e.  They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (from which they gain their nutrition) and are very different in appearance to juvenile and adult specimens of their species.  The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short however (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to resemble juveniles of their species.  During this transition larvae use up their yolk sac and must switch from yolk sac nutrition to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which is dependent on zooplankton prey densities and causes many mortalities in larvae.

[[Ovoviviparous]] fish are ones in which the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilization but receive little or no [[nutrition]] from the mother, depending instead on the [[yolk]]. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fishes include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

Some species of fish are [[viviparous]]. In such species the mother retains the eggs, as in ovoviviparous fishes, but the embryos receive nutrition from the mother in a variety of different ways. Typically, viviparous fishes have a structure analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placental mammals|mammals]] connecting the mother's blood supply with the that of the embryo. Examples of viviparous fishes of this type include the [[Embiotocidae|surf-perches]], [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], and [[lemon shark]]. The embryos of some viviparous fishes exhibit a behaviour known as [[oophagy]] where the developing embryos eat eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the [[halfbeak]] ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.<ref name="Meisner">Meisner, A & Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae). Journal of Morphology 234, pp 295-317, 1997</ref> [[Intrauterine cannibalism]] is an even more unusual mode of vivipary, where the largest embryos in the uterus will eat their weaker and smaller siblings. This behaviour is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.<ref name="Meisner">Meisner, A & Burns, J: Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae). Journal of Morphology 234, pp 295-317, 1997</ref>

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fishes as [[livebearers]].

===Immune system===
Types of immune organs vary between different types of fish.<ref>A.G. Zapata, A. Chiba and A. Vara. ''Cells and tissues of the immune system of fish.'' In: The Fish Immune System: Organism, Pathogen and Environment. Fish Immunology Series. (eds. G. Iwama and T.Nakanishi,), New York, Academic Press, 1996, pages 1-55.</ref> 
In the [[jawless fish]] (lampreys and hagfishes), true lymphoid organs are absent. Instead, these fish rely on regions of [[lymphoid tissue]] within other organs to produce their immune cells. For example, [[erythrocytes]], [[macrophages]] and [[plasma cells]] are produced in the anterior kidney (or [[pronephros]]) and some areas of the gut (where [[granulocytes]] mature) resemble primitive [[bone marrow]] in hagfish.  
[[Cartilaginous fish]] (sharks and rays) have a more advanced immune system than the jawless fish. They have three specialized organs that are unique to chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to bone marrow of mammals) that surround the gonads, the Leydig<U+2019>s organ within the walls of their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. All these organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells).  They also possess an identifiable [[thymus]] and a well-developed [[spleen]] (their most important immune organ) where various [[lymphocytes]], plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored. 
[[Chondrostean]] fish (sturgeons, paddlefish and birchirs) possess a major site for the production of granulocytes within a mass that is associated with the [[meninges]] (membranes surrounding the central nervous system) and their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocytes, [[reticular cells]] and a small number of macrophages. The chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ; where erythrocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages develop. 
Like chondrostean fish, the major immune tissues of bony fish (or [[teleostei]]) include the kidney (especially the anterior kidney), where many different immune cells are housed.<ref>D.P. Anderson. ''Fish Immunology''. (S.F. Snieszko and H.R. Axelrod, eds), Hong Kong: TFH Publications, Inc. Ltd., 1977.</ref> In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads).  Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus.<ref>S. Chilmonczyk. ''The thymus in fish: development and possible function in the immune response''. Annual Review of Fish Diseases, Volume 2, 1992, pages 181-200.</ref><ref>J.D. Hansen and A.G. Zapata. ''Lymphocyte development in fish and amphibians''. Immunological Reviews, Volume 166, 1998, pages 199-220.</ref> Recently, a lymphatic system similar to that described in mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish.  Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated)  [[T cells]] will accumulate while waiting to encounter an [[antigen]].<ref>Kucher et al.,. ''Development of the zebrafish lymphatic system requires VegFc signalling''. Current Biology, Volume 16, 2006, pages 1244-1248. </ref>

==Evolution==
The early fossil record on fish is not very clear. It appears it was not a successful enough animal early in its evolution to leave many fossils. However, this would eventually change over time as it became a dominant form of sea life and eventually branching to include land [[vertebrates]] such as [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], and [[mammals]]. 

The formation of the hinged jaw appears to be what resulted in the later proliferation of fish because un-jawed fish left very few ancestors.<ref>[http://io.uwinnipeg.ca/~simmons/1116/chordate.htm Classification of the Chordates] EVOLUTION, ECOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY 05-1116-3, University of Winnipeg. Retrieved [[2007-04-07]].</ref> [[Lamprey]]s may be a rough representative of pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in [[Placodermi]] fossils. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, respiratory-related, or a combination.

Some speculate that fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a coral-like [[Sea squirt]], whose larvae resemble primitive fish in some key ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today, see [[Neoteny]]), although the reversal of this case is also possible. Candidates for early fish include [[Agnatha]] such as [[Haikouichthys]], [[Myllokunmingia]], [[Pikaia]], and [[Conodonts]].

==Homeothermy==
[[Image:Whiteshark-TGoss5b hf.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A 3 to 4&nbsp;m [[great white shark]] off [[Guadalupe Island|Isla Guadalupe]]]]
Although most fish are exclusively aquatic and cold-blooded, there are exceptions to both cases. Fish from a number of different groups have evolved the capacity to live out of the water for extended periods of time. Of these [[amphibious fish]] some such as the [[mudskipper]] can live and move about on land for up to several days. Also, certain species of fish maintain elevated body temperatures to varying degrees. Endothermic [[teleost]]s (bony fishes) are all in the suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of "primitive" mackerel (''Gasterochisma melampus''). All sharks in the family [[Lamnidae]] &ndash; shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark &ndash; are known to have the capacity for endothermy, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family [[Alopiidae]] (thresher sharks).  The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to [[bluefin tuna]] and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] above ambient water temperatures. ''See also [[gigantothermy]]''. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased contractile force of muscles, higher rates of central [[nervous system]] processing, and higher rates of [[digestion]].

==Diseases==
Like other animals, fish can suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites. To prevent disease they have a variety of '''non-specific defences''' and '''specific defences'''. Non-specific defences include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the [[epidermis]] that traps [[microorganisms]] and inhibits their growth. Should [[pathogen]]s breach these defences, fish can develop an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]] that increases the flow of blood to the infected region and delivers the [[white blood cells]] that will attempt to destroy the pathogens. Specific defences are specialised responses to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, in other words, an [[immune response]].<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 95-96, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> In recent years, [[vaccines]] have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example the vaccines for [[furunculosis]] in farmed [[salmon]] and [[koi herpes virus]] in [[koi]].<ref>R. C. Cipriano (2001), Furunculosis And Other Diseases Caused By ''Aeromonas salmonicida''. Fish Disease Leaflet 66. U.S. Department of the Interior.[http://www.lsc.usgs.gov/FHB/leaflets/FHB66.pdf]</ref><ref>K H Hartman et al (2004), Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) Disease. Fact Sheet VM-149. University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.[http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/VM/VM11300.pdf]</ref>

Some fish will also take advantage of [[cleaner fish]] for removal of external parasites. The best known of these are the [[cleaner wrasse]]s of the genus ''Labroides'' found on coral reefs in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. These small fish maintain so-called "cleaning stations" where other fish, known as hosts, will congregate and perform specific movements to attract the attention of the cleaner fish.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 380, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> Cleaning behaviours have been observed in a number of other fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, ''Etroplus maculatus'', the cleaner fish, and the much larger ''Etroplus suratensis'', the host.<ref>Richard L. Wyman and Jack A. Ward (1972). A Cleaning Symbiosis between the Cichlid Fishes Etroplus maculatus and Etroplus suratensis. I. Description and Possible Evolution.

==Conservation==
[[Image:Whale shark Georgia aquarium.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A [[Whale shark]], the world's largest fish, is classified as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]].]]
As of 2006, the [[IUCN]] [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] describes 1,173 species of fish as being threatened with extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1|title=Table 1: Numbers of threatened species by major groups of organisms (1996<U+2013>2004)|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> Included on this list are species such as [[Gadus morhua|Atlantic cod]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/8784/summ|title=Gadus morhua|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> [[Cyprinodon diabolis|Devil's Hole pupfish]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/6149/summ|title=Cyprinodon diabolis|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> [[coelacanth]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/11375/summ|title=Latimeria chalumnae|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> and [[great white shark]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/3855/summ|title=Carcharodon carcharias|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> Because fish live underwater they are much more difficult to study than terrestrial animals and plants, and information about fish populations is often lacking. However, freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small areas.  For example, the [[Devil's Hole pupfish]] occupies only a single 3&nbsp;m by 6&nbsp;m pool.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp. 449-450, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref>

===Overfishing===
In the case of edible fishes such as cod and [[tuna]] a major threat is overfishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/6234881.stm|title=Call to halt cod 'over-fishing'|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6301187.stm|title=Tuna groups tackle overfishing|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> Where overfishing persists, it eventually causes the collapse of the fish population (known as a "stock") because the population can't breed fast enough to replace the individuals removed by fishing. One well-studied example of the collapse of a fishery is the [[Pacific sardine]] ''Sadinops sagax caerulues'' fishery off the coast of California. From a peak in 1937 of 790,000 [[tonnes]] the amount of fish landed steadily declined to a mere 24,000 tonnes in 1968, at which point the fishery stopped as no longer economically viable. Such '''commercial extinction''' does not mean that the fish itself goes extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a profitable fishery.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 462, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> The main tension between fisheries science and the fishing industry is the need to balance conservation with preserving the livelihoods of fishermen. In places such as [[Scotland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], and [[Alaska]] the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments have a vested interest in finding a balance between conserving fish stocks while maintaining an economic level of commercial fishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6112352.stm|title=UK 'must shield fishing industry'|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6197433.stm|title=EU fish quota deal hammered out|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> On the other hand, scientists and conservations push for increasingly stringent protection for fish stocks, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news81778444.html|title=Ocean study predicts the collapse of all seafood fisheries by 2050|accessdate=2006-1-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/europe/what_we_do/mediterranean/about/marine/bluefin_tuna/tuna_at_risk/index.cfm|title=Atlantic bluefin tuna could soon be commercially extinct|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref>

===Habitat destruction===
A key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water [[pollution]], the building of [[dams]], removal of water for use by humans, and the introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 463, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the [[pallid sturgeon]], a North American freshwater fish that living in rivers that have all been changed by human activity in a variety of different ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mt.nrcs.usda.gov/news/factsheets/pallidsturgeon.html|title=Threatened and Endangered Species: Pallid Sturgeon ''Scaphirhynchus'' Fact Sheet|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref>

===Exotic species===
Introduction of [[invasive species|exotic]] species has occurred in a variety of places and for many different reasons. One of the nest studied (and most severe) examples was the introduction of [[Nile perch]] into [[Lake Victoria]]. Since the 1960s the Nile perch gradually exterminated the 500 species of [[cichlid]] fishes found only in this lake and nowhere else. Some species survive now only in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,,1541613,00.html|title=The little fish fight back|accessdate=2006-1-18}}</ref> [[Carp]], [[snakehead]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16439-2002Jul2.html|title=Stop That Fish!|accessdate=2007-08-26}}</ref> [[tilapia]], [[perch|European perch]], [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[sea lamprey]]s are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.

===Aquarium collecting===
{{main|Fishkeeping#Conservation_and_Science}}

==Culture==
Through the ages, many cultures have featured fish in their [[legends]] and [[Mythology|myths]], from the "great fish" that swallowed [[Jonah]] the Prophet through to the half-human, half-fish [[mermaid]] around which books and movies have been centred (e.g., ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]''). Among the deities said to take the form of a fish are [[Ika-Roa]] of the [[Polynesians]], [[Dagon#Fish-god tradition|Dagon]] of various ancient [[Semitic]] peoples, and [[Matsya]] of the [[Dravida]]s of India. The [[astrology|astrological]] symbol [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] is based on a constellation of the [[Pisces (constellation)|same name]], but there is also a second fish constellation in the night sky, [[Piscis Austrinus]]. Fish have been used figuratively in many different ways, for example the [[ichthys]] used by early Christians to identify themselves through to the fish as a symbol of fertility among Bengalis.<ref>Jaffrey, M.: A Taste of India, Atheneum, p 148, 1988, ISBN 0-689-70726-6</ref> Fish have also featured prominently in art and literature, as in movies such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and books such as ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''. Large fish, particularly sharks, have frequently been the subject of [[Horror film|horror movies]] and [[Thriller (genre)|thrillers]], most notably the novel ''[[Peter Benchley#Jaws|Jaws]]'', which spawned a series of films of the [[Jaws (film)|same name]] that in turn inspired similar films or parodies such as ''[[Shark Tale]]'', ''[[Snakehead Terror]]'', and ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]''.

== Terminology ==
=== Fish or fishes ===

Though often used interchangeably, these words actually mean different things. '''''Fish''''' is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species. '''''Fishes''''' describes a group containing more than one species.<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 3, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref> Hence, as plurals, these words could be used thus:

* My aquarium contains three different fishes: guppies, platies, and swordtails.
* The North Atlantic stock of ''Gadus morhua'' is estimated to contain several million fish.

=== Shoal or school ===
[[Image:School of reef fish at Rapture Reef, French Frigate Shoals.jpg|thumb|right|250px|These [[Holocentridae|squirrelfish]] are shoaling, not schooling: though swimming as a group, their speed and direction is not synchronised.]]
[[Image:School of jacjs.JPG|thumb|250px|These [[Jack (fish)|jacks]] are schooling because their swimming is synchronised.]]

A random assemblage of fishes merely using some localised resource such as food or nesting sites is known simply as an '''''aggregation'''''. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a ''shoal'' or a ''school'' depending on the degree of organisation. A '''''shoal''''' is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the other members of the group. '''''Schools''''' of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages (see article on [[swarm]]ing, the term used to cover such behaviours in animals).<ref>Helfman G., Collette B., & Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 375, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7</ref>

* Cichlids congregating at [[Lek (mating arena)|lekking]] sites form an aggregation.
* Many minnows and characins form shoals.
* Classic examples of schooling fish are anchovies, herrings, and silversides.

While school and shoal have different meanings within biology, they are often treated as [[synonym]]s by non-specialists, with speakers of [[British English]] using "shoal" to describe any grouping of fish, while speakers of [[American English]] often using "school" just as loosely.
