'''State Route 347''' ('''SR 347'''), also known as '''John Wayne Parkway''', is a {{convert|28.69|mi|km}} long, north&ndash;south state highway in central [[Arizona]].  The route begins at [[Arizona State Route 84|SR 84]] and heads north. It passes through [[Maricopa, Arizona|Maricopa]], meeting [[Arizona State Route 238|SR 238]]. The route ends at an interchange with [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] (I-10) south of Chandler. It primarily serves as the major road to Maricopa; much of the road lies within the [[Gila River Indian Community]], with another short stretch through the [[Ak-Chin Indian Community]]. The road was built in the late 1930s and established as a state highway in the 1990s. On average, between 4,000 and 35,000 vehicles use the roadway daily.  

== Route description ==
The route begins at an intersection with SR 84 west of [[Stanfield, Arizona|Stanfield]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mpd/gis/maps/pdf/tbd4.pdf|title=Transportation District 4 Milepost System|publisher=Arizona Department of Transportation|format=PDF|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> SR 347 then heads northward as John Wayne Parkway, a four-lane expressway, which SR 347 is for its entirety, through a desert landscape. After intersecting Meadowview Road and crossing a canal, SR 347 meets Carefree Place, where a farm appears to the west part of the road.<ref name="google"/> At Clayton Road, the east side of the road becmes farmland as well. John Wayne Parkway enters the Ak-Chin Indian Community, passing the Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, and intersects [[BIA Route 14]] within this community.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ak-chin.nsn.us/pdf/acicdirections.pdf|format=PDF|title=Ak-Chin Indian Community Directions|publisher=[[Ak-Chin Indian Community]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> At Route 14, the route becomes Maricopa Road, but retains its name as John Wayne Parkway, as it heads toward Maricopa. Continuing on its northerly path, the road exits the Indian community with a residential area to the west and desert to the east.<ref name="google"/> Past Bowlin road, this orientation switches, as the residential area is located on the east side of Maricopa Road. The arrangement of the landscape switches again at Desert Cedars Road, where the road passes the Maricopa First Baptist Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbcmaricopa.org/AboutUs/MapandDirections.aspx|title=Map of the First Baptist Church of Maricopa|author=First Baptist Church of Maricopa|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> Before meeting the Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, the road passes [[Maricopa High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopausd.org/index.cfm?pID=2574|title=Maricopa Unified School District Schools|author=[[Maricopa Unified School District]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by [[Amtrak]].

North of this highway, SR 347 passes Honeycutt Road and passes by the Pinal County Justice Court. After an intersection with Edison Road, SR 347 passes several businesses before intersecting SR 238, named Smith Enke Road.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mpd/gis/maps/pdf/section1.pdf|title=2009 ADOT Map Book: Section 1|publisher=Arizona Department of Transportation|format=PDF|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> The route then enters another residential area before abruptly passing into the desert.<ref name="google"/> The road turns more northeasterly, heading through the Gila River Indian Community.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.gilariver.org/index.php/about-tribe/6-districts/117-gila-river-districts|title=Gila River Districts|publisher=[[Gila River Indian Community]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> Turning back north and slightly northeast again, the road crosses from [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]] into [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mpd/gis/maps/pdf/tbd1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Transportation District 1 Milepost System|publisher=Arizona Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> After intersecting Riggs Road, Maricopa Road veers away from John Wayne Parkway, which SR 347 follows. Now as Queen Creek Road, which serves as another name, SR 347 heads east for a small distance, ending at a [[diamond interchange]] at I-10's exit 164. Queen Creek Road continues toward [[Chandler Municipal Airport]].<ref name="ADOT Highway Log"/><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=2529850674388876838,32.875060,-112.049140%3B7444233191775362588,33.254890,-111.949319&saddr=AZ-347%2FN+John+Wayne+Pkwy%2FS+Maricopa+Rd+%4032.875060,+-112.049140&daddr=W+Queen+Creek+Rd+%4033.254890,+-111.949319&doflg=ptm&jsv=107&sll=33.064975,-111.99938&sspn=0.396479,0.639954&ie=UTF8&z=11 |title=overview map of SR 347 |accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>

The route is maintained by the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] (ADOT), who is responsible for maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, the department periodically conducts surveys to measure traffic on highways in Arizona. These surveys are most often presented in the form of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is the number of vehicles that use a highway on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around 4,500 vehicles used the road daily near the SR 84 intersection and about 33,000 vehicles used the route near the I-10 interchange on an average day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mpd/data/Reports/PDF/CurrentAADT.pdf|title=Arizona State Highway Traffic Log|author=Arizona Department of Transportation|format=PDF|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> No part of the highway has been listed in the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/az/phoenix_az.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Highway System: Pheonix-Mesa, Arizona|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mpd/gis/maps/pdf/NHS.pdf|title=National Highway System|format=PDF|publisher=Arizona Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
The section north of Maricopa, toward present day I-10, was built by 1939. The road headed north toward [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] to [[U.S. Route 80|U.S. Route 80]] (US 80).<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.aaroads.com/west/maps/1939-az.html|title=Road Map of Arizona|date=1939|publisher=[[Arizona Highway Department]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> Between 1951 and 1958, the road was extended south to its current terminus at SR 84; at this time, I-10 had still not been built, nor had the route become a numbered route.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.aaroads.com/west/maps/1958-az.html|title=Road Map of Arizona|date=1958|publisher=Arizona State Highway Department|cartography=[[Rand McNally]]|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> By 1971, I-10 was finished through the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix area]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.aaroads.com/west/maps/1971-az.html|title=Road Map of Arizona|publisher=Arizona State Highway Department|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1989, ADOT made preparations to establish the number along Maricopa Road and reserved the right-of-way along the parkway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azhighwaydata.com/resolutions/?syear=1988&eyear=1990&crc=3&rtnum=347&submit1=Submit|title=ADOT Right-of-Way Resolution 1989-04-A-032|author=Arizona Department of Transportation|accessdate=March 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|title=New Deluxe Road Atlas|publisher=H.M.
