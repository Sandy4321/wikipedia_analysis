==History==
===Ballparks in Williamsport before Bowman Field===

Williamsport has hosted minor league baseball since the late 19th century.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 7">''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 7</ref> The various teams played at differing sights in Williamsport. The earliest ballfield was near the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]].<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 7"/> It was long since been replaced by a [[levee]] and [[U.S. Route 220]], [[U.S. Route 15]] and [[Interstate 180 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 180]]. A second and more permanent facility was built in the Vallamont neighborhood.<ref>''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 33</ref> Cochran Elementary School sits on the former sight of the ballpark. The Williamsport Billies and later Williamsport Grays played the seasons at Williamsport High School's athletic field on West Third Street.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 46">''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 46</ref><ref name="hunsinger">{{cite web | url = http://www.crosscutters.com/historicbowmanfield.htm | title = Welcome to Historic Bowman Field, Williamsport, PA. | accessdate = 2008-08-14 | author = Hunsinger, Jr., Lou | publisher = Williamsport Crosscutters}}</ref> It too is long since gone, this property is currently home to the [[Pennsylvania College of Technology]].

===Construction, opening and renaming===

Bowman Field was completed in 1926 to host the city's entry as an original franchise in the [[New York-Pennsylvania League (early 20th century)|New York-Pennsylvania League]] called the [[Williamsport Grays]]. The Grays were a charter member of the New York-Pennsylvania league which was established in 1923.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 46"/> Two of the most important boosters and financial backers of the team were J. Walton Bowman for whom the stadium was named and Thomas Gray, the [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]], for whom the Grays were named.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 46"/>

The Grays had previously been playing their home games on the athletic field of Williamsport High School. This facility proved to be much too small.<ref>''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 78</ref> A larger and more permanent stadium was needed. A group of civic leaders and baseball boosters lead the drive to construct a new stadium for the Grays on the western side of Williamsport on the banks of [[Lycoming Creek]]. An agreement between the Grays and the city was reached in July, 1925 to build what was then known as Memorial Field, which was named for the municipal park in which it is located.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 79">''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 79</ref> J. Walton Bowman headed an eleven member [[holding company]] that financed and managed the construction of the ballpark at a cost of $75,000.<ref name="hunsinger"/><ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 79"/> Ground was broken in the fall of 1925 and the stadium opened in time for the beginning of the 1926 New York-Pennsylvania League season.<ref>''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 79-80</ref>

The original dimensions of Bowman Field were quite large compared to the dimensions of modern baseball fields. Bowman Field measured 367 feet to the [[right field]] [[foul pole]], 450 feet to dead [[center field]] and 400 feet to the [[left field]] foul pole.<ref name="hunsinger"/><ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 81">''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 81</ref> Another unusual feature of the stadium was a [[terrace]] that was located on left field near the fence.<ref>''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 80</ref> 

The first game to be played at Bowman Field took place on April 22, 1926 when the Grays hosted the ballteam of nearby [[Bucknell University]] in an exhibition. The first professional opponent to appear at Bowman Field was the Harrisburg Colored Giants. The Grays lost two games to the Giants on April 27 and 29. The first New York-Pennsylvania League game took place on May 4. The Grays beat the Shamokin Indians 5-1.<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 81"/> 

Bowman Field was known as Memorial Field from 1926 until 1929. It was renamed on June 26, 1929 to honor J. Walton Bowman. Bowman was the president of the Grays at the time and head by intsrumental in the effort of funding and constructing the stadium. He was additionally honored by the players of the team with a [[Swiss watch]] and his grand-daughter was given the honor of hoisting a pennant in center field bearing the name "Bowman Field".<ref name="Gateway to the Majors pg. 81"/>

===Eastern League===

The [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] was at Bowman off and on for nearly seventy years. The Willaimsport Grays started play in 1926 in Bowman Field. The final Eastern League team to call the park home was the 1991 [[Williamsport Bills]]. That team moved to [[Binghamton, New York]], the next season and became the [[Binghamton Mets]].

The Grays began playing in the forerunner of the Eastern League, the old New York - Pennsylvania Leauge in 1923.<ref name="hunsinger"/><ref>''Gateway to the Majors'' pg. 97</ref> The Class B league was made entirely of teams from [[New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. It kept this name until 1938 when the [[Scranton Miners]] move to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]].<ref name="eastern">{{cite web | url = http://www.easternleague.com/history.htm | title = Eastern League Baseball: History | accessdate = 2008-08-15 | publisher = Eastern League}}</ref> Williamsport was a member of the league for 46 years between 1923 and 1991. The teams were know as the Grays, Tigers, A's, Mets, Tomahawks and Bills. Williamsport had affiliations with the [[Philadelphia A's]] for three periods, [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], [[Philadelphia Phillies]], [[New York Mets]] for two separate periods, [[Cleveland Indians]] for two separate periods, and [[Seattle Mariners]].
====The potato incident====
Dave Bresnahan was [[Catcher|catching]] for the 1987 Williamsport Bills, who were in seventh place in an eight-team league, playing the last-place [[Reading Phillies]] in late-August game.<ref name="spud">{{cite web | url = http://www.crosscutters.com/history.htm | title = The Great Potato Caper... Revisited | accessdate = 2008-08-14 | author = Tom Speicher | publisher = [[Williamsport Crosscutters]]}}</ref> With a runner on third base, Bresnahan switched catcher's mitts and put on a glove in which he had secreted a shaved-down potato. When the pitch came in, Bresnahan fired the white potato down the third-base line, enticing the runner to sprint home. Bresnahan then tagged the runner with the baseball, prompting the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] to award the runner home plate for Bresnahan's deception.<ref name="spud"/> 

The president of the Eastern League took offense to what he perceived as Bresnahan's affront to the game, banning the grandnephew of [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Roger Bresnahan]] from the league. However, the citizens of Williamsport applauded Bresnahan for his ingenuity, eventually prompting the club to retire his number 59.<ref name="spud"/> At the retirement ceremony in 1998, Bresnahan was quoted as saying, <U+201C>[[Lou Gehrig]] had to play in 2,130 consecutive games and hit .340 for his number to be retired, and all I had to do was bat .140 and throw a potato.<U+201D><ref name="potato">{{cite web | url = http://www.baseballreliquary.org/Bresnahan.htm | title = Dave Bresnahan Potato | accessdate = 2008-08-14 | publisher = The Baseball Reliquary Inc.}}</ref>

===New York - Penn League===

For the 1994 season, baseball returned to Bowman with the [[New York - Penn League]]'s [[Williamsport Cubs]].  The club became the Crosscutters, a [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] farm team, in 1999.  Significant stadium upgrades took place prior to the 2002 season.  The club became a farm team of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 2006.
