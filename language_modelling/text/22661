'''Coalition to Diversify Income''' (CoDI) is one of the programmes led by Crops for the Future (through its predecessor <U+2013> ICUC) and has been carried out in eight locations in India and Vietnam<ref> ''Sak<U+0101>l Times'', 2011-03-22, [http://www.sakaaltimes.com/sakaaltimesbeta/20110322/5175850685006512789.htm"Farmers diversify income, thanks to BAIF"].

CoDI is designed to assist small farmers to develop and implement better practice in crop production and post-harvest management, as well as to overcome the limitation of market access in order to generate more income<ref>Jaenicke, H. et al.
