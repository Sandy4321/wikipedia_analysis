'''University of Phoenix Stadium''' is a multipurpose [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] located in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. It is the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and the annual [[Fiesta Bowl]]. The stadium is located next door to the [[Jobing.com Arena]], where the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Phoenix Coyotes]] play, and it features the first fully retractable natural grass playing surface built in the United States on top of an AirField Systems synthetic drainage system. An opening on one side of the stadium allows the playing field to move to the exterior of the building, allowing the entire natural turf playing surface to be exposed to daylight when it is not in use and also allowing the floor to be used for other purposes without damaging the playing surface. The stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] and the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]], a game that it hosts every four years. The stadium also hosted [[WrestleMania XXVI]], which set the venue's entertainment attendance record of 72,219 on March 28, 2010.<ref name="Attendance"/><ref name="AttendancePhoenix"/>

The [[University of Phoenix]], a [[For-profit school|for-profit university]] specializing in [[adult education]], acquired the [[naming rights]] in September 2006, shortly after the stadium had opened under the name '''Cardinals Stadium'''. The "University of Phoenix" name is applied as a corporate sponsor, and not as the home stadium of the University (which has no intercollegiate athletics program).

==Facility information==
The 63,400-seat stadium (expandable to 72,200) opened on August 1, 2006 after three years of construction.<ref>http://www.universityofphoenixstadium.com/index.php?page=stadium_facts&section=statistics</ref> It is considered an architectural icon for the region and was named by [[Business Week]] as one of the 10 <U+201C>most impressive<U+201D> sports facilities on the globe due to the combination of its retractable roof (engineering design by [[Walter P Moore Engineers and Consultants|Walter P Moore]] to a scheme design by [[Buro Happold]]) and roll-in natural grass field<ref>[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/02/sports_stadiums/source/9.htm World-Class Sports Stadiums | BusinessWeek<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is the only American facility on the list. The ceremonial groundbreaking for the new stadium was held on April 12, 2003. 

The cost of the project was [[United States dollar|$]]455 million. That total included $395.4 million for the stadium, $41.7 million for site improvements, and $17.8 million for the land. Contributors to the stadium included the [[Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority]] ($302.3 million), the [[Arizona Cardinals]] ($143.2 million), and the [[Glendale, Arizona|City of Glendale]] ($9.5 million).

[[File:University of Phoenix Stadium roof.jpg|175px|left|thumb|The roof of University of Phoenix Stadium.]]
The first preseason football game was played August 12, 2006 when the Cardinals defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], 21-13. The first regular season game was played September 10 against the [[San Francisco 49ers]] (the Cardinals won 34&ndash;27). The stadium's air-conditioning system made it possible for the Cardinals to play at home on the opening weekend of the NFL season for the first time since moving to [[Arizona]] in 1988.

The stadium hosted the highest attended soccer match in the state of Arizona on February 7, 2007 when 62,462 fans watched the [[United States men's national soccer team]] defeat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], 2&ndash;0.

[[File:UniversityofPhoenixStadiumnasa.png|175px|right|thumb|University of Phoenix Stadium from a bird's eye view]]
The multipurpose nature of the facility has allowed it to host 91 events representing 110 event days between the dates of August 4, 2006 through the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]] January 8, 2007. These events included [[Arizona Cardinals]] games; public grand opening tours held August 19 & 20, 2006 (attended by 120,000 people); various shows, expositions, tradeshows and motor sport events; the [[Rolling Stones]] concert November 8 2006; the AIA 4A and 5A state championship games for football (the first high school to win a football championship at the stadium was Cactus Shadows High School of Cave Creek, AZ on December 2, 2006); an international soccer exhibition match; the Fiesta Bowl National Band Championship High School Marching Band competition (the first marching band to ever play on the field was [[Foothill High School]], from [[Pleasanton, California]] on December 29, 2006); the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] January 1, 2007 featuring the [[Boise State]] Broncos vs. the [[University of Oklahoma]] Sooners (Boise State won 43-42 in overtime); and the BCS National Championship January 8, 2007 between the No. 1 [[Ohio State]] Buckeyes and the No. 2 [[University of Florida]] Gators, which the Gators won 41-14. It also held the [[2008 Fiesta Bowl]] between the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] and the [[West Virginia University Mountaineers]], as well as the [[2009 Fiesta Bowl]] between the [[Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Ohio State Buckeyes]]. It has also held many high school graduations.

The Cardinals' first home playoff game since the 1940s took place at the stadium on Jan. 3, 2009, with Arizona beating the [[Atlanta Falcons]], 30-24. The stadium also hosted the [[NFL playoffs, 2008<U+2013>09#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles at Arizona Cardinals|2008-09 NFC Championship Game]] between the Cardinals and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on Jan. 18, 2009, which the Cardinals won 32-25 in front of 70,650 fans in attendance.

[[File:University of Phoenix Stadium no field.jpg|175px|right|thumb|University of Phoenix Stadium with field removed.]]
The stadium has 88 [[luxury suites]] &mdash; called luxury lofts &mdash; with space for 16 future suites as the stadium matures.

The {{convert|25|acre|m2}} surrounding the stadium is called Sportsman's Park. Included within the Park is an {{convert|8|acre|m2|sing=on}} landscaped tailgating area called the Great Lawn.

There are no obstructed view seats in the stadium. There are visible areas in the upper deck of the end zone where seats could have been put in but were not due to the giant super columns supporting the roof structure.

[[File:cardswin1.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Cardinals win NFC Championship, 18 Jan., 2009.]]

The stadium [[seating capacity]] can be expanded by 9,600 for "mega-events" such as college bowls, NFL Super Bowls, and the [[NFL playoffs, 2008<U+2013>09#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles at Arizona Cardinals|2008-09 NFC]] [[NFC Championship Game|Championship Game]]<ref>http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/2009/01/11/20090111cardsellout-CR.html</ref>  by adding risers and ganged, portable "X-frame" folding seats. The endzone area on the side of the facility where the field tray rolls in and out of the facility can be expanded to accommodate the additional seats.

The roof is made out of [[translucent]] "Bird-Air" fabric and opens in twelve minutes. It is the first retractable roof ever built on an incline.

The shape of the stadium is loosely modeled after a [[barrel cactus]], a widespread plant in the Arizona desert.

University of Phoenix Stadium hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008 in which the [[New York Giants]] defeated the previously undefeated [[New England Patriots]] 17-14 with a paid attendance crowd of 71,101. This game was mentioned as one of the biggest upsets of all time. This was the second time the [[Phoenix metropolitan area|Phoenix area]] hosted a [[Super Bowl]], the other being [[Super Bowl XXX]] held in nearby [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in 1996 when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].
