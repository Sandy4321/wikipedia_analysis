'''Bennie Iva "Blanche" Frasure''' (n<U+00E9>e '''Caldwell''') ([[January 1]], [[1911]] - [[December 24]], [[1988]]) was the third wife of [[Buck Barrow|Marvin "Buck" Barrow]] and a member of the [[Barrow gang]]. Born in [[Garvin, Oklahoma]], she was the only child of Matthew Fontain Caldwell (June 23, 1871 - September 19, 1947) and Lillain Bell Pond (c.1894 - February 24, 1995). At the time of her birth her father was 40 years old and her mother was 16 years old. Her parents divorced while Blanche was still a young child and she was raised by her father, who was beloved by her for the rest of her life. Her father made his living as a logger and a farmer. Matthew Caldwell was a devoutly religious man and occasionally preached as a lay minister, even though he was not an ordained minister. At age 17, Blanche was forced to marry a much older John Callaway, a marriage arranged by her mother, who offered Blanche to Callaway on the premise that Callaway had money and would reward both her and Blanche. Blanche ran away in [[1929]] and met Buck Barrow two years later. In her book, "My Life with Bonnie and Clyde", Blanche maintains that the experience with Callaway left her unable to bear children.

==Barrow Gang==
Buck and Blanche married on [[July 2]], [[1932]]. After marrying Buck, Blanche participated in a string of [[armed robbery|armed robberies]] with him. At one point, Blanche persuaded Buck to turn himself in after having escaped from prison. When Buck and Clyde joined forces, Blanche spent several months on the run with Bonnie and Clyde. 

While there is no evidence she ever fired a gun during this time, she was present at shootouts in [[Joplin, Missouri]] in which two law officers were killed and [[Platte County, Missouri]] at the [[Red Crown Tourist Court]] in which three officers were wounded and Buck was mortally wounded (and she was eventually to lose sight in her eye from her wounds). 

After the Platte County shootout they fled with Bonnie and Clyde to [[Dexter, Iowa]] where she was captured in another shootout. Buck died at [[Kings Daughters Hospital]] in [[Perry, Iowa]] on July 29 of a head wound from the Platte County shootout.

Blanche was taken back to Platte County by Platte County sheriff [[Holt Coffee]] who had been wounded in the shootout.  She was to remain in contact with the sheriff and his family, as well as Platte City prosecutor David Clevenger throughout the rest of her life. At the time of her arrest Blanche weighed eighty-one pounds and stood five foot one inch.

==Sentence and Later Life==
Blanche was sentenced to ten years in prison for her part in the Joplin shootout, where two officers were killed. She served six years and received state-of-the-art medical treatment for her left eye, which was pierced with glass during the gangs' flight from the Platte City tourist court, although she eventually lost all sight in the eye.

Following her release from prison, Blanche Barrow moved back to [[Dallas, Texas]].  She was remarried in [[1940]] to Eddie Frasure.  One year later she completed her [[parole]]. The couple had one adopted son called Ricky. Blanche lived quietly with her husband until her death from cancer on 24 December 1988 - a little over a week away from her 78<sup>th</sup> birthday. She was buried in Dallas's Grove Hill Memorial Park under the name "Blanche B. Frasure" <ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6999750</ref>. Her memoirs, ''My Life With Bonnie and Clyde'', were published in 2004 (ISBN 0-8061-3715-0).

==Reaction to the film "Bonnie and Clyde"==
On [[April 10]], [[1968]] at [[40th Academy Awards]] ceremony, [[Estelle Parsons]] won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|best actress in a supporting role]] for her portrayal of Blanche in the film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde (1967)]]''. Blanche was unhappy with the film and is quoted as saying, "That movie made me look like a screaming horse's ass."<ref>http://texashideout.tripod.com/movie.html</ref>
