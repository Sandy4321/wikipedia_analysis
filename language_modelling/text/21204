==Early life==
Little saw his first circus at the age of seven, which instilled a life-long love of the circus in him.<ref name="sun-sentinel" /><ref name="schenectady" />  His nickname "Frosty" was given to him as a boy by his grandfather, who compared him to [[Jack Frost]] due to his love of playing in the snow.<ref name="sun-sentinel"/><ref name="schenectady" />  It is more than a stage name; he even signs his checks "Frosty Little".<ref name="isubengal" />

Little served in the US Navy during World War II, and was wounded.  He learned juggling from a fellow patient while convalescing, a skill that would later help him land his first clowning jobs.<ref name="sun-sentinel" />

In 1950, he married his wife, Patricia, who is a photographer and former schoolteacher, with whom he has two daughters.<ref name="sun-sentinel" /><ref name="schenectady" />

==Early career==
Prior to joining the Ringling outfit, Little worked as a [[US Postal Service|postal employee]] and [[surveying|land surveyor]] in [[Colorado]].  From 1954 to 1956, he performed as a clown at a local amusement park on weekends, wearing a rented costume.<ref name="sun-sentinel" />  In 1956, he went into clowning full-time after he was hired by the Joe King Circus, with which he toured the [[Rocky Mountain States]] for half of the year.<ref name="schenectady" /><ref name="sun-sentinel" /><ref name="Sarasota Herald-Tribune 19.02.10">{{cite news | title = Clown coach teaches funny art | first = Mark | last = Hansen | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=f8EqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6931,2723333&dq=glen-frosty-little&hl=en | newspaper = Sarasota Herald-Tribune | date = November 5, 1979 | page = 18 | accessdate = February 19, 2010}}</ref>  The rest of the year, he freelanced as a clown at birthday parties and special events.<ref name="schenectady" />  He continued working for the Joe King circus for seven years until its closure in 1962.<ref name="sun-sentinel" />
