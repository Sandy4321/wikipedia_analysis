'''Pop music''' (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of "popular") is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[popular music]] which originated in the 1950s, deriving from [[rock and roll]].<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, even though the former is a description of any form of music which is popular (and can include any genre), whilst the latter is a specific genre of music which has qualities which would make it appealing to a large audience.<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> Pop music, as a genre, is very eclectic, often borrowing elements from other styles throughout its course such as [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[dance music|dance]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[country music|country]],<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> yet there are core elements which define it. Such include generally short-to-medium length songs, written in a basic format which is often the [[verse-chorus]] structure, which generally make usage of repeated choruses, have a melodic sound, and have catchy [[hook (music)|hook]]s.<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> So-called "pure pop" music, such as [[power pop]], features all these elements, and for instrumentation uses [[electric guitar]]s, [[drum]]s and a [[Bass (guitar)|bass]];<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> in the case of such music, the main goal is usually that of being pleasurable to listen to, rather than having much artistic depth.<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref> Pop music is generally thought of as a genre which is commercially recorded and desires to appeal to a mass audience.<ref>http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/a/popmusic.htm</ref>

== Definitions ==
David Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as "a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz and folk musics".<ref>D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), ISBN 0-7190-1489-1, p. 1.</ref> Although pop music is often seen as oriented towards the [[Record chart|singles charts]] it is not the sum of all chart music, which has always contained songs from a variety of sources, including [[Classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[novelty song]]s, while pop music as a genre is usually seen as existing and developing separately.<ref>R. Serge Denisoff and William L. Schurk, ''Tarnished Gold: the Record Industry Revisited'' (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 3rd edn., 1986), ISBN 0-88738-618-0, pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> Thus "pop music" may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to [[rock and roll]].<ref name=Firth2001/>

== Origin of the term ==
The term "pop song" is first recorded as being used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music "having popular appeal".<ref name=OED>J. Simpson and E. Weiner, ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), ISBN 0-19-861186-2, cf pop.</ref> Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in [[Country music|country]], [[blues]] and [[Hillbilly music|hillbilly]] music.<ref>D. Hatch and S. Millward, ''From Blues to Rock: an Analytical History of Pop Music'', ISBN 0-7190-1489-1, p. 49.</ref>

According to ''Grove Music Online'', the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for Rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced ...".<ref name=Grove>R. Middleton, et al, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo "Pop"], ''Grove music online'', retrieved 14 March 2010. {{Subscription required}}</ref> ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'' states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience ...[,] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[ABBA]], etc."<ref>"Pop", ''[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_t237 ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music''], retrieved 9 March 2010.{{Subscription required}}</ref> ''Grove Music Online'' also states that "... in the early 1960s [the term] <U+2018>pop music<U+2019> competed terminologically with [[Beat music]] [in England], while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of <U+2018>rock and roll<U+2019>."<ref name=Grove/> ''Chambers' Dictionary'' mentions the contemporary usage of the term "[[pop art]]";<ref>A. M. Macdonald, ed., ''Chambers' Twentieth Century Dictionary'' (Edinburgh: Chambers Harrap, 1977), ISBN 0-550-10231-0, cf. ''pop''.</ref> ''Grove Music Online'' states that the "term pop music ... seems to have been a spin-off from the terms pop art and [[pop culture]], coined slightly earlier, and referring to a whole range of new, often American, media-culture products".<ref name=Grove/> 

From about 1967 the term was increasingly used in opposition to the term [[rock music]], a division that gave generic significance to both terms.<ref name=Gloag983>Kenneth Gloag in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-19-866212-2, p. 983.</ref> Whereas rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music,<ref name=Gloag983/> pop was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.<ref name=Warner2003>T. Warner, ''Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), ISBN 0-7546-3132-X, pp. 3-4.</ref> According to [[Simon Frith]] pop music is produced "as a matter of enterprise not art", is "designed to appeal to everyone" and "doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste". It is "not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative". It is, "provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers and concert promoters) rather than being made from below ... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged".<ref name="Frith 95-96">S. Frith, "Pop music", in S. Frith, W. Straw and J. Street, eds, ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), ISBN 0-521-55660-0, pp. 95<U+2013>6.</ref>

== Influences and development == 
Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from most other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on the [[Ballad#Sentimental ballads|sentimental ballad]] for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]], instrumentation from [[jazz]], [[country]], and rock music, orchestration from [[classical music]], tempo from [[dance music]], backing from [[electronic music]], rhythmic elements from hip-hop music, and has recently appropriated spoken passages from [[rap music|rap]].<ref name=Firth2001>S. Frith, W. Straw, and J. Street, eds, ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), ISBN 0-521-55660-0, pp. 95-6.</ref>
 
It has also made use of technological innovation. In the 1940s improved [[microphone]] design allowed a more intimate singing style<ref name=Buckley/> and ten or twenty years later inexpensive and more durable 45 r.p.m. records for singles "revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated" and helped to move pop music to <U+2018>a record/radio/film star system<U+2019>.<ref name=Buckley>D. Buckley, "Pop" "II. Implications of technology", ''Grove Music Online'', retrieved 15 March 2010.</ref> Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s; with televised performances, "pop stars had to have a visual presence".<ref name=Buckley/> In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable [[transistor radio]]s meant that teenagers could listen to music outside of the home.<ref name=Buckley/> [[Multi-track recording]] (from the 1960s); and [[Sampling (music)|digital sampling]] (from the 1980s) have also been utilized as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music.<ref name=Firth2001/> By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of Music Television channels like [[MTV]], which "favoured those artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Madonna (musician)|Madonna]] who had a strong visual appeal".<ref name=Buckley/>

Pop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British [[music industry|music industries]], whose influence has made pop music something of an international [[monoculture]], but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics.<ref>J. Kun, ''Audiotopia: Music, Race, and America'' (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2005), ISBN 0-520-24424-9, p. 201.</ref> Some of these trends (for example [[Europop]]) have had a significant impact of the development of the genre.<ref name=Firth2001>"Star profiles" in S. Frith, W. Stray and J. Street, ''The Cambridge Companion to Pop and Rock'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-521-55660-0, pp. 199<U+2013>200.</ref> 

According to ''Grove Music Online'', "Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures".<ref name=PManuel>P. Manuel, "Pop. Non-Western cultures 1. Global dissemination", ''Grove Music Online'', retrieved 14 March 2010.</ref> Some non-Western countries, such as Japan, have developed a thriving pop music industry, most of which is devoted to Western-style pop, has for several years has produced a greater quantity of music of everywhere except the USA.<ref name=PManuel/> The spread of Western-style pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of Americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative appropriation, cultural imperialism, and/or a more general process of globalization.<ref name=PManuel/>

== Characteristics == 
Musicologists often identify the following characteristics as typical of the pop music genre: 
* an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology<ref name=Firth2001/> 
* an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal "artistic" qualities<ref name=Firth2001/>
* an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, over live performance<ref name=Warner2003/>
* a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments<ref name=Warner2003/>
* much pop music is intended to encourage dancing, or it uses dance-oriented beats or rhythms<ref name=Warner2003/>

The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable [[Rhythm|rhythmic element]], a mainstream style and a simple traditional [[Song structure (popular music)|structure]].<ref>W. Everett, ''Expression in Pop-rock Music: A Collection of Critical and Analytical Essays'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2000), p. 272.</ref> Common variants include the [[verse-chorus form]] and the [[thirty-two-bar form]], with a focus on [[Melody|melodies]] and catchy [[Hook (music)|hooks]], and a [[Refrain|chorus]] that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and [[Harmony|harmonically]] with the [[Verse (popular music)#Verse|verse]].<ref>J. Shepherd, ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Performance and production'' (Continuum, 2003), p. 508.</ref> The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment.<ref>V. Kramarz, ''The Pop Formulas: Harmonic Tools of the Hit Makers'' (Mel Bay Publications, 2007), p. 61.</ref> The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes <U+2013> often love and romantic relationships <U+2013> although there are notable exceptions.<ref name=Firth2001/>

[[Chord progression|Harmony]] in pop music is often "that of classical European [[tonality]], only more simple-minded."<ref>Winkler, Peter (1978). "Toward a theory of pop harmony", ''In Theory Only'', 4, pp. 3-26.</ref> Clich<U+00E9>s include the [[barbershop harmony]] (i.e. moving from a [[secondary dominant]] harmony to a [[dominant (music)|dominant]] harmony, and then to the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) and [[blues scale]]-influenced harmony.<ref>Sargeant, p. 198. cited in Winkler (1978), p. 4.</ref> "The influence of the [[circle of fifths|circle-of-fifths]] paradigm has declined since the mid-1950s. The harmonic languages of rock and soul have moved away from the all-encompassing influence of the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] [[diatonic function|function]]. ...There are other tendencies (perhaps also traceable to the use of a guitar as a composing instrument) <U+2013> [[pedal point|pedal-point]] harmonies, root motion by [[diatonic]] [[Steps and skips|step]], [[Musical mode|modal]] harmonic and melodic organization <U+2013> that point away from [[tonality|functional tonality]] and toward a tonal sense that is less directional, more free-floating."<ref>Winkler (1978), p. 22.</ref>
