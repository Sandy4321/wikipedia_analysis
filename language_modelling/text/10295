The '''Aqsunqur Mosque''' (also known as the '''Blue Mosque''' or the '''Mosque of Ibrahim Agha''') is located in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] and is one of several [[Blue Mosque|"blue mosques"]] in the world. It is situated in the Tabbana Quarter in [[Islamic Cairo]], between [[Bab Zuweila]] and the [[Cairo Citadel|Citadel of Saladin]] (Cairo Citadel.) The Aqsunqur Mosque also serves as a funerary complex, containing the mausoleums of its founder Shams ad-Din Aqsunqur, his sons, a number of children of the [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri Mamluk]] sultan [[al-Nasir Muhammad|an-Nasir Muhammad]] and that of its principal restorer, Ibrahim Agha al-Mustahfizan.<ref name="Behrens-Abouseif115"/>

===Construction under Mamluks===
The mosque was built in 1347 on the orders of the ''[[emir]]'' ("prince") Shams ad-Din Aqsunqur during the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of al-Muzaffar Hajji.<ref name="Behrens-Abouseif115">Behrens-Abouseif, p.115.</ref><ref name="Williams86"/> Aqsunqur was the son-in-law of former sultan [[al-Nasir Muhammad|an-Nasir Muhammad]] and one of the more prominent ''emirs'' of the latter's court. Aqsunqur's influence in the affairs of the sultanate grew during the reign of an-Nasir's successors following his death in 1340.<ref name="Williams86">Williams, p.86.</ref> 

Medieval [[Muslim]] historian [[al-Maqrizi]] noted Aqsunqur supervised the entire project and also participated in its actual construction. Being the former governor of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], he had the mosque built in a [[Syria]]n architectural style.<ref name="Abouseif116">Behrens-Abouseif, p.116.</ref> It was built around the late sultan [[Kujuk|al-Ashraf Kujuk]]'s mausoleum which had been constructed previously in 1341. The mausoleum's incorporation within the mosque accounts for the irregularity of the building's structure. Aqsunqur's grave is also located in the mosque complex along with those of his sons.<ref name="Abouseif116"/><ref name="Williams86"/> A mausoleum for Umm as-Sultan al-Sha'ban, one of an-Nasir's wives and mother of sultan Kamal Sha'ban, was built in 1359 while another tomb was built for an-Nasir's son Tankizbugha in 1362.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

By the 15th-century the Aqsunqur Mosque was reportedly in poor shape due to the loss of ''[[waqf]]'' ("religious endowments") funds from Syria.<ref name="Abouseif116"/> In 1412 a ''[[Sadirvan|<U+015F>adirvan]]'' ("[[ablution]] fountain") was built in the center of the courtyard by the Mamluk ''emir'' Tughan.<ref name="Williams86"/> Because funding was low, the Aqsunqur Mosque was used only for [[Friday prayer]]s and religious holidays.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

===Restoration by Ottomans===
Between 1652 and 1654, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the ''emir'' Ibrahim Agha al-Mustahfizan, who was a general of the [[Jannisary|Jannisaries]], began a major renovation project for the Aqsunqur Mosque, restoring its roof and arcades, and adding columns to support the mosque's southern prayer hall. Significantly, he decorated the building with blue and green tiles, hence the mosque's unofficial name as the "Blue Mosque".<ref name="Abouseif116"/> The tiles, which were imported from [[Istanbul]] and [[Damascus]],<ref name="Williams87">Williams, p.87.</ref> were crafted in the [[<U+0130>znik pottery|Iznik style]] with floral motifs such as [[cypress tree]]s and vases holding [[tulip]]s.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

Ibrahim Agha built his mausoleum, which was also decorated with marble tiles, in the southern hall. It was constructed using the typical Mamluk architectural style and included a ''[[mihrab]]'' ("prayer nich") resembling the mausoleums of Mamluk ''emirs'' also located in the mosque complex. In line with Ottoman tradition at the time, the Aqsunqur Mosque was officially renamed after its restorer as the "Ibrahim Agha Mosque." The latter name was not used frequently.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

===Modern era===
In 1908 the Aqsunqur Mosque was restored by the Comit<U+00E9> de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe. The [[1992 Cairo earthquake]] damaged the arches of the mosque's [[portico]]es, but they were reinforced by the Egyptian government in the mid-1990s to prevent additional deterioration.<ref name="WMF">[http://www.wmf.org/project/jama%E2%80%99-al-aqsunqur-blue-mosque Jama'ah al-Aqsunqur: Preserving an Early Mamluk Monument and Its Exceptional Iznik Decoration]. [[World Monuments Fund]].</ref> 

The [[Aga Khan Trust for Culture]] (AKTC) in conjunction with the [[World Monuments Fund]] began a restoration project of the mosque in 2009.<ref name="Williams87"/> The AKTC stated the restoration would be finished in 2012. Renovation work would focus structural stability, conservation of the interior and roof repair.<ref name="WMF"/> Today, the Aqsunqur Mosque is also a major destination for tourists visiting Egypt.<ref>Williams, p.85.</ref>

==Architecture==

[[File:Cairo Aqsunqur 1.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[mihrab]]'' (left) and ''[[minbar]]'' (right) of the mosque]]

===Exterior===
The general layout of the mosque consists of a large open courtyard (''sahn'') enclosed by four arcades (''[[riwaq]]s.'')<ref name="Williams86"/> There are three main entrances with the main [[portal (architecture)|portal]] opening into the western arcade. The latter consists of a large pointed [[arch]] with corbels on the front edges of its roof. Facing the courtyard is the ''[[dikka]]'' ("tribune") from which the [[Qur'an]] is recited. The structure uses [[Western Europe]]an-style capitals that Islamic architecture expert Doris Behrens-Abouseif believes were taken from [[Crusader]]-era structures in the [[Levant]].<ref name="Abouseif116"/> 

Kujuk's mausoleum is situated at the portal's northern side and has two [[facade]]s facing the street. Of the two alternative entrances, one opens into the southern arcade while the other opens between the northern and western arcades.<ref name="Behrens-Abouseif115"/> Unlike other tombs in Cairo, Kujuk's mausoleum, which predates the mosque, is not aligned according to the ''[[qibla]]'' ("orientation with [[Mecca]]") and instead is aligned with the street. This structure is the principal feature unique to other major mosques in Egypt.<ref name="Behrens-Abouseif115"/> 

Above the prayer hall sits a brick one-bay [[dome]] carried on four brick [[squinch]]es. A large brick dome supported by brick squinches is also situated atop the mausoleum of Kujuk. However, the latter has a [[pendentive]] below each squinch. When the mosque was originally built this technique of using plain squinches was considered classical.<ref name="ADL"/> Two stone domes are located over the mausoleum of Tankizbugha and another stone dome is built above the tomb of Umm as-Sultan al-Sha'ban.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

===Interior===
The mosque's interior also has an irregular layout mostly due to Ibrahim Agha's renovations which replaced most of the original cross-vaulting of the arcades with columns supporting a flat wooden ceiling. The only part of the mosque that continues to employ Aqsunqur's interior design is the ''qibla'' wall which uses cross-vaults that rest on octagonal-shaped piers.<ref name="Williams86"/> The technique of cross-vaults is a reflection of Islamic Syrian architectural influence. Along with the [[Mosque of Amir al-Maridani]], the Aqsunqur Mosque has a [[hypostyle]] plan which is rare in Cairo and typically associated with Syrian style mosques.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>

The ''[[mihrab]]'' ("prayer niche" that indicates ''qibla'') was built in a geometric [[interlace]] style typically found in Mamluk architecture. The design is used in the ''mihrab's'' [[spandrel]]s. Other features of the ''mihrab'' include the hood's relief painted carvings, fluctuating [[lintel (architecture)|lintel]] panels, marble panels, carved marble [[register (sculpture)|register]]s and [[mosaic]] inlay.<ref name="Williams87"/> To the right of the ''mihrab'' is the marble ''[[minbar]]'' ("pulpit.") Decorated with light gray, [[salmon (color)|salmon]], green and plum-colored stone inserts, it is the oldest and one of the handful remaining marble ''minbars'' used in a Cairo mosque. The handrail is also built of marble and has a pattern of rolling leaf and grape clusters carved from the stone.<ref name="Williams87"/>  

===Minaret===
The minaret is situated at the southern corner of the facade looking into [[Gates of Cairo|Bab al-Wazir]] Street, affording a dominant view of the entire southern part of the street.<ref name="ADL">[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=3454 Amir Aqsunqur Funerary Complex]. ArchNet Digital Library.</ref> It consists of three stories, the first being circular and plain and the second circular and ribbed while the top story is a bulb resting on a pavilion supported by eight slender stone columns. Its circular shaft is rare among Mamluk minarets.<ref name="Abouseif116"/> Prior to its 20th-century restoration, the minaret had four stories. The third story was octagonal and removed during the restoration, depriving the Aqsunqur Mosque a unique feature it shared with another mosque in Cairo, the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|Sultan al-Ghuri Complex]] which has four stories. <ref name="ADL"/> The Aqsunqur Mosque minaret was featured in several 19th-century illustrations.<ref name="Abouseif116"/>
