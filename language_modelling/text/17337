The '''Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata''' was a Japanese [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance]] [[floatplane]] developed during the [[First World War]] by the Japanese Navy Arsenal at [[Yokosuka]], and one of the first indigenous Japanese aircraft to enter production. There were 218 of these aircraft built for the Imperial Japanese Navy, which remained in use until 1928.

==Development and design==
The Japanese Navy Arsenal at Yokosuka became involved in aircraft production in 1913, when an aeroplane factory was set up, with its first work being to build several Maurice Farman and Curtiss Seaplanes.<ref name="Mikesh p262-3"> Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 262<U+2013>263.</ref>  It continued to build aircraft under license, including more Farman aircraft and several [[Short 184]] seaplanes, as well as prototypes of several of its own designs.<ref name="Mikesh p264-8"> Mikesh and Abe 1990, pp. 264<U+2013>268.</ref>

In 1917, [[Chikuhei Nakajima]], chief designer of the Yokosuka Arsenal aircraft factory designed a new reconnaissance [[floatplane]], with a prototype of the new design, powered by a 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) [[Salmson]] water-cooled [[radial engine]], making its maiden flight early in 1918.  Test results were good, and the type was ordered into production as the Ro-go Ko-gata.{{ref label|Note1|a|a}}<ref name="Mikesh p269"> Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.269.</ref>

The Ro-go Ko-gata was a [[interplane strut|three-bay]] [[biplane]] of wood and fabric construction, with twin main floats and wings that folded backwards for storage.  Its crew of two sat in separate, closely spaced cockpits.  Initial production aircraft were powered by 200&nbsp;hp (149&nbsp;kW) Salmson engines, but the majority of production aircraft were fitted with 200<U+2013>220&nbsp;hp (149<U+2013>164&nbsp;kW) [[Mitsubishi]]-built [[Hispano-Suiza 8]] [[V-8 engine]]s.<ref name="Mikesh p269"/> 

A total of 218 aircraft were built in total,<ref name="Donald p922"> Donald 1997, p.922</ref> 32 by the Yokosuka arsenal, 80 by [[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] and 106 by the [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]], with production continuing until 1924.<ref name="Mikesh p270"> Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.270.</ref>  It was the first locally designed aircraft to be built in large numbers for the Japanese Navy.<ref name="Mikesh p269"/>
==Operational history==
Three of the early aircraft were modified in 1919 for making long-range flights, with one of the cockpits replaced by additional fuel storage, allowing a record flight of 1,300&nbsp;km (808&nbsp;mi) to be flown in 11 hours, 35 min on 20 April 1919.<ref name="Mikesh p269"/>  The Ro-go Ko-gata, along with licensed built [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.29]]s, replaced the obsolete pusher Farmans in Japanese Navy service, remaining in large scale service until 1926, being re-designated '''Yokosho-Type Reconnaissance Seaplane''' in 1923.{{ref label|Note2|b|b}}  Several were sold for civilian use, and were used to carry [[air-mail]] until 1928.<ref name="Mikesh p269"/><ref> "[http://www.goldenyears.ukf.net/reg_J-6.htm Civil Aircraft Register - Japan]".
