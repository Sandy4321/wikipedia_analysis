  
The '''Master of Computer Applications''' ('''MCA''') is a master's degree in computer science, which attracts people from a wide range of academic disciplines. The core courses of this program are designed to introduce students to the various areas of computer science and engineering such as  [[computer programming]], [[software engineering]], [[computer networking]],
[[database management]], [[computer graphics]] and [[systems analysis]]. The MCA designation originated in the India, emerging from the late 20th century as the country began its journey towards becoming an IT superpower and companies sought out information technology to business management. 

==Background==

In the Formative years of information technology industry in India, various computer science and engineering programmes were introduced in Indian universities. During 1980's universities like Pune and Delhi University began offering Master of Computer Applications as a three year professional degree in computer science to equip students with the various areas of computing and information technology. Later on this was followed by many institutes, universities and engineering colleges throughout India to meet the growing need of computer professionals in the country. In the early 2000's, the ministry of human resource development in India has decided to develop a nationwide entrance test for admission into MCA programme in various colleges and universities. The first All India MCA Common Entrance Test (AIMCET) was conducted in the 2004. However the AIMCET model was rejected by some universities offering this course and as a consequence no all India test has been conducted any more and every educational institution conducts its own test since 2005 for admission into MCA programme. 

===Accreditation===

The University grants commisson (UGC) India and all India council for technical education (AICTE) recognises MCA as a three year masters degree in computer science. The Universities offering MCA has to be recognised by UGC and Association of Indian Universities (AIU), whereas Institutes and engineering colleges offering this course has to be approved by AICTE. As per AICTE norms [[DOEACC]] B-level is taken as an equivalent to MCA, however several other programmes like post graduate diploma (PGDCA, PGDCM and PGDSEM), master of computer management (MCM), MBA (Systems management and Software enterprise management) are not considered as an equvalent to this course unless stated.

===Basic types of MCA programme===

'''Three year (Full Time) MCA''' programs normally take place over three academic years (i.e. approximately 36 months of term time with six semesters). Students take classes during weekdays like other university students and sit for semester examination twice a year. 

'''Integrated MCA''' programme is of five year duration. It consists of a 3 year BCA followed by a 2 year MCA.

'''Part Time MCA''' programs normally hold classes on weekday evenings, after normal working hours, or on weekends. Part-time programs normally last more than three years and in some cases maximum of six years. The students in these programs typically consist of working professionals who enter with a reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience.  

'''Distance learning MCA''' programs hold classes off-campus and is offered by many respectable universities like [[IGNOU]]. These programme require additional accreditation by the distance education council (DEC) and rated at par with full time MCA programme. 

'''DOEACC B-level''' programme is a three years diploma offered by DOEACC society (Govt. of India) which is considered as an '''MCA equivalent''' by Ministry of human resource development in India.

'''MCA (COM)''' or Master of Computer Application (Commerce) programme introduced by [[University of Pune]], is a blending of three areas viz, information systems, software product development and knowledge processing in commercial domain.

==Admission criteria==

Most programs base admission on an entrance test which includes basic computer skills, mathematics, reasoning and verbal ability. Some of the top universities like Pune University, Delhi University and JNU conduct their own tests. While others take CET scores as a standard. Admission into IIT Roorkee MCA programme is done through JAM. Universities and Institutes in West Bengal accept Joint Entrance for Computer Application (JECA) scores. Admission into this programme require a three year bachelors degree in any discipline (Arts/Scince/Commerce) and the candidate should have studied mathematics either at bachelors level or at 10+2/higher secondary level. MCA can also be obtained after a three years BCA degree. Candidates who have not studied mathematics at bachelors or 10+2 level but has adequate knowledge in mathematics can also apply for MCA programme in JNU, IGNOU and some other universities. IGNOU offers a preparatory course in mathematics for such cadidates, while other institutes provide extensive coursework in mathematics in the early semesters of the programme. A polytechnic diploma is not considered to be a bachelors degree and hence not sufficient to satisfy the elegibility requirement for this programme. However some universities/institutes offer MCA programme to such diploma holders provided that they have reasonable amount of prior real-world work experience.

==Programme content==
MCA programme is devided in six semesters to equip students with the various aspects of computer programming, operating systems, DBMS, networking, computer oriented numerical methods, theory of automata, compiler, fundamentals of electronics and digital systems, various programming languages, software engineering, software project management, computer aided software engineering, software quality assurance, etc.

In the final (in some cases prefinal) semester an MCA student takes a specialisation from a list of options. Most common options are [[Artificial Intelligence]], Bio informatics, Embeded systems, .NET technologies etc. In addition to this industrial training and internship is also offered to students by some institutes.

==MCA degree in Indian Universities==
Main article: [[List of Institutes and Univresities offering MCA degree]]

A number of Universities in India offer full time as well as part time MCA programme. Some of the top universities and institutes offering MCA are [[University of Pune]], [[Delhi University]], [[JNU]], JNTU, [[IIT Roorkee]], Indian Institute of Information Technology, etc. A handfull of universities like [[IGNOU]], [[Sikkim Manipal University]], [[NSOU]], Punjab Technical University etc. offer MCA through distance lerning mode as well. [[DOEACC]] has set up several study centers throughout India providing B-level diploma. Along with this hundreds of engineering colleges offer MCA courses nationwide.

==Career progression after MCA==

A candidate with an MCA degree can take various career paths in the information technology industry as well as ITES sector. In the corporate sector they can start their career as a programmer, software engineer, system analyst, DBMS administrator, systems manager, network professional, project engineer etc. while in the public sector they can work as IT officers in banks, defence services (including armed forces), intelligence agencies, computer forensics etc. In academics MCA's can work  as teachers, professors and researchers in computer science. After MCA a candidate can apply for higher studies through GATE/UGC NET examinations to obtain MTech or doctoral degrees in computer science.
