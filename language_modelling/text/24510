'''Harold E. "Butch" Woolfolk''' (born [[March 1]] [[1960]], in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]) is a former [[American football]] [[running back]] and [[kick returner]] who played in college for the [[University of Michigan]] (1978&ndash;1981) and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[New York Giants]] (1982&ndash;1984), [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] (1985-1986) and [[Detroit Lions]] (1987&ndash;1988). 

Woolfolk led Michigan in [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] three straight years and set the school record with 3,850 rushing yards while playing for the Wolverines from [[1978 NCAA Division I-A football season|1978]] to [[1981 NCAA Division I-A football season|1981]].  As a sophomore in 1979, he was the [[Big Ten Conference]] scoring champion, and he went on to become a a three-time first-team All-Big Ten selection.  He had his best season as a senior at Michigan, winning the 1981 Big Ten rushing title and fallling just 10&nbsp;yards short of [[Rob Lytle]]'s single-season rushing yards record.  He was also selected in 1981 as the [[Most Valuable Player]] of both the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] played [[January 1]], [[1981]], and the [[Bluebonnet Bowl]] played [[December 31]], [[1981]], as well as the Wolverines' team MVP for the season.  

Woolfolk also excelled in [[athletics (track and field)|track]].  He was named an [[All-American]] in 1980 and won nine Big Ten track and field championships both as a individual and [[relay race]] team member.  He continues to hold the Michigan outdoor 200-meter record.  He was also a member of relay teams that hold numerous U-M and [[Ferry Field]] all-time records. 

Woolfolk played seven seasons in the NFL.  As a rookie in 1982, he finished third in the NFL in [[all-purpose yards]].  And in 1983, he set an NFL record with 43 rushing attempts in a single game.  He was also fifth in the NFL in receptions in 1985.  Woolfolk was plagued with injuries during his NFL career and was able to play in 16 games only twice -- in 1983 and 1985.  In both of those years, he accumulated at least 1200&nbsp;[[yards from scrimmage]].  He also had seven 100-yard games&mdash;five receiving and two rushing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoolBu00_biggames.htm|title=Butch Woolfolk (big games)|accessdate=2008-01-20|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>

===253 yards rushing against Michigan State===
He began the 1981 season with five consecutive 100-yard games including a 253-yard effort.  Woolfolk's best game as a Wolverine was the [[October 10]][[1981]] contest against [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]]. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach [[Bo Schembechler]] said: "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran as much as the guy on the West Coast ([[Marcus Allen]]). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it."<ref>{{cite news|title=Workhorse Woolfolk Runs for 253 Yards|date=1981-10-1-|accessdate=2007-12-11|publisher=[[Detroit Free Press]]}}</ref> His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.<ref name=MFSAQP/>

===Relationship with Bo Schembechler===

During his four years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one reporter described as "a strange love-hate relationship" with Coach [[Bo Schembechler]].<ref name=WPWWSGG>{{cite news|title=Woolfolk provides Michigan with strong ground game|accessdate=2007-12-11|date=1981-11-19|publisher=Marysville Journal-Tribune (Ohio)}}</ref> Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a "tough coach," and it was "not easy at all" playing for him.<ref name=WPWWSGG/> Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk "came of age" in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first [[bowl game]] victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: "Butch can be a real load."<ref name=PSASWTW/> By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country."<ref name=WPWWSGG/> Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was "key" to his success: "He kept after me. He kept saying I was getting too fancy. He kept saying, 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'"<ref name=WPWWSGG/>

===Track and field===
While at Michigan, Woolfolk was also the 1980 [[Big Ten Conference]] track champion in the outdoor [[200m|200 meter]] and indoor 300 meter events.<ref name=BTRB>{{cite web|url=http://bigten.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/big10/genrel/auto_pdf/0708records-men-track|title=Big Ten Conference Records Book 2007-08: Men's Track and Field|accessdate=2008-01-05|date=2007|publisher=Big Ten Conference, Inc.}}</ref><!--I don't see the 300 meter event in the Big Ten record book--><ref name=WHOFM/><ref name=NYT120682>{{cite news|title=The Catch by Woolfolk|author=Anderson, Dave|accessdate=2007-12-11|date=1982-12-06|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> He also competed in the 200 meter event in the 1980 Olympic Trials.<ref name=NYT120682/>  Through the 2007 season his 1980 outdoor 200 meter time of 20.59&nbsp;seconds remains the all-time University of Michigan record.  His 1980 outdoor [[100m|100 meter]] time of 10.36, which is now the fourth fastest in Michigan history was once the school record, and his indoor 300 meter (event retired) time of 30.38, which is now the second fastest in Michigan history was also once a school record.<ref>{{cite book|title=Two Thousand Eight Michigan Men's Track and Field|editor=Hergott, Jeremiah|publisher=Frye Printing Compamy|year=2008}}</ref>  The 100m record and 300m record were broken by [[4x100m|4 x 100 meter]] [[relay race]] teammate Andrew Bruce in 1981 and 1982 respectively.<ref name=RB06>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/tfm-records-2006.pdf|title=The Record Book (through the 2006 season)|publisher=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>  The men's track and field team won the Big Ten indoor title in 1982, and they won the outdoor titles in 1980, 1981, 1982.<ref name=BigTenrecordbook>{{cite web|url=http://bigten.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/big10/genrel/auto_pdf/0708records-men-track|title=Big Ten Conference Records Book 2007-08: Men's Track and Field|accessdate=2007-11-12|date=2007|publisher=Big Ten Conference, Inc.}}</ref>  The 4 x 100 meter relay team won the Big Ten Conference championships in 1981 and 1982,<ref name=BTRB/> and their 1980 and 1982 times of 3:06.95 and 3:07.34 with Woolfolk running second and Bruce running [[Anchor (relay)|anchor]] are the 2nd  and 3rd fastest times in Michigan team history.<ref name=RB06/>  The 1980 relay time continues to be a [[Ferry Field]] stadium record.<ref name=RB06/>  Bruce and Woolfolk also are members of the Michigan team [[Medley relay|sprint medley]] record holding team (1982, 3:17.84).<ref name=RB06/>

==NFL career==
Woolfolk played three years in the NFL for the [[New York Giants]] (1982&ndash;1984), two years with the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] (1985&ndash;1987), and two years with the [[Detroit Lions]] (1987&ndash;1988).<ref name=PFRBW/>  He was a versatile player who accumulated nearly 5,000&nbsp;[[all-purpose yards]] and had seven 100-yard games, five as a receiver out of the backfield and two as a rusher.<ref name=BW>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoolBu00.htm|title=Butch Woolfolk|accessdate=2008-01-22|publisher= Sports Reference, LLC.|work= Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref><ref name=BWBG>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WoolBu00_biggames.htm|title=Butch Woolfolk (big games)|accessdate=2008-01-22|publisher= Sports Reference, LLC.|work= Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>  Three of his 100-yard games came as a Giant and four as an Oiler.<ref name=BWBG/>

===Offers from agents===
Woolfolk told the [[Associated Press|AP]] in 1982 of receiving offers of representation from some 50 agents while he was still in college. Woolfolk noted that he was offered under-the-table payments by agents while he was still in school, as well as cars, and even a job for his stepfather, William Johnson, a [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] dockworker. Woolfolk turned down those offers and signed with [[Jerry Argovitz]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Woolfolk Turned Down Lures to Land Top NFL Agent|date=1982-06-05|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=Casa Grande Dispatch (Ariz.)}}</ref>

===New York Giants===
Woolfolk was drafted by the Giants in the first round of the [[1982 NFL Draft]].<ref name=Bentley/><ref name=PFRBW>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/WoolBu00.htm|title=Pro-Football-Reference.com: Butch Woolfolk|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref> Woolfolk graduated from high school in New Jersey and was a Giants fan. He recalled watching the draft at his apartment in Ann Arbor: "When there were only four or five choices left before the Giants picked, I was hoping I'd last."<ref name=NYT120682/> 

In 1982, Woolfolk was named the NFC's Offensive Rookie of the Year, after appearing in nine games in which he rushed for 439 yards, caught 23 passes for 224 yards receiving and scored four touchdowns.<ref name=Intrepid>{{cite web|url=http://www.intrepidholdings.com/M-Woolfolk.htm|title=Harold "Butch" Woolfolk: General Manager, Community Allied Development|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=Intrepid Holdings, Inc.|date=2005}}</ref> In a December 1982 game against the Oilers, Woolfolk scored his first two NFL touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving, to help the Giants win, 17&ndash;14. With the Giants trailing and less then two minutes remaining in the game, Woolfolk scored on a 40&ndash;yard gain after making a leaping, one-handed catch. The next day, ''The [[New York Times]]'' published an article headlined, "The Catch By Woolfolk."<ref name=NYT120682/> The article concluded that with Woolfolk and [[Rob Carpenter]], the Giants "have their best backfield combination since the glory years of [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Alex Webster]] a quarter of a century ago."<ref name=NYT120682/>  Over the course of the season his 1,091 [[all-purpose yards]] was third to only [[James Brooks]] (1,383) and [[Marcus Allen]] (1,098).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1982/leaders.htm|title=1982 NFL Leaders and Leaderboards|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2008-01-05|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}</ref>
