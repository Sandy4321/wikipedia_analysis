"'''Showdown'''" is a two-part season finale of the American television sitcom, ''[[Cheers]]'', written by [[Glen and Les Charles]] and directed by [[James Burrows]]. It originally aired on [[NBC]] as separate Parts One and Two, respectively, on March 24 and 31, 1983. In the [[Give Me a Ring Sometime|''Cheers'' pilot]], college-educated [[Diane Chambers]] was neglected by her previous lover and then hired as a waitress by bartender [[Sam Malone]]. Since then, they have flirted and resisted each other throughout the whole season. In this episode, Sam's more successful brother, Derek, comes to Boston, cheers the whole crowd at the bar, and then charms Diane by sharing her common interests. Since then, Derek and Diane become an item, leaving Sam jealous. Later, Diane becomes torn between Derek and Sam. No longer able to keep feelings to themselves, Sam and Diane start to make out in the office, which concludes this season finale.

Initially, the original airings scored low [[Nielsen ratings]], but subsequent airings have improved the ratings. Moreover, its reruns aired three days before the show won five out of thirteen Emmy Award nominations, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|an Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]] that this episode earned, in the [[35th Primetime Emmy Awards|1983 Primetime Emmy Awards]] and one week before the second season premiered. Highlights of this episode from critical reception have been an [[unseen character|unseen appearance]] of Derek Malone and [[Sam and Diane]]'s [[cliffhanger]] kiss.

== Plot ==
=== Part One ===
Bartender [[Sam Malone]] ([[Ted Danson]]), as acknowledged, has been envious and jealous about Derek, who is more successful, highly educated, multi-talented, and handsome, for years. Then he discovers that Derek is arriving to [[Boston]] with his private jet. Meanwhile, co-bartender [[Coach (Cheers)|Coach]] ([[Nicholas Colasanto]]) is offered a coaching job that is in [[Venezuela]] and that requires communication in Spanish. Derek (an [[unseen character]], voiced by George Ball) suddenly arrives into the bar and entertains bar patrons with his talents, like singing, playing a [[billiard table|pool table]], [[tap dance|tap dancing]], and telling stories. Derek offers a job to a regular patron [[Norm Peterson|Norm]] ([[George Wendt]]), teaches Coach a Spanish language, which increases Coach's chances to get hired, and impresses waitress [[Diane Chambers|Diane]] ([[Shelley Long]]) by sharing her common interests. Later then, Diane and Derek become a couple, which bothers Sam, and then travel together at his own private jet for a date.

=== Part Two ===
A week later, Norm is fired from his own job, where the corporation has committed [[tax fraud]], for "[taking] a long lunch". (Norm dubs himself as the only "honest man" of the corporation, for which he considers the reason of his termination.) As heard on the phone, Coach does not have a coaching job, which was already given to someone else, putting his Spanish language to waste. Meanwhile, Sam dates other women but is still bothered by the relationship of Diane and Derek. Diane arrives to the bar after her trip with Derek and then confesses to Coach that she is torn between her ideal mate Derek, who becomes committed to her, and her "bubblegum" Sam. Coach insists that Sam has feelings but cannot express them very well. Then Diane informs Sam that she and Derek will be leaving right away for another trip, and then Sam fires her from waitressing.

After she goes back and forth several times saying her farewells to everyone in the bar, Diane then comes back into the office and then accidentally hits Sam's nose by opening the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam would come out of the office to say something to her. Then they argue, then confess each other's feelings for another, and then admit that Sam's and Diane's own individual relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Nevertheless, Sam and Diane attempt to make out and to maturely conversate each other without success, and then they argue again with boiling furies. Then Diane dubs Sam as the "best thing" in her life, while Sam says the oppose about her. Then they both rapidly say negative comments about each other, command each other, and then, at the end, give each other a passionate kiss.

In September 1983, Rick Sherwood from a syndicated news agency praised this episode's handling of its "[[sibling rivalry]]" theme, which was previously done in other shows, as "fresh", sophisticated, and old-fashioned.<ref name=sherwood>{{cite news|author=Sherwood, Rick|date=September 15, 1983|accessdate=June 28, 2012|issn=0163-402X|title=''Cheers'' episode is charming|page=5C|newspaper=[[Wilmington Morning Star]]|location=[[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], [[North Carolina]]|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7jhOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ghMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6811%2C3977979}} Rick Sherwood's article appears in other newspapers, according to Google search results.</ref> The Part Two of this episode earned [[James Burrows]] an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series|Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series]] in the [[35th Primetime Emmy Awards|1983 Primetime Emmy Awards]]<ref>Bjorklund, p. 457.</ref><ref name=emmys>{{cite web|work=Emmys.com|title=''Cheers''|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/cheers|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for the "Comedy Series" in 1984,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/Awards/History/1980s/1983.aspx|title=36th Annual DGA Awards: Honoring Outstanding Directorial Achievement for 1983|accessdate=June 28, 2012|date=1984|work=[[Directors Guild of America Award]]}}</ref> along with other directing crew.<ref name=DGAwins>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041128184035/http://stage.dga.org/thedga/aw_tv80s.php3|title=1980s - DGA Award Winners for: Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Television|url=http://stage.dga.org/thedga/aw_tv80s.php3|archivedate=November 28, 2004 by ''[[Internet Archive]] [[Wayback Machine]]''|work=[[Directors Guild of America Award]]|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> In the same annual Emmy Awards, this episode as a whole earned graphic designers, James Castle and Brucy Bryant, an Outstanding Individual Achievement of Graphic Design and Title Sequences.<ref>Bjorklund, p. 458.</ref><ref name=emmys/>

Cory Barker from the ''TV Surveillance'' website found this two-part season finale's romantic storyline "gimmicky", overfocused, and poorly executed, as well as its subplots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvsurveillance.com/2011/08/02/surveillance-summer-watch-cheers-showdown-parts-one-and-two/|date=August 2, 2011|title=Surveillance Summer Watch: Season Finale &mdash; ''Cheers'', "Showdown" Parts One and Two|accessdate=June 29, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftvsurveillance.com%2F2011%2F08%2F02%2Fsurveillance-summer-watch-cheers-showdown-parts-one-and-two%2F&date=2012-06-29|work=TV Surveillance|archivedate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> Freelance writer Robert David Sullivan in his blog ranked Part Two of this episode No. 96 on his top 100 favorite episodes of all time. He then highlighted the [[cliffhanger]] kiss as a "landmark" and as an impact to growing uses of cliffhangers in sitcoms and the sibling storyline as a cheap ploy to bring [[Sam and Diane]] together.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 20, 2012|work=Robert David Sullivan|title=Top 100 sitcom episodes of all time, No. 96: "Showdown (Part II)", Cheers|url=http://robertdavidsullivan.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/01/top-100-sitcom-episodes-of-all-time-no-96-showdown-part-ii-cheers.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Frobertdavidsullivan.typepad.com%2Fmy_weblog%2F2012%2F01%2Ftop-100-sitcom-episodes-of-all-time-no-96-showdown-part-ii-cheers.html&date=2012-06-29|archivedate=June 29, 2012 by ''[[WebCite]]''}}</ref> Lisa M.
