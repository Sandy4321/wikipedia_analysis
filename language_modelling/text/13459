'''Maria Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie''' (born '''Maria Sk<U+0142>odowska'''; known in [[France]] as '''Marie Curie''', [[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|aka]] '''Madame Curie''';   
[[November 7]], [[1867]] &ndash; [[July 4]] [[1934]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]]-[[France|French]] [[physicist]] and [[chemist]].  She was a pioneer in the field of [[radioactivity]], the first twice-honored [[Nobel laureate]] (and still today the only laureate in two different sciences), and the first female professor at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].
{{TOCleft}}   

She was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], to [[Poles|Polish]] parents and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she went to [[Paris]], [[France]], to study science. She obtained her higher degrees and conducted nearly all her scientific work there, and became a [[naturalization|naturalize]]d [[France|French]] citizen. She founded the [[Curie Institute]]s in [[Paris]], [[France]], and in her home town, [[Warsaw]], in resurrected [[Poland]].

==Life==
[[Image:Mc-birthplace.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Birthplace of Maria Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie in [[Warsaw]]'s "[[Warsaw New Town|New Town]]."]]

Born in [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland]], her early years were marked by the death of her sister (from [[typhus]]) and, four years later, the death of her mother. In her youth Sk<U+0142>odowska was known for her exceptional memory and diligent [[work ethic]] and was known to neglect food and even sleep to study. She graduated from [[high school]] at the top of her class at age fifteen. <ref name="mhlanas.de">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Physics/Bios/MarieCurie.html|title=Marie Curie|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

Because she was female, and because of [[Russia]]n reprisals following the Polish [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]] against [[Tsarist Russia]], Sk<U+0142>odowska was denied admission to a regular university. She worked for several years as a governess while attending [[Warsaw]]'s illegal [[Flying University]]. Eventually, with financial help from her elder sister Bronis<U+0142>awa, she moved to [[Paris]]. 

Sk<U+0142>odowska attended high school at the [[Coll<U+00E8>ge S<U+00E9>vign<U+00E9>]], then studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] (later becoming the Sorbonne's first female professor).  In early 1893, she graduated first in her undergraduate class. A year later, also at the Sorbonne, she obtained her [[master's degree]] in mathematics. In 1903, under the  supervision of [[Henri Becquerel]], she received her [[DSc]] from the [[ESPCI]], Paris, becoming the first woman in France to complete a doctorate.

At the Sorbonne, she met and married [[Pierre Curie]], a fellow-instructor. Together they studied [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials, particularly [[pitchblende]] <U+2014> the [[ore]] from which [[uranium]] was extracted <U+2014> which had the curious property of being more radioactive than the uranium extracted from it. By 1898 they had deduced that the pitchblende must contain traces of an unknown radioactive substance far more radioactive than uranium.  On [[December 26]], [[1898]], Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie announced the existence of this substance.

Through several years' unceasing work, they processed several tons of [[uraninite|pitchblende]], progressively concentrating the radioactive substances and eventually isolating the chloride salts (refining [[radium chloride]] on [[April 20]], [[1902]]) and identifying two new [[chemical element]]s. The first, they named "[[polonium]]," after Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie's native country, Poland, and the other "[[radium]]," for its intense [[radioactivity]]. 
[[Image:Dyplom Sklodowska.jpg|200px|thumb|One of Maria Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie's two [[Nobel Prize]] diplomas.]]

In 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded [[Pierre Curie]], Marie Curie, and [[Henri Becquerel]] the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] phenomena discovered by Professor [[Henri Becquerel]]."  

Curie was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize. Eight years later, she received the 1911 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element". 

In an unusual decision, Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie intentionally refrained from [[patent]]ing the radium-isolation process, leaving it open so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. A month after accepting her 1911 Nobel Prize, she was hospitalized with depression and a kidney ailment. Whenever she felt especially depressed, she went to the [[countryside]] to relax.

She was the first person to win or share ''two'' Nobel Prizes. She is one of only two people who have been awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in two different fields, the other being [[Linus Pauling]] (Chemistry, Peace).  She remains the only woman to have won two Nobel Prizes.

After her husband's 1906 death in a street accident, she reputedly had an affair with physicist [[Paul Langevin]] <U+2014> a married man who had left his wife <U+2014> which resulted in a press scandal, taken advantage of by her academic opponents to damage her credibility. Despite her fame as a scientist working for [[France]], the public's attitude to the scandal tended toward [[xenophobia]]. Langevin's grandson Michel later married her granddaughter, [[H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Langevin-Joliot]].

During [[World War I]], she pushed for the use of mobile [[radiography]] units, "Little Curies" (''petites Curies''), for the treatment of wounded soldiers.  These units were powered using tubes of ''radium emanation'', a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as [[radon]].  Marie personally provided the tubes, derived from the radium she purified.  Also, promptly after the war started, she donated her and her husband's gold [[Nobel Prize]] [[medal]]s for the war effort.

In 1921, she toured the [[United States]], where she was welcomed triumphantly, to raise funds for research on radium.

In her later years, she was disappointed by the many physicians and makers of [[cosmetics]] who used [[radioactive]] material without precautions.

Her death near [[Sallanches]] in 1934 was from [[aplastic anemia]], almost certainly due to exposure to radiation, as the damaging effects of hard radiation were not yet known, and much of her work had been carried out in a shed with no safety measures being taken. She carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket and stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the pretty blue-green light the substances gave off in the dark.

She was initially buried at the cemetery in [[Sceaux]], where Pierre lay, but in 1995, to honor their work, their ashes were transferred to the [[Panth<U+00E9>on, Paris|Panth<U+00E9>on]].

Their eldest daughter, [[Ir<U+00E8>ne Joliot-Curie]], won a [[Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry in 1935. Her youngest daughter, [[Eve Curie]], wrote the biography, ''Madame Curie'', after her mother's death.

==Prizes==

*[[Davy Medal]] ([[1903]])
*[[Matteucci Medal]] ([[1904]])
*[[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] ([[1911]])

==Tribute==
As one of the most famous female scientists to date, Marie Curie has been an icon in the scientific world and has inspired many tributes and recognitions. In 1995, she was the first and only woman laid to rest under the famous dome of the [[The Panth<U+00E9>on|Panth<U+00E9>on]], in Paris, on her own merits, alongside her husband. The [[curie]] (symbol '''Ci'''), a unit of radioactivity, is named in their honour, as is the element with atomic number 96 - [[curium]].

Sk<U+0142>odowska-Curie's likeness appeared on the Polish late-[[1980s]] [[inflation]]ary  
[[Historical coins and banknotes of Poland|20,000-z<U+0142>oty banknote]]. Her likeness also appeared on stamps and coins, and on the last French 500-[[<U+20A3>|franc]] note, with her husband, before the [[F|franc]] was made obsolete by the [[euro]].

[[Greer Garson]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] starred in the 1943 U.S. Oscar-nominated film, ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', based on her life. "Marie Curie" is also the name of a character in the 1988 comedy, ''[[Young Einstein]]'', by [[Yahoo Serious]].

Three radioactive minerals are named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite.

[[University_of_Paris_VI:_Pierre_et_Marie_Curie|Pierre and Marie Curie University]], the largest science, technology and medicine university in France, and successor institution to the faculty of science at the [[University of Paris]], where she taught, is named in honour of her and Pierre.  The university is home to the laboratory where they discovered [[radium]]. Another school named for her, Marie Curie [[M.S.158]], in Bayside, New York, specializes in [[science]] and [[technology]].
