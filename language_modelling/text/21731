The '''Reynolds-Sorgi Incident''' refers to an American [[College football]] in-game incident in which [[Ohio State Buckeyes]] linebacker [[Robert Reynolds (football player)|Robert Reynolds]] appeared to choke [[Wisconsin Badgers]] quarterback [[Jim Sorgi]], injuring Sorgi's [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], after the play had been whistled dead.  Sorgi was unable to play for the remainder of the game, struggling to breathe and unable to speak.

==The game==
On [[October 11]], [[2003]], the Buckeyes entered the game as the defending national champions, ranked #3 in the country and on a 19-game winning streak with a record of 5-0.  The unranked Badgers came into the game at 5-1, having lost at home to UNLV.  The Badgers were without star running back Anthony Davis, who was recovering from a fractured eye-socket caused by a late-hit.  The game was played at the Badgers' home [[Camp Randall|Camp Randall Stadium]].

Midway through the third quarter, Sorgi scrambled for an 8 yard gain before being brought down by a convergence of OSU tacklers.  After the play was called dead, Reynolds crushed Sorgi's throat with his hand as Sorgi lay on his back.  Sorgi<U+2019>s vocal cords were bruised, he had a hard time breathing, and he was unable to speak.  He would not return to the game.  Reynolds' intentions were unclear.  Reynolds was not whistled for a foul.  The Badgers came back to win the game.

After the game, [[Big Ten]] commissioner [[James Delany]] commented, "(Reynolds' actions) have no place in our game." [http://www.centralohio.com/ohiostate/stories/20031014/football/451115.html].  Buckeyes coach [[Jim Tressel]] said "Robert's conduct was totally unacceptable and has no place in intercollegiate athletics."  Ohio State suspended Reynolds for one game and Reynolds issued a public apology.
