'''Vassilios Tsiartas''' is a former [[Greece|Greek]] football player, revered by many as one of the most naturally talented [[Greece|Greek]] footballers of his generation.  Tsiartas was born on [[November 12]]th, [[1972]] in [[Alexandria, Greece]] and currently resides in [[Athens]]. As a player he was famed for his lackadaisical playing style; his ability, however, was never in question and he was in many ways the epitome of a player who wears the ''number 10 shirt''. Tsiartas was predominantly [[Laterality|left footed]] but was just as dangerous with his right. He was a phenomenal [[free kick]] specialist and also took all [[Penalty kick|penalties]] for the [[Greece national football team|National Team of Greece]] and his club sides. He was an important part of the Greek National Side with two assists for the team that qualified for [[Euro 2004]] and later would go on to win the tournament as 100-1 outsiders. In his entire career he did not receive a single red card.

==Club career==
He began his career at the academy at AE Alexandris and later the team of F.A.S. Naoussa FC which also produced such players as Yiotis Tsalouchidis and [[Dimitris Markos]]. The left footed attacking [[midfielder]] soon made a name for himself and his subsequent move to [[AEK Athens FC]] resulted in him scoring the most goals in the 1996 season in the [[Alpha Ethniki]] (A League). This and his huge attacking presence lead to a move to [[Sevilla FC]] where he was an influential captain and vital in team gaining promotion to the [[La Liga|Primera Division]]. He was known in Sevilla as 'El Mago' due to his lethal ability with any free kicks combined with a powerful shot in or outside the box. He returned to AEK Athens FC in 2000 and after another successful 4 year spell at AEK he ended his career at [[FC K<U+00F6>ln]]. Tsiartas officially returned to active competition by signing with [[Ethnikos Piraeus]] in [[Greece]]. On [[February 14]], [[2007]] Vasilis Tsiartas announced his retirement from professional [[football]][http://www.contra.gr/Soccer/Hellas/142570.html]

==International career==
Having played U-16 and U-21 he debuted for the [[Greece national football team|Greek National Team]] on [[April 27]] [[1994]] in a game against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. He managed to score 12 goals (5 of which were penalties) in his 70 caps with the National Team including an important penalty against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in [[2003]] which led to Greece's qualification for [[Euro 2004]]. During the [[Euro 2004]] he was used mainly as a substitute by the team's coach [[Otto Rehhagel]], but managed to claim two vital assists, one against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPwblKjm2lo] and the other against the [[Czech Republic]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cYtmCzFU3w] on the way to [[Euro 2004#Final|Greece's victory]] in the tournament.
