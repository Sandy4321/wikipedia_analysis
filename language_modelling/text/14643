It was founded in 1952.

==History==
Pearl was founded by Katsumi Yanagisawa, who began manufacturing music stands in [[Sumida, Tokyo]] on April 2, 1946. In 1950 Katsumi shifted his focus to the manufacturing of [[drum]]s and named his company "Pearl Industry, Ltd."

By 1953, the company's name had changed to "Pearl Musical Instrument Company," and manufacturing had expanded to include drum kits, marching drums, [[timpani]], Latin percussion instruments, [[cymbal]]s, stands, and accessories.

Katsumi's eldest son, Mitsuo, joined Pearl in 1957 and formed a division to export Pearl products worldwide. To meet increasing worldwide demand for drum kits following the advent of [[Rock and Roll]] music, in 1961 Pearl built a {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} factory in [[Chiba, Chiba|Chiba]], Japan to produce inexpensive drum kits which bore the brand names of over thirty distributors like Maxwin, CB-700, Crest, Revelle, Revere, Lyra, Majestic, Whitehall, Apollo, Toreador, Roxy, and Coronet.<ref>[http://www.pearldrum.com/education/history/default.asp Pearl - The Best Reason To Play Drums<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1965, Mitsuo formulated a long-range plan to bring Pearl to the forefront of the percussion industry. Under this plan, Pearl would 1) develop new products with quality equal to or better than products offered by established brand name companies; 2) install the latest automated machinery in the China factory to increase production; 3) establish a sister factory in [[Taiwan]]; and 4) establish a worldwide sales and service network.

As part of this plan, Pearl introduced their first professional drum kit; the "President Series," in 1966, and in 1973, the Pearl Musical Instrument Company of Taiwan became operational.

Today, Pearl's Taiwanese operation encompasses five factories whose output supplies nearly the entire worldwide market for Pearl products. The original Chiba factory now caters to the domestic Japanese market producing drum kits, marching drums, timpani, and symphonic chimes.

[[Adams Musical Instruments]] are sold in the U.S. through Pearl dealers, [[Hughes and Kettner]] guitar and bass amplifiers are distributed through Pearl's main warehouse in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Sabian (company)|Sabian]] cymbals are distributed in Japan through Pearl dealers.

Pearl pioneered various bold and inventive drum products, shells in the 70's were made of a composite called "wood fibreglass." Additionally, Pearl combined roto-toms and these wood-fiber shells to create the vari-pitch line of drums. Other early innovations included shells that were slightly undersized, so that the drumhead would extend over the edges much like a gong drum. Pearl manufactured seamless, extruded acrylic shells that were different to the tabbed-and-seamed vistalite shells used by [[Ludwig]].  Pearl also developed the hinged tube tom-arm: a design widely copied by many other drum manufacturers.

Gene Okamoto cemented his reputation as a very supportive and amiable person to deal with from both artists and Pearl customers (sometimes through Pearl's online forum) alike.

==Construction==
Pearl has always been known as a company that made drum shells first and foremost. They made shells for more than 30 companies. In the 1960s, they ceased making shells for other companies, and began manufacturing drums under their own name and used the Pearl logo for the first time.<ref>[http://www.pearldrum.com/03_nuupdts/edu/products/pearlhistoryvideo.html Pearl's History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Pearl makes all of their drums in their own factories, there is no outsourcing. Pearl have recently started manufacturing their drums in China.<ref>[http://www.pearldrum.com/03_nuupdts/edu/products/pearlqualityvideo.html Pearl's Commitment to Quality<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Their construction technique is known as SST or "Superior Shell Technology." All Pearl drums feature this construction. Each ply is placed into a cylinder, and pressure is applied from both sides. While in the press, the shell is heated to bring the glue to a boil, thus forcing it through the wood grain and fusing the shells very tightly. The individual plies are scarf jointed, and all the seams are offset, resulting in a "seamless" drum (Pearl demonstrates the strength by parking a [[Humvee]] with its tire on a tom shell).<ref>[http://www.pearldrum.com/03_nuupdts/edu/products/hcsmsvideo.html Heat Compression Shell Molding System<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This creates a drum shell of incredible strength.

==Pearl's drum kit line==
Pearl's current line of drum kits includes eight series, ranging from entry level to professional grade, all of them use Pearl's heat compression SST system on the plies. In ascending order, they are:
=== Current Line ===
* '''Rhythm Traveler''' <U+2013> a traveler's kit. All drums in the kit feature shrunken depths. Package includes cymbals, throne, [[drum hardware|hardware]], mesh [[drum head|head]]s and [[cymbal]] [[mute]]s. Rhythm Traveler drums are made with 6 [[ply|plies]] (7.5&nbsp;mm) of "Selected Hardwoods".
* '''Target''' <U+2013> Manufactured for the [[Europe]]an market, and sold as a complete set with cymbals, throne, hardware and drumsticks. Drums are made with 6 plies of Basswood. 
* '''Forum''' <U+2013> Made with 6 plies (7.5&nbsp;mm) of [[Poplar]]. Upgraded in January 2008 to FZ - now featuring upgrades like ISS mounting.{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}}
* '''Vision''' - Introduced in 2007, these drums are the replacement for the now-discontinued Export and Session series drums. Vision drums originally came in 2 varieties: the VLX Lacquer finish drums, and the VSX Covered finish drums. The shell material is Birch and [[Basswood]]. 6 ply toms: 1 inner ply birch, 4 interior plies basswood, 1 outer ply birch. 8 ply floor toms and kick drums: 2 inner plies birch, 4 interior plies basswood, 2 outer plies birch. These drums are made in China, and also feature new lugs and come with the new 900 series hardware. These were meant to replace the Export drums. In 2008, Pearl introduced new varieties: the VBX with all birch shells and the VMX with all maple shells, and with the birch/basswood shells stopped producing the VLX, but have kept the VSX and also have a new line, the VX, which has Export-style wrapped finishes.
* '''Masters Custom''' - Introduced in 2007 they offer shells of 6-ply [[maple wood|maple]]. These drums are the replacement for the entire Session line, and have a few differences from the Session kits: They feature Die Cast hoops, Masters-series lugs, and [[Remo]] drumheads. They are the same configuration as the Masters Premium MRP kits--but only come with 5 finishes and the only available hardware color is bright chrome. As a result the drums are not made up as "custom" stock, so they are warehoused in large quantities, and the time between order and delivery is much shorter.
* '''Masters Premium''' <U+2013> Released in January 2007, Masters Premium are 4 lines within this series consisting of, MMP, MRP, BRP, and BMP; they replace the Masters Series. MMP drums feature 4 plies(5.0&nbsp;mm) of maple with maple reinforcement rings. MRP drums feature 6 plies(7.5&nbsp;mm) of maple. BMP drums feature 4 plies(5.0&nbsp;mm) of [[birch]] with reinforcement rings. BRP drums feature 6 plies (7.5&nbsp;mm) of birch. All series offer the choice of either [[chrome]], black-chrome, or [[brass]] hardware. [http://namm.harmony-central.com/WNAMM03/Content/Pearl/PR/Masters-Diamond-Burst-lg.jpg]
* '''Reference''' - Released in January 2006. Pearl has blended wood types (maple, birch and [[mahogany]]) together for the toms, [[snare drum]]s, and [[bass drum]]s. They are the highest quality that Pearl offers that are not totally custom-made. As of 2008, 27 finishes are available, with either chrome, black or [[gold]]-plated hardware. 8" and 10" Toms are 4 outer plies of Maple with 2 inner plies of Birch. 12" Toms are 6 plies of Maple...the only single wood origin drum in the lineup.
* '''Masterworks''' <U+2013> Pearl's flagship model, hand made drums. Everything including the plies of wood (mahogany, maple, birch, [[carbon fiber]]/maple are some of the models), style and finish of hardware (chrome, 24k gold, black), and finish can be selected by the customer.  For an added cost, Masterworks drums can be ordered with an exotic wood outer ply (such as tamo or bubinga) which enhances the finish.[http://www.poweralley.com/Pearl/mwrootbeer.jpg] Delivery times can run six months.

=== Discontinued ===
* '''Export (EX,ELX,EXR,ECX)''' - Pearl's most popular series of drum kits, also the most popular set ever sold (the one millionth Export kit was produced in 1995). The latest generation of Export drums were made with 6 plies (7.5&nbsp;mm) of Poplar, and come standard with Pearl's ISS suspension mounting system. The ECX series are made from maple. In January 2008, Pearl discontinued these drums in favor of the new Vision series.
* '''Session''' - Session drums were made from 100% Maple or Birch shells depending on which the customer chose; both were 6-ply (7.5&nbsp;mm). Session drums came standard with the Optimount suspension system and 2.3&nbsp;mm Superhoops. The series was discontinued in January 2008.
* '''Masters''' - Forerunner to the Masters Premium.  Shells in Maple (MMX, MRX, MSX), Birch (MBX, BRX)and Mahogany (MHX).  Most finishes are now available on Masters Premium and/or Reference.
* '''MX, MLX & BLX''' - Preceded original Masters series, with the MX being a wrapped 6ply maple kit, and the MLX and BLX being lacquered 6ply Maple and Birch Kits respectively. Included 2.3&nbsp;mm Superhoops, through-shell mounting and often came with a steel free-floating snare.
* '''World Series''' - Kits placed between the Exports and MLX & BLX kits, over their time had various shell compositions, came in both wrapped and lacquered models.

===Limited Edition===
Over the years, Pearl has released a number of limited edition kits, normally special versions of existing lines:
* '''Redline''' - Redline kits are finished in either solid black or solid white, with matching black or white lugs/hoops etc.  The rubber gaskets on the lugs and bass drum claws were dyed red, hence the name.  Black and white kits came in different size shellpacks.  At NAMM 2008, Redline Reference series were released to the US market - Redline MMP kits were released to Europe at the Musikmesse later that year.
* '''50th Anniversary''' - Original Masters Series, 4 ply birch with reinforcement rings.  24 carat gold- plated lugs.  Only 30 kits were made - 10 in Wine Red, 10 in Black Mist, 10 in Emerald Mist. Kits were not sold in the US - only Anniversary style snares, although these single snares were of higher quality than the snare drums that came with the Anniversary kits.
* '''Chad Smith & Joey Jordison limited edition''' - These kits were released before as an Export kit shell pack. The Joey Jordison kit consist of two bass drum, three toms, two floor toms and a Joey Jordison signature snare.

==Chad Smith's prototype kit and tattoo kit==
Pearl and CeeLite created a drum kit for [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Chad Smith]], incorporating CeeLite's lighting technology to illuminate his Pearl Masters kit on stage. The kit was wrapped with Cee-Lite's flat, flexible Light Emitting Capacitor (LEC) panels which can be programmed to dim, fade and flash. The kit features 6 ply 7.5&nbsp;mm 100% aged maple shells with chrome hardware.
This drum kit uses a Flatline Inverter which shines at 25% brightness throughout the duration of the set. When the drum is struck, the brightness will increase to 100% and decrease back down to 25%. Flash durations also range from 0.2 to 0.4 seconds in order for the illumination to be in sync with 1/16 and 1/32 drum rolls.

Chad first played this kit on [[NBC]]'s [[Saturday Night Live]] on 5-6-06, and used this kit on the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] 2006 & 2007 tours.

In 2008 an unlaquered Pearl Masters Premium kit was fully Tattooed by the dutch Tattoo master Henk Schiffmacher. This kit was given to Chad Smith to tour with.

==Snare Drums==
As well as drum kits, Pearl is a renowned producer of snare drums. Lower end kits (Vision series and lower) come standard with snare drums, and higher end series have snares which must be bought separately. Individual snares, as well as artists' signature snares, are also available.
