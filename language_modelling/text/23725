'''''Pteranodon''''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|t|<U+0268>|<U+02C8>|r|<U+00E6>|n|<U+0259>|d|<U+0252>|n}}; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] <U+03C0><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03C1>- "wing" and [[privative alpha|<U+03B1><U+03BD>]]-<U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03C9><U+03BD> "toothless") is a [[genus]] of [[pterosaur]]s which included some of the largest known flying [[reptile]]s, with wingspans over {{convert|6|m|ft}}. It existed  during the late [[Cretaceous]] geological period of [[North America]] in present day [[Kansas]], [[Alabama]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[South Dakota]]. More [[fossil]] specimens of ''Pteranodon'' have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons. It was an important part of the animal community  in the [[Western Interior Seaway]].<ref name=bennett2000/>

''Pteranodon'' was a reptile, but not a [[dinosaur]]. By definition, all dinosaurs belong  to the groups [[Saurischia]] and [[Ornithischia]], which exclude pterosaurs. Nevertheless, ''Pteranodon'' is frequently featured in dinosaur books and is strongly associated with dinosaurs by the general public.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/>

==Description==
''Pteranodon'' species are extremely well represented in the fossil record, allowing for detailed descriptions of their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes both male and female specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/>

===Size===
[[Image:Pteranodon scale.png|thumb|left|Size of ''P. longiceps'' male (green) and female (orange) compared with a human]]
Adult ''Pteranodon'' specimens from the two major species can be divided into two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider than those of the much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably  allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display. 

Adult male ''Pteranodon'' were among the largest pterosaurs, and were the largest flying reptiles known until the late 20th Century, when the giant [[azhdarchid]] pterosaurs were discovered.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/> The wingspan of an average adult male ''Pteranodon'' was {{convert|5.6|m|ft}}. Adult females were much smaller, averaging  {{convert|3.8|m|ft}} in wingspan. The largest specimen of ''Pteranodon longiceps'' from the [[Niobrara Formation]] measured {{convert|6.25|m|ft}} from wingtip to wingtip. An even larger specimen is known from the [[Pierre Shale Formation]], with a wingspan of {{convert|7.25|m|ft}}, though this specimen may belong to the distinct genus and species ''[[Geosternbergia maysei]]''.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara>Bennett, S.C. (1994). "The Pterosaurs of the Niobrara Chalk." ''The Earth Scientist'', '''11'''(1): 22-25.</ref> While most specimens are found crushed, enough fossils exist to put together a detailed description of the animal.

Methods used to estimate the weight of large male ''Pteranodon'' specimens (those with wingspans of about 7 meters) have been notoriously unreliable, producing a wide range of estimates from as low as {{convert|20|kg|lbs}} and as high as {{convert|93|kg|lbs}}. In a review of pterosaur size estimates published in 2010, researchers Mark Witton and Mike Habib demonstrated that the latter, largest estimates are almost certainly incorrect given the total volume of a ''Pteranodon'' body, and could only be correct if the animal "was principally {{sic|hide=y|comprised |of}} [[aluminium]]."<ref name=flight_size/> Witton and Habib considered the methods used by researchers who obtained smaller weight estimates equally flawed. Most have been produced by scaling modern animals such as bats and birds up to ''Pteranodon'' size, despite the fact that pterosaurs have vastly different body proportions and soft tissue anatomy than any living animal.<ref name=flight_size/>

===Skull and beak===
[[Image:Pteranodon longiceps YPM1177.jpg|thumb|Short crested ''P. longiceps'' holotype specimen YPM1177, now interpreted as a female individual]]
Unlike earlier pterosaurs such as ''[[Rhamphorhynchus (pterosaur)|Rhamphorhynchus]]'' and ''[[Pterodactylus]]'', ''Pteranodon'' had toothless [[beak]]s, similar to those of modern [[bird]]s. ''Pteranodon'' beaks were made of solid, bony margins that projected from the base of the jaws. The beaks were long, slender, and ended in thin, sharp points. The upper jaw was longer than the lower jaw. The upper jaw was curved upward; while this normally has been attributed only to the upward-curving beak, one specimen (UALVP 24238) has a curvature corresponding with the beak widening towards the tip. While the tip of the beak is not known in this specimen, the level of curvature suggests it would have been extremely long. The unique form of the beak in this specimen lead [[Alexander Kellner]] to assign it to a distinct genus, ''[[Dawndraco]]'', in 2010.<ref name=kellner2010>{{Cite journal|author=Kellner, A.W.A. |year=2010 |title=Comments on the Pteranodontidae (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea) with the description of two new species |url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/aabc/v82n4/25.pdf |journal=''Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ci<U+00EA>ncias |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=1063<U+2013>1084 |doi=10.1590/S0001-37652010000400025 }}</ref>

The most distinctive characteristic of ''Pteranodon'' is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The size and shape of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male ''Pteranodon sternbergi'', the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus ''[[Geosternbergia]]''), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, ''Pteranodon longiceps'', evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest.<ref name=bennett2000/> Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests.<ref name=bennett1994/> The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.<ref name=bennett1992/>

===Skeleton===
[[File:Pteranodon skeletal.jpg|thumb|upright|Skeletal reconstruction of a female ''P. longiceps'']] 
Other distinguishing characteristics that set ''Pteranodon'' apart from other pterosaurs include narrow [[neural spine]]s on the vertebrae, plate-like bony ligaments strengthening the vertebrae above the hip, and a relatively short tail in which the last few vertebrae are fused into a long rod.<ref name=bennett1987>Bennett, S. C. (1987). "New evidence on the tail of the pterosaur ''Pteranodon'' (Archosauria: Pterosauria)." Pp. 18<U+2013>23 in Currie, P. J. and E. H. Koster (eds.), Fourth Symposium on Mesozoic Terrestrial Ecosystems, Short Papers. Occasional Papers of the Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, #3.</ref> The entire length of the tail was about 3.5% as long as the wingspan, or up to {{convert|25|cm|in}} in the largest males.<ref name=bennett1987/>

==Timespan and evolution==
''Pteranodon'' fossils are known primarily from the [[Niobrara Formation]] of the central [[United States]]. Broadly defined, ''Pteranodon'' existed for more than four million years, during the late [[Coniacian]] to early [[Campanian]] stages of the [[Cretaceous]] period.<ref name=bennett1994>{{Cite journal | author = Bennett, S.C. | year = 1994 | title = Taxonomy and systematics of the Late Cretaceous pterosaur ''Pteranodon'' (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloida) | url = | journal = Occasional Papers of the Natural History Museum, University of Kansas | volume = 169 | issue = | pages = 1<U+2013>70 }}</ref> The genus is present in most layers of the Niobrarra Formation except for the upper two; in 2003, [[Kenneth Carpenter]] surveyed the distribution and dating of fossils in this formation, demonstrating that ''Pteranodon sternbergi'' existed there from 88 to 85 million years ago, while ''P. longiceps'' existed between 86 and 84.5 million years ago. A possible third species, which Kellner named ''[[Geosternbergia|Geosternbergia maysei]]'' in 2010, is known from the Sharon Springs member of the [[Pierre Shale Formation]] in Kansas, [[Wyoming]], and [[South Dakota]], dating to between 81.5 and 80.5 million years ago.<ref name=carpenter2003>Carpenter, K. (2003). "Vertebrate Biostratigraphy of the Smoky Hill Chalk (Niobrara Formation) and the Sharon Springs Member (Pierre Shale)." ''High-Resolution Approaches in Stratigraphic Paleontology'', '''21''': 421-437. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4020-9053-0}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Bennett noted that the two major [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]] of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were precisely separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent ''[[chronospecies]]'' within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of ''Pteranodon'' would have been present at any one time, and ''P. sternbergi'' (or ''Geosternbergia'') in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of ''P. longiceps''.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/>

==Biology and ecology==
===Range and environment===
{{main|Niobrara Formation}}
{{main|Western Interior Seaway}}
[[Image:Cretaceous seaway.png|thumb|Map of North America during the mid-Cretaceous Period, illustrating the Western Interior Seaway]]
Specimens assigned to ''Pteranodon'' have been found in both the [[Smoky Hill Chalk]] deposits of the [[Niobrara Formation]], and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the [[Pierre Shale Formation]]. When ''Pteranodon'' was alive, this area was covered by a large inland sea, known as the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. Famous for fossils collected since 1870, these formations extend from as far south as [[Kansas]] in the [[United States]] to [[Manitoba]] in [[Canada]]. However, ''Pteranodon'' specimens (or any pterosaur specimens) have only been found in the southern half of the formation, in Kansas, [[Wyoming]], and [[South Dakota]]. Despite the fact that numerous fossils have been found in the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada, no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there. This strongly suggests that the natural geographic range of ''Pteranodon'' covered only the southern part of the Niobrara, and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota.<ref name=bennett1994/>

Some very fragmentary fossils belonging to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly ''Pteranodon'' itself, have also been found on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and [[East Coast of the United States]]. For example, some bone fragments from the [[Mooreville Formation]] of [[Alabama]] and the [[Merchantville Formation]] of [[Delaware]] may have come from ''Pteranodon'', though they are too incomplete to make a definite identification.<ref name=bennett1994/> Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to ''Pteranodon'', but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.<ref name=bennett1994/>

[[image:Pteranodon longiceps mmartyniuk wiki.png|thumb|left|Life restoration of an adult male ''P. longiceps'' in flight]]
''Pteranodon longiceps'' would have shared the sky with the giant-crested pterosaur ''[[Nyctosaurus]]''. Compared to ''P. longiceps'', which was a very common species, ''Nyctosaurus'' was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed [[bird]], ''[[Ichthyornis]]''.<ref name=carpenter2003/>

It is likely that, as in other polygynous animals (in which males compete for association with harems of females), ''Pteranodon'' lived primarily on offshore rookeries, where they could nest away from land-based predators and feed far from shore; most ''Pteranodon'' fossils are found in locations which at the time, were hundreds of kilometres from the coastline.<ref name=bennett1992/>

Below the surface, the sea was populated primarily by invertebrates such as [[ammonite]]s and [[squid]]. Vertebrate life, apart from basal fish, included [[sea turtle]]s such as ''[[Toxochelys]]'', the [[plesiosaur]] ''[[Styxosaurus]]'', and the flightless diving bird ''[[Parahesperornis]]''. [[Mosasaur]]s were the most common marine reptiles, with genera including ''[[Clidastes]]'' and ''[[Tylosaurus]]''.<ref name=bennett2000/> At least some of these marine reptiles are known to have fed on ''Pteranodon''. [[Barnum Brown]], in 1904, reported plesiosaur stomach contents containing "pterodactyl" bones, most likely from ''Pteranodon''.<ref name=brown1904>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.20.501.184 | author = Brown, B. | year = 1904 | title = Stomach stones and the food of plesiosaurs | url = | journal = Science | volume = 20 | issue = 501| pages = 184<U+2013>185 | pmid = 17737868 }}</ref>

Fossils from terrestrial [[dinosaur]]s also have been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a [[hadrosaur]] appears to have been scavenged by a [[shark]]).<ref name=sharkbite>Everhart, M.J. and Ewell, K. (2006). {Shark-bitten dinosaur (Hadrosauridae) vertebrae from the Niobrara Chalk (Upper Coniacian) of western Kansas.) ''Kansas Academy of Science, Transactions'', '''109'''(1-2): 27-35.</ref>

===Flight===
[[File:Quad launch.jpg|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of a quadrupedally launching male ''Pteranodon longiceps'']] 
The wing shape of ''Pteranodon'' suggests that it would have flown rather like a modern-day [[albatross]]. This is based on the fact that ''Pteranodon'' had a high [[aspect ratio]] (wingspan to [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] length) similar to that of the albatross <U+2014> 9:1 for ''Pteranodon'', compared to 8:1 for an albatross. Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing, and use a flight pattern called "[[dynamic soaring]]" which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping, and without the aid of thermals (which do not occur over the open ocean the same way they do over land).<ref name=padian1983>{{Cite journal | author = Padian, K. | year = 1983 | title = A functional analysis of flying and walking in pterosaurs | url = | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 218<U+2013>239 }}</ref> While most of a ''Pteranodon'' flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of ''Pteranodon'' wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide.<ref name=flight_size>Witton, M.P. and Habib, M.B. (2010). "[http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0013982 On the Size and Flight Diversity of Giant Pterosaurs, the Use of Birds as Pterosaur Analogues and Comments on Pterosaur Flightlessness]." ''PLoS ONE'', '''5'''(11): e13982. {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0013982}}</ref>

Like other pterosaurs, ''Pteranodon'' probably took off from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.<ref name=flight_size/>

===Diet===
The diet of ''Pteranodon'' is known to have included [[fish]]; fossilized fish bones have been found in the [[stomach]] area of one ''Pteranodon'', and a fossilized fish [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] has been found between the jaws of another ''Pteranodon'', specimen AMNH 5098. Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of ''Pteranodon'' (though they may also have taken invertebrates).<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/>

Traditionally, most researchers have suggested that ''Pteranodon'' would have taken fish by dipping their beaks into the water while in low, soaring flight. However, this was probably based on the assumption that the animals could not take off from the water surface.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/> It is more likely that ''Pteranodon'' could take off from the water, and would have dipped for fish while swimming rather than while flying. Even a small, female ''Pteranodon'' could have reached a depth of at least {{convert|80|cm|in}} with its long bill and neck while floating on the surface, and they may have reached even greater depths by plunge-diving into the water from the air like some modern long-winged seabirds.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/> In 1994, Bennett noted that the head, neck, and shoulders of ''Pteranodon'' were as heavily built as diving birds, and suggested that they could dive by folding back their wings like the modern [[Gannet]].<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/>

===Crest function===
[[Image:Pteranodonts.png|thumb|350px|left|Variation in cranial anatomy (drawn to scale, unpreserved portions shown in gray)]]
''Pteranodon'' was notable for its skull crest, though the function of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations have focused on the blade-like, backward pointed crest of male ''P. longiceps'', however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1086/653001}}</ref>  Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.<ref name=bennett1992/>

Scientific interpretations of the crest's function began in 1910, when [[George Francis Eaton]] proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests.<ref name=eaton1910>Eaton, G.F. (1910). "Osteology of ''Pteranodon''." ''Memoirs of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''2''':1-38, pls. i-xxxi.</ref> Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable to have been a muscle attachment site.<ref name=bennett1992/> Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head.<ref name=eaton1910/> Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male ''P. longiceps'', not on the larger crests of ''P. sternbergi'' and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male ''P. sternbergi'' would, by themselves, have a negative effect on the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.<ref name=bennett1992/>
[[Image:Pteranodon longiceps skulls.jpg|thumb|''Pteranodon longiceps'' specimens YPM 2594 and 2493]] 
In 1943, [[Dominik von Kripp]] suggested that the crest may have served as a [[rudder]], an idea embraced by several later researchers.<ref name=bennett1992/><ref name=kripp1943>von Kripp, D. (1943). "Ein Lebensbild von ''Pteranodon ingens'' auf flugtechnischer Grundlage." ''Nova Acta Leopoldina, N.F.'', '''12'''(83): 16-32 [in German].</ref> One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even suggested that the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder.<ref name=stein1975>{{Cite journal | author = Stein, R.S. | year = 1975 | title = Dynamic analysis of ''Pteranodon ingens'': a reptilian adaptation to flight | url = | journal = Journal of Paleontology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 534<U+2013>548 }}</ref> The rudder hypothesis again, does not take into account females nor ''P. sternbergi'', which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem.<ref name=bramwell/> Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.<ref name=bennett1992/>

[[Alexander Kellner]] suggested that the large crests of the pterosaur ''[[Tapejara]]'', as well as other species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.<ref name=bennett1992/>

With these hypotheses ruled out, the best-supported hypothesis for crest function seems to be as a sexual display. This is consistent with the size variation seen in fossil specimens, where females and juveniles have small crests and males large, elaborate, variable crests.<ref name=bennett1992/>

===Sexual variation===
[[Image:Pteranodon sternbergi pair.jpg|thumb|left|Mounted replicas of female and male ''P. sternbergi'' skeletons at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]]]
Adult ''Pteranodon'' specimens may be divided into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived along side each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that ''Pteranodon'' species were [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.<ref name=bennett1992>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02724634.1992.10011472 | author = Bennett, S.C. | year = 1992 | title = Sexual dimorphism of ''Pteranodon'' and other pterosaurs, with comments on cranial crests | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 422<U+2013>434 }}</ref>

The sex of the different size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males.<ref name=bennett1992/>

Note that the overall size and crest size also corresponds to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, it seems that the large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.<ref name=bennett2001>{{Cite journal | author = Bennett, S.C. | year = 2001 | title = The osteology and functional morphology of the Late Cretaceous pterosaur ''Pteranodon''. General description of osteology | url = | journal = Palaeontographica, Abteilung A | volume = 260 | issue = | pages = 1<U+2013>112 }}</ref>

The fact that females appear to have outnumbered males two to one suggests that, as with modern animals with size-related sexual dimorphism, such as [[sea lion]]s and other [[pinniped]]s, ''Pteranodon'' might have been [[Polygyny|polygynous]], with a few males competing for association with groups consisting of large numbers of females. Similar to modern pinnipeds, ''Pteranodon'' may have competed to establish territory on rocky, offshore rookeries, with the largest, and largest-crested, males gaining the most territory and having more success mating with females. The crests of male ''Pteranodon'' would not have been used in competition, but rather as "visual dominance-rank symbols", with display rituals taking the place of physical competition with other males. If this [[hypothesis]] is correct, it also is likely that male ''Pteranodon'' played little to no part in rearing the young; such a behavior is not found in the males of modern polygynous animals who father many offspring at the same time.<ref name=bennett1992/>

===Locomotion===
[[Image:Pteranodon cat.jpg|thumb|Replica ''P. longiceps'' skeleton mounted in a quadrupedal posture]]
::''Main article: [[Pterosaur#Ground movement|Pterosaur: Ground movement]]''
Historically, the terrestrial locomotion of ''Pteranodon'', especially whether it was [[biped]]al or [[quadruped]]al, has been the subject of debate. Today, most pterosaur researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, thanks largely to the discovery of pterosaur [[fossil trackway|trackway]]s.<ref name=DMU06>{{cite book |last=Unwin |first=David M. |authorlink=David M.

The possibility of aquatic locomotion via swimming has been discussed briefly in several papers (Bennett 2001, 1994, and Bramwell & Whitfield 1974), and has been studied in detail at [[Michigan State University]] through the use of [[morphometrics]] and an [[extant phylogenetic bracket]] (a morphologically comparative technique invented by [[Larry Witmer]]).<ref name=bramwell>Bramwell, C.D. and Whitfield, G.R.

==Discovery and history==
''Pteranodon'' was the first pterosaur found outside of [[Europe]]. Its fossils first were found by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in 1870, in the Late Cretaceous [[Smoky Hill Chalk]] deposits of western Kansas. These [[chalk]] beds were deposited at the bottom of what was once the [[Western Interior Seaway]], a large shallow sea over what now is the midsection of the North American continent. These first specimens, YPM 1160 and YPM 1161, consisted of partial wing bones, as well as a tooth from the prehistoric fish ''[[Xiphactinus]]'', which Marsh mistakenly believed to belong to this new pterosaur (all known pterosaurs up to that point had teeth). In 1871, Marsh named the find ''Pterodactlyus Oweni'', assigning it to the well-known (but much smaller) European [[genus]] ''[[Pterodactylus]]''. Marsh also collected more wing bones of the large pterosaur in 1871. Realizing that the name ''Pterodactylus oweni'' already had been used in 1864 for a specimen of the European ''Pterodactylus'', Marsh re-named his North American pterosaur ''Pterodactylus occidentalis'', meaning "Western wing finger," in his 1872 description of the new specimen. He also named two additional species, based on size differences: ''Pterodactylus ingens'' (the largest specimen so far), and ''Pterodactlyus velox'' (the smallest).<ref name=bennett1994/>
[[Image:Ornithochirus umbrosus.jpg|thumb|Early illustration of ''Ornithochirus umbrosus'' (now ''Pteranodon''), when teeth erroneously were attributed to the species and the crest was unknown, 1872]]
Meanwhile, Marsh's rival [[Edward Drinker Cope]] also had unearthed several specimens of the large North American pterosaur. Based on these specimens, Cope named two new species, ''Ornithochirus umbrosus'' and ''Ornithochirus harpyia'', in an attempt to assign them to the large European genus ''[[Ornithocheirus]]''. As he misspelled the name (forgetting the 'e'), however, he accidentally created an entirely new genus.<ref name=bennett1994/> Cope's paper naming his ''''Ornithochirus'' species was published in 1872, just five days after Marsh's paper. This resulted in a dispute, fought in the published literature, over whose names had priority in what obviously were the same species.<ref name=bennett1994/> Cope conceded in 1875 that Marsh's names did have priority over his, but maintained that ''Pterodactylus umbrosus'' was a distinct species (but not genus) from any that Marsh had named previously.<ref name=cope1875>Cope, E.D. (1875). "The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous formations of the West." ''Report, U. S. Geological Survey of the Territories (Hayden)'', '''2''': 302 pp., 57 pls.</ref> Re-evaluation by later scientists has supported Marsh's case, and found that Cope's assertion that ''P. umbrosus'' was a larger, distinct species were incorrect.<ref name=bennett1994/>

While the first ''Pteranodon'' wing bones were collected by Marsh and Cope in the early 1870s, the first ''Pteranodon'' skull was found on May 2, 1876, along the [[Smoky Hill River]] in [[Wallace County, Kansas|Wallace County]] (now Logan County), Kansas, USA, by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], a fossil collector working for Marsh.<ref name="bennett2000">Bennett, S.C. (2000). "Inferring stratigraphic position of fossil vertebrates from the Niobrara Chalk of western Kansas." ''Current Research in Earth Sciences: Kansas Geological Survey Bulletin'', '''244'''(Part 1): 26 pp.</ref> A second, smaller skull soon was discovered as well. These skulls showed that the North American pterosaurs were different from any European species, in that they lacked teeth. Marsh recognized that this major difference, describing the specimens as "distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth." Marsh recognized that this characteristic warranted a new genus, and he coined the name ''Pteranodon'' ("wing without tooth") in 1876. Marsh also reclassified all the previously named North American species from ''Pterodactylus'' to ''Pteranodon'', with the larger skull, YPM 1117, referred to the new species ''Pteranodon longiceps''.<ref name=marsh1876a>{{Cite journal | author = Marsh, O.C. | year = 1876a | title = Notice of a new sub-order of Pterosauria | url = | journal = American Journal of Science, Series 3 | volume = 11 | issue = 65| pages = 507<U+2013>509 }}</ref> He also named an additional species, ''Pteranodon gracilis'', based on a wing bone that he mistook for a pelvic bone. He soon realized his mistake, and re-classified that specimen into a separate genus, which he named ''[[Nyctosaurus]]''.<ref name=marsh1976b>{{Cite journal | author = Marsh, O.C. | year = 1876b | title = Principal characters of American pterodactyls | url = | journal = American Journal of Science, Series 3 | volume = 12 | issue = 72| pages = 479<U+2013>480 }}</ref>

Some of the most influential studies of ''Pteranodon'' during the 20th Century were published by [[George Francis Eaton]], who conducted thorough re-analysis of the known specimens and published some of the first good photographs and illustrations of the best specimens.<ref name=bennett1994niobrara/> During the early 1990s, S. Christopher Bennett also published several major papers reviewing the anatomy, taxonomy and life history of ''Pteranodon''.<ref name=kellner2010/>

==Classification==
===Valid species===
[[Image:Pteranodon-sternbergi jconway.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of ''P. sternbergi'', alternately classified as ''Geosternbergia sternbergi'']]
Many researchers consider there to be at least two species of ''Pteranodon''. However, aside from the differences between males and females described above, the post-cranial skeletons of ''Pteranodon'' show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies and wings of all pteranodonts were essentially identical.<ref name=bennett1994/>

Two species of ''Pteranodon'' are traditionally recognized as valid: ''Pteranodon longiceps'', the [[type species]], and ''Pteranodon sternbergi''. The species differ only in the shape of the crest in adult males (described above), and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones.<ref name=bennett1994/> Because well-preserved ''Pteranodon'' skull fossils are extremely rare, researchers use stratigraphy (i.e. which rock layer of the geologic formation a fossil is found in) to determine species identity in most cases.

''Pteranodon sternbergi'' is the only known species of ''Pteranodon'' with an upright-crest. The lower jaw of ''P. sternbergi'' was 1.25&nbsp;meters (4&nbsp;ft) long.<ref name="BTD">Zimmerman, H., Preiss, B., and Sovak, J. (2001). ''Beyond the Dinosaurs!: sky dragons, sea monsters, mega-mammals, and other prehistoric beasts'', Simon and Schuster. ISBN 0-689-84113-2.</ref> It was collected by [[George F. Sternberg]] in 1952 and described by [[John Christian Harksen]] in 1966, from the lower portion of the Niobrara Formation. It was older than ''P. longiceps'' and is considered by Bennett to be the direct ancestor of the later species.<ref name=bennett1994/>

Because fossils identifiable as ''P. sternbergi'' are found exclusively in the lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and ''P. longiceps'' fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on its position in the geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).<ref name=kellner2010/>

===Alternate classifications===
Due to the subtle variations between specimens of pteranodontid from the Niobrara Formation, most researchers have assigned all of them to the single genus ''Pteranodon'', in at least two species (''P. longiceps'' and ''P. sternbergi'') distinguished mainly by the shape of the crest. However, the classification of these two forms has varied from researcher to researcher. In 1972, [[Halsey Wilkinson Miller]] published a paper arguing that the various forms forms of ''Pteranodon'' were different enough to be placed in distinct sub-genera. He named these ''Pteranodon (Occidentalia) occidentalis'' (for the now-disused species ''P. occidentalis'') and ''Pteranodon (Sternbergia) sternbergi''. However, the name ''Sternbergia'' was preoccupied, and in 1978 Miller re-named the species ''Pteranodon (Geosternbergia) sternbergi'', and named a third subgenus/species combination for ''P. longiceps'', as ''Pteranodon (Longicepia) longiceps''. Most prominent pterosaur researchers of the late 20th Century however, including [[S. Christopher Bennett]] and [[Peter Wellnhofer]], did not adopt these subgeneric names, and continued to place all pteranodont species into the single genus ''Pteranodon''.

In 2010, pterosaur researcher [[Alexander Kellner]] revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's opinion that the differences between the ''Pteranodon'' species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed ''P. sternbergi'' into the genus named by Miller, ''Geosternbergia'', along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male ''P. longiceps''. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to ''Geosternbergia''. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known ''Geosternbergia'', he assigned it to the new species ''Geosternbergia maysei''. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as ''G. maysei'', but because they lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them.<ref name=kellner2010/>

===Disused species===
[[Image:Williston Pteranodon.jpg|left|thumb|S.W. Williston's reconstruction of ''Ornithostoma ingens'', a synonym of ''P. longiceps'']] 
A number of additional species of ''Pteranodon'' have been named since the 1870s, although most now are considered to be junior synonyms of two or three valid species. The best-supported is the [[type species]], ''P. longiceps'', based on the well-preserved specimen including the first-known skull found by S. W. Williston. This individual had a wingspan of {{unit length|m|7}}.<ref name=PW96>{{cite book |last=Wellnhofer |first=Peter |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs |origyear=1991 |year=1996 |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |location=New York |isbn=0-7607-0154-7 |pages=139 }}</ref> Other valid species include the possibly larger, ''P. sternbergi'', with a wingspan originally estimated at {{unit length|m|9}}.<ref name=PW96/> ''P. occidentalis'', ''P. velox'', ''P. umbrosus'', ''P. harpyia'', and ''P. comptus'' are considered to be nomina dubia by Bennett (1994) and others who question their validity. All probably are synonymous with the more well-known species.
[[File:Old Pteranodon mount.jpg|thumb|''P. occidentalis'' mount wherein arms, shoulder girdle, and fingers are actual bones, and the rest has been drawn from other specimens.]] 
Because the key distinguishing characteristic Marsh noted for ''Pteranodon'' was its lack of teeth, any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever it was found in the world, tended to be attributed to ''Pteranodon'' during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion. The name became a [[wastebasket taxon]], rather like the dinosaur ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several [[Genus|sub-genera]] have in the nineteen seventies been erected by [[Halsey Wilkinson Miller]] to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include ''Longicepia'', ''Occidentalia'', and ''Geosternbergia''). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of ''Pteranodon'' include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, ''P. orogensis'' and ''P. orientalis'', are not pteranodontids and have been renamed ''[[Bennettazhia]] oregonensis'' and ''[[Bogolubovia]] orientalis'' respectively.
