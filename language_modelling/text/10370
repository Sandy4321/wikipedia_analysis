'''Ellison Shoji Onizuka''' ([[June 24]], [[1946]] - [[January 28]], [[1986]]) was a [[United States|Japanese-American]] [[astronaut]] from [[Kealakekua]], [[Kona]], [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]] who died during the destruction of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']], where he was serving as mission specialist on mission [[STS-51-L]].

==Early life==

Ellison Onizuka was the oldest son and second youngest child of the late Masamitsu and Mitsue Onizuka.  He had two older sisters, Shirley and Norma, and a younger brother, Claude.  Claude became the family spokesman when Ellison attained fame as an astronaut and continued after the [[STS 51-L|Challenger accident]].  Growing up, Ellison was an active participant in [[4-H]] and the [[Scouting in Hawaii|Boy Scouts]], where he reached the level of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].  

He graduated from [[Konawaena High School]] in Kealakekua in [[1964]].  He received a Bachelor's degree in [[aerospace engineering]] in June 1969, and a Master's in that field in December of the same year, from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  He participated in Air Force ROTC during his time there and is an alumnus of [[Triangle Fraternity]].

Onizuka married Lorna Leiko Yoshida while completing his studies at the University of Colorado.  They had two daughters, Janelle Mitsue (b. [[1969]]) and Darien Lei Shizue (b. [[1975]]).

==Air Force career==

In January [[1970]], Onizuka entered active duty with the [[United States Air Force]], where he served as a flight test engineer and as a test pilot.  At the Sacramento Air Logistics Center at [[McClellan Air Force Base]], he worked in test flight programs and systems security engineering for the [[F-84]], [[F-100 Super Sabre|F-100]], [[F-105]], [[F-111]], [[EC-121|EC-121T]], [[T-33]], [[T-39]], [[T-28 Trojan|T-28]], and [[A-1 Skyraider|A-1]].

From August [[1974]] to July [[1975]], Onizuka attended the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]].  In July [[1975]], he was assigned to the Test Flight Center at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]].  He became a squadron test flight engineer at the Test Pilot School, and later worked as a manager for engineering support in the training resources division.  His duties there were based on the instruction of courses and the management of all flight test modifications for all of the airship fleet ([[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]], [[A-37]], [[T-38 Talon|T-38]], [[F-4]], [[T-33]], and [[KC-135|NKC-135]]) being used for the Test Pilot School and Test Flight Center.  Onizuka managed to register more than 1,700 flight hours.

==NASA career==

Onizuka was selected for the astronaut program in January 1978, and completed one year of evaluation and training in August 1979.  Later, he worked in the experimentation team, Orbiter test team, and launch support crew at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] for the STS-1 and STS-2.  At NASA, he worked on the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) test and revision software team.  He also collaborated on other technical projects, for instance, as astronaut crew team coordinator.

His first space mission took place on [[January 24]], [[1985]], with the Kennedy Space Center launch of mission [[STS 51-C]] on ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery]]'', the first space shuttle mission for the [[Department of Defense]].  Onizuka was accompanied by the commander [[Ken Mattingly]], pilot [[Loren Shriver]], fellow mission specialist [[James Buchli]], and payload specialist [[Gary E. Payton]].  During the mission, Onizuka was responsible for the activities of the primary payloads, which included the unfolding of the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) surface.  After 48 orbits around the Earth, ''Discovery'' landed at the Kennedy Space Center on [[January 27]], 1985.  Onizuka had completed a total of 74 hours in space.

Onizuka was assigned to the mission [[STS 51-L]] on the ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger]]'' that took off from Kennedy Space Center at 11:38:00 EST (16:38:00 UTC) on [[January 28]], [[1986]].  The other Challenger crew members were commander [[Dick Scobee]], pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J. Smith]], mission specialists [[Ronald McNair]], [[Judith Resnik]], and [[Gregory Jarvis]], and payload specialist [[Christa McAuliffe]].  Challenger was destroyed by aerodynamic stress when rupture of the fuel tank at 73 seconds after launch turned the spacecraft out of proper position. All seven crew members were killed. NASA had estimated that the probability of a catastrophic accident during launch, the most perilous portion of space flight, was 1 in 438.

At the time of his death, Onizuka held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.

==Memberships and distinctions==

Onizuka belonged to the following organizations: Society of Flight Test Engineers, the Air Force Association, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Tau, and [[Triangle Fraternity]].

Among his distinctions are the Air Force Medallion of Merit, Air Force Service Medallion, Air Force Organizational Excellence Award, and National Defense Service Medal.

==Legacy==
[[Image:11-11-06-LittleTokyo-StVibiana-LAskyline.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Astronaut Ellison S Onizuka St. in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo neighborhood]] 
[[Onizuka Air Force Station]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]], [[Onizuka Center for International Astronomy Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station]] on [[Mauna Kea]], [[Hawai'i]], and the [[Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Space Center]] at [[Kona International Airport]] in [[Hawaii]] are dedicated to him.

Two [[astronomy|astronomical]] features were also named after him: an [[asteroid]] discovered by [[Edward L. G. Bowell]] on [[February 8]], [[1984]], [[3355 Onizuka]] and a 29 km diameter [[Impact crater|crater]] on the [[moon]], [[Onizuka (crater)|Onizuka Crater]]. [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles, California|Little Tokyo]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] also has a street named after him, as does the street surrounding Whitcomb Elementary in Clear Lake (Houston) Texas, where his daughters attended school at the time of the Challenger disaster.

=== In Movies/TV ===
* Onizuka was portrayed by [[Keone Young]] in the [[1990]] TV movie ''[[Challenger (TV film)|Challenger]]''.
* The main protagonist of the manga [[Great Teacher Onizuka]] also bears a similar name - Eikichi Onizuka. It is likely that Eikichi's ability to withstand most degrees of physical injury may have been inspired by Ellison's legacy.
* In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', a shuttle carried aboard USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D bears his name, although only shown in one episode, ''The Ensigns of Command''.
