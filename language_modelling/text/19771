'''Saddleback Mountain''' is a [[mountain]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] which rises to about 600 metres above sea level and has spectacular{{According to whom|date=July 2011}} views of [[Noorinan Mountain]], 662&nbsp;metres above sea level, and Barren Grounds Plateau to the west and south to [[Coolangatta Mountain]] and [[Pigeon House Mountain]] to [[Ulladulla, New South Wales|Ulladulla]], and north over [[Lake Illawarra]], the [[Illawarra escarpment]] and to the [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]] Sandhills and [[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]] Oil Refinery on a clear day.

When viewed from [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]] and [[Shellharbour, New South Wales|Shellharbour]] it has a distinctive saddle-shaped peak and is connected to the southernmost tip of the Illawarra Escarpment (though the escarpment itself continues into [[Kangaroo Valley, New South Wales|Kangaroo Valley]]), Noorinan Mountain by a high ridge, on which is [[Hoddles Track]], built by early surveyor Hoddle and which once stretched from [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]] to Kiama before a more suitable route was found quickly over the escarpment. This section goes to the edge of Barren Grounds Plateau (Noorinan Mountain) but does not allow access into the Barren Grounds reserve. An offshoot track goes to Foxground to the south of Noorinan Mountain promontory.

Its summit is reached by Saddleback Mountain road, which goes from Kiama to the summit via a steep turn-off from the main road. This section is often used by walkers and cars but buses are not allowed due to the risk. Saddleback lookout, near the electric towers on the summit and the Western and Southern lookouts, has fine views and is popular with tourists and motorists who drive up the winding picturesque road to the summit{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} which passed dairy country common in the area. The lookout is on a wooden projected deck, with fine views of Noorinan Mountain, Knights Hill, lake Illawarra, Stockyard Mountain and other features of the plain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The chimneys of Port Kembla stand out near the horizon. The west lookout looks to Noorinan Mountain promontory and at the Barren Grounds Plateau, and, to the south, Fox Mountain, Mount Coolangatta and the Shoalhaven.

The foothills go down to Kiama and [[Gerringong, New South Wales|Gerringong]] and the sea and down to [[Jamberoo, New South Wales|Jamberoo]] valley and the Minnamurra River. The entire area was once covered by a subtropical rainforest known as the Illawarra Scrub but is now restricted to a small area around the summit lookout. The foothills include much dairy farming, and many historic dry walls remain. On the eastern ridge of the mountain is Saddleback House and in the northern foothills is Jerrara Dam, the region's first water supply, built in the 19th century. Just north of the summit is a second peak, lesser known, called Mount Brandon. A few kilometres south is Fox Mountain, an extension of Saddleback with its own peak.

The road is good, but some parts are pretty bumpy.
