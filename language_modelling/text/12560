'''Christianity in Lebanon''' has a long and continuos history beginning with visits of Jesus to the southern territories where he undertook many miraculous healings. Scriptures tell us that Peter and Paul evangelized the [[Phoenician]]s  whom he affiliated to the ancient [[patriarchate]] of [[Antioch]]. The spread of Christianity in [[Mount Lebanon|the Lebanon]] was very slow where paganism persisted in mountaintop strongholds.

Before the Christian faith reached the territory of Lebanon, Jesus had traveled to its southern parts near [[Tyre]] where the scripture tells us that he cured a possessed Canaanite child. <ref group="nb">Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.

The earliest indisputable tradition of Christianity in Lebanon can be traced back to [[Saint Maron]] in the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE,  the founder of national and ecclesiastical Maronitism. Saint Maron adopted an ascetic recluse life on the banks of the Orontes river in the vicinity of [[Homs]]<U+2013>[[Syria]] and founded a community of monks which began to preach the gospel in the surrounding areas.<ref name= "ASA"/> By Faith, liturgy, rite, religious books and heritage, the Maronites were of Syrian Orthodox (Jacobite) origin.<ref name= "MMM"/> The Saint Maron Monastery was too close to Antioch to enable the monks freedom and autonomy which prompted [[John Maron|Saint John Maron]], the first Maronite patriarch-elect to lead his monks into the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]] to escape emperor [[Justinian II]]<U+2019>s persecution; the Maronites monks finally settled in the [[Kadisha Valley|Qadisha valley]].<ref name= "ASA"/> During the [[Arab]] conquest the Christians, particularly the Maronites were persecuted, the persecution culminated during the Umayyad caliphate; nevertheless the influence of the Maronite establishment spread throughout the Lebanese mountains and became a considerable [[Feudalism|feudal]] force.  It wasn<U+2019>t until the [[Crusades]] that the western world knew of the existence of the Maronites.<ref name= "ASA"/> In the 16<sup>th</sup> century, the [[Maronite Church]] adopted the catechism of the [[Catholic Church]] and merged with it.<ref name= "MMM"/> Moreover, Rome dispatched Franciscan, Dominican and later [[Jesuite]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] to Lebanon to secure the conversion of the Maronites to [[Catholicism]].<ref name= "ASA"/>

Spurring from their turbulent history, the Maronites formed a secluded identity in the mountains and valleys of Lebanon,_led by the Maronite patriarch who voices his opinion in temporal issues_ identify themselves as a unique community which by religion and culture is distinct from the predominantly [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] world.<ref name= "MMM"/> The Maronites played a major part in the definition of and the creation of the state of Lebanon. The modern state of Greater Lebanon was established by [[France]] in 1920 after the instigation of Maronite ambitious leaders headed by patriarch [[Elias Peter Hoayek]] who presided delegations to France following [[World war I|WWI]] and requested the re-establishment of the entity of the Principality of Lebanon (1515AD-1840AD).  With the creation of the state of Lebanon, Arabism was overcome by Lebanism which emphasizes Lebanon<U+2019>s Mediterranean and Phoenician heritage. In the National Pact, an unwritten gentleman<U+2019>s agreement between the Maronite President [[Bechara El Khoury|Bshara el-Khoury]] and Sunni prime minister [[Riad as-Solh]] the seats of presidency were distributed between the main Lebanese religious denominations; according to the pact the President of the [[Lebanon|Lebanese republic]] shall always be a Maronite, furthermore, the pact also states that Lebanon is a state with an <U+201C>Arab face<U+201D> (not an Arab identity).<ref name= "KBAD">{{Cite book | publisher = American university in Cairo press | isbn = 9774161971, 9789774161971 | pages = 515 | last = Korany | first = Bahgat | coauthors = Ali E.

==Demographics==
{{Seealso|Demographics of Lebanon}}

The number of Christians in Lebanon has been disputed for many years. There has been no official [[census]] in Lebanon since 1932. But official records confirm that in 1926 when the state of Lebanon was officially announced and recognised by the allies the Christians formed 84% of the population. Many argue over the percentage and population of Christians in Lebanon. One estimate of the Christian share of Lebanon's population as of the late 2000s is 50%.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/le.html CIA World Factbook, Lebanon]</ref> The country has the largest percentage of Christians of all the Middle Eastern nations.

The [[Maronite Church]], a church in communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], is the largest and politically most active and influential denomination of Lebanon's Christians. The [[Greek Orthodox Church]] forms the second largest proportion of Lebanese Christians. The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] also forms a large portion of the Christian population in Lebanon.  Other branches of Christianity, including the [[Greek Melkite Catholic Church]], an Eastern Catholic Church loyal to the Pope, are very common in Lebanon. The Latin Rite Roman [[Catholic]] Church, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] Church, the [[Syriac Orthodox]] are also important Christian churches within Lebanon. These branches of Christianity are very influential in daily business and in the economy of Lebanon. In the Lebanese Parliament, Christians hold 64 seats in tandem with 64 Muslim seats. The Maronite Catholic church holds 34 seats, the Greek Orthodox 14, and the Armenian, Greek Catholic, and [[Protestant]] make up the remaining 22.

==Churches and monasteries in Lebanon==

The head of the [[Maronite Church]] is the Maronite Patriarch of Antioch, who is elected by the bishops of the Maronite church and now resides in [[Bkerk<U+00E9>]], north of Beirut (the Maronite Patriarch resides in the northern town of Dimane during the summer months). The current Patriarch (since 1986) is Cardinal Mar [[Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]]. When a new patriarch is elected and enthroned, he requests ecclesiastic communion from the Pope, thus maintaining the Catholic Church communion. Patriarchs may also be accorded the status of cardinals, in the rank of cardinal-bishops. They share with other Catholics the same doctrine, but Maronites retain their own liturgy and hierarchy. Strictly speaking, the Maronite church belongs to the Antiochene Tradition and is a West Syro-Antiochene Rite. Syriac is the liturgical language, instead of Latin. Nevertheless, they are considered, with the Syro-Malabar Church, to be among the most Latinised of the Eastern Catholic Churches.

The main Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, is [[St. George Orthodox Cathedral]], which is situated in the middle of Centerville in downtown Lebanon. The Seat of the [[Maronite|Maronite Catholic]] Church is in Bkerk<U+00E9>. There are [[monastery|monasteries]] in Lebanon which run by both the Maronite and Orthodox Church. The Holy Monastery of Saint George in [[Deir El Harf]], Saint John the Baptist Monastery in [[Douma]], both date back to the 5th century. The Balamand Monastery in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] is a very prominent monastery that has a [[seminary]] and a University associated with its monastery.

==Current political and religious issues==
[[File:Cardinal Nasrallah Peter Sfeir.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Cardinal Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]] is the Patriarch of the Maronite Church]]
The [[Taif agreement]] helped establish a power sharing system between the Christian and Muslim Lebanese political parties [http://www.almashriq.hiof.no/ddc/projects/pspa/conflict-resolution.html]. The political and economic situation in Lebanon had improved greatly. Lebanon had rebuilt its infrastructure. The past affairs between Hezbollah and Israel have threatened to deteriorate Lebanon's political and economic situation, growing tension between March 8 and March 14 alliances are threatening Lebanon with strife. The Christian community is currently divided with some aligned with The [[Kataeb]] party, [[Michel Aoun]]'s [[Free Patriotic Movement]], and the Leader of the Lebanese Forces Movement Samir Gaegae, and others with the various March 14 Christian leaders.  Although the taif has been considered by some that it would degrade the Christian role in Lebanon removing much of the president's role (which is given to the Maronites) and increasing the roles of the prime minister (a Sunni), but the Lebanese Christian President still plays a major role in the Lebanese Politics as he is still the Commander in Chief of the armed forces and no governments can be formed without his approval and the presidential seal.
Many Lebanese leaders including world leaders are currently reviewing the reinstatement of some of the powers of the President of the Lebanese Republic that was removed at the Taif agreement.

Christians also holds the position of the head of the army which formes the role of the Head of all armed forces that reports directly to the Commander in Chief The President of the Republic, this position is given to the Maronites since the establishment of the Lebanese army.
The president of the Lebanese Central bank is also a position held by Lebanese Christians as the majority of the banking systems and private banks in Lebanon which forms the strongest and biggest banks in the middle east these banks are largely owned by Christians.
