'''Madame Fatal''' (sometimes referred to as '''Madam Fatal''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and a [[comic book]] [[superhero]] active during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. Madame Fatal was created and originally illustrated by artist/writer [[Art Pinajian]] and the debut of the character was in the ''[[Crack Comics]]'' series #1 (May, 1940), a comic book [[anthology]] series published by [[Quality Comics]]. Madame Fatal continued as feature in that title but when the character was not well received, Madame Fatal made a last appearance in #22 (March, 1942).

The character later appeared in some publications by [[DC Comics]] when DC Comics bought the rights to the character in 1956, along with a bulk buy of all Quality Comic's characters, although Madame Fatal not been seen much since except a few brief appearances and passing mentions by other comic book characters.

Madame Fatal is notable for being a male superhero who dressed up as an elderly woman and as such is the first [[cross-dressing]] comics hero. The original incarnation of the more famous cross-dressing character, [[Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel)|Red Tornado]], later that year, would become the first cross-dressing heroine.<ref>[http://ragnell.blogspot.com/2006/05/mama-thon-red-tornado.html Ragnell's Written Word (May 11, 2006): "Mama-Thon &mdash; The Red Tornado"]</ref> 

==Origin story==
"She" was actually '''Richard Stanton''', a handsome, pipe-smoking, dapper, middle-aged blonde Caucasian man at the peak of his physical abilities. He had made a vast fortune playing the stock market successfully, incurring the jealousy of many of those close to him. In his private life, Stanton was also a widow and a single father, being the parent of a two-year-old (unnamed) girl. Initially, Stanton is a world-famous stage, theatre, radio and film [[actor]] living in [[New York City]], a lover of [[theatrics]], until his wealthy and prominent celebrity status brought unwanted attention from costumed villains. Stanton's daughter was kidnapped by them and the police were unable to uncover their identities, but Stanton was, on his wits and superior investigative skills. As such, Stanton decided to take matters into his own hands after he deduced that the leader of the gang was '''John Carver''', a crime kingpin who had been running [[extortion]] rackets in various cities.

As a civilian, Stanton had already been searching for Carver for eight years, after a fight they had and the threats that Carver had made. Prior to this, Carver had been the first man to love Stanton's late wife, and Carver had been jilted when she chose Stanton instead. After the kidnapping of Stanton's daughter, and when the police got nowhere, Stanton's wife was riddled with guilt as it was her previous connection with Carver which had brought about the whole scenario. She died of a broken heart.<ref>http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8ie37mgxIXA/SbcsVC0nXJI/AAAAAAAAFXU/8g1PphyVit4/s1600-h/UNMASKED.jpg</ref>

Stanton was able to infiltrate the John Carver gang due to his convincing acting and stage disguise as an old, helpless, red-cloaked woman with a [[Stick fighting|red walking cane]] which doubled as a sly [[quarterstaff]]. Once inside their lair Stanton then used his natural athleticism and physical abilities to wipe out the unsuspecting gang, and revealed his true identity to Carver. In the ensuing fight, Carver (a formidable fighter himself) knocked Stanton to the ground and attempted to shoot him with a revolver, but Stanton quickly pulled out a rug from underneath Carver, tripping him up, and Carver accidentally shot himself instead. In his dying breaths, the crime kingpin told Stanton his daughter was still alive, although held captive by another villain. He never revealed who before dying.

Stanton decided to retire from acting and continue down the path of a crime-fighter and bring other villains to justice, inspired by his first success, adopting the alter-ego '''Madame Fatal'''. Stanton made his last appearance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 1, 1930, as an old woman, which garnered Stanton praise and acclaim from the audience. After that he disappeared from public view and became "Madame Fatal" full-time. Stanton would also use the alternate identity to attempt to locate his captive daughter, whom Carver had passed onto other villains. When the character rights were sold to DC Comics and DC decided not to continue the character, this plot point was never resolved, and it was never revealed which villain was actually holding Stanton's daughter.

==Powers and abilities==
Although Stanton had no actual super powers to speak of, he was a strong, agile and athletic man at his physical peak and a skilled fighter with a powerful punch, and had a high level of intelligence and intuition which aided his investigative abilities and [[manhunting|locating criminals]]. Madame Fatal often came up against criminal masterminds and supervillains such as '''Doctor Prowl''' (a black-masked, gentleman-like murderer) and '''The Jester''' (a violent thief who laughs at death) and their henchmen<ref>http://asylums.insanejournal.com/scans_daily/599622.html</ref>; however Madame Fatal's disguise gave him an edge in physical combat as his foes would underestimate his strength and speed. Madame Fatal's red walking cane was also a formidable weapon in Stanton's hands as he adept at using [[The Cane as a Weapon|the cane as a weapon]].

The old woman disguise was aided strongly by his expert acting skills, being a former professional actor and female impersonator. This same disguise also often raised Stanton above suspicion, and made him an expert in confidence trickery, inflitration, stealth, information gathering, and melting anonymously into crowds. Madame Fatal was also aided on occasion by his pet [[parrot]], '''Hamlet''', his only connection to his previous life. Hamlet was named so because he was intelligent enough to recite [[Shakespeare]], and would inspire Stanton and help Stanton remember important information.

==Controversy and ridicule==
Madame Fatal was never a popular character given the cross-dressing angle<ref>http://againwiththecomics.blogspot.com/2009/03/madame-fatal-golden-age-transvestite.html</ref>, which is perhaps part of the reason why DC Comics decided not to further run with the character and limited him to light-hearted jibes made by other comic book heroes.

The character has often been ridiculed, such as in a recent article on [[Cracked.com]] which has been read well over half a million times, listed the character as one of the "7 most crappiest super heroes in comic book history".<ref>http://www.cracked.com/article_16547_7-crappiest-super-heroes-in-comic-book-history.html</ref>

Also, the later depictions of Madame Fatal living alone, and as Stanton was a former stage actor who lived alone, many modern readers believe that the cross-dressing character was actually a thinly-disguised [[homosexual]], though this was never expressly acknowledged in ''Crack Comics'', nor are Pinajian's intentions known. The fact that Stanton had a daughter to a previous marriage would suggest otherwise.

==Madame Fatal in recent years==
[[DC Comics]] acquired the rights to all the former Quality Comics characters in 1956 along with a bulk buy of them all, but has yet to make use of Madame Fatal beyond a few very brief cameos and a few mere mentions that made light of the character's transvestite M.O.

Outside of regular [[DC Universe]] continuity, [[comix]] writer [[Kim Deitch]] (''[[Hollywoodland]]'') did a story in 1972 that purported to be about Madame Fatale. But inasmuch as she did things in it that it's hard to imagine a mainstream comic book character doing, there could be some question about the character's identity in this incarnation.<ref>http://www.toonopedia.com/fatal.htm</ref>

[[James Robinson]] and Paul Smith featured Madam Fatal in a cameo in 1993's ''[[The Golden Age (comics)|The Golden Age]]''. In ''The Golden Age'' #4, Madam Fatal appears in a panel surrounded by the [[Fiddler (comics)|Fiddler]], and the [[Gambler (comics)|Gambler]], who all appear to be courting the cross-dressing hero while other villains (including [[Wildfire (Golden Age)|Wildfire]], [[Harlequin (comics)|Harlequin]], and the [[Psycho-Pirate]]) stand around giggling (apparently knowing Madam Fatal's true gender).

The most recent time Madame Fatal has been seen or even mentioned in DC Comics canon was a homosexual-based joke in 1999, yet the passing reference would seem to imply Madame Fatal's death. In a scene in ''[[Justice Society of America|JSA]]'' #1 (August, 1999) that depicted the funeral of the first [[The Sandman (DC Comics Golden Age)|Sandman]], [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]] wonders whether his own funeral will "be like the time they buried Madame Fatal here, and no one turned up for the funeral but the touring cast of ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]''?"<ref>http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/madfatal.htm</ref> This would seem to suggest that the character of Madame Fatale is considered deceased in the [[DC universe]], or at least has suffered a [[comic book death]].
