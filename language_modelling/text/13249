'''U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)''' is a [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement agency]] of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] charged with regulating and facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. regulations, including trade, customs and immigration. CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the United States.<ref>"[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/about/mission/cbp_is.xml This is CBP]." U.S. Customs and Border Protection. December 11, 2008. Retrieved June 19, 2010.</ref><ref>"[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/about/accomplish/fy09_typical_day.xml CBP Statistics as of Fiscal Year 2009]." U.S. Customs and Border Protection. February 16, 2010. Retrieved October 7, 2010.</ref> It has a workforce of more than 43,600 sworn federal agents and officers. It has its headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>"[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contacts/headquarters.xml CBP Headquarters]." U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Retrieved on June 19, 2010.</ref>

While its primary mission is preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States, CBP is also responsible for apprehending individuals attempting to enter the United States illegally, stemming the flow of illegal drugs and other [[contraband]], protecting United States agricultural and economic interests from harmful pests and diseases, and protecting American businesses from intellectual property theft.

==Organization==
CBP has a workforce of over 58,000 employees, including officers and agents, agriculture specialists, aircraft pilots, trade specialists, mission support staff, and canine enforcement officers and agents.
* More than 21,180 CBP Officers screen passengers and cargo at over 300 ports of entry.
* Over 2,200 CBP Agriculture Specialists work to curtail the spread of harmful pests and plant and animal diseases that may harm America<U+2019>s farms and food supply or cause bio- and agro-terrorism.
* Over 21,370 Border Patrol Agents protect {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of border with Mexico and {{convert|5000|mi|km}} of border with Canada.
* Nearly 1,050 Air and Marine Interdiction Agents prevent people, weapons, narcotics, and conveyances from illegal entry by air and water.
* Nearly 2,500 employees in CBP revenue positions collect over $30 billion annually in entry duties and taxes through the enforcement of trade and tariff laws. These collections provide the second largest revenue for the U.S. Government. In addition, these employees fulfill the agency<U+2019>s trade mission by appraising and classifying imported merchandise. These employees serve in positions such as import specialist, auditor, international trade specialist, and textile analyst.
* The CBP Canine Enforcement Program conducts the largest number of [[working dog]]s of any U.S. federal [[law enforcement agency]]. K-9 teams are assigned to 73 commercial ports and 74 Border Patrol stations throughout the nation.<ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/fact_sheets/k9_enforce/fact_sheet_canines.xml U.S. Customs and Border Protection Canine Enforcement Program]</ref><ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/canines/canine.xml Mission, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Canine Enforcement Program]</ref>

There are 327 officially designated ports of entry and an additional 14 pre-clearance locations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/contacts/preclear_locations.xml |title=Preclearance Locations |publisher=CBP.gov |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> in Canada, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Caribbean]]. CBP is also in charge of the [[Container Security Initiative]], which identifies and inspects foreign cargo in its mother country before it is to be imported into the United States.

The major "offices" operating under CBP are:

*The [[Office of Field Operations]] (OFO); headed by Assistant Commissioner [[Thomas S. Winkowski]].
*The [[United States Border Patrol|Office of Border Patrol]] (OBP); headed by Chief [[Michael J. Fisher]].
*The [[Office of CBP Air|Office of Air & Marine]] (OAM); headed by Assistant Commissioner [[Michael C. Kostelnik]].
*The [[Office of International Trade]] (OT); headed by Assistant Commissioner [[Allen Gina]].
*The Office of Information and Technology (OIT); headed by Assistant Commissioner Charles Armstrong.
*The Office of Administration (OA); formerly the Office of Finance; headed by Assistant Commissioner Eugene Schied.
*The Office of Training and Development (OTD); headed by Assistant Commissioner Patricia M. Duffy.
*The Office of Internal Affairs (IA); headed by Assistant Commissioner James Tomsheck.
*The [[Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison]] (OIIL); headed by Assistant Commissioner [[Donna Bucella]]. Established in July 2011, following a re-organization of the Office of Intelligence & Operations Coordination (OIOC) from the merger of the former Offices of Intelligence and Anti-Terrorism in July 2007.

CBP assess all passengers flying into the U.S. for terrorist risk via [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] and systems such as [[Advance Passenger Information System]] (APIS), United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology [[US-VISIT]], and the Student and Exchange Visitor System [[SEVIS]]. CBP also works with the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] to screen high-risk imported food shipments in order to prevent bio-terrorism/agro-terrorism.

Through the [[Container Security Initiative]], CBP works jointly with host nation counterparts to identify and screen containers that pose a risk at the foreign port of departure before they are loaded on board vessels bound for the U.S. CSI is implemented in 20 of the largest ports in terms of container shipments to the U.S., and at a total of 58 ports worldwide.

The [[Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection]] program allows pre-screened, low-risk travelers from Mexico to be processed through dedicated lanes. [[NEXUS (frequent traveller program)|NEXUS]] is a similar program on the country's northern border with Canada. Along both borders, CBP has implemented the [[Free and Secure Trade]], which utilizes transponder technology and pre-arrival shipment information to process participating trucks as they arrive at the border. An agreement with Canada allows CBP to target, screen, and examine rail shipments headed to the U.S.

==Enforcement Powers==
CBP has the authority to search outbound and inbound shipments, and uses targeting to carry out its mission in this area. Under Section 596 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930|Tariff Act]], CBP is required to seize and forfeit all merchandise that is stolen, smuggled, or clandestinely imported or introduced.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/19/1595a.html 19 U.S.C. 1595a(c)]</ref> CBP is also required to seize and forfeit controlled substances, certain contraband articles, and plastic explosives that do not contain a detection agent. In conjunction with the [[Department of State]] and the [[Bureau of the Census]], CBP has put in place regulations that require submission of electronic export information on [[U.S. Munitions List]] and for technology for the Commerce Control List. CBP uses advance information from the [[Automated Targeting System]] and the [[Automated Export System]] to identify cargo that may pose a threat. CBP also works with the Departments of State and Defense to improve procedures on exported shipments of foreign military sales commodities.

Merchandise may also be seized and forfeited if:

* Its importation is restricted or prohibited because of a law relating to health, safety or conservation;
* The merchandise is lacking a federal license required for the importation;
* The merchandise or packaging is in violation of copyright, trademark, trade name, or trade dress protections;
* The merchandise is intentionally or repetitively marked in violation of [[country of origin]] marking requirements; or
* The imported merchandise is subject to quantitative restrictions requiring a visa or similar document from a foreign government, and the document presented with the entry is counterfeit.

===Civil Penalties===
Section 592 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]] is the basic and most widely used customs penalty provision for the importation of goods.  It prescribes monetary penalties against any person who imports, attempts to import, or aids or procures the importation of merchandise by means of false or fraudulent documents, statements, omissions or practices, concerning any material fact.  Penalties may be applied even in situations where there is no loss of revenue.

Section 592 infractions are divided into three categories of culpability, each giving rise to a different maximum penalty:

* ''Fraud'', an act or omission done intentionally to defraud the United States Department of  Revenue.  The maximum civil penalty  for a violation is the domestic value of the merchandise in the entry or entries concerned.
* ''Gross negligence'', an act or omission with actual knowledge of, or wanton disregard for, the relevant facts and a disregard of section 592 obligations.  The maximum civil penalty is the lesser of the domestic value of the merchandise or four times the loss of revenue (actual or potential).  IF the infraction does not affect revenue, the maximum penalty is 40% of the dutiable value of the good.
* ''Negligence'', involving a failure to exercise due care in ascertaining the material facts or in ascertaining the obligations under section 592.  The maximum civil penalties are the same for gross negligence, except the lesser of ''twice'' the domestic value of the merchandise or twice the loss of revenue is used.  The penalty cannot exceed 20% of the dutiable value.

The [[Customs Modernization Act]] amended section 592 to apply existing penalties for false information to information transmitted electronically and allows Customs to recover unpaid taxes and fees resulting from 592 violations.  It also introduced the requirement that importers use "reasonable care" in making entry and providing the initial classification and appraisement, establishing a "shared responsibility" between Customs and importers, thus allowing Customs to rely on the accuracy of the information submitted and streamline entry procedures.  To the extent that an importer fails to use reasonable care, Customs may impose a penalty under section 592.

===Criminal Penalties===
In addition to the civil penalties, a criminal fraud statute provides for sanctions to those presenting false information to customs officers.<ref>18 U.S.C. 542</ref>  Section 542 provides a maximum of 2 years imprisonment, or a $5,000 fine, or both, for each violation involving an importation or attempted importation.

==History==
{{Inappropriate tone|date=November 2009}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

===U.S. Customs Service===
{{Main|United States Customs Service}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:US Customs.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs Inspectors, late 1800s]] -->
Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the [[American Revolutionary War]], the First [[United States Congress]] passed, and President [[George Washington]], signed the Tariff Act of July 4, 1789, which authorized the collection of duties on imported goods.  Four weeks later, on July 31, the fifth act of Congress established the [[United States Customs Service]] and its ports of entry.

For nearly 125 years, the U.S. Customs Service was the primary source of governmental funds, which paid for the nation's early growth and infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/toolbox/about/history/history.xml History of the U.S. Customs Service]</ref>  Purchases include the [[Louisiana]] and [[Oregon]] territories; [[Florida]],  Alaska, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; funding the [[National Road]] and the [[Transcontinental Railroad]]; building many of the United States' [[lighthouse]]s; and the [[U.S. Military]] and [[U.S. Navy|Naval]] academies.

In March, 2003, the Customs Service was dissolved to form part of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] as the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Division.

===Immigration and Naturalization Service===
[[Image:INS 1924.jpg|thumb|Immigration inspectors, circa 1924]]
Shortly after the [[American Civil War]], some states started to pass their own immigration laws, which prompted the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to rule in 1875 that immigration was a federal responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}  The [[Immigration Act of 1891]] established an Office of the Superintendent of Immigration within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. This office was responsible for admitting, rejecting, and processing all immigrants seeking admission to the United States and for implementing national immigration policy. "Immigrant inspectors", as they were called then, were stationed at major U.S. [[port of entry|ports of entry]] collecting manifests of arriving passengers. A "head tax" of fifty cents was collected on each immigrant.

In the early 20th century [[United States Congress|Congress]]'s primary interest in immigration was protecting American workers and wages <U+2013> the reason it had become a federal concern in the first place.  This made immigration more a matter of commerce than revenue; hence, in 1903, Congress transferred the Bureau of Immigration to the newly created [[Department of Commerce and Labor]].

After [[World War I]], Congress attempted to stem the flow of immigrants, still mainly coming from Europe, by passing laws in 1921 and 1924 limiting the number of newcomers by assigning a quota to each nationality based upon its representation in previous [[U.S. census]] figures. Each year, the [[U.S. State Department]] issued a limited number of [[visa (document)|visas]]; only those immigrants who had obtained them and could present valid visas were permitted entry.

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] moved the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] from the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] to the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in 1940.

===Reorganization (2003 to present)===
[[Image:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers]]
CBP became an official agency of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] on March 1, 2003, combining employees from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (specifically, immigration inspectors and the [[United States Border Patrol]]), and the [[United States Customs Service]].  This transformation was led by former Commissioner [[Robert C. Bonner]].

[[W. Ralph Basham]] was nominated to the post of Commissioner by President [[George W. Bush]] on January 30, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Basham had 28 years of experience as a law enforcement manager, including serving as the head of the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] and the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]].  He had also served as the chief of staff for the [[Transportation Security Administration]]. It is the largest federal law enforcement agency that works closely with [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI).

CBP is currently headed by Commissioner [[Alan Bersin]] who was placed by President [[Barack Obama]] on March 27, 2010 as a recess appointment. Bersin formerly served as the Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Special Representative for Border Affairs, informally known as the "Border Czar".

CBP officers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/careers/customs_careers/officer/ |title=CBP <U+2013> Career Descriptions |publisher=Cbp.gov |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> are federal law enforcement officers empowered to exercise the authority and perform the duties provided by law and Department of Homeland Security regulations, including making arrests, conducting searches, making seizures, bearing firearms, and serving any order or warrant. CBP officers defend against terrorist intrusion by identifying high risk individuals who are attempting to enter into the United States; stop criminal activities <U+2013> such as [[drug trafficking]], [[child pornography]] (including on computers, cell phones, and other electronic media), [[weapons trafficking]], and [[money laundering]] <U+2013> by inspecting vehicles and trucks; and prevent the illegal entry of individuals, the smuggling of prohibited goods, and other customs and immigration violations. Officers are armed with [[Heckler & Koch P2000]] pistols chambered in [[.40 S&W]], expandable [[baton (law enforcement)|batons]], and oleoresin capsicum [[pepper spray]].  In accordance with Public Law 110-161, CBP officers are covered under special law enforcement retirement, and all candidates must be referred for selection for this position before reaching their 37th birthday.

Officer candidates attend the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], in Glynco, Georgia for 20 weeks of paid training.  Candidate training consists of basic law enforcement skills, including Anti-Terrorism; Detection of Contraband; Interviewing; Cross-cultural Communications; Firearms Handling and Qualification; Immigration and Naturalization Laws; U.S. Customs Export and Import laws, Defensive Tactics; Arrest Techniques; Baton Techniques; Examination of Cargo; Bags and Merchandise; Border Search Exception; Entry and Control Procedures; Passenger Processing; and Officer Safety and Survival.  Those candidates selected for duty locations requiring Spanish may receive an additional 6 weeks of Spanish Language training.  Officers who additionally serve on CBP's [[SWAT|Special Response Team]] are trained for an additional six weeks with the U.S. Border Patrol Tactical Unit in [[Artesia, New Mexico]].  For more information on training, download FLETC Training PDF<ref>[http://www.fletc.gov/cotp.pdf FLETC.gov]</ref> and reference the specific program title of Bureau of Customs and Border Protection Integrated Training Program (BCBPI).

CBP Officers may begin their careers in any region for which they apply.  The duty region is selected during the application phase, and generally cannot be changed once selected.  Proficiency in Spanish is a duty requirement only for those stationed along southern border regions, although it is not a requirement before being hired. CBP Officers stationed along southern border regions will undergo Spanish language training before coming on duty.

The CBP Officer position is categorized as a "critical-sensitive" position in law enforcement.  For this reason, officer candidates must undergo a single scope background investigation before being appointed. In addition, officer candidates must undergo drug and medical examination, polygraph examination, physical fitness test, and video based interview during the pre-appointment phase.<ref>[http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/careers/customs_careers/officer/cass_faq.ctt/cass_q_a.doc CBP.gov]</ref>

Candidates must undergo a single scope background investigation before being appointed. In addition, the candidates must undergo drug and medical examinations and a video based interview during the pre-appointment phase.

===Border Patrol Agents (OBP)===
Border Patrol Agents<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/careers/customs_careers/border_careers/bp_agent/ |title=CBP <U+2013> Career Descriptions |publisher=Cbp.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> actively patrol the borders to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States.  Agents detect and prevent the smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States, along with apprehending those people found to be in violation of immigration laws.  Agents work to lower crimes and improve the quality of life in border communities.  In some areas Agents are deputized or have peace-officer status and use it to enforce local and state/territory laws.    

One of the most important activities for a [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol Agent]] is "line watch". This involves the detection, prevention and apprehension of [[terrorist]]s, illegal aliens and smugglers of both aliens and contraband at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position, following up leads, responding to electronic sensor television systems, aircraft sightings, and interpreting and following tracks, marks and other physical evidence. Some of the major activities are farm and ranch check, traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities.  

All agents complete a 55-day paid "Basic Academy" training at the "U.S. Border Patrol Academy" in [[Artesia, New Mexico]].  Training includes such topics as immigration and nationality laws, physical training (PT), weapons and marksmanship. For those needing Spanish language instruction, an additional 40 days may be required beyond the 55 days of Basic Academy training.  Border Patrol Agents must be willing to work overtime and varying shifts under arduous conditions, and be proficient in the carry and use of firearms.  They may also be sent on temporary assignments on short notice, or on permanent reassignments to any duty location.  All new agents begin their careers along the Southwest border, where a working knowledge of Spanish is required.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/careers/customs_careers/border_careers/application_process/bpa_hire_proces.xml |title=The Border Patrol Agent Hiring Process |publisher=CBP.gov |date=2005-09-28 |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref>

===Employee morale===
[[Image:CBP Officers pay tribute 2007.jpg|thumb|CBP officers at a ceremony]]

In July 2006, the Office of Personnel Management conducted a survey of federal employees in all 36 federal agencies on job satisfaction and how they felt their respective agency was headed. DHS (which includes CBP) was last or near to last in every category including;

* 36th on the job satisfaction index
* 35th on the leadership and knowledge management index
* 36th on the results-oriented performance culture index
* 33rd on the talent management index

The low scores were attributed to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within DHS. Based on the survey, the primary concerns are about promotion and pay increase based on merit, dealing with poor performance, rewarding creativity and innovation, and the inability of leadership to generate high levels of motivation in the workforce, recognition for doing a good job, lack of satisfaction with various component policies and procedures and lack of information about what is going on with the organization and complaints from the traveling public.<ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=nation_world&id=5017688 ABC7chicago.com: Homeland Security employees rank last in job satisfaction survey 2/08/07<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://narcosphere.narconews.com/story/2007/1/31/17296/1136 DHS memo reveals agency personnel are treated like "human capital"]</ref>

In June 2007, CBP Commissioner W. Ralph Basham announced to employees that the agency would be conducting 125 different focus groups in 12 different cities around the country to better understand their concerns as expressed in the Human Capital Survey. The agency is also going to give employees who are not a part of that focus group process an intranet virtual focus group where they can express their views and their concerns. The commissioner stated: "We are looking at this very seriously. We want to hear from the employees, we want to hear from these focus groups, we want to drill down on this survey." As 2011, more than four years after this statement was made, these focus groups have never been reported to have been held, nor have any plans been reported for them to be held in the future.

A November 2007 [[Government Accountability Office]] report showed that low staffing, training, and overwork is a large problem within CBP, and an average of 71 officers leave the service every two weeks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/13/AR2007111302007.html | work=The Washington Post | title=One Tired, Under-Trained, Overworked Face at the Border | first=Stephen | last=Barr | date=2007-11-14 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}</ref>

==Criticism==
[[National Public Radio]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' reported that CBP radiation-detection equipment at ports is better at detecting kitty litter than dangerous weapons, and that U.S. borders are so porous that congressional investigators carrying simulated nuclear materials have walked across unchallenged.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1796943 National Public Radio - Morning Edition 1/14/2008 DHS Still Dogged by Questions over Effectiveness.]</ref>

In an article entitled "DHS Decision-Making: Competence or Character?", James Giermanski states that the fundamental problem within CBP is that the agency has weak and sometimes flawed management. He says that DHS and CBP suffer from "seriously flawed decision-making", citing the "door only" policy, radio frequency identification technology, and lack of focus on exports which contain bombs.<ref>[http://www.csoonline.com/article/print/216953 DHS Decision-Making: Competence or Character?]</ref>

The agency's practice of performing internal document checks on buses and trains running entirely within U.S. territory has been called "coercive, unconstitutional, and tainted by racial profiling". <ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Nina|title=Border Sweeps in North Reach Miles Into U.S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/nyregion/30border.html|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2011-11-04|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62wGv5wrS|archivedate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

The [[United States Court of International Trade]] found that CBP improperly classified merchandise when it had untrained chemists testifying before the court. The court found that there were errors in the laboratory reports, that CBP destroyed the evidence, and the tests used by the chemist did not meet any [[Daubert]] Factors.<ref>[http://www.cit.uscourts.gov/slip_op/Slip_op01/Slip%20Op.%2001-98.pdf ''THOM S. ZANI D/B/A WHOLESALE ART & FRAME LTD., Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES, defendant''.]</ref>

During a federal court case for unlawful removal,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} CBP and [[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys cited the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Garcetti v. Ceballos]]'' (04-473), which ruled that CBP employees do not have protection from retaliation by CBP managers under the First Amendment of the Constitution. The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation. In response to the Supreme Court decision of ''Garcetti v. Ceballos'', the House of Representatives passed H.R. 985, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2007, and the Senate passed its version of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] (S. 274), which has significant bipartisan support.

Some in Congress, such as Senator [[Susan Collins]] (R-ME),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2005/feb/16/20050216-123422-2436r/ |title=Merger of ICE, CBP considered |accessdate=2008-07-31 |work=The Washington Times |date=February 16, 2005 }}</ref> have argued that the combined infrastructures of ICE, CIS and CBP should be merged into one agency called U.S. Border Enforcement Administration(BEA) followed by seven major offices: Office of Investigations, Office of Border Patrol, Office of Air and Marine Patrol, Office of Field Operations, Office of Agriculture, Office of Immigration Adjudications, and Office of Deportation and Removal.
