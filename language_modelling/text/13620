'''Carl Ivar Hagen''' (born 6 May 1944) is a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[politician]] and former Vice President of the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]]. He was the chairman of the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] from 1978 until 2006, when [[Siv Jensen]] replaced him as chairman of the party. Under his leadership he was the undisputed leader and centre of the party, and in many ways personally controlled its ideology and policies.

Hagen has since been regarded by both political scientists and political colleagues alike as one of the greatest politicians in Norwegian history, for his ability to build a hugely successful party up from scratch and significantly change Norwegian politics.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/article2400528.ece|title=- En av de st<U+00F8>rste i norsk politikk|first1=Vibeke|last1=Buan|first2=Olav|last2=R<U+00F8>li|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=2 May 2008|accessdate=11 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=dt/> He has sometimes popularly been nicknamed "King Carl," the title of his unauthorized biography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=2793399|title=Kong Carl og hans historie: Jan Ove Ekeberg og Jan Arild Snoen: <U+00AB>Kong Carl<U+00BB>|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|date=19 November 2001|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/artikler/kommentarer/29079/article/item/null|title=Kong Carls utfordring|first=Siri Hall|last=Arn<U+00F8>y|work=[[Klassekampen]]|date=18 November 2002|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=bt4506>{{citenews|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/innenriks/Kong-Carl-abdiserer-265883.html|work=[[Bergens Tidende]]|title=Kong Carl abdiserer|first=Olav|last=Garvik|date=4 May 2006|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He has been described as the first post-modern politician in Norway.<ref name=snl/>

===Early life and career===
Hagen was born to [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] Ragnar Hagen (1908<U+2013>1969) and accountant Gerd Gamborg (born 1914).<ref name=stor>{{cite web|url=http://www.stortinget.no/no/Representanter-og-komiteer/Representantene/Representantfordeling/Representant/?perid=CIH|work=Stortinget.no|title=Hagen, Carl I.

When he was seventeen years old, in 1961, he went as an apprentice at the [[Norwegian America Line]] ship ''MS Foldenfjord''.<ref name=aftgj/> In 1964, he was conscripted in the [[Norwegian Army]], and served as an engineer soldier at Eggemoen near [[H<U+00F8>nefoss]], and Maukstadmoen in [[Troms]].<ref name=aftgj/>

After this, he left Norway for [[England]]. Originally wanting to become an [[engineer]], he flunked [[mathematics]] in [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] and chose to study [[marketing]] and [[business studies]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] instead, earning a Higher National Diploma in Business Studies in 1968.<ref name=stor/><ref name=aftgj/> From being more reserved in his youngest days, he soon became a player in Northern English student politics. In 1967 he fought over the office of vice president of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]], though clearly lost, against [[Jack Straw]] (later [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP and [[Secretary of State for Justice]] of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]).<ref name=dt>{{citenews|url=http://dt.no/article/20090830/REPORTASJER/649071601|title=Superreserven Carl I.

He achieved [[Examen artium]] in 1963, and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies in 1968. Prior to dedicating his professional life to politics, Hagen was CEO at [[Tate & Lyle]] Norway from 1970 to 1974, [[Consultant]] of Finansanalyse from 1977 to 1979, and economic policy consultant in the oil industry from 1979 to 1981.<ref name=stor/>

===Politics and retirement===
[[File:Valg 2009 021.jpg|thumb|210px|Carl I. Hagen speaking at a rally in [[Oslo]] as the Progress Party "senior general" before the 2009 parliamentary election.]]
Hagen married Nina Aamodt (born 17 January 1945) in 1970, but got divorced in 1975, according to Hagen as a consequence of his political work. Together they had two children. After some years of [[cohabitation]], in 1983 he was married again, to [[Eli Hagen|Eli Aas]], herself also a [[divorcee]] and mother of two. She became Hagen's closest political co-worker and advisor through his political career.<ref name=snl/> Holding the title of secretary of the chairman, she also strongly influenced questions regarding the party organisation and personal affairs, in addition to being his media advisor.<ref name=db2003>{{citenews|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2003/02/08/361000.html|title=I takt for partiet|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Tore|last=Gjerstad|date=8 February 2003|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Being a controversial politician, he in August 2009 stated that he regarded the storm around the immigration debate as what had been the most troublesome issue for his family, and he has largely kept a privative personal life. As of August 2009, Carl I. has seven grand-children, and Eli four. After living in [[N<U+00F8>tter<U+00F8>y]] for years, they moved back to Oslo in 2006, and has a cabin in [[Sande, Vestfold]]. Otherwise his favorite musician is [[Elvis Presley]], and he enjoy playing [[golf]] and [[tennis]].<ref name=dt/>

Hagen is also noted for his recurrent vacationing in [[Spain]], and he and Eli bought a vacation house in the city of [[Torrevieja]] around 1998.<ref name=db2003/> One time he was even notably criticised by the President of Parliament, [[Thorbj<U+00F8>rn Jagland]], for staying too long in Spain for the Easter vacation. The area in Spain which houses a large number of Norwegians, especially pensioners, has been dubbed "Progress Party land" as a result of it traditionally being a stronghold for the party.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/magasinet/2006/05/02/465035.html|title=Helt p<U+00E5> h<U+00F8>yden|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Eirik|last=Alver|date=2 May 2006|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2009, Hagen was appointed "senior general" of the Progress Party, with the responsibility to establish senior branches of the party, and run electoral campaigns on more pension and less [[Islamisation]].<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/hagen-blir-eldregeneral-2581996.html|title=Hagen blir eldre-general|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|first=Gerhard|last=Helskog|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=20 January 2011|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

After ending his high-profile political career, he in 2009 started working for the [[public relations|PR]] agency [[Burson-Marsteller]], where he became among the company's highest priced lecturers.<ref name=vg179>{{citenews|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=584953|title=- Carl I.

== Political career ==
Hagen has explained that he lost faith in the [[Conservative Party of Norway|Conservative Party]] as an alternative to [[social democracy]] during the [[centre-right]] [[Borten's Cabinet|Cabinet of Borten]] (1965<U+2013>71) when taxes increased more so than under Labour, as well as the power of the state. He sought to reduce the power of the state over individuals, and the political views of Anders Lange were because of this appealing to him.<ref name=snl/>

Hagen started his political career as he was elected Deputy [[Member of Parliament]] from Oslo for [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange's Party]] in 1973. He had attended the founding meeting of the party at ''Saga kino'' in April, and was asked by [[Erik Gjems-Onstad]] if he wanted to stand for election for the party.<ref name=aftgj/> He however soon lost faith in Anders Lange, and along with some others in 1974 broke away and formed the short-lived [[Reform Party (Norway, 1974)|Reform Party]].<ref name=snl/><ref name="tv2frp">{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/frps-historie-2577871.html|title=FrPs historie|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|first=Kjetil|last=L<U+00F8>set|date=15 June 2009|accessdate=11 November 2009|language=Norwegian}}</ref> After the death of [[Anders Lange]] later the same year he replaced Lange as a regular MP. The newly formed Reform Party merged with Anders Lange's Party again already the next year.<ref name=snl/> In 1977 the party changed its name into the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], and Hagen was elected leader of the party at the 1978 national convention. As the party did not get any MP's into parliament in 1977, Hagen was away from parliament for four years, until being elected in again in 1981.
[[File:Carl I. Hagen 2009 3.jpg|thumb|210px|Carl I. Hagen speaking in [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]] in February 2009.]]

Hagen has been regarded as the first postmodern politician in Norway by [[Gudleiv Forr]], writing for the ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]''.<ref name=snl/> His early success has been attributed to his ability to use the [[Media (communication)|media]] through [[Populism|populist]] speech.<ref name=snl/> He also managed to moderate the profile of the party from the more vulgar tone of Anders Lange.<ref name=snl/> Though he identifies himself as a libertarian, his political practice has been regarded by political commentators of being populist.<ref name=snl/> His ability to balance different political directions, was regarded by Forr of displaying "his mastering of the role of being party leader."<ref name=snl/> Forr also claimed that Hagen has a talent of double communication, which has left the diverse voter group of the party with different impressions of the policies of the party, sometimes leading to internal schisms.<ref name=snl/> His success has also been attributed to his in many aspects [[cynical]] and somewhat [[ruthless]] leadership style, suspending and kicking out members of the party who deviated too much from his personal views.{{POV-statement|date=March 2011}}<ref name=bt4506/>

Hagen was elected into parliament for seven consecutive four-year periods from 1981, until he stepped down and decided not to run for the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]].<ref name=nrk196>{{citenews|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.6660806|title=Da Hagen spente beinkrok p<U+00E5> Willoch|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|first=Oddvin|last=Aune|date=19 June 2009|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In the periods from 1979 to 1982, 1987 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999 he was also a member of the Oslo city council.<ref name=tv2304>{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/carl-i-hagen-trekker-seg-1799614.html|title=Carl I. Hagen trekker seg|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|first=Anja Tho|last=Gunnersen|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> From 2005 to 2009, Hagen in addition held the office of Vice President of Parliament. Part of the decision not to run for re-election (which he made in 2007) apart from reaching the age of pension, was because Hagen had felt that he had been put on the sideline after he had retired from the office of chairman. Hagen also stated that he wanted more relaxation, and sought to perhaps receive some missions as a consultant.<ref name=tv2304/>

In March 2010 it was however speculated about his comeback into Norwegian politics, as "central Progress Party politicians" wanted him to stand for [[mayor]] in [[Oslo]]. Hagen himself did not entirely repudiate the thought, and stated that he missed politics, as well as himself, as he thought that politics had become boring without him.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/article2863387.ece|title=Vil ha Carl I.

==Political views, criticism and controversies==
===Populism===
The claim that the Progress party is populist dates back to a [[motion of no confidence]] in 1986 for the [[Norwegian Conservative Party|Conservative Party]] prime minister [[K<U+00E5>re Willoch]]. During the parliamentary election campaign in 1985, the Progress Party had promised not to contribute to a socialist government.<ref name=nrk196/> When the motion failed to pass - in part due to lack of support from the Progress Party - K<U+00E5>re Willoch explained it as "the unpredictability of Carl I. Hagen".

===Immigration and Islam===
Several times in Hagen's political career, he has been accused of playing on domestic fears of foreigners and immigrants. Largely because of his, for some, controversial views on immigration, the political opponents of the Progress Party has many times resorted to physical assaults on Hagen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/skole/klippdetalj?topic=nrk:klipp/398232|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|title=Egg mot SV-Kristin og FrP-Carl (2:00 min)|accessdate=2 April 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He is especially known for having presented several accusations against Muslims, and [[Islam]] as a religion.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article1097512.ece|title=Progress Party brochure sparks racism charges|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first=Jonathan|last=Tisdall|date=16 August 2005|accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=heg1>{{citenews|url=http://www.hegnar.no/okonomi/politikk/article234902.ece|title=Mener Hagen-bok krenker muslimer|work=HegnarOnline (NTB)|date=9 November 2007|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> In 2009 however, he received a "bridge builder" award from the Norwegian-Pakistani committee for the celebration of the [[Pakistan]]i [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|Independence Day]] in Norway, for his "strong engagement in integration politics."<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.nettavisen.no/nyheter/article2685926.ece|title=Hagen fikk pakistansk pris|work=[[Nettavisen]]|first=Kjetil|last=M<U+00E6>land|date=14 August 2009|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

====Levende Ord speech====
In July 2004, Hagen delivered a speech at a convention of the independent Christian organisation ''Levende Ord'', where he stated that "we [[Christian]]s are very much concerned with children. [[Jesus]] said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that [[Muhammad]] could have said the same. In the case that he could have said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." He also stated that if [[Israel]] lost the fight in the [[Middle East]], Europe would bow under to [[Islam]], if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. "They have, in the same manner as [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into [[Africa]], and have come a long way into Europe <U+2013> and then we have to fight back." He was because of this speech criticised by politicians, religious leaders and other public personalities within Norway.<ref name=nrk137/> Some days later, the ambassadors of [[Pakistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Morocco]], and [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires|charg<U+00E9> d'affair]] of [[Tunisia]] made an unusual strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper [[Aftenposten]].<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article834865.ece|title=Ambassad<U+00F8>rer angriper Hagen|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first=Agnar|last=Kaarb<U+00F8>|date=24 July 2004|accessdate=17 September 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===Media===
While Hagen is known for being available when asked for by the media, he has generally been very critical of the media and has used it to his advantage.{{Lopsided|date=March 2011}} He notably gave the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], abbreviated NRK, the nickname "ARK", a pun meant to be understood as the "Labour Party Broadcasting Corporation," stating the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, and other media, to be largely unfavorable of the Progress Party.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/carl-i-hagen-blir-prraadgiver-2911949.html|title=Carl I.

He claimed that the Norwegian media had been able to control the election campaign more than before, regarding who they interrupt during debates, which issues they choose to ask the different parties about, and who they invite to join debates.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/innenriks/politikk/valg09/bitter-carl-i-hagen-skylder-paa-media-2907096.html|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|title=Bitter Carl I.

==Books==
===''<U+00C6>rlig talt: Memoarer 1944-2007'' (2007)===
''<U+00C6>rlig talt'' was mainly written as Hagen's personal [[memoir]]s, and particularly described his political career. According to ''[[Cappelen Damm]]'', Hagen writes "openly about his strategic choices, about central political processes, conflicts and victories - and about how they formed him and the party." He was also described as an "experienced and outspoken politician" who in his book was "hard-hitting, straight to the chase - and with continued willingness and ability to provoke."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cappelendamm.no/main/Katalog.aspx?f=1003&isbn=9788202260774|work=[[Cappelen Damm]]|title=<U+00C6>rlig talt|accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref> The book also contains, among other things, Hagen's personal characterisations of several political opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Carl_I._Hagen|title=Carl I Hagen|work=[[Store norske leksikon]]|accessdate=15 December 2010|date=17 September 2009|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Hagen started the presentation of his book by talking about circumstances in the 2001 [[Terje S<U+00F8>viknes]] sex-scandal. In the book, he also compared what he saw as a similar na<U+00EF>vety in the modern Norwegian immigration policy, and [[Neville Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain's]] failed negotiations with [[Adolf Hitler]] in the prelude to the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2007/10/31/516803.html?1193844468#1193844468|title=<U+00AB>Er jeg egentlig en drittsekk og rasist?<U+00BB>|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Harald S.|last=Klungtveit|date=31 october 2007|accessdate=27 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> When discussing the aftermath of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], he wrote that the management by the Norwegian government led [[freedom of speech]] to be "subordinated to the respect for the warlord, man of violence and female abuser [[Muhammad]], who murdered and accepted rape as a conquest technique."<ref name=heg1/> This was criticized by the Islamic Council Norway for "insulting Muslims," a reaction Hagen considered to be "as expected."<ref name=heg1/> He also described how he believed the ''[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]'' to be a tool for [[socialist]]s.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2007/11/01/516897.html|title=- Hagen er u<U+00F8>nsket i NRK|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Joakim|last=Thorkildsen|date=1 November 2007|accessdate=27 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

===''Klar tale'' (2010)===
''Klar tale'' is a debate book, where Hagen wrote his personal opinions. In the book, Hagen claimed that the policies used by the socialist parties were destroying the welfare state, by using poor solutions. He devoted much space to critizise [[The budgetary rule]] (''handlingsregelen''), which he claimed was preventing the development in Norway. He also critizised Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg's "bragging" of Norway having the lowest unemployment figures in Europe after the financial crisis, which Hagen saw as obvious, given Norway's oil wealth.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.frp.no/Klar+tale+fra+Carl.d25-TwZzQYr.ips|work=Frp.no|title=Klar tale fra Carl|first=David|last=Lande|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=25 December 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

Hagen also discussed possible difficulties in potential government cooperation between the Progress and Conservative Party. He cited conflicts among "strong individuals" in both parties. Politically, he warned the Progress Party particularly against "giving in" regarding the immigration policy, which he said was one of the most important issues for the party, and that the party in such a scenario would fall rapidly in polls, and lose credibility.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=10025941|title=Hagen svartelister H<U+00F8>yre-topper |work=[[Verdens Gang]]|first=Erlend|last=Skevik|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> He also believed that "if nothing is done," Norway risk the emergence of "a [[Roseng<U+00E5>rd]],"<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.7351861|title=<U+2013> Norge vil f<U+00E5> sitt Roseng<U+00E5>rd|work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=25 October 2010|first=Vilje|last=Helljesen|accessdate=27 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref> and proposed for volunteers to take care of [[asylum seeker]]s instead of the state, which he in turn believed would "likely rapidly stop the flow of asylum seekers to Norway."<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article3873166.ece|title=Hagen vil la frivillige ta asyl-regningen|work=[[Aftenposten]]|first1=Gunnar|last1=Magnus|first2=Lars|last2=Akerhaug|date=25 October 2010|accessdate=27 November 2010|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

He also rejected the notion of man-made climate change, which he called the "climate hoax," citing the 3-4 percentage of human produced [[CO2]] to hardly be significant to general climate changes. He also proposed for the Progress, Labour and Conservative Party to agree on increasing the electoral [[threshold]] to five percent, so that three to five of the smaller parties could possibly disappear.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.tv2.no/gmn/carl-i-hagen-klimaendringene-er-ikke-menneskeskapte-3312949.html|work=[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]]|title=Carl I.
