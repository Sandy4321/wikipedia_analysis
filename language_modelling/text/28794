'''Forrest Highway''' is a {{convert|95|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[highway]] in [[Western Australia]]'s [[Peel (Western Australia)|Peel]] and [[South West (Western Australia)|South West]] regions, extending [[Perth]]'s [[Kwinana Freeway]] from east of [[Mandurah, Western Australia|Mandurah]] down to [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]]. '''Old Coast Road''' was the original Mandurah<U+2013>Bunbury route, dating back to the 1840s. Part of that road, and the '''Australind Bypass''' around [[Australind, Western Australia|Australind]] and [[Eaton, Western Australia|Eaton]], were subsumed by Forrest Highway. The highway begins at Kwinana Freeway's southern terminus in [[Ravenswood, Western Australia|Ravenswood]], continues around the Peel Inlet to [[Lake Clifton, Western Australia|Lake Clifton]], and heads south to finish at Bunbury's Eelup Roundabout. There are a number of [[at-grade intersection]]s with minor roads in the shires of [[Shire of Murray|Murray]], [[Shire of Waroona|Waroona]], and [[Shire of Harvey|Harvey]] including Greenlands Road and Old Bunbury Road, both of which connect to [[South Western Highway]] near [[Pinjarra, Western Australia|Pinjarra]].

The settlement of Australind by the [[Western Australian Land Company]] in 1840<U+2013>41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. A coastal Australind<U+2013>Mandurah route was completed by 2 November 1842. Though the road was rebuilt by convicts in the 1850s, its importance was already declining. With a new road via Pinjarra at the foothills of the [[Darling Scarp]] completed in 1876, and the opening of the Perth<U+2212>Bunbury railway in 1893, few people travelled up the old coastal road. In the late 1930s there was a proposal to re-establish the road as a tourist route, which could also reduce traffic on the main road along the foothills, but it was put on hold due to World War II. Improvements to Old Coast Road started in the early 1950s, but with little progress made until 1954 when the [[Main Roads Western Australia|Main Roads Department]] approved [[Australian pound|<U+00A3>]]1000 worth of works. The name "Old Coast Road" was formally adopted on 27 January 1959, and a [[sealed road]] was completed in September 1969.

Since the 1980s, the state government has been upgrading the main Perth to Bunbury route, by extending Kwinana Freeway south from Perth, and constructing a [[dual carriageway]] on Old Coast Road north of Bunbury, including bypasses around Australind and [[Dawesville, Western Australia|Dawesville]]. A bypass was also planned around Mandurah, which underwent detailed environmental reviews and assessments in the 1990s and early 2000s. Construction of the New Perth Bunbury Highway project, which became Forrest Highway and the final Kwinana Freeway extension, began in December 2006, and the new highway was opened on 20 September 2009. Within one year of opening, the number of road accidents in the area had decreased significantly, but tourism and businesses in the towns on bypassed routes were also affected. There are few services alongside the highway, although {{as of|lc=y|June 2014}} a pair of roadhouses are under construction near Greenlands Road. In that same month, Forrest Highway was extended south to Bunbury by renaming much of Old Coast Road as well as Australind Bypass as part of the highway.

== History ==

===Background===
Following the establishment of the [[Swan River Colony]], the earliest report of exploration of the district around what is now Bunbury is from Lieutenant H. W. Bunbury in December 1836. The route he <U+2013> and later others <U+2013> took was slow and hazardous, taking four days to cover around {{convert|80|mi}}, and crossing four rivers. The route began with passage from [[Perth]] to [[Pinjarra, Western Australia|Pinjarra]], before turning south-west and passing through low, open scrubland, and a medium-timbered area with low marshes. The first river to cross was the [[Harvey River]], which could only be forded by horses at a single point, near the river mouth. Continuing south-westward, the northern tip of [[Leschenault Estuary]] was reached, and its shores followed before curving around into Bunbury. The last stretch of approximately {{convert|12|mi}} was the most dangerous for many years, as it required precarious crossings at the Collie and Preston Rivers.<ref name=Perry>{{cite thesis |last1=Perry |first1=Nancy K. |title=History and Present Potentialities of the Old Coast Road from Mandurah to Bunbury |date=1956 |url=http://library.ecu.edu.au:2082/record=b1400338~S7 |publisher=[[Claremont Teachers College]]}}</ref>{{rp|1<U+2013>2}}

[[File:A view of Koombana Bay 1840.jpg|thumb|1840 depiction of Koombana Bay, Port Leschenault. Settlement around this area prompted the first real need for a good quality road.]]
In an initial attempt to settle the area, the government declared the land open for [[pastoral]] settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, and most of those were in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault).<ref name=Perry />{{rp|2}} The settlement of Australind by the [[Western Australian Land Company]] in 1840<U+2013>41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth.<ref name=Perry />{{rp|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47847318 |title=Coast Road Becomes Ghost Road |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth, WA |date=13 May 1950 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |page=20 |via=[[NLA Trove|Trove]] (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury.

In a letter dated 12 June 1842 in the [[Colonial Secretary of Western Australia|Colonial Secretary]]'s Records, [[Marshall Clifton]], Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, wrote of the need for an improved Perth<U+2013>Fremantle<U+2013>Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor [[John Hutt]] approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.<ref name=Perry />{{rp|7<U+2013>8}}

During the winter of 1842, the existing route became impassable, and Clifton undertook the creation of the proposed coastal route.

It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. The ferry was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or leasing out the ferry.<ref name=Perry />{{rp|10}} The government later appropriated the ferry on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock.

From 30 June 1868, the government discontinued the ferry's operation and the position of caretaker, leaving travellers to work the ferry themselves. The news was not well received, with newspaper letters complaining of the great inconvenience to the users of the shorter coastal route. As a result, the government reappointed a caretaker on 30 March 1869.<ref name=Perry />{{rp|15<U+2013>16}} In 1894 the ferry was finally abandoned in favour of a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} wooden bridge adjacent to old ferry jetties, which was built by contract at a cost of <U+00A3>1700.<ref name=Perry />{{rp|16}} However, following the completion of the Perth<U+2013>Bunbury railway in 1893, few people travelled up the coast road.

The [[Bunbury Road Board]] supported the idea, with the beauty and pleasure of the route discussed at a meeting of the road board in January 1939; the lack of a proper [[road surface]] was seen as the only obstacle.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article148931034 |title=Coastal Road |newspaper=[[South Western Advertiser]] |location=Perth, WA |date=27 January 1939 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=7 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> Traffic was predicted to grow over the next five years to an extent that would justify a second route to Perth,<ref name="Bunbury's Requirements">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46408202 |title=Bunbury's Requirements |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=15 July 1939 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=4 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> particularly as the traffic volume on the existing inland road was already heavy and causing accidents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46378351 |title=South-West Tourist Traffic |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=30 March 1939 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=18 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> The Minister for Works, [[Harry Millington (politician)|Harry Millington]], considered the proposal in July 1939,<ref name="Bunbury's Requirements" /> and by early 1940 a number of rumours emerged regarding the imminent commencement of works; however, the [[Main Roads Western Australia|Main Roads Department]] had no intention to undertake them.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article149053889 |title=No Work On Coast Road |newspaper=South Western Advertiser |location=Perth, WA |date=2 February 1940 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=1 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> The Harvey Road Board decided to refrain from pursuing the matter until [[World War II]] had concluded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46722090 |title=Country News |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=20 June 1940 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=13 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> By 1943, vegetation was overgrowing the road, making it difficult to spot in places,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38552346 |title=The Old Coast Road |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth, WA |date=30 December 1943 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=28 |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> and in December 1946 about {{convert|200|yd}} was inundated by water {{convert|spell=in|1|ft|cm|adj=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46249141 |title=Old Coast Road |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=18 December 1946 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=6 |edition=Second |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> Negotiations between Main Roads and the road boards recommenced in 1947,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46269670 |title=The Old Coast Road |newspaper=The West Australian |location=Perth, WA |date=14 March 1947 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |page=17 |edition=Second |via=Trove (National Library of Australia)}}</ref> and by October 1948 the provision of a suitable road was costed at <U+00A3>280,000.

====Australind Bypass====
The {{convert|20.5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} Australind Bypass was constructed in the 1980s to relieve pressure on Old Coast Road,  and improve local amenity. The bypass travelled to the east and south of Australind and Eaton, to connect to Bunbury's Eelup Roundabout via an alignment previously part of Jubilee Road. There were slight deviations in the route to protect remnant [[paperbark]] trees, [[tuart]]s, [[acacia]], and aquatic plants, as well as a site of aboriginal importance, identified by botanical and aboriginal heritage surveys.<ref name="WR bypass" /> Australind Bypass was built in two stages by the Bunbury Division of Main Roads. The first stage opened on 11 December 1987, and was a {{convert|4.7|km|adj=on}} length from Eelup Roundabout to Eaton Drive, plus a {{convert|2|km|adj=on}} link from the bypass (north of the rail line) and the Collie River bridge on Old Coast Road.

=== New Perth Bunbury Highway===
While Old Coast Road's dual carriageway was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment would result in a [[traffic bottleneck]] through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the [[Peel Inlet]] in the 1980s.<ref name="Ecologia PER">{{Cite book |author1=Ecologia Environmental Consultants |author2=Main Roads Western Australia |title=Perth Bunbury Highway, Peel Deviation: Public Environmental Review |date=January 1997 |publisher=Environmental Protection Authority |location=Perth, WA |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22424972 |pages=iv, 1, 6, 7}}</ref>

The proposed Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part of which later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997,<ref name="Ecologia PER" /> and an environmental assessment by the [[Environmental Protection Authority of Western Australia|Environmental Protection Authority]] (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, ''[[Lasiopetalum|Lasiopetalum membranaceum]]'', near the southern end of the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy.

Forrest Highway has been criticised for the lack of roadside facilities. In January 2014, it was described as "the busiest, most unserviced, long stretch of highway in the nation" by MP [[Murray Cowper]], Member for [[Electoral district of Murray-Wellington|Murray-Wellington]].<ref name="TheWest MP pushes">{{cite news |last1=Acott |first1=Kent |title=MP Pushes For A Roadhouse |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/20756456/mp-pushes-for-a-roadhouse/ |accessdate=6 June 2014 |work=The West Australian |date=15 January 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140606012524/https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/20756456/mp-pushes-for-a-roadhouse/ |archivedate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{cite archives |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VcBwEULd |archivedate=16 January 2015}}</ref> With toilets only available at the John Tognela Rest Area near the southern end of the highway, travellers have reportedly stopped alongside the highway or side roads to urinate and change [[nappies]].<ref name="MCT Cowper leads" /><ref name="TheWest MP pushes" /> A farming family with property adjacent to the highway was willing to invest in a roadhouse near [[Herron Point, Western Australia|Herron Point]], but Main Roads required roadhouses to be built on both sides of the highway. According to Cowper, traffic volume would need to increase from 17,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day to justify such an investment.<ref name="MCT Cowper leads" />

A few months later, in April 2014, a Perth developer had begun constructing twin roadhouses {{convert|spell=in|5|km}} south of Greenlands Road, approximately halfway between Perth and Bunbury. The property was purchased in 2004, before construction began on the highway, with the intention of developing the site when there was a viable amount of traffic. The main tenant will be a national fuel retailer, with food and beverage retailers and other amenities to be located on both sides of the highway. The facilities were initially expected to be completed by the end of 2014,<ref>{{cite news |title=$20m Twin Roadhouses To Be Built On Forrest Highway |url=http://www.bunburymail.com.au/story/2207928/20m-twin-roadhouses-to-be-built-on-forrest-highway/ |accessdate=6 June 2014 |work=Bunbury Mail |date=9 April 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140606021721/http://www.bunburymail.com.au/story/2207928/20m-twin-roadhouses-to-be-built-on-forrest-highway/ |archivedate=6 June 2014 |deadurl=no}} {{cite archives |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VcC6Kgih |archivedate=16 January 2015}}</ref> but work has been put on hold due to a legal dispute between the developer and landowner.

On 5 June 2014, the [[Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia|Geographic Names Committee]] decide to rename the roads that connect Forrest Highway to Bunbury <U+2013> part of Old Coast Road as well as Australind Bypass <U+2013> as part of the highway. The renaming had been proposed in 2013 due to public confusion over the three names used for the route to Bunbury: Forrest Highway to Lake Clifton, Old Coast Road from there to north of Australind, and then Australind Bypass. Emergency services had difficulty locating incidents due to the confusion.<ref name="SOD appendices">{{cite web |title=Appendices |work=Ordinary Meeting To Be Held Wednesday, 27 November 2013 |url=http://www.dardanup.wa.gov.au/files/2014/06/2013-11-27-ORDINARY-APPENDICES.pdf |publisher=Shire of Dardanup |accessdate=2 August 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140308153238/http://www.dardanup.wa.gov.au/_content/Documents/Council/Ordinary%20Meeting/Ordinary%20Meeting%20Appendices%202013%2011%2027 |archivedate=8 March 2014 |deadurl=no |page=2 |format=PDF}} {{cite archives |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VcCNSDD8 |archivedate=16 January 2015}}</ref> The renaming followed similar changes to Main Roads' internal-use designations in May 2011, which deprecated Perth Bunbury Highway (Highway H2) in favour of Melville Mandurah Highway (Highway H2) for the portion north of Mandurah, Lakeland Lake Clifton Road (Main Road M74) for the Mandurah to Lake Clifton section together with [[Mandjoogoordap Drive]], and an extension of Forrest Highway (Highway H57) for the Lake Clifton to Bunbury portion.<ref name="network changes" /> Changes to the road signs were expected to be completed by mid-July.
