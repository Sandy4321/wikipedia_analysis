'''Arthur "Art" Farrell''' (February 8, 1877 <U+2013> February 7, 1909) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] player, author and businessman. Farrell played for [[Coll<U+00E8>ge Sainte-Marie de Montr<U+00E9>al|St. Mary's College]] in the 1890s and later the [[Montreal Shamrocks]] in the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey League]]. Born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Farrell helped lead the Shamrocks to [[Stanley Cup]] victories in 1899 and 1900.

He wrote the first ever book on ice hockey, ''[[Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game]]'', published in 1899 and of which only four remaining copies are known to exist in the world. He went on to write two "how-to" books on hockey: ''Ice hockey and ice polo guide'' of 1901-1904 and ''How to play Ice Hockey'', published in 1907.

==Personal life==
Farrell was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the son of William Farrell and Mary Meagher. He was the fourth child of eight. His father was a successful businessman and Montreal [[alderman]].<ref name="dict-bio"/>

After leaving hockey in 1901, Farrell went into his father's business firm and wrote books on ice hockey, revising his 1899 book for the American market.<ref name="dict-bio"/> Farrell fell ill with [[tuberculosis]] in 1906, and entered the sanatorium in [[Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts]], where he died in 1909.  He was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1965,{{sfn|Hockey Hall of Fame|p=68}} along with his teammate [[Fred Scanlan]], as a player.

==Playing career==
Farrell studied and played ice hockey at [[Coll<U+00E8>ge Sainte-Marie de Montr<U+00E9>al|St. Mary's College]] from 1895 until 1897. While there, he met future Shamrocks' players [[Harry Trihey]], [[Fred Scanlan]] and [[Jack Brennan (ice hockey)|Jack Brennan]]. In 1897, the four joined the Montreal Shamrocks. Farrell, along with Trihey, Scanlan and Brannen would form an impressive offensive line for the Shamrocks. (In those days, four forwards played as a line, including a rover.) The Shamrocks would win their league championship and the Stanley Cup in 1899 and 1900. The group played one more season together with the Shamrocks, then all four (and in fact the entire team) left the Shamrocks and Farrell and Trihey left competitive play entirely.
