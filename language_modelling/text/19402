'''Hudson Terminal''' was an urban railway station on the [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], New York City,<ref name="abandoned">[http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/hudterm.html Hudson Terminal] Abandoned Station Author: Joseph Brennan Accessed April 6, 2001</ref> and the office skyscraper built to serve the terminal.

== Station == 

The station was served by two single-track tubes connected by a loop to speed train movements. The loop included five tracks and 3 platforms (2 center island and one side) and is somewhat similar to the current arrangement.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rails Under the Mighty Hudson |author=Cudahy, Brian J. |publisher=Fordham University Press |date=2002 |pages=59<U+2013>60}}</ref> By 1914, passenger volume at the Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually.<ref name="droege"/> Volume nearly doubled by 1922, with 59,221,354 passengers that year at the Hudson Terminal.<ref>{{cite news |title=315,724,808 Came or Left City in 1922 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A16FE3C5416738DDDAC0994DC405B838EF1D3 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 15, 1923 |page=E1 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

The terminal opened with its first train service July 19, 1909 (marking the first use of the [[Downtown Hudson Tubes]]), and it closed in 1971, when the WTC station opened.<ref name="abandoned"/>

The Hudson Terminal building was an architectural and engineering marvel of its time.  In size, location, function and configuration it was the predecessor to the [[World Trade Center]].  

The Terminal included two 22-story buildings located above the station, at 30 and 50 Church Street, between Greenwich, Cortlandt, Church, and Fulton Streets.  This combined rail terminal and office block was the first of its kind in any city.<ref>The Port of New York:  A History of the Rail and Terminal System from the Beginnings to Pennsylvania Station, Carl Condit, 1980, pg. 254</ref>  The two buildings were identically designed, apart from the southern building's larger footprint and floor plan.  Both had rooftop gardens.  Dey Street ran between the two (the city wouldn't allow it to be closed), and they were connected by a third-story bridge.  

Underneath Dey Street and connecting the two structures lay three subterranean stories:  a concourse with access to ticket offices, waiting rooms, and commuter retail; the second underground level for five train tracks and elevated platforms; the lowest level for baggage and an electrical substation.  The concourse was carefully planned and designed with a system of ramps descending from the street level to the mezzanine, to allow an unprecedented volume of pedestrian traffic to flow in and out of the station quickly and easily.<ref name="droege">{{cite book |title=Passenger Terminals and Trains |author=Droege, John Albert |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1916 |pages=157<U+2013>159}}</ref>  According to Sarah Bradford Landau, "At full capacity the Hudson Terminal could accommodate 687,000 people per day; in comparison, [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)#Original structure (1910<U+2013>1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] (1902<U+2013>1910) was designed with a capacity of 500,000."<ref>Rise of the New York Skyscraper: 1865<U+2013>1913 By Sarah Bradford Landau, Carl W.

The architect was James Hollis Wells of [[Clinton and Russell]], and the construction contractor was [[George A. Fuller]].<ref>Rise of the New York Skyscraper: 1865<U+2013>1913 By Sarah Bradford Landau, Carl W. Condit, page 326</ref>  

With a total rentable floor space of {{convert|877,900|sqft|m2}}, some of which was taken by the railroad, <ref>The Port of New York:  A History of the Rail and Terminal System from the Beginnings to Pennsylvania Station, Carl Condit, 1980, pg. 254</ref> Hudson Terminal was billed as the largest office building in the world by floor area.<ref>New York Times, December 23, 1906</ref>  The previous record holder was the [[Ellicott Square Building]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], opened in May 1896 with 447,000 rentable square feet; the record held only until 1913, with the first occupation of the [[Manhattan Municipal Building]], with just under one million square feet of space.  

The two Hudson Terminal buildings were acquired in the 1960s by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] and demolished as part of the development of the [[World Trade Center]].
