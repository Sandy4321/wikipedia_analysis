The first [[HarperCollins]] novel, ''Emily the Strange:  The Lost Days'', was released in June, 2009.  Written in a diary format, it opens with Emily attempting to recover her memory and regain her sense of style. Co-Author, Rob Reger says the book maps new territory inside the mind of his popular character. <U+201C>In the past, it<U+2019>s been us describing her,<U+201D> he says. <U+201C>This is the first time anybody gets to hear how she talks to herself and her cats.<U+201D> [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203658504574191551545139022.html].

The next book in [[HarperCollins]]' four book series, ''Emily the Strange: Stranger and Stranger'', was released in March, 2010. In this book Emily is back in Blandindulle and preparing to move to a new town. While experimenting with her supply of Black rock and duplicating device she accidentally clones herself. Enjoying the benefit of a second Emily at first, the real Emily comes across problems such as identity crisis, loss of some of her unique talents, and an increase in nose picking. Not to mention the fact that her clone thinks ''she's'' the real Emily and evidently plans to end Emily Strange for good.

The third [[HarperCollins]] book, ''Emily the Strange: Dark Times'' was released on December 28, 2010. Emily is in Duntztown when she needs a student ID to obtain a discount at the local hardware store. After going to school and borrowing an ID, she decides to homeschool herself literally, as opposed to lying about it in the past two books. During a seminar "History of the Strange Family 101", Emily finds out that Great-Aunt Lily died by white fever at age 13, though she had healing powers and could probably heal herself. A rumor that a Dark Aunt caused her death is spreading too. Emily goes to Blackrock to find black rock for her Time Out Machine, only to find that Blackrock's not there and that the caravan is with her. She learns about Boris, Attikol's ancestor, and decides to time travel into 1790 to save Lily and take Boris off her tail using a moving, severed cat's tail.

The fourth and final [[HarperCollins]] book, ''Emily the Strange: Piece of Mind'' will be released December 27th, 2011. The teaser says it includes:

===Character origin controversy===

The very first Emily the Strange illustration dates from 1991, but the [[1978]] children's book ''[[Nate the Great|Nate the Great and the Lost List]]'' features a very similar illustration of a young girl named Rosamond. She also has long black hair and is frequently accompanied by her black cats. When Rosamond is introduced she wears a short dress and white Mary Jane shoes, similar to Emily, and in a similar pose.<ref>[http://www.boingboing.net/2008/12/03/emily-the-strange-is.html Emily the Strange is a rip off of a 1978 book character]</ref>

This illustration is accompanied by the text, "Rosamond did not look hungry or sleepy. She looked like she always looks. Strange." The first Emily the Strange design by Cosmic Debris says: "Emily did not look tired or happy. She looked like she always looks. Strange."

When Rosamond's creators, Marjorie Sharmat and Marc Simont, allegedly began contacting companies who had contracts related to Emily the Strange and urged them to drop their relationships with Cosmic Debris, Cosmic Debris sued Sharmat and Simont. Sharmat and Simont counter-sued.<ref>[http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/06/comics-am-the-comics-internet-in-two-minutes-95/ The Comics Internet in 2 Minutes]</ref> "Emily the Strange, like Rosamond, is a young girl in a short dress, black tights, and Mary Jane shoes. Emily, like Rosamond, has long dark hair with square-cut bangs. Emily, like Rosamond, is typically attended by four black cats. Emily, like Rosamond, is described as being strange and has a fascination with dark themes," alleged the complaint.

Cosmic Debris contended that Emily and Rosamond both drew from a tradition of similar characters including [[Vampira]] and [[Wednesday Addams]], and argued that while the text of the initial Emily illustration was nearly identical with Sharmat's text, that illustration had been withdrawn in 1998 and the statute of limitations had therefore run out.<ref>http://www.courthousenews.com/2009/05/20/CosmicDebris.pdf</ref>

On August 12, 2009, creator of Emily the Strange and the creators of Nate the Great jointly announced an agreement resolving all disputes between them. Each side agreed to give up all claims against the other as part of their settlement. "We recognize that Emily and Rosamond are both unique and original characters, and we are pleased that we were able to resolve this dispute," said Marjorie Sharmat and Marc Simont.  "We wish Rob, Cosmic Debris, Emily and her fans all the very best."<ref>[http://www.emilystrange.com/blog/index.cfm/2009/8/12/Emily-The-Strange-And-Nate-The-Great-Creators-Resolve-Dispute]</ref>
