'''Irwin Peter Russell''' (16 September 1921 &ndash; 22 January 2003) was a British [[English poetry|poet]], translator and critic. He spent the first half of his life<U+2014>apart from war service<U+2014>based in Kent and London, being the proprietor of a series of bookshops, editing the influential literary magazine [[Nine (literary magazine)|''Nine'']] and being part of the literary scene.  Bankruptcy and divorce led to several years of travel which took him to [[Berlin]], [[Venice]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Iran]], amongst other places.  After the [[Iranian Revolution]] he settled permanently in Italy, where he spent the rest of his life. He lived in considerable financial hardship and throughout all he lived a life dedicated to poetry.  His work never became mainstream, but it is highly regarded in some circles.

==Biography==
Russell was born in [[Bristol]] and educated at [[Malvern College]]. During [[World War II]] he served in the [[Royal Artillery]] as an intelligence officer in [[India]] and [[Burma]], he left the army with the rank of major. After the war, he studied English at Queen Mary College, London. He left without taking a degree.

In 1948 Russell set up an "Ezra Pound Circle' which met met once a fortnight in a London pub. [[Arthur Moore]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}} encouraged him, passing on advice from Pound: "E.P. thinks you might do as he used to half a century ago ... arrange to be at a given eating place at a given hour each week ... It must be cheap enough so anyone can afford it, and at a place where such a gathering would be made comfortable."<ref>Carpenter, p.786</ref> That summer Russell went to Italy and met [[Olga Rudge]] at [[Siena]], met Pound's friend John Drummond in [[Rome]], and visited [[Rapallo]] where he met [[D. D. Paige]] who was staying in Pound's old flat engaged in the arduous task of compiling the first selection of Pound's letters.<ref>Carpenter, p.786</ref>

In 1951 Russell married Marjorie Keeling-Bloxam.  Her brother-in-law was Albion Harman, son of the self-proclaimed king of [[Lundy]], the largest island in the Bristol Channel.  In the 1950s Russell often visited Lundy, and enjoyed bird-watching there.<ref>Burns, 'The Poet Odyssified'</ref>

In 1949 Russell founded the literary magazine ''Nine'' (named after the [[Nine Muses]]) which in its eleven issues published many notable poets including [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]], [[Basil Bunting]], [[Roy Campbell]], [[Ronald Duncan]], [[Paul Eluard]], [[William Empson]], [[David Gascoyne]], [[Robert Graves]], [[Michael Hamburger]]. The following year he started The Pound Press. Russell published work by Pound's friends, ''An Examination of Ezra Pound'' (1950), but also the first English translations of [[Mandelstam]], [[Pasternak]] and [[Borges]]. Russell ran the Grosvenor Bookshop in [[Tunbridge Wells]] from 1951 to 1959. Both ''Nine'' and the Pound Press ceased operation in 1956, and later that year Russell met the young [[William Cookson]] and in 1958 introduced him to Krystyna and Czes<U+0142>aw Bednarczyk of [[The Poets' and Painters' Press]]<ref>Cookson, editorial to Agenda Vol 32 Nos. 3 - 4.</ref> and suggested that Cookson found his own journal, which was to be the long-running [[Agenda (poetry journal)|''Agenda'']]. Russell introduced him to the works of [[Hugh McDiarmid]] and [[Tom Scott (poet)|Tom Scott]]. Cookson saw ''Agenda'' as in part a continuation of what Russell had done with ''Nine''.<ref>Cookson, in Alexander, p. 46</ref> In 1995 ''Agenda'' brought out one of its dedicated issues: 'A Tribute to Peter Russell'.

In 1959 the Grosvenor Bookshop went out of business, and he opened the Gallery Bookshop in [[Soho]], [[London]]. He finally went bankrupt in 1963 and with the collapse of his marriage, he moved to Berlin.  In 1965 he relocated to Venice. He had rooms in the Campo de la Bragola.

In the mid 1970s he held a writing fellowship as poet in residence at the [[University of Victoria]] in [[British Columbia]], where he met his second wife, Lana Sue Long, who was around 30 years his junior. Two daughters, Kathleen and Chris, were born to the couple in 1975 and 1976. After leaving Canada, the family moved to Tehran, where Russell taught and studied at the Imperial Academy of Philosophy.  Their third child, a son, Peter George, was born there in 1977. They remained in Iran until the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]], when they returned to Italy, where they lived together under considerable financial hardship.  In 1989 Lana returned with the three children to North America, settling in [[Jackpot, Nevada]], and the couple divorced in the 1990s. Tuscany was Russell's home for the last forty years of his life. In 1983 he moved into an old mill &mdash; "La Turbina" &mdash; in [[Pian di Sc<U+00F2>]], in the [[Valdarno]] near [[Arezzo]].  Life at the mill was rudimentary, and there was hardly any furniture, although there were thousands of books in a variety of languages, and a supply of whisky and cigarettes. Russell essentially lived in the kitchen, the most habitable and only warm room of the house.<ref>Pursglove, Obituary in ''Acumen'' 46</ref>

From 1990 her began editing the ''[[Marginalia Newsletter]],'' which appeared alternately in English (odd numbered issues) and Italian (even numbered issues). In the early 1990s he began working with his son, now a teenager, on the translations in his bilingual collections of his poems.

In April 2001 serious health problems associated with a gastric ulcer led to three months in hospital, followed by a further three months in a sanatorium for the elderly. Around this time he became effectively completely blind.<ref>Preface to ''Living Death''</ref>

Russell translated varied works from several European languages, he also worked in Persian and Arabic; he was the first English translator of [[Osip Mandelstam]]. His close friends included [[Kathleen Raine]] and [[Leonello Rabatti]]. He was a cousin of [[Bertrand Russell]]<ref>BBC Bristol, 23 January 2003 [http://www.innternet.de/~peter.patti/peterrussell1.htm]</ref>

He died in the hospital at [[San Giovanni Valdarno]], only 15 minutes or so by car from Pian di Sc<U+00F2>.

==Work==
[[Dana Gioia]] has described Russell as "a poet of striking contradictions. He is an immensely learned writer with an anti-academic temperament, a Modernist bewitched by classicism, a polyglot rooted in demotic English, an experimentalist in love with strict traditional forms, a natural democrat suspicious of the Left, and a mystic committed to clarity."<ref>[http://www.poetrysalzburg.com/psr-no4.htm Poetry Salzburg Review, No. 4], Spring 2003.
