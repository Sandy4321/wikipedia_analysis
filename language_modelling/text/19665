==Plot summary==
Astrid is twelve years old and living in [[California]]. She and her mother, poet Ingrid Magnussen, live a sheltered life together with little male influence. Ingrid was left by her husband, Klaus Anders, before Astrid was old enough to remember; she has never seen or spoken to her father. Astrid, like her mother, is beautiful.  She relies solely on Ingrid and has trouble fitting in at school. Ingrid, however, is self-centered, superficial, cold-hearted and eccentric. She lives by the maxim "Never let a man stay the night" and does not show interest in Astrid as a person, sometimes seemingly forgetting she has a daughter. Because of this, Astrid fears abandonment above all else.

Ingrid begins dating a man named Barry Kolker. Astrid watches as Ingrid and Barry become more and more involved, then she witnesses her mother's heartbreak when he is revealed to be a womanizer. Ingrid poisons Barry by breaking into his house and spreading [[Dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], an arthritis drug, all over the surfaces of Barry's home.  The drug absorbs through his skin and kills him.  She is charged with his murder and sentenced to over thirty years in prison. She promises her daughter that she will come back,  but Astrid is sent to a series of foster homes.

The first foster family is that of Starr, a former [[stripper]] and [[drug addict]].  She has two children of her own, Carolee and Davey, as well as a boyfriend, Ray.  This home, which seems suitable at first, is the first of many failures.  Despite being fourteen years old, Astrid has an affair with Starr's fifty year old boyfriend, Ray.  Suspicious and needy, Starr goes back to her old habit of heavy drinking.  One night, after loudly accusing Ray of having sex with the foster child, Starr shoots Astrid with a .38.  Although suffering some broken bones and stitches from the gun shot, Astrid is not fatally injured.

After recovery, her next home is with the Turlocks.  Ed and Marvel are an average couple and the parents of two young children.  In their home, Astrid becomes an unpaid babysitter.  While taking the kids to the park, she begins to smoke [[marijuana]], which she bought by trading sexual favors with local teenagers.  As an escape from Marvel's wrath, Astrid befriends the Turlocks' next-door neighbor, a beautiful African-American woman named Olivia Johnstone.  Astrid admires Olivia's beauty and her [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle, although she knows that Olivia, as a woman of complete independence, will never think the same of her.  Olivia is a prostitute by profession and is hated by the Turlock family. One night Astrid sneaks out of the Turlock house to see if Olivia was home but is attacked by dogs on the way there, leaving her with scars. Astrid's association with Olivia leads to her being expelled from the Turlock household after accidentally falling asleep at Olivia's house one night.

Next, Astrid is sent to the home of a [[Hispanic]] woman named Amelia Ramos. Amelia is an [[interior designer]], originally from [[Argentina]], and lives in [[Hollywood]], with a huge, elegant house. Amelia has a son, but he has [[AIDS]] and the girls do not see him much. The other foster girls in the house are all Latino and are racist towards Astrid because of her pale skin, light blue eyes, and white-blonde hair.  All the girls in Amelia's household, however, are treated the same in that they are fed dinner, but Amelia keeps a lock on her fridge so the girls starve in the mornings. Amelia even recommends a friend to take in girls, because they are "easy money." Astrid starves to the point that she stops menstruating. She resorts to eating unfinished lunches from the garbage at school.  Finally, with the help of a social worker, she is removed from Amelia's household.

With the next family, Astrid becomes the companion of a lonely young woman named Claire Richards, an actress with a workaholic husband, Ron.  Loving but weak, Claire does everything she can to ensure Astrid's comfort.  For once, Astrid has a regular schedule, is doing well in school and pursuing the art she loves.  All the while, Astrid continues corresponding with her mother in prison, but Astrid becomes increasingly bitter towards Ingrid. She settles easily into life with Claire. However, Claire suspects that Ron is having an affair, because of his frequent trips which he claims are for business purposes. Astrid watches their fights worsen as Ron makes constant trips away from home.  Claire falls deeper and deeper into depression and also communicates with Ingrid, whom she admires greatly. Ingrid convinces her that Ron is indeed having an affair. Later, Ingrid tells Astrid that deceiving Claire is too easy, "like drowning kittens." During [[Christmas]], Claire commits [[suicide]] by [[overdosing]] on pills. This leaves Astrid stuck with Ron. Ron lets Astrid stay, but Astrid declines and decides she'd be better off in an orphanage of sorts, MacLaren Children's Center (known as Mac), than with him.  Astrid meets a boy named Paul Trout in the children's center, and when they become friends and people speculate that they are a couple and begin mocking them.

Astrid's final home is with Russian immigrant Rena Grushenka. She intentionally chooses Rena over better prospective foster parents because she is devastated by Claire's death, and does not want to become part of a "normal" [[nuclear family]]. At Rena's, she befriends two other girls, the punker Niki, and pregnant, needy Yvonne.  As a reflection of her first foster home, she ends up sleeping with Rena's boyfriend, Sergei.

Meanwhile, Ingrid has begun to build up a following of fans and admirers from prison, who all believe she is innocent. Ingrid and her lawyer begin to build up a case to get Ingrid released from prison. However, their case depends on Astrid -- if she testifies that Ingrid did not murder Barry, Ingrid could probably get out, but if she testifies the truth, Ingrid could not win her case. Astrid realizes that she is in a position of power over her mother, and tells her that unless she answers some of her questions, she will testify against her. 

Astrid learns a lot about her past, including an incident when, as a very small child, she was left in the care of a neighbor named Annie for a year, while her mother abandoned her to live in [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]. She also learns about her father, Klaus Anders. She receives word from her mother's admirers and advocates, who are convinced that Ingrid is innocent. Knowing her mother is guilty, Astrid refuses to testify at first, but is soon convinced to lie to help free Ingrid.  However, when the case is brought up, Ingrid tells the court that she refuses to let Astrid speak on her behalf, even if she must carry out her long sentence. From this, Astrid knows that her mother is not completely selfish, and does bear true love for her.

After learning about her father, Klaus, she visits him briefly with his new family.  She does not feel the completion she once thought she would feel and sought.  Astrid moves from California to pursue an artistic career without her mother's art overshadowing her life.  She ends up in Berlin with Paul, who is now her boyfriend and an independent comic artist.  She creates suitcases that represent the various stages she has gone through since her mother was imprisoned, beginning with who she was with her mother, to who she became with each family she stayed with, each foster home, and experiences.  Together they are living the epitomized lifestyle of the "poor starving artist" traveling frequently from place to place.

Paul brings home a newspaper article reporting Ingrid's released from prison after winning her appeals trial.  Astrid acknowledges the power that her mother still has over her and even reveals her secret dreams of going back to California.  She never fufills this dream, knowing that too much has happened and she would never fit into the daughter mold her mother wants from her.  She also realizes that if she returns to California, she must abandon Paul, leaving him much like she has been abandoned so many times before.  She embraces the life she has lived, the past that has made her who she is and accepts her mother's love, but continues to live the life she leads.
