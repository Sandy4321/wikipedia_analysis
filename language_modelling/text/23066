'''Sahle Dengel''' was ''[[Emperor of Ethiopia|{{IPA|n<U+0259>gus<U+00E4> n<U+00E4>g<U+00E4>st}}]]'' of [[Ethiopia]] intermittently between [[1832]] and [[11 February]] [[1855]], towards the end of the [[Zemene Mesafint]] ("Era of the Princes"). He was the son of [[Gebre Mesay]], allegedly descendant of a younger son of Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]].

He was largely a figurehead, with real power in the hands of the ''Enderase'' or Regent, [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Ali II of Yejju|Ali II]] a princeling of the [[Oromo]] ruling family of the district of [[Yejju]]. [[Eduard R<U+00FC>ppell]], who visited the capital of [[Gondar]] in 1833, stated that at the time the Emperor "barely had the income of an averagely well-to-do Ethiopian, and the great princes of the [[Tigray Province|Tigrai]], [[Shewa|Shoa]] and [[Amhara]] were unable to prevent continuous strife and bloodshed."<ref>Edward Ullendorff, ''The Ethiopians'', second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 83.</ref>

When Sahle Dengel was set on the throne by Ras Ali, the clergy of [[Azazo]] disapproved of his religious beliefs, and convinced Ras Ali to remove him; Sahle Dengel was sent to [[Zengaj]]. Ras Ali recalled [[Gebre Krestos of Ethiopia|Gebre Krestos]] from Mesraha, an island in [[Lake Tana]], and restored him as Emperor. However, Gebre Krestos died after three months, and Sahle Dengel convinced Ras Ali to make him Emperor once again (October, 1832). About that same time, one [[Egwale Anbesa]] announced his claim to the throne; Sahle Dengel cut his head off, and set it in a tree at [[Adababay]].<ref>E. A. Wallis Budge, ''A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia'', 1928 (Oosterhout, the Netherlands: Anthropological Publications, 1970), p. 482</ref>

Following the death of Ras [[Kinfu]], the warlords fought for control of his lands in [[Gojjam]]. Eventually [[Mennen Liben Amede]] gained the upper hand, defeating and capturing [[Walda Tekle]], following which she deposed Sahle Dengel on [[29 August]] [[1840]] in favor of her husband [[Yohannes III of Ethiopia|Yohannes III]]; Yohannes offended Ras Ali by favoring his rival [[Wube Haile Maryam]], and Ras Ali restored Sahle Dengel in October [[1841]]. Yohannes somehow managed to get himself restored to the throne around 1850, only to be deposed again in 1851. Sahle Dengel was once again restored to the throne, and held it until [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]] consolidated Ethiopia under his control and declared himself Emperor.  Yohannes III also claimed the Imperial throne at the same time, and different areas recognized one or the other as titular Emperor until Tewodros II ended this situation.  Significantly, Yohannes III accepted the accession of Tewodros II.
