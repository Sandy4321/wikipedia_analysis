'''Warenar''' is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] play written by [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] in 1617, based on the play [[Aulularia]] by [[Plautus]]. Nowadays we assume that Hooft did not write it by himself, but that he was helped by his good friends Samuel Coster en Gerbrand Bredero, who are famous writers as well. 


==Plot==
The story's [[protagonist]], Warnar ('Ware Nar, or 'True Fool'), has inherited a pot of [[gold]] from his father, who inherited it from his father (Warnar's grandfather). Warnar is stingy with the inherited [[Wealth|fortune]], and keeps changing its hiding place, without spending any of the gold. Warnar's daughter, Claertje, is about to marry Warnar's [[neighbour]], Rijckert. However, Claertje is pregnant from Rijckerts [[nephew]], Ritsaert. Ritsaert offers to marry Claertje, instead of having Rijckert marry her. Both Rijckert and Warnar agree. In the meantime though, Lecker, one of Rijckert's [[Domestic worker|servants]] who helped to prepare a meeting for marriage agreements, has stolen the pot of gold. Ritsaert finds out, and tells Warnar, though. In a sudden plot twist (the last part of the original story by Plautus was lost), Warnar betters his life and gives the money to Claertje and Ritsaert as a [[wedding]] [[gift]].
