"'''Jack and Jill'''" (sometimes '''Jack and Gill''', particularity in earlier versions) is a traditional [[English language|English]] [[nursery rhyme]]. The [[Roud Folk Song Index]], classifies this tune and its variations as number 10266. The rhyme dates back at least to the 18th century and exists with different numbers of verses each with a number of variations. Several theories have been advanced to explain its origins and to suggest meanings for the lyrics.

==Lyrics and structure==
The first and most commonly repeated verse is:

:Jack and Jill went up the hill
:To fetch a pail of water.
:Jack fell down and broke his crown,
:And Jill came tumbling after.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/>

Many verses have been added to the rhyme, including a version with a total of 15 stanzas in a [[chapbook]] of the 19th century. The second verse, probably added as part of these extensions<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6>P. Opie and I. Opie,''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, OUP, 1997), ISBN 0198691114, pp.&nbsp;224&ndash;6.</ref> has become a standard part of the nursery rhyme.<ref name="Carpenter&Prichard1984p274">H. Carpenter and M. Prichard, ''The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), ISBN 0192115820, p. 274.</ref> Early versions took the form:

:Up Jack got, and home did trot,
:As fast as he could caper;
:To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob
:With vinegar and brown paper.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/>

By the early 20th century this had been modified in some collections, such as L. E. Walter's, ''Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes'' (London, 1919) to:

:Up Jack got and home did trot,
:As fast as he could caper;
:And went to bed and bound his head
:With vinegar and brown paper.<ref name=Walter1919>L. E. Walter, ''Mother Goose's Nursery Rhymes'' (1919, 1923, Forgotten Books), ISBN 1440072930, p. 8.</ref>

A third verse, sometimes added to the rhyme, was first recorded in a 19th century chapbook and took the form:

:Then Jill came in, and she did grin,
:To see Jack's paper plaster;
:Her mother whipt her, across her knee,
:For laughing at Jack's disaster.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/>

20th century versions of this verse include:

:When Jill came in how she did grin
:To see Jack's paper plaster;
:Mother vexed did whip her next
:For causing Jack's disaster.<ref name=Walter1919/>

The rhyme is in made up of [[quatrain]]s, with a rhyming scheme of ''abdb'' (with occasional internal rhymes), using falling rhymes (where the rhyme sound is on a relatively unstressed syllable: de-emphasising the rhyme) and a [[trochaic]] rhythm (with the stress falling on the first of a pair of syllables), know as a [[ballad]] form, which is common in nursery rhymes.<ref>L.

==Meaning and origins==
The rhyme has traditionally been seen as a [[nonsense verse]], particularly as the couple go up a hill to find water, which is usually found at the bottom of a hill,<ref name=Jack2008/> however, vinegar and brown paper were a home cure used as a method to draw out bruises on the body.<ref name=Roberts>C. Roberts, ''Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: the Reason Behind the Rhyme'' (Colchester: Granta, 2nd edn., 2004), ISBN 1862077657, pp.&nbsp;137&ndash;40.</ref> The phrase "Jack and Jill", indicating a boy and a girl, was in use in England as early as the 16th century. A comedy was performed at the Elizabethan court in 1567-8 with the title ''Jack and Jill'' and the phrase was used twice by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]: in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which contains the line: "Jack shall have Jill; Nought shall go ill" (III:ii:460-2) and in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', which has the lines: "Our wooing doth not end like an old play; Jack hath not Jill" (V:ii:874<U+2013>5), suggesting that it was a phase that indicated a romantically attached couple, as in the proverb "A good Jack makes a good Jill".<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/> 

Jack is the most common name used in English language nursery rhymes and by the 18th century represented an archetypal Everyman [[jack (hero)|hero]],<ref>W. B. McCarthy and C. Oxford, ''Jack in Two Worlds: Contemporary North American Tales and their Tellers'' (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1994), ISBN 0807844438, p. xvi.</ref> while by the end of the Middle Ages Jill or Gill had come to mean a young girl or a sweetheart.<ref>G. A. Kleparski, "CDs, petticoats, skirts, ankas, tamaras and shielas" in C. Kay and J. J. Smith, eds, ''Categorization in the History of English'' (Amsterdam, 2004), ISBN 9027247757, p. 80.</ref> However, the woodcut that accompanied the first recorded version of the rhyme showed two boys (not a boy and a girl), and used the spelling Gill not Jill.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/> This earliest printed version comes from a reprint of [[John Newbery]]'s ''[[Mother Goose#"Old Mother Goose"|Mother Goose's Melody]]'', thought to have been first published in London around 1765.<ref>B. Cullinan and D. G. Person, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children's Literature'' (London: Continuum, 2003), ISBN 0826417787, p. 561.</ref> The rhyming of "water" with "after", was taken by [[Iona Opie|Iona]] and [[Peter Opie]] to suggest that the first verse may date from the first half of the 17th century.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/>

==Interpretation==
[[File:201008241206184375 M.jpg|thumb|upright|A postcard illustration of the rhyme by [[Dorothy M. Wheeler]], c. 1920. {{audio|201008241206184375 M.mid|Play}}]]
While the true origins of the rhyme are unknown, there are several theories. As is common with nursery rhyme [[exegesis]], complicated metaphors are often said to exist within the lyrics of Jack and Jill, most post-date the first publication of the rhyme and have no collaborative evidence.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/> These include the suggestion by [[S. Baring-Gould]] in the 19th century that the events were a version of the story told in the 13th-century [[Prose Edda]] ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' written by [[Iceland]]ic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]], who stated that in [[Norse mythology]], [[Hj<U+00FA>ki and Bil]], brother and sister (respectively), were taken up from the earth by the moon (personified as the god [[M<U+00E1>ni]]) as they were fetching water from the well called [[Byrgir]], bearing on their shoulders the cask called Saegr and the pole called Simul.<ref name=Opie1997pp224-6/> Around 1835 [[John Bellenden Ker]] suggested that Jack and Jill were two priests, and this was enlarged by Katherine Elwes in 1930 to indicate that Jack represented [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] (c.1471<U+2013>1530); and Jill was Bishop Tarbes who negotiated the marriage of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] to the [[Louis XII of France|French king]] in 1514.<ref>W. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring Gould, ''The Annotated Mother Goose'' (Bramhall House, 1962), pp.&nbsp;60&ndash;2.</ref> 

It has also been suggested that the rhyme records the attempt by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to reform the taxes on liquid measures. He was blocked by [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], so subsequently ordered that the volume of a Jack (1/2 pint) be reduced, but the tax remained the same. This meant that he still received more tax, despite Parliament's veto. Hence "Jack fell down and broke his crown" (many pint glasses in the UK still have a line marking the 1/2 pint level with a crown above it) "and Jill came tumbling after". The reference to "Jill", (actually a "gill", or 1/4 pint) is said to reflect that the gill dropped in volume as a consequence.<ref name=Jack2008/> The suggestion has also been made that Jack and Jill represent [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] of France, who was deposed and beheaded in 1793 (lost his crown), and his Queen, [[Marie Antoinette]] (who came tumbling after). A theory made difficult by the fact that the earliest printing of the rhyme pre-dates these events.<ref name=Jack2008>A. Jack, ''Pop Goes the Weasel: The Secret Meanings of Nursery Rhymes'' (London: Penguin, 2008), ISBN 0141909307.</ref> There is also a local belief that the rhyme records events in the village of [[Kilmersdon]] in [[Somerset]] in 1697. When a local [[spinster]] became pregnant, the putative father is said to have died from a rock fall and the woman died in childbirth soon after.<ref name=Jack2008/>
