The ''' Senegal Parrot ''' (''Poicephalus senegalus'') is a [[parrot]] which is a resident breeder in west [[Africa]].  It undergoes [[bird migration|local movements]], driven mainly by the availability of the fruit and blossoms which make up its diet. It is considered a farm pest, often feeding on crops.  

The Senegal Parrot is a bird of open woodland and savannah. It is a gregarious species, continuously chattering with a range of whistling and squawking calls.  Senegal Parrots live an average of approximately 25-30 years in the wild, but have been known to live for 50 years in captivity.

The Senegal Parrot is about 23 cm long and weighs about 125 to 170 gm.  They are stocky and have a relatively large head and beak.  Males are generally larger and heavier than female birds.  Adults have a charcoal grey head, yellow eyes, green back and throat, and yellow underparts and rump.  The yellow and green areas on a Senegal Parrot's front form a V-shape and resemble a yellow vest worn over green.  Immature birds are duller, with a lighter grey head and grey eyes.  Senegals are not [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], but there are some hypotheses on how to tell the genders apart; it is thought that a female's beak and head are smaller and narrower than the male's and also, the V-shape of the vest is usually longer in females, so that the green area extends down over the chest to between the legs whereas in males it ends midway down the chest.

==Nesting==
The Senegal Parrot nests in holes in trees, often [[Oil Palm]]s, usually laying 2-3 white eggs.  The eggs are about 3cm long x 2.5cm wide and are incubated for about 27 to 28 days.  Newly hatched chicks have a sparse white down and they do not open their eyes until about about 2 wks from hatching.  They are dependant on the hen for warmth who remains in the nest almost all of the time until about 4 wks from hatching when the chicks have enough feathers for heat insulation.  During this time the male brings food for the hen and for the chicks. 

==Subspecies==
There are three generally recognized subspecies.  They do not differ in behaviour, but only in the color of the "vest".  In the pet trade, the nominate subspecies is the most common though all three are raised and sold as pets.
* ''Poicephalus senegalus senegalus'' (the nominate subspecies):  The vest is yellow.  Its native range includes southern [[Mauritania]], southern [[Mali]] to [[Guinea]] and the [[Island of Los]].
* ''P. s. mesotypus'': This subspecies has an orange vest.  It comes from eastern and northeastern [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] into southwest [[Chad]].
* ''P. s. versteri'': The vest of this subspecies is red.  Its native range is the [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]] east to western [[Nigeria]].

==Pet parrots==
The Senegal Parrot has recently begun to be bred in captivity and is the most popular ''[[Poicephalus]]'' parrot in aviculture, with the [[Meyer's Parrot]] being the second most popular.  They can live up to 40 or 50 years in a safe clean home.  

Hand reared Senegal Parrots make excellent pets, and, like all ''Poicephalus'' parrots, they are curious, fun-loving animals that are much "mellower" compared with many other parrots.  They are acrobatic, amusing, and generally sweet.  They are able to speak in a limited fashion, often with a high squeaky voice, and can learn to mimic many sounds such as whistling, kisses, microwave beeps, and smoke alarms.  They do not make very loud noises, like some parrots do.  They are known for their jealousy of other family members and pets.  They can develop a bond with only one human and refuse to interact with other people, even attacking them in some cases.  Although a Senegal is a small bird it does not seem to believe so, and will attack larger birds and even dogs if it feels it or its human is threatened.  Owners should be cautious in multiple-pet homes.  Continuing to socialize the hand reared pet bird from a young age and letting many people handle and interact with it can prevent single-person bonding and allow it to become an excellent family pet.  

Wild-caught Senegal Parrots do not make good pets, because they do not become tame and they will always be frightened of humans.  The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species ([[CITES]]) has made the trade of wild caught parrots illegal.
