{{Chinese name|Tan ({{zh-cp|c=<U+9648>|p=Ch<U+00E9>n}})}}
'''Laurentia Tan Yen Yi''' ({{zh-cp|c=<U+9648><U+96C1><U+4EEA>|p=Ch<U+00E9>n Y<U+00E0>ny<U+00ED>}}<U+FF0C>{{pronounced|t<U+0283><U+0259>n i<U+025B>n i}}, {{respelled|ch<U+0259>n yen yee}}) (born 24 April 1979) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based [[Singapore]]an [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. At the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] she won Singapore's first two medals at the [[Paralympic Games]], both [[bronze medal]]s in [[dressage]]. Born with [[cerebral palsy]] and a profound [[hearing impairment]], Tan moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of three. She took up horse riding at five years as a form of [[physiotherapy]]. She subsequently completed her [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at the [[Mary Hare Grammar School]], a [[boarding school|residential]] [[special school]] for the deaf, and graduated with an honours degree from [[Oxford Brookes University]] in [[hospitality management]] and tourism.

In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at [[Hartpury College]] in [[Hartpury]], [[Gloucester]], in England in July that year. At this event, her first international competition, she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre at [[Sha Tin]], she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class IA). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games.

==Early years and education==
Laurentia Tan was born on 24 April 1979 in [[Singapore]].<ref name="Beijing 2008">{{citation|title=Athlete biography: TAN Laurentia|url=http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRMP/ENG/BIO/Athlete/1/1210261.shtml|publisher=[[2008 Summer Paralympics|Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games]], [[Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games|Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-09-13}}.</ref> She moved with her parents, Anslem, a business director, and Jannie, a local government officer, to [[London]] at the age of four years due to her father's work.<ref name="Today 20080912">{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Tan's bronze shine: Thanks to mum and dad's resolve, Singaporean is now a star athlete|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275491.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=12 September 2008|page=53}}.</ref><ref>According to an 11 September 2008 article in the ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'', the move to London occurred when she was three years old: {{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=Laurentia, the perfectionist: Paralympic medallist lip-reads, insists on eating with chopsticks|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=11 September 2008|page=A9}}.</ref> She now lives in [[New Malden]], [[Surrey]].<ref name="Beijing 2008"/> Tan has an older brother, Ephraim, who is an aerospace engineer.<ref name="ST 20080911">{{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=Laurentia, the perfectionist: Paralympic medallist lip-reads, insists on eating with chopsticks|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=11 September 2008|page=A9}}.</ref> Tan was born with [[cerebral palsy]] and profound [[hearing impairment]], and doctors informed her parents that she would probably not be able to walk. Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as her parents felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there.<ref name="ST 20080911"/> When she was in school she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her "Trouble". At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre Riding for the Disabled in London as a form of [[physiotherapy]].<ref name="Today 20080912"/> This activity helped her confidence and self-esteem, and eventually enabled her to walk and drive a car.<ref name="ST 20080910">{{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=First medal for S'pore: Tan claims equestrian bronze, also Asia's first, at the Paralympic Games|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Sport)|date=10 September 2008|page=B14}}.</ref> As a child, she also played cricket and football with her brother, and swam competitively.<ref name="ST 20080911"/>

Tan attended a mainstream school with a unit for the hearing-impaired, where she received [[speech and language pathology|speech therapy]]. She completed her [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at the [[Mary Hare Grammar School]], a [[boarding school|residential]] [[special school]] for the deaf,<ref name="ST 20080911"/> where she won an Elizabeth Dyson Prize and a prize for business studies.<ref>{{citation|title=Mary Hare history: Speech Day 1995|url=http://www.maryharehistory.org.uk/articles/speechday1995.html|publisher=[[Mary Hare Grammar School]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-09-13}}.</ref> From the age of 18, she stopped horse riding for eight years to pursue an honours degree in [[hospitality management]] and tourism at [[Oxford Brookes University]],<ref name="Today 20080912"/> and for a job as a mental health worker.<ref name="ST 20080911"/><ref name="ST 20080910"/> However, she missed the sport and took it up again in 2005.

==Sporting career==
In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) got in touch with Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships, which were a qualifier for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].<ref name="BT 20080913">{{citation|author=Siow Li Sen|title=Grooming disabled riders|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/whatsin/story/0,4574,296779,00.html?|newspaper=[[Business Times]] (Singapore)|date=13 September 2008}}.</ref> The event, Tan's first international competition, was held at [[Hartpury College]] in [[Hartpury]], [[Gloucester]], in England from 18 to 22 July 2007. She achieved 63% or higher in both her Team and Individual Tests, qualifying her to be selected for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]]. In the Freestyle to Music Test, she was placed fourth in a field of 18 riders with a best score of 67.94%.<ref>{{citation|title=Dressage rider Laurentia Tan qualifies for the 2008 Hong Kong Para Olympics &#91;sic&#93;!|url=http://www.rdasingapore.org/?p=15|publisher=Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore|date=22 August 2007|accessdate=2008-09-11}}.</ref>

===2008 Summer Paralympics===
In October 2007, Tan came to Singapore to train daily at RDA with volunteer coach Sally Drummond, who later went to the United Kingdom in April 2008 for two weeks to help her in her [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] ''d<U+00E9>but''.<ref name="BT 20080913"/> Tan also resigned her job in June 2008 to train full-time with her coach Penny Pegrum and overcome muscle [[spasticity]].<ref name="ST 20080910"/><ref name="Today 20080912"/> Her first event was the para-[[dressage]] Individual Championship Test (grade IA). Riders in this event are categorized into grades I to IV, those in grade I having the most severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] [[gelding]] loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as Harvey) at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre in [[Sha Tin]], Tan scored 68.80% to claim the [[bronze medal]] behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. She will also receive [[Singapore dollar|S$]]25,000 from the Singapore National Paralympic Council's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme.<ref name="ST 20080910"/><ref>{{citation|title=Roundup: British, German riders become biggest winners in Para-equestrian Freestyle|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/12/content_9935260.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 September 2008}}; {{citation|title=First Paralympian for Singapore emerges today <U+2013> Laurentia Tan|url=http://www.sdsc.org.sg/news_and_media/media_detail/595/|publisher=Singapore Disability Sports Council|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-13}}; {{citation|author=Low Lin Fhoong|title=Tan aims for No 2: One bronze in the bag, equestrian ace could taste more glory today|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275268.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=11 September 2008|page=49}}.

He felt that she should receive even more than them, given her cerebral palsy and profound deafness: see {{citation|author=Chua Sin Bin|title=She deserves even more|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275473.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=12 September 2008|page=38}}.</ref>

Following Tan's win, there was discussion about the coverage given by the Singapore press to Tan's feat. A correspondent to the ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'' criticized the fact that this newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had "focused almost primarily on her disability".<ref>{{citation|author=Liang Kaicheng|title=So proud, but why focus on disability?|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Forum)|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref> Another letter writer to ''[[my paper]]'' expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medal won by the Singapore women's table tennis team at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{citation|author=Yong Ming Han|title=Why so little attention paid to Paralympic bronze?|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Mailbox/Story/A1Story20080912-87350.html|newspaper=[[my paper]] (reproduced at AsiaOne)|date=12 September 2008|page=A28}}.</ref>

Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she and her horse performed to music.<ref name="ST 20080912">{{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=Bronze once again: Tan can't hear must but she and horse 'dance' their way to 2nd medal|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Sport)|date=12 September 2008|page=B21}}.</ref> The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as "beyond our expectations", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.<ref>{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Paralympics: Singapore's Laurentia Tan wins second Equestrian bronze|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/375273/1/.html|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref>
