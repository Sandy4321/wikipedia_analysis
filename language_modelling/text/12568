'''Beijing Jockey Club''' (BJC) locates in the TongZhou District of [[Beijing]], covering an area of 1.6 square kilometres. It was one of the biggest international standard [[horse-racing]] clubs in [[Asia]]. In 2001, with the approval of the state government, the club embarked on thorougbred racing as a major business. The club has bred over 2,000 [[thoroughbred]] horses.  However, the TongZhou (Tongshun) racecourse was shut down on 23 October 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mawww.com/defaulten.asp |title=Archived page|publisher=Beijing Jockey Club|accessdate=2009-06-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050313104719/http://www.mawww.com/defaulten.asp |archivedate = 2005-03-13}}</ref>  In the following month, over 600 horses were destroyed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2005/nov/22/horseracing.gdnsport3|title=Huge cull of racehorses at Beijing track|last=Godfrey|first=Nicholas|date=Tuesday 22 November 2005 |work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref> The reason for the closure and the cull appears to have been loss of revenue, following the decision of the Chinese government not to allow gambling on horseracing.  The club had previously operated a Tote system in 2003, apparently supported by the local government, but this had to be suspended in the 2004/5 season, following the government decision.  The club now appears to be shut down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://shanghaiist.com/2005/11/23/a_china_horsera.php|title=A China horse-racing punt goes to pot|last=Jamieson|first=Marina|date= November 23, 2005|work=Shanghaiist|publisher=Gothamist LLC|accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>
