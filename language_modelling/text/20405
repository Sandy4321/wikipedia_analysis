[[Image:Porrina de Badajoz.jpg|thumb|280px|Andalusian cadences are common in Flamenco music.]]
The '''Andalusian cadence''' is a term adopted from [[flamenco]] music for a [[chord progression]] comprising four [[Chord (music)|chords]] descending stepwise.<ref name="flamenco">[http://www.mojacarflamenco.com/FB_For_Guitarists.html Moj<U+00E1>car Flamenco], a website about basics in Flamenco music</ref> It is otherwise known as the minor [[descending tetrachord]]. Traceable back to the [[Renaissance]], its effective sonorities made it one of the most popular progressions in [[classical music]].

Despite the name it is not a true [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] (i.e., occurring only once, when ending a phrase, section, or piece of music<ref name="buciu">Buciu, Dan (1989). ''Tonal Harmony'', "Ciprian Porumbescu" Conservatory Publishing House, Bucharest</ref>) but is most often used as an [[ostinato]] (repeating over and over again). It is heard in many [[Rock music|rock]] songs (e.g. "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" by [[Pink Floyd]] or "[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]" by [[Del Shannon]]), but also in [[Classical music]], as in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Chaconne]] from the [[Solo violin partita No. 2 (Bach)|Partita in D minor for solo violin]], [[BWV]] 1004.

==Structure==
:''For further explanation see [[Chord progression]]''
The upper [[tetrachord]] of minor scales varies: in C minor, the sixth may be '''A<math>\flat</math>''' or '''A''' while the seventh may be '''B<math>\flat</math>''' or '''B''').<ref name="popp">Popp, Marius (1998). ''Applicatory Harmony in Jazz, Pop & Rock Improvisation'', Nemira Publishing House, Bucharest. ISBN 973-569-228-7</ref> To avoid confusion the chords of the progression may have accidentals added. The Andalusian cadence may then be notated '''i - <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI - V'''  rather than simply '''i - VII - VI - V'''. The '''<math>\flat</math>VII''' note and chord is called the [[subtonic]].<ref name="buciu"/> In the final chord '''V''' the [[Leading-tone|leading note]] replaces the subtonic.

==Origins==
[[Image:Andalusian.png|thumb|right|500px|A typical Andalusian cadence ''por arriba'' (i.e. in A minor). G is the subtonic and G# is the leading tone. {{Audio|Figure_andalusian.ogg|(Listen)}}]]
A popular melodic pattern of [[Ancient Greece]]<ref name="danceanu">D<U+01CE>nceanu, Liviu (2005). ''Seasons in Music'', vol. 1, Corgal Press, Bac<U+01CE>u. ISBN 973-7922-37-9</ref> offers a possible starting point for the Andalusian cadence. Called the ''Dorian [[tetrachord]]'', the sequence resembles the bass line of the chord progression developed centuries later. Some theorists consider that the same structure may have occurred earlier in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].<ref name="danceanu"/><ref name="gruber">Gruber, R.I. (1960). ''History of Universal Music'', State Musical Publishing House, Moscow</ref> A sequence more or less close to the Greek tetrachord structure might have been known to the [[Moors]] in Southern [[Spain]] and spread from there through Western Europe. The [[France|French]] [[troubadour]]s were influenced by the [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]].<ref name="danceanu"/> 

The Andalusian cadence known today, using [[Triad (music)|triad chords]], may be no earlier than the Renaissance, though the use of parallel thirds or sixths occurred from the 13th century.<ref name="margo">Schulter, Margo (1997). ''Thirteenth-Century Polyphony'', published on the [http://www.medieval.org medieval.org] site</ref> Some sources state that the chord sequence was noted for the first time by [[Claudio Monteverdi]] in a [[Vocal music|choral]] work, [http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Amor_(Lamento_della_Ninfa)_(Claudio_Monteverdi) ''Lamento della Ninfa''], first published in the Eighth Book of [[madrigal (music)|Madrigal]]s (1638) <U+2013> other works in the same collection are known to have been played as soon as 1607.

The progression resembles the first four measures of the 15th century [[Passamezzo antico]]; '''i - <math>\flat</math>VII - i - V'''. The use of the '''<math>\flat</math>VI''' chord may suggest a more recent origin than the Passamezzo antico since the cadences '''i - <math>\flat</math>VII''' and '''<math>\flat</math>VII - i''' were popular in the late [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]],<ref name="margo"/> ''(see also [[double tonic]])'' while '''<math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI''' arose as a result of advancement in music theory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} However, the absence of the leading tone from the '''<math>\flat</math>VII''' chord suggests that the progression originated before the tonal system in the [[Musical mode|modal]] approach of the time of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], where the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] must be approached from chord '''V'''<ref name="rotaru">Rotaru, Doina and Comes, Liviu (1987). ''Vocal and Instrumental Counterpoint Treatise'', Musical Publishing School, Bucharest</ref>
whereas typical [[Baroque]] style would have avoided the flat '''VII''' and introduced [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] chords ('''<math>\natural</math>VII''' or '''V''' chords,<ref name="buciu"/> to form cadences [[Resolution (music)|resolving]] upon a '''i''' chord).

==Analysis==
====Regarding the melody====
A [[minor seventh]] would be added to the dominant "V" chord to increase [[Tension (music)|tension]] before resolution (V<sub>7</sub>-i).<ref name="buciu"/> The roots of the chords belong to a modern [[Phrygian mode|phrygian]] tetrachord (the equivalent of a Greek Dorian tetrachord,<ref name="oprea">Oprea, Gheorghe (2002). ''Musical Folklore in Romania'', Musical Publishing House, Bucharest. ISBN 973-42-0304-5</ref> the latter mentioned above), that is to be found as the upper tetrachord of a natural minor scale (for A minor, they are: A G F E).

A remarkable fact about tetrachords was noticed since the [[Classical antiquity|Ancient times]] and rediscovered in early Renaissance: when a tetrachord features a [[semitone]] (half-step) between two of its tones, it is the semitone that will determine the melodic tendency of the given tetrachord or mode (when combining tetrachords).<ref name="dragos">Alexandrescu, Drago<U+015F> (1997). ''Music theory'', vol. 2, Kitty Publishing House, Bucharest</ref> If the semitone falls between the highest two steps, the melody tends to be ascending (e.g. major scales); a semitone between the lowest tones in the tetrachord involves a melody "inclined" to descend. This said, the Phrygian tetrachord, borrowed from traditional music of Eastern Europe and [[Anatolia]],<ref name="dragos"/> is to be found also in the Andalusian cadence and sets the mentioned character (the semitone falls between [the roots of] V and <math>\flat</math>VI).

====Modal vs. tonal====
A rigorous analysis should take into account the fact that many chord progressions are likely to date back from an epoch prior to early Baroque (usually associated with birth of tonality).<ref name="dragos"/> In such cases (also, that of the Andalusian cadence), explanations offered by tonality "neglect" the history and evolution of the chord progression in question. This is because harmonic analyses in tonal style use only two scales (major and minor) when explaining origins of chord moves. In exchange, the luxuriant ''modal system'' (i.e., the entirety of musical modes ever created and their specific harmonies <U+2013> if existing<ref name="dragos"/>) offers various plausible origins and explanations for every chord move. However, most classical (Baroque or subsequent) and popular music which makes use of the given chord progression might treat it itself in a tonal manner.<ref name="buciu"/>

A number of musicians and theorists (of which, renowned guitarist [[Manolo Sanl<U+00FA>car]]) consider the Andalusian cadence as a chord progression built upon the Phrygian mode.<ref name="manolo">Norberto Torres Cort<U+00E9>s (2001). ''El compromiso y la generosidad de Manolo Sanl<U+00FA>car'', published in the ''El Olivo'' revue, N<u><sup>o</sup></u> 88; also available [http://www.tristeyazul.com/cronicas/ntc14.htm here]</ref> Since tonality took the first chord in the progression for a tonic ("i"), the Phrygian notation (modal) of the cadence writes as following: iv - <math>\flat</math>III - <math>\flat</math>II - I (or, more commonly, but less correctly, iv - III - II - I<ref name="flamenco"/>). Though [[Diatonic function|tonal functions]] have little in common with the Phrygian mode, the four chords could be roughly equalized. (The Phrygian mode is like a natural minor with step two lowered;<ref name="popp"/> however, step three switches between major and minor third, an equivalent to the subtonic/leading tone conflict in the tonal acceptation.) Thus, the "iv" corresponds to a subdominant chord, while "<math>\flat</math>III" is the [[mediant]] and "I" is the tonic. The "<math>\flat</math>II" chord has a dominant function,<ref name="manolo"/> and may be thought of as a [[tritone substitution]] of "V", i.e., the [[Neapolitan chord|Neapolitan sixth chord]].<ref name="popp"/> (The only purpose for highlighting these "functions" is to compare between the modal and tonal views of the cadence. The mode involved in the cadence is not a pure Phrygian, but one whose third step occurs in both instances, minor and major third. This is unacceptable in tonality;<ref name="oprea"/> hence, tonal functions cannot be used. A common mistake occurs when the given mode is thought of as major, given that the tonic chord is major.<ref name="flamenco"/> However, the Phrygian mode features a minor third and the "I" chord may be taken for a [[borrowed chord]], i.e., a [[Picardy third]].)

====Harmonic peculiarities====
The tonal system sets three main functions for the [[Diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] tertian chords: tonic (T), dominant (D) and [[subdominant]] (SD). Any sequence through different functions is allowed (e.g. T<U+2192>D, SD<U+2192>D), except for D<U+2192>SD.<ref name="diana">Voda-Nuteanu, Diana (2006, 2007). ''Harmony'', Musical Publishing House, Bucharest. ISBN (10) 973-42-0438-6, (13) 978-973-42-0438-0</ref>  A tonal scale's degrees are as following: "I" and "VI" are tonic chords (of which, "I" is stronger; all final cadences end in "I"), "V" and "VII" are dominants (both feature the leading tone and "V" is more potent), "IV" and "II" are subtonic chords ("IV" is stronger).<ref name="buciu"/> ("III" isn't given a precise function, although it may replace a dominant in some cases.) All sequences between same-function chords, from the weaker member to the stronger (e.g. VII - V), are forbidden. When using the natural minor, dominant chords exchange their leading tone for a subtonic; as a result, their dominant quality is strongly undermined.<ref name="buciu"/>

A tonal insight on the Andalusian cadence leads to considering the "<math>\flat</math>VII" a local exception: the subtonic it uses for a root should be, however, re-replaced by the leading tone before returning to "i". (The leading tone is heard in the "V" chord, as the chord's [[major third]].) A "<math>\flat</math>VII" would leave the dominant category (compare: "<math>\natural</math>VII") and start acting to the contrary.<ref name="buciu"/> That is, a "<math>\flat</math>VII" chord would now prefer moving to a subdominant rather than to a tonic chord. Yet, the Andalusian cadence brings about a limit condition for tonal [[harmony]], with a <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI chord move.<ref name="diana"/>

The Andalusian is an authentic cadence, because a dominant chord ("V") comes just before the tonic "i". (Using modal harmonies, the third, and not the fourth chord <U+2013> "<math>\flat</math>II" <U+2013> acts as the dominant, substituted to tritone. Even so, the cadence stays authentic. The fourth chord itself is the tonic, so the cadence need not return to the tonal tonic, i.e. modal "iv".)<ref name="buciu"/>

==Denominations in Flamenco music==
====Basic keys====
The [[standard tuning]] in [[guitar]]s determines most Flamenco music to be played only in a few keys. Of those, the most popular are the A minor and D minor (equivalent to E and A Phrygian, respectively)<ref name="flamenco"/>. They are as following: 
* ''por arriba'', which corresponds to the A minor, where an Andalusian cadence consists of the following chord progression: Am - G - F - E
* ''por medio'' names the D minor key, in which the Andalusian cadence is built of a Dm - C - B<math>\flat</math> - A progression<ref name="flamenco"/>

====Derivative keys====
Using a [[capo]]tasto or [[Scordatura|scordature]]<!--plural of "scordatura"-->, other keys can be obtained, mainly derived from the two basic keys. Flamenco guitarists [[Ramon Montoya]] and [[Antonio Chac<U+00F3>n]] were among the first to use the new keys, and given distinctive names:<ref name="manolo"/>

====Popular music====
{{Main|List of popular music songs featuring Andalusian cadences}}
Andalusian cadences were heavily used in all [[popular music]] [[Musical genre|genres]] during the [[1960s|sixties]] and slightly into the [[1970s|seventies]]. [[British rock]] bands [[The Kinks]] and [[Deep Purple]] were especially fond of it, while during the 70s Pink Floyd would allude to the progression in numerous songs, however not stating it in its pure form (see [[#Examples where the progression is somewhat altered|below]]). Songs of the early 1960s, such as [[the Ventures]]' 1960 hit "[[Walk, Don't Run (song)|Walk, Don't Run]]", turned the Andalusian cadence iconic for [[surf rock]] music.

In the late seventies and [[1980s|eighties]] only a few [[hit single]]s made use of Andalusian cadences (probably the best known example is "[[Sultans of Swing]]" by English band [[Dire Straits]]). However, the 1990s brought about a revival of the progression, mainly with the growing interest in Flamenco and [[Latin American music|Latin music]] (recent examples include 2002 [[Pop music|pop]] hit "[[The Ketchup Song|Aserej<U+00E9>]]" [[List of acronyms and initialisms: A#AK|a.k.a.]] "The Ketchup Song" by [[Spanish music|Spanish]] band [[Las Ketchup]]). On the contrary, a number of [[indie rock]] artists of the nineties (such as [[The Olivia Tremor Control]]) used Andalusian cadences to recreate the 1960s music mood.

==Examples where the progression is somewhat altered==
{{listen
  | filename = Invocatie_andalusian.ogg
  | title = "Invoca<U+0163>ie (Phoenix)"
  | description = This audio sample features a song section which brings forward a progression very close to the Andalusian cadence. Starting from a three-note [[Motif (music)|motif]] played on [[tubular bell]]s, the cadence is built gradually, involving acoustic and bass guitars, a reciter, drums, [[electric guitar]], [[synthesizer]]s and harmony vocals.}}

The following is a categorized list of musical examples wherein a chord progression quite similar to the Andalusian cadence occurs; while the items in the top of the list stay as close to a typical cadence, the examples which follow contain progressions where an Andalusian cadence is all the more difficult to recognise (roughly, sorted gradually).

====Reordered or repeated chords====
* "[[California Dreamin']]" (1965) by [[The Mamas & the Papas]], where two chords have changed places: i (- i<sub>2</sub>) - '''<math>\flat</math>VI''' - '''<math>\flat</math>VII''' - V<math>{}^5_{4-3}</math>. (Note: the "i<sub>2</sub>" notation represents a tonic chord whose seventh falls in the bass; a "<math>{}^5_{4-3}</math>" notation suggests a [[suspended chord]] resolving to triad<ref name="diana"/>)
* "[[Don't Speak]]" (1995) by [[No Doubt]] and "[[Big in Japan (song)|Big in Japan]]" (1984) by [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] follow a very similar pattern: i - '''<math>\flat</math>VI''' - '''<math>\flat</math>VII''' - V
* "Invoca<U+0163>ie" ([[English language|engl]]. "Conjuration," 1975) by [[Transsylvania Phoenix|Phoenix]] features an extensive section which combines a i - ii<sup>o</sup><sub>2</sub> - i progression (the tonic is constantly heard on acoustic guitar as a [[pedal point|pedal]]) with a cadence very similar to the Andalusian: i - <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI - <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI - V<math>{}^5_{4-3}</math>. Repeating the chord move "<math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI" and the suspended dominant chord increase tension before resolution in "i".

====Foreign chords, bassline unchanged====
* The song "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]" (1973) by Pink Floyd also makes use of a very similar progression. However, the tonic "I" is rather a major chord, and the "<math>\flat</math>VII" chord is replaced by a "I<sub>2</sub>", which essentially keeps the bassline as is (the minor seventh in "I<sub>7</sub>" coincides with the root of "<math>\flat</math>VII", as the former is played in the bass).
* The song "[[Lonely Sea]]" (1963) by [[The Beach Boys]] features a progression reminiscent of the Andalusian cadence, but in which all four chords are major (the last three are left unchanged, while the first chord turns from minor to major). The resulting progression sounds rather modal (the first chord move will be heard as a V-IV in a [[ionian mode]], since no chord was played before them <U+2013> as with the <math>\flat</math>VII-<math>\flat</math>VI in the Andalusian cadence).

====Extended progressions====
* "A Saucerful of Secrets" (1968) by Pink Floyd features an ostinato extended progression based on the four chords. All chords are diatonic; the progression incorporates the fourth step (subdominant), both minor and major. A major "IV" chord indicates use of the "melodic variant" of a minor scale (i.e., natural minor with steps six and seven raised <U+2013> just like a major scale with step three flatted). The whole progression is as follows: i - <math>\flat</math>VII - IV - V - <math>\flat</math>III - <math>\flat</math>VI - IV - <math>\flat</math>VII - V - i - <math>\flat</math>VI - V - iv - <math>\flat</math>III - V.

====Dominant chord missing====
* "Sugar" (1999) by [[April March]] makes use of a i - <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI - '''<math>\flat</math>II''' progression, in which the dominant chord "V" is replaced by a [[Neapolitan sixth]] ("<math>\flat</math>II") via [[tritone substitution]].
* "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" (1968) by Pink Floyd, where the "v" chord is given a minor quality (subtonic) and so the song changes to a "modal" sound. Below all chords, a pedal consisting of the tonic chord's root is played.
* A most unusual way of altering the cadence can be heard in Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" (1979), where the "V" chord is skipped for a "iv". It is as follows: i - <math>\flat</math>VII - <math>\flat</math>VI (- <math>\flat</math>VI<sub>2</sub>) - iv (and back to "i"). The resulting progression is on the edge between tonal and modal, where the subtonic doesn't change back into a leading-tone, but the obtained cadence is suitable for tonality (called plagal or [[backdoor progression|backdoor]]<ref name="diana"/>).

==Lydian cadence==
{{listen
  | filename = Minnie_lydian.ogg
  | title = "Lovin' You (Minnie Riperton)"
  | description = "Lovin' You" (1974) by [[Minnie Riperton]] is one of the best known examples for Lydian cadences. This audio fragment features the [[Introduction (music)|intro]] and the first [[Verse-chorus form|verse]]; in other words, the cadence is played four times in a row, using the key of [[E major]].}}
Although not a very popular notion, some jazz theorists introduced the ''lydian cadence'', which is formally close to an Andalusian cadence, but very distinct as sound. While an Andalusian cadence is built upon steps "I", "VII", "VI" and "V" of a minor scale (at this point, mentioning the major/minor quality of chords and whether the "VII" and "VI" are flatted or natural have a lesser importance), a Lydian cadence uses the same steps as well (I - VII - VI - V), but in a (modern) [[Lydian mode#Mediaeval and modern Lydian mode|Lydian mode]]. (The Lydian mode is like a major scale whose fourth step is raised.<ref name="dragos"/>) Following the tonal system convention, the Lydian cadence should be written referring to a major scale.

Hence, a Lydian cadence contains the following chords: IV - <math>\natural</math>iii - ii - I. The tetrachord formed between the chords' roots has now an ascending melodic tendency (a semitone falls between the highest two steps, i.e. "IV" and "iii"). Yet, the chord progression opposes, whereas the chords' roots descend (therefore, a progression of I - ii - <math>\natural</math>iii - IV would've been much more "natural".) However, the song "[[Boys Don't Cry (song)|Boys Don't Cry]]" (1979) by [[The Cure]] features the run in both directions: I - ii - iii - IV - iii - ii - I. Lydian cadences are plagal - the "ii" chord occurring before the tonic "I" is a subdominant (as well as the "IV".)<ref name="buciu"/>
