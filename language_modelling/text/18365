'''Thornton Niven Wilder''' (April 17, 1897 <U+2013> December 7, 1975) was an American playwright and novelist. He won three [[Pulitzer Prizes]]<U+2014>for the novel ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]''<ref name=pulitzernovel/> and for the two plays ''[[Our Town]]'' and ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''<ref name=pulitzerdrama/><U+2014>and a U.S. [[National Book Award]] for the novel ''The Eighth Day''.<ref name=nba1968/>

==Early years==
[[File:Thornton Wilder as a child at family vacation cabin Wisconsin 1900.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Thornton Wilder as a child, pictured with his two sisters and his father Amos at family cottage in [[Maple Bluff, Wisconsin]], 1900]]
Wilder was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], the son of Amos Parker Wilder, a newspaper editor<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|last=Isherwood|first=Charles|title=A Life Captured With Luster Left Intact|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/books/thornton-wilder-a-life-by-penelope-niven.html?emc=tnt&tntemail1=y|accessdate=November 1, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 31, 2012|pages=C1}}</ref> and U.S. diplomat, and Isabella Niven Wilder.  All of the Wilder children spent part of their childhood in China. His older brother, [[Amos Wilder|Amos Niven Wilder]], was Hollis Professor of Divinity at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], a noted poet, and foundational to the development of the field of [[theopoetics]]. Amos was also a nationally ranked tennis player who competed at the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis championships]] in 1922. His sister, Isabel, was an accomplished writer. Both of his other sisters, [[Charlotte Wilder]], a poet, and [[Janet Wilder Dakin]], a zoologist, attended [[Mount Holyoke College]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Education==
[[File:Thornton Wilder Yale graduation photo 1920.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Wilder in his [[Yale College]] graduation [[photograph|photo]], 1920]]
Wilder began writing plays while at [[The Thacher School]] in [[Ojai, California]], where he did not fit in and was teased by classmates as overly [[intellectual]]. According to a classmate, "We left him alone, just left him alone. And he would retire at the library, his hideaway, learning to distance himself from humiliation and indifference."  His family lived for a time in China, where his sister Janet was born in 1910. He attended the English [[China Inland Mission]] [[Chefoo School]] at [[Yantai]] but returned with his mother and siblings to California in 1912 because of the unstable political conditions in China at the time. Thornton also attended Creekside Middle School in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and graduated from [[Berkeley High School (California)|Berkeley High School]] in 1915.

After having served a three-month enlistment in the Army's [[Coast Artillery Corps]] at [[Fort Adams]], Rhode Island, in [[World War I]] (rising to the rank of [[corporal]]), he attended [[Oberlin College]] before earning his Bachelor of Arts degree at [[Yale University]] in 1920, where he refined his writing skills as a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, a literary society. He earned his [[Master of Arts]] degree in French from [[Princeton University]] in 1926.

==Career==
After graduating, Wilder studied in Rome, Italy, and then taught French at the [[Lawrenceville School]] in [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey]].  In 1926 Wilder's first novel, ''The Cabala'', was published.  In 1927, ''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' brought him commercial success and his first [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1928. He resigned from the Lawrenceville School in 1928. From 1930 to 1937 he taught at the [[University of Chicago]], during which time he published his translation of Andr<U+00E9> Obey's own adaptation of the tale, "Le Viol de Lucrece" (1931) under the title "Lucrece" (Longmans Green, 1933).<ref>http://www.theatermania.com/new-york-city-theater/reviews/05-2000/lucrece_714.html</ref> In 1938 he won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for his play ''[[Our Town]]'', and he won the prize again in 1942 for his play ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''.

[[World War II]] saw him rise to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Force]] Intelligence, first in Africa, then in Italy until 1945. He received several awards. He went on to be a visiting professor at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where he served for a year as the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton professor]]. Though he considered himself a teacher first and a writer second, he continued to write all his life, receiving the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]] in 1957 and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963. In 1968 he won the National Book Award for his novel ''The Eighth Day''.<ref name=nba1968/>

Wilder translated plays by [[Andr<U+00E9> Obey]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and wrote the [[libretti]] to two operas, ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner (opera)|The Long Christmas Dinner]]'', composed by [[Paul Hindemith]], and ''The Alcestiad'', composed by [[Louise Talma]] and based on his own play.  Also, [[Alfred Hitchcock]], whom he admired, asked him to write the screenplay to his thriller, ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.<ref>Kornhaber, Donna. [http://mcfarland.metapress.com/content/w48p65k7312810j4/ Hitchcock's Diegetic Imagination: Thornton Wilder, ''Shadow of a Doubt'', and Hitchcock's Mise-en-Scene]" ''Clues: A Journal of Detection'' 31.1 (2013): 67-78. doi:10.3172/CLU.31.1.67</ref>

''[[The Bridge of San Luis Rey]]'' (1927) tells the story of several unrelated people who happen to be on a bridge in [[Peru]] when it collapses, killing them. Philosophically, the book explores the problem of evil, or the question of why unfortunate events occur to people who seem "innocent" or "undeserving". It won the Pulitzer Prize<ref name=NYT/> in 1928, and in 1998 it was selected by the editorial board of the American Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of the twentieth century.  The book was quoted by [[British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] during the memorial service for victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Text of Tony Blair's reading in New York| place = UK | pages = | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = September 21, 2001 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/sep/21/september11.usa11 | accessdate = 2009-06-03}}</ref> Since then its popularity has grown enormously. The book is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and [[disaster film|film-making]], where a single disaster intertwines the victims, whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks to events before the disaster.

Wilder was the author of ''[[Our Town]]'', a popular play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, [[New Hampshire]].  It was inspired by his friend [[Gertrude Stein]]'s novel ''The Making of Americans'', and many elements of Stein's [[modernist]] style can be found throughout the work. Wilder suffered from severe [[writer's block]] while writing the final act. ''Our Town'' employs a choric narrator called the "[[Stage manager|Stage Manager]]" and a [[minimalism|minimalist]] set to underscore the human experience.  Wilder himself played the Stage Manager on Broadway for two weeks and later in [[summer stock]] productions.  Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, Wilder illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.

[[File:Thornton Wilder (1948).jpg|thumb|left|Wilder as Mr. Antrobus in ''The Skin of Our Teeth'', 1948]]
In 1938, [[Max Reinhardt]] directed a Broadway production of ''[[The Merchant of Yonkers]]'', which Wilder had adapted from [[Austria]]n playwright [[Johann Nestroy]]'s ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (1842).  It was a failure, closing after just 39 performances.

His play ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'' opened in New York on November 18, 1942, with [[Fredric March]] and [[Tallulah Bankhead]] in the leading roles. Again, the themes are familiar <U+2013> the timeless human condition; history as progressive, cyclical, or entropic; literature, philosophy, and religion as the touchstones of civilization.  Three acts dramatize the travails of the Antrobus family, allegorizing the [[alternate history]] of mankind.  It was claimed by Joseph Campbell and Robert Morton Robinson, authors of ''A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake'', that much of the play was the result of unacknowledged borrowing from [[James Joyce]]'s last work.<ref>[[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Henry Morton Robinson]] published a pair of reviews-cum-denunciations entitled "The Skin of ''Whose'' Teeth?" in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' immediately after the play's debut; these created a huge uproar at the time. <br/><U+2022> Joseph Campbell, ''Mythic Worlds, Modern Words'', [[New World Library]], 2004, pp. 257<U+2013>66 reprints the reviews and discusses the controversy.</ref><ref>Joseph Campbell, ''Pathways to Bliss'', [[New World Library]], 2005, pp. 121<U+2013>3.</ref>

In his novel, ''[[The Ides of March (novel)|The Ides of March]]'' (1948), dedicated to an anti-fascist Italian writer, [[Lauro De Bosis]], Wilder reflected on parallels between [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]. He had met [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] on a U.S. lecture tour after the war, and was under the influence of [[existentialism]], rejecting its [[atheist]] implications.<ref>Malcolm Goldstein. ''The Art of Thornton Wilder''. Lincoln: [[University of Nebraska Press]], 1965. pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref>

In 1955, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] encouraged Wilder to rework ''The Merchant of Yonkers'' into ''[[The Matchmaker]]''.  This time the play enjoyed a healthy Broadway run of 486 performances with [[Ruth Gordon]] in the title role, winning a [[Tony Award]] for Guthrie, its director. It later became the basis for the hit 1964 musical ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', with a book by [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]] and score by [[Jerry Herman]].

In 1962 and 1963, Wilder lived twenty months in the small town of [[Douglas, Arizona]], apart from family and friends. There he started his longest novel, ''The Eighth Day'', which went on to win the National Book Award. According to Harold Augenbraum in 2009, it "attack[ed] the big questions head on, ... [embedded] in the story of small-town America".<ref name=augenbraum>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbafictionblog.org/nba-winning-books-blog/1968.html |author=Harold Augenbraum and Staff |title=1968 |date=July 23, 2009 |work=60 Years of the National Book Awards <U+2013> 79 Fiction Winners ([http://www.nationalbook.org/nba77fictionwinners.html#.T3N9SuyIl4I anniversary blog]) |publisher=[[National Book Foundation]] |accessdate=2012-03-28 }}</ref>

His last novel, ''[[Theophilus North]]'', was published in 1973, and made into the film ''[[Mr. North]]'' in 1988.

The Library of America republished the first five novels, six early stories, and four essays on fiction in one volume in 2009.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.loa.org/volume.jsp?RequestID=306 | first= Thornton | last=Wilder | title=The Bridge of San Luis Rey and Other Novels 1926<U+2013>1948 | isbn= 978-1-59853-045-2}}</ref>  Later novels are to be in a forthcoming volume.

==Personal life==
Although Wilder never discussed being homosexual publicly or in his writings, his close friend [[Samuel Steward]] is considered by some to have been a lover. Wilder was introduced to Steward by [[Gertrude Stein]], who at the time regularly corresponded with both of them. The third act of ''Our Town'' was allegedly drafted after a long walk, during a brief affair with Steward in [[Zurich]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite book | last = Steward | first = Samuel | coauthors = Stein, Gertrude; Toklas, Alice B. | title = Dear Sammy: Letters from Gertrude Stein & Alice B. Toklas | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 1977 | isbn = 0395253403 | page = 32}}</ref>

In Penelope Niven's biography, "[[Thornton Wilder: A Life]]", she provides considerable correspondence evidence that the third act of "Our Town" was not written in response to any walk, conversation, or affair with [[Samuel Steward]] but was written months afterward.  Niven also raises doubts about Steward's uncorroborated and unsubstantiated claims of having been Wilder's lover.<ref>{{cite book | last = Niven | first = Penelope | title = Thornton Wilder: A Life | publisher = [[HarperCollins]] | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0060831363}}</ref>

Wilder had a wide circle of friends and enjoyed mingling with other famous people,<ref name=NYT/> including [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Russel Wright]], [[Willa Cather]], and [[Montgomery Clift]].

==Death==
Wilder died on December 7, 1975, age 78, in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], where he lived for many years with his sister Isabel. He was interred at Hamden's Mount Carmel Cemetery.
