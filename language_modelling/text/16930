He started with baseball then added basketball and football as he got older.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Due to a lack of organized school teams, he arranged to have football games between neighborhoods and contacted kids from other schools to participate.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  During the weekends, he would spend time outdoors alone hunting [[rabbits]].<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  In his late teens and college years, he played organized [[Town Team Baseball|baseball]] in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

He chose to continue his basketball career and play for the Lakers because they were local and because he was offered a raise to stay for the season.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Grant's friend, [[Sid Hartman]], was the Laker's [[general manager]], which may have influenced his decision to remain with the team.<ref name="Manly" />  He averaged 2.6 points per game in his two seasons as a reserve with the Lakers and was a member of the 1950 championship team.<ref name="BRLakers">{{cite web|title=1950 Minneapolis Lakers|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MNL/1950.html|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

===Professional football===
After two seasons in the NBA, Grant decided to end his professional basketball career.<ref name="VikingUpdate" /> He contacted the Philadelphia Eagles of the NFL<ref name="VikingUpdate" /> and agreed to play for the team during the [[1951 NFL season]].<ref name="Manly" />  In his first season with the Eagles, Grant played as a [[defensive end]] and led the team in [[Quarterback sack|sacks]] (an unofficial statistic at the time).<ref name="VikingUpdate" /><ref name="Manly" />  He switched to offense as a [[wide receiver]] for his second season with the club and ranked second in the NFL for receiving yardage, with 997 yards on fifty-six catches, including seven touchdowns.<ref name="Manly" /><ref name="PFR">{{cite web|title=Bud Grant|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/GranBu00.htm|publisher=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

Grant's contact expired at the end of the [[1952 NFL season]] and the Eagles refused to pay him what he thought he was worth.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  The Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the CFL had been interested in Grant while in college.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Grant left for [[Winnipeg, Canada]] in 1953 and became the first professional player to "play out his option" and leave for another team.<ref name="VikingUpdate" /><ref name="Manly" />  He played for the Blue Bombers until 1956 as an [[end (football)|offensive end]] and was named a [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Conference]] all-star three times.<ref name="PFRA" /><ref name="Manitoba">{{cite web|title=Bud Grant|url=http://www.halloffame.mb.ca/honoured/1984/bGrant.htm|publisher=The Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame & Museum|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>  He led the Western Conference in pass receptions for the [[1953 in Canadian football|1953]], [[1954 in Canadian football|1954]], and [[1956 in Canadian football|1956]] seasons and receiving yards for the 1953 and 1956 seasons.<ref name="PFRA" />  He also holds the distinction of having five interceptions in a playoff game, played on [[October 28]], [[1953]], which is a CFL record.<ref name="CFL">{{cite web|title=All-Time Playoff Records|url=http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=171|publisher=CFL.ca|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref><ref name="CFHOF">{{cite web|title=Harry (Bud) Grant|url=http://www.footballhof.com/famers/player.asp?id=92|publisher=Canadian Football Hall of Fame & Museum|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>  The Blue Bombers played for the [[Grey Cup]] in 1953, but lost to the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] in the [[41st Grey Cup|41st Grey Cup game]].<ref name="PFRA" />

==Coaching career==
===Winnipeg Blue Bombers===
Blue Bombers management decided that they needed a new coach prior to the [[1957 in Canadian football|1957 season]].<ref name="Manly" />  On [[January 30]], [[1956]], Grant accepted the Blue Bombers head coaching position after impressing management with his ability to make adjustments on offense and defense as a player.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Club president, J.T. Russell, thought that Grant could coach even though nobody else did.<ref name="Manitoba" />  Grant would remain the head coach of the Blue Bombers until 1966.  During his ten seasons as head coach in Winnipeg, he led the team to six [[Grey Cup]] appearances, winning the championship four times in [[1958 CFL season|1958]], [[1959 CFL season|1959]], [[1961 CFL season|1961]], and [[1962 CFL season|1962]].<ref name="CFLStats">{{cite web|title=HARRY PETER BUD GRANT|url=http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=halloffame&func=display&hid=72&letter=g|publisher=CFL.ca|accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>  He finished his Blue Bombers coaching career with a regular season record of 105 wins, 53 loses, and two ties and an overall record of 122 wins, 66 loses, and 3 ties.<ref name="Manitoba" />  Grant was the [[CFL Coach of the Year]] in 1965.<ref name="CFLStats" /> Grant took on additional responsibilities as a club manager between 1964 and 1966.<ref name="Manitoba" />  [[Max Winter]], the Minnesota Vikings founder, contacted Grant in 1961 and asked him to coach the new NFL expansion team.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Grant declined the offer and remained in Winnipeg until 1967 when Winter and General Manager [[Jim Finks]] were able to successfully lure Grant to Minnesota on a second attempt.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />

===Minnesota Vikings===
Grant continued his coaching success in the NFL as he took over from original coach, [[Norm Van Brocklin]].<ref name="Manly" />  Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would follow the coach's lead if he were to panic or lose his poise during the course of a game.<ref name="AFM" />  He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire [[Star Spangled Banner|national anthem]] played before the game and even had national anthem practice.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather<ref name="Manly" /> and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />

In his second year, Grant led the team to a divisional championship and his first [[NFL playoffs]] appearance.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  In 1969, he led the team to its first [[NFL Championship]] and their first appearance in the [[Super Bowl]].  The Vikings lost in [[Super Bowl IV]] to the [[American Football League]] champion [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  During the 1970s, the Vikings would appear in three more Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]], [[Super Bowl IX|IX]], and [[Super Bowl XI|XI]]) under Grant and lose each one<ref name="Manly" />, but was the first coach to lead a team to four Super Bowls.  He retired after the [[1983 NFL season]] and was succeeded by [[Les Steckel]], who led the team through a three win, thirteen loss record the following season.<ref name="Manly" />  Steckel was fired as head coach after the [[1984 NFL season|1984 season]] and Grant returned as coach for the Vikings in 1985.<ref name="Manly" />  At the conclusion of the [[1985 NFL season|1985 season]], Grant retired for a second time and was succeeded by [[Jerry Burns]].<ref name="Manly" />  Grant retired as the eighth most winning coach in NFL history with an overall record of 161 wins, 99 losses, and 5 ties.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />  During his tenure with the Vikings, he lead the Vikings to four Super Bowls, eleven division titles, one NFL Championship, and three Conference Championships.<ref name="VikingUpdate" />

==Post-coaching career==
After coaching football, Grant became a less prominent public figure and focused his time on hunting and fishing<ref name="legacy">{{cite web|title=Grant's legacy still looms in Minnesota|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=117009|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=[[2006-08-12]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> and supporting environmental reforms. He has been a spokesperson opposing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[hunting]] and [[fishing]] treaty rights in [[Minnesota]]. In 1993, Grant's efforts resulted in a death threat.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web|title=Grant Receives A Death Threat|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD61239F933A25752C0A965958260|date=[[1993-01-10]]|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>  In 2005, he spoke at a Capitol [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] in Minnesota for the conservation of [[wetlands]], wetland [[wildlife]], and [[water]].<ref name="rally">{{cite web|title=Rally hats on|url=http://www.mepartnership.org/mep_whatsnew.asp?new_id=993|last=Anderson|first=Dennis|publisher=Minnesota Environmental Partnership|date=[[2005-01-11]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>  Grant addressed the five thousand supporters saying, "In this [legislative] session, we want to see some action. It<U+2019>s more important than any stadium they could ever build in this state."<ref name="outdoors">{{cite web|title=Open water has returned once again|url=http://www.herald-journal.com/outdoors/2005/c041105.html|last=Schultz
