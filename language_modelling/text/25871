'''''Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark''''' ([[1796 in literature|1796]]), the last published work by [[eighteenth-century]] British [[feminist]] [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is a deeply personal [[travel literature|travel narrative]]. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on [[Scandinavia]] and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity.

Wollstonecraft undertook her Scandinavian tour in order to resolve some business disputes for her lover, [[Gilbert Imlay]]. Believing that the journey would restore their strained relationship, she eagerly set off. However, over the course of the three months she spent in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters which make up the text, drawn from her journal and from missives sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. ''Letters Written in Sweden'' is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical [[memoir]].

Using the rhetoric of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], Wollstonecraft, who believed that travel narratives should have a unifying theme, explains her ideas regarding the relationship between the self and society. She argues for the value of subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature; champions the liberation and education of women; and illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society.

''Letters Written in Sweden'' was Wollstonecraft's most popular book<U+2014>it sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics. Philosopher [[William Godwin]], enamored of the book and its author, wrote "if ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book."<ref name=Godwin95>Godwin, 95.</ref> ''Letters Written in Sweden'' influenced [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who drew on its themes and adopted its aesthetic. While the book inspired many readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life. 

==Biographical background==
[[Image:Marywollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] by [[John Opie]] (c. 1797)]]
Not only was Wollstonecraft's journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman traveling alone during [[French Revolutionary Wars|a time of war]]), it was also laced with sorrow and anger. After learning of the infidelity of her lover, the American adventurer [[Gilbert Imlay]], with whom she had had an [[Fanny Imlay|illegitimate daughter]], Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May of 1795; Imlay, however, managed to save her. She subsequently agreed to undertake the long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia to resolve some of Imlay's business difficulties. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after he failed to meet her in [[Hamburg]].<ref>Jacobus, 64; 68; Holmes, 18.</ref> Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed; frequently returning to the topic of death, ''Letters Written in Sweden'' can be considered a suicide note addressed to Imlay, although he is never named in the text.<ref>Swaab, 19.</ref> Upon her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft, realizing that her affair with Imlay was over, tried to commit suicide a second time: she attempted to drown herself in the [[Thames]] but was rescued by passersby.<ref>Jacobus, 64.</ref> ''Letters Written in Sweden'', which draws on the diary she kept during her travels as well as private letters to Imlay, was published in January of 1796 by Wollstonecraft's close friend and life-long publisher, [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].

===Scandinavian journey and Imlay's business interests===
For a woman, a one-year-old child and a maid to travel to Scandinavia alone was unprecedented in the eighteenth century.<ref name=Moskal2645>Moskal, 264-65.</ref> The book resulting from the trip would also have seemed highly unusual to readers at the time; details of Wollstonecraft's travels to <U+201C>a largely unknown region, almost . . . a boreal wilderness<U+201D> would have intrigued and even shocked contemporary readers.<ref name=Holmes167>Holmes, 16-17.</ref>

Although Wollstonecraft appears as a tourist in the text, she was actually conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear why she had traveled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s Per Nystr<U+00F6>m uncovered documents in local archives relating to her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and its cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay authorized Wollstonecraft to conduct all of his business, referring to her in legal documents as <U+201C>Mrs. Mary Imlay<U+201D>, <U+201C>my best friend and wife<U+201D>, although the two were not married.<ref>Nystr<U+00F6>m, 18.</ref>

[[image:Wollstonecraftlettersmap.png|thumb|250px|left|Route of Wollstonecraft's travels]]
The details of Imlay's business dealings are intricate, but laid out clearly by Nystr<U+00F6>m. On [[18 June]] [[1794]], Peder Ellefsen, who belonged to a rich and influential Norwegian family, bought a ship called the ''Liberty'' from agents of Imlay in [[Le Havre, France]]. It would later become clear that Ellefson never owned the ship but rather engaged in a [[wikt:pro-forma|pro-forma]] sale on behalf of Imlay. He renamed the ship the ''Maria and Margaretha'' (presumably after Mary and her maid Marguerite) and had the Danish Consulate in Le Havre certify it so that the ship could pass through the [[French Revolutionary Wars|British blockade of France]] (Imlay was a [[blockade runner]]). The ship departed France in August of 1794, sailing under a Danish flag and carrying  gold [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] plate and silver, and arrived at [[Copenhagen]] on 20 August. Although Ellefsen supposedly ordered the ship to continue on to [[Gothenburg]], it never reached its destination. Imlay engaged in several fruitless attempts to locate the ship and its valuable cargo and then dispatched Wollstonecraft to negotiate an agreement with Ellefsen, who had subsequently been arrested for stealing the ship and its contents. It is still not known how successful Wollstonecraft was or what happened to the ship and its treasure.<ref>Nystr<U+00F6>m, 22ff.</ref>

To engage in these negotiations, Wollstonecraft traveled first to Gothenburg, where she remained for two weeks. Leaving Fanny and her nurse, Marguerite behind, she embarked for [[Str<U+00F6>mstad]] in Sweden, where she took a short detour to visit the [[Fredriksten|fortress of Fredriksten]], and proceeded to [[Larvik]], Norway. From there she traveled to [[T<U+00F6>nsberg]], Norway, where she spent three weeks. She then went on to [[Helgeraa]], [[Ris<U+00F8>r]], [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo) and then returned by way of Str<U+00F6>mstad and Gothenburg, where she picked up Fanny and Marguerite again. She returned to England by way of Copenhagen and Hamburg, finally landing at [[Dover]] in September of 1795, three months after she had left her home country.<ref>Nystr<U+00F6>m 9-10.</ref>

==Structure, genre and style==
''Letters Written in Sweden'' consists of twenty-five letters that address a wide range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, as well as less controversial subjects, such as gardening, [[History of salt|salt works]], and [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'' (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed by her own experiences in [[French revolution|revolutionary France]] and those of her friends, many of whom were jailed.<ref>Holmes, 26; Swaab, 22-23.</ref>

While at first glance ''Letters Written in Sweden'' appears to be a [[travel literature|travel narrative]], it is actually a <U+201C>generic hybrid<U+201D>. The nature of this hybridity, however, is not altogether agreed upon by scholars. Some emphasize Wollstonecraft's fusion of the travelogue with the [[autobiography]] or [[memoir]] (a word used by Wollstonecraft in the book's advertisement)<ref>Myers, 166; Swaab, 16.</ref> while others see it as a travelogue ''cum'' [[epistolary novel]].<ref>Swaab, 17.</ref> The text, which reveals Wollstonecraft's internal thought processes, flows seamlessly from autobiographical reflections to musings on nature to political theories.<ref>Myers, 166; 181.</ref> This wide-ranging commentary has several unifying threads; the first is Wollstonecraft's arguments regarding the nature and progress of society; the second is her increasing melancholy.<ref>Holmes, 19; Tomalin, ?; Myers, 166, referencing Wardle.</ref> As Wollstonecraft scholar Mary Poovey writes, the text <U+201C>details the narrator's passage from an initial state of poised expectation . . . through a period of energetic exploration, observation, and self-discovery, to a gradual decline into melancholy and anger.<U+201D><ref>Poovey, 92; see also, Myers, 170; Swaab, 25.</ref> Although Wollstonecraft aims to write as a philosopher, it is the image of the suffering woman that dominates the book.<ref>Kelly, 178; Myers, 171.</ref>

===Travel narrative===
[[Image:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|[[Rousseau]] by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1753)]]
''Letters Written in Sweden'' is an epistolary travel narrative.<ref name=Myers16970>Myers, 169-70.</ref> Wollstonecraft's conception of this genre was shaped by eighteenth-century empirical and moral travel narratives, particularly [[Oliver Goldsmith|Oliver Goldsmith's]] ''The Traveller, or a Prospect of Society'' (1764), [[Laurence Sterne|Laurence Sterne's]] ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' (1768), [[Samuel Johnson|Samuel Johnson's]] ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'' (1775), [[James Boswell|James Boswell's]] ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides|Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785), and [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young's]] travel books.<ref>Myers, 173; Swaab, 17-18; Kelly, 177; Holmes, 17; Parks, 32.</ref> However, like Sterne, she also accorded emotion a prominent place in her travelogue.

One scholar has called Wollstonecraft the <U+201C>complete passionate traveler<U+201D>.<ref>Parks, 33.</ref> Her desire to delve into and fully experience each moment in time was fostered by the works of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], particularly his ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' (1782).<ref>Sapiro, 286-7; Jacobus, 64; Todd, 368; Favret, 104.</ref> Several of Rousseau's themes appear in the ''Letters Written in Sweden'', such as "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding".<ref name=Favret1046>Favret, 104-106.</ref> However, while Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates both domestic scenes and industrial progress.<ref name=Favret1046/>

After reviewing twenty-four travel books for [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson's]] ''[[Analytical Review]]'' (mostly in 1790 and 1791), Wollstonecraft was well-versed in the genre. This extensive reading solidified her ideas of what constituted a good travel book: travel writers, she writes in one review, should have <U+201C>some decided point in view, a grand object of pursuit to concentrate their thoughts, and connect their reflections<U+201D> and their books should not be <U+201C>detached observations, which no running interest, or prevailing bent in the mind of the writer rounds into a whole<U+201D>.<ref>Qtd. in Swaab, 15; see also, Swaab, 14; Myers, 166; Kelly, 177.</ref> Her reviews praise detailed and engaging descriptions of people and places, musings on history, and an insatiable curiosity in the traveler.<ref>Swaab, 14; see also Holmes, 32.</ref>

<U+201C>The art of travel is only a branch of the art of thinking", Wollstonecraft wrote.<ref>Qtd. in Swaab, 15.</ref> Her journey and her comments on it are, therefore, not only sentimental but also philosophical; she uses the two modes to continue the cultural critiques regarding women and the progress of civilization she had outlined in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790), ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution''.<ref name=Kelly1789>Kelly, 178-79.</ref> She brought what Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly calls "Revolutionary feminism" to yet another genre that had typically been considered the purview of male writers,<ref name=Kelly1789/> transforming the travel narrative's "blend of objective facts and individual impressions . . . into a rationale for autobiographical revelation.<U+201D><ref name=Myers181/> As one editor of the ''Letters Written in Sweden'' writes, the book is <U+201C>nothing less than a revolution in literary genres<U+201D>; its sublimity, expressed through scenes of intense feeling, suggests that <U+201C>a new wildness and richness of emotional rhetoric<U+201D> is desirable in travel literature.<ref name=Holmes167/>

===Autobiography===
Heavily influenced by Rousseau's frank and revealing ''[[Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Confessions]]'', Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in ''Letters Written in Sweden''. The letters detail both a physical and a psychological journey.<ref>Myers, 176; Poovey, 89; Kelly, 187.</ref> Her personal disclosures share many of the tendencies of other female autobiographers, such as <U+201C>unpremeditated self-revelations<U+201D> and <U+201C>circuitous<U+201D> thinking and writing.<ref>For a study of female autobiography, see Patricia Meyer Spacks, ''Imagining a Self''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1976) and Felicity A. Nussbaum, ''The Autobiographical Subject: Gender and Ideology in Eighteenth-Century England''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press (1989).</ref> However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers has made clear, Wollstonecraft also manages to turn this style of writing into something <U+201C>continuous<U+201D> that is capable of representing a coherent self.<ref name=Myers16970/> Wollstonecraft, increasingly confident of her authorial talents, controls the narrative and its effect on readers to a degree not matched by her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.<ref>Poovey, 85; Todd, 368.</ref>

===Sublimity===
[[Image:Trollhattefallen.jpg|thumb|right|Waterfall in [[Trollh<U+00E4>ttan]] that Wollstonecraft visited]]
<!--other option for an image [[Image:Joseph Anton Koch 010.jpg|thumb|right|"Waterfall" by [[Joseph Anton Koch]] (1796)]]-->
Wollstonecraft relies extensively on the language of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] in ''Letters Written in Sweden''. Drawing on, but at the same time reshaping, [[Edmund Burke|Edmund Burke's]] ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', she redefines his central aesthetic categories: the sublime and the beautiful. While Burke privileges the sublime (which he associates with masculinity, terror, awe and strength) over the beautiful (which he associates with femininity, passivity, delicacy, and weakness), Wollstonecraft ties the sublime to sterility and the beautiful to fertility. For her, the beautiful is connected to the maternal; this aesthetic shift is evident, for example, in the many passages focusing on the affectionate tie between Wollstonecraft and little Fanny, her daughter. She thus claims the feminine category of the "beautiful" for virtuous and useful women: mothers.<ref>Moskal, 264; see also 277-78.</ref>

Wollstonecraft also revises the conventional associations between the sublime and death; thoughts of death, prompted by a waterfall, for example, lead her to contemplate rebirth and immortality as well:
<blockquote>
Reaching the cascade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which had a long time announced its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares <U+2013> grasping at immortality <U+2013> it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me <U+2013> I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 152-53.</ref>
</blockquote>
Like her other manipulations of the discourse of the sublime, this one is also heavily inflected by gender: <U+201C>because Wollstonecraft is a woman, and is therefore bound by the legal and social restrictions placed on her sex in the eighteenth century, she can only envisage autonomy of any form after death.<U+201D><ref>Moore, 149-50.</ref>

==Themes==
[[Image:Caspar David Friedrich 032.jpg|thumb|left|"The wanderer above the sea of fog" by [[Caspar David Friedrich]] (1818)]]
===Reason, feeling and imagination===
Often categorized as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates her commitment to and appreciation of the role of feeling in the construction of the self in ''Letters Written in Sweden''. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful in the natural world, have a value equal to that of objective truths founded on reason.<ref>Poovey, 83-84; Myers, 167.</ref> In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, particularly ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', reason was the final arbiter because it allowed one to access universal truths. However, in ''Letters Written in Sweden'' reason does not dominate her descriptions of ratiocination<U+2014>reason serves as the tool for reflection, mediating between one's sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation, then, is not only the acquisition of reason, the view she adopts in ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788), but also an understanding of when and how to rely on one's emotions.<ref>Poovey, 85-86; see also Myers, 180.</ref>

Closely tied to Wollstonecraft's comments on reason and feeling are her ideas on the imagination. She contrasts the creative imagination and its ability to connect with the natural world to the destructive impact of commerce. By associating commercialism with the anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who Wollstonecraft believed cared more for his business speculations than for her and their child.<ref>Favret, 119ff.</ref> Some scholars contend that Wollstonecraft uses the imagination to liberate the self, especially the feminine self; it allows her to envision roles for women outside the traditional bounds of eighteenth-century thought and offers her a way to articulate those new ideas.<ref>Myers, 180; Poovey, 106</ref> In contrast, other scholars view Wollstonecraft's emphasis on the power of the imagination as detrimental, binding her to an <U+201C>individualized, bourgeois desire<U+201D> which can never truly embrace sociality.<ref>Poovey, 106; see also, Kaplan, 239.</ref>

===Individual in society===
Throughout ''Letters Written in Sweden'' Wollstonecraft ponders the relationship between society and the individual. While her earlier works focus, to a large extent, on society's failings and responsibilities, in this work she turns inward, explicitly arguing for the value of personal experience.<ref>Todd, 367.</ref> She explains her role as the "hero" of the text in the advertisement:
<!--dashes and their spaces have been copied exactly from the source - please do not change-->
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
In writing these desultory letters, I found I could not avoid being continually the first person <U+2013> 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 63.</ref>
</blockquote>
Throughout the book, Wollstonecraft ties her own psychic journey and maturation to the progress of civilizations. Nations, like individuals, she maintains have <U+201C>a collective 'understanding' that evolves organically, 'ripening' gradually to fruition<U+201D>.<ref>Poovey, 85; see also, Kelly, 187-88; Myers, 166.</ref> However, Wollstonecraft still views civilization's tragedies as worthier of concern than individual or fictional tragedies. For example, she relates the suffering of the citizens of Copenhagen rather than enthusing over the "sublime" ruins of their city, suggesting that, for her, sympathy is at the core of social relations:<ref>Moska, 283.</ref> 
<!--dashes and their spaces have been copied exactly from the source - please do not change-->
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
I have then considered myself as a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; <U+2014> I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still a part of a mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself <U+2014> not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 69-70.</ref>
</blockquote>
===Nature===
Wollstonecraft dedicates significant portions of ''Letters Written in Sweden'' to descriptions of nature and her concomitant emotional responses. One of her most effective tactics is to convey her thoughts and feelings while at the same time describing a specific natural formations, such as a waterfall. Nature, Wollstonecraft assumes, is <U+201C>a common reference point<U+201D> between the reader and herself. Focusing on what she believes is a universal experience, her letters generate a sense of social sympathy with the reader.<ref>Poovey, 88; Kelly, 189-90.</ref> Many of the letters contain such <U+201C>miniature Romantic excursus<U+201D> which illustrate Wollstonecraft's ideas regarding the connection between nature, God and the self.<ref>Myers, 178; see also Holmes, 26.</ref> The natural world becomes <U+201C>the necessary ground of speculation and the crucial field of experience<U+201D>.<ref>Poovey, 88.</ref>

===Gender===
[[Image:Caroline Mathilde by Juel.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caroline Matilda of Wales|Queen Caroline of Denmark]] by [[Jens Juel (painter)|Jens Juel]] (1771)]]
All of Wollstonecraft's writings, including the ''Letters Written in Sweden'', address the concerns of women in eighteenth-century society. As in previous works, she discusses concrete issues such as child care and relationships with servants, but unlike her more [[polemic]]al books, this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity.<ref name=Moskal2645/> Yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women's education and rights. In Letter 19, the most explicitly feminist letter, Wollstonecraft anticipates readers' criticisms: <U+201C>still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim <U+2013> How can I avoid it, when most of the struggles of an eventful life have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex: we reason deeply, when we forcibly feel.<U+201D><ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 171.</ref><!--dashes and spacing copied exactly from the text - please do not change--> Despite her attempts otherwise, Wollstonecraft always experiences, nay, is forced to experience the world as a woman<U+2014>it is the defining feature of her sense of self and that of all women.<ref>Poovey, 89; Jacobus, 74.</ref> 

Throughout ''Letters Written in Sweden'', Wollstonecraft comments on the precarious position women occupy in society. She defends [[Caroline Matilda of Wales|Queen Caroline of Denmark]], for example, who had been accused of "licentiousness" for her extra-marital affair during her marriage to the insane [[Christian VII of Denmark|Christian VII]]. Wollstonecraft describes this royal, who was also a progressive social reformer, as a woman of courage who tried to revolutionize her country before it was ready.<ref> Jacobus, 75; Todd, 368, Swaab, 25-26.</ref> Such examples fuel her increasing despair and melancholy. At one point, she laments the fate of her daughter:
<!--dashes and spacing copied exactly from the text - please do not change-->
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her <U+2013> I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard <U+2013> I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit <U+2013> Hapless woman! what a fate is thine!<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 97.</ref>
</blockquote>
Wollstonecraft's anger and frustration over the secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity. In the first letter she proudly announces <U+201C>at supper my host hold me bluntly that I was a woman of observation, for I asked him ''men's questions''<U+201D> (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 68; see also Myers, 174.</ref>

===Revolution and progress===
Wollstonecraft spends much of ''Letters Written in Sweden'' speculating about the possibilities of social and political revolution and outlining a trajectory for the progress of civilization. In comparing Norway with Britain and France, for example, she argues that the Norwegians are more progressive because they have a [[Freedom of the press|free press]], embrace [[religious toleration]], distribute their land fairly, and have a politically active populace. However, her description of Norway's <U+201C>golden age<U+201D><ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 66.</ref> becomes less rhapsodic after she discovers that the country has no universities or scientists.<ref name=Taylor16970>Taylor, 169-70.</ref>

In many ways Norwegian society embodied the British [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|radical]] ideal of <U+201C>a small-producer society, its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality<U+201D>.<ref name=Taylor16970/> After careful consideration of how to improve the social and political problems in the places she visited, Wollstonecraft came to the conclusion that social progress must occur at a measured and <U+201C>natural<U+201D> rate. She argues that each country has to find its own way to improve, that democratic revolution cannot be foisted upon a people.<ref>Furniss, 79.</ref> She believed that the lower classes and the [[yeomen]] were the most promising <U+201C>potential source of revolutionary social transformation<U+201D>.<ref>Kelly, 186; see also 181.</ref> Implicit in her assessment, however, was a [[bourgeois]] condescension; she viewed the lower classes as a group separate from herself, at one point describing their behavior as <U+201C>picturesque<U+201D>.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 184.</ref>

===Commercialism===
Although Wollstonecraft spends much of ''Letters Written in Sweden'' musing on nature and its connection to the self, a great deal of the text is actually about the debasing effects of commerce on a culture. She argues, for example, that the damage done to Hamburg and France by mercenaries and an increasingly commercial culture is far greater than the damage caused by [[French revolution|revolutionary violence]], writing that <U+201C>the sword has been merciful, compared with the depredations made on human life by contractors, and by the swarm of locusts who have battened on the pestilence they spread abroad<U+201D>.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 195; see also Todd, 369; Kelly, 179; 181.</ref> Wollstonecraft had become disenchanted with Imlay not only because of his dismissive attitude towards her but also because of his greed. Throughout ''Letters Written in Sweden'', she attaches criticisms of commerce to the anonymous lover who has betrayed her:
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
A man ceases to love humanity, and then individuals, as he advances in the chase after wealth; as one clashes with his interest, the other with his pleasures: to business, as it is termed, every thing must give way; nay, is sacrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, husband, father, brother, become empty names.<ref>Wollstonecraft (Holmes/Penguin), 193.</ref>}}
</blockquote>
Wollstonecraft believed that commerce <U+201C>embruted<U+201D> the mind and fostered a selfish disposition in its practitioners.<ref>Jacobus, 67; Poovey, 93; Myers, 177.</ref> Commerce should be, she thought, <U+201C>regulated by ideas of justice and fairness and directed toward the ideals of independence and benevolence.<U+201D><ref>Jones, 53.</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
Wollstonecraft was prompted to publish ''Letters Written in Sweden'' because she was in a great deal of debt, thus the successful sales of this, her most popular book, came at an opportune moment.<ref>Todd, 367; Furniss, 77; Kaplan, 262; Holmes, 36; Sapiro, 35</ref> Well-received by reviewers, the work was translated into German, Dutch, Swedish and Portuguese, published in America and issued in a second edition in 1802.<ref>Holmes, 36; Todd, 369-70; Kelly, 194.</ref> The ''Monthly Magazine'' in New York wrote:
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
I saw her there the child of nature and the sport of feeling: yet, like a lovely infant smiling through its tears, changing alternately from anguish to delight; for in the midst of gloom her exquisite genius darted ever and anew, like sunshine on her mind, through the crevices of the clouds which hung upon it. I saw her there reasoning and philosophizing with all the powers and the skill of a rational being, yet secretly preyed upon by circumstances which her reflections on the vicissitudes of life might have taught her to expect, and her firmness of mind should have prepared her to encounter.<ref>Qtd. in Kelly, 194.</ref>

[[Amelia Opie]] praised the work, separating the philosopher from the woman: <U+201C>As soon as I read your Letters from Norway, the cold awe which the philosopher had excited was lost in the tender sympathy call'd forth by the woman.<U+201D><ref>Qtd. in Poovey, 82; see also Swaab, 27.</ref> [[William Godwin]], Wollstonecraft's future husband, wrote in his ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' that reading ''Letters Written in Sweden'' caused him to fall in love with Wollstonecraft:

<blockquote>
If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.<ref name=Godwin95/>
</blockquote>
Connecting the work to Wollstonecraft's first novel, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788), he celebrates its [[sensibility]] while at the same time <U+201C>eroticiz[ing] the condition of feminine sorrow<U+201D>.<ref>Jacobus, 65; Todd, 449.</ref>

Not all of the responses were positive, however. The unorthodox theology of the book alienated some readers.<ref name=Pooveynote>Poovey, 256, n. 8.</ref> The '' Monthly Magazine and American Review'' wrote:
<!--please do not add c-quotes - they are unnecessary-->
<blockquote>
[She] discarded all faith in christianity. . . . From this period she adored [God] . . . not as one whose interposing power is every silently at work on the grand theatre of human affairs, causing eventual good to spring from present evil, and permitting nothing but for wise and benevolent purposes; but merely as the first great cause and vital spring of existence.<ref name=Pooveynote/>

''Letters Written in Sweden'' had retreated from Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, shocking some conservative readers who were not prepared to accept anything like [[deism]]. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author [[Mary Hays]] criticized the book's mawkishness.<ref>Swaab, 21; 27.</ref> A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, ''The Wanderer in Norway''. Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented her work as a failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a [[cautionary tale]] while Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform.<ref>Holmes, 42 Swaab, 27.</ref>

Nevertheless, <U+201C>the book was to arouse a passion for travel among cultivated people in Europe<U+201D> and it was republished in the late nineteenth century. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], the author of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', took a copy along on his trip to [[Samoa]] in 1890.<ref>Nystr<U+00F6>m 8; Holmes, 36.</ref> However, it was British female travel writers such as [[Isabella Bird]] and [[Mary Kingsley]] that benefited most from Wollstonecraft's pioneering efforts.<ref>Holmes, 41.</ref> After the publication of Godwin's ''Memoirs'', which revealed and endorsed Wollstonecraft's love affairs and illegitimate children, her works were scorned by the majority of the public.

===Romanticism===
The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets were more profoundly affected by ''Letters Written in Sweden'' than anyone, except perhaps Godwin. The poet [[Robert Southey]], for example, wrote to his publisher: <U+201C>Have you met with Mary Wollstonecraft's [travel book]? She has made me in love with a cold climate, and frost and snow, with a northern moonlight.<U+201D><ref>Qtd. in Holmes, 17.</ref> The book's combination of progressive social views with the advocacy of individual subjective experience influenced writers such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].<ref>Holmes, 41; Sapiro, 35.</ref> Wordsworth's <U+201C>Ruined Cottage<U+201D>, for example, shows a retreat from politics into the <U+201C>private, affective sphere<U+201D> similar to Wollstonecraft's in ''Letters Written in Sweden''.<ref>Jacobus, 77; see also Swaab, 26.</ref> More importantly, Wollstonecraft's <U+201C>incarnational theory of the creative imagination<U+201D> paved the way for Wordsworth's thorough treatment of the imagination and its relation to the self in Book V of ''[[The Prelude]]'' (1805; 1850).<ref>Swaab, 20; Poovey, 89.</ref> Her book also had a profound effect on Coleridge's ''[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1797<U+2013>99) and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley's]] ''[[Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude|Alastor]]'' (1815); their depictions of <U+201C>quest[s] for a settled home<U+201D> strongly resemble Wollstonecraft's in ''Letters Written in Sweden''.<ref>Swaab, 24.</ref> The most striking homage to Wollstonecraft's work, however, is in Coleridge's famous poem <U+201C>[[Kubla Khan]]<U+201D> (1797; 1816).<ref>Holmes, 39; Moore, 146.</ref> Not only does much of his style descend from the book, but at one point he writes of the cold wasteland that serves as his setting: 
<poem>
:A savage place! as holy and enchanted
:As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted
:By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<ref>Qtd. in Holmes, 41.</ref>
</poem>
