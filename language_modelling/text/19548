A '''mountain''' is a large [[landform]] that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a '''[[hill]]'''. The adjective '''montane''' is used to describe mountainous areas and things associated with them. The study of mountains is [[Orology]]. 

[[Exogeology]] deals with planetary mountains, which in that branch of science are usually called ''montes'' (singular - ''mons''). The highest mountain on earth is the [[Mount Everest]] (elevation 8,848 m). The highest known mountain in the [[Solar System]] is [[Olympus Mons]] on the planet [[Mars]] at {{convert|21171|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

==Definition==
There is no universally-accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity has been used as criteria for defining a mountain.<ref name=gerrard>Gerrard, A. J. 1990. Mountain Environments</ref> In the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."<ref name=gerrard/>     

In the [[United States]], the following points of measurement have been used and taught in geography classes:{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
* Flat to 500 feet, base to highest point - Rolling Plain
* Highest point 501 to 999 feet above base - Hill
* Highest point 1000 feet or more above base - Mountain
Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on usage among the local people. The highest point in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], is called [[Mount Davidson]], notwithstanding its height of 990 feet, which makes it ten feet short of the minimum for a mountain in American appellation.

Other definitions of "mountain" include: <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unep-wcmc.org/mountains/mountain_watch/pdfs/WholeReport.pdf |author= Blyth, S., Groombridge, B., Lysenko, I., Miles, L. & Newton, A. |title= Mountain Watch |date=2002 |publisher= UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref>
* Height over base of at least 2,500m
* Height over base of 1500-2500m with a slope greater than 2 degrees
* Height over base of 1000-1500m with a slope greater than 5 degrees
* Local (radius 7&nbsp;km) elevation greater than 300m, or 300-1000m if local (radius 7&nbsp;km) elevation is greater than 300m
By this definition, mountains cover 64% of [[Asia]], 25% of [[Europe]], 22% of [[South America]], 17% of [[Australia]], and 3% of [[Africa]]. As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous and 10% of people live in mountainous regions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.panos.org.uk/?lid=278 |author= Panos |date = 2002 |title= High Stakes |accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> Most of the world's rivers are fed from mountain sources, and more than half of humanity depends on mountains for water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wateryear2003.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3903&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html |title=International Year of Freshwater 2003 |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mountain.org/mountains/whymtns.cfm?slidepage=water |title=The Mountain Institute |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref>

==Characteristics==

High mountains, as well as those located close to the Earth's poles, reach into the colder layers of the atmosphere. They are consequently subject to [[glaciation]], and [[erosion]] through frost action. Such processes produce the [[pyramidal peak|peak]] shape. Some of these mountains have [[glacial lake]]s, created by melting glaciers; for example, there are an estimated 3,000 glacial lakes in [[Bhutan]]. Mountains can be [[erosion|eroded]] and [[weathering|weathered]], altering their characteristics over time.

Tall mountains have different climatic conditions at the top than at the base, and will thus have different [[life zone]]s at different altitudes. The flora and fauna found in these zones tend to become isolated since the conditions above and below a particular zone will be inhospitable to those organisms. These isolated ecological systems are known as [[sky island]]s and/or [[microclimates]]. [[Alpine forest]]s are forests on mountain sides.

Mountains are colder than lower ground, because the Sun heats Earth from the ground up. The Sun's radiation travels through the atmosphere to the ground, where Earth absorbs the heat. Air closest to the Earth's surface is, in general, warmest (see [[lapse rate]] for details). Air temperature normally drops 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for each 300 meters (1000 ft) of altitude.

Mountains are generally less preferable for [[human]] habitation than lowlands; the weather is often harsher, and there is little level ground suitable for [[agriculture]]. At very high altitudes, there is less [[oxygen]] in the air and less protection against solar radiation ([[Ultraviolet|UV]]). [[Acute mountain sickness]] (caused by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] - a lack of oxygen in the blood) affects over half of lowlanders who spend more than a few hours above 3,500 meters (11,483 ft).

Many mountains and mountain ranges throughout the world have been left in their natural state, and are today primarily used for [[recreation]], while others are used for [[logging]], [[mining]], [[grazing]], or see little use. Some mountains offer spectacular views from their summits, while others are densely wooded. Summit accessibility is affected by height, steepness, latitude, terrain, weather. [[Road]]s, [[ski lift|lifts]], or [[aerial tramway|tramways]] affect accessibility. [[Hiking]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[mountaineering]], [[rock climbing]], [[ice climbing]], [[downhill skiing]], and [[snowboarding]] are recreational activities enjoyed on mountains. Mountains that support heavy recreational use (especially downhill skiing) are often the locations of [[mountain resort]]s.

==Types of mountains==

Mountains can be characterized in several ways. Some mountains are [[volcanoes]] and can be characterized by the type of lava. Other mountains are shaped by [[glacier|glacial processes]] and can be characterized by their [[glaciated]] features. Still others are typified by the [[fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[fold (geology)|folding]] of the Earth's crust, or by the collision of [[continental plates]] via [[plate tectonics]] (the [[Himalayas]], for instance). Shape and placement within the overall landscape also define mountains and mountainous structures (such as [[butte]] and [[monadnock]]). Finally, mountains can be characterized by the type of [[rock (geology)|rock]] that make up their composition.

A mountain is usually produced by the movement of [[lithospheric]] plates, either [[orogeny|orogenic movement]] or [[epeirogenic movement]]. The compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of [[igneous rock|igneous matter]] forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. The absolute heights of features termed mountains and hills vary greatly according to an area's [[terrain]]. The major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity. Two types of mountain are formed depending on how the rock reacts to the tectonic forces <U+2013> block mountains or fold mountains.

Compressional forces in continental collisions may cause the compressed region to thicken, so the upper surface is forced upward. In order to balance the weight of the earth surface, much of the compressed rock is forced ''downward'', producing deep "mountain roots" [see the Book of "Earth", Press and Siever page.413]. Mountains therefore form downward as well as upward (see [[isostasy]]). However, in some continental collisions part of one continent may simply ''override'' part of the others, crumpling in the process.

Some isolated mountains were produced by [[volcano]]es, including many apparently small [[island]]s that reach a great height above the [[ocean]] floor.

Block mountains are created when large areas are widely broken up by faults creating large vertical displacements. This occurrence is fairly common. The uplifted blocks are block mountains or ''[[Horst (geology)|horsts]]''. The intervening dropped blocks are termed ''[[graben]]'': these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of [[landscape]] can be seen in [[East Africa]], the [[Vosges]], the [[Basin and Range]] province of Western [[North America]] and the [[Rhine]] valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the [[crust (geology)|crust]] is thinned.

The [[mid-ocean ridge]]s are often referred to as undersea mountain ranges due to their bathymetric prominence.

Rock that does not fault may fold, either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are ''anticlines'' and the downfolds are ''synclines'': in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura mountains are an example of folding. Over time, erosion can bring about an inversion of relief: the soft upthrust rock is worn away so the anticlines are actually lower than the tougher, more compressed rock of the synclines.
