'''Town of Mount Royal''' is a town located on the northwest side of [[Mount Royal]], north of downtown [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]], on the [[Island of Montreal]] in southwestern [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. pop. 18,933 ([[Statistics Canada]], 2006).

The community is commonly referred to as the Town of Mount Royal (in French, ''Ville Mont-Royal''), or by the abbreviation TMR (VMR in French).

==History==
[[Image:CarteDuTunnelMontRoyal.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Plan of <U+201C>Model City<U+201D> and of the railroad tunnel]]
The town was founded in 1912. It was created at the initiative of the [[Canadian Northern Railway]]. The town was designed by [[Frederic Todd]], a planner who was heavily influenced by the likes of [[Ebenezer Howard]] and incorporated many aspects of the [[City Beautiful]] movement into his design.  <ref>Sewell, John. "The Shape of the City: Toronto Struggles with Modern Planning" 
page 52 ''University of Toronto Press Inc.'' 1993</ref> The plan was to build a [[new town]] (or "model city" as it was called) at the foot of the mountain.  The company bought 4,800 acres (19 km<U+00B2>) of farmland, and then built a rail tunnel under Mount Royal connecting their land to downtown Montreal. The profits from the venture helped finance the development of Canadian Northern's transcontinental railroad, which eventually became a significant constituent of the Canadian National Railway system. The town was designed by Canadian Northern's chief engineer, [[Henry Wicksteed]], based loosely on [[Washington, DC]].

Mount Royal has always been an upper-income community, and until the 1960s its population was almost exclusively [[anglophone]] and largely of [[English people|English]] or [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry. This began to change after the [[Quiet Revolution]], as [[francophone]]s gained access to the well-paying careers. Mount Royal became popular and today the community is 46% francophone.

The town was merged with the city of Montreal on [[January 1]], [[2002]]. On [[June 20]], [[2004]] the residents of the town voted to demerge from Montreal following the [[Municipal reorganization in Quebec#Calls for de-amalgamation|calls for de-amalgamation]]. Mount Royal was re-established as a town on [[January 1]], [[2006]]. 

Starting in June 2006, the town accepted to convert the designations on their bilingual street signs to French only signs, as mandated by law. This came after repeated requests from the Quebec French-language office, a provincial agency aimed at promoting French (the official language since 1977)in the province of Quebec (where 82% of the population is French-speaking), and limiting the use of English in public signs and official communications to situations where the anglophone minority is sufficiently high. Some residents complained and the town agreed to reinstate the English lettering on the signs. The new English designations are now smaller than their official French equivalent, in compliance with the 1993 amendment to the [[Charter of the French Language]]. For unknown reasons, there are still street signs for several major boulevards for which the lettering has not been changed back to bilingual. 

One peculiarity of the town is the sometimes odd naming of its streets, and also its occasionally strange numbering system. Some streets may thus bear two names (in whichever language). For example, Jean-Talon avenue, a large East-West thoroughfare crossing Montreal on kilometers, goes through Mount Royal under the name of Dresden Avenue on a few hundred meters, only to recover its Montreal name on the other side of town. This confusion has been recently alleviated by putting the two names on the street signs. On these few hundred meters, Mount Royal uses a house civic numbering totally different from that of Montreal on either side, leading to more confusion. This unexpected change in the numbering system also occurs on smaller streets shared by both Montreal and Mount Royal (for example, Trenton, Lockhart and Brookfield avenues, where the Mount Royal numbering system decreases from East to West, only to jump from 2 to 2400 on the few meters of the street that still belong to Montreal).

==Geography==
Two main thoroughfares, Laird Boulevard and Graham Boulevard, cut across the borough diagonally and meet at Connaught Park, a green space located in the centre. [[Mont-Royal (AMT)|Mount Royal Train Station]] (''Gare Mont-Royal'') is located adjacent to this park, a [[commuter train]] station on the [[Agence m<U+00E9>tropolitaine de transport|AMT]] [[Deux-Montagnes Line (AMT)|Deux-Montagnes]] Line. Trains going through the [[Mount Royal Tunnel]] link the station to downtown Montreal in nine minutes.

Mount Royal is surrounded on three sides by a highway, a rail line and a fence.

The highway is Metropolitan Boulevard, a major constituent of [[Quebec Autoroute 40|Autoroute 40]]. It was built as an elevated highway throughout, except when it passes through Mount Royal (between Sainte Croix Avenue and l'Acadie Boulevard), since the town council requested that it be built on the ground, in order to separate the town from the industrial area to the north.

The rail line is the last portion of [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]]'s Adirondack subdivision. It originally ran through the northern part of the district of [[C<U+00F4>te-des-Neiges]]. However when the town became part of the City of Montreal in 2002, the part of C<U+00F4>te-des-Neiges north of rail line was incorporated into the Mount Royal borough.

A fence runs along the eastern border with [[Park Extension]] at l'Acadie Boulevard. The stated purpose of the fence is to prevent children and house pets from running into the busy thoroughfare but some have contended that it was built to keep residents of the working-class Park Extension neighbourhood out of the town.<ref>[http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/110801/news3.html Kristian Gravenor, "Segregation fence to live on." Montreal Mirror, November 8, 2001.]</ref> This fence originally had several gates built into it, which the became a subject of controversy when they were locked one year at [[Halloween]], preventing children from [[Park Extension]] from [[trick-or-treat]]ing in the town.<ref>"Checkpoint Chocolate: Fence keeps Park Extension trick-or-treaters out of the Town of Mount Royal." Montreal Gazette, November 1, 2001.</ref> The town council responded by removing the gates so that the fence could be crossed at any time at any of the six crosswalks along the 1.2 km boulevard. As of 2007, the gates were restored, with signs explaining that they are for the safety of children and pedestrians.

==Government==
===Municipal===
The current town mayor is [[Vera Danyluk]].

The town is divided into two districts, each of which elect one councillor who, with the town mayor, form the town council. Only the town mayor sits on city council.

====2005 Municipal Elections====
The 2005 election, which took place on [[November 6]], involved a three-way race for mayor between incumbent borough mayor [[Suzanne Caron]], former mayor [[Vera Danyluk]], and [[Brigitte Mack-Arsenault]], president of a municipal watchdog association. The election also involved municipal political parties for the first time. Both Danyluk and Mack-Arsenault formed parties, and Caron, although officially running as an independent, affiliated herself with a group of independent candidates for town council.

Danyluk won the election.

===Federal and Provincial===
The entire borough is located within the federal riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]], and within the smaller provincial electoral district of Mount Royal.
