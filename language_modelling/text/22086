'''''Pipistrellus raceyi''''', also known as '''Racey's pipistrelle bat''', is a [[bat]] from [[Madagascar]], in the genus ''[[Pipistrellus]]''. Although unidentified species of ''Pipistrellus'' were reported previously, ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' was not formally named until 2006. It is apparently most closely related to the Asian species ''[[Pipistrellus endoi|P.&nbsp;endoi]]'', ''[[Pipistrellus paterculus|P.&nbsp;paterculus]]'', and ''[[Pipistrellus abramus|P.&nbsp;abramus]]'', and its ancestors probably reached Madagascar from Asia. ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' has been recorded in four sites, two in the eastern and two in the western lowlands. In the east, it is found in open areas and is known to roost in a building, and in the west it occurs in dry forest. Because of uncertainties about its ecology, it is listed as "[[Data Deficient]]" on the [[IUCN Red List]].

With a forearm length of 28.0 to 31.2&nbsp;mm (1.10 to 1.23&nbsp;in), ''Pipistrellus raceyi'' is a small to medium-sized species with a long penis and [[baculum]] (penis bone) in males, which is somewhat similar to those of ''P.&nbsp;endoi'', ''P.&nbsp;abramus'' and ''P.&nbsp;paterculus''. The body is reddish above and yellow-brown below. The wings are dark and the feet are small. In the skull, the [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] (front part) is less flat than in related species and the [[supraorbital ridge]]s (above the eyes) are well-developed. The fourth upper [[premolar]] does not touch the upper [[canine (tooth)|canine]] and the second lower premolar is well-developed.

==Taxonomy==
Since they were first recorded in 1905 with the description of ''Vespertilio matroka'' by Thomas and Schwann (=''[[Neoromicia matroka]]''), the classification and status of small [[Vespertilionidae|vespertilionid]] bats ("pipistrelles") from Madagascar have remained unclear. Although several species were recorded, they remained little known. A species of the genus ''[[Pipistrellus]]'' with [[Indomalaya ecozone|Oriental]] affinities was first recorded in 1995, and several later authors recorded one or more unidentified ''Pipistrellus'' species. In 2006, Paul Bates and colleagues reported on a collection of 44 Malagasy "pipistrelles" received by the [[Harrison Institute]], which included several species new to Madagascar, as well as a single species new to science.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;299<U+2013>300</ref>

This species, a member of ''Pipistrellus'', was described as ''Pipistrellus raceyi''.<ref name=Bea301>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;301</ref> [[Steven Goodman]] mentioned it as part of a flurry of new [[List of bats of Madagascar|bat species from Madagascar]]; the number of species increased from 27 in 1995 to 37 in 2007.<ref>Goodman, 2007, p.&nbsp;13</ref> The [[specific name]] honors bat researcher [[Paul Racey]] and the describers suggested the [[common name]] "Racey's pipistrelle bat".<ref>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;302</ref> ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' closely resembles the Asian species ''[[Pipistrellus endoi|P.&nbsp;endoi]]'', ''[[Pipistrellus paterculus|P.&nbsp;paterculus]]'', and ''[[Pipistrellus abramus|P.&nbsp;abramus]]'', and Bates and colleagues hypothesized that it may be related to these species. If this is true, the ancestors of ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' presumably reached Madagascar from Asia, not from Africa like most of the island's bat fauna. It shares this distinction with a few other Malagasy bats, like the large fruit bat ''[[Pteropus rufus]]'' and both species of the small insectivorous bat ''[[Emballonura]]'' recorded on Madagascar.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;321</ref>

==Description==
''Pipistrellus raceyi'' is a small to medium-sized pipistrelle.<ref name=Bea302>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;302</ref> It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish brown below. The [[gland]]ular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are not haired. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped [[tragus (ear)|tragus]] (a projection on the inner side of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark and the third through fifth [[metacarpal]]s (hand bones), but the first [[phalange]] (finger bone) on the third finger is short.<ref name=Bea304/> ''P.&nbsp;endoi'' has a longer first phalange on the third metacarpal.<ref name=Bea309>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;309</ref> ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' has short [[tibia]]e (lower leg bones) and small feet and tail length is less than head and body length. Males have a long, straight penis with a notch between the shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped [[glans penis]]. Near the top, the penis is haired, but the base is about naked. In the [[baculum]] (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved.<ref name=Bea304>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;304</ref> The length of the penis and baculum distinguish ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids.<ref name=Bea305/> ''P.&nbsp;endoi'', ''P.&nbsp;paterculus'', and ''P.&nbsp;abramus'' have more similar bacula, but that of ''P.&nbsp;abramus'' is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in ''P.&nbsp;paterculus'', and the proximal (near) end is more robust in ''P.&nbsp;endoi''.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;306<U+2013>307</ref> Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2&nbsp;mm (1.10 to 1.23&nbsp;in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3&nbsp;mm (0.90 to 1.19&nbsp;in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5&nbsp;mm (0.21 to 0.30&nbsp;in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6&nbsp;mm (0.30 to 0.42&nbsp;in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8&nbsp;mm (0.38 to 0.46&nbsp;in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0&nbsp;mm (0.35 to 0.39&nbsp;in).<ref>Bates et al., 2006, table&nbsp;1</ref>

In the skull, there is a well-defined lowered area in the middle of the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped [[nasal aperture]] (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the [[incisor]]s. The [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones) are slender. The [[supraorbital ridge]]s (located above the eyes) are well-developed.<ref name=Bea304/> ''P.&nbsp;abramus'', ''P.&nbsp;endoi'', and ''P.&nbsp;paterculus'' have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges.<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;307, 309</ref> The [[braincase]] is of average size and bears a poorly developed [[sagittal crest]] on its roof. The [[supraoccipital]], the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave [[palate]] are about parallel. The second upper incisor (I2<U+2014>there is no first upper incisor) has a well-developed second cusp in addition to the main cusp and I3 about reaches the height of the second cusp of I2.<ref name=Bea304/> The stout upper [[canine (tooth)|canine]] bears a single cusp. The second upper [[premolar]] (P2<U+2014>P1 and P3 are missing) is prominent and is displaced slightly towards the inner side of the toothrow. P4 does not contact the canine. The first and second upper [[molar (tooth)|molar]] (M1 and M2) are about equally large, but M3 is smaller. Each of lower incisors (three on each side) bears three cusps and the third (i3) may touch the lower canine (c1). The latter tooth has a second cusp, which reaches higher than i3. The second lower premolar (p2<U+2014>p1 and p3 are missing) touches the back of c1 and is as large as to smaller than p4. The first two lower molars (m1 and m2) have the back group of cusps ([[talonid]]) larger than the front one ([[trigonid]]), and m3 is again smaller.<ref name=Bea305>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;305</ref>

==Distribution, ecology, and behavior==
''Pipistrellus raceyi'' is known from four places on Madagascar, all below 80&nbsp;m (260&nbsp;ft) above sea level, of which two are on the west and two on the east coast.<ref name=Bea309/> Among the eastern collection sites, [[Kianjavato]] is a rural town surrounded by farmland and secondary forests, where ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' were collected while leaving a hollow in the concrete wall of a house and in a [[mistnet]] over a river,<ref>Bates et al., 2006, pp.&nbsp;309, 311; Goodman, 2007, p.&nbsp;14</ref> and [[Tampolo]] is in a heavily disturbed agriculturally used area. Both western localities, [[Kirindy]] and [[Mikea]], are in dry forest. In Kirindy, the pipistrelle ''[[Hypsugo anchietae]]'' has also been recorded. The true distribution of ''P.&nbsp;raceyi'' is probably larger than that currently known. There is very limited data on reproduction. Young are probably born near the start of the rainy season, in November<U+2013>December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be [[polygynous]], with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.<ref name=Bea311>Bates et al., 2006, p.&nbsp;311</ref>
==Conservation status==
The [[IUCN Red List]] currently assesses ''Pipistrellus raceyi'' as "[[Data Deficient]]" because of insufficient knowledge about its abundance and habitat requirements. All four known sites are near forest, but that may be a sampling artifact. Although deforestation may pose a threat, each of the collection sites has some sort of forest protection measures in place.<ref name=iucn/>
