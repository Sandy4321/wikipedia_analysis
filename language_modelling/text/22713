'''Wilfred James Skinner''', [[Pingat Pentadbiran Awam|PPA]] (31 May 1934 <U+2013> 2 August 2003) was a dual international who represented Singapore in [[Association football|football]] and [[Field hockey|hockey]].

Skinner was best known as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for the [[Singapore national football team]]. At club level, he also played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] in addition to his goalkeeping duties for Police Sports Association. He won the 1954 [[Singapore Amateur Football Association|SAFA]] Challenge Cup with his first club, Rovers Sports Club, and the 1969 President's Cup with Police. Skinner also represented the [[Singapore Lions|Singapore state team]] which participated in Malayan competitions and was part of the [[Malaya Cup]] winning teams of 1960, 1964 and 1965. He is widely considered as one of the best goalkeepers to play for Singapore. In a list of ''Singapore's 50 Greatest Athletes of the Century'' by ''[[The Straits Times]]'' in 1999, he was ranked 32nd and was the only goalkeeper in the list.

Skinner also represented Police and the Singapore state team in hockey. He won the 1957 Oehlers Cup and the 1958 Singapore Hockey Association Division One title with Police. At state level, he established himself as centre-half for Singapore and was national team skipper in the early 1960s and at the [[Field hockey at the 1962 Asian Games|1962 Asian Games]]. Skinner won the Razak Cup, the Malayan inter-state competition, with Singapore in 1965.

Skinner joined the [[Singapore Police Force|Police Force]] after leaving school and rose to the rank of [[Assistant Superintendent]].

In 2003, he had a [[heart attack]] and entered into a coma for two weeks. He passed away at the age of 69 on 2 August 2003.
