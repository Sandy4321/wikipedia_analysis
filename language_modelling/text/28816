'''Barbara Dana Broccoli''' (born [[June 18]], [[1960]]) is the daughter of the famous [[James Bond]] producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]]. She majored in motion picture and television communications at [[Loyola Marymount University]] prior to working in the casting and production departments at [[EON Productions]], the production company responsible for the official James Bond series of films dating back to 1962. Currently she co-produces Bond films with her half brother [[Michael G. Wilson]]. She is married to producer [[Frederick Zollo]] and they own an independent production company called [[Astoria Productions]]. She is the youngest of four children raised by Cubby and Dana Broccoli, the Half-sister of Michael G. Wilson (mother Dana, born: 1943), and Tina Banta (mother Nedra Clark-Broccoli, born: 1958) and Tony Broccoli (adopted by Cubby and Nedra Clark-Broccoli, ca. 1956-57).

==James Bond franchise==
Broccoli started in the Bond franchise at the age of 22 as an [[assistant director]] on ''[[Octopussy]]'' in 1983. Soon after she had worked her way up further to become an [[associate producer]] on the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' in 1987. However, her most notable role was being a producer of the Bond films starring [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Daniel Craig]].

Following a suggestion that the new [[M (James Bond)|M]] for ''[[GoldenEye]]'' should be a woman, Broccoli cast [[Judi Dench]]. This arguably risky move has proved very successful, giving the 007-M relationship new depth. In 1995's ''[[GoldenEye]]'', Dench's character tells Bond, "I think you're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur. A relic of the [[Cold War]]."

==''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang''==
Following her father's death in 1996, Broccoli created the stage musical version of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' based on the 1968 [[musical film]] starring [[Dick Van Dyke]] and [[Sally Ann Howes]]. Broccoli rehired the original songwriters from the film to write the new material for the stage version. The [[Sherman Brothers]] wrote six new songs for the show which debuted on [[April 16]], [[2002]]. The show ran at [[London]]'s largest free house, the [[London Palladium]] and was the most financially successful show to have ever played there, breaking numerous other impressive records as well. ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' went on to play successfully in both the [[United States]] and throughout the [[United Kingdom]].
