'''"Angry Andy"''' is the twenty-first episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 8)|eighth season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. It was written by [[Justin Spitzer]] and directed by Claire Scanlon. The episode aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on April 19, 2012. "Angry Andy" guest stars [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] as Ravi: [[Pam Halpert|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Jim Halpert]]'s ([[John Krasinski]]) pediatrician and a potential love interest for [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]).

The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns to the office to find [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) in the manager's chair. After throwing an extreme tantrum and punching a hole in the wall, Andy is fired. Meanwhile, Kelly is forced to choose between [[Ryan Howard]] ([[B.J. Novak]]) and a new man, Ravi.

According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], "Angry Andy" was viewed by an estimated 4.35 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, making it, at the time, the lowest-rated episode of ''The Office'' to air. The episode ranked second in its timeslot and was also the highest-rated NBC series of the night.

==Plot==
[[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) returns to Dunder Mifflin to find [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her authority when she orders [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have performance difficulties with [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]). Erin asks [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) if he had similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. When he tells Nellie that she affected Andy's performance abilities, she feels guilty about taking his manhood. She holds a meeting where the office workers share advice on how to perform sexually. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally [[The Return (The Office)|punching his hand through the wall]]. When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying "no" too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.

Meanwhile, [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) is forced to choose between [[Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) and a new man, Ravi ([[Sendhil Ramamurthy]]). [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) set up Kelly and Ravi in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several attempts to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can't even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she's not going to be with him. Pam eventually says that he's not a nice person, and [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem.  Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.

===Reviews===
{{double image|left|MindyKaling08.jpg|160|Bjnovak crop.jpg|140|The subplot involving [[Mindy Kaling]] ''(left)'' and [[B.J. Novak]] ''(right)'' received particularly positive reviews from critics.}}
Critical reception to the episode was largely mixed. Myles McNutt of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the entry a "C" and thoroughly criticized Nellie's "hostile takeover" of the Scranton branch, calling it "utterly ridiculous".<ref name=avclub/> McNutt also called most of the humorous moments in the episode "too familiar", noting that Andy's punching of a wall had already been performed in the [[The Office (U.S. season 3)|third season]] episode "[[The Return (The Office)|The Return]]".<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title='Angry Andy' {{!}}The Office {{!}} TV Club {{!}} TV|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/angry-andy,72213/|work=[[The A.V.

M.

He criticized the plot invoking Nellie taking the manager position away, as well as Erin's outburst, saying it "it was warranted but disingenuous".<ref name=whatculture>{{cite web|last=Kratzer|first=Joseph|title=TV Review: The Office 8.21, <U+201C>Angry Andy<U+201D>|url=http://whatculture.com/tv/tv-review-the-office-8-21-angry-andy.php|publisher=WhatCulture!|accessdate=3 September 2012|date=20 April 2012}}</ref> Not all reviews were so critical. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half-stars out of five and noted that the return of Andy's anger issues was a "pleasant change of pace".<ref name=tvfan/> He concluded that it include several scenes of physical comedy and was "certainly an improvement on last week's episode ['[[Welcome Party]]']".<ref name=tvfan>{{cite web|last=Forcella|first=Dan|title=The Office Review: Just Say No|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2012/04/the-office-review-just-say-no/|publisher=TV Fanatic|accessdate=3 September 2012|date=20 April 2012}}</ref> Screencrave reviewer Jeffrey Hyatt awarded the episode a seven out ten but noted that Andy's return and his meltdown "didn't wow me", but that his increased ego was impressive.<ref name=screen>{{cite web|last=Hyatt|first=Jeffrey|title=The Office: Season 8 Episode 21: Angry Andy <U+2013> TV Review|url=http://screencrave.com/2012-04-19/the-office-season-8-episode-21-angry-andy-tv-review/|publisher=Screencrave|accessdate=3 September 2012|date=19 April 2012}}</ref>

Critical reception to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan was largely positive. McNutt called Novak's acting "some of [his] best work in a long time".<ref name=avclub/> He called the plots conclusion "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well".<ref name=avclub/> White wrote that "If it weren't for [Kelly and Ravi's] story [<U+2026>] I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely."<ref name=ign/> Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending due to its ending "ended in boos and hisses".<ref name=tvfan/> However, he was confused with the casting, noting that "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? [<U+2026>] He seems more like someone you bring in for a multi-episode arc."<ref name=tvfan/> Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote "the Ryan-Kelly stuff I give a 10/10."<ref name=screen/>
