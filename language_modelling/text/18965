{{nihongo|'''''Minoo'''''|<U+7B95><U+9762>|Min<U+014D>}} was a [[minelayer]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], which was in service during the final stages of [[World War II]]. She was named after a waterfall near [[Minoh, Osaka|Minoh]], a small city in [[Osaka Prefecture]]. She was the [[lead ship]] of what was intended to be a two-vessel class, but her [[sister ship]], designated ''Vessel #1822'' was not completed before the end of the war.

==Building ==
During the very final stages of World War II, in preparation for the anticipated [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]  [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese home islands]], the Imperial Japanese Navy perceived the need to block the entrances to the [[Sea of Japan]], namely the [[La P<U+00E9>rouse Strait]], [[Tsugaru Strait]] and [[Tsushima Strait]] to protect Japan<U+2019>s long and relatively lightly defended western coastline.<ref>{{cite book |title=Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire |last=Frank |first=Richard B. |authorlink=Richard B. Frank |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=067941424X }} </ref> However, as all [[minelayer]]s has been sunk by that time, an emergency program was begun under the [[Wartime Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1944)|''Maru Sen'' Programme]] to construct several small vessels for this task. ''Minoo'' was a modified Type 2D wartime standard cargo ship, which had been laid down by the [[Naniwa Dock Company]] on November 29, 1944. It was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Navy in December before completion, was launched on May 13, 1945, and was commissioned into service on August 5, 1945 after modifications at the [[Kure Naval Arsenal]]. <ref>{{cite web| last = Nishida| first = Hiroshi| url = http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0862.htm | title = Materials of IJN| work = Imperial Japanese Navy| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Operational history==
On completion, ''Minoo'' was assigned to the [[Kure Naval District]], but the [[surrender of Japan]] occurred only 5 days after her commissioning. She was removed from the [[navy list]] on October 5, 1945.
From September 1945 through December 1946, ''Minoo'' was used as a repatriation transport, shuttling between [[Okinawa]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hakata, Fukuoka|Hakata]], and [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] returning demobilized Japanese troops and civilians from the Asian mainland to the [[Japanese home islands]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/Minoo_t.htm | title=  IJN ''Minoo'': Tabular Record of Movement | last= Nevitt | first=  Allyn D. | year= 1999|month= | work= Long Lancers | publisher= Combinedfleet.com}}</ref> She was scrapped in 1947.
