==Defendants==
The Case of Military was a [[secret trial]], unlike the [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trials]]. It is traditionally considered one of the key trials of the [[Great Purge]]. Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] and the senior military officers [[Iona Yakir]], [[Ieronim Uborevich]], [[Robert Eideman]], [[August Kork]], [[Vitovt Putna]], [[Boris Feldman]] and [[Vitaly Primakov]] (as well as [[Yakov Gamarnik]], who committed suicide before the investigations began)  were accused of [[anti-Soviet]] conspiracy and sentenced to death; they were executed on the night of June 11&ndash;12, 1937, immediately after the verdict delivered by a Special Session (<U+0441><U+043F><U+0435><U+0446><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0441><U+0443><U+0434><U+0435><U+0431><U+043D><U+043E><U+0435> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0441><U+0443><U+0442><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+0435>) of the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. The Tribunal was presided over by [[Vasili Ulrikh]] and included marshals [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Semyon Budyonny]] and Army Commanders [[Yakov Alksnis]], [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], [[Ivan Belov]], [[Pavel Dybenko]], and [[Nikolai Kashirin]]. Only Ulrikh, Budyonny and Shaposhnikov would survive the [[purge]]s that followed.

The trial triggered a massive subsequent purge of the [[Red Army]]. In September 1938 the People's Commissar for Defense, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], reported that a total of 37,761 officers and [[commissar]]s were dismissed from the army, 10,868 were arrested and 7,211 were condemned for anti-Soviet crimes.

==Background==
The trial was preceded by several purges of the Red Army. In the mid-1920s, [[Leon Trotsky]] was removed as Commissar of War, and his known supporters were expunged from the military. Former [[tsar]]ist officers had been purged in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  The latter purge was accompanied by the "exposure" of the "Former Officers Plot".  The next wave of arrests of military commanders started in the second half of 1936 and increased in scope after the February<U+2013>March 1937 Plenary Meeting of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), at which [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] called for more thorough exposure of "[[Wrecking (Soviet crime)|wreckers]]" within the Red Army, since they "had already been found in all segments of the [[Soviet economy]]".

==Evidence, arrest, and secret trial==
General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] was arrested on May 22, 1937 and charged, along with seven other Red Army commanders, with the creation of a "right-wing-[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]" military conspiracy and [[espionage]] for [[Nazi Germany]], based on confessions obtained from a number of other arrested officers.

Before 1990, it was frequently argued that the case against the eight generals was based on forged documents created by the [[Abwehr]], documents which deluded Stalin into believing that a plot was being fomented by Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders to depose him. However, after Soviet archives were opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, it became clear that Stalin actually concocted the fictitious plot by the most famous and important of his Soviet generals in order to get rid of them in a believable manner.<ref>Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene<U+0161> in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), ISBN 0-19-510267-3, ISBN 978-0-19-510267-3, p. 95</ref>  At Stalin's order, the [[NKVD]] instructed one of its agents, [[Nikolai Skoblin]], to pass to [[Reinhard Heydrich]], chief of the German Nazi SD (''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'') intelligence arm, concocted information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin.<ref>Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene<U+0161> in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), ISBN 0-19-510267-3, ISBN 978-0-19-510267-3, p. 95</ref>  Seeing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Union and his arch-enemy [[Admiral Canaris]] of the German [[Abwehr]], Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it, forging a series of documents implicating Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders; these were later passed to the Soviets via Bene<U+0161> and other neutral parties.  [[Joseph Stalin]]'s archives indeed contain a number of messages received during 1920&ndash;30s duly reporting the possible involvement of Tukhachevsky with the "German Nazi leadership".
 
While the Germans believed they had successfully deluded Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality they had merely served as useful and unwitting pawns of Stalin.  It is notable that the forged documents were not even used by Soviet military prosecutors against the generals in their secret trial, instead relying on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants.<ref>Lukes, Igor, ''Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene<U+0161> in the 1930s'', Oxford University Press (1996), ISBN 0-19-510267-3, ISBN 978-0-19-510267-3, p. 95</ref>

Afraid of the consequences of trying popular generals and war heroes in a public forum, Stalin ordered the trial also be kept secret, and that the defendants be executed immediately following their court-martial.<ref>Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G. P. Putnam (1945), pp. 5, 7-8</ref>  Tukhachevsky and his fellow defendants were probably tortured into confessions.<ref>Rayfield, Donald: ''Stalin and his hangmen: the tyrant and those who killed for him'' (New York: Random House, 2004), page 324</ref>
 
All convicts were [[rehabilitate (Soviet)|rehabilitate]]d on January 31, 1957 citing "absence of essence of an  offence". It was concluded that arrests, investigations and trials were performed in violation of procedural norms and based on [[forced confession]]s, in many cases obtained with the aid of physical violence.

==Unresolved issues==
===Reasons and motives===
There are no conclusive facts about the real rationale behind the forged trial.  Over the years, researchers and historians put forth the following hypotheses.

The central hypothesis, and the one with the widest support, is that Stalin had simply decided to consolidate his power by eliminating any and all potential political or military rivals.  Viewed from the broader context of the Great Terror which followed, the execution of the most popular and well-regarded generals in the [[Red Army]] command can be seen as a preemptive move by Stalin and [[Nikolai Yezhov]], People's Commissar of State Security, to eliminate a potential rival and source of opposition to their planned purge of the [[nomenklatura]]. The fall of the first eight generals was swiftly followed by the arrest of most of the People's Commissars, nearly all regional party secretaries, hundreds of Central Committee members and candidates, and thousands of lesser CPSU officials.  At the end, three of five Soviet Marshals, 90% of all Red Army generals, 80% of Red Army colonels, and 30,000 officers of lesser rank had been purged.  Virtually all were executed.<ref>Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 322</ref> 

At first it was thought 25-50% of Red Army officers were purged, it is now known to be 3.7-7.7%. Previously, the size of the Red Army officer corps was underestimated and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. 30% of officers purged 1937-9 were allowed back.<ref>Stephen Lee, European Dictatorships 1918-1945, page 56</ref>

Another suggestion is that Tukhachevsky and others did indeed try to conspire against Stalin.  [[Leon Trotsky]] in his later works argued that while it was impossible to speak conclusively about the plot, he saw indications in Stalin's mania for involvement in every detail of Red Army organization and logistics that the military had real reasons for dissent, motives which may have eventually led to a plot.  However, the revelations of Stalin's actions following the release of Soviet archival information have now largely discredited this theory.  While the military may well have had many secret reasons for their dislike of Stalin, there is now no credible evidence that any of them ever conspired to eliminate him.

===Speedy inquest===
[[Vadim Rogovin]]'s book ''1937: Stalin's Year of Terror''  contains a lengthy discussion of another unexplained mystery: it took only about two weeks to force [[admission (law)|admission of guilt]] from the accused, despite the fact that all of them, were relatively young, able-bodied military trained people. Rogovin contrasts it with the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]], where the inquest lasted about 4 years, despite brutal tortures.  One possible explanation is that the Soviet commanders, after a life of military service, could not stand up psychologically to the position of opposing their commander-in-chief.  Another is that the men may have been tricked into signing confessions in the belief that their lives or those of their families would be spared, a tactic sometimes employed by Stalin.
