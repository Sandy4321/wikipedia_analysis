'''''The Last Spire''''' is the tenth studio album by the British [[doom metal]] band [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]]; it was released in April 2013.<ref>[http://thequietus.com/articles/06289-cathedral-lee-dorrian-interview Lee Dorrian Discusses the End of Cathedral] thequietus.com. 2011-05-19.

==Overview==
Cathedral had announced well prior to the release of ''The Last Spire'' that this would be their last album.  [[Lee Dorrian]] described the band's planned retirement as a "funeral" for the band, which was a "long and gratifying process".<ref name=m-r>{{cite web|first=EvilG|title=IN MEMORIAM: CATHEDRAL 1990-2013|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2013/02/26/cathedral-the-last-spire/|work=[http://www.metal-rules.com Metal-Rules]|accessdate=11 May 2013|date=26 February 2013}}</ref> For Dorrian, the announcement enabled the band to record the album without pressure, "as it meant that we no longer had anything to prove and could make this album purely on our own terms".<ref name=m-r />

''The Last Spire'' featured a slower, doom-oriented sound akin to the band's debut, ''[[Forest of Equilibrium]]''.  Dorrian explained that the return to Cathedral's roots for its final album was not only intentional, but even resulted in the band omitting any track that did not fit with the goal of creating an "unhappy ending":

{{bq|1=This [''The Last Spire''] is the album I've been waiting to do since the first one, it almost feels like we made our second album last in some respects. We actually recorded a lot more material but decided to sacrifice many of the tracks to make the overall album feel more complete in its nihilism. I don<U+2019>t like happy endings, I never have.<ref name=m-r />}}

Ultimately, Dorrian acknowledged his comfort with letting ''The Last Spire'' stand as Cathedral's legacy.<ref name=m-r />

==Reception==
The album has been well-received by critics.  Most reviews focus on the return to a doom-oriented sound and a reduction in the "quirky touches" that Cathedral demonstrated on albums such as [[The Ethereal Mirror]] and, most recently, [[The Guessing Game]].  Chris Ward described the album as bringing Cathedral "full circle", and serving as a bookend to the band's debut; however, he also observed "enough of the flavours the band sprinkled into all their albums in between to give it the feel of a eulogy of the band<U+2019>s output."<ref name=tinas />  Dean Brown, describing ''The Last Spire'' as a "true doom record", also credited the band with a "masterful understanding of dynamics" that includes the Cathedral's "signature curveballs".<ref name=scratch />  Natalie Zed, while criticizing the middle of the album as unwieldy, also praised the band for integrating "their musical demise into their very aesthetic, and were able to create a final album that does justice to their respected career".<ref name=about.com />
