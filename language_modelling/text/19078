The '''''Mississippi'' class battleships''', {{USS|Mississippi|BB-23|6}} and {{USS|Idaho|BB-24|6}}, served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1908 to 1914. This was the last pre-dreadnought U.S. battleship class to be designed, and for reasons of economy and compromise, these ships were considered inferior in many aspects to the preceding design class.  Because the last ship of the prior design, the [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]] was authorized and completed after these ships, that ship was the last U.S. pre-dreadnought to be built.<ref name="Friedman p44">Friedman 1989 p. 44</ref>

These ships were the result of a compromise between factions advocating technologically advanced battleships and those preferring more but less expensive battleships.  These ships were a step-down in size, armament, speed, and seaworthiness from the prior classes.  However, the next design, the [[South Carolina class battleship|''South Carolina'' class]], was a completely different approach with all big guns and returned to the displacement of the [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]].  The ''South Carolina'' class would be similar in concept to the {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, and in some ways superior; they had superior range, and were able to achieve the same broadside and protection on a smaller displacement.

As US naval strategy and expectations developed further, and subsequent designs grew larger and faster, these ''Mississippi'' class ships became undesirable, and within six years of completion, they were sold to the Greek Navy, with which they served until they were both sunk during [[World War II]].

==Purpose==
In the early twentieth century, the U.S. navy was growing rapidly. The U.S. Navy commissioned its first battleships in 1895,<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 424</ref> but by the middle of the next decade Jane's Fighting Ships ranked its battle-line second only to the British Navy.<ref>Rose pp. 12-14</ref>  However, this rapid growth was not universally supported either within the government or within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary in order to get funding.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>

The Mississippi class ships were designed to meet Congressional and Navy Department objectives of reducing the escalating cost of new battleships, the quantity, size, and cost of which had increased dramatically over the first two decades of U.S. battleship production.
<ref group=Note>Preliminary plans for the first two U.S. battleships were completed in 1885, construction was approved in 1886, and the first keel was laid down in 1888.  However, technical difficulties particularly with armor delayed completion and neither was commissioned until 1895. By the time these were completed they were obsolete as newer larger designs were being commissioned. (Friedman 1989 pp. 17-21)</ref>  There was a division among US naval planners in the early years of the 20th Century, over whether to have technically superior ships or many less expensive ones, with [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] among those supporting the former and [[Thomas Dewey|Admiral Thomas Dewey]] along with [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan]] supporting the latter approach.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>
[[File:Great White Fleet.jpg|thumb||The [[Great White Fleet]] demonstrated America's new naval strength by sailing around the world.  Most of these ships were under 10 years old, but were already obsolete.]]
The 1903 naval budget affected a compromise allowing production of both individual superiority and quantity.  The allocation called for five ships: three more ships of the 16,000 ton ''Connecticut'' class and two ships of a new less expensive class of approximately 13,000 tons, with the design to be determined.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>

The ships that became the ''Mississippi'' class were intended to serve as the modern equivalent of 19th century [[third-rate]] [[ship of the line]], offering what was thought to be an efficient compromise between sailing ability (speed, handling), fire power, and cost.<ref name="Reilly p187">Reilly p. 187</ref>   This concept had formed the backbone of the sailing battle fleets of the previous century, but trends in early twentieth Century naval strategies were making the [[third-rate]] concept obsolete.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>  Prevailing strategies called for a consistent battle line of [[first-rate]] units.<ref name="Reilly p187"/>

==Design==
While [[United States Congress|Congress]] had authorized three vessels in the 13,000 ton range, for the 1903 naval budget, the design was not specified.  Three approaches were initially considered: (1) a scaled down version of the preceding 16,000 ton [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]], five of which had been approved with the 1902 and 1903 budgets, (2) a scaled-up version of the 12,500 ton [[Maine class battleship|''Maine'' class]], an 1898 design, three of which were commissioned from 1902 to 1904, and (3) a fully new design which might incorporate new ideas and technology. Interesting adaptations were considered for new designs,<ref group=Note>The chief constructor considered two radical options: (1) combine battleship armor and secondary batteries but reduce the size of the four guns in the primary battery to 10 inch guns, similar to a large armored cruiser such as the [[USS Tennessee (ACR-10)|USS Tennessee]].  Or (2) reduce the size of guns in the main battery to 10 inches, but increase the number to twelve guns, and eliminate the 8&nbsp;inch and 7&nbsp;inch secondary batteries (all big gun). Either of these options would have saved weight and allowed for larger engines to increase speed.(Friedman 1989 p. 45)</ref>
and weight saving technology could allow increased efficiencies to be achieved from the older Maine class design,
<ref group=Note>Scaling up from the [[USS Maine (BB-10)|Maine]] would have included replacing the 6&nbsp;inch rapid fire guns in casemates, with 7&nbsp;inch rapid fire gins in the same mountings.   Hull depth would have increased to accommodate the 7&nbsp;inch guns, and armor would have been increased to standards consistent with the Connecticut class, including the use of lighter Krupp armor and superior coverage. (Friedman 1989 p. 45)</ref>
which was closest to the weight goal.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>

As with most US naval designs coal storage and engine efficiency were more important than in European designs.   US ships might have to fight far from US shores, especially in the Pacific.<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 5</ref>  Even in the Caribbean, US forces might be farther from their coaling stations, than a European power with colonial bases.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>  Draught was a concern, since southern US harbors tended to have shallow entrances, and some proponents felt that all ships should be able to egress all major harbors.<ref name="Friedman p20">Friedman 1989 p. 20</ref>  Beams were typically limited by the width of US dry-docks.<ref name="Friedman p20"/>

===Armament===
[[File:Mississippi - 12 inch Guns - 1908.jpg|thumb|''USS Mississippi'' - {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} main battery.]]
In 1903, there were differing concepts of the ultimate combination of guns, many ideas were based on various experiences and interpretations from recent naval battles.  The quality of guns, armor, ordnance, and design was changing rapidly, so experience could become irrelevant quickly.  Combat experience in the Spanish American War had shown the value of many smaller guns in close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate.<ref group=Note>In July 1898, based on analysis of naval battles during the Spanish American War,  a U.S. Navy Board released the following conclusions:  <U+201C>loaded torpedoes above the water-line are a serious menace to the vessels carrying them...<U+201D> and <U+201C>The value of rapid fire (Also known as: quick fire or QF) batteries cannot be too highly estimated.<U+201D>  As a result the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns which had been very efficient in the battle of Santiago were reintroduced in the <U+2018><U+2019>Virginia<U+2019><U+2019> class.  Above water torpedo tubes were discontinued on U.S. battleships and those on existing ships were removed.(Hovgaard. p 106)</ref>  However, in the [[Russo-Japanese War|Russo Japanese War of 1904<U+2013>1905]], just six-years later, decisive effects were obtained at long ranges, well beyond the limits of {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} ordnance.<ref name="Friedman p44"/>   But by this point, the designs were established for the ''Mississippi'' class, and keels had already been laid down.<ref name="DANF-M">US Navy Department, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/mississippi-ii.htm ''USS Mississippi'']</ref><ref name="DANF-I">US Navy Department, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/idaho-ii.htm ''USS Idaho'']</ref>

====Main batteries====
Recent US designs had clung to the concept of mounting the largest practical primary batteries of either {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} or {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} guns,  along with several intermediate {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns for faster-fire in close-combat with armored vessels.  The lighter guns were considered valuable for penetrating upper level armor, where the heavy guns were more effective on the main belt and heavy turrets.  The former was likely to dimish the fighting ability of the opponent, where the latter was more likely to sink her.<ref>Friedman 1989 pp.44 & 53</ref>

Earlier US battleships had used {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} guns with black powder propellant; however the 1898 design of the ''Maine'' class had shifted to more powerful but smaller {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns using smokeless powder, giving a greater velocity and flatter trajectory .<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 38</ref>  The {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} rifles available in 1904 had a range of 9,000 yards, about double the range of the black powder main armament used in the Spanaish American War.<ref>Alden p. 211</ref>  These were considered an excellent compromise of weight and firepower since limitations in gunnery-control made longer range guns impractical.<ref name="Friedman2008 p176">Friedman 2008 p. 176</ref>  The contemporary consideration was not whether to go larger, but whether to go with more. <ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 42 - 60</ref>   However, in 1902 naval officers, with the backing of President Theodore Roosevelt, began to develop superior fire-control techniques and equipment.  Better spotting and range finders began to improve range capacity and accuracy.<ref name="Friedman2008 p176">Friedman 2008 p. 176</ref>  At the same time, superior training and systems significantly reduced the time to load and fire the large guns from about every three minutes to every minute.<ref name="Friedman p43">Friedman 1989 p. 43</ref>

Intermediate {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns had been discontinued in the ''Illinois'' class, but based on experience in the Spanish American War, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber guns were included in the ''Virginia'' class and continued in the ''Connecticut'' class.<ref name="Hovgaard p104-109">Hovgaard pp. 104-109</ref>  Typically these were carried in 2-gun turrets, but the placement of the turrets had been inconsistent in prior designs; in two prior designs the turrets for the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns were superimposed over the turrets for the {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns (see ''[[Kearsarge class battleship|Kearsarge]]'' and ''[[Virginia class battleship|Virginia]]'' classes)<ref>Reilly pp. 140 - 141</ref>.  Some designers felt that {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns were redundant to the faster firing {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber guns carried in casemates.<ref>Reilly p. 162 - 163</ref>  Others argued that increases in the rate-of-fire and accuracy of the {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns eliminated the need for any smaller guns in the main battery.<ref name="Friedman p44">Friedman 1989 p. 44</ref>

====Secondary batteries====
Secondary batteries were considered "torpedo defense;" which meant defense against smaller boats armed with torpedoes, such as torpedo boats or destroyers.  Recently U.S. warhips had mounted a combination of a few {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} or {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, and many smaller guns in the {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} to {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} range (6 pounder to 12 pounder in the traditional terms).  The larger guns were typically protected in casemates and the smaller ones open on the deck or in lightly protected casemates.

A fast-firing {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber gun had been adopted with the previous battleship class, to replace earlier {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns;<ref name="Friedman p43">Friedman 1989 p. 43</ref> these brought significant improvement in ballistics, expanding the potential beyond torpedo defense, but came with drawbacks.  There were various opinions on the best combination of guns: all {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, all  {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}}, or a mix of {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}.
<ref group=Note>The Board on Construction, in planning for the ''Connecticut'' class favored a ship on which {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns would all be replaced by newly designed {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, which were the most powerful guns with shells that could be handled by one person. The {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns fired a much heavier shell than {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns of earlier classes, but were faster-firing than the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns.  The shell for the {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns weighed {{convert|165|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, whereas a shell for the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} gun weighed about {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and the shell for the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} gun weighed about {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. These {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=on}} shells could only be moved by "power or several men", making the {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} "the largest [gun] capable of really rapid fire in the context of existing technology".  However, in the end, only the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns were replaced and the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} batteries remained.  The {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}}guns could be fired six-times per minute, but the {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} required separate powder bags and could only be fired four-times per minute. Despite the improved ballistic performance over the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} there was a conflict with the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns by confusing gunners who were trying to adjust their ranges. The splashes of the {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns could not be distinguished at a distance.  This confused the gunners who would watch the splashes to gauge accuracy while trying to adjust their fire. The uniform intermediate battery proposed by the Board on Construction could have been more practical.(Friedman. 1989 pp. 44 - 45 & 55)</ref>  Though considered to be quick firing, the propellant for {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns.<ref name="Friedman p43">Friedman 1989 p. 43</ref>  The Navy considered these to be excellent in the intended role; however, in WW I North Atlantic convoy duty, the disadvantages in sea keeeping outweighed the utility; these were removed from battleships remaining in U.S. service in 1918.<ref>U.S. Navy Department. Bureau of Ordnance pp. 203 - 205)</ref>

Beginning with the [[Maine class battleship|Maine class]] vessels, commissioned in 1902, the {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} 50&nbsp;caliber gun (12-pounder) was used on most U.S. battleships as an anti torpedo boat weapon.   This role was filled back to the earliest U.S. battleships, including the Texas and first Maine, by the 6&nbsp;pounder {{convert|2.24|in|mm|adj=on}}).<ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 424 - 430</ref>  Ironically, most {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} guns were removed from U.S. battleships, before combat operations in World War I. <ref group=Note>During World War I there was a desperate need to arm merchant ships; the 3-inch 50-caliber guns were useful in that role.  On 3 March 1917 the removal of 38 such guns from battleships and cruisers was authorized, and the removal of 304 more was authorized on 26-28 April 1917.  It was determined that the removal of these guns allowed for the sealing of dangerous openings, for a gain in military efficiency. (U.S. Navy Department. Bureau of Ordnance pp. 41 - 42)</ref>

====Competing designs====
The future of battleship weaponry was at a crossroads.  There were varied opinions among top naval leaders; some U.S. naval leaders were discussing the all-big-gun concept in parallel with the British {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6|}}, while other designers felt that the torpedo would completely replace the gun and battleships should become heavily armored launch platforms.<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 143</ref>  Other proposals included even more but smaller primary guns, in the {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} size for weight savings.  In 1903, analysis of war games had determined that one battleship with twelve {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} or {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, in a hexagonal turret placement, could be superior to three conventional battleships in individual actions <ref group=Note>The June 1902 issue of ''Proceedings of the US Naval Institute'' contained comments by the U.S. Navy's leading gunnery expert Prof. P.R Alger proposing a main battery of eight {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}  guns in twin turrets.  In May 1902, the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] submitted a design for the battleship with twelve {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on}}guns in twin turrets, two at the ends and four in the wings. Lt. Cdr.  H. C. Poundstone submitted a paper to [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] in December 1902 arguing the case for larger battleships. In an appendix to his paper, Poundstone suggested a greater number of {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns was preferable to a smaller number of {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}}.  The [[Naval War College]] and Bureau of Construction and Repair developed these ideas in studies between 1903 and 1905. War game studies begun in July 1903 "showed that a battleship armed with twelve {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} or {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns hexagonally arranged would be equal to three or more of the conventional type."(Friedman 1989 pp. 52-53)</ref><ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 52 - 53</ref>   Other analysis suggested that in fleet actions, only broadsides were effective, thus maximizing the number of centerline guns was the most efficient approach.<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 54</ref>   While niether approach was incorporated in the ''Mississippi'' class, centerline maximum broadside concept was followed in all subsequent US battleship designs.<ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 51 - 65</ref>

[[File:Casemate.png|thumb|A casemate mounting of a secondary gun on an early 20th Century U.S. battleship.]]

====Final design====
In the end, these ships were built with the identical main batteries as the ''Connecticut'' class, while reducing by four guns the {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} battery, omitting eight of the {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, and sacrificing two torpedo tubes.<ref>Reilly p. 191</ref>  Ironically, subsequent designs would eliminate the {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} batteries completely, and most of the {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} guns were removed from other battleships before combat in WW I, so in respect the design did not suffer by comparing forward.<ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 51 - 65</ref>

The main battery consisted of four {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber guns, meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter.  These were considered quick-firing guns and were arranged in two twin-[[Gun turret|turrets]], one forward and one to the rear of the main superstructure. There were eight {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber guns arranged in four twin-turrets outboard of the main superstructure on each side of the ship. <ref>Reilly pp. 106 - 203</ref>  

The remaining eight {{convert|7|in|mm|adj=on}} 45 caliber guns were distributed four per side, in casemates on the side of the ship, below the main-deck.<ref group=Note>Casemates are similar to turrets, but in the case of U.S. capital ships, there is only one gun per casemate. In [[naval gunnery]] a [[Casemates|casemate]] is a vertical armor plate with openings for guns. It is less protected than a [[gun turret]] and allows for a smaller field of fire. It is however much cheaper in terms of money and far lighter in weight for a given level of armor protection.  In late 19th and early 20th century [[battleship]]s, casemates were used to mount secondary guns for defending the ship against [[torpedo boat]]s.  In practice, these guns were generally quite useless; usually mounted close to the water, casemate guns were often awash in spray, and sometimes swamped completely by the ship's rolling. More modern designs did away with casemate weapons entirely, favoring extra topside mounts for their secondary batteries. (Hovgaard. p.104-109)</ref><ref name="Hovgaard p104-109">Hovgaard pp. 104-109</ref>  Four {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} 50 caliber guns were mounted in the upper casemates (main-deck), two per side, behind {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on}} of armor plate.<ref>Reilly pp. 165 - 167</ref>  Another two, one per side, were mounted in blister casemates on the gun deck, near the bow.<ref>Reilly pp. 164 - 165</ref> The remaining eight guns were on open mounts on the upper deck, bridge and other deck spaces.<ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 42 - 47</ref>  Two submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the broadside.<ref name="Hovgaard p104-109">Hovgaard pp. 104-109</ref>

===Armor===
[[File:Mississippi Armor.png|thumb|left|Simplified drawing of armor scheme for early 20th Century U.S. battleships.]]
Prior to the mid 1870s armor was made of wrought iron plate, sometime backed with wood.  In the 1870s compound armor was developed, where a hardened steel face was cemented to a softer iron backing, which prevented cracking. During the late 1880s nickel-steel armor was devised and in 1890 the [[Harvey armor|Harvey process]] was developed,<ref>Rose p. 11</ref> where a nickel-steel plate was treated with carbon and hardened in cold water.  This process allowed one homogeneous steel plate to have both a hard surface and a softer back which was less likely to crack.   During the 1890s [[Krupp armor]] further refined the process by including additional metals in the alloy and developing a system where the hardening process penetrated more deeply into the plates.  Test showed that {{convert|5.75|in|mm|adj=on}} of Krupp armor was equal to {{convert|7.75|in|mm|adj=on}} of Harvey armor, {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} of compound armor, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} of wrought iron plate, while in thinner plates Harvey armor was basically equal to Krupp.<ref name="Sondhaus 165-166">Sondhaus pp. 165-166</ref>

The Mississippi class ships used a combination of Harvey and Krupp style armor (American-made), consistent with other U.S. capital ships for the decade.<ref name="Sondhaus 165-166">Sondhaus pp. 165-166</ref>   The amount of armor and its strength was consistent with the preceding ''Connecticut'' class and in some cases was more complete in coverage and thicker, especially compared to the earliest ''Connecticuts''.  The belt armor was thinner, {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}} compared to {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} but longer, {{convert|244|ft|m|sp=us}} compared to {{convert|200|ft|m|sp=us}}, despite the ''Mississippi'' class being shorter, {{convert|382|ft|m|sp=us}} compared to {{convert|456|ft|m|sp=us}}.  The primary turret armor was thicker by an inch; {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} thick as opposed to {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} on the ''USS Connecticut'' <ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 430 - 431</ref>

===Machinery===
[[File:USS Wisconsin (BB-9) engines cropped.JPG|thumb|Typical triple expansion steam engine in a U.S. battleship.]]
When these ships were designed the older technology of reciprocating steam engines was slowly being replaced by the newer technology of steam turbine propulsion.   However, while turbines generally meant more speed, they also sacrificed efficiency and limited the range of the ships unless more fuel could be stored.   Early ''Dreadnought'' designs which were in simultaneous development with the ''Mississippi'' used primitive direct drive turbines.   The U.S. navy was slow to fully adopt turbines, and only used them exclusively in battleship production when indirect transmissions became refined ([[gear reduction]] or [[turbo-electric]]).<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 62</ref>  Several subsequent battleship classes were built where otherwise identical vessels had different types of engines(e.g. [[Delaware class battleship|''Delaware'' class]] and [[Nevada class battleship|''Nevada'' class]]).

[[Image:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb||The working of a triple-expansion steam engine. High-pressure steam is used three times to produce motive power, gradually cooling as it goes.]]
''Mississippi'' and ''Idaho'' were equipped with two-shaft vertical [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple expansion steam engines]], which drove two propellers. These were reciprocating engines, where the steam was used multiple times (triple expansion) for greater efficiency.  Steam was provided by eight [[Babcock and Wilcox]] boilers. Their engines were rated at {{convert|10000|ihp|link=on}}, which produced a top speed of {{convert|17|kn}}.<ref name=C1860/> On trials, however, ''Mississippi'' reached {{convert|13607|ihp|abbr=on}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|17.11|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=F431/>  In terms of speed this class of ships was inferior to several preceding classes, and was only slightly superior to the [[Illinois class battleship|''Illinois'' class]] which was laid down in 1896.<ref>Friedman 1989 pp. 427 - 431</ref>

The ships carried {{convert|600|LT|abbr=on}} of coal in purpose-designed coal bunkers, and up to another {{convert|1200|LT|abbr=on}} of coal could be stored in voids in the sides of the hull.<ref name=C1860/> This provided the ships with a range of {{convert|5800|nmi|link=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=F431/> The range was less than the previous class<ref>Hore p.95</ref>

===General characteristics===
[[File:Mississippi 2 Cages.jpg|thumb|USS ''Mississippi'' with second cage mast as installed.]]
The final design was a scaled down version of the preceding [[Connecticut class battleship|''Connecticut'' class]].  By comparison, these ships were to be a knot slower and have a lower [[Freeboard (nautical)|free board]], so they did not perform as well in heavy seas.<ref name="Reilly p197">Reilly p. 197</ref> The two ''Mississippi'' class ships were {{convert|382|ft|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]], had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|77|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}}. The ships were designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] 13,000 long tons (13,209 t) at normal displacement and up to {{convert|14465|LT|abbr=on}} at full combat load.<ref name=C1860>Gardiner & Chesneau p. 144</ref> The ships' crews numbered 34 officers and 710 enlisted men.<ref name=F431>Friedman 1989 p. 431</ref>

The World Cruise of 1907-1909 tested the sea keeping of the U.S. designs, and even the earlier designs, including the ''Connecticut'' class, with higher free board carried their secondary armament too close to the waterline.<ref name="Gardiner111">Gardiner & Gray p. 111</ref>
The ships initially carried a pole mast above the [[conning tower]], though shortly after commissioning the ships both had [[lattice mast]]s added aft. In 1910, the forward masts were replaced with lattice masts as well.<ref name=H63>Hore p. 63</ref>  After trials were successful with these ships, the ships returning from the World Cruise (Great White Fleet) were refitted with cage masts.<ref name="Gardiner111">Gardiner & Gray p. 111</ref>

===USS ''Mississippi'' (BB-23)===
[[File:USS Mississippi BB-23 construction.jpg|thumb|Under construction at the Cramp shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1907.]]
{{Main|USS Mississippi (BB-23)}}
The second ''Mississippi'' (Battleship No. 23) was laid down on 12 May 1904 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by the William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Co.  She was launched on 30 September 1905; sponsored by Miss Mabel Clare Money, daughter of Senator Hernando DeSoto Money of Mississippi; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, League Island, on 1 February 1908, with Capt. John C. Fremont in command.<ref name="DANF-M">US Navy Department, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/mississippi-ii.htm ''USS Mississippi'']</ref>

''Mississippi'' departed Philadelphia in February 1908 for Hampton Roads, and then sailed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Following her shakedown off the coast of Cuba in 1908, she returned to Philadelphia for final fitting out.  In early 1909 she attended the inauguration of the President of Cuba, met the Great White Fleet upon its return and was reviewed by the President.  For the remainder of the year and into 1910 she alternated between the waters off New England and southern waters, including the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, along with a voyage in the Mississippi River and war games out of Guantanamo Bay.<ref name="DANF-M" />

[[File:Mississippi - Airplanes.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''Mississippi'' Off Vera Cruz Mexico in 1914 with aircraft on board.]]
In late 1910 she sailed to  Gravesend Bay, England  and then to Brest, France, as part of Atlantic Fleet manoeuvres, returning to Guantanamo Bay in early 1911.  She then spent about 14 months  off the Atlantic coast, based alternately out of Philadelphia and Norfolk, serving as a training ship and conducting operational exercises.  In June 1912 she landed a Marine detachment at El Cuero, Cuba to protect American interests and remained on station in Guantanamo Bay until July, when she sailed for home.  Following exercises with Battleship Division 4 (BatDiv 4) off New England, she returned to Philadelphia Navy Yard where she was put in the First Reserve in August 1912.<ref name="DANF-M" />

''Mississippi'' remained in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia until detached December 1913 for duty as aeronautic station ship at Pensacola, Florida.  At Pensacola, she stood by while her crew, along with the early naval aviators, rebuilt the old naval base, laying the foundation for the Pensacola Naval Air Station.
With the outbreak of fighting in [[United States occupation of Veracruz|Mexico in April 1914]], ''Mississippi'' sailed to Veracruz, arriving with the first detachment of naval aviators to go into combat. Serving as a floating base for the fledgling seaplanes and their pilots, the warship launched nine reconnaissance flights over the area during a period of 18 days. One month later, the battleship departed Veracruz for Pensacola.<ref name="DANF-M" /> In June 1914 she returned to Hampton Roads where in July she was decommissioned and transferred to the Greek Navy.<ref name="DANF-M" />

===USS ''Idaho'' (BB-24)===
[[File:Iowa - consrtruction.jpg|thumb|USS ''Idaho'' under construction at Cramp yard, Philadelphia.]]
{{Main|USS Idaho (BB-24)}}
The second ''Idaho'' (Battleship No. 24) was laid down on 12 May 1904 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Co.; launched on 9 December 1905; sponsored by Miss Louise May Gooding, 13-year old daughter of Idaho Governor Frank R. Gooding; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, League Island, on 1 April 1908, with Captain Samuel W. B. Diehl in command.<ref name="DANF-I">US Navy Department, ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'' [http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/idaho-ii.htm ''USS Idaho'']</ref>

''Idaho'' departed Philadelphia in April 1908 for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, via Hampton Roads. Following a shakedown off the coast of Cuba in 1908, she returned to Philadelphia for final fitting out and repairs.  In the summer of 1908 she transported a detachment of marines to Colon in the Canal Zone to support a peaceful election process.<ref name="DANF-I">US Navy Department,''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships''[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/idaho-ii.htm ''USS Idaho'']</ref>

Following a period of repairs at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, ''Idaho'' steamed to Norfolk, where she received a new "cage" mainmast tower, conducted testing of her guns out of Hampton Roads and then returned to Philadelphia for more repairs and work.<ref name="DANF-I"/>
[[File:Iowa - 1 Cage.jpg|thumb|left|''USS Idaho'' With first cage mast as installed in 1908]]
In early 1909 she joined with ''USS Mississippi'' and other ships to meet the Great White Fleet upon its return and was reviewed by the President.  For the remainder of the year and into 1910 she alternated between the waters off New England and southern waters, including the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, along with a voyage in the Mississippi River and war games out of Guantanamo Bay.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

In late 1910 she sailed across the Atlantic with the Third Division of the Atlantic Fleet to Gravesend Bay, England and then to Brest, France, returning to Guantanamo Bay in early 1911.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

After routine service with the Atlantic Fleet and in Cuban waters, ''Idaho'' departed Philadelphia on 4 May 1911, bound for the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River visiting the Louisiana ports of New Orleans and Baton Rouge, steamed past the mouth of the Red River, then visited St. Joseph. She then called at Vicksburg and Natchez in late May before visiting a succession of Louisiana ports.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

From mid 1911 to early 1913 she again performed routine service and manoeuvre's with the Atlantic Fleet and in Cuban waters, with periodic visits to Philadelphia for repairs.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

In February 1913, unrest in Mexico led to a coup d'<U+00E9>tat and death of deposed President Francisco I. Madero. For the protection of American interests," ''Idaho'' deployed first to Tampico in May, then to Veracruz in June, but she rejoined the fleet in Newport in late June.  She then proceeded to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 27 October 1913.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

''Idaho'' remained in reserve until recommissioned at Philadelphia in March 1914.  At Annapolis, she embarked midshipmen  bound for the Mediterranean in company with USS Missouri and USS Illinois.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

After visiting Tangier, Gibraltar and Naples, USS Idaho arrived at the French port of [[Villefranche]], on 17 July 1914.  The midshipmen, were disembarked en masse to the ''USS Maine'', and ''Idaho'' was formally transferred to the Greek Navy on 30 July 1914.<ref name="DANF-I"/>

===Greek Service===
[[File:Lemnos in Greek Attire.jpg|thumb|''Limnos flying Greek flags]]
Diplomatic tensions between Greece and the [[Ottoman Empire]] following the 1912-13 [[Balkan Wars]] resulted in each seeking to buy powerful warships abroad that would enable them to control the Aegean Sea.  The ''Idaho'', and  ''Mississippi'', were sold to Fred J. Gauntlett, an intermediary, on 8 July 1914, who then sold them both to the Greek government.  The proceeds of the sale were used to increase the fiscal year 1915 budget, allowing a third [[New Mexico class battleship|''New Mexico'' class]] super-dreadnought, ''[[USS Idaho (BB-42)|''USS Idaho'']].<ref>Friedman 1989 p. 101</ref>

''Mississippi'' was renamed ''[[Greek battleship Kilkis|Kilkis]]'' for the crucial [[Battle of Kilkis-Lahanas|battle]] of the [[Second Balkan War]]. ''Idaho'' was renamed ''[[Greek battleship Limnos|Limnos]]'', in honor of a victorious naval battle over the [[Turkish Navy]] during the [[First Balkan War]].  Though their service was uneventful, these ships served to balance German capital ships which were acquired by rival Turkey.  The design limitations were not as critical in that strategic environment and the calmer seas of the Mediterranean. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Henry Morgenthau wrote, ""Those battleships immediately took their places as the most powerful vessels of the Greek Navy, and the enthusiasm of the Greeks in obtaining them was unbounded." .<ref name="DANF-M"/>

Both ships were seized by France along with the rest of the Greek Fleet in 1916 due to Greece's tentative neutrality in World War I .<ref group=Note>There was division in the Greek government which involved the disagreement between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over whether [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] should enter [[World War I]].  This became known as the "National Schism".  The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in Greece becoming divided in two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. (Bellou & Couloumbis p. 140)</ref> The ships had their breech blocks removed and ammunition unloaded; their crews were forcibly reduced to minimum levels.<ref>Gardiner & Gray p. 383</ref> When Greece entered the war on the side of the Entente, in 1917, France returned the ships to the Royal Hellenic Navy.<ref name="Paizis-Paradellis(2002)">Paizis-Paradellis p. 113</ref>  Subsequently, the Greek Navy took part in the Allied operations in the Aegean.<ref name="Paizis-Paradellis(2002)">Paizis-Paradellis p. 113</ref>

[[File:Iowa sunk with Miss in background.jpg|thumb|right|''Kilkis'' sunk in foreground with ''Limnos'' in background.]]
After World War I both ships saw action in 1919, when the Greek Navy took part in the Allied expedition in support of Denikin's White Armies in the Ukraine, and in the operations of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919<U+2013>1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in Asia Minor.  During the Allied Crimean expedition in support of White Russian forces, they were under the command of Rear Admiral G. Kakoulidis, RHN. During the Asia Minor Campaign, ''Limnos'' was the flagship to the Second Fleet, based in Smyrna, under Rear Admiral G. Kalamidas RHN; her mission was the surveillance of the Black Sea, Dardanelles and Asia Minor coasts.<ref name="Paizis-Paradellis(2002)"/>

===Fate===
Both ships were decommissioned in the mid 1930s.  ''Kilkis'' which had been upgraded in the mid 1920s became a naval artillery training facility.  ''Limnos'' guns were removed and were installed at a coastal defense battery on the island of [[Aegina]].<ref name="Paizis-Paradellis(2002)"/>

Both ships were sunk in Salamis Naval Base by Stuka dive bombers on April 23, 1941, during the German invasion of Greece. The ''Kilkis''was hit by bombs and went down in shallow water at her dock.  The ''Limnos'' was hit also, but able to get underway enough to be beached.<ref>Reilly p. 202</ref>

The wrecks were refloated and sold for scrap in the 1950s.<ref name="DANF-M"/>
