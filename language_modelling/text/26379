'''Hilda Rix Nicholas''' (n<U+00E9>e Rix, later '''Hilda Rix Wright''', 1 September 1884&nbsp;<U+2013> 3 August 1961){{#tag:ref|Though born Emily Hilda Rix, neither published sources nor family correspondence normally use her first given name. The Australian Dictionary of Biography lists her as Emily Hilda Nicholas,<ref name=ADBRix/> despite the fact that no other source used that combination of names, nor did the artist herself.|group=notes}} was an Australian artist. Born in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] city of [[Ballarat]], her father was an education administrator and poet, while her mother was a musician and artist. Rix Nicholas studied under leading member of the [[Heidelberg School]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] from 1902 to 1905. Following the death of her father in 1907, Rix Nicholas, together with her only sibling Elsie and their mother, travelled to Europe where she undertook further study in London and then in Paris. Her teachers during the period included [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]], [[Richard Emil Miller]] and [[Th<U+00E9>ophile Steinlen]].

After travelling to [[Tangiers]] in 1912, Rix Nicholas held several successful exhibitions of her work, with one drawing, ''Grande marche, Tanger'', purchased by the French government. One of the first Australians to paint [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] landscapes, she was made a member of the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Peintres Orientalistes Fran<U+00E7>ais]], and had works hung in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of [[World War I]]; a period of tragedy ensued, as Rix Nicholas's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married Major George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the [[Western Front]].

Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas returned to professional painting after a hiatus, and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at in Melbourne's [[Storey Hall|Guild Hall]]. Many works sold, including ''In Picardy'', purchased by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]. Peers such as [[Julian Ashton]], [[Antonio Dattilo Rubbo]] and [[Grace Cossington Smith]] reviewed her work favourably. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe, where she both displayed her recent Australian works and painted new pieces, particularly of the people of [[Brittany]]. A 1925 exhibition led to the sale of her work ''In Australia'' to the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Luxembourg]], and an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. There followed representation in other exhibitions, including at the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers]], and the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], both in London. Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation.

In 1926, Rix Nicholas returned to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, whom she had met during her travels in the early 1920s, and the couple settled at [[Delegate, New South Wales]]. They had their only child, a son named Rix Wright, in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including ''The Summer House'' and ''The Fair Musterer'', Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful of the works of emerging major artists such as [[Russell Drysdale]] and [[William Dobell]], grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], [[Australian War Memorial]], [[National Gallery of Australia]], National Gallery of Victoria, and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]].

==Early life==
Henry Finch Rix and Elizabeth Sutton, each of whom had migrated to Australia as children with their families, met and married in Victoria in 1876. They had two daughters, Elsie Bertha, born in 1877, and Emily Hilda (known ubiquitously just as Hilda), born in [[Ballarat]] on 1 September 1884.<ref name=Blue>{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=231480|last=Rix Nicholas|first= Hilda| title=The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains|year=purchased 2013|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref>{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=3<U+2013>4}} The Rix children grew up in a gifted and energetic family. Henry was a mathematics teacher, appointed a district Inspector of Schools in the 1880s, and a poet who wrote in support of [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation]]. He also played [[Australian Rules Football]] for the [[Carlton Football Club]].{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=11}}{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=4}} Elizabeth had grown up assisting in her parents' thriving music business in Ballarat, and was a singer who performed with the Ballarat Harmonic Society.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=4}} In addition, she was an artist who had a studio in Melbourne's [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders Street]]; "she was also a committee member of the Austral Salon, a meeting place for intellectual women interested in the fine arts."{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=11}} She painted in an [[academic painting|academic style]], generally choosing [[still life]]s and flowers as subjects, though she also painted some large landscapes in the [[Beechworth]] region.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=4<U+2013>5}}

[[File:Frederick McCubbin - Self-portrait, 1886.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Frederick McCubbin, leading member of the [[Heidelberg School]] and Rix Nicholas's first major influence]]
Hilda Rix Nicholas and her sister Elsie both played musical instruments as children, and would perform songs or dances at regional shows.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|11}} Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters collaborated in designing posters to advertise the Salon's activities.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=5<U+2013>6}} As a child, Hilda was enthusiastic at drawing portraits and figures.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=11}} Attending high school at [[Melbourne Girls Grammar]] (known as Merton Hall),<ref name="ADBRix">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Avenel|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra|year=1988|volume=11|chapter=Nicholas, Emily Hilda (1884<U+2013>1961)|isbn=978-0-522-84380-4|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/nicholas-emily-hilda-7837|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref> her art drew praise, though in many other respects she was not an outstanding student. Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda went on to study at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the [[Heidelberg School]], [[Frederick McCubbin]]. Her fellow students were mostly women and included [[Jessie Traill]], [[Norah Gurdon]], [[Ruth Sutherland]], [[Dora Wilson]], and [[Vida Lahey]].{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=6}} Rix Nicholas would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as "vague persuasions". Nevertheless, art historian and biographer John Pigot considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of [[nationalism|nationalistic ideas]] and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=7}}

Drawings undertaken by Rix Nicholas while still a student were included in annual exhibitions at the Victorian Artists' Society and the Austral Salon. At the same time, she was working as a professional illustrator for textbooks and a periodical, the ''School Paper'', published by the Victorian Department of Education.{{sfn|Pigot|20000|p=7}} In 1903, all of the Rix family women had works included in the Austral Salon's exhibition.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=18}}

One of Rix Nicholas' early sketchbooks survives and pages from it were reproduced in the 2012 book, ''In Search of Beauty''. Although Rix Nicholas described the works as her "very earliest drawings when a child in Melbourne", the dated pages indicate they were created up until at least the age of twenty. They mostly portray women, and the settings and dress of her subjects reflect the relatively affluent and educated milieu of which the Rix family were part.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=37}}

In this period, it was common for aspiring Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there in conjunction with a trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=21}}{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=8}} But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and the trip threatened never to eventuate. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out whether and how to get to Europe.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=127}} Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=127}}{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=12}}

==Europe 1907 <U+2013> 1912==
[[File:Tom Roberts - Smike Streeton, 1891.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Arthur Streeton, as painted by [[Tom Roberts]]. Rix Nicholas followed his advice to study under many different teachers.]] 
Just before her departure from Australia, Rix Nicholas was advised by the painter [[Arthur Streeton]] to study with many different masters, as a means of preserving her own originality. Her subsequent career reflected that advice.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=21}} One of her first teachers was [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]], although he had initially protested that she was already a better drawer than himself. Rix Nicholas thought him "simply great", and Pigot credits Hassall's simple and direct style with influencing Rix Nicholas's later practice.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=10}}

Late in 1907, Rix Nicholas moved to Paris. There she met with Australian artist [[Emanuel Phillips Fox]], went on sketching expeditions to the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] where [[Ethel Carrick Fox]] also worked, and became a student at the Acad<U+00E9>mie Delecluse, operated by academic painter Auguste Delecluse.{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=130}}{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=12}} The following year she was taught by American impressionist [[Richard Emil Miller]]. From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour pallette, not always naturalistic, as well as his "agile brushwork"; she did not, however, follow his predilection for pretty compositions, favouring more direct and clear images.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=14}} Continuing to acquire skills from a wide range of artists, she next studied at the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie de la Grande Chaumi<U+00E8>re]], including with Swiss-born illustrator [[Th<U+00E9>ophile Steinlen]].{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=16}} In the summers, Rix Nicholas, together with her sister and mother, would travel. In 1908 they journeyed through France and Italy, while in subsequent summers they spent time in the artist colony and fishing village of [[<U+00C9>taples]], in northern coastal France.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=17}}{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=33}}

Around 1909, Hilda met Wim Brat,{{#tag:ref|The name is given as Brat by de Vries,{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=133}} and Braat by Pigot.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=18}}|group=notes}} an architecture student from a wealthy Dutch family. He asked Hilda's mother for approval to marry her daughter, and Mrs Rix agreed. A happy engagement turned sour, however, when Rix Nicholas spent time at her fianc<U+00E9>'s home, where she found her prospective husband dominated by his mother, who strongly disapproved of the match. Rix Nicholas reluctantly broke off the engagement.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|de Vries|2011|pp=133<U+2013>134}}

Rix Nicholas continued to work hard, and she was rewarded with success in having work hung in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1911, alongside fellow Australians Arthur Streeton and [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15232844 |title=Australian artists abroad |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=2 May 1911 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Morroccan paintings 1912<U+2013>1914==
[[File:Hilda Rix Nicholas painting "Men in the Market Place".jpg|thumb|right|Detail of ''Men in the Market Place, Tangier'', showing a typical subject of Rix Nicholas's Moroccan work, and her post-impressionist style adopted during this period.]]
Rix Nicholas twice visited north Africa. She first joined American painter [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], his wife and a Miss Simpson on a trip to Morocco in January 1912. They travelled via Spain, where Rix Nicholas had the opportunity to view the work of [[Diego Vel<U+00E1>zquez|Vel<U+00E1>zquez]], whose compositions and palette she greatly admired.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=62}} The party's destination was Tangier, a place where many other artists had previously sought inspiration. [[Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant]] had lived and painted there in the 1870s, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[John Singer Sargent]] had visited in the 1880s,  while [[Henri Matisse]] was in Tangier at exactly the same time as Tanner and Rix Nicholas.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|pp=56, 63<U+2013>64}}

For about three months, Rix Nicholas sketched and painted in Tangier, spending time in the market place or ''soko'', and visiting [[T<U+00E9>touan]] where she may have joined a party that included Matisse.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|pp=99<U+2013>103}} Her enthusiasm for the place was evident from her correspondence:
<blockquote>Picture me in this market-place <U+2013> I spend nearly every day there for it fascinates me completely <U+2013> have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far <U+2013> Am feeling thoroughly at home now so am going to take out my big oil box <U+2013> wanted to get used to people and things first <U+2013> Oh how I do love it all!&nbsp;... Oh the sun is shining I must out to work.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=83}}</blockquote>

Morocco had a similar effect on Rix Nicholas as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that captured the intense north African light, and most  works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the non-European elements of the architecture.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=26}}
One interpretation of the perspective of Rix Nicholas is that she was an [[orientalism|orientalist]], in the sense used by academic [[Edward Said]]. However, Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=193}} and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting [[Essentialism|generalised views]] of the orient.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=4}} Her works also reflected the [[modernism|modernist]] interest in the empirical: in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=128}} Stylistically, Rix Nicholas's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the "most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career".{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=191}} She was one of the first Australians to paint [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]] landscapes, exemplified by ''View of Tangier'' (1914), produced at the time of a second visit to the city.

The 1912 trip represented a landmark in her work, led to several exhibitions and her first significant international critical acclaim. The journeys are also the subject of one of the few books about Rix Nicholas's work, Jeanette Hoorn's ''Hilda Rix Nicholas and Elsie Rix's Moroccan Idyll: Art and Orientalism''.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012}} Exhibition of her first works produced immediate results: the French government purchased one of her pictures of the market in Tangiers,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120675552 |title=Melbourne artist sells picture to French Government |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 <U+2013> 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=15 December 1912 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and in 1913 she again had paintings displayed at the Paris Salon.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50704040 |title=The Old Salon |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|Examiner (Launceston, Tas. : 1900 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Launceston, Tas. |date=30 April 1913 |accessdate=8 February 2014 |page=5 Edition: Daily |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The purchase by the French Government was of a pastel drawing, ''Grande marche, Tanger'',{{#tag:ref|Also referred to as ''A Tangier Market''.

The drawing was favourably discussed in the French edition of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', but not by one ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reviewer, who complained that "the drawing and colour are eccentric, after the post-impressionist manner" and described the central figure as "grotesque in its want of finish".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15844541 |title=Women painters |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=8 November 1919 |accessdate=10 February 2014 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=85}}

The ''Herald's'' reviewer was, however, at odds with prevailing sentiment. Her success was widely reported in Australian papers such as the ''Herald'', Hobart's ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Mercury]]'', Melbourne's ''[[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]]'' and Adelaide's ''[[South Australian Register|Register]]''.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=3}} In addition to displaying the results of her trip at the Salon, she was invited to exhibit in a 1913 collection of paintings displayed by the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Peintres Orientalistes Fran<U+00E7>ais]], also in Paris. Rix Nicholas was also made a member of the society.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|pp=104<U+2013>106}} In November 1912, there was a solo exhibition at a private gallery, Galerie J Chaine and Simonson. Her work was illustrated in the ''Notre Gazette'', reflecting her emerging status as a significant artist of the period,{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=88}} and the French press reported her exhibitions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Les Orientalistes|date=8 February 1913|work=Journal des d<U+00E9>bats politiques et litt<U+00E9>raires |pages=3|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Exposition E.

She returned again in early 1914, this time with her sister Elsie, who also did some drawing and writing but whose main purpose was to provide her sister with company, assistance and protection from curious onlookers while she painted.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|pp=115, 149}} Rix Nicholas painted regularly at the ''soko'' or open-air market, where she would both attract much attention and sometimes disrupt the flow of traffic as sought to sketch the subjects she found.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|pp=131<U+2013>141}} The sisters returned to England and then to France, where Rix Nicholas again spent the summer at  <U+00C9>taples, until the outbreak of [[World War I]] resulted in evacuation to London in August.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=187}}

==Disaster 1914<U+2013>1918==
The retreat to London marked the beginning of a tragedy-filled period in the life of the artist. Rix Nicholas's mother Elizabeth, who had been unwell, deteriorated during the crossing from France to England, and had to be transferred to hospital when they landed. She partially recovered and was transferred to a nursing home, however at that same time her other daughter, Elsie, fell ill.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=27}}

[[File:Hilda_Rix_Nicholas_drawing_"Desolation".jpg|thumb|right|A charcoal study for Rix Nicholas's painting ''Desolation'', created following the death of husband on the [[Western Front]]]]
Rix Nicholas shuttled back and forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix Nicholas withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued and Rix Nicholas cared for her only surviving parent, her artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth passed away.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=28}} Rix Nicholas was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: "I could scarcely put one foot in front of the other and walked like an old thing".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=28}}

Further misfortune lay in store. In France, an Australian officer, Major George Matson Nicholas, was posted to  <U+00C9>taples. There he heard about the Australian woman artist who had had to leave her paintings behind when she and her family left abruptly for England. Nicholas sought out the works and admired them, and decided to contact the artist when next he was on leave. He met Rix Nicholas in September 1916, and they were married on 7 October at St Saviour's, Warwick Avenue in London. After three days together, he returned to duty; she was widowed five weeks later on 14 November, when he was shot and killed during battle at [[Flers, Somme|Flers]], on the [[Western Front]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/hilda-rix-nicholas/biography/?|title=Hilda Rix Nicholas b. 1884 Ballarat, Victoria |last=Pigot|first=John|date=1995 (updated 2011)|work=Design and Art Australia Online|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=28<U+2013>29}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15699903 |title=Melbourne notes |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=20 December 1916 |accessdate=2 March 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Initially writing in her diary that she had lost the will to live, Rix Nicholas's grief eventually found its expression in three paintings, titled ''Desolation'', ''And Those Who Would Have Been Their Sons, They Gave Their Immortality'' (a phrase from a poem by [[Rupert Brooke]]), and ''Pro Humanitate''.  The first of the paintings (which was destroyed in 1930), portrayed a gaunt and tearful woman shrouded in a black cloak, crouched staring at the viewer amidst a battlescarred landscape, featureless but for the crosses on distant graves.

==Return to Australia, return to Europe 1918 <U+2013> 1928==
In March 1918, Rix Nicholas, along with her brother-in-law Athol Nicholas, left England and arrived in Melbourne on 10 May. There, with the encouragement of artist Henrietta Gulliver and the members of the city's Women's Art Club, Rix Nicholas began to reconstruct her career as a professional artist.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=33}} It did not take long. In November, she was amongst the members of the Club whose works were displayed at the Athaeneum Hall, where a critic described her as the "dominating personality of the show".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article138716209 |title=The Women's Art Club exhibition |newspaper=[[Melbourne Punch|Punch (Melbourne, Vic. : 1914 <U+2013> 1918)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=21 November 1918 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |page=37 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At the same time, in Melbourne's [[Storey Hall|Guild Hall]] she held a large exhibition of her European and north African paintings, sketches and drawings, with over a hundred works on display.

Rix Nicholas continued to experience success in her exhibitions and with regular favourable reviews in the press, such as for her show in the [[Queen Victoria Building|Queen Victoria Markets]] in September 1920.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16866268 |title=Mrs Rix Nicholas |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=16 September 1920 |accessdate=3 March 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Nevertheless, Pigot has argued that her place in the Australian art world at the time was complex, and her style affected by vigorous debate around the emergence of modernism, which was being resisted by local critics.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=37}} Her experience of this more conservative Australia, and the effects of the deaths of all her close family, contributed to Rix Nicholas abandoning her more experimental art, and returning to more academic and figurative subjects.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=196}} This did not at first cause any diminution in her reputation or success, but did alter the longer-term trajectory of her career, ultimately to her detriment. Pigot also argues that her refusal to conform to the gendered structure of Australian art led to her rejection by the artistic establishment.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=59, 70<U+2013>71}}

In 1922, a competition was launched by the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate Great War. Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry. Three judges, all respected Melbourne academic artists, submitted a report to the trustees, who met to consider the entries received. The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to [[Harold Septimus Power]], despite the fact that he had not fulfilled the conditions of entry; they then withheld the judges' report from publication, decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries, and delayed awarding any prize. One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Art historian and biographer John Pigot suggested that gender was a factor: "While Rix Nicholas's claim to be a war artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=39<U+2013>41}} Later that same year, the gendered nature of Australian war art was reflected in a decision by the [[Australian War Memorial]] to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman (titled ''A Mother of France'' (1914)), but not to acquire the other work offered, showing an Australian soldier (''A Man'' (1921)).{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp= 41<U+2013>42, Plates 6, 16}}

[[File:Hilda Rix Nicholas painting "In Australia".jpg|thumb|right|''In Australia'', painted by Rix Nicholas while staying at Delegate, New South Wales in 1922 or 1923.]]
Her paintings of war subjects were just one aspect of Rix Nicholas's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia in her paintings.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=42}} At the time of her 1919 exhibition, Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished "to show the people [of Europe] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme is so different, and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty".<ref name=virile/> In this respect she was following in the tradition of the [[Heidelberg School]] and writers such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Patterson]], who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life. Accompanied by her friend Dorothy Richmond, Rix Nicholas set out to paint in rural New South Wales, beginning in [[Delegate, New South Wales|Delegate]], a small town on the border of New South Wales and Victoria. Here she created numerous works, including ''In Australia'', ''His Land'', and ''The Shearers''.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=44}} Other works from this period include ''The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains'' (1921<U+2013>22), which is in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Australia]].<ref name=Blue/> While Australian patriotic imagery and discourse of the period was very male-dominated, Rix Nicholas's portraits of the period were frequently of women, such as in ''The Monaro Pioneer'', ''The Magpie's Song'' and ''Motherhood''.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=46, Plates 20<U+2013>22}}

Back in Sydney, Rix Nicholas held another solo exhibition in August 1923. Once again it was favourably reviewed, and there was again the description of her work in masculine terms: the reviewer at Sydney's ''Sunday Times'' described her as "the most virile, and, in many respects, the strongest woman painter Australia has yet produced".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120537175 |title=A Virile Woman Painter |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 <U+2013> 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=5 August 1923 |accessdate=5 March 2014 |page=21 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Rix Nicholas disliked being thought of as a "woman" artist, but she took such reviews as complementary, given how dismissive were critics in general when considering paintings by women.{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=145}}

In 1924, Rix Nicholas, again travelling with Dorothy Richmond, set sail for France, intending to exhibit her works in Europe. She voyaged on the ''Ormonde'', which was also carrying the Australian Olympic team. She befriended several of the team members and painted a portrait of one for an Olympic artists' competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article89379263 |title=Olympic honors|newspaper=[[Chronicle|Chronicle (Adelaide, SA : 1895 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=19 July 1924 |accessdate=5 March 2014 |page=46 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The result of this is not recorded.

Arriving in Paris in June, eventually Rix Nicholas found a studio in Montparnasse that had previously belonged to French artist [[Rosa Bonheur]].{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=49}} An exhibition at the "prestigious" Georges Petit Galerie in Paris in January 1925 was a great success. It led to important sales, including to the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Luxembourg]], making her the only Australian woman to have more than one work in its collection{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=50}} and, according to one report, one of only three Australian artists represented at all at that time, the others being [[Rupert Bunny]] and [[Arthur Streeton]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article130618767 |title=People Talked About.

[[File:Paris Musee Luxembourg facade.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Mus<U+00E9>e du Luxembourg]], which purchased works by Rix Nicholas.]]
The work purchased by the Luxembourg in 1925 was ''In Australia'', a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He was portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his teeth.{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=147}} Pigot described the painting:<blockquote>Silhouetted against a panoramic and golden landscape, the ruddy complexion, sinewy arms, pearly white teeth and jaunty bow tie suggest the health and vitality of country life as well as the individual confidence and self-assurance of the sitter. Casually holding the reins of his horse, the figure appears to be a ''Boys' Own Annual'' kind of hero, and reflects the optimistic outlook of the nation in the early 1920s".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=45}}</blockquote>

In 1925 there were further exhibitions, including at the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers]], and the Royal Academy of Art, both in London.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=76}} Also in London, a solo exhibition was held at the Beaux Arts Gallery in December, which displayed her painting ''His Land''. The work was described by one reviewer as having "the rare quality of conveying the spirit of life in the Commonwealth as well as portraying that life pictorially&nbsp;... the whole picture seems to convey the sunny heat-laden atmosphere of Australia".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article139867015 |title=Australian woman artist |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald|Newcastle Morning Herald & Miners' Advocate (NSW : 1876 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=5 December 1925 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>  Like ''In Australia'', this work also suggested "a kind of rugged earthiness and&nbsp;... sense of national vigour that Rix Nicholas believed was missing from contemporary artistic practice".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=44}}

Painted not with the artist's typical technique, but in a [[Mannerism|mannerist]] style, the subject faces the viewer yet is glancing away, her pose tense, expression unreadable, with a bunch of discarded flowers on the ground next to the hem of her enormous formal dress.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=55}}<ref name="Fleurs"/> Although portraying a young lady, the person chosen to sit was "a Parisian professional model and a prostitute, apparently with a reputation for being moody and cantankerous".<ref name="Fleurs"/> The pastiche created in this work is striking: a sixteenth century artistic style, a composition comprising a seventeenth century tapestry and an eighteenth century dress, created by a twentieth century artist. It certainly reflected the scope of Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, as she created a painting specifically with the intention of having it hung at the Paris Salon.<ref name="Fleurs"/> When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' critic's attention:
<blockquote> For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor<U+2014>those are excellent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16391358 |title=Mrs Rix Nicholas |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=4 June 1927 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref></blockquote>

While she exhibited many of the Australian works completed before arriving in France, she was also creating many new works, including illustrations and portraits of traditional life and costume, produced during a summer in [[Brittany]].{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=52<U+2013>55}} In 1926, Rix Nicholas was again included in London's Royal Academy of Art exhibition, where one of her Brittany paintings, ''Le Bigouden'', was hung.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=76}} She also appeared at the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] Spring exhibition in Paris,{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=74}} in which she had eight works, a very large number for a single artist.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128130053 |title=Australian art worthily represented in Parisian exhibitions |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 <U+2013> 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=13 June 1926 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> not only hung many of her paintings and drawings: she was also elected an Associate to the organisation in that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128130404 |title=Australians abroad |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sydney, Australia)|Sunday Times (Sydney, NSW : 1895 <U+2013> 1930)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=8 August 1926 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro plains]] to the south, up into central Queensland.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|pp=29<U+2013>30}}{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=152}}

==Wright and Knockalong, 1928 <U+2013> 1961==
Rix Nicholas had met the farming family, the Wrights, in the early 1920s, including Ned, the subject of ''In Australia''. After returning to the district, she married Edgar Wright on 2 June 1928 in Melbourne, and the couple settled on a property called Knockalong, near Delegate.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=60}} She continued to exhibit under the  name Rix Nicholas, though was also known as Rix Wright. Her friend Dorothy Richmond, with whom she had visited the region at the start of the decade, married Edgar Wright's cousin, Walter, and settled in the same region.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=30}} Then, in 1930, Rix Nicholas and her husband had their only child, a son, whom they named Rix.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=30}}{{#tag:ref|The Australian Dictionary of Biography entry on Rix Nicholas gives her son's name as Barrie Rix [Wright], while other sources refer only to Rix.<ref name="ADBRix"/>|group=notes}}

[[File:Hilda Rix Nicholas painting "The Summer House".jpg|thumb|right|''The Summer House'', painted circa 1933, is one of Rix Nicholas's best known works, but the artist herself was ambivalent about it and never showed it publicly.]]
While Australian artists embraced modernism and addressed the city, Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal. In France in the 1920s, Rix Nicholas had entertained [[Roy de Maistre]], one of the first Australians to experiment with [[abstractionism]], and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory';{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=50}} however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s, Rix Nicholas sided against it.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=66}}
There was in any case, as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, "no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s".{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=199}} Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits,{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=199}} while her approach to her subject matter became "more and more didactic".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=62}} Women were frequent subjects of her works, both as rural workers (as in ''The Fair Musterer'') and in domestic or family scenes (as in ''On The Hilltop''). Several images, such as ''On the Hilltop'' and ''Spring Afternoon, Knockalong'' portray women caring for a young son in a rural setting. Her most "stereotypically feminine" work was ''The Summer House'', which shows two of Rix Nicholas's friends with some freshly cut flowers, in a setting that, unlike most of her works of the period, screened out the surrounding landscape. It was a work about which Rix Nicholas was never convinced and which she never publicly displayed.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=62<U+2013>63}} Yet it has become one of her best known works, its easy acceptance consistent with the way reviewers in the 1930s pigeon-holed her work in terms of conventional gender roles.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=63<U+2013>64}}

Rix Nicholas had a number of exhibitions with some further critical success. Nevertheless, she became out of step with both the public, who bought few works at her last solo exhibition in 1947, and with some critics, who either rejected her work or criticised its lack of novelty. One critic, Adrian Lawler, observed:
<blockquote>Mrs Rix Nicholas is very gifted and she has her own individuality as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say&nbsp;... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=30}}</blockquote>
Another, considering a 1936 exhibition at the David Jones Gallery in Sydney, found the quality of her work uneven, and while he considered some to be strong, others were criticised as "nothing more than pretty and sentimental".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27990434 |title=Oil paintings |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=15 June 1936 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Pigot subsequently observed that "[t]he boldness of Rix Nicholas's imagery coupled with the didactic qualities of her new work were difficult for the contemporary press to accept at the end of World War II, and more importantly critics were all too conscious of the emptiness of the pastoral ideal".{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=71}} In 1945, The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' critic, lambasting Rix Nicholas's works as "crude in colour and poster-ish in presentation" concluded: "There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas... The bravura, the boldness of these pictures is hardly in keeping with the actual knowledge displayed. A certain humility, a close attention to the organisation of detail, and less white mixed into the colours would help tremendously."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17939186 |title=Woman painter's work |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=6 February 1945 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The antipathy between Rix Nicholas and prevailing trends in Australian art was mutual. She was appalled by the works of [[Russell Drysdale]] and [[William Dobell]], describing the figures in their paintings as "more like victims of the German prison camps" than representations of Australian people.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=67}} It seemed that the critics did not share her opinion: Dobell and Drysdale had each just won the [[Wynne Prize]] in successive years,<ref name="Wynnelist">{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/|title=Wynne Prize <U+2013> Explore past winners and finalists|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref> and both would soon represent their country at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/projects/venice-biennale/past-representation|title=Past Representation|work=Projects -> Venice Biennale|publisher=Australia Council for the Arts|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>

A final trip to Europe took place in 1950. She set out to show her husband the sights of a Europe she knew well, and to find a teacher of sculpture for their son Edgar. She was distressed by the standards of artistic practice she found, and instead discouraged Edgar from any career in the arts at all.{{sfn|Pigot|2000| pp=71<U+2013>72}}

Following her last solo exhibition, Rix Nicholas wrote to her son expressing despair in her artistic career and summarised the professional fate of her final years:
<blockquote>Not doing anything creative is nearly killing me. The trouble is that there is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not&nbsp;... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony&nbsp;... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=71}}</blockquote>
By this time, her health was deteriorating, and her passion for art fading.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=33}} Rix Nicholas did exhibit alongside her son in a group exhibition in Sydney, in 1954; she presented two oil paintings, while her son had the largest sculpture in the show, titled ''The Shearer''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18458007 |title=Mother and son exhibit country art |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=8 October 1954 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> She died in Delegate on 3 August 1961.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=33}}{{sfn|Pigot|2000|p=74}}

==Legacy==
Gender was a recurring theme in Rix Nicholas's career, for better and for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying "[mademoiselle] Rix paints like a man!".{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=125}} An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique "strangely unfeminine".{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=188}} When Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness to play by the male establishment's rules.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp=1<U+2013>2}}

Many of Rix Nicholas's works went into private collections for which records are limited. Many more were burned in a fire at the family property after her death in the 1960s.{{sfn|Hoorn|2012|p=192}} Though her fortunes declined in the latter part of her career, the twenty-first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output.{{sfn|de Vries|2011|p=155}} Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries, including the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.sa.gov.au/agsa/home/Collection/detail.jsp?ecatKey=6991|accessdate=14 March 2014|publisher=Art Gallery of South Australia|last=Rix Nicholas|first=Hilda|date=acquired 1996|title=Australian paintings: Monaro pioneer}}</ref> the [[National Gallery of Australia]], and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collection.qagoma.qld.gov.au/qag/imu.php?request=display&port=45001&id=b8ef&flag=ecatalogue&offset=1&count=default&view=details |accessdate=15 March 2014|publisher=Queensland Art Gallery|title=Collection search: The fair musterer 1935|last=Rix Nicholas|first=Hilda|date=purchased 1971 }}</ref> as well as in other collections including that of the Australian War Memorial.{{sfn|Pigot|2000|pp= 41<U+2013>42, Plates 6, 16}}

There have been several posthumous solo exhibitions of Rix Nicholas's works: in 1971 at the Joseph Brown Gallery in Melbourne (established by artist Joseph Brown, donor of the [[Joseph Brown Collection]]),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/joseph-brown-mentor-and-collector-who-made-a-difference/story-e6frg8ox-1225769309265|title=Joseph Brown: Mentor and collector who made a difference|last=Vaughan|first=Gerard|date=4 September 2009|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> followed by a travelling exhibition in 1978, displayed at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the [[Art Gallery of Ballarat]] and [[Macquarie Galleries]].
