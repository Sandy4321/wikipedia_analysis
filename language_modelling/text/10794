'''Lake City''' is the [[county seat]] of [[Columbia County, Florida|Columbia County]], {{GR|6}} [[Florida]], in the [[United States]]. In 2009, the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimated the city's population at 12,614.<ref name=censuspop/> In addition, it is the Principal City of the Lake City Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is composed of Columbia County, and had an estimated 2006 population of 67,007.<ref name=metropop>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.xls |title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-08-10|format=XLS}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The city's Sesquicentennial occurred in 2009.

==History==
The site of Lake City was a [[Seminole]] village named Alpata Telophka  or ''Hvlpvtv Tvlofv'', meaning "Alligator Village". By 1830, a Euro-American town called Alligator was established, adjacent to the Seminole town. The city was incorporated and changed to its current name in 1859. The name was changed because the mayor's wife, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator. Local bodies of water include Lake DeSoto, Lake Isabella, Alligator Lake, Lake Hamburg, Gwen Lake, Lake Harper and Watertown Lake.

The [[American Civil War]] [[Battle of Olustee]] took place near Lake City in February 1864. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. Union casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; Confederate casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing.

Southern Business & Development magazine has ranked Lake City | Columbia County number eight Best Small Market since 2000.

By the early 20th century, Lake City had become an important [[railroad]] junction, served by the Seaboard Air Line, Atlantic Coast Line, Georgia Southern Line, and the Florida Railroad Line.

One of the four schools that formed the University of Florida was originally located in Lake City before consolidation to Gainesville in 1905.  

By 1950 the population of Lake City was 7,467 people and forestry (turpentine, lumber, and pulpwood) had become a mainstay of the local economy.

In 1958, the Columbia Amateur Radio Society<ref>[http://nf4cq.com Columbia Amateur Radio Society] (http://nf4cq.com)</ref> was formed. This was a group of amateur radio operators that enjoyed the ability to communicate all over the world. Amateur radio is a hobby that attracts a wide range of people interested in all facets of radio communications. Involvement in amateur radio allows people to practice their public speaking skills as well as the advancement of one's knowledge of radio theory, electronics, and emergency management. This radio club still exists today.

Lake City's Centennial was celebrated in 1959 with parades, fireworks and a 58-page book documenting one hundred years of progress, <U+201C>A Century in the Sun<U+201D>. The citizens of the town dressed in period attire, complete with whiskers. A good-natured clash arose between the men with additional facial hair and the women who did not like it.<ref>[http://www.lakecityreporter.com/articles/2008/03/08/opinion/columns/morris_williams/doc47d363fc76d22046800596.txt Lake City Reporter: March 8, 2008-Lake City<U+2019>s 150th birthday <U+2014> time for a celebration by Morris Williams]</ref>

==Climate==

Lake City is part of the humid subtropical climate zone of the Southeast United States. Due to its latitude and relative position north of Florida's peninsula it is subject at times to continental conditions, which cause rare cold snaps that may affect sensitive winter crops.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Monthly Averages for | date=2011-10-12 | publisher= | url =http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/32056

==Economy==
Lake City and [[Columbia County, Florida]] are known as "The Gateway to Florida" because [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] runs though them, carrying a large percentage of [[Florida]]'s tourist and commercial traffic. Lake City is the northernmost sizable town/city in Florida on Interstate 75 and the location where I-10 and I-75 intersect. [[Interstate 10 in Florida|Interstate 10]] is the southernmost east-west major interstate highway and traverses the country from [[Jacksonville, Florida]] to [[Santa Monica, California]]. [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 90 in Florida|US 90]] (the US Highway versions of I-75 and I-10) have intersected in Lake City since 1927, long before the Interstate Highways were built. Interstate traffic also passed though Lake City during that time. The city relies on travelers for a considerable part of its economy.

Agricultural products of the area include [[tobacco]], [[maize|corn]], [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[melon]]s, [[timber]] and [[pulpwood]].

Lake City is the location of the [[Osceola National Forest]]'s administrative offices.

The [[Lake City Gateway Airport (Florida)|Lake City Gateway Airport]] is a local center of business. The airport is classified as a General Aviation facility, but two on-site operations are somewhat unique. [[TIMCO]] is an aircraft modification and rehabilitation operation for large (B-727, 737) civilian and military aircraft.
The [[United States Forest Service]] uses C-130 transport aircraft in support of its forest fire-fighting operations in the southeast US.

Since 2000, four companies have begun large operations in Lake City: Hunter Panels, New Millennium and United States Cold Storage.<ref>Hardison, Jeff M.: [http://www.lakecityreporter.com/articles/2008/10/31/news/doc490a8beea13ca112336295.txt] Lake City Reporter, October 31, 2008, "Tax breaks attract business"</ref>

===Alligator Festival - Alligator Warrior Festival - Reenactment of the Battle of San Felasco Hammock===
This festival at O'Leno State Park celebrates early 19th Century history, from 1800 to 1859, in north Florida, especially that of Alligator/Lake City and Newnansville/Alachua and is held each year on the weekend (Fri-Sun) of the 3rd Saturday in October.

Lake City's started out as the Seminole community of Alligator Village (Hvlpvtv Tvlofv) in Spanish Florida. Historians don't know when it was established but its existence is documented by the U.S. army in 1821. Spanish Florida had long been a place of freedom for slaves escaping from the Bristish colonies and the United States. Also, many of the refugees from the Creek War moved to Spanish Florida to live among or near the Seminole in the aftermath of the Creek War, because they had been forced to surrender their land to the U.S.A. in the Treaty of Fort Jackson. In a February 1821 report by Captain John H. Bell, he mentions that the recent death of the micco (chief) of Alligator Village prevented the micco's attendance at a gathering of chiefs. After Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to Alligator Village and called it Alligator Town. Then, following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own. When Columbia County was formed in 1832, Alligator Town became the seat of the county government. Alligator Town was renamed Lake City in 1859.

The most famous resident of Alligator Village was Alligator Warrior (Hvlpvtv Tvstvnvke). He was a son of a daughter of Micanopy (King) Payne (Mekk-Onvpv Pin) and lead Seminole warriors in the 2nd Seminole War (1835<U+2013>1842) to prevent the relocation of Florida's Indians to the Arkansas Territory (now known as Oklahoma). Although Alligator Warrior was certainly a leader of warriors, the U.S. military mistakenly referred to him as a chief because they did not understand Seminole culture. 

The Alligator Warrior Festival tries to educate and entertain by demonstrating how Native American, European, African and mixed-descent settlers lived in early 19th Century Florida. Living-history reenactors portraying 1830's Seminoles, U.S. soldiers, pioneer militia and settlers give presentations in their period camps and reenact the 18 September 1836, [[Battle of San Felasco Hammock]],<ref>[[s:Report of Colonel Warren, Fort Gilleland, September 18, 1836, to R. K. CALL, Governor of Florida]] Report of Colonel Warren regarding the Battle of San Felasco Hammock</ref> which is the 2nd Seminole War battle that took place closest to O'Leno State Park. The festival also includes Native American musicians and dancers, a drum arbor with dance ground and tee pee camp, as well as other musicians, demonstrators of early 19th Century skills such as blacksmithing, barrell making, spinning and weaving, and traders selling historic replicas, skillfully handcrafted arts, manufactured souvenirs, and food.<ref>[http://alligatorfest.org/] Alligator Festival web site</ref>

The first Alligator Festival was held in 1995 at Olustee Park in downtown Lake City. The event was not held from 2000 to 2001 while Olustee Park was being completely rebuilt. The renovated Olustee Park was no longer suitable for the event so it was held at Wilson Park from 2002 to 2003. Needing a larger space, it was held at Gateway College from 2003 to 2007. The organizational committee reorganized into a non-profit corporation in 2007. Then, for the city's sesquicentennial (150th) celebration in 2009, the event was held at the old memorial stadium because use of the college grounds became unaffordable. Starting in 2010 the annual festival is being held at O'Leno State Park, in Columbia County, where the appropriate facilities exist for a full scale battle reenactment, historic camping and large crowds.<ref>[http://alligatorfest.org/] Alligator Fest web site</ref>
