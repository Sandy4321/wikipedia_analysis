==Early life==
Reynolds' parents were Fern and Burton Reynolds, who was of half-[[Cherokee Indian]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878005-1,00.html|title=Grandmother-Cherokee|publisher=TIME Magazine (article from 1972)}}</ref> Reynolds states in his [[autobiography]] that his family was living in Lansing when Burt Senior was [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]].<ref name=birthplace>Severalsources list [[Waycross, Georgia]] as Reynold's birthplace ({{cite web|url=http://www.tcmdb.com/participant/participant.jsp?participantId=160584|25111&afiPersonalNameId=null|title=Birthplace|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}, {{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/hoekstra/240075,CST-FTR-rv02.article|title=Birthplace|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times (article from 2007)}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/509:127/1/Burt_Reynolds.htm|title=Birthplace|publisher=Biography Channel}}), for example, while other sources show that he was born in [[Lansing, Michigan]] ([http://www.burtreynolds.com/features.personal_faqs/ Burt Reynold's Official Website]), ([http://www.nndb.com/people/888/000023819/ NNBD] and [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-29786802.html The ''Palm Beach Post'', June 28, 2000]). Reynolds' autobiography (''My Life'') does not name his birthplace, although it does cover his childhood in Lansing, and fails to mention Waycross at all. For more discussion on Burt Reynolds' birthplace, see ([[Talk:Burt Reynolds|'discussion page]])</ref>  Burt Junior, his mother and his sister joined Burt Senior at [[Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri#Military base|Fort Leonard Wood]], where they lived for two years. Burt Junior has stated that his first memories are of playing in the [[Ozark]] woods at Fort Leonard Wood. When Burt Senior was sent to Europe, the family returned to [[Lansing, Michigan]]. After a short while, the Reynolds family moved to northern Michigan, across the road from his maternal grandparents' farm. Burt Junior started attending school in [[Merritt, Michigan]], where he felt he did not belong among the Native American, farm and backwoods children who made up most of the student body.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 5-12</ref>

Burt Senior was discharged from the Army in late 1945. In early 1946, while Burt Junior's parents were on a second honeymoon in [[Florida]], Burt Senior was offered a job as [[general contractor]] for a new housing development in [[Riviera Beach, Florida]]. Burt Junior moved to Riviera Beach with his parents, while his sister stayed in Michigan to finish the school year. The Reynolds at first lived in a [[mobile home]], but Burt Senior bought the first house that was completed in the new subdivision.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 14-7</ref>

Burt Junior thought he was in paradise. He had access to the [[Everglades]] to the west, the shore of the [[Lake Worth Lagoon]] to the east, and further east, across the Blue Heron Boulevard bridge to Singer Island, the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. He was fascinated by the [[Conch (people)|Conch]] fishermen and their families who made up most of the population of Riviera Beach.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 17-8</ref>

After two years Burt Senior's contractor job ended, and the Reynolds bought a lunch counter and sundry store next to the bridge to Singer Island. As the business was close to a large dock and some fish and shrimp packing houses, business was good. Soon after, Burt Senior was recruited as a police officer for Riviera Beach. When the police chief died a few years later, Burt Senior became the chief.<ref>Reynolds. Pp.18-9</ref>

As the Reynolds family home was at the north edge of Riviera Beach, Burt Junior attended school in [[Lake Park, Florida|Lake Park]], just to the north of Riviera Beach. While Burt Junior was in seventh grade, the [[Palm Beach County, Florida#Education|Palm Beach County School Board]] decided that there were too few seventh grade students in the school to justify a teacher's salary, and Burt was transferred to Central Junior High School (now [[Dreyfoos School of the Arts|Alexander W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts]])  in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]. Burt felt lost at the big school, and started hanging out with [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] and skipping school. He also began showing off with dangerous stunts, such as diving off the top of a raised [[drawbridge]], and jumping from an [[airboat]] onto the back of a running deer.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 17, 22-4</ref>

When Burt Junior was twelve he became friends with Jimmy Hooks. After learning that Jimmy was being physically abused in his home, Burt Junior took Jimmy home with him and told his parents he wanted Jimmy to be his brother. The Reynolds took Jimmy in. The Reynolds officially adopted Jimmy Hooks years later, when he was in his twenties.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 17, 27-8</ref>

When Burt Junior was fourteen he tried out for [[American football|football]] team at Central Junior High. He had never played organized sports, but worked hard at practice, earned his [[letterman]]'s sweater, and was named to the county [[All-star#Sports|all-star team]]. The next year, when Burt Junior entered high school, he made the [[varsity team]], but did not have much opportunity to play. In his [[junior year]] Reynolds had more opportunity to play. Seeing his ability, and foreseeing that he was likely to receive [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offers, one of Reynolds coaches persuaded him to take the courses necessary to enter a college. In his [[Twelfth grade|senior year]] Reynolds was named First Team All State and All [[Southeastern United States|Southern]] as a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], and received multiple scholarship offers.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 17, 33-7, 41-4</ref>

==College==
After graduating from [[Dreyfoos School of the Arts|Palm Beach High School]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], Reynolds attended [[Florida State University]] on a [[college football]] scholarship, becoming an all-star [[running back|halfback]]. While at Florida State, Reynolds joined the [[Phi Delta Theta]] Fraternity, the football team's fraternity of choice. He was anticipating a very good season his second year, with expectations of being named to All American teams, and an eventual career in professional football. In the first game of the season Reynolds tore the cartilage in his knee. He made the injury worse by trying to play again later in the game, and then again in a couple of games late in the season. On Christmas break that year, Reynolds ran his father's car up under a flatbed trailer that was sitting across a dark street. The car was wedged under the trailer, and it took rescuers seven and a half hours to remove Reynolds from the wreckage. He had multiple injuries, including his knee, shoulder, some broken ribs, and a ruptured [[spleen]], the last of which was removed in emergency surgery.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 49-56</ref>

With his college football career ended, Reynolds considered becoming a police officer, but his father suggested that he finish college and become a [[Probation officer|parole officer]]. In order to keep up with his studies he began taking classes at [[Palm Beach Community College|Palm Beach Junior College]] (PBJC) in neighboring [[Lake Park, Florida|Lake Park]]. In his first term at PBJC Reynolds was in a class taught by [[Watson B. Duncan III]]. Duncan pushed Reynolds into trying out for a play he was producing, ''[[Outward Bound (play)|Outward Bound]]''. He cast Reynolds in the lead, based on his impressions from listening to Reynolds read Shakespeare in class. Reynolds won the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance in ''Outward Bound''. Reynolds calls Duncan his [[mentor]] and the most-influential person in his life.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 57-9</ref>

==Career==
The Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a [[summer stock theater]], in [[Hyde Park, New York]]. Reynolds saw the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet see acting as a career. While working at Hyde Park Reynolds met [[Joanne Woodward]], who helped Reynolds find an agent, and be cast in ''[[Tea and Sympathy]]'' at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in [[New York City]]. Reynolds received favorable reviews for his performance in ''Tea and Sympathy''. Reynolds then went on tour with ''Tea and Sympathy'', driving the bus as well as appearing on stage.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 59-63.</ref>

After the tour Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes. His classmates included [[Frank Gifford]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Red Buttons]] and [[Jan Murray]]. After a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but he soon got a part in a revival of ''[[Mister Roberts]]'', with [[Charlton Heston]] as the star. After the play closed, the director, [[John Forsythe]], arranged a movie audition with [[Josh Logan]] for Reynolds. The movie was ''[[Sayonara]]'', and Reynolds was told he couldn't be in the movie because he looked too much like [[Marlon Brando]]. Logan advised Reynolds to go to [[Hollywood]], but Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 63-5.</ref>

Reynolds worked odd jobs while waiting for acting opportunities. He waited tables, washed dishes, drove a delivery truck and worked as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at the [[Roseland Ballroom]].  It was while working as a [[Stevedore|dockworker]] that Reynolds was offered $150 to jump through a glass window on a live television show.<ref>Reynolds. Pp. 65-7.</ref>

He made his Broadway debut in ''Look, We've Come Through''. Reynolds first starred on [[television]], in the 1950s series, ''[[Riverboat (television)|Riverboat]]'', and went on to appear in a number of other shows, including a role as [[blacksmith]] Quint Asper on ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' from [[1962]]-[[1965]].

His film debut was in 1961, in the movie ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]''. At the urging of friend [[Clint Eastwood]], Reynolds used his TV fame to secure leading roles in overseas low budget films, commonly called "[[Spaghetti Westerns]]". (Eastwood advised Reynolds from experience, as he had done the same). Reynolds first Spaghetti Western, ''[[Navajo Joe]]'', came out in 1966. These low budget starring roles established Reynolds as a bankable leading man in movies, and earned him starring roles in American big-budget motion pictures. His breakout performance in ''[[Deliverance]]'' in 1972 made him a star. The same year, Reynolds gained notoriety when he posed naked in the April (Vol. 172, No. 4) issue of ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]''.

Reynolds claims he was offered the role of [[James Bond]] by producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]], after [[Sean Connery]] left the franchise. Reynolds turned the role down, saying "An American can't play James Bond. It just can't be done."<ref>http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1038368.php</ref> In 1973, he released the album ''Ask Me What I Am''. He would also sing in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''. 

Reynolds appeared on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The American Sportsman]]'' hosted by outdoors [[journalist]] [[Grits Gresham]], who took celebrities on [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and [[shooting]] trips around the world.

On [[March 15]], [[1978]], Reynolds earned a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and in the same year built a [[dinner theatre]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]]. His celebrity was such that he drew not only big-name stars to appear in productions but sell-out audiences as well. He sold the venue in the early 1990s.  

In the 1980s, after ''Smokey and the Bandit'', he became [[typecast]] in similar, less well-done and less successful movies. Comedian and actor [[Robert Wuhl]], in a standup act in the late 80s, said that "Burt Reynolds makes so many bad movies, when someone else makes a bad movie Burt gets a ''royalty''!"  He had his hand at producing a television show with friend [[Bert Convy]] in 1987, ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]''. He even appeared as a celebrity gameplayer in a few episodes of the show.

During the first half of the 1990s, he was the star of the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Evening Shade]]'', for which he won an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (1991). Reynolds started a comeback with the movie ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]'' in 1996, and the critically acclaimed ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', in 1997, put his career back on track. He was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the movie. He was considered a front-runner for the Supporting Oscar, but ultimately lost to [[Robin Williams]], who won it for his role in ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.

In early 2000, he created and toured ''Burt Reynolds' One Man Show''. In 2002, he lent his voice to the character [[Avery Carrington]] in the controversial video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]''.

In 2005, he co-starred in two remakes: the first released was of  ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', this time with [[Adam Sandler]] playing the role of Paul Crewe, the role Reynolds had played in the 1974 original. This time around, Reynolds took on the role of Nate Scarborough. The second was of the hit 1980s TV series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', as [[Boss Hogg]].

He starred in the [[audio book]] version of ''[[The Worst Case Scenario Handbook]]''. In May 2006, Reynolds began appearing in [[Miller Lite]] beer commercials. In [[2007]] at the [[World Stuntman Awards]] he was awarded the Taurus Lifetime Achievement Award. While presenting him with the award [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] referred to him as the greatest of the great.

===Southern filmmaking===
Although Reynolds had already made eleven films, his performance as Lewis, the macho [[Atlanta]] businessman in the [[1972]] film adaptation of [[James Dickey]]'s novel ''[[Deliverance]]'', signaled the beginning of his box-office popularity. Hailed as one of the year's best films, ''Deliverance'' is the story of four suburbanites' harrowing journey into [[Appalachian]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Filmed on Georgia's [[Chattooga River]], ''Deliverance'' also marked the beginning of Reynolds's devotion to making films in and about the South. 

The following year Reynolds was persuaded to play the role of a [[moonshine]]r in the film ''[[White Lightning (1973 film)|White Lightning]]'' after the filmmakers promised to shoot in the [[Southern United States|South]]. ''White Lightning'', which was filmed in [[Arkansas]], broke attendance records nationwide, and the film's success encouraged [[Hollywood]] studios to make more southern films. In [[1976]] Reynolds both starred in and made his directorial debut with ''[[Gator (film)|Gator]]'', the sequel to ''White Lightning''. Deciding to shoot ''Gator'' entirely in Georgia, Reynolds announced that <U+201C>I have this violent urge to get behind the camera... I want to say some nice things about the South.<U+201D> 

In [[1974]] Reynolds starred in ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'', which was filmed at the [[Georgia State Prison]] in [[Reidsville]]. In the film Reynolds portrays a former athletic star forced to compete in a life-and-death [[American football|football game]]. Many inmates served as extras and helped to construct the sets, including a football field that was given to the prison after filming was complete. [[Jimmy Carter|Governor Jimmy Carter]] played a key role in the orchestration of the project and, according to Reynolds, promised that he "would personally come in and take me out if anything happened." The film, [[The Longest Yard (2005 film)|remade in 2005]] with Reynolds in the role of Coach Nate Scarborough was popular with audiences, but not with critics. 

During the next few years Reynolds continued his pattern of choosing southern-themed films that were often shot, at least partially, in the South. In the [[1975]] film ''[[W. W. and the Dixie Dance Kings]]'', filmed in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], he played the fast-talking, gas station robbing manager of a group of country musicians whose collective dream is to one day play the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Two years later, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', which also features the Georgia musician [[Jerry Reed]], was released and is one of Reynolds's best-known and loved films. Filmed entirely in Georgia, the successful comedy was followed in [[1980]] by ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]'', which was filmed partially in Georgia. 

Reynolds's next film, ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' [[1981]], was shot almost entirely in Georgia, referred to as "Burt's good luck state" by the director, [[Hal Needham]]. That same year Reynolds directed and starred in ''[[Sharky's Machine]]''. Filmed entirely in [[Atlanta]], the movie features Reynolds as a narcotics officer investigating the murder of a prostitute in the city. 

During these years, Reynolds starred in a number of other notable films, including ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'' [[1973]]; ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' [[1977]]; ''[[The End (film)|The End]]'' [[1978]], which he also directed; ''[[Starting Over]]'' [[1979]]; and ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' [[1982]], which was filmed mostly in [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.com/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1516&hl=y|title=Southern Filmmaking|publisher=The Georgia Encyclopedia}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
At various points in his life, Reynolds was romantically involved with [[Dinah Shore]], [[Sally Field]], and [[Chris Evert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:108069~T1|title=Chris|publisher=Allmovie.com}}</ref>  His relationship with Shore garnered particular attention given the fact she was 20 years his senior. Reynolds was married to actress/comedienne [[Judy Carne]] from 1963 to 1965, and actress [[Loni Anderson]] from 1988 to 1993, with whom he adopted a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds. ''[[E! Online]]'' reports that he dated [[Kate Edelman Johnson]] from 2003 to 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=bf6f466e-efbe-485b-86d1-b0dada8b06c1|title=Kate|publisher=E!}}</ref> 

His autobiography, titled ''My Life'', was published in 1994 with much writing help from his close personal friend, Al Glasgow.

===Sports team owner===
On July 3, 1982, Reynolds lived out one of his dreams by once again getting involved with a sport that still holds a certain soft spot in his heart, by becoming a co-owner of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], a professional football team in the [[USFL]]. Other owners included [[John Bassett]], a Canadian movie producer, and [[Stephen Arky]], an attorney from Miami. Reynolds was a general partner of the team from 1982 to 1985, the entire existence of the [[USFL]]. The team held a winning record in every year. In [[1983]] they went 11<U+2013>7<U+2013>0 in the Central Division but did not make the playoffs. In [[1984]] they went 14<U+2013>4<U+2013>0 in the Southern Division and lost in the conference semifinals to the [[Birmingham Stallions]] 36<U+2013>17. In [[1985]] they went 10<U+2013>8<U+2013>0 in the Eastern Conference but lost in the quarterfinals to the [[Oakland Invaders]] 30<U+2013>27. 

Reynolds also co-owned a [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup]] team with [[Hal Needham]], which ran the #33 [[Skoal_tobacco#Bandits_and_Pouches|Skoal Bandits]] car, with driver [[Harry Gant]].
