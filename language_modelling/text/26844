[[File:Rowing boats.jpg|thumb|360px|All eight types of racing boats, six of which are part of the [[Olympic Games]]]]
'''Rowing''' is a [[sport]] in which athletes race against each other on rivers, on lakes or on the ocean, depending upon the type of race and the discipline.  The boats are propelled by the reaction forces on the [[Oar (sport rowing)|oar]] blades as they are pushed against the water. The sport can be both recreational, focusing on learning the techniques required,<ref name="Speed Rower, Competitive Rowing">{{cite web |url=http://www.speedrower.com/index.htm |title=Speed Rower, Competitive Rowing |accessdate=2009-02-05 }}</ref> and competitive where overall [[Physical fitness|fitness]] plays a large role. It is also one of the oldest [[Olympic sports]]. In the United States, high school and [[College rowing (United States)|collegiate rowing]] is sometimes referred to as ''crew''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/crew |title=Crew - definition |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=TheFreeDictionary}}</ref>

== Basic information ==
[[Image:Toronto female rowing team.jpg|thumb|350px|Toronto rowers in a coxed four (4+)]]
While rowing, the athlete sits in the boat facing backwards (towards the [[stern]]), and uses the [[oars]] which are held in place by the [[oarlock]]s to propel the boat forward (towards the [[Bow (ship)|bow]]). This may be done on a river, lake, sea, or other large body of water. It is a demanding sport requiring strong core balance as well as physical strength and cardiovascular endurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/medias/docs/media_350411.pdf |title=Introduction |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=Basic Rowing Physiology}}</ref>


Whilst the action of rowing and equipment used remains fairly consistent throughout the world, there are many different types of competition. These include endurance races, [[Head race|time trials]], stake racing, [[Bumps race|bumps racing]], and the side-by-side format used in the [[Olympic games]]. The many different formats are a result of the long [[History of rowing|history of the sport]], its development in different regions of the world, and specific local requirements and restrictions.

There are two forms of rowing:
* In ''[[sweep (rowing)|sweep]]'' or ''sweep-oar'' rowing, each rower has one oar, held with both hands. This can be done in pairs, fours and eights. Each rower in a sweep boat is referred to either as ''[[port (nautical)|port]]'' or ''[[starboard]]'', depending on which side of the boat the rower's oar extends to. Usually the port side is referred to as [[stroke (rowing)|stroke side]], and the starboard side as [[bow (rowing)|bow side]];  this applies even if the stroke oarsman is rowing on bow side and/or the bow oarsman on stroke side.
* In ''[[sculling]]'' each rower has two oars (or ''sculls''), one in each hand. Sculling is usually done without a [[coxswain]], in [[quad scull|quad]]s, [[double scull|double]]s or [[single scull|singles]]. The oar in the sculler's right hand extends to port (stroke side), and the oar in the left hand extends to starboard (bow side).

=== Anatomy of a stroke ===
{{main|Anatomy of a rowing stroke}}
[[File:IMG 7068 Cam holding station with Oxon before Chiswick Pier.jpg|thumb|River Thames at Chiswick during the 2010 University Boat Race (Oxford boat on right, Cambridge on left)]]
The two fundamental reference points in the rowing stroke are the catch, immediately prior to the oar blade's placement in the water, and the extraction (also known as the finish or the release) where the rower removes the oar blade from the water. From the catch, the rower places the blade in the water, then applies pressure to the oar by simultaneously pushing the seat toward the bow of the boat by extending the legs.  As the legs approach full extension, the rower rotates his or her torso toward the bow of the boat and then finally pulls the arms towards his or her chest. The shoulders should not hunch up at any point during the drive. At the very end of the stroke, with the blade still in the water, the hands drop slightly to unload the oar so that spring energy stored in the bend of the oar gets transferred to the boat, which eases removing the oar from the water and minimizes energy wasted on lifting water above the surface (splashing).  The aforementioned stages of the stroke where pressure is applied to the blade through the water comprise the drive of the stroke.

The recovery phase follows the drive. The recovery involves removing the oar from the water, and coordinating the body movement to move the oar to the catch. The coordinated body motion that begins at the finish consists of the following: The rower pushes down on the oar handle (or oar handles if the rower is sculling) to quickly lift the blade from the water at the release.  Following the release, the rower rapidly rotates the oar to cause the blade of the oar to become parallel to the water (a process referred to as "feathering the blade") at the same time as pushing the oar handle away from the chest. After feathering and extending the arms, the rower rotates his or her body forward. Once the hands are past the knees, the rower compresses the legs which moves the seat towards the stern of the boat. The leg compression occurs relatively slowly (compared with the rest of the stroke) which affords the rower a moment to "recover" (hence the recovery nomenclature), and allows the boat to glide through the water. Near the end of the recovery, the rower squares the blade (rotates the blade to perpendicular to the water), and then repeats the stroke again, beginning with the catch.<ref name="Speed Rower, Competitive Rowing"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ara-rowing.org/render.aspx?siteID=1&navIDs=1,42,64 |title=British Rowing Technique |accessdate=2006-12-23 |work=The Amateur Rowing Association |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070219134446/http://www.ara-rowing.org/render.aspx?siteID=1&navIDs=1,42,64 |archivedate = February 19, 2007}}</ref>

In a multi-person boat, the above motion must be executed in precise synchrony with all other rowers in the shell. Coordinated timing at the catch is imperative to avoid "checking" the boat, or slowing its forward progress. Ideally, all rowers arrive at the catch at exactly the same moment, and immediately apply pressure on the oar with the oar in the water which minimizes [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] at the catch. To accomplish this, the oar must be in the water slightly in advance of the rower's arrival at the catch where the seat reverses direction.  When this action is completed correctly a bit of water, called "back splash" is splashed.

=== Breathing during a rowing stroke ===

There are two schools of thought with respect to the appropriate breathing technique during the rowing motion: Full lungs at the catch and empty lungs at the catch.

With the full lung technique, rowers exhale during the stroke and inhale during the recovery. In laboured circumstances, rowers will take a quick pant at the end of the stroke before taking a deep breath on the recovery that fills the lungs by the time the catch is reached.

In the empty-lung technique, rowers inhale during the drive, and exhale during the recovery so that they have empty lungs at the catch. Because the knees come up to the chest when the lungs are empty, this technique allows the rower to reach a little bit further than if the lungs were full of air. Additionally, this technique allows the thighs to compress the chest, collapsing the lungs further than normal, thus inducing greater air (and oxygen) volume exchange during each breath.

A scientific study of the benefits of entrained breathing technique in relatively fit, but untrained rowers did not show any physiological or psychological benefit to either technique.<ref>MACLENNAN, SUSAN E.; SILVESTRI, GERARD A.; WARD, JOSEPH; MAHLER, DONALD A., 1994. Does entrained breathing improve the economy of rowing? Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise 26(5): 610-614.</ref>

=== Rowing propulsion ===
[[Image:GB Pair at Henley 2004.JPG|thumbnail|right|A [[coxless pair]], which is a [[sweep (rowing)|sweep-oar]] boat; the rower on the left of the photo, or the bow of the boat, is rowing "starboard" or "[[bow (rowing)|bowside]]", the rower on the right of the photo and closer to the stern of the boat is rowing "port" or "[[stroke (rowing)|strokeside]]"|alt= The [[Great Britain|GB]] coxless pair of Toby Garbett & Rick Dunn at [[Henley Royal Regatta]] 2004]]
Rowing is a cyclic (or intermittent) form of propulsion such that in the quasi steady-state the motion of the system (the system comprising the rower, the oars, and the boat), is repeated regularly. In order to maintain the steady-state propulsion of the system without either accelerating or decelerating the system, the sum of all the external forces on the system, averaged over the cycle, must be zero. Thus, the average drag (retarding) force on the system must equal the average propulsion force on the system. The drag forces consist of aerodynamic drag on the superstructure of the system (components of the boat situated above the waterline), as well as the hydrodynamic drag on the submerged portion of the system. The propulsion forces are the forward reaction of the water on the oars while in the water.   Note also that the oar can be used to provide a drag force (a force acting against the forward motion) when the system is brought to rest.

Although the oar can be conveniently thought of as a lever with a "fixed" pivot point in the water, the blade moves sideways and sternwards through the water, so that the magnitude of the propulsion force developed is the result of a complex interaction between unsteady fluid mechanics (the water flow around the blade) and solid mechanics and dynamics (the handle force applied to the oar, the oar's inertia and bending characteristic, the acceleration of the boat and so on).

=== Distinction from other watercraft ===
{{main|Watercraft rowing}}

The distinction between rowing and other forms of water transport, such as [[canoe]]ing or [[kayak]]ing, is that in rowing the oars are held in place at a pivot point that is in a fixed position relative to the boat, this point acting as a fulcrum for the oar to act as a [[lever#First-class levers|lever]].  In flatwater rowing, the boat (also called a ''shell'' or ''fine boat'') is narrow to avoid [[Drag (physics)|drag]], and the oars are attached to oarlocks at the end of outriggers extending from the sides of the boat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/physics/basics.html#section2 |title=Resistance |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=Basic Physics of Rowing}}</ref> Racing boats also have sliding seats to allow the use of the legs in addition to the body to apply power to the oar. Like racing kayaks or canoes, most racing shells are inherently unstable.  The rowing boats require oars on either side to prevent them from rolling over.

===Fitness and health===

Rowing is one of the few non-weight bearing sports that [[exercise]]s all the major muscle groups, including [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quads]], [[biceps]], [[triceps]], [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]], [[Gluteal muscles|glutes]] and [[human abdomen|abdominal]] muscles. Rowing improves [[cardiovascular]] endurance and [[muscular strength]].  High-performance rowers tend to be tall and muscular: although extra weight does increase the drag on the boat, the larger athlete's increased power tends to be more significant. The increased power is achieved through increased length of leverage on the oar through longer limbs of the athlete. In multi-rower boats (2,4,or 8), the lightest person typically rows in the bow seat at the front of the boat.

Rowing is a low impact activity with movement only in defined ranges, so twist and sprain injuries are rare.  However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on [[knee joint]]s, the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and the tendons of the forearm, and [[inflammation]] of these are the most common rowing injuries. If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains.

== History ==
{{main|History of rowing}}

Even since the earliest recorded references to rowing, the sporting element has been present. An Egyptian funerary inscription of 1430 BC records that the warrior [[Amenhotep II|Amenhotep]] (Amenophis) II was also renowned for his feats of oarsmanship. In the [[Aeneid]], [[Virgil]] mentions rowing forming part of the funeral games arranged by [[Aeneas]] in honour of his father.<ref name="Burnell, Richard 1997">{{cite book

The first known "modern" rowing races began from competition among the professional [[watermen]] that provided ferry and taxi service on the [[River Thames]] in London. Prizes for wager races were often offered by the London [[Guilds]] and [[Livery Companies]] or wealthy owners of riverside houses.<ref name="Burnell, Richard 1997"/>
The oldest surviving such race, [[Doggett's Coat and Badge]] was first contested in 1715 and is still held annually from [[London Bridge]] to [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/doggett.htm |title=DOGGETT'S COAT & BADGE RACE |accessdate=2006-12-23 |work=Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section }}</ref> During the 19th century these races were to become numerous and popular, attracting large crowds. Prize matches amongst professionals similarly became popular on other rivers throughout Great Britain in the 19th century, notably on the [[River Tyne|Tyne]]. In America, the earliest known race dates back to 1756 in New York, when a pettiauger defeated a Cape Cod whaleboat in a race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/crew/1800s/histy_early.html |title=Historical context of the beginnings of rowing at Penn |accessdate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>

Amateur competition in England began towards the end of the 18th century. Documentary evidence from this period is sparse, but it is known that the Monarch Boat Club of [[Eton College]] and the Isis Club of [[Westminster School]] were both in existence in the 1790s. The Star Club and Arrow Club in London for gentlemen amateurs were also in existence before 1800. At the [[University of Oxford]] bumping races were first organised in 1815 when [[Brasenose College]] and [[Jesus College Boat Club (Oxford)|Jesus College]] boat clubs had the first annual race<ref name="Oxford rowing history">{{cite web |url=http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/history.html |title=A History of Oxford College Rowing |accessdate=2007-01-17 }}</ref> while at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] the first recorded races were in 1827.<ref name="Penn Rowing History">{{cite web|url=http://www.boathouserow.org/pac/pachist2.html |title=The History of the Penn Athletic Club Rowing Association |accessdate=2007-01-17 }}</ref> Brasenose won Oxford University's first Head of the River and claim to be the oldest established boat club in the world.  [[The Boat Race]] between Oxford University and Cambridge University first took place in 1829, and was the second intercollegiate sporting event (following the first Varsity Cricket Match by 2 years). The interest in the first Boat Race and subsequent matches led the town of Henley to begin hosting an annual regatta in 1839.<ref>{{cite book

== Equipment ==

[[Image:Israeli boathouse.jpg|thumbnail|left||Racing shells stored in a [[boathouse]].]]
[[File:DSCN1750-harald-without-nose.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A damaged 8+, showing cross section near the bows and the skin construction.]]

[[Racing shell|Racing boat]]s (often called ''shells'') are long, narrow, and broadly semi-circular in cross-section in order to reduce drag to a minimum. There is some trade off between boat speed and stability in choice of hull shape. They usually have a fin towards the rear, to help prevent roll and yaw and to increase the effectiveness of the rudder.

Originally made from [[wood]], shells are now almost always made from a [[composite material]] (usually a double skin of [[carbon-fibre reinforced plastic]] with a sandwich of honeycomb material) for strength and weight advantages.  FISA rules specify minimum weights for each class of boat so that no individual will gain a great advantage from the use of expensive materials or technology.

There are several different types of boats. They are classified using:

* '''Number of rowers'''. In all forms of modern competition the number is either 1, 2, 4, or 8.
* '''Position of [[coxswain (rowing)|coxswain]]''' (also referred to as cox). Boats are either coxless (''straight''), bow-coxed (also called [[bowloader]]s), or stern-coxed.

Although sculling and sweep boats are generally identical to each other (except having different riggers), they are referred to using different names:

* Sweep: [[coxless pair]] (or straight pair) (2-), [[coxed pair]] (2+), [[Coxless four]] (or straight four) (4-), [[coxed four]] (4+), [[eight (rowing)|eight]] (8+) (always coxed)
* Sculling: [[single scull]] (1x), [[double scull]] (2x), triple scull (3x) (very rare), [[quad scull|quad (or quadruple) scull]] (4x), [[octuple scull]] (8x) (always coxed, and mainly for juniors and exhibition)
*Sweep/Sculling: Queep, 2 scullers and 2 sweepers (very rare) Randan 1 sculler and 2 sweepers (very rare)

With the smaller boats, specialist versions of the shells for sculling can be made lighter. The riggers in sculling apply the forces symmetrically to each side of the boat, whereas in sweep oared racing these forces are staggered alternately along the boat. The sweep oared boat has to be stiffer to handle these unmatched forces, so consequently requires more bracing and is usually heavier - a pair (2-) is usually a more robust boat than a double scull (2x) for example, and being heavier is also slower when used as a double scull. In theory this could also apply to the 4x and 8x, but most rowing clubs cannot afford to have a dedicated large hull which might be rarely used and instead generally opt for versatility in their fleet by using stronger shells which can be rigged for either sweep rowing or sculling. The symmetrical forces also make sculling more efficient than rowing: the double scull is faster than the coxless pair, and the quadruple scull is faster than the coxless four.
One additional boat is the ''queep'', a coxed or non-coxed shell. The bow and stroke positions have a set of sculling riggers and two and three have a sweep set. These shells have been used in the UK and recently at a club in Victoria BC, Canada.

In addition to the queep the ''trop'' and the ''coxed trop'' are become more mainstream. They are mainly rowed in central Canada. The trop shell consists of three people where the bow has a pair of sculling oars, and 2,3 each a sweeping oar. A coxed trop is the same configuration as the trop plus a coxed seated at the stern of the boat.

Many adjustments can be made to the equipment to accommodate the physiques of the crew.  Collectively these adjustments are known as the boat's [[Boat rigging (sport rowing)|rigging]].

[[Image:Croker Sculling Oars.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Two hatchet sculls. The "blades" are at the top and the handles at the bottom of the picture.]]

===Steering===
Single and double sculls are usually steered by the scullers pulling harder on one side or the other.  In other boats there is a [[rudder]], controlled by the coxswain, if present, or by one of the crew.  In the latter case the rudder cable is attached to the toe of one of their shoes which can pivot about the ball of the foot, moving the cable left or right.  The steersman may row at bow, who has the best vision when looking over their shoulder, or on straighter courses stroke may steer, since they can point the stern of the boat at some landmark at the start of the course.  On international courses landmarks for steersmen, consisting of two aligned poles, are provided.

=== Oars ===
{{main|Oar (sport rowing)}}

Oars are used to propel the boat. They are long (sculling: 250<U+2013>300&nbsp;cm; rowing 340<U+2013>360&nbsp;cm) poles with one flat end about 50&nbsp;cm long and 25&nbsp;cm wide, called the blade. Classic oars were made out of [[wood]], but modern oars are made from [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic]] material, the most common being [[carbon fiber]].

An oar is often referred to as a ''blade'' in the case of sweep oar rowing and as a ''scull'' in the case of sculling. A sculling oar is shorter and has a smaller blade area than the equivalent sweep oar. The combined blade area of a pair of sculls is however greater than that of a single sweep oar, so the oarsman when sculling is working against more water than when rowing sweep-oared. He is able to do this because the body action in sculling is more anatomically efficient (due to the symmetry).

==== Colours ====
{{see also|List of rowing blades}}

The ''spoon'' of oars is normally painted with the colours of the club to which they belong. This greatly simplifies identification of boats at a distance.

=== Indoor rowing ===
[[Image:Concept2 Indoor Rowers.JPG|thumb|200px|A row of ergometers]]
{{main|indoor rower}}

Ergometer rowing machines (colloquially ''ergs'' or ''ergo'') simulate the rowing action and provide a means of training on land when waterborne training is restricted, and of measuring rowing fitness.  Ergometers do not simulate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing including the sweep of the oar handles.  For that reason ergometer scores are generally not used as the sole selection criterion for crews, and technique training is limited to the basic body position and movements. However, this action can still allow a comparable workout to those experienced on the water.

Indoor rowing has become popular as a sport in its own right with numerous indoor competitions (and the annual World Championship [[CRASH-B Sprints]] in Boston) during the winter off-season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.concept2.co.uk/racing/ |title=Racing |accessdate=2007-01-02 |work=Concept2.co.uk}}</ref>

=== Boat storage and boathouses ===

Racing boats, usually together with oars, riggers, and other equipment for rowing, are stored in specially designed storage areas <U+2014> or boathouses. These usually consist of a long two-story building, in which the boats are stored on ''racks'' (horizontal, usually metal, bars) on the ground floor with a large door at one end which most probably leads out to a pontoon on the river or lakeside. Other equipment is stored around the boats. Upstairs, there is usually a gym, bar, an area for relaxation, or, rarely, more storage (due to difficulties transporting cumbersome rowing equipment upstairs). Boats are conveyed to competitions on special trailers accommodating up to 20 boats.

== Competition ==

Rowers may take part in the sport for their leisure or they may row competitively. There are different types of competition in the sport of rowing. In the U.S. all types of races are referred to as ''regattas'' whereas this term is only used in the UK for head-to-head races which take place in the summer season. Time trials occur in the UK during the winter, and are referred to as [[Head race]]s.

Rowing is unusual in the demands it places on competitors. The standard [[Rowing World Championships|world championship]] race distance of 2,000&nbsp;metres is long enough to have a large endurance element, but short enough (typically 5.5 to 7.5&nbsp;minutes) to feel like a sprint. This means that rowers have some of the highest power outputs of athletes in any sport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  At the same time the motion involved in the sport compresses the rowers' lungs, limiting the amount of oxygen available to them. This requires rowers to tailor their breathing to the stroke, typically inhaling and exhaling twice per stroke, unlike most other sports such as cycling where competitors can breathe freely.

=== Side by side ===

Most races that are held in the spring and summer feature '''[[Regatta|side by side]]''' racing also called a regatta; all the boats start at the same time from a stationary position and the winner is the boat that crosses the finish line first. The number of boats in a race typically varies between two (which is sometimes referred to as a ''dual race'') to six, but any number of boats can start together if the course is wide enough.

The standard length races for the Olympics and the [[World Rowing Championships]] is 2,000&nbsp;m long, 1,500 <U+2013> 2,000&nbsp;m for US high school races on the east coast and 1,000&nbsp;m for ''masters'' rowers (rowers older than 27). However the race distance can and does vary from ''dashes'' or sprints, which may be 500&nbsp;m long, to races of marathon or ultra-marathon length races such as the [[Tour du L<U+00E9>man]] in Switzerland which is 160&nbsp;km,<ref>{{cite news |last=St<U+00E9>phane |first=Trachsler |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/display/modules/news/dspNews.php?newid=324046 |title=Records fall in Lake Geneva Tour |publisher=[http://www.worldrowing.com/ world rowing.com] |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> and the 2&nbsp;day, 185&nbsp;km Corvallis to Portland Regatta<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newworldrowing.org/cpr/index.htm |title=Corvallis to Portland Regatta (CPR) |publisher=[http://www.newworldrowing.org new world rowing.org] |accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref> held in Oregon, USA. In the UK, regattas are generally between 500&nbsp;m and 2,000&nbsp;m long.


A feature of the end of twentieth century rowing was the development of non-olympic multicrew racing boats, typically gigs, pilot boats and in Finland church- or longboats. The most usual craft in races are held around the coasts of Britain during summer months is the [[Cornish pilot gig]], most typically in the south-west, with crews of 6 from local towns and races of varying distances. In Finland 14-oared churchboats race throughout the summer months, usually on lakes, and often with mixed crews. The largest gathering sees over 7000 rowers mainly rowing the 60&nbsp;km course at Sulkava <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.suursoudut.fi/en |title=Suursoudut|publisher=[http://www.suursoudut.fi] |accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> near the eastern border over a long weekend in mid July. The weekend features the World Masters churchboat event which also includes a 2&nbsp;km dash. <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wmrowing-sulkava.fi/ |title=World Masters Rowing|publisher=[http://www.wmrowing-sulkava.fi] |accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref>

Two traditional non-standard distance shell races are the annual [[Boat Race]] between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] and the [[Harvard-Yale Boat Race]] which cover courses of approximately four miles (roughly 6.5&nbsp;km). The [[Henley Royal Regatta]] is also raced upon a non-standard distance at 1&nbsp;mile, 550&nbsp;yards (2,112&nbsp;meters).

In general, multi-boat competitions are organized in a series of rounds, with the fastest boats in each heat qualifying for the next round. The losing boats from each heat may be given a second chance to qualify through a [[repechage]]. The World Rowing Championships offers multi-lane racing in heats, finals and repechages. At Henley Royal Regatta two crews compete side by side in each round, in a straightforward [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out format]], with no repechages.

=== Head races ===
{{main|Head race}}

'''[[Head race]]s''' are [[time trial]] / processional races that take place from autumn (fall) to early spring (depending on local conditions). Boats begin with a rolling start at [[interval (time)|interval]]s of 10 <U+2013> 20&nbsp;seconds, and are timed over a set distance. Head courses usually vary in length from 2,000&nbsp;m to 12,000&nbsp;m, though there are longer races such as the [[Boston Rowing Marathon]] and shorter such as [[Pairs Head]].

The oldest, and arguably most famous, head race is the [[Head of the River Race]], founded by [[Steve Fairbairn]] in 1926 which takes place each March on the river [[Thames]] in [[London]], United Kingdom. Head racing was exported to the United States in the 1950s, and the [[Head of the Charles|Head of the Charles Regatta]] held each October on the [[Charles River]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[USA]] is now the largest rowing event in the world.

These processional races are known as ''Head Races'', because, as with bumps racing, the fastest crew is awarded the title ''Head of the River'' (as in "head of the class"). It was not deemed feasible to run bumps racing on the Tideway, so a timed format was adopted and soon caught on.

Time trials are sometimes used to determine who competes in an event where there is a limited number of entries, for example the qualifying races for Henley Royal Regatta, and ''rowing on'' and ''getting on'' for the Oxford and Cambridge [[Bumps race]]s respectively.

=== Bumps races ===
{{main|Bumps race}}
[[File:Bumps race Oxford 1999.ogv|thumb|alt=A rowing race|A "bump" during [[Torpids]] at the University of Oxford, 1999: [[Jesus College Boat Club (Oxford)|Jesus College Men's 1st VIII]] catch [[Hertford College, Oxford|Hertford College]].]]
A third type of race is the '''[[bumps race]]''', as held in Oxford (known as [[Torpids]] and [[Summer Eights]]), Cambridge (known as the [[Lent Bumps]] and the [[May Bumps]]), between the London medical and Veterinary schools (the [http://www.uhboatclub.co.uk/ United Hospitals Bumps]) on the [[Tideway]] and at [[Eton College]] and [[Shrewsbury School]] (which are the only schools in Britain to continue this tradition). In these races, crews start lined up along the river at set intervals, and all start at the same time. The aim is to catch up with the boat in front, and avoid being caught by the boat behind. If a crew overtakes or makes physical contact with the crew ahead, a ''bump'' is awarded. As a result damage to boats and equipment is common during bumps racing. To avoid damage the cox of the crew being bumped may concede the bump before contact is actually made. The next day, the bumping crew will start ahead of any crews that have been bumped. Bumps races take place over several days, and the positions at the end of the last race are used to set the positions on the first day of the races the next year. Oxford and Cambridge Universities hold bumps races for their respective colleges twice a year, and there are also ''Town Bumps'' races in both cities, open to non-university crews. Oxford's races are organised by City of Oxford Rowing Club<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordrowingclub.org.uk/bumps.html |title=Bumps |accessdate=2011-1-20 |publisher=City of Oxford Rowing Club }}</ref> and Cambridge's are organised by the [[Cambridgeshire Rowing Association]].

=== Stake races ===

The stake format was often used in early American races. Competitors line up at the start, race to a stake, moored boat, or buoy some distance away, and return. The 180<U+00B0> turn requires mastery of steering. These races are popular with spectators because one may watch both the start and finish. Usually only two boats would race at once to avoid collision. The Green Mountain Head Regatta continues to use the stake format but it is run as a head race with an interval start.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trust.dosolutions.com/gmh/ |title=Green Mountain Head Regatta |accessdate=2007-01-27 }}</ref> A similar type of racing is found in UK coastal rowing, where a number of boats race out to a given point from the coast and then return fighting rough water all the way.

=== World championships and Olympics ===

[[Image:Rrrowingg.jpg|thumb|200px|Rowing at the [[Olympic Games]] on an East German Stamp for the 1980s Olympic Games]]

{{main|World Rowing Championships|Rowing at the Summer Olympics}}

The [[Olympic Games]] are held every four years, where only select boat classes are raced (14 in total):

* Men: [[quad scull]], [[double scull]], [[single scull]], [[Eight (rowing)|eight]], [[coxless four]], and [[coxless pair]]
* Lightweight Men: [[coxless four]] and [[double scull]]
* Women: [[quad scull]], [[double scull]], [[single scull]], [[Eight (rowing)|eight]], and [[coxless pair]]
* Lightweight Women: [[double scull]]

At the end of each year, the [[International Federation of Rowing Associations|FISA]] holds the World Rowing Championships with events in 22 different boat classes. Athletes generally consider the Olympic classes to be premier events and are more interested in rowing in these than at the World Championships. During Olympic years only non-Olympic boats compete at the World Championships.

=== Rules of racing ===

There are many differing sets of rules governing racing and these are generally defined by the governing body of the sport in a particular country. In England and Wales this is [[British Rowing]],  Australia this is [[Rowing Australia]] and the US [[USRowing]] sets the rules. In international competition the rules are set out by the world governing body [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale des Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s d'Aviron|FISA]]. The rules may vary slightly but are generally very similar. The main notable difference between British Rowing rules and FISA rules is that coxes are not required to wear buoyancy aids in international events governed by FISA, whereas they are required to wear one at all times under the British Rowing rules.

== The crew ==
{{main|Boat positions (sport rowing)}}

In all boats, with the exception of single sculls, each rower is numbered in sequential order, low numbers at the bow, up to the highest at the stern. The person seated on the first seat is called the bowman, or just 'bow', whilst the rower closest to the stern is called the 'strokeman' or just 'stroke'.  There are some exceptions to this - some UK coastal rowers, and in France, Spain, and Italy rowers number from stern to bow.

In addition to this, certain crew members have other titles and roles. In an 8+ the stern pair are responsible for setting the stroke rate and rhythm for the rest of the boat to follow. The middle four (sometimes called the "engine room" or "power house") are usually the less technical, but more powerful rowers in the crew, whilst the bow pair are the more technical and generally regarded as the pair to set up the balance of the boat. They also have most influence on the line the boat steers.

In most levels of rowing there are different weight classes - typically "open" or "heavyweight" and lightweight (discussed below). Competitive rowing favours tall, muscular athletes due to the additional leverage height provides in pulling the oar through the water as well as the explosive power needed to propel the boat at high speed. Open or heavyweight rowers of both sexes tend to be very tall, broad-shouldered, have long arms and legs as well as tremendous cardiovascular capacity and very low body fat ratios. Olympic or International level heavyweight male oarsmen are typically anywhere between 6'3" and 6'9" (190&nbsp;cm to 206&nbsp;cm) tall with most being around 6'6" (198&nbsp;cm) and weighing approximately 225&nbsp;lb (102&nbsp;kg) with about 6 to 7% body fat. Heavyweight women are slightly shorter at around 6'1" (180&nbsp;cm) and lighter than their male counterparts.

=== Lightweights ===
{{main|Lightweight rowing}}

Unlike most other non-combat sports, rowing has a special weight category called ''lightweight'' (Lwt for short). According to FISA, this weight category was introduced "to encourage more universality in the sport especially among nations with less statuesque people". The first lightweight events were held at the World Championships in [[1974 World Rowing Championships|1974]] for men and [[1985 World Rowing Championships|1985]] for women. Lightweight rowing was added to the Olympics in [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]].

At international level the limits are:

* Men: Crew average 70&nbsp;kg (154&nbsp;lb) - no rower over 72.5&nbsp;kg (160&nbsp;lb)
* Women: Crew average 57&nbsp;kilograms (125&nbsp;lb) - no rower over 59&nbsp;kg (130&nbsp;lb)

Olympic lightweight boat classes are limited to:
* Men's double (LM2x)
* Men's four (LM4-)
* Women's double (LW2x)

At the junior level (in the United States), regattas require each rower to weigh in at least two hours before their race; they are sometimes given two chances to make weight at smaller regattas, with the exception of older more prestigious regattas, which allow only one opportunity to make weight. For juniors in the United States, the lightweight cutoff for men is 160.0&nbsp;lb.; for women, it is 130.0&nbsp;lb. In the fall the weight limits are increased for women, with the cutoff being 135&nbsp;lb.

At the collegiate level (in the United States), the lightweight weight requirements can be different depending on competitive season.  For fall regattas (typically head races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 160.0&nbsp;lb. and 135.0&nbsp;lb. for women.  In the spring season (typically sprint races), the lightweight cutoff for men is 160.0&nbsp;lb., with a boat average of 155.0&nbsp;lb. for the crew; for women, the lightweight cutoff is 130.0&nbsp;lb.<ref>http://www.usrowing.org/Parents/RowingClassifications/index.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.patriotleague.org/sports/w-rowing/spec-rel/041808aad.html</ref>

=== Women ===

For most of its history, rowing has been a male dominated sport. Although rowing's roots as a sport in the modern Olympics can be traced back to the original [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896 games]] in [[Athens]], it was not until the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] that women were allowed to participate <U+2014> well after their fellow athletes in similar sports such as [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[cycling]], and [[canoeing]].

Despite its male domination, women's rowing can be traced back to the early 19th century, and an image of a women's double scull race made the cover of [[Harper's Weekly]] in 1870. Wellesley College (located in the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts)  was the first school to organize a competitive  rowing team for women in the late 19th century.  The 19th Century Cornish rower [[Ann Glanville]] achieved national celebrity; her all-women crew often winning against the best male teams.<ref>http://www.sense-of-place.co.uk/AnnGlanville/previewFlash.html</ref> In 1927, the first rowing event for women between Oxford and Cambridge was held. For the first few years it was an exhibition, and it later became a race.  [[Ernestine Bayer]], called the "Mother of Women's Rowing", formed the [[Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club]] in 1938.

In 1954, the first women's events were added to the [[European Rowing Championships]]. In 1988, the first [[Henley Women's Regatta]] was held. Henley Royal Regatta first included a women's singles event over the full course in 1993, followed in 2000 by eights (now [[Remenham Challenge Cup]]) and 2001 by quadruple sculls (now [[Princess Grace Challenge Cup]]).  On April 27, 1997, one of the last bastions of rowing was breached when, at an Extraordinary General Meeting, [[Leander Club]] voted to admit women as members. This rule met a condition imposed by [[UK Sport]] and qualified Leander to receive a <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million grant for refurbishment from the Lottery Sports Fund.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regatta.rowing.org.uk/99-leander.html |title=Leander voted for women |accessdate=2006-12-23 |work=REGATTA OnLine }}</ref>

At the international level, women's rowing traditionally has been dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, and New Zealand often field competitive teams. The United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's [[College rowing (United States)|collegiate rowing]] due to [[Title IX]].  Because Title IX mandates equal money spent on men's and women's sports, rowing is particularly useful due to the extremely high costs of equipment per athlete.  Therefore, many schools open a rowing program only to women to financially counteract the prevalence of men's sports.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the United States, it is important to note that Women's Rowing is an NCAA sport, while Men's Rowing chooses to remain governed by its own regulatory body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA).  The IRA, formed in 1895, preceded the NCAA by at least ten years and provided a guideline for the rules of eligibility and sportsmanship later adopted by the NCAA when it was formed.

=== Adaptive athletes ===
{{main|Adaptive rowing}}

Adaptive rowing is a special category of races for those with physical disabilities. Under FISA rules there are 5 boat classes for adaptive rowers; mixed (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed intellectual disability (2 men and 2 women plus cox) LTA (Legs, Trunk, Arms), mixed (1 man and 1 woman) TA (Trunk and Arms), and men's and women's AS (Arms and Shoulders). Events are held at the World Rowing Championships and were also held at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=17 |title= Paralympic/Adaptive|accessdate=2006-12-23 |work=WorldRowing.com }}</ref>

== Terminology and event nomenclature ==
{{main|Glossary of rowing terms}}

Rowing events use a systematic [[wikt:nomenclature|nomenclature]] for the naming of events, so that age, gender, ability and size of boat can all be expressed in a few numbers and letters. The first letter to be used is 'L' or 'Lt' for lightweight. If absent then the crew is open weight. This can be followed by either a 'J' or 'B' to signify junior (under 19 years) or under 23 years respectively. If absent the crew is open age (the letter 'O' is sometimes used). Next is either an 'M' or 'W' to signify if the crew are men or women. Then there is a number to show how many athletes are in the boat (1,2,4 or 8). An 'x' following the number indicates a sculling boat. Finally either a + or - is added to indicate whether the boat is coxed or coxswainless.

Some events will use an experience rating to separate races. In the UK boats are classed as "Elite", "Senior", "Intermediate 1/2/3" or "Novice", depending on the number of wins the athletes have accumulated. Masters events use age ranges to separate crews of older rowers.

Examples:

* M8+ or 8+ ''men's eight'' (Always coxed.  Sometimes written as 8o for "8-oared".)
* W4- ''women's coxless four (or "straight four")''
* LM2- ''lightweight men's coxless pair''
* BM1x ''men's single sculls under age 23''
* JW4x ''junior women's quad''
* Masters WC2x ''masters women's double sculls with average crew age between 43-50''
* Mixed Masters 8+ ''coxed eight with 4 women and 4 men as rowers and a coxswain of either gender''
