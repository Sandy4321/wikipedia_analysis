'''Turkish''' ({{lang|tr|''T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e''}}) is a language belonging to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]], spoken predominantly in [[Turkey]], with smaller communities of speakers in [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Romania]], as well as by several million emigrants in [[Western Europe]]<ref name="Ethnologue Turkish"/><ref name="Turks in the European Union">{{cite web|author=[http://www.zft-online.de Center for Studies on Turkey], [[University of Essen]]|publisher=Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association|url=http://www.tusiad.org/haberler/basin/ab/9.pdf|title=The European Turks: Gross Domestic Product, Working Population, Entrepreneurs and Household Data|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-01-06|date=2003}}</ref>. Turkish is the largest member of the Turkic language family in terms of the number of speakers, with some 50<ref name="Ethnologue Turkish"/><U+2013>65<ref name="Ministry of Culture and Tourism"/> million native speakers. There is a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between Turkish and other [[Oghuz languages]], including [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]], and if these are counted together as "Turkish", the number of native speakers is close to 90 million<!--SIL Ethnologue data: 50M Turkish, 33M Azeri/Qashqai, 6M Turkmen-->.

Turkish is characterized by [[vowel harmony]], [[agglutination]], lack of [[grammatical gender]], and a highly [[phonetic spelling]].

==Classification==
Turkish is a member of the Turkish, or Western, subgroup of the [[Oghuz languages]], which also includes [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]] and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]]. The Oghuz languages form a subgroup of the [[Turkic languages]], which some linguists believe to be a part of a larger [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]]<ref name="Ethnologue Altaic"/>. 

The most distinguishing characteristics of Turkish in comparison to most other languages are [[vowel harmony]] and extensive [[Agglutinative language|agglutination]]. The basic word order of Turkish is [[Subject Object Verb]]. Turkish has a [[T-V distinction]]: second-person plural forms can be used for individuals as a sign of respect. Turkish also has no [[noun class]]es or [[grammatical gender]].

==Geographic distribution==
{{seealso|Turkish diaspora}}
Turkish is natively spoken by the [[Turkish people]] in Turkey and by the [[Turkish diaspora]] in some 30 other countries. In particular, Turkish speaking minorities exist in countries that formerly (in whole or part) belonged to the [[Ottoman Empire]], such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] (primarily in [[Western Thrace]]), the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]]<ref name="Ethnologue Turkish"/>. More than two million Turkish speaking people live in [[Germany]], and there are significant Turkish speaking communities in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name="Turks in the European Union"/>. But due to the [[desegregation]] of the Turkish immigrants into the country where they immigrated to, not every ethnic Turkish immigrant speaks the language as well as a native Turk would speak it.

The exact number of native speakers in Turkey is uncertain, primarily due to a lack of minority language data. Turkish is spoken as a first or second language by almost all of Turkey's residents, with [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] making up most of the remainder (about 3,950,000 as estimated in 1980)<ref name="Ethnologue Kurdish">{{cite web|author=Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.)|authorlink=Ethnologue|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kmr|title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition. Report for language code:kmr (Kurdish)|format=HTML|accessdate=2007-03-18|date=2005}}</ref>. However, the vast majority of the linguistic minorities in Turkey are bilingual, speaking Turkish as a second language to levels of native fluency. 

===Official status===
Turkish is the official language of [[Turkey]], and is one of the official languages of [[Cyprus]]. It also has official (but not primary) status in several municipalities of [[Republic of Macedonia]], depending on the concentration of Turkish-speaking local population as well as the [[Prizren District]] of [[Kosovo]].

In Turkey, the regulatory body for Turkish is the [[Turkish Language Association]] (Turkish: T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu - TDK), which was founded in [[1932]] under the name ''T<U+00FC>rk Dili Tetkik Cemiyeti'' ("Society for Research on the Turkish Language"). The Turkish Language Association was influenced by the [[linguistic purism]] ideology and one of its primary acts was the replacement of loanwords and foreign grammatical constructs in the language with their Turkish equivalents, which, together with the adoption of the new [[Turkish alphabet]] in [[1928]], shaped the modern Turkish language as it is in use today (details covered in the section on language reform, further below). TDK became an independent body in [[1951]], with the lifting of the requirement that it should be presided over by the Minister of Education. This status continued until August, [[1983]], when it was again tied to the government with the [[Constitution of Turkey|constitution of 1982]] following the military [[1980 Turkish coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup d'<U+00E9>tat of 1980]].<ref name="TDK History">{{cite web|author=Turkish Language Association|authorlink=Turkish Language Association|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF2858DA18F4388CDD|title=T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu - Tarih<U+00E7>e (History of the Turkish Language Association)|format=HTML|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>

===Dialects===
The [[Istanbul]] [[dialect]] of Turkish (''<U+0130>stanbul T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>esi'') is established as the official [[standard language]] within Turkey. In spite of the [[Dialect levelling|levelling]] influence of the standard used in [[mass media]] and [[Education in Turkey|Turkish education system]] since the [[1930s]], a considerably rich dialectal variation persists<ref name="Johanson">{{cite paper|author=Johanson, Lars|title=Discoveries on the Turkic linguistic map|publisher=Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul|date=2001|url=http://www.srii.org/Map.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref>. Academically, researchers from Turkey often refer to Turkish dialects as ''a<U+011F><U+0131>z'' or ''<U+015F>ive'', leading to an ambiguity with the linguistic concept of [[Accent (linguistics)|accent]], which is also covered with these same words. Projects investigating Turkish dialects are being carried out by several universities, as well as a dedicated work group of the [[Turkish Language Association]] and work is currently in progress for the compilation and publication of the research as a comprehensive dialect [[atlas]] of the Turkish language.<ref name="Dialects Workshop">{{cite paper|author=<U+00D6>zsoy, A.

Main dialects of Turkish include:

* ''<U+0130>stanbul'', the standard dialect
* ''Rumelice'', spoken by [[Immigration to Turkey|immigrants]] from [[Rumelia]], including the peculiar dialects of Dinler and Adakale 
* ''K<U+0131>br<U+0131>s'', [[Cypriot Turkish]], spoken on the island of [[Cyprus]]
* ''Edirne'', spoken in [[Edirne]]
* ''Do<U+011F>u'', spoken in [[Eastern Anatolia Region, Turkey|Eastern Anatolia]], has a [[dialect continuum]] with [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] in some areas
* ''Karadeniz'', spoken in the Eastern [[Black Sea Region, Turkey|Black Sea Region]] and is represented primarily by the [[Trabzon]] dialect, which exhibits some [[substratum]] influence from [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[phonology]] and [[syntax]]<ref name="Brendemoen">{{Citation|last=Brendemoen|first=B.|contribution=Phonological Aspects of Greek-Turkish Language Contact in Trabzon|date=1996|title=Conference on Turkish in Contact, Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS) in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Wassenaar, 5-6 February, 1996}}</ref>
* ''Ege'', spoken in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] region and extending to [[Antalya]]
* ''G<U+00FC>neydo<U+011F>u'', spoken in the south, to the east of [[Mersin]]
* ''Orta Anadolu'', spoken in the [[Central Anatolia Region, Turkey|Central Anatolia]] region
* ''Kastamonu'', spoken in [[Kastamonu]] and vicinity
* ''Karamanl<U+0131>ca'', spoken in [[Greece]], where it is also named ''K<U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1>'' (Karamanlidika), and is also the literary standard for [[Karamanlides]]

==Sounds==
{{IPA notice}}
{{seealso|Turkish alphabet}}
One characteristic feature of Turkish is [[vowel harmony]], meaning that a word will have either [[front vowel|front]] or [[back vowel]]s, but not both. For example, in ''vi<U+015F>ne'' ("sour cherry"), ''i'' is a closed unround front vowel and ''e'' is an open unround front vowel. [[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is usually on the last syllable, with the exception of some [[suffix]] combinations, and words like ''masa'' ('''masa''). Also, in the use of proper names, the stress is transferred to the syllable before the last (''e.g.'' ''<U+0130>st<U+00E1>nbul''), although there are exceptions to this (''e.g.'' ''<U+00C1>nkara'').

The phoneme {{IPA|/<U+0263>/}} usually referred to as "soft g"(yumu<U+015F>ak g), ''<U+011F>'' in Turkish [[orthography]], actually represents a rather weak front-velar or palatal approximant between front vowels. It never occurs at the beginning of a word, but always follows a vowel. When word-final or preceding another consonant, it lengthens the preceding vowel.

===Vowels===
{| align="right"
!align="right"|IPA chart for Turkish [[monophthong]]s
|-
|[[Image:Turkish_vowel_chart.png]]
|}

The vowels of the [[Turkish]] language are, in their alphabetical order, ''a'', ''e'', [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|''<U+0131>'']], [[Turkish dotted and dotless I|''i'']], ''o'', ''<U+00F6>'', ''u'', ''<U+00FC>''. There are no [[diphthongs]] in Turkish and when two vowels come together, which occurs rarely and only with [[loanword]]s, each vowel retains its individual sound.

==Grammar==
{{main|Turkish grammar}}

Turkish is an [[agglutinative language]] and as such has an abundance of [[suffix]]es, but no native prefixes, apart from the reduplicating intensifier  prefix as in ''beyaz'' ("white"), ''bembeyaz'' ("very white"), ''s<U+0131>cak'' ("hot"), ''s<U+0131>ms<U+0131>cak'' ("very hot"). One word can have many suffixes and these can also be used to create new words (like creating a verb from a noun, or a noun from a verbal root, see [[#Vocabulary|Vocabulary]] section further below) or to indicate the grammatical function of the word.

===Nouns and adjectives===
Turkish nouns can take endings indicating the person of a possessor. They are declined by taking case-endings, as in [[Latin]]. There are six [[Declension|noun cases]] in the Turkish declension system:

*[[Nominative case|Nominative]]
*[[Genitive case|Genitive]], formed by adding ''-<U+0131>n'', ''-in'', ''-un'' or ''-<U+00FC>n'', according to the vowel harmony
*[[Dative case|Dative]], formed by adding ''-a'' or ''-e'', according to the vowel harmony
*[[Accusative case|Accusative]], formed by adding ''-<U+0131>'', ''-i'', ''-u'' or ''-<U+00FC>'', according to the vowel harmony
*[[Ablative case|Ablative]], formed by adding ''-den'' or ''-dan'', according to the vowel harmony
*[[Locative case|Locative]], formed by adding ''-de'' or ''-da'', according to the vowel harmony
*[[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]. There is also a very common practice of adding the [[Adposition|postposition]] ''ile'', meaning ''with'', as a suffix to the end of nouns (''-le'' or ''-la'', again according to the vowel harmony) which could be treated as an instrumental case.

Taking ''g<U+00FC>n'' ("day") as an example:

{|class = "wikitable"
|-
!Turkish
!English
!Noun case
|-
|''g<U+00FC>n''
|align="right"|(the) day
|Nominative
|-
|''g<U+00FC>n<U+00FC>n''
|align="right"|a day's<br>the day's<br>of the day
|Genitive
|-
|''g<U+00FC>ne''
|align="right"|to the day
|Dative
|-
|''g<U+00FC>n<U+00FC>''
|align="right"|the day
|Accusative
|-
|''g<U+00FC>nden''
|align="right"|of/from the day
|Ablative
|-
|''g<U+00FC>nde''
|align="right"|in the day
|Locative
|-
|''g<U+00FC>nle''
|align="right"|with the day
|Instrumental
|}

The series of case-endings is the same for every noun, selecting the suffix complying with the vowel harmony. The initial consonant of the suffixes for the ablative and locative cases can also vary depending on the last consonant of the noun being voiced or unvoiced, such as having ''hava'' ("air") + ''-da'' (locative suffix) = ''havada'' ("in the air"), but, ''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>'' ("tree") + ''-da'' (locative suffix) = ''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>ta'' ("on the tree"), instead of ''a<U+011F>a<U+00E7>da''.

Additionally, nouns can take suffixes that give them a person and make them into sentences:

It is often cited, humorously, that the longest Turkish word ever formed was "''<U+00C7>ekoslovakyal<U+0131>la<U+015F>t<U+0131>ramad<U+0131>klar<U+0131>m<U+0131>zdan m<U+0131>yd<U+0131>n<U+0131>z?''" which literally means "''Were you one of the people we couldn't turn into (or: pass off as) a Czechoslovakian?''", although it is always possible to form words longer than any given length via repetitive usage of some derivative suffix. The shortest word in Turkish is "''o''", the third person singular [[personal pronoun]] (corresponding to ''he'', ''she'', and ''it'' in English).

Turkish adjectives as such are not [[declension|declined]], though they can generally be used as nouns, in which case they ''are'' declined. Used attributively, adjectives precede the nouns they modify. The adjectives ''var'' ("existent") and ''yok'' ("non-existent") are used in many cases where English would use "there is" or "have", ''e.g.'' ''s<U+00FC>t yok'' ("there is no milk", ''lit.'' "(the) milk (is) non-existent"); the construction "''noun 1''-GEN ''noun 2''-POSS var/yok" can be translated "''noun 1'' has/doesn't have ''noun 2''"; ''imparatorun elbisesi yok'' "the emperor has no clothes" ("(the) emperor-''of'' clothes-''his'' non-existent"); ''kedimin ayakkab<U+0131>lar<U+0131> yoktu'' ("my cat had no shoes", ''lit.'' "cat-''my''-''of'' shoe-''plur.''-''its'' non-existent-''past tense''").

===Verbs===
Turkish verbs exhibit [[Grammatical person|person]]. Again with the use of suffixes, they can be made negative or impotential; they can also be made potential. Finally, Turkish verbs exhibit various distinctions of [[Grammatical tense|tense]] ([[Present tense|present]], [[Past tense|past]], inferential, [[Future tense|future]], and [[aorist]]), [[Grammatical mood|mood]] ([[Conditional mood|conditional]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], necessitative, and [[Optative mood|optative]]), and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

===Vowel harmony===
{{Details|Vowel harmony}}
"Vowel harmony" is the principle by which a native Turkish word generally incorporates either exclusively [[back vowel]]s (''a'', ''<U+0131>'', ''o'', ''u'') or exclusively [[front vowel]]s (''e'', ''i'', ''<U+00F6>'', ''<U+00FC>''). As such, a notation for a Turkish suffix such as ''-den'' means either ''-dan'' or ''-den'', whichever promotes vowel harmony; a notation such as ''-iniz'' means either ''-<U+0131>n<U+0131>z'', ''-iniz'', ''-unuz'', or ''-<U+00FC>n<U+00FC>z'', again with vowel harmony constituting the deciding factor.

The Turkish vowel harmony system can be considered as being 2-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by two features: [[Vowel backness|front/back]] and [[Roundedness|rounded/unrounded]] (see the table).

|-
! Low
| ''e'' || ''<U+00F6>'' || ''a'' || ''o''
|-
|}

====Front/back harmony====
Vowel harmony states that a word may not contain both front and back vowels. Therefore, most grammatical suffixes come in front and back forms, e.g. ''y<U+00FC>zey'''de''''' ("on the surface") but ''kap<U+0131>'''da''''' ("on/at the door").

====Rounding harmony====
In addition, there is a secondary rule that ''i'' and ''<U+0131>'' tend to become ''<U+00FC>'' and ''u'' respectively after rounded vowels, so certain suffixes have additional forms. This gives constructions such as ''T<U+00FC>rkiye''''dir''''' ("it is Turkey"), ''kap<U+0131>'''d<U+0131>r''''' ("it is the door"), but ''g<U+00FC>n'''d<U+00FC>r''''' ("it is the day"), ''palto'''dur''''' ("it is the coat").

====Exceptions====
[[Compound words]] are considered separate words with regards to vowel harmony: vowels do not have to harmonize between the constituent words of the compound (thus forms like ''bu''|''g<U+00FC>n'' ("today") or ''ba<U+015F>''|''kent'' ("capital") are permissible). In addition, vowel harmony does not apply for [[loanword]]s and some invariant suffixes, such as ''-iyor'', the conjugation suffix for the present tense; there are also a few native Turkish words that do not follow the rule, such as ''anne'' ("mother"). In such words suffixes harmonize with the final vowel; thus ''<U+0130>stanbul''''dur''''' ("it is <U+0130>stanbul").

===Word order===
Word order in Turkish is generally [[Subject Object Verb]], as in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]] and [[Latin]], but not [[English language|English]]. However, it is possible to alter the word-order according to which word or phrase is to carry the [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]. The main rule is that "the word before the verb has the stress" without exception. For example, if we want to say "Hakan went to school" with a stress on the word "school" (''okul'', the indirect object) we shall say "Hakan ''okula'' gitti". If we want the stress occur to the word "Hakan" (the subject), we shall say "Okula ''Hakan'' gitti" which means "it's Hakan who went to school".

The relative clauses are easily reproduced by a construction so-called "eylemsi" or "fiilimsi" ("verbals"). A demonstration of this can be seen in the following sentence from a newspaper (''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', [[August 16]], [[2005]], p. 1). The sentence incorporates all available noun cases except the genitive:

:''T<U+00FC>rkiye'de moday<U+0131> gazete sayfalar<U+0131>na ta<U+015F><U+0131>yan,''
:''gazetemiz yazarlar<U+0131>ndan N. S. ya<U+015F>am<U+0131>n<U+0131> yitirdi:''

|-
|''yitirdi.''

Which ultimately translates to:

:"One of the writers of our newspaper, N. S., 
: who brought fashion to newspaper pages in Turkey, lost her life."
where "ta<U+015F><U+0131>yan" is the "verbal" corresponding to "who brought" in the English translation.

===Word derivation===
Turkish extensively utilizes its [[agglutinative]] nature to [[Word formation|form new words]] from former nouns and verbal roots. The majority of the Turkish words originate from the application of derivative suffixes to a relatively small set of core vocabulary. 

An example set of words derived agglutinatively from a substantive root:

==History==
===Early history===
{{seealso|Turkic peoples|History of the Turkic peoples}}
[[Image:Kyzyl orkhon inscription.jpg|thumb|Inscription with the [[Orkhon script]], in [[Kyzyl]], [[Russia]]]]
The first records of the [[Turkic languages]] currently attested date back to the [[8th century]] C.E., when two monumental inscriptions were erected in the [[Orkhon Valley]] in honour of the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks|G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rk]] prince [[Kul Tigin]] and his brother Emperor [[Bilge Khan]], between 732 and 735. After the discovery and excavation of the monuments and associated stone slabs in the wider area by [[Russian]] archaeologists between 1889-93, it became established that the language on the inscriptions was the [[Old Turkic language]] written using the [[Orkhon script]], which has also been referred to as ''Turkic runes'' or ''runiform'' due to an external similarity to the [[runic alphabet]]s<ref name="Ishjatms">{{Citation|last=Ishjatms|first=N.|chapter=Nomads In Eastern Central Asia|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia|publisher=UNESCO Publishing|year=1996|volume=2|month=October|isbn=92-3-102846-4}}</ref>.

With the [[Turkic expansion]] during [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. [[6th century|6th]] - [[11th century|11th centuries]]), peoples speaking Turkic languages spread across [[Central Asia]], covering a very broad geographical region stretching from [[Siberia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] of the [[Oghuz Turks]], in particular, brought their language ([[Oghuz languages|Oghuz Turkic]]), the direct ancestor of today's Turkish language, into [[Anatolia]] during [[11th century]]<ref name="Findley">{{cite book|last=Findley|first=Carter V.|title=The Turks in World History|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|month=October|isbn=0-19-517726-6}}</ref>.

Also during the [[11th century]], an early [[linguist]] of the Turkic languages, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Ka<U+015F>garl<U+0131> Mahmud]] from the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], published the first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages, the ''Compendium of the Turkic Dialects'' (Ottoman Turkish: ''Div<U+00E2>n<U+00FC> L<U+00FC>gati't-T<U+00FC>rk''), which also included the first known map of the geographical distribution of Turkic speakers<ref name="Soucek">{{cite book|last=Soucek|first=Svat|title=A History of Inner Asia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|month=March|isbn=978-0521651691}}</ref>.

===Ottoman Turkish===
{{Details|Ottoman Turkish language}}
Following the adoption of [[Islam]] c. 950 C.E. by the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], regarded as the cultural ancestors of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the administrative language of these states acquired a rather large collection of loanwords from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], consecutively influencing Turkish. [[Turkish literature]] during the Ottoman period, in particular [[Ottoman poetry|Ottoman Divan poetry]], was heavily influenced by Persian forms, including the adoption of Persian poetic meters and ultimately the bringing of Persian words into the language in great numbers. During the course of over six hundred years of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (c. 1299-1922), the literary and official language of the empire was a mixture of Turkish, Persian and Arabic, which differed considerably from everyday spoken Turkish of the time, and is now given the name [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].

===Language reform and Modern Turkish===
[[Image:TurkishLanguageConference29August1929.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Participants of the conference on the Turkish alphabet, including [[Atat<U+00FC>rk]]. August 29, 1929]]
After the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]], the [[Turkish Language Association]] (Turkish: T<U+00FC>rk Dil Kurumu - TDK) was established under the patronage of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] in [[1932]], with the aim of conducting research on Turkish language. One of the tasks of the newly established association was to initiate a [[language reform]] replacing loanwords of Arabic and Persian origin in the language with Turkish equivalents. The language reform was a part of the ongoing cultural reforms of the time, which were in turn a part in the broader framework of [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms]]. In [[1928]], the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]], derived from the Arabic script, was abolished in favor of the new Latin-based [[Turkish alphabet]], greatly helping to increase the literacy rate of the population. By banning the usage of replaced loanwords in the press, the association succeeded in removing several hundred foreign words from the language. While most of the words introduced to the language by the TDK were newly derived from [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] roots, TDK also opted for reviving Old Turkish words which had not been used in the language for centuries<ref name="TDK History"/>.

Due to this sudden change in the language, older and younger people in Turkey tend to express themselves with a different vocabulary. While the generations born before the [[1940s]] tend to use the old Arabic origin words, the younger generations favor using new expressions. Some new words are not used as often as their old counterparts or have failed to convey the intrinsic meanings of their old equivalents. There is also a political significance to the old versus new debate in the Turkish language and conservative divisions of the society also tend to use older words in the press or daily language. Therefore, the preferred vocabulary, to some degree, is also indicative of the adoption of or resistance to Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms which took place more than 70 years ago. The last few decades saw the continuing work of the TDK to coin new Turkish words to account for new concepts / technologies as they enter the language as new loanwords (mostly from [[English language|English]]). A great many of these new words, particularly [[Information technology|IT]] terms, received widespread acceptance, but the association is occasionally criticized for coining words that obviously seem or sound like "invented".

It is also worthy of note that a non-negligible amount of the words derived by TDK live together with their old counterparts. The different words <U+2014>some originating from [[Old Turkic]] or derived by TDK, and some borrowed from Arabic, Persian, or one of the European languages, especially [[French language|French]]<U+2014> having exactly the same literal meaning are used to express slightly different meanings, especially when speaking about abstract subjects, giving rise to a situation quite like the coexistence of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words and words originating from [[Romance languages]] in English.

Among some of the old words that were replaced are terms in [[geometry]], [[cardinal directions]], some months' names and many nouns and adjectives. Some examples of modern Turkish words and the old loanwords are:

[[Image:Ataturk Alfabe.gif|thumb|right|200px|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Atat<U+00FC>rk]] introducing the new [[Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Sivas]]. September 20, 1928]]
Turkish is written using the [[Turkish alphabet]], a modified version of the [[Latin alphabet]], which was introduced in [[1928]] by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] as an important step in the [[Atat<U+00FC>rk's Reforms|cultural reforms]] of the period, replacing the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] previously in use. The work of preparing the new alphabet and selecting the necessary modifications to account for sounds specific to Turkish language, was appointed to the ''Dil Enc<U+00FC>meni'' (Language Commission) including Falih R<U+0131>fk<U+0131> Atay, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano<U+011F>lu]], Ru<U+015F>en E<U+015F>ref <U+00DC>nayd<U+0131>n, Ahmet Cevat Emre, Rag<U+0131>p Hul<U+00FB>si <U+00D6>zdem, Faz<U+0131>l Ahmet Ayka<U+00E7>, Mehmet Emin Eri<U+015F>irgil and <U+0130>hsan Sungu. The introduction of the new Turkish alphabet was supported by ''Public Education Centers'' opened throughout the country, cooperation with publishing companies, and encouragement by Atat<U+00FC>rk himself in trips to the countryside teaching the new letters to the public<ref name="Dilacar">{{cite journal|last=Dila<U+00E7>ar|first=Agop|authorlink=Agop Dila<U+00E7>ar|title=Atat<U+00FC>rk ve Yaz<U+0131>m|journal=T<U+00FC>rk Dili|volume=35|issue=307|url=http://www.dildernegi.org.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFC3C6D81741DBEB05|format=HTML|accessdate=2007-03-19|year=1977}}</ref>.

The Turkish spelling is highly [[Phonetic spelling|phonetic]], and the sounds of the individual letters exhibit few surprises for English speakers. Following [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] conventions on [[phonetic transcription]], [[angle bracket]]s < > here are used to enclose written letters, and [[bracket]]s [ ] are used to enclose symbols that represent the sounds. Most writing-sound correspondences can be predicted by English speakers, with the following exceptions. The <c> denotes {{IPA|/d<U+0292>/}}, like <j> in English ''jail''. The <<U+00E7>> denotes {{IPA|/t<U+0283>/}} like the <ch> in English ''church''. The <j> represents {{IPA|/<U+0292>/}} like the <nowiki><g></nowiki> in ''rouge'', it is identical to [[French language|French]] <j> and is almost entirely used in loanwords of French origin. The <<U+015F>> represents {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}} like the <sh> in ''sheet''. The <<U+0131>> represents {{IPA|/<U+0268>/}}, a sound which does not exist in English. The <<U+011F>> denotes {{IPA|/<U+0263>/}} which may be manifested by lengthening the precedent vowel and assimilating any subsequent vowel (''e.g.'', ''so<U+011F>uk'' ("cold") is pronounced {{IPA|[souk]}})<U+2014>except for the two highly irregularly spelled verbs ''d<U+00F6><U+011F>mek'' ("to hit") and ''<U+00F6><U+011F>mek'' ("to praise"), where <<U+011F>> denotes {{IPA|[v]}}.

The effect of Atat<U+00FC>rk's introduction of the adapted Roman alphabet was a dramatic increase in literacy from Third World levels to nearly one hundred percent. It is critical to note that, for the first time, Turkish had an alphabet that was actually suited to the sounds of the language; the Arabic alphabet, which was hitherto in use, commonly shows only three different values for vowels (the consonants ''waw'' and ''yud'', atop which the long 'u' and 'i' sounds, respectively, are occasionally multiplexed, and the ''alif'', which can carry long medial 'a' or any initial vowel). It lacked several vital consonants, and on the other hand had redundancies with several other consonant sounds such as /z/ (these letters were pronounced differently in Arabic but were conflated in Turkish). The lack of discrimination among vowels is serviceable in Arabic (which sports few vowel sounds to begin with) but intolerable in Turkish, which features eight fundamental vowel sounds.
