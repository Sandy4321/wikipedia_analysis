'''''Night of the Living Dead''''' is a 1968 [[black-and-white]] [[independent film|independent]] [[horror film]] directed by [[George A. Romero]]. Early drafts of the script were titled '''''Monster Flick''''', but it was known as '''''Night of [[Anubis]]''''' and '''''Night of the Flesh Eaters''''' during production. The film stars [[Duane Jones]] as Ben and [[Judith O'Dea]] as Barbra.<ref>Please note that the character's name is spelled ''Barbra'' in the credits, not ''Barbara''.</ref> The plot revolves around the mysterious [[Corporeal reanimation|reanimation]] of the dead and the efforts of Ben, Barbra, and five others to survive the night while trapped in a [[rural]] [[Pennsylvania]] farmhouse.  

Romero produced the film on the low budget of $114,000, but after a decade of theatrical re-releases it had grossed an estimated $12 million in the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]] and $30 million internationally.<ref name="VH1">''Night of the Living Dead'' at [http://www.vh1.com/movies/movie/24972/plot.jhtml VH1.com].</ref><ref name="IMDbbusiness">Business data for the film at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/business Internet Movie Database], however, places the box office gross of $12 million at January 2000, not 1979.</ref> Reviewers criticized the graphic contents, but three decades later the [[Library of Congress]] placed ''Night of the Living Dead'' on the United States [[National Film Registry]] with other films deemed "historically, culturally or aesthetically important."<ref name ="CNN">"U.S. film registry adds 25 new titles," November 16, 1999, at [http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9911/16/natl.film.registry/ CNN].</ref>

== Plot ==
{{spoiler}}
<!-- PLEASE help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot does not need to appear here. PLEASE help keep prose encyclopedic. -->

Bickering siblings Johnny ([[Russell Streiner]]) and Barbra drive to a rural Pennsylvania [[cemetery]] to place a wreath on their father's grave. Johnny teases his sister, who is afraid of cemeteries, taunting, "They're coming to get you, Barbra!" A pale-faced man, ([[S. William Hinzman]]), lumbers toward the pair. The man suddenly grabs Barbra and Johnny rushes to save her. While fighting the man, Johnny falls and smashes his head on a gravestone. Barbra flees in Johnny's car, driving it into a tree. She runs into a nearby farmhouse to hide and soon discovers that others like the man are outside. 

[[Image:Judith O'Dea clutching grave in Night of the Living Dead bw.jpg|left|thumb|179px|Barbra ([[Judith O'Dea]]) flees from a mysterious attacker in the cemetery.]]In the abandoned house, Barbra is joined by Ben, who arrives in a [[pickup truck]] and attacks the mysterious figures with a [[tire iron]]. Ben boards up the doors and windows from the inside with dismantled furniture and scraps of wood as Barbra becomes [[hysterical]]. Ben finds a rifle and a radio as Barbra lies incapacitated on a couch in the living room. The two are unaware that Harry and Helen Cooper ([[Karl Hardman]] and [[Marilyn Eastman]]), their daughter Karen (Kyra Schon), and teenage couple Tom ([[Keith Wayne (actor)|Keith Wayne]]) and Judy ([[Judith Ridley]]) have been hiding in the [[cellar]]. One of the attackers bit Karen earlier and she has fallen ill. The group reluctantly cooperates to reinforce the house, but constant arguing between Ben and Harry hamper their efforts.

Radio reports explain that an epidemic of [[mass murder]] is sweeping across the [[eastern seaboard]] of the [[United States]]. Later, Ben discovers a television set upstairs and the [[Emergency Broadcast System|emergency broadcaster]] reveals that the murderers are consuming their victims' flesh.  A subsequent broadcast reports that the murders are being perpetrated by the recently deceased who have returned to life. Experts&mdash;scientists and military generals&mdash;are not sure of the cause of the reanimation, but one scientist is certain that it is the result of [[Radioactive contamination|radiation]] emanating from a [[Venus]] [[space probe]] that exploded in the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. A final report instructs that a gunshot or heavy blow to the head will stop the "living dead" and that [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]s of armed men are patroling the countryside to restore order.

[[Image:Zombies NightoftheLivingDead.jpg|right|thumb|The living dead.]]Ben devises a plan to escape using his truck but it needs refueling. He exits the house armed with the rifle and a torch. Tom and Judy offer assistance, but when they arrive at a fuel pump near the house Ben accidentally sets the gasoline ablaze with his torch. The truck explodes with Tom and Judy inside. Ben runs back to the house to find that Harry locked him out. He kicks the door open and punches Harry repeatedly. Some of the living dead begin eating Tom and Judy's charred remains, the others try to break through the doors and windows of the house. Ben manages to hold them back, but drops his rifle. Harry quickly seizes the fallen rifle and turns it on Ben. Ben wrests the rifle away from Harry and shoots him. Harry stumbles into the cellar and dies. 

Shortly thereafter, Helen discovers that her daughter has been transformed into one of the living dead and is consuming her father's corpse. Karen stabs her mother with a [[trowel|cement trowel]], killing her, before going upstairs. Meanwhile, the undead finally break into the house. Barbra sees her brother Johnny in the mass. The resultant shock causes her to lower her defenses and she is carried away into the crowd. Ben rushes into the cellar and shoots the reanimated Harry and Helen Cooper. In the morning, a posse approaches the house and kill the remaining zombies. Hearing the commotion, Ben ambles up the cellar stairs into the living room and is shot in the head by a posse member who mistakes him for a zombie. His body is carried from the house and burned with zombie corpses.

== Production ==

While attending [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], George A. Romero embarked upon his career in the [[film industry]]. In the 1960s, he directed and produced television commercials and [[industrial films]] for The Latent Image, a company he co-founded with friends [[John Russo]] and [[Russell Streiner]]. During this period, the trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie. According to Romero, they wanted to capitalize on the film industry's "thirst for the bizarre."<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> He and Streiner contacted [[Karl Hardman]] and [[Marilyn Eastman]], president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman Associates, Inc., and pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Convinced by Romero, a production company called Image Ten was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman, and Eastman. Image Ten raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.<ref name="RomeroPreface">George A.

[[Image:Boscosyrup.jpg|left|thumb|[[Marilyn Eastman]] applying [[Bosco Chocolate Syrup]] to [[Karl Hardman]] for a bloody special effect.]]The small budget dictated much of the production process. According to Hardman, "We knew that we could not raise enough money to shoot a film on a par with the classic horror films with which we had all grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot."<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Scenes were filmed near [[Evans City, Pennsylvania]], thirty miles north of Pittsburgh in rural [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler County]]; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery.<ref>Neil Fawcett, "Evans Cemetery: Then and Now" at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/baps/evans_cemetary.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref><ref>Alan Jones,however, mistakenly cites the [[Allegheny Cemetery]] on Butler Street in Pittsburgh as the filming location. Alan Jones, ''The Rough Guide to Horror Movies'' (New York: Rough Guides, 2005), p. 118, ISBN 1843535211.</ref> 

[[Special effect]]s were fairly simple and likewise limited by the budget. The blood, for example, was [[Bosco Chocolate Syrup]] drizzled over cast members' bodies.<ref>"The Filming" of ''Night of the Living Dead'' at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/filming.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Wardrobes consisted of second-hand clothing and [[adipocere]] ([[mortician]]'s wax) served as zombie makeup. Marilyn Eastman supervised the special effects, wardrobe, and makeup.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> 

Filming took place between June and December of 1967 under the working title ''Night of Anubis'' and later ''Night of the Flesh Eaters''.<ref name="FrightfulFacts">"Frightful Facts" at [http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm House of Horrors].</ref><ref name="IMDbbusiness">Business Data for ''Night of the Living Dead'' at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/business Internet Movie Database].</ref> The small budget led Romero to shoot on [[35 mm|35&nbsp;mm]] black-and-white film. The completed film ultimately benefited from the decision, as film historian Joseph Maddrey describes the black-and-white filming as "[[Guerilla filmmaking|guerilla]]-style" and resembling "the unflinching authority of a wartime [[newsreel]]." Maddrey adds, it "seem[s] as much like a documentary on the loss of social stability as an [[exploitation film]]." <ref>Joseph Maddrey, ''Nightmares in Red, White and Blue: The Evolution of the American Horror Film'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 51, ISBN 0786418605.</ref> 

Members of Image Ten were personally involved in filming and [[Film editing|post-production]], participating in loading [[camera magazine]]s, [[Gaffer|gaffing]], constructing props, recording sounds, and editing.<ref name="RomeroPreface">Romero, ''Complete Night of the Living Dead Filmbook''.</ref> Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated in an interview that a "number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints as I made the exposures. As I recall, I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production."<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref>

Upon the completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] and [[American International Pictures]] declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers.<ref>Jason Paul Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's: Interviews with 20 Cult Film Actresses'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 4, ISBN 0786418184.</ref> Romero admitted that "none of us wanted to do that.

=== Writing ===

Co-written as a [[horror comedy]] by John Russo and George Romero under the title ''Monster Flick'', an early screenplay draft concerned the exploits of teenage [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]]  who visit Earth and befriend human teenagers. A second version of the script featured a young man who runs away from home and discovers rotting human corpses that aliens use for food scattered across a meadow. The final draft, written mainly by Romero over three days in 1967, focused on reanimated human corpses&mdash;Romero refers to them as ''[[ghouls]]''&mdash;that feast on the flesh of the living.<ref name="Treatment">John A. Russo, ''The Complete Night of the Living Dead Filmbook'' (Pittsburgh: Imagine, Inc., 1985), ISBN 0911137033, quoted in "Treatment/Original Script," Bonus Materials, ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition (DVD, Elite Entertainment, 2002), [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2 ASIN B00005Y6Y2].</ref> In a 1997 interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''Forbidden Weekend'', Romero explained that the script developed into a three-part [[short story]]. Part one became ''Night of the Living Dead''. Sequels ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978) and ''[[Day of the Dead (film)|Day of the Dead]]'' (1985) were adapted from the two remaining parts.<ref>George A. Romero interview, ''Forbidden Weekend'', February 2, 1997, available [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/baps/bbc_interview.html here].</ref>
 
Romero drew inspiration from [[Richard Matheson]]'s ''[[I Am Legend]]'' (1954), a [[horror fiction|horror/science fiction novel]] about a [[Epidemic|plague]] that ravages a futuristic [[Los Angeles]] in the 1970s. The deceased in ''I Am Legend'' return to life and prey on the uninfected.<ref name="RomeroPreface">Romero, ''Complete Night of the Living Dead Filmbook''.</ref><ref>Richard Matheson, ''I Am Legend'' (1954; New York: Orb Books, 1995), ISBN 031286504X.</ref><ref>Marco Lanzagorta, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition DVD, at [http://popmatters.com/film/reviews/n/night-of-the-living-dead-millennium.shtml Pop Matters].</ref> Film adaptations of Matheson's novel appeared in 1964 as ''[[The Last Man on Earth]]'' and in 1971 as ''[[The Omega Man]]''. Matheson was not impressed by Romero's interpretation, telling an interviewer, "It was ... kind of cornball."<ref>Richard Matheson interview, in Tom Weaver, ''Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1999), p. 307, ISBN 0786407557.</ref>

Russo and Romero revised the screenplay while filming. Karl Hardman attributed the edits to lead actor Duane Jones: "The script had been written with the character Ben as a rather simple truck driver. His dialogue was that of a lower class/uneducated person. Duane Jones was a very well educated man ... [and he] simply refused to do the role as it was written. As I recall, I believe that Duane himself upgraded his own dialogue to reflect how he felt the character should present himself."  The cellar scenes featuring dialogue between Helen and Harry Cooper were modified as well by Marilyn Eastman.<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref>

According to lead actress Judith O'Dea, much of the dialogue was [[Improvisational theatre|improvised]]. She told an interviewer, "I don't know if there was an actual working script! We would go over what basically had to be done, then just did it the way we each felt it ''should'' be done."<ref name="O'Deainterview">Judith O'Dea interview, in Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 4.</ref> One example offered by O'Dea concerns a scene where Barbra tells Ben about Johnny's death: <blockquote>''The sequence where Ben is breaking up the table to block the entrance and I'm on the couch and start telling him the story of what happened [to Johnny] ... it's all [[ad-lib]]bed. This is what we want to get across ... tell the story about me and Johnny in the car and me being attacked. That was it ... all improv. We filmed it once. There was a concern we didn't get the sound right, but fortunately they were able to use it.''<ref name="O'Deainterview">Judith O'Dea interview, in Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 4.</ref></blockquote>

=== Casting ===
The limited budget curtailed the ability of Image Ten to hire well-known actors. The cast consisted of Pittsburgh stage actors, members of the Image Ten production crew, and acquaintances of Romero. Involvement in the film propelled many cast members into the motion picture industry.[[Image:Duane Jones as Ben in Night of the Living Dead bw.jpg|thumb|179px|right|[[Duane Jones]] as Ben.]]

The lead role of Ben went to unknown [[African American]] stage actor [[Duane Jones]]. His performance depicted Ben as a "comparatively calm and resourceful [[Negro]]," according to one reviewer.<ref>Kevin Thomas, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Los Angeles ''Times'', January 10, 1969, reprinted in ''The A-List: The National Society of Film Critics' 100 Essential Films'', ed. Jay Carr (Cambridge, Mass.: Da Capo Press, 2002), p. 199, ISBN 0306810964.</ref> Casting Jones was potentially controversial. In the mid-twentieth century it was unusual for a black man to play the hero in a film that starred white actors, and commentators saw Romero's choice of Jones as significant. Romero, on the other hand, said that Jones "simply gave the best audition."<ref name="Romeroquote">George A. Romero, quoted in Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror Movies'', p. 118.</ref> After ''Night of the Living Dead'', he co-starred in ''[[Ganja and Hess]]'' (1973), ''[[Vampires (1986 film)|Vampires]]'' (1986), ''[[Negatives (film)|Negatives]]'' (1988), and ''[[To Die For (1989 film)|To Die For]]'' (1989) before his death in 1988.<ref>Duane Jones at the [http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0427977/ Internet Movie Database].</ref> Despite his other film roles, Jones worried that people only recognized him as Ben.<ref>Duane Jones interview, Bonus Materials, ''Night of the Living Dead'', Millennium Edition (DVD, Elite Entertainment, 2002).</ref>

Image Ten cast 23-year-old commercial and stage actor [[Judith O'Dea]] as the waifish Barbra. Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman contacted O'Dea, who had once worked for them in Pittsburgh, to audition for the part. O'Dea was in [[Hollywood]] searching for a break-out role in motion pictures. She remarked in an interview that starring in the film was a positive experience for her, although she admitted that horror movies terrified her, particularly [[Vincent Price]]'s ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' (1953). Besides acting, O'Dea performed her own stunts which she jokingly says amounted to "lots of running." Assessing ''Night of the Living Dead'', she states "I honestly had no idea it would have such a lasting impact on our culture." She was just as surprised by the notoriety the film brought her: "People treat you differently. [I'm] [[ho-hum]] Judy O'Dea until they realize [I'm] Barbara [''sic''] from ''Night of the Living Dead''. All of a sudden [I'm] not so ho-hum anymore!"<ref name="O'Deainterview">O'Dea interview, p. 4.</ref> Following ''Night of the Living Dead'', O'Dea appeared in the television film ''The Pirate'' (1978) and feature films ''[[Claustrophobia (film)|Claustrophobia]]'' (2003), ''[[October Moon]]'' (2005) and ''[[The Ocean (film)|The Ocean]]'' (2006).<ref>Judith O'Dea at the [http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0640621/ Internet Movie Database].</ref>

The supporting cast had no experience in the film industry prior to ''Night of the Living Dead''. The role of Tom remained [[Keith Wayne (actor)|Keith Wayne]]'s only film role (he committed [[suicide]] in 1995),<ref>Keith Wayne at the [http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0915593/ Internet Movie Database].</ref> but [[Judith Ridley]] co-starred in Romero's ''[[There's Always Vanilla]]'' (1971).<ref>Judith Ridley at the [http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0725985/ Internet Movie Database].</ref> The cemetery zombie who kills Johnny in the first scene was played by [[S. William Hinzman]], a role that launched his horror film career. Hinzman was later involved in the films ''[[Season of the Witch]]'' (1973), ''[[Flesheater]]'' (1988), ''[[Legion of the Night]]'' (1995), ''[[Santa Claws]]'' (1996), and ''[[Evil Ambitions]]'' (1996).<ref>S. William Hinzman at the [http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0386100/ Internet Movie Database].</ref>

Image Ten members [[Karl Hardman]], [[Marilyn Eastman]], and [[Russell Streiner]] performed prominent acting roles. Hardman and Eastman co-starred as Harry and Helen Cooper (Eastman also played the female zombie who plucks an insect off a tree and eats it) while Streiner played Johnny, Barbra's brother. Hardman's eleven-year-old daughter, Kyra Schon, played the role of Karen Cooper. Image Ten's [[production manager]], George Kosana, played Sheriff McClelland.<ref>Full Cast and Crew for ''Night of the Living Dead'' at the [http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/fullcredits Internet Movie Database].</ref>

Romero's friends and acquaintances were recruited as zombie [[Extra (actor)|extras]]. Romero stated, "We had a film company doing commercials and industrial films so there were a lot of people from the advertising game who all wanted to come out and be zombies, and a lot of them did."  He adds amusingly, "Some people from around Evans City who just thought it was a goof came out to get caked in makeup and lumber around."<ref>George A. Romero interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/zombies.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref>

=== Directing ===

''Night of the Living Dead'' was the first feature-length film directed by George A. Romero. His initial work involved filming [[Short subject|short]]s for Pittsburgh public broadcaster [[WQED (TV)|WQED]]'s children's series ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]''.<ref name="DOD">George A. Romero interview, quoted at "George A. Romero Bio", Special Features, ''Dawn of the Dead'', Special Divimax Edition (DVD, Anchor Bay, 2004), [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001611DI/ ASIN B0001611DI].</ref><ref>George A.

He took the helm of the sequels as well as ''Season of the Witch'', ''[[The Crazies]]'' (1973), ''[[Martin (film)|Martin]]'' (1977), ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), and ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993).<ref>George A. Romero biography at [http://www.horrordirectors.com/georgeromero.html HorrorDirectors.com].</ref>[[Image:GeorgeARomero WOH Muenster 2005.jpg|left|thumb|[[George A. Romero]], director and co-writer of ''Night of the Living Dead''.]]

Critics saw the influence of the horror and science-fiction films of the 1950s in Romero's directorial style. Stephen Paul Miller, for instance, witnessed "a revival of fifties schlock shock ... and the army general's television discussion of military operations in the film echoes the often inevitable calling-in of the army in fifties horror films." Miller admits, however, that "''Night of the Living Dead'' takes greater relish in mocking these military operations through the general's pompous demeanor" and the government's inability to source the zombie epidemic or protect the citizenry.<ref>Stephen Paul Miller, ''The Seventies Now: Culture as Surveillance'' (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1999), p. 81, ISBN 0822321661.</ref>

Romero describes the mood he wished to establish: "The film opens with a situation that has already disintegrated to a point of little hope, and it moves progressively toward absolute despair and ultimate tragedy."<ref>George A. Romero, quoted in Royer, ''The Spectacle Of Isolation,'' p. 15.</ref> According to film historian Carl Royer, Romero "employs [[chiaroscuro]], [[Film noir|noir]]-style lighting to emphasize humanity's nightmare alienation from itself."<ref>Carl Royer, ''The Spectacle Of Isolation In Horror Films: Dark Parades'' Binghamton, N.Y.: Haworth Press, 2005), p. 15, ISBN 0789022648.</ref>  

While some critics dismissed Romero's film because of the graphic scenes, writer [[R. H. W. Dillard]] claimed that the "open-eyed detailing" of [[taboo]] served to heighten the film's success. He asks, "What girl has not, at one time or another, wished to kill her mother? And Karen, in the film, offers a particularly vivid opportunity to commit the forbidden deed vicariously."<ref>R. H. W. Dillard, "''Night of the Living Dead'': It's Not Like Just a Wind That's Passing Through," in ''American Horrors: Essays on the Modern American Horror Film'', ed. Gregory A. Waller (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), p. 15, ISBN 0252014480.</ref>

Romero featured human taboos as key themes, particularly [[cannibalism]]. Although zombie cannibals were inspired by Matheson's ''I Am Legend'', film historian Robin Wood sees the flesh-eating scenes of ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a [[1960s|late 1960s]] critique of American [[capitalism]]. Wood asserts that the zombies represent capitalists, and "cannibalism represents the ultimate in possessiveness, hence the logical end of human relations under capitalism."  He argues that the zombies' victims symbolized the repression of "[[Other|the Other]]" in [[bourgeois]] American society, namely [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights activist]]s, [[Second-wave feminism|feminist]]s, [[homosexual]]s, and [[Counterculture|counterculturalist]]s in general.<ref>Robin Wood, "An Introduction to the American Horror Film," in ''Movies and Methods'', Vol. II, ed. Bill Nichols (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985), p. 213, ISBN 0520054091.</ref>

=== Music and sound effects ===

The eerie and disturbing score of ''Night of the Living Dead'' was not composed for the film. Karl Hardman told an interviewer that the music came from Hardman Associates's extensive film music library. According to Hardman, "I chose a selection of music for each of the various scenes and then George made the final selections. I then, took those selections and augmented them electronically."<ref name="Hardman/Eastmaninterview">Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman interview, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/interviews_1.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Hardman's choices worked well, as Film historian Sumiko Higashi believes that music "signif[ies] the nature of events that await."<ref>Sumiko Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead'': A Horror Film about the Horrors of the Vietnam Era," in ''From Hanoi to Hollywood: The Vietnam War in American Film'', ed. Linda Dittmar and Gene Michaud (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1990), p. 182, ISBN 0813515874.</ref>

Sound effects were created by Hardman and Marilyn Eastman: "Marilyn and I recorded all of the live sound effects used in the film (two 10 inch reels of edited tape)." Hardman recalled, "Of all the sound effects that we created, the one that still gives me goose bumps when I hear it, is Marilyn's screaming as [Helen Cooper] is killed by her daughter. Judy O'Dea's screaming is a close second.

''Night of the Living Dead'' premiered on [[October 1]], [[1968]], at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh.<ref name="Collum3">Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 3.</ref> Nationally, it was shown as a Saturday afternoon matin<U+00E9>e&mdash;as was typical for horror films of the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;and attracted an audience consisting of [[pre-teen]]s and [[adolescent]]s.<ref>[[Stephen King]], ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (New York: Berkley Books, 1983), pp. 1-9, ISBN 0425104338.</ref><ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 6, 196[9], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 RogerEbert.com].</ref> The [[MPAA film rating system]] was not in place in 1968, so theater managers did not prohibit even young children from purchasing tickets. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film. "I don't think the younger kids really knew what hit them," complained Ebert. "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately:<blockquote>''The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.''<ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 6, 196[9], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 RogerEbert.com].</ref></blockquote>

''Night of the Living Dead'' was awarded two distinguished honors thirty years after the debut.

=== Criticism ===

The gory special effects featured in the film were disliked by reviewers. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' labeled ''Night of the Living Dead'' an "unrelieved orgy of [[sadism]]" and questioned the "integrity and social responsibility of its Pittsburgh-based makers."<ref>''Variety'', review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', October 15, 1968, quoted in Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''", p. 184.</ref> ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Vincent Canby]] referred to the film as a "junk movie" as well as "spare, uncluttered, but really silly."<ref>Vincent Canby, "Getting Beyond Myra and The Valley of the Junk," New York ''Times'', July 5, 1970, p. 49.</ref> 

Nevertheless, some reviewers recognized the film as groundbreaking. [[Pauline Kael]] called the film "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made&mdash;and when you leave the theatre you may wish you could forget the whole horrible experience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The film's grainy, banal seriousness works for it&mdash;gives it a crude realism[.]"<ref name="Kael">Pauline Kael, ''5001 Nights at the Movies'' (Henry Holt and Company, 1991), ISBN 0805013679.</ref> A ''Film Daily'' critic commented, "This is a pearl of a horror picture which exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper."<ref>''Film Daily'', review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', quoted in Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''," p. 175.</ref> While Roger Ebert criticized the matin<U+00E9>e screening, he admitted that he "admire[s] the movie itself."<ref name="Ebertreview">Roger Ebert, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', Chicago ''Sun-Times'', January 6, 196[9], at [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 RogerEbert.com].</ref> Critic [[Rex Reed]] wrote, "If you want to see what turns a [[B movie]] into a classic ... don't miss ''Night of the Living Dead''. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it."<ref>Rex Reed, quoted at [http://www.houseofhorrors.com/night68.htm House of Horrors].</ref>

Since the release, critics and film historians have seen ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international [[Cold War]] politics, and domestic [[racism]]. Elliot Stein of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' saw the film as an ardent critique of American involvement in Vietnam, arguing that it "was not [set in] [[Transylvania]], but Pennsylvania&mdash;this was [[Middle America]] at war, and the zombie carnage seemed a grotesque echo of the conflict then raging in [[Vietnam]]."<ref name="Steinreview">Elliot Stein, "The Dead Zones: 'George A. Romero' at the American Museum of the Moving Image," ''The Village Voice'' (New York), 8-14 January, 2003, available [http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0302,stein,41018,20.html here].</ref> Film historian Sumiko Higashi concurs, arguing that ''Night of the Living Dead'' was a horror film about the horrors of the Vietnam era. While she asserts that "there are no Vietnamese in ''Night of the Living Dead'', ... they constitute an absent presence whose significance can be understood if narrative is construed." She points to aspects of the Vietnam War paralleled in the film: grainy black-and-white newsreels, [[search-and-destroy]] operations, helicopters, and graphic carnage.<ref>Higashi, "''Night of the Living Dead''," p. 181.</ref>

Ben puts slippers on her feet as she is [[catatonic]].]]While George Romero denies he hired Duane Jones simply because he was black, reviewer Mark Deming notes that "the grim fate of Duane Jones, the sole heroic figure and only African-American, had added resonance with the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]] and [[Malcolm X]] fresh in the minds of most Americans."<ref>Mark Deming, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', at [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:35311 All Movie Guide].</ref><ref name="RomeroJones">George A.

Romero' at the American Museum of the Moving Image," ''The Village Voice'' (New York), 8-14 January, 2003, available [http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0302,stein,41018,20.html here].</ref> The deaths of Ben, Barbra, and the supporting cast offered audiences an uncomfortable, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] glimpse unusual for the genre.<ref>Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror'', pp. 117-118.</ref>

The treatment of female characters attracted criticism from [[feminist]] scholars and critics. Women are portrayed as helpless and often excluded from the decision-making process by the male characters. Barbra suffers a psychological breakdown so severe after the loss of her brother that she is reduced to a semi-[[catatonic]] state for much of the film. Judy is portrayed in an extreme state of denial, leading to her own death and that of her boyfriend. Helen Cooper, while initially strong-willed, becomes immobilized and dies as a result.<ref name="Grant">Barry Keith Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead'': George Romero, Feminism, and the Horror Film," in ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', ed.

Other prevalent themes included "[[disillusionment]] with government and [[patriarchal]] [[nuclear family]]"<ref name="Steinreview">Elliot Stein, "The Dead Zones: 'George A.

Waller, Introduction to ''American Horrors'', p. 4.</ref> Film historian Linda Badley explains that the film was so horrifying because the monsters were not creatures from [[Outer Space]] or some exotic environment, "They're us."<ref>Linda Badley, ''Film, Horror, and the Body Fantastic'' (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995), p. 25, ISBN 0313275238.</ref> Romero confessed that the film was designed to reflect the tensions of the time: "It was 1968, man. Everybody had a 'message'. The anger and attitude and all that's there is just because it was the [[Sixties]]. We lived at the farmhouse, so we were always into raps about the implication and the meaning, so some of that crept in."<ref name="RomeroJones">George A. Romero, quoted in Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror Movies'', p. 118.</ref>

=== Influence ===

George Romero revolutionized the horror film industry with ''Night of the Living Dead''. According to Almar Haflidason of the BBC, the film represented "a new dawn in horror film-making."<ref>Almar Haflidason, review of ''Night of the Living Dead'', March 20, 2001, at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/20/night_of_the_living_dead_1968_review.shtml BBC.co.uk].</ref> Early films that featured [[zombie]]s such as [[Victor Halperin]]'s ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), [[Jacques Tourneur]]'s ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), and [[John Gilling]]'s ''[[The Plague of the Zombies]]'' (1966) involved living human zombies enslaved by a [[Voodoo]] [[witch doctor]]; many were set in the [[Caribbean]]. Although the word ''zombie'' is never used, Romero's film introduced the theme of zombies as reanimated, flesh-eating cannibals who spread their condition through biting.<ref>Andrew Tudor, ''Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie'' (Oxford, Eng.: Blackwell Publishing, 1989), p. 101, ISBN 063116992X.</ref><ref name="Collum3">Collum, ''Assault of the Killer B's'', p. 3.</ref>

The film spawned countless imitators that borrowed elements instituted by Romero: ''[[Tombs of the Blind Dead]]'' (1971), ''[[Zombi 2|Zombie]]'' (1979), ''[[Hell of the Living Dead]]'' (1980), ''[[Night of the Comet]]'' (1982), ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]'' (1985), ''[[Night of the Creeps]]'' (1986), ''[[Children of the Living Dead]]'' (2001), and the video game series ''[[Resident Evil (series)|Resident Evil]]'' (later adapted as films in [[Resident Evil (film)|2002]], [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|2004]], and [[Resident Evil: Extinction|2007]]). ''Night of the Living Dead'' is [[parody|parodied]] in films such as ''[[Night of the Living Bread]]'' (1990) and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' (2004) and in episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' ("[[Treehouse of Horror III]]", 1992) and ''[[South Park]]'' ("[[Pink Eye (South Park episode)|Pink Eye]]", 1997).<ref>Rockoff, ''Going to Pieces'', p. 36.</ref><ref>"Treehouse of Horror III," episode 64, ''The Simpsons'', October 29, 1992, at the [http://imdb.com/title/tt0758368/ Internet Movie Database].</ref><ref>"Pink Eye," episode 107, ''South Park'', October 29, 1997, on ''South Park: The Complete First Season'' (DVD, Warner Bros., 2002)</ref>

''Night of the Living Dead'' ushered in the [[slasher film|slasher]] and [[splatter film]] sub-genres. As one film historian points out, horror prior to Romero's film had mostly involved rubber masks and costumes, cardboard sets, or mysterious figures lurking in the shadows. They were set in locations far removed from rural and [[suburban]] America.<ref>Jones, ''Rough Guide to Horror'', p. 117.</ref> Romero revealed the power behind [[exploitation film|exploitation]] and setting horror in ordinary, unexceptional locations and offered a template for making an "effective and lucrative" film on a "miniscule budget."<ref name="Rockoff">Adam Rockoff, ''Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986'' (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2002), p. 35, ISBN 0786412275.</ref> Slasher films of the 1980s such as [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), [[Sean S. Cunningham]]'s ''[[Friday the 13th (film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980), and [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), for example, "owe much to the original ''Night of the Living Dead''."<ref>Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead''," p. 201.</ref>

== Revisions ==

[[Image:Off Color Films Feast of the Living Dead colorized.JPG|right|thumb|The flesh-eating scenes appear more graphic in the [[film colorization|colorized]] versions of the film.]]The first revisions of ''Night of the Living Dead'' involved [[film colorization|colorization]] by home video distributors. [[Hal Roach|Hal Roach Studios]] released a colorized version in the 1980s that featured green zombies. Another colorized version appeared in 1997 from [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] with flesh-colored zombies.<ref>''Night of the Living Dead'' (VHS, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 1997), [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301231864/ ASIN 6301231864].</ref> In 2004, [[Legend Films]] produced a colorized version for distribution by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>''Night of the Living Dead'' (DVD, 20th Century Fox, 2004), [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQLGM/ ASIN B0002IQLGM].</ref><ref>Alternate Versions of ''Night of the Living Dead'' at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063350/alternateversions Internet Movie Database].</ref>

The magazine, however, quoted Romero as saying, "I didn't want to touch ''Night of the Living Dead''."<ref>''Entertainment Weekly'', quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night30/index.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref> Critics panned the revised film, notably [[Harry Knowles]] of ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]''.

The film has been [[remake|remade]] twice. The first, debuting in 1990, was directed by special effects artist [[Tom Savini]]. [[Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)|The remake]] was based on the original screenplay, but included more gore and a revised plot that portrayed Barbara<ref>The character's name is spelled ''Barbara'' in the remake, not ''Barbra''.</ref> ([[Patricia Tallman]]) as a heroine. Film historian Barry Grant saw the new Barbara as a corrective on the part of Romero. He suggests that the character was made stronger to rectify the depiction of female characters in the original film.<ref name="Grant">Barry Keith Grant, "Taking Back the ''Night of the Living Dead'': George Romero, Feminism, and the Horror Film," in ''The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film'', ed. Barry K. Grant (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1996), ISBN 0292727941.</ref> The second remake was filmed in [[3-D film|3-D]] format and scheduled for release in September 2006 under the title ''[[Night of the Living Dead 3-D]]''. Directed by [[Jeff Broadstreet]], the characters and plot are similar to the 1968 original. Unlike Savini's 1990 film, Romero was not affiliated with Broadstreet's project.<ref>''Night of the Living Dead 3-D'' at the [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489244/ Internet Movie Database].</ref><ref>''Night of the Living Dead 3-D'' [http://www.nightofthelivingdead3d.com/ official site].</ref>

== Copyright status ==

''Night of the Living Dead'' lapsed into the [[public domain]] because of the neglect of the original theatrical distributor, the Walter Reade Organization, to place a [[copyright]] notice on the prints. In 1968, [[United States copyright law]] required a proper notice for a work to maintain a copyright. Image Ten displayed such a notice on the title frames of the film beneath the original title, ''Night of the Flesh Eaters''. The distributor removed the statement when it changed the title.<ref>United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Technology and the Law, ''Legal Issues that Arise when Color is Added to Films Originally Produced, Sold, and Distributed in Black and White'' (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 83.</ref> According to George Romero, the distributor "ripped us off."<ref>George A. Romero, quoted at [http://www.homepageofthedead.com/films/night/filming.html Homepage of the Dead].</ref>

Because of the public domain status, the film is sold on home video by several distributors. The [[Internet Movie Database]] lists 23 copies of ''Night of the Living Dead'' retailing on [[DVD]] and nineteen on [[VHS]].<ref>Merchandise for

== Sequels ==
{{main|Living Dead|Return of the Living Dead (film series)}}

''Night of the Living Dead'' constitutes the first film in a [[tetralogy]] directed by George Romero. Following the 1968 film, Romero released ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978), ''[[Day of the Dead (film)|Day of the Dead]]'' (1985), and ''[[Land of the Dead]]'' (2005). Each film traces the evolution of the zombie epidemic in the United States and humanity's desperate attempts to cope with it. As in ''Night of the Living Dead'', Romero peppered the other films in the series with critiques specific to the periods they were released.

The same year ''Day of the Dead'' premiered, ''Night of the Living Dead'' co-writer John Russo released a film titled ''[[Return of the Living Dead]]''. Russo's film offers an alternate [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] to the original film than ''Dawn of the Dead'', but acted more as a parody than a sequel. Russo's film spawned four [[Return of the Living Dead (film series)|sequels]].  The last&mdash;''[[Return of the Living Dead (film series)#Return of the Living Dead: Rave from the Grave|Return of the Living Dead: Rave from the Grave]]''&mdash;was released in 2005 as a [[television movie]].

''Return of the Living Dead'' sparked a legal battle with Romero, who believed Russo marketed his film in direct competition with ''Day of the Dead'' as a sequel to the original film. In the case ''Dawn Associates v. Links'' (1978), Romero accused Russo of "appropriat[ing] part of the title of the prior work," [[plagiarizing]] ''Dawn of the Dead'''s advertising slogan ("When there is no room in [[hell]] ... the dead will walk the earth"), and copying stills from the original 1968 film. Romero was ultimately granted a restraining order that forced Russo to cease his advertising campaign. Russo, however, was allowed to retain his title.<ref>Patrick J. Flinn, ''Handbook of Intellectual Property Claims and Remedies: 2004 Supplement'' (New York: Aspen Publishers, 1999), p. 24-25, ISBN 073551125X.</ref>
