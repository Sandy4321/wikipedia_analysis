'''Hurricane Ismael''' was a weak, but deadly [[Pacific hurricane]] that killed over one hundred people in northern [[Mexico]] in September of the [[1995 Pacific hurricane season]]. It developed from a persistent area of deep [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] on September 12, and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210&nbsp;miles (340&nbsp;km) off the coast of Mexico. It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]] it made landfall on [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h). Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. The remnants entered the [[United States]] and extended eastward into the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].

Offshore, Ismael produced waves of up to 30&nbsp;feet (9&nbsp;m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared for the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, and as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in mainland [[Mexico]] and resulted in $26&nbsp;million in damage (1995&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|26000000|1995|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000&nbsp;people homeless. Moisture from the storm extended into the [[United States]], causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern [[New Mexico]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Ismael 1995 track.png}}
A poorly organized area of convection persisted about {{convert|170|mi|km}} off the southern coast of [[Guatemala]] on September 9. It moved west-northwestward, and after three days without further organization a circulation developed off the southwest coast of [[Mexico]]. The system quickly organized, resulting in [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] beginning later that day. Convective [[rainbands|banding]] became better organized, and late on September 12 it developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located about {{convert|350|mi|km}} south-southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. The depression moved to the northwest, and following an increase in deep convection it intensified into Tropical Storm Ismael early on September 13.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Britt Max Mayfield|date=1995-11-19|title=Hurricane Ismael Tropical Cyclone Report|work=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2010-04-12|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995ismael.html}}</ref>

Ismael quickly developed a poorly defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], and six hours after becoming a hurricane it reached a peak intensity of {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Steered between a mid- to upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to its west and a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its east, Ismael accelerated as it moved just west of due north. Late on September 14 Ismael passed 65&nbsp;miles (100&nbsp;km) east of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. The hurricane maintained its strength as it continued northward, and made landfall on [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] on September 15. Ismael rapidly weakened as the circulation crossed the high terrain of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], and it dissipated early on September 16 about 55&nbsp;miles (95&nbsp;km) south of the Mexico/[[United States]] border. The remnants of Ismael continued northward, and moisture from the storm extended over the southwestern United States eastward through the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Initially, Hurricane Ismael was predicted to remain over the open waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. However, when a northward motion became apparent, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from [[Manzanillo, Colima]], to [[Cabo Corrientes]] and for the [[Islas Marias]]. Shortly thereafter, the warning was extended to [[Los Mochis]] and issued for the eastern coast of [[Baja California Sur]] south of 25<U+00B0> N. Ten hours before Ismael made its final landfall, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from [[Mazatl<U+00E1>n]] to [[Los Mochis]].<ref name="tcr"/> Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, 1,572&nbsp;people evacuated to five emergency shelters.<ref name="cndh">{{Cite web|author=El Presidente de la Comisi<U+00F3>n Nacional|date=1996-07-30|title=La Recomendaci<U+00F3>n 64/96, del 30 de julio de 1996 por Huracan Ismael|publisher=Comisi<U+00F3>n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos|language=Spanish|accessdate=2010-04-12|url=http://www.cndh.org.mx/recomen/1996/064.htm}}</ref>

==Impact==

Hurricane Ismael produced 30&nbsp;foot (9&nbsp;m) waves over the [[Gulf of California]] and coastal waters off of [[Mexico]]. The hurricane, which was forecast to move more slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared<ref name="ap1"/> due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities.<ref name="cndh"/> As a result 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore,<ref name="ismaelsp">{{cite web|author=Daniel Bitr<U+00E1>n Bitr<U+00E1>n|year=2001|title=Caracter<U+00E1>sticas del Impacto Socioecon<U+00F3>mico de los Principales Desastres Ocurridos en M<U+00E9>xico en el Per<U+00ED>odo 1980&nbsp;<U+2013> 99|publisher=Centro Nacional de Prevenci<U+00F3>n de Desastres|language=Spanish|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.proteccioncivil.gob.mx/upLoad/Publicaciones/ised_80_89.pdf}}</ref> with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded.

While moving through northwestern [[Mexico]], Hurricane Ismael dropped moderate to heavy rainfall including a state record of {{convert|7.76|in|mm}} in [[Sinaloa]], resulting in the flooding of four [[Municipalities of Sinaloa|municipalities]]. In one municipality, the passage of the hurricane destroyed 373 cardboard houses and damaged 4,790 others. The passage of the hurricane left 177 houses without drinking water and left four municipalities without power.<ref name="ismaelsp"/>
Damage was heaviest where the hurricane made landfall. In [[Los Mochis]], the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles, though no deaths were reported.<ref name="ap1"/> 59&nbsp;people were killed in Sinaloa.<ref name="cndh"/>

Ismael produced heavy rainfall further to the north, peaking at 10.9&nbsp;inches (276&nbsp;mm) in [[Sonora]]. Severe flooding was reported in [[Huatabampo]]. The hurricane directly affected 24,111&nbsp;people in 8 [[Municipalities of Sonora|municipalities]]. Throughout Sonora, the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs of 6,827 homes. The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state. The passage of Hurricane Ismael damaged high-tension power lines and cable lines, causing interruptions to the communication system. The hurricane also weakened 2,163&nbsp;miles (3,481&nbsp;km) of gravel roads and damaged about 100&nbsp;miles (165&nbsp;km) of paved highways. 250&nbsp;people lost their jobs in Sonora due to sunken or damaged fishing boats. In addition, about 83 sq. miles (215&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of crop lands were impacted. Damage in Sonora amounted to $8.6&nbsp;million (1995&nbsp;USD, $50&nbsp;million 1995 [[Mexican peso|MXN]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|50000000|1995|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD).<ref name="ismaelsp"/>

Throughout Mexico the hurricane left 30,000&nbsp;people homeless.<ref name="ss1"/> Including offshore casualties, Ismael caused at least 116 deaths and damage totaling to $26&nbsp;million (1995&nbsp;USD, $197&nbsp;million 1995 [[MXN]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|26000000|1995|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD).<ref name="cancun">{{cite web|author=Centro Nacional de Prevenci<U+00F3>n de Desastres|year=2006|title=Impacto Socioecon<U+00F3>mico de los Ciclones Tropicales 2005|language=Spanish|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.ine.gob.mx/dgicurg/cclimatico/download/cancun_analisis_costos.pdf}}</ref>

Moisture from the remnants of Ismael extended into southwestern [[Arizona]] and southern [[New Mexico]]. The storm dropped heavy precipitation near the New Mexico/[[Texas]] border, including a peak total of {{convert|8.53|in|mm}} in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]].<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|date=2006-08-02|title=Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Ismael|publisher=[[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center]]|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/ismael1995.html}}</ref> In addition, there were unofficial estimates of over {{convert|10|in|mm}}. The rainfall led to flooding of roads and buildings. Multiple highways and railroads were closed due to [[washout]]s.

==Aftermath==
Following the passage of the hurricane, reinforcement workers quickly repaired the communication network, and other workers distributed aid to victims in [[Sonora]]. The Mexican government allocated about ${{Formatprice|4500000}} (1995&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|34000000}} 1995 [[MXN]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|4500000|1995|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure.<ref name="ismaelsp"/> Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All sunken ships and drowned bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.<ref name="cndh"/>

Due to the damage and deaths, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ismael with '''Israel''', another Spanish name beginning with the letter "I" set to be used in the [[2001 Pacific hurricane season]]. During the 2001 season, a reporter stationed in [[Israel]] felt offended from the name choice, and the president of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] felt it was insensitive. Hundreds of people sent e-mails or called the [[National Hurricane Center]], and as a result [[Max Mayfield]] called the members of the World Meteorological Organization.<ref name="wpo">{{cite web|author=Hanna Rosin|date=2004-08-02|title=Hurricane Names|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2010-04-13|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50952-2004Aug8_2.html}}</ref> The name Israel was replaced with '''Ivo''' during the season. Ivo wasn't retired after the 2001 or 2007 seasons, and it will next be used in the 2013 season.<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=Koji Kuroiwa|publisher=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|date=2009-09-01|title=Regional Association IV (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) Hurricane Operational Plan 2009 Edition|accessdate=2010-04-13|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP30_2009_OpsPlan_English.pdf}}</ref>
