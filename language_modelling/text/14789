'''Beaufort Island''' {{coord|76|56|S|166|56|E|display=title}} is an [[island]] in [[Antarctica]]'s [[Ross Sea]]. It is the northernmost feature of the [[Ross Archipelago]],<ref name=Ohio>[http://www.geology.ohio-state.edu/TAMDEF/Sites/Beaufort_Island/Beaufort_Island_Info.htm Beaufort Island TAMDEF Page], Ohio State University.</ref> lying {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=none}} north of [[Cape Bird]], [[Ross Island]]. It is approximately {{convert|18.4|km<U+00B2>|sqmi|0|abbr=in}} in area. It was first charted by [[James Clark Ross]] in 1841. Ross named the island for [[Francis Beaufort|Sir Francis Beaufort]], [[hydrography|hydrographer]] to the British [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=Stonehouse/>

== Geography ==
Beaufort Island was created by volcanic activity and is made up of [[basalt]]. It is semi circular in shape. The highest point in the island is Paton Peak, at {{convert|771|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The island has varied [[terrain]] and [[habitat]]s. Much of the western side of the island is covered by moderately sloping ice fields with ice cliffs about {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high on the coast. The east and south sides of the island are mostly free of ice, with steep inaccessible cliffs that rise straight from the sea. Here the ice-free ground has a gentle slope and has ponds in summer and small meltwater streams that drain to the coast.<ref name=Stonehouse>Stonehouse, Bernard, 2002, ''Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans'', John Wiley and Sons, p. 25, ISBN 0-471-98665-8.</ref><ref name=nsf>[http://www.nsf.gov/od/opp/antarct/aca/nsf01151/aca2_spa105.pdf Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 105 Beaufort Island, McMurdo Sound, Ross Sea], National Science Foundation.</ref>

== Ecology ==
Beaufort Island is designated an [[Antarctic Specially Protected Area]] in order to preserve its natural ecological system and to protect its varied and numerous bird species.<ref name=Stonehouse/><ref>[http://www.aad.gov.au/apa/aspa/sites/aspa105/index.html Beaufort Island, Ross Sea], Antarctic Protected Areas.</ref> The island is isolated and difficult to access and is visited infrequently by people. It is largely undisturbed by direct human activity, and there have been fewer opportunities for the introduction of [[introduced species|exotic species]] than other locations in the Ross Sea.<ref name=nsf/> Although some studies have been conducted on the island, it has not been comprehensively studied.<ref>[http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/downloads/environment/ASPA105mgmtplan.pdf Management Plan for Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) No. 105], Antarctica New Zealand.</ref>

There is a small colony of breeding [[Emperor Penguin]]s on nearshore sea ice at the north end of the island. There is a large [[Ad<U+00E9>lie Penguin]] colony on a [[raised beach]] called Cadwalader Beach at the south-western end of the island. The island also has several breeding colonies of [[South Polar Skua]].<ref name=Stonehouse/><ref name=nsf/>

The island has an extensive area of vegetation on a [[moraine]] bench {{convert|5|-|7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} above the beach at the north end of the island. The moraine bench is up to {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide. The vegetation is dominated by the [[moss]] species ''Bryum argenteum''. It is the most extensive and continuous area of mosses known of in the [[McMurdo Sound]] region. There is also a diverse community of [[algae]]. This location is one of the most southerly locations where red [[snow algae]] (''Chlamydomonas'' sp., ''Chloromonas'' sp., and ''Chlamydomonas nivalis'') are found. This location is favourable for vegetation growth because of warm summer temperatures. Its northerly aspect and the shelter provided by high ice cliffs protect against southerly winds. Water is supplied from the ice-cliffs and snow banks.<ref name=nsf/>
