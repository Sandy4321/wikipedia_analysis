A '''credit default swap''' (CDS) is a [[swap (finance)|swap]] contract in which the protection buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (often referred to as the CDS "fee" or "spread") to the protection seller and, in exchange, receives a payoff if a credit instrument (typically a [[bond (finance)|bond]] or loan) experiences a [[credit event]].

In its simplest form, a credit default swap is a bilateral contract between the buyer and seller of protection.  The CDS will refer to a <U+201C>reference entity" or "reference obligor", usually a corporation or government. The reference entity is not a party to the contract.  The protection buyer makes quarterly premium payments<U+2014>the <U+201C>spread<U+201D><U+2014>to the protection seller. If the reference entity defaults, the protection seller pays the buyer the [[par value]] of the bond in exchange for physical delivery of the bond, although settlement may also be by cash or auction.<ref name="International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.

A holder of a bond may <U+201C>buy protection<U+201D> to hedge its risk of default.  In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS are not similar to or subject to regulations governing casualty or life insurance.   Also, investors can buy and sell  protection without owning any debt of the reference entity.  These <U+201C>naked credit default swaps<U+201D> allow traders to speculate on debt issues and the creditworthiness of reference entities.   Credit default swaps can be used to create synthetic long and short positions in the reference entity.<ref name='Sirri Testimony'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts101508ers.htm |title=Testimony Concerning Credit Default Swaps Before the House Committee on Agriculture October 15, 2008 |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |last=Sirri |first=Erik, Director, Division of Trading and Markets U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission }}</ref>  Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS.<ref name="kopecki1">{{cite news | first=Dawn | last=Kopecki | coauthors= Shannon D.

A "credit default swap" (CDS) is a [[credit derivative]] contract between two [[counterparty|counterparties]].  The buyer makes periodic payments to the seller, and in return receives a payoff if an underlying financial instrument [[default (finance)|defaults]] or experiences a similar [[credit event]].<ref name="International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ISDA"/><ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref>CFA Institute. (2008). ''Derivatives and Alternative Investments.'' pg G-11. Boston: Pearson Custom Publishing. ISBN 0-536-34228-8.</ref> The CDS may refer to a specified loan or bond obligation of a <U+201C>reference entity<U+201D>, usually a corporation or government.<ref name="FRB Primer"/>

As an example, imagine that an investor buys a CDS from AAA-Bank, where the reference entity is Risky Corp.  The investor<U+2014>the buyer of protection<U+2014>will make regular payments to AAA-Bank<U+2014>the seller of protection. ''If'' Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the investor will receive a one-time payment from AAA-Bank, and the CDS contract is terminated. A default is  referred to as a "[[credit event]]" and include such events as failure to pay, restructuring and bankruptcy.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref name='IMF254'/> CDS contracts on sovereign obligations also usually include as credit events repudiation, moratorium and acceleration.<ref name='IMF254'/>

If the investor actually owns Risky Corp debt, the CDS can be thought of as hedging.  But investors can also buy CDS contracts referencing Risky Corp debt without actually owning any Risky Corp debt.  This may be done for speculative purposes, to bet against the solvency of Risky Corp in a gamble to make money if it fails, or to hedge investments in other companies whose fortunes are expected to be similar to those of Risky (see [[#Uses|Uses]]).

If the reference entity (Risky Corp) defaults, one of two kinds of [[#Settlement|settlement]] can occur:
*the investor delivers a defaulted asset to AAA-Bank for payment of the [[par value]], which is known as ''physical settlement'';
*AAA-Bank pays the investor the difference between the par value and the market price of a specified debt obligation (even if Risky Corp defaults there is usually some ''recovery'', i.e. not all your money will be lost), which is known as ''cash settlement''.

The "spread" of a CDS is the annual amount the protection buyer must pay the protection seller over the length of the contract, expressed as a percentage of the [[notional amount]]. For example, if the CDS spread of Risky Corp is 50 [[basis point]]s, or 0.5% (1 basis point = 0.01%), then an investor buying $10&nbsp;million worth of protection from AAA-Bank must pay the bank $50,000 per year.  These payments continue until either the CDS contract expires or Risky Corp defaults.  Payments are usually made on a quarterly basis, in arrears.

Credit default swaps are not retail transactions.  Most CDS<U+2019>s are in the $10<U+2013>20&nbsp;million range with maturities between one and 10 years.<ref name="FRB Primer"/>  Five years is the most typical maturity.<ref name='Mengle Overview' />

All things being equal, at any given time, if the maturity of two credit default swaps is the same, then the CDS associated with a company with a ''higher'' CDS spread is considered ''more likely'' to default by the market, since a higher fee is being charged to protect against this happening.  However, factors such as liquidity and estimated loss given default can affect the comparison.  Credit spread rates and credit ratings of the underlying or reference obligations are considered among money managers to be the best indicators of the likelihood of sellers of CDSs having to perform under these contracts.<ref name='Deutsche Bank Report' />

===Not insurance===
CDS contracts have been compared with insurance, because the buyer pays a premium and, in return, receives a sum of money if one of the events specified in the contract occurs. However, there are a number of differences between CDS and insurance, for example:
* The buyer of a CDS does not need to own the underlying [[Security (finance)|security]] or other form of [[credit risk|credit exposure]]; in fact the buyer does not even have to suffer a loss from the default event.<ref>[http://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts092308cc.htm] Cox, Christopher, Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, if certain requirements are met, credit derivatives will not qualify as an agreement of (non-life) insurance because such an arrangement would in those circumstances not contain all the elements necessary to qualify it as such. |date=August 10, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}</ref>  In contrast, to purchase insurance, the insured is generally expected to have an [[insurable interest]] such as owning a debt obligation;
* the seller doesn't have to be a regulated entity;
* the seller is not required to maintain any reserves to pay off buyers, although major CDS dealers are subject to bank capital requirements;
* insurers manage risk primarily by setting [[Loss reserving|loss reserves]] based on the [[Law of large numbers]], while dealers in CDS manage risk primarily by means of offsetting CDS (hedging) with other dealers and transactions in underlying bond markets;
* in the United States CDS contracts are generally subject to [[mark-to-market]] accounting, introducing [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that would not be present in an insurance contract;
* [[Hedge accounting]] may not be available under US [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] (GAAP) unless the requirements of [http://www.fasb.org/st/summary/stsum133.shtml FAS 133] are met. In practice this rarely happens.

However the most important difference between CDS and insurance is simply that an insurance contract provides an indemnity against the losses ''actually suffered'' by the policy holder, whereas the CDS provides an equal payout to all holders, calculated using an agreed, market-wide method.

There are also important differences in the approaches used to pricing. The cost of insurance is based on [[Actuarial science|actuarial analysis]]. CDSs are derivatives whose cost is determined using financial models and by arbitrage relationships with other credit market instruments such as loans and bonds from the same 'Reference Entity' to which the CDS contract refers.

Further, to cancel the insurance contract the buyer can simply stop paying premium whereas in case of CDS the protection buyer may need to unwind the contract which might result in a profit or loss situation

Insurance contracts require the disclosure of all known risks involved. CDSs have no such requirement. Most significantly, unlike insurance companies, sellers of CDSs are not required to maintain any capital reserves to guarantee payment of claims.

===Risk===
When entering into a CDS, both the buyer and seller of credit protection take on [[counterparty risk]]:<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref name="Mengle Overview"/>
* The buyer takes the risk that the seller will default.  If AAA-Bank and Risky Corp. default simultaneously ("double default"), the buyer loses its protection against default by the reference entity.  If AAA-Bank defaults but Risky Corp. does not, the buyer might need to replace the defaulted CDS at a higher cost.
* The seller takes the risk that the buyer will default on the contract, depriving the seller of the expected revenue stream. More important, a seller normally limits its risk by buying offsetting protection from another party&nbsp;<U+2014> that is, it hedges its exposure. If the original buyer drops out, the seller squares its position by either unwinding the hedge transaction or by selling a new CDS to a third party. Depending on market conditions, that may be at a lower price than the original CDS and may therefore involve a loss to the seller.

In the future, in the event that regulatory reforms require that CDS be traded and settled via a central exchange/[[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]], such as ICE TCC, there will no longer be 'counterparty risk', as the risk of the counterparty will be held with the central exchange/clearing house.

As is true with other forms of over-the-counter derivative, CDS might involve [[liquidity risk]].  If one or both parties to a CDS contract must post collateral (which is common), there can be margin calls requiring the posting of additional [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. The required collateral is agreed on by the parties when the CDS is first issued. This [[margin (finance)|margin]] amount may vary over the life of the CDS contract, if the market price of the CDS contract changes, or the [[credit rating]] of one of the parties changes.

Another kind of risk for the seller of credit default swaps is jump risk or jump-to-default risk.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/> A seller of a CDS could be collecting monthly premiums with little expectation that the reference entity may default.  A default creates a sudden obligation on the protection sellers to pay millions, if not billions, of dollars to protection buyers.<ref name='Gensler'>{{cite web|url=http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/speechandtestimony/opagensler-32.pdf |title=Keynote Address of Chairman Gary Gensler, OTC Derivatives Reform, Markit<U+2019>s Outlook for OTC Derivatives Markets Conference|date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |last=Gensler |first=Gary, Chairman Commodity Futures Trading Commission|format=PDF }}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> This risk is not present in other over-the-counter derivatives.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref name="Gensler"/>

==Uses==
Credit default swaps can be used by investors for [[speculation]], [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] and [[arbitrage]].

===Speculation===
Credit default swaps allow investors to speculate on changes in CDS spreads of single names or of market indices such as the North American CDX index or the European iTraxx index.  An investor might believe that an entity's CDS spreads are too high or too low, relative to the entity's bond yields, and attempt to profit from that view by entering into a trade, known as a [[Basis trading|basis trade]], that combines a CDS with a cash bond and an interest-rate swap.

Finally, an investor might speculate on an entity's credit quality, since generally CDS spreads will increase as credit-worthiness declines, and decline as credit-worthiness increases.  The investor might therefore buy CDS protection on a company to speculate that it is about to default.  Alternatively, the investor might sell protection if it thinks that the company's creditworthiness might improve.  The investor selling the CDS is viewed as being <U+201C>[[long (finance)|long]]<U+201D> on the CDS and the credit, as if the investor owned the bond.<ref name='Sirri Testimony' /><ref name="Mengle Overview"/> In contrast, the investor who bought protection is <U+201C>[[short (finance)|short]]<U+201D> on the  CDS and the underlying credit.<ref name="Sirri Testimony"/><ref name="Mengle Overview"/>  Credit default swaps opened up important new avenues to speculators.  Investors could go long on a bond without any upfront cost of buying a bond; all the investor need do was promise to pay in the event of default.<ref name='CDO-Lucas'>{{cite book | last = Lucas | first = Douglas | authorlink = | coauthors = Laurie S.

For example, a hedge fund believes that Risky Corp will soon default on its debt.  Therefore, it buys $10&nbsp;million worth of CDS protection for two years from AAA-Bank, with Risky Corp as the reference entity, at a spread of 500 basis points (=5%) per annum.
*If Risky Corp does indeed default after, say, one year, then the hedge fund will have paid $500,000 to AAA-Bank, but will then receive $10&nbsp;million (assuming zero recovery rate, and that AAA-Bank has the liquidity to cover the loss), thereby making a profit. AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5&nbsp;million loss minus recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.

*However, if Risky Corp does not default, then the CDS contract will run for two years, and the hedge fund will have ended up paying $1&nbsp;million, without any return, thereby making a loss.  AAA-Bank, by selling protection, has made $1&nbsp;million without any upfront investment.

Note that there is a third possibility in the above scenario; the hedge fund could decide to liquidate its position after a certain period of time in an attempt to realise its gains or losses.  For example:
* After 1 year, the market now considers Risky Corp ''more likely'' to default, so its CDS spread has ''widened'' from 500 to 1500 basis points.  The hedge fund may choose to ''sell'' $10&nbsp;million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this higher rate.  Therefore over the two years the hedge fund will pay the bank 2 * 5% * $10&nbsp;million = $1&nbsp;million, but will receive 1 * 15% * $10&nbsp;million = $1.5&nbsp;million, giving a total profit of $500,000.
* In another scenario, after one year the market now considers Risky much ''less likely'' to default, so its CDS spread has ''tightened'' from 500 to 250 basis points.  Again, the hedge fund may choose to ''sell'' $10&nbsp;million worth of protection for 1 year to AAA-Bank at this lower spread.  Therefore over the two years the hedge fund will pay the bank 2 * 5% * $10&nbsp;million = $1&nbsp;million, but will receive 1 * 2.5% * $10&nbsp;million = $250,000, giving a total loss of $750,000. This loss is smaller than the $1&nbsp;million loss that would have occurred if the second transaction had not been entered into.

Transactions such as these do not even have to be entered into over the long-term.  If Risky Corp's CDS spread had widened by just a couple of basis points over the course of one day, the hedge fund could have entered into an offsetting contract immediately and made a small profit over the life of the two CDS contracts.

Credit default swaps are also used to structure synthetic [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs).   Instead of owning bonds or loans, a synthetic CDO gets credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets through the use of CDS.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite journal|title=The Promise And Perils of Credit Derivatives|journal=University of Cincinnati Law Review|year=2007|first=Frank|last=Partnoy|coauthors=David A.

An example of a synthetic CDO is Abacus 2007-AC1 which is the subject of the civil suit for fraud brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April 2010.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=SEC charges Goldman Sachs with fraud in subprime case | date=April 16, 2010 | publisher= | url =http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/regulation/2010-04-16-goldman-sec-charges_N.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = April 27, 2010 | language = }}</ref>  Abacus is a synthetic CDO consisting of credit default swaps referencing a variety of mortgage backed securities.

'''Naked credit default swaps.''' In the examples above, the hedge fund did not own debt of Risky Corp. A CDS in which the buyer does not own the underlying debt is referred to as a ''naked credit default swap'', estimated to be up to 80% of the credit default swap market.<ref name="kopecki1"/><ref name='Salon' /> There is currently a debate in the United States and Europe about whether speculative uses of credit default swaps should be banned.  Legislation is under consideration by Congress as part of financial reform.<ref name='Salon' />

Critics assert that naked CDS should be banned, comparing them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor<U+2019>s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing to the concept of [[insurable interest]], critics say you should not be able to buy a CDS<U+2014>insurance against default<U+2014>when you do not own the bond.<ref name='Brookings Paper'>{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2010/0407_derivatives_litan/0407_derivatives_litan.pdf |title=The Derivatives Dealers<U+2019> Club and Derivatives Markets Reform: A Guide for Policy Makers, Citizens and Other Interested Parties |accessdate=April 15, 2010 |last=Litan |first=Robert E. |date=April 7, 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=Brookings Institution }}</ref><ref name='Buiter'>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/03/should-you-be-able-to-sell-what-you-do-not-own/ |title=Should you be able to sell what you do not own? |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |last=Buiter |first=Willem |date=March 16, 2009 |work=Financial Times  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7b56f5b2-24a3-11df-8be0-00144feab49a.html |title=Time to outlaw naked credit default swaps |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |last=Munchau |first=Wolfgang }}</ref> Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.<ref name='Salon' /><ref name="Leopold2009">{{cite book|author=Les Leopold|title=The Looting of America: How Wall Street's Game of Fantasy Finance Destroyed Our Jobs, Our Pensions, and Prosperity, and What We Can Do About It|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oS7I_Pq00IQC&pg=PA221|accessdate=April 24, 2010|date=June 2, 2009|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=9781603582056}}</ref>

===Hedging===

Credit default swaps are often used to manage the risk of default which arises from holding debt.  A bank, for example, may hedge its risk that a borrower may default on a loan by entering into a CDS contract as the buyer of protection. If the loan goes into default, the proceeds from the CDS contract will cancel out the losses on the underlying debt.<ref name="FRB Primer"/>

There are other ways to eliminate or reduce the risk of default. The bank could sell (that is, assign) the loan outright or bring in other banks as [[participation loan|participants]]. However, these options may not meet the bank<U+2019>s needs. Consent of the corporate borrower is often required. The bank may not want to incur the time and cost to find loan participants.  If both the borrower and lender are well-known and the market (or even worse, the news media) learns that the bank is selling the loan, then the sale may be viewed as signaling a lack of trust in the borrower, which could severely damage the banker-client relationship.  In addition, the bank simply may not want to sell or share the potential profits from the loan. By buying a credit default swap, the bank can lay off default risk while still keeping the loan in its portfolio.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The downside to this hedge is that without default risk, a bank may have no motivation to actively monitor the loan and the counterparty has no relationship to the borrower.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Another kind of hedge is against concentration risk.  A bank<U+2019>s risk management team may advise that the bank is overly concentrated with a particular borrower or industry.  The bank can lay off some of this risk by buying a CDS. Because the borrower<U+2014>the reference entity<U+2014>is not a party to a credit default swap, entering into a CDS allows the bank to achieve its diversity objectives without impacting its loan portfolio or customer relations.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/>  Similarly,  a bank selling a CDS can diversify its portfolio by gaining exposure to an industry in which the selling bank has no customer base.<ref name="FRB Primer"/><ref name="Mengle Overview"/><ref name='OCC Bulletin 96-43'>{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/bulletin/96-43.txt |title=OCC 96-43; OCC Bulletin; Subject: Credit Derivatives; Description: Guidelines for National Banks |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |date=August 12, 1996 |format=txt |publisher=Office of the Comptroller of the Currency }}</ref>

A bank buying protection can also use a CDS to free regulatory capital.  By offloading a particular credit risk, a bank is not required to hold as much capital in reserve against the risk of default (traditionally 8% of the total loan under [[Basel I]]).  This frees resources which the bank can use to make other loans to the same key customer or to other borrowers.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref name='Arriva'>{{cite web|url=http://www.derivativesstrategy.com/magazine/archive/1997/1296fea1.asp |title=The Long Awaited Arrival of Credit Derivatives |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |last=McDermott |first=Robert |date=December/January 1997 |work=Derivatives Strategy }}</ref>

Hedging risk is not limited to banks as lenders. Holders of corporate bonds, such as banks, pension funds or insurance companies, may buy a CDS as a hedge for similar reasons.
Pension fund example:  A pension fund owns five-year bonds issued by Risky Corp with par value of $10&nbsp;million. In order to manage the risk of losing money if Risky Corp defaults on its debt, the pension fund buys a CDS from Derivative Bank in a [[notional amount]] of $10&nbsp;million.  The CDS trades at 200 [[basis point]]s (200 basis points = 2.00 percent).  In return for this credit protection, the pension fund pays 2% of $10&nbsp;million ($200,000) per annum in quarterly installments of $50,000 to Derivative Bank.
*If Risky Corporation does not default on its bond payments, the pension fund makes quarterly payments to Derivative Bank for 5 years and receives its $10&nbsp;million back after five years from Risky Corp. Though the protection payments totaling $1&nbsp;million reduce investment returns for the pension fund, its risk of loss due to Risky Corp defaulting on the bond is eliminated.
*If Risky Corporation defaults on its debt three years into the CDS contract, the pension fund would stop paying the quarterly premium, and Derivative Bank would ensure that the pension fund is refunded for its loss of $10&nbsp;million minus recovery (either by physical or cash settlement&nbsp;<U+2014> see Settlement [[#Settlement|below]]).  The pension fund still loses the $600,000 it has paid over three years, but without the CDS contract it would have lost the entire $10&nbsp;million minus recovery.

In addition to financial institutions, large suppliers can use a credit default swap on a public bond issue or a basket of similar risks as a proxy for its own credit risk exposure on receivables.<ref name='Salon' /><ref name='Brookings Paper' /><ref name='Arriva' /><ref>{{cite journal|title=Using Letters Of Credit, Credit Default Swaps And Other Forms of Credit Enhancements in Net Lease Transactions|journal=Virginia Law & Business Review|date=Spring 2009|first=Ken|last=Miller|coauthors=|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69<U+2013>78, 80|id= |url=http://www.virginialawbusrev.org/VLBR4-1pdfs/Miller.pdf|format=|accessdate=April 15, 2010|quote=  the use of an exotic credit default swap (called a Net Lease CDS) which will effectively hedge tenant credit risk but at a substantially higher price than that of a vanilla swap.}}</ref>

Although credit default swaps have been highly criticized for their role in the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|financial crisis]], most observers conclude that using credit default swaps  as a hedging device has a useful purpose.<ref name='Brookings Paper' />

===Arbitrage===
''Capital Structure Arbitrage'' is an example of an [[arbitrage]] strategy that utilizes CDS transactions.<ref>[http://cisdm.som.umass.edu/research/pdffiles/Capital%20Structure%20Manolis%20Chatiras.pdf] Chatiras, Manolis, and Barsendu Mukherjee. ''Capital Structure Arbitrage: Investigation using Stocks and High Yield Bonds''. Amherst, MA: Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets, Isenberg School of Management, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 2004. Retrieved March 17, 2009.</ref>  This technique relies on the fact that a company's stock price and its CDS spread should exhibit negative correlation; i.e. if the outlook for a company improves then its share price should go up and its CDS spread should tighten, since it is less likely to default on its debt.  However if its outlook worsens then its CDS spread should widen and its stock price should fall.  Techniques reliant on this are known as [[capital structure]] arbitrage because they exploit market inefficiencies between different parts of the same company's capital structure; i.e. mis-pricings between a company's debt and equity.  An arbitrageur will attempt to exploit the ''spread'' between a company's CDS and its equity in certain situations.  For example, if a company has announced some bad news and its share price has dropped by 25%, but its CDS spread has remained unchanged, then an investor might expect the CDS spread to increase relative to the share price.  Therefore a basic strategy would be to go long on the CDS spread (by buying CDS protection) while simultaneously hedging oneself by buying the underlying stock.  This technique would benefit in the event of the CDS spread widening relative to the equity price, but would lose money if the company's CDS spread tightened relative to its equity.

An interesting situation in which the inverse correlation between a company's stock price and CDS spread breaks down is during a [[Leveraged buyout]] (LBO).  Frequently this will lead to the company's CDS spread widening due to the extra debt that will soon be put on the company's books, but also an ''increase''  in its share price, since buyers of a company usually end up paying a premium.

Another common arbitrage strategy aims to exploit the fact that the swap-adjusted spread of a CDS should trade closely with that of the underlying cash bond issued by the reference entity.  Misalignments in spreads may occur due to technical reasons such as:
*Specific settlement differences
*Shortages in a particular underlying instrument
*Existence of buyers constrained from buying exotic derivatives.
The difference between CDS spreads and asset swap spreads is called the ''basis'' and should theoretically be close to zero.  Basis trades can aim to exploit any differences to make risk-free profit.

BISTRO was the first example of what later became known as synthetic [[collateralized debt obligations]] (CDOs).

Mindful of the concentration of default risk as one of the causes of the [[Savings and loan crisis|S&L crisis]] , regulators initially found CDS's ability to disperse default risk attractive. <ref name = "FoolsGold"/> 
In 2000, credit default swaps became largely exempt from regulation by both the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and  the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CTFC).  The [[Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000]], which was also responsible for the [[Enron loophole]] , <ref name='IMF254' /> specifically stated that CDSs are neither futures nor securities and so are outside the remit of the SEC and CTFC. <ref name = "FoolsGold"/>

===Market growth===
At first, banks were the dominant players in the market, as CDS were primarily used to hedge risk in connection with its lending activities.  Banks also saw an opportunity to free up regulatory capital. By march 1998, the global market for CDS was estimated atabout $300 billion, with JP Morgan alone accounting for about $50billion of this. <ref name = "FoolsGold"/>  The high market share enjoyed by the banks was soon eroded as more and more asset managers and hedge funds saw trading opportunities in credit default swaps.  By 2002, investors as speculators, rather than banks as hedgers, dominated the market.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/><ref name="Mengle Overview"/><ref name="Arriva"/><ref name=smithson/>
National banks in the USA used credit default swaps as early as 1996.<ref name='OCC Bulletin 96-43' />  In that year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency measured the size of the market as tens of billions of dollars.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ellen | last=Simon | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Meltdown 101: What are credit default swaps? | date=October 20, 2008 | publisher= | url =http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-10-20-2778456512_x.htm | work =USA Today | pages = | accessdate = April 7, 2010 | language = }}</ref>  Six years later, by year-end 2002, the outstanding amount was over $2&nbsp;trillion.<ref name='ISDA Annual Chart' />  Although speculators fueled the exponential growth, other factors also played a part.

===Market as of 2008===

[[File:Credit default swaps vs total nominals plus debt.png|thumb|Proportion of CDSs nominals (lower left) held by United States banks compared to all derivatives, in 2008Q2. The black disc represents the 2008 public debt.]]

Since default is a relatively rare occurrence (historically around 0.2% of investment grade companies will default in any one year),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efalken.com/banking/html's/defaultcurves.htm |title=Default Rates |publisher=Efalken.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> in most CDS contracts the only payments are the premium payments from buyer to seller.  Thus, although the above figures for outstanding notionals are very large, in the absence of default the net cashflows will only be a small fraction of this total: for a 100 bp = 1% spread, the annual cash flows are only 1% of the notional amount.

====Regulatory concerns over CDS====
The market for Credit Default Swaps attracted considerable concern from regulators after a number of large scale incidents in 2008, starting with the collapse of [[Bear Stearns]].<ref name="Colin Barr">{{cite news
|url= http://money.cnn.com/2009/03/16/markets/cds.bear.fortune/index.htm
|title= The truth about credit default swaps
|publisher= CNN / Fortune
|author= Colin Barr
|accessdate=March 27, 2009
| date=March 16, 2009}}</ref>

In the days and weeks leading up to Bear's collapse, the bank's CDS spread widened dramatically, indicating a surge of buyers taking out protection on the bank.  It has been suggested  that this widening was responsible for the perception that Bear Stearns was vulnerable, and therefore restricted its access to wholesale capital which eventually led to its forced sale to [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan]] in March.  An alternative, unsupported view is that this surge in CDS protection buyers was a ''symptom'' rather than a ''cause'' of Bear's collapse; i.e., investors saw that Bear was in trouble, and sought to hedge any naked exposure to the bank, or speculate on its collapse.

In September, the bankruptcy of [[Lehman Brothers]]  caused a total close to $400&nbsp;billion to become payable to the buyers of CDS protection referenced against the insolvent bank.  However the net amount that changed hands was around $7.2&nbsp;billion<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/25137702-972d-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |title=/ UK&nbsp;<U+2014> Bad news on Lehman CDS |publisher=Ft.com |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  This difference is due to the process of 'netting'.  Market participants co-operated so that CDS sellers were allowed to deduct from their payouts the inbound funds due to them from their hedging positions.   Dealers  generally attempt to remain risk-neutral so their losses and gains after big events will on the whole offset each other.

Also in September American International Group  ([[AIG]]) required a federal bailout because it had been excessively selling CDS protection without hedging against the possibility that the reference entities might decline in value, which exposed the insurance giant to potential losses over $100&nbsp;billion. The CDS on Lehman were settled smoothly, as was largely the case for the other 11 credit events occurring in 2008 which triggered payouts.<ref name="Colin Barr"/>  And while it is arguable that other incidents would have been as bad or worse if less efficient instruments than CDS had been used for speculation and insurance purposes, the closing months of 2008 saw regulators working hard to reduce the risk involved in CDS transactions.

In 2008 there was no centralized [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] or [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] for CDS transactions; they were all done [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]] (OTC).  This led to recent calls for the market to open up in terms of transparency and regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts092308cc.htm |title=Testimony Concerning Turmoil in U.S. Credit Markets: Recent Actions Regarding Government Sponsored Entities, Investment Banks and Other Financial Institutions (Christopher Cox, September 23, 2008) |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  In November, DTCC, which runs a warehouse for CDS trade confirmations accounting for around 90% of the total market,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/05/creditcrunch-marketturmoil | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Banks hit back at derivatives criticism | first=Simon | last=Bowers | date=November 5, 2008 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> announced that it will release market data on the outstanding notional of CDS trades on a weekly basis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harrington |first=Shannon D. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=aZYSaaTg9xJg&refer=europe |title=Credit-Default Swaps on Italy, Spain Are Most Traded (Update1) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  The data can be accessed on the DTCC's website here:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtcc.com/products/derivserv/data/index.php?lpos=home_splash_promo&lid=index.php |title=DTCC <U+203A> DTCC Deriv/SERV Trade Information Warehouse Reports |publisher=Dtcc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted an exemption for [[IntercontinentalExchange]] to begin guaranteeing credit-default swaps.

The SEC exemption represented the last regulatory approval needed by Atlanta-based Intercontinental. Its larger competitor, CME Group Inc., hasn<U+2019>t received an SEC exemption, and agency spokesman John Nester said he didn<U+2019>t know when a decision would be made.

===Market as of 2009===
The early months of 2009 saw several fundamental changes to the way CDSs operate, resulting from concerns over the instruments' safety after the events of the previous year. According to [[Deutsche Bank]] managing director Athanassios Diplas "the industry pushed through 10 years worth of changes in just a few months"
By late 2008 processes had been introduced allowing CDSs which offset each other to be  cancelled. Along with termination of contracts that have recently paid out such as those based on Lehmans, this had by March reduced the face value of the market down to an estimated $30&nbsp;trillion.<ref name="Aline Van Duyn">{{cite web

</ref> U.S. and European regulators are developing separate plans  to stabilize the derivatives market. Additionally there are some globally agreed standards falling into place in March 2009, administered by International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). Two of the key changes are:

1. The introduction of central clearing houses, one for the US and one for Europe.  A clearing house acts as the central counterparty to both sides of a CDS transaction, thereby reducing the counterparty risk that both buyer and seller face.

2. The international standardization of CDS contracts,  to prevent legal disputes in ambiguous cases where what the payout should be is unclear.

Speaking before the changes went live ,  Sivan Mahadevan, a derivatives strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York, stated {{cquote|A clearinghouse, and changes to the contracts to standardize them, will probably boost activity. ... Trading will be much easier.... We'll see new players come to the market because they<U+2019>ll like the idea of this being a better and more traded product. We also feel like over time we'll see the creation of different types of products.}}

In the U.S., central clearing operations began in March 2009 , operated by InterContinental Exchange (ICE). A key competitor also interested in entering the CDS clearing sector is CME Group.

In Europe, CDS Index clearing was launched by ICE's European subsidiary ICE Clear Europe on July 31. It launched Single Name clearing in Dec 2009. By the end of 2009, it had cleared CDS contracts worth EUR 885&nbsp;billion reducing the open interest down to EUR 75&nbsp;billion <ref>[https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/ReportCenter.shtml?reportId=98 ICE - Report Center - Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

By the end of 2009, banks had reclaimned much of their market share; hedge funds had largely retreated from the market after the crises. According to an estimate by the [[Banque de France]], by late 2009 the bank JP Morgan alone now had about 30% of the global CDS  market. <ref name = "FoolsGold"/>

====Government approvals relating to Intercontinental and its competitor CME====
The SEC's approval for ICE's request to be exempted from rules that would prevent it clearing CDSs was the third government action granted to Intercontinental in one week. On March 3, its proposed acquisition of Clearing Corp., a Chicago clearinghouse owned by eight of the largest dealers in the credit-default swap market, was approved by the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. On March 5, the Federal Reserve Board, which  oversees the clearinghouse, granted a request for ICE to begin clearing.

Clearing Corp. shareholders including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG, received $39&nbsp;million in cash from Intercontinental in the acquisition, as well as the Clearing Corp.<U+2019>s cash on hand and a 50-50 profit-sharing agreement with Intercontinental on the revenue generated from processing the swaps.

SEC spokesperson John Nestor stated {{cquote| For several months the SEC and our fellow regulators have worked closely with all of the firms wishing to establish central counterparties.... We believe that CME should be in a position soon to provide us with the information necessary to allow the commission to take action on its exemptive requests.}}

Other proposals to clear credit-default swaps have been made by NYSE Euronext, Eurex AG and LCH.Clearnet Ltd. Only the NYSE effort is available now for clearing after starting on Dec. 22. As of Jan. 30, no swaps had been cleared by the NYSE<U+2019>s London- based derivatives exchange, according to NYSE Chief Executive Officer Duncan Niederauer.<ref>{{cite web

====Clearing house member requirements====
Members of the Intercontinental clearinghouse will have to have a net worth of at least $5&nbsp;billion and a credit rating of A or better to clear their credit-default swap trades. Intercontinental said in the statement today that all market participants such as hedge funds, banks or other institutions are open to become members of the clearinghouse as long as they meet these requirements.

A clearinghouse acts as the buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, reducing the risk of a counterparty defaulting on a transaction. In the over-the-counter market, where credit- default swaps are currently traded, participants are exposed to each other in case of a default. A clearinghouse also provides one location for regulators to view traders<U+2019> positions and prices.

==Terms of a typical CDS contract==
A CDS contract is typically documented under a ''confirmation'' referencing the credit derivatives definitions as published by the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isda.org/publications/isdacredit-deri-def-sup-comm.aspx |title=2003 Credit Derivatives Definitions |publisher=Isda.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> The confirmation typically specifies a ''reference entity'', a corporation or sovereign that generally, although not always, has debt outstanding, and a ''reference obligation'', usually an unsubordinated [[corporate bond]] or [[government bond]]. The period over which default protection extends is defined by the contract ''effective date'' and ''scheduled termination date''.

The confirmation also specifies a ''calculation agent'' who is responsible for making determinations as to ''successors'' and ''substitute reference obligations'' (for example necessary if the original reference obligation was a loan that is repaid before the expiry  of the contract), and for performing various calculation and administrative functions in connection with the transaction.  By market convention, in contracts between CDS dealers and end-users, the dealer is generally the calculation agent, and in contracts between CDS dealers, the protection seller is generally the calculation agent.  It is not the responsibility of the calculation agent to determine whether or not a credit event has occurred but rather a matter of fact that, pursuant to the terms of typical contracts, must be supported by ''publicly available information'' delivered along with a ''credit event notice''.  Typical CDS contracts do not provide an internal mechanism for challenging the occurrence or non-occurrence of a credit event and rather leave the matter to the courts if necessary, though actual instances of specific events being disputed are relatively rare.

CDS confirmations also specify the ''credit events'' that will give rise to payment obligations by the protection seller and delivery obligations by the protection buyer.  Typical credit events include ''bankruptcy'' with respect to the reference entity and ''failure to pay'' with respect to its direct or guaranteed bond or loan debt.  CDS written on North American [[investment grade]] corporate reference entities, European corporate reference entities and sovereigns generally also include ''restructuring'' as a credit event, whereas trades referencing North American [[high yield]] corporate reference entities typically do not.  The definition of restructuring is quite technical but is essentially intended to respond to circumstances where a reference entity, as a result of the deterioration of its credit, negotiates changes in the terms in its debt with its creditors as an alternative to formal insolvency proceedings (i.e., the debt is ''restructured'').  This practice is far more typical in jurisdictions that do not provide protective status to insolvent debtors similar to that provided by [[Chapter 11]] of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]].  In particular, concerns arising out of [[Conseco]]'s restructuring in 2000 led to the credit event's removal from North American high yield trades.<ref>[http://www.financewise.com/public/edit/riskm/credit/march01/story2.htm, Financewise.com]</ref>

Finally, standard CDS contracts specify ''deliverable obligation characteristics'' that limit the range of obligations that a protection buyer may deliver upon a credit event.  Trading conventions for deliverable obligation characteristics vary for different markets and CDS contract types.  Typical limitations include that deliverable debt be a bond or loan, that it have a maximum maturity of 30 years, that it not be subordinated, that it not be subject to transfer restrictions (other than [[Rule 144A]]), that it be of a standard currency and that it not be subject to some contingency before becoming due.

The premium payments are generally quarterly, with maturity dates (and likewise premium payment dates) falling on March 20, June 20, September 20, and December 20. Due to the proximity to the [[IMM dates]], which fall on the third Wednesday of these months, these CDS maturity dates are also referred to as "IMM dates".

==Settlement==
===Physical or cash===
As described in an earlier section, if a credit event occurs then CDS contracts can either be ''physically settled'' or ''cash settled''.<ref name="Deutsche Bank Report"/>

* Physical settlement:  The protection seller pays the buyer par value, and in return takes delivery of a debt obligation of the reference entity.  For example, a hedge fund has bought $5&nbsp;million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company.  In the event of a default, the bank will pay the hedge fund $5&nbsp;million cash, and the hedge fund must deliver $5&nbsp;million face value of senior debt of the company (typically bonds or loans, which will typically be worth very little given that the company is in default).
* Cash settlement:  The protection seller pays the buyer the difference between par value and the market price of a debt obligation of the reference entity.  For example, a hedge fund has bought $5&nbsp;million worth of protection from a bank on the senior debt of a company.  This company has now defaulted, and its senior bonds are now trading at 25 (i.e. 25 cents on the dollar) since the market believes that senior bondholders will receive 25% of the money they are owed once the company is wound up.  Therefore, the bank must pay the hedge fund $5&nbsp;million * (100%-25%) = $3.75&nbsp;million.

The development and growth of the CDS market has meant that on many companies there is now a much larger outstanding notional of CDS contracts than the outstanding notional value of its debt obligations.  (This is because many parties made CDS contracts for speculative purposes, without actually owning any debt for which they wanted to insure against default.)  For example, at the time it filed for bankruptcy on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers had approximately $155&nbsp;billion of outstanding debt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/99286-settlement-auction-for-lehman-cds-surprises-ahead |title=Settlement Auction for Lehman CDS: Surprises Ahead? |publisher=Seeking Alpha |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> but around $400&nbsp;billion notional value of CDS contracts had been written which referenced this debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7a268486-93cd-11dd-9a63-0000779fd18c,dwp_uuid=11f94e6e-7e94-11dd-b1af-000077b07658.html |title=/ In depth&nbsp;<U+2014> Fed to hold CDS clearance talks |publisher=Ft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  Clearly not all of these contracts could be physically settled, since there was not enough outstanding Lehman Brothers debt to fulfill all of the contracts, demonstrating the necessity for cash settled CDS trades.  The trade confirmation produced when a CDS is traded will state whether the contract is to be physically or cash settled.

===Auctions===
When a credit event occurs on a major company on which a lot of CDS contracts are written, an auction (also known as a ''credit-fixing event'') may be held to facilitate settlement of a large number of contracts at once, at a fixed cash settlement price.  During the auction process participating dealers (e.g., the big [[investment banks]]) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity's debt obligations, as well as net requests for physical settlement against par.  A second stage [[Dutch auction]] is held following the publication of the initial mid-point of the dealer markets and what is the net open interest to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans.  The final clearing point of this auction sets the final price for cash settlement of all CDS contracts and all physical settlement requests as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled.  According to the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as [[Lehman Brothers]] and [[Washington Mutual]].<ref name="isda.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.isda.org/press/press102108.html |title=Isda Ceo Notes Success Of Lehman Settlement, Addresses Cds Misperceptions |publisher=Isda.org |date=2008-10-21 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>

==Pricing and valuation==
There are two competing theories usually advanced for the pricing of credit default swaps. The first, referred to herein as the 'probability model', takes the present value of a series of cashflows weighted by their probability of non-default. This method suggests that credit default swaps should trade at a considerably lower spread than corporate bonds.

The second model, proposed by [[Darrell Duffie]], but also by [[John C. Hull|John Hull]] and White, uses a no-arbitrage approach.

===Probability model===
Under the probability model, a credit default swap is priced using a model that takes four inputs; this is similar to the [[rNPV]] (risk-adjusted NPV) model used in [[drug development]]:
*the "issue premium",
*the recovery rate (percentage of notional repaid in event of default),
*the "credit curve" for the reference entity and
*the "[[LIBOR]] curve".
If [[Default (finance)|default]] events never occurred the price of a CDS would simply be the sum of the [[Discounted cash flow|discounted]] premium payments. So CDS pricing models have to take into account the possibility of a default occurring some time between the effective date and maturity date of the CDS contract. For the purpose of explanation we can imagine the case of a one year CDS with effective date <math>t_0</math> with four quarterly premium payments occurring at times <math>t_1</math>, <math>t_2</math>, <math>t_3</math>, and <math>t_4</math>. If the nominal for the CDS is <math>N</math> and the issue premium is <math>c</math> then the size of the quarterly premium payments is <math>Nc/4</math>. If we assume for simplicity that defaults can only occur on one of the payment dates then there are five ways the contract could end:
*either it does not have any default at all, so the four premium payments are made and the contract survives until the maturity date, or
*a default occurs on the first, second, third or fourth payment date.

To price the CDS we now need to assign probabilities to the five possible outcomes, then calculate the present value of the payoff for each outcome. The present value of the CDS is then simply the [[present value]] of the five payoffs multiplied by their probability of occurring.

This is illustrated in the following tree diagram where at each payment date either the contract has a default event, in which case it ends with a payment of <math>N(1-R)</math> shown in red, where <math>R</math> is the recovery rate, or it survives without a default being triggered, in which case a premium payment of <math>Nc/4</math> is made, shown in blue. At either side of the diagram are the cashflows up to that point in time with premium payments in blue and default payments in red. If the contract is terminated the square is shown with solid shading.

[[File:Cds cashflows.svg|Cashflows for a Credit Default Swap.]]

The probability of surviving over the interval <math>t_{i-1}</math> to <math>t_i</math> without a default payment is <math>p_i</math> and the probability of a default being triggered is <math>1-p_i</math>. The calculation of present value, given [[discount factor]] of <math>\delta_1</math> to <math>\delta_4</math> is then

|}

The probabilities <math>p_1</math>, <math>p_2</math>, <math>p_3</math>, <math>p_4</math> can be calculated using the [[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]] curve. The probability of no default occurring over a time period from <math>t</math> to <math>t+\Delta t</math> [[Exponential decay|decays exponentially]] with a time-constant determined by the credit spread, or mathematically <math>p=exp(-s(t) \Delta t/(1-R))</math> where <math>s(t)</math> is the [[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]] zero curve at time <math>t</math>. The riskier the reference entity the greater the spread and the more rapidly the survival probability decays with time.

To get the total present value of the credit default swap we multiply the probability of each outcome by its present value to give

===No-arbitrage model===
In the 'no-arbitrage' model proposed by both Duffie, and Hull-White, it is assumed that there is no risk free arbitrage. Duffie uses the LIBOR as the risk free rate, whereas Hull and White use US Treasuries as the risk free rate. Both analyses make simplifying assumptions (such as the assumption that there is zero cost of unwinding the fixed leg of the swap on default), which may invalidate the no-arbitrage assumption. However the Duffie approach is frequently used by the market to determine theoretical prices. Under the Duffie construct, the price of a credit default swap can also be derived by calculating the asset swap spread of a bond. If a bond has a spread of 100, and the swap spread is 70 basis points, then a CDS contract should trade at 30. However there are sometimes technical reasons why this will not be the case, and this may or may not present an arbitrage opportunity for the canny investor. The difference between the theoretical model and the actual price of a credit default swap is known as the basis.

==Criticisms==
Critics of the huge credit default swap market have claimed that it has been allowed to become too large without proper regulation and that, because all contracts are privately negotiated, the market has no transparency.  Furthermore, there have even been claims that CDSs exacerbated the 2008 global financial crisis by hastening the demise of companies such as Lehman Brothers and [[American International Group|AIG]].<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/161199/output/]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} Phillips, Matthew. <U+201C>The Monster That Ate Wall Street.<U+201D> Newsweek. October 6, 2008. Retrieved March 17, 2009.</ref>

In the case of Lehman Brothers, it is claimed that the widening of the bank's CDS spread reduced confidence in the bank and ultimately gave it further problems that it was not able to overcome.  However, proponents of the CDS market argue that this confuses cause and effect; CDS spreads simply reflected the reality that the company was in serious trouble.  Furthermore, they claim that the CDS market allowed investors who had counterparty risk with Lehman Brothers to reduce their exposure in the case of their default.

Credit default swaps have also faced criticism that they contributed to a breakdown in negotiations during the GM bankruptcy, because bondholders would benefit from the credit event of a GM bankruptcy due to their holding of CDSs. Critics speculate that these creditors were incentivized into pushing for the company to enter bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/23/gannett-and-the-side-effects-of-default-swaps/| title=Gannett and the Side Effects of Default Swaps |date = June 23, 2009 | accessdate = July 14, 2009 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> Due to a lack of transparency, there was no way to find out who the protection buyers and protection writers were, and they were subsequently left out of the negotiation process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://firedoglake.com/2009/05/14/protecting-gm-from-credit-default-swap-holders/| title=Protecting GM from Credit Default Swap Holders publisher=Firedoglake |date = May 14, 2009 | accessdate = July 14, 2009 }}</ref>

It was also reported after Lehman's bankruptcy that the $400&nbsp;billion notional of CDS protection which had been written on the bank could lead to a net payout of $366&nbsp;billion from protection sellers to buyers (given the cash-settlement [[#Auctions|auction]] settled at a final price of 8.625%) and that these large payouts could lead to further bankruptcies of firms without enough cash to settle their contracts.<ref name="ft.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d96751f8-96f4-11dd-8cc4-000077b07658.html |title=/ Financials&nbsp;<U+2014> Lehman CDS pay-outs higher than expected |publisher=Ft.com |date=2008-10-10 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  However, industry estimates after the auction suggested that net cashflows would only be in the region of $7&nbsp;billion.<ref name="ft.com"/>  This is because many parties held offsetting positions; for example if a bank writes CDS protection on a company it is likely to then enter an offsetting transaction by buying protection on the same company in order to hedge its risk.  Furthermore, CDS deals are [[Mark-to-market|marked-to-market]] frequently.  This would have led to margin calls from buyers to sellers as Lehman's CDS spread widened, meaning that the net cashflows on the days after the auction are likely to have been even lower.<ref name="isda.org"/>...
Senior bankers have argued that not only has the CDS market functioned remarkably well during the financial crisis, but that CDS contracts have been acting to distribute risk just as was intended, and that it is not CDSs themselves that need further regulation, but the parties who trade them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/business/trading-floor/2556276/daily-brief.thtml| title=Daily Brief |date = October 28, 2008 | accessdate = November 6, 2008 }}</ref>

Some general criticism of financial derivatives is also relevant to credit derivatives.  [[Warren Buffett]] famously described derivatives bought speculatively as "financial weapons of mass destruction." In [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s annual report to shareholders in 2002, he said, "Unless derivatives contracts are collateralized or guaranteed, their ultimate value also depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties to them. In the meantime, though, before a contract is settled, the counterparties record profits and losses<U+2014>often huge in amount<U+2014>in their current earnings statements without so much as a penny changing hands. The range of derivatives contracts is limited only by the imagination of man (or sometimes, so it seems, madmen)."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2002ar/2002ar.pdf |format=PDF| title = Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but money does not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection.  [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]], the clearinghouse for the majority of trades in the US over-the-counter market, stated in October 2008 that once offsetting trades were considered, only an estimated $6&nbsp;billion would change hands on October 21, during the settlement of the CDS contracts issued on Lehman Brothers' debt, which amounted to somewhere between $150 to $360&nbsp;billion.<ref>Kim Asger Olsen.

===Systemic risk===
The risk of counterparties defaulting has been amplified during the [[Global financial crisis of 2008|2008 financial crisis]], particularly because Lehman Brothers and AIG were counterparties in a very large number of CDS transactions.  This is an example of [[systemic risk]], risk which threatens an entire market, and a number of commentators have argued that size and deregulation of the CDS market have increased this risk.

For example, imagine if a hypothetical [[mutual fund]] had bought some [[Washington Mutual]] corporate bonds in 2005 and decided to hedge their exposure by buying CDS protection from Lehman Brothers. After Lehman's default, this protection was no longer active, and Washington Mutual's sudden default only days later would have led to a massive loss on the bonds, a loss that should have been insured by the CDS.  There was also fear that Lehman Brothers and AIG's inability to pay out on CDS contracts would lead to the unraveling of complex interlinked chain of CDS transactions between financial institutions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Investing Daily |url=http://kciinvesting.com/articles/9432/1/AIG-the-Global-Financial-System-and-Investor-Anxiety/Page1.html |title=AIG, the Global Financial System and Investor Anxiety |publisher=Kciinvesting.com |date=2008-09-16 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>  So far this does not appear to have happened, although some commentators{{Who|date=November 2009}} have noted that because the total CDS exposure of a bank is not public knowledge, the fear that one could face large losses or possibly even default themselves was a contributing factor to the massive decrease in lending liquidity during September/October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sam Fleming, Daily Mail16 October 2008, 12:00am Data |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/investing-and-markets/article.html?in_article_id=455675&in_page_id=3 |title=Banks caught in jaws of CDS menace |publisher=This is Money |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref>

Chains of CDS transactions can arise from a practice known as "netting".<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96395271&ft=1&f=94427042 Unregulated Credit Default Swaps Led to Weakness].  All things Considered, National Public Radio.  Oct 31, 2008.</ref>  Here, company B may buy a CDS from company A with a certain annual "premium", say 2%.  If the condition of the reference company worsens, the risk premium will rise, so company B can sell a CDS to company C with a premium of say, 5%, and pocket the 3% difference.  However, if the reference company defaults, company B might not have the assets on hand to make good on the contract.  It depends on its contract with company A to provide a large payout, which it then passes along to company C.  The problem lies if one of the companies in the chain fails, creating a "[[domino effect]]" of losses.  For example, if company A fails, company B will default on its CDS contract to company C, possibly resulting in bankruptcy, and company C will potentially experience a large loss due to the failure to receive compensation for the bad debt it held from the reference company.  Even worse, because CDS contracts are private, company C will not know that its fate is tied to company A; it is only doing business with company B.

As described [[#Market|above]], the establishment of a central exchange or clearing house for CDS trades would help to solve the "domino effect" problem, since it would mean that all trades faced a central counterparty guaranteed by a consortium of dealers.

==Tax and accounting issues==
The U.S federal income tax treatment of credit default swaps is uncertain.<ref>Nirenberg, David Z. & Steven L. Kopp. <U+201C>Credit Derivatives: Tax Treatment of Total Return Swaps, Default Swaps, and Credit-Linked Notes,<U+201D> Journal of Taxation, Aug. 1997: 1.  Peaslee, James M. & David Z. Nirenberg. <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Federal Income Taxation of Securitization Transactions:</span> Cumulative Supplement No. 7, November 26, 2007, http://www.securitizationtax.com: 85.  Retrieved July 28, 2008. Ari J. Brandes. ''A Better Way to Understand Credit Default Swaps.'' Tax Notes (July 21, 2008). Earlier version of paper available at: [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121263].</ref>  Commentators generally believe that, depending on how they are drafted, they are either [[notional principal contract]]s or [[Option (finance)|options]] for tax purposes,<ref>Peaslee & Nirenberg, 129.</ref> but this is not certain.  There is a risk of having credit default swaps recharacterized as different types of financial instruments because they resemble put options and credit guarantees.  In particular, the degree of risk depends on the type of settlement (physical/cash and binary/FMV) and trigger (default only/any credit event).<ref>Nirenberg & Kopp, 8.</ref>  If a credit default swap is a notional principal contract, periodic and nonperiodic payments on the swap are deductible and included in ordinary income.<ref name=autogenerated2>''Id.''</ref>  If a payment is a termination payment, its tax treatment is even more uncertain.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  In 2004, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] announced that it was studying the characterization of credit default swaps in response to taxpayer confusion,<ref>Peaslee & Nirenberg, 89.</ref> but it has not yet issued any guidance on their characterization.  A taxpayer must include income from credit default swaps in ordinary income if the swaps are connected with trade or business in the United States.<ref>Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, at the IRS website.  <U+201C>2007 Instructions for Form 1042-S: Foreign Person<U+2019>s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,<U+201D> http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1042s_07.pdf: 4. Retrieved July 28, 2008.</ref>

The accounting treatment of Credit Default Swaps used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility.  For example, GAAP generally require that Credit Default Swaps be reported on a [[mark to market]] basis.  In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into the [[income statement]] and [[balance sheet]] as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try to account for the CDS as a hedge under FASB 133<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fasb.org/st/summary/stsum133.shtml |title=FASB 133 |publisher=Fasb.org |date=1999-06-15 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}</ref> but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.

==LCDS==
A new type of default swap is the "loan only" credit default swap (LCDS). This is conceptually very similar to a standard CDS, but unlike "vanilla" CDS, the underlying protection is sold on syndicated secured loans of the Reference Entity rather than the broader category of "Bond or Loan". Also, as of May 22, 2007, for the most widely traded LCDS form, which governs North American single name and index trades, the default settlement method for LCDS shifted to auction settlement rather than physical settlement.  The auction method is essentially the same that has been used in the various ISDA cash settlement auction protocols, but does not require parties to take any additional steps following a credit event (i.e., adherence to a protocol) to elect cash settlement.  On October 23, 2007, the first ever LCDS auction was held for [[Movie Gallery]].<ref>[http://www.creditfixings.com/information/affiliations/fixings/auctions/2007/movie_gallery.html ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

Because LCDS trades are linked to secured obligations with much higher recovery values than the unsecured bond obligations that are typically assumed to be cheapest to deliver in respect of vanilla CDS, LCDS spreads are generally much tighter than CDS trades on the same name.
