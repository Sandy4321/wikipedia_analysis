Smallpox localizes in small [[blood vessel]]s of the skin and in the mouth and throat. In the skin, this results in a characteristic [[maculopapular]] rash, and later, raised fluid-filled [[blister]]s. ''V. major'' produces a more serious disease and has an overall [[mortality rate]] of 30<U+2013>35%. ''V. minor'' causes a milder form of disease (also known as '''[[alastrim]]''', '''cottonpox''', '''milkpox''', '''whitepox''', and '''Cuban itch''') which kills about 1% of its victims.<ref name=Behbehani_1983>{{cite journal |author=Behbehani AM |title=The smallpox story: life and death of an old disease |journal=Microbiol Rev |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=455<U+2013>509 |date=1 December 1983|pmid=6319980 |pmc=281588 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6319980 }}</ref><ref name=AFIP/> Long-term complications of ''V. major'' infection include characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65<U+2013>85% of survivors.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jezek Z, Hardjotanojo W, Rangaraj AG |title=Facial scarring after varicella.

== Classification ==
There are two clinical forms of smallpox. Variola major is the severe and most common form, with a more extensive rash and higher fever. [[Alastrim|Variola minor]] is a less common presentation, and a much less severe disease, with historical death rates of 1% or less.<ref name=FactSheet>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp |title=CDC Smallpox |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |work=Smallpox Overview }}</ref> Subclinical ([[asymptomatic]]) infections with variola virus have been noted, but are not common.<ref name= PinkBook/> In addition, a form called ''variola sine eruptione'' (smallpox without rash) is seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form is marked by a fever that occurs after the usual incubation period and can be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.<ref name= PinkBook/>
[[Image:Smallpox child.jpg|thumb|Child showing rash due to ordinary-type smallpox (variola major)]]

== Signs and symptoms ==

The [[incubation period]] between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the [[respiratory]] mucosa, migrates to regional [[lymph nodes]], and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, [[lysis]] of many infected cells occurs and the virus is found in the [[blood]]stream in large numbers (this is called ''[[viremia]]''), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, [[bone marrow]], and lymph nodes. The initial or prodromal symptoms are similar to other viral diseases such as [[influenza]] and the [[common cold]]: [[fever]] (at least {{convert|38.5|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0}}), [[myalgia|muscle pain]], malaise, headache and [[prostration]]. As the [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive tract]] is commonly involved, nausea and vomiting and backache often occur. The prodrome, or preeruptive stage, usually lasts 2<U+2013>4 days. By days 12<U+2013>15 the first visible lesions<U+2014>small reddish spots called ''[[enanthem]]''<U+2014>appear on mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, [[palate]], and throat, and temperature falls to near normal. These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture, releasing large amounts of virus into the [[saliva]].<ref name= AFIP/>

Smallpox virus preferentially attacks skin cells, causing the characteristic pimples (called [[macule]]s) associated with the disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear.<ref name= AFIP/> At this point Variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification:<ref>Rao, A. R. (1972). Smallpox. Bombay: Kothari Book Depot. {{Oclc|723806}}</ref> ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall [[fatality rate]] of about 30%; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.<ref name=eMedicine_Smallpox>{{cite web | author = Hogan CJ, Harchelroad F | title=CBRNE - Smallpox | work=eMedicine | url=http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic885.htm | accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

=== Ordinary ===
Ninety percent or more of smallpox cases among unvaccinated persons are of the ordinary type.<ref name= PinkBook/> In this form of the disease, by the second day of the rash, the macules become raised ''[[papule]]s''. By the third or fourth day the papules fill with an opalescent fluid to become ''[[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]]''. This fluid becomes [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and [[turbid]] within 24<U+2013>48 hours, giving them the appearance of [[pustule]]s; however, the so-called pustules are filled with tissue debris, not pus.<ref name= AFIP/>

By the sixth or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between 7 and 10 days the pustules mature and reach their maximum size. The pustules are sharply raised, typically round, tense, and firm to the touch. The pustules are deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaks from the pustules, and by the end of the second week the pustules deflate, and start to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16-20 scabs have formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving [[depigmentation|depigmented]] scars.<ref name=training1>{{cite web |url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/diseasemgmt.pdf |title=Smallpox Disease and Its Clinical Management |accessdate=2007-12-26 |format=PDF |work=From the training course titled "Smallpox: Disease, Prevention, and Intervention" (www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview)}}</ref>

Ordinary smallpox generally produces a discrete rash, in which the pustules stand out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash is densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are involved in the majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merge together into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which begin to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remain ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62%.<ref name= PinkBook/>

=== Modified ===
Referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development, modified smallpox occurs mostly in previously vaccinated people. In this form the prodromal illness still occurs but may be less severe than in the ordinary type. There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash. The skin lesions tend to be fewer and evolve more quickly, are more superficial, and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical smallpox.<ref name=training1/> Modified smallpox is rarely, if ever, fatal. This form of variola major is more easily confused with [[chickenpox]].<ref name= PinkBook/>

=== Malignant ===
[[Image:Hemorrhagic smallpox.jpg|thumb|This man is suffering from severe hemorrhagic-type smallpox.]]
In Malignant-type smallpox (also called flat smallpox) the lesions remain almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles form in the ordinary-type . It is unknown why some people develop this type. Historically, it accounted for 5%<U+2013>10% of cases, and the majority (72%) were children.<ref name= Fenner1>{{cite book |author=Fenner, Frank |title=Smallpox and Its Eradication (History of International Public Health, No. 6) |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106.pdf |year=1988 |pages= |isbn=92-4-156110-6 |format=PDF}}</ref> Malignant smallpox is accompanied by a severe [[prodromal]] phase that lasts 3<U+2013>4 days, prolonged high fever, and severe symptoms of [[toxemia]]. The rash on the tongue and palate is extensive. Skin lesions mature slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they are flat and appear to be buried in the skin. Unlike ordinary-type smallpox, the vesicles contain little fluid, are soft and velvety to the touch, and may contain hemorrhages. Malignant smallpox is nearly always fatal.<ref name= PinkBook/>

=== Hemorrhagic ===
[[Hemorrhagic]] smallpox is a severe form that is accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2% of infections and occurred mostly in adults.<ref name= PinkBook/> In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black,<ref name= PinkBook/> hence this form of the disease is also known as [[black pox]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In the early, or fulminating form, hemorrhaging appears on the second or third day as sub-[[conjunctival]] bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky [[erythema]], [[petechiae]], and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, [[serosa]], muscle, and, rarely, the [[epicardium]], [[liver]], [[testes]], [[ovaries]] and [[bladder]]. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8<U+2013>10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage.<ref name= PinkBook/> Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in [[coagulation factor]]s (e.g. [[platelet]]s, [[prothrombin]], and [[globulin]]) and an increase in circulating [[antithrombin]]. Patients in the late stage have significant [[thrombocytopenia]]; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin.<ref name= AFIP/> This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25% of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain.<ref name=eMedicine_Smallpox/> Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.<ref name= PinkBook/>

Smallpox is caused by infection with variola virus, which belongs to the genus [[Orthopoxvirus]], the family [[Poxviridae]] and subfamily chordopoxvirinae. Variola is a large brick-shaped virus measuring approximately 302 to 350 [[nanometer]]s by 244 to 270&nbsp;nm,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dubochet J, Adrian M, Richter K, Garces J, Wittek R |title=Structure of intracellular mature vaccinia virus observed by cryoelectron microscopy |journal=J.

Four orthopoxviruses cause infection in humans: variola, [[vaccinia]], [[cowpox]], and [[monkeypox]]. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates and other animals have been infected in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.<ref name = PinkBook>{{cite book | author = Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S (eds.) | chapter = Smallpox | title = Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (The Pink Book) | edition = 9th | pages = 281<U+2013>306 | publisher = Public Health Foundation | location =Washington DC |year = 2005 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/smallpox.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>

The lifecycle of poxviruses is complicated by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell rather than in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other [[DNA viruses]], the most important of which is a viral-associated [[DNA-dependent RNA polymerase]].
Both [[viral envelope|enveloped]] and unenveloped virions are infectious. The viral envelope is made of modified [[Golgi]] membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including [[hemagglutinin]].<ref name=Moss/> Infection with either variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.<ref name=AFIP>{{cite web |url=http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071009141639/http://www.afip.org/Departments/infectious/sp/text/1_1.htm |archivedate=2007-10-09 |title=Smallpox |accessdate=2008-10-28 |work=Armed Forces Institute of Pathology: Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases}}</ref>

=== Transmission ===
Transmission occurs through inhalation of airborne variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or [[pharynx|pharyngeal]] [[mucosa]] of an infected person. It is transmitted from one person to another primarily through prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person, usually within a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m), but can also be spread through direct contact with infected [[bodily fluid]]s or contaminated objects ([[fomite]]s) such as bedding or clothing. Rarely, smallpox has been spread by virus carried in the air in enclosed settings such as buildings, buses, and trains.<ref name= FactSheet/> The virus can cross the [[placenta]], but the incidence of [[congenital]] smallpox is relatively low.<ref name=AFIP/>
Smallpox is not notably infectious in the [[prodrome|prodromal]] period and viral shedding is usually delayed until the appearance of the rash, which is often accompanied by [[lesion]]s in the mouth and pharynx. The virus can be transmitted throughout the course of the illness, but is most frequent during the first week of the rash, when most of the skin lesions are intact.<ref name= PinkBook/> Infectivity wanes in 7 to 10 days when scabs form over the lesions, but the infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab falls off.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Henderson DA, Inglesby TV, Bartlett JG, ''et al.'' |title=Smallpox as a biological weapon: medical and public health management. Working Group on Civilian Biodefense |journal=JAMA |volume=281 |issue=22 |pages=2127<U+2013>37 |year=1999 |pmid=10367824 |doi=10.1001/jama.281.22.2127 |last12=Parker |first12=G |last13=Perl |first13=T |last14=Russell |first14=PK |last15=Tonat |first15=K }}</ref>

Smallpox is highly contagious, but generally spreads more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases, perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after the onset of the rash. The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage.                                    In [[temperate]] areas, the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring. In tropical areas, seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year.<ref name= PinkBook/> Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on [[acquired immunity]]. [[Vaccination]] [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] declines over time and is probably lost in all but the most recently vaccinated populations.<ref name=AFIP/> Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no [[asymptomatic carrier]] state.<ref name= PinkBook/>

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical definition of smallpox is an illness with acute onset of fever greater than 101<U+00B0>F (38.3<U+00B0>C) followed by a rash characterized by firm, deep seated vesicles or pustules in the same stage of development without other apparent cause.<ref name= PinkBook/> If a clinical case is observed, smallpox is confirmed using laboratory tests.

[[Microscope|Microscopically]], poxviruses produce characteristic [[cytoplasmic]] inclusions, the most important of which are known as [[Guarnieri bodies]], and are the sites of [[viral replication]]. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Riedel S |title=Smallpox and biological warfare: a disease revisited |journal=Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent) |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=13<U+2013>20 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=16200143 |pmc=1200695 |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by [[electron microscopy|electron microscopic]] examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy.<ref name=AFIP/>

Definitive laboratory identification of variola virus involves growing the virus on [[chorioallantoic membrane]] (part of a chicken [[embryo]]) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/smallpox/biofacts/smllpx-summary.html#_Criteria_for_Determining |title= Smallpox: Current, comprehensive information on pathogenesis, microbiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis |accessdate=2007-12-27 |work= Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy}}</ref> Strains may be characterized by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis.

[[Chickenpox]] was commonly confused with smallpox in the immediate post-eradication era. Chickenpox and smallpox can be distinguished by several methods. Unlike smallpox, chickenpox does not usually affect the palms and soles. Additionally, chickenpox pustules are of varying size due to variations in the timing of pustule eruption: smallpox pustules are all very nearly the same size since the viral effect progresses more uniformly. A variety of laboratory methods are available for detecting chickenpox in evaluation of suspected smallpox cases.<ref name= PinkBook/>

[[File:Smallpox vaccine.jpg|thumb|Components of a modern smallpox [[vaccination]] kit including the [[diluent]], a vial of Dryvax vaccinia vaccine, and a bifurcated needle.]]
The earliest procedure used to prevent smallpox was [[inoculation]] (also known as variolation). Inoculation was possibly practiced in India as early as 1000 BC,<ref name=Bourzac_2002>{{cite journal | author = Bourzac K| title = Smallpox: Historical Review of a Potential Bioterrorist Tool | journal = Journal of Young Investigators | year = 2002 | volume = 6 | issue = 3 |url= http://www.jyi.org/volumes/volume6/issue3/features/bourzac.html}}</ref> and involved either nasal [[Wiktionary:insufflation|insufflation]] of powdered smallpox scabs, or scratching material from a smallpox lesion into the skin. However, this idea has been challenged as few of the ancient [[Sanskrit]] medical texts of India described the process of inoculation.<ref>Wujastyk, Dominik. (1995).

[[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] observed smallpox inoculation during her stay in the [[Ottoman Empire]], writing detailed accounts of the practice in her letters, and enthusiastically promoted the procedure in England upon her return in 1718.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/mod/montagu-smallpox.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762): Smallpox Vaccination in Turkey |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> In 1796 [[Edward Jenner]], a doctor in [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire]], rural England, discovered that immunity to smallpox could be produced by inoculating a person with material from a [[cowpox]] lesion. Cowpox is a poxvirus in the same family as variola. Jenner called the material used for inoculation [[vaccine]], from the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] ''vacca'', which is [[Latin]] for cow. The procedure was much safer than variolation, and did not involve a risk of smallpox transmission. Vaccination to prevent smallpox was soon practiced all over the world. During the 19th century, the cowpox virus used for smallpox vaccination was replaced by [[vaccinia virus]]. Vaccinia is in the same family as cowpox and variola but is [[Genetics|genetic]]ally distinct from both. The origin of vaccinia virus and how it came to be in the vaccine are not known.<ref name= PinkBook/>
[[File:Variolation vial India.jpg|thumb|Vial containing [[variolation]] material (India)]]

The current formulation of smallpox vaccine is a live virus preparation of infectious vaccinia virus. The vaccine is given using a bifurcated (two-pronged) needle that is dipped into the vaccine solution. The needle is used to prick the skin (usually the upper arm) a number of times in a few seconds. If successful, a red and itchy bump develops at the vaccine site in three or four days. In the first week, the bump becomes a large blister (called a <U+201C>Jennerian vesicle<U+201D>) which fills with pus, and begins to drain. During the second week, the blister begins to dry up and a scab forms. The scab falls off in the third week, leaving a small scar.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The [[antibodies]] induced by vaccinia vaccine are cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses (such as monkeypox, cowpox, and variola (smallpox) viruses). Neutralizing antibodies are detectable 10 days after first-time vaccination, and seven days after revaccination. Historically, the vaccine has been effective in preventing smallpox infection in 95% of those vaccinated.<ref name= CDCvac/> Smallpox vaccination provides a high level of immunity for three to five years and decreasing immunity thereafter. If a person is vaccinated again later, immunity lasts even longer. Studies of smallpox cases in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated that the fatality rate among persons vaccinated less than 10 years before exposure was 1.3%; it was 7% among those vaccinated 11 to 20 years prior, and 11% among those vaccinated 20 or more years prior to infection. By contrast, 52% of unvaccinated persons died.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mack TM |title=Smallpox in Europe, 1950<U+2013>1971 |journal=J. Infect. Dis. |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=161<U+2013>9 |year=1972 |pmid=5007552 }}</ref>

There are side effects and risks associated with the smallpox vaccine. In the past, about 1 out of 1,000 people vaccinated for the first time experienced serious, but non-life-threatening, reactions including toxic or [[allergic reaction]] at the site of the vaccination ([[erythema multiforme]]), spread of the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body, and to other individuals. Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198%) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial [[encephalitis]] or severe [[necrosis]] in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).<ref name= CDCvac/>

Given these risks, as smallpox became effectively eradicated and the number of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s.<ref name=WHO_Factsheet/><ref>{{cite journal |author=P<U+00FC>tz MM, Alberini I, Midgley CM, Manini I, Montomoli E, [[Geoffrey L.

==Treatment==
Smallpox vaccination within three days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease.<ref name=CDCvac>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccination/pdf/vaccine-overview.pdf |format=PDF|title=Vaccine Overview |accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=Smallpox Fact Sheet}}</ref> Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible [[ventilator]] assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], such as [[Fluid replacement|fluid resuscitation]]. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin [[burn]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

No drug is currently approved for the treatment of smallpox. However, [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] treatments have improved since the last large smallpox epidemics, and studies suggest that the antiviral drug [[cidofovir]] might be useful as a therapeutic agent. The drug must be administered [[intravenously]], however, and may cause serious [[renal]] toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bray M, Roy CJ |title=Antiviral prophylaxis of smallpox |url= http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/54/1/1 |journal=J.

== Prognosis ==
The overall case-fatality rate for ordinary-type smallpox is about 30%, but varies by pock distribution: ordinary type-confluent is fatal about 50<U+2013>75% of the time, ordinary-type semi-confluent about 25<U+2013>50% of the time, in cases where the rash is discrete the case-fatality rate is less than 10%. The overall fatality rate for children younger than 1 year of age is 40%<U+2013>50%. Hemorrhagic and flat types have the highest fatality rates. The fatality rate for flat-type is 90% or greater and nearly 100% is observed in cases of hemorrhagic smallpox. The case-fatality rate for variola minor is 1% or less.<ref name=training1/> There is no evidence of chronic or recurrent infection with variola virus.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In fatal cases of ordinary smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth days of the illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating [[immune complex]]es, overwhelming [[viremia]], or an uncontrolled [[immune response]] may be contributing factors.<ref name=PinkBook/> In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved [[heart failure]], sometimes accompanied by [[pulmonary edema]]. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe [[platelet]] loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death.<ref name= Fenner1/> In flat smallpox modes of death are similar to those in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and [[electrolyte]]s beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating [[sepsis]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

=== Complications ===
Complications of smallpox arise most commonly in the [[respiratory system]] and range from simple [[bronchitis]] to fatal [[pneumonia]]. Respiratory
complications tend to develop on about the eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary [[bacteria]]l infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication of smallpox. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.<ref name=PinkBook/>

Other complications include [[encephalitis]] (1 in 500 patients), which is more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2% of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, [[conjunctiva]], and [[cornea]], leading to complications such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[keratitis]], [[corneal ulcer]], [[iritis]], [[iridocyclitis]], and optic [[atrophy]]. [[Blindness]] results in approximately 35% to 40% of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and [[retina]]l hemorrhages. In 2% to 5% of young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing ''[[osteomyelitis]] variolosa''. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, [[tibia]], and [[fibula]], and characteristically cause separation of an [[epiphysis]] and marked [[periosteum|periosteal]] reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and [[arthritis]] may lead to limb deformities, [[ankylosis]], malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.<ref name=AFIP/>

By the mid-18th century smallpox was a major [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic disease]] everywhere in the world except in Australia and in several small islands. In Europe smallpox was a leading cause of death in the 18th century, killing an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stanley A Plotkin, Walter A Orenstein, Donald A. Henderson, Bernard Moss |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3 |title=Smallpox and Vaccinia |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref> Through the century smallpox resulted in the deaths of perhaps 10% of all the infants of [[Sweden]] every year,<ref name=Hays/> and the death rate of infants in [[Russia]] may have been ever higher.<ref name=Hopkins_2002/> The widespread use of [[variolation]] in a few countries, notably Great Britain, its North American colonies, and China, somewhat reduced the impact of smallpox among the wealthy classes during the latter part of the 18th century, but a real reduction in its incidence did not occur until vaccination became a common practice toward the end of the 19th century. Improved vaccines and the practice of re-vaccination led to a substantial reduction in cases in Europe and North America, but smallpox remained almost unchecked everywhere else in the world. In the United States and South Africa a much milder form of smallpox, ''variola minor'', was recognized just before the close of the 19th century. By the mid-20th century ''variola minor'' occurred along with ''variola major'', in varying proportions, in many parts of Africa. Patients with ''variola minor'' experience only a mild systemic illness, are often [[walk|ambulant]] throughout the course of the disease, and are therefore able to more easily spread disease. Infection with ''v. minor'' induces immunity against the more deadly ''variola major'' form. Thus as ''v. minor'' spread all over the USA, into Canada, the South American countries and Great Britain it became the dominant form of smallpox, further reducing mortality rates.<ref name= Fenner1/>

===Eradication===

Since Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of cowpox to protect humans from smallpox in 1796, various attempts were made to eliminate smallpox on a regional scale. As early as 1803, the Spanish Crown organized a mission (the [[Balmis expedition]]) to transport the vaccine to the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] in the Americas and the Philippines, and establish mass vaccination programs there.<ref>[http://www.doh.gov.ph/sphh/balmis.htm Dr. Francisco de Balmis and his Mission of Mercy, Society of Philippine Health History]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> The [[US Congress]] passed the [[Vaccine Act of 1813]] to ensure that safe smallpox vaccine would be available to the American public.

[[File:Rahima Banu.jpg|thumb|left|Two-year old [[Rahima Banu]] of Bangladesh was the last person infected with naturally occurring ''Variola major'', in 1975]]
To eradicate smallpox, each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading, by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by. This process is known as "ring vaccination". The key to this strategy was monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases, as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities. The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection, and that [[asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] did not exist, played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox. The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. Early on donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States, but by 1973, more than 80% of all vaccine was produced in developing countries.<ref name=Plotkin_1999/>

The last major European outbreak of smallpox was in [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|1972 in Yugoslavia]], after a pilgrim from [[Kosovo]] returned from the Middle East, where he had contracted the virus.

By the end of 1975, smallpox persisted only in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Conditions were very difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and vaccination program was undertaken in early and mid-1977. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (''Variola minor'') was diagnosed in [[Ali Maow Maalin]], a hospital cook in Merca, [[Somalia]], on 26 October 1977.<ref name= PinkBook/> The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly ''Variola major'' had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old [[Bangladesh]]i girl, [[Rahima Banu]].<ref name=PrestonNY>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Preston |authorlink=Richard Preston |coauthors= |title=A reporter at large: Demon in the Freezer |url=http://cryptome.org/smallpox-wmd.htm |work=The New Yorker |publisher= |date=12 July 1999 |accessdate=2008-01-03 }}</ref>

==Biological warfare==
The British at least considered using smallpox as a [[biological warfare]] agent at the [[Pontiac's Rebellion#Siege of Fort Pitt|Siege of Fort Pitt]] during the [[French and Indian Wars]] (1754<U+2013>63) against France and its [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] allies.<ref>Peckham, ''Indian Uprising'', 226; Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 542, 809n.</ref><ref>Anderson, ''Crucible of War'', 809n; Grenier, ''First Way of War'', 144; Nester, ''Haughty Conquerors"'', 114<U+2013>15.</ref> Although it is not clear whether the actual use of smallpox had official sanction, on June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader, wrote, "Out of our regard for them [sc. representatives of the besieging Delawares], we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital.

During [[World War II]], scientists from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usamriid.detrick.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20Blue%20Book%205th%20Edition.pdf |format=PDF|title= USAMRIID<U+2019>s Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=}}</ref> Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide-scale availability of a [[vaccine]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/coldwar/pox_weapon_02.shtml |title=BBC - History - Silent Weapon: Smallpox and Biological Warfare |accessdate=2008-01-02 |work=}}</ref>

In 1947 the [[Soviet Union]] established a smallpox weapons factory in the city of [[Zagorsk]], 75&nbsp;km to the northeast of Moscow.<ref name="Alibek">{{cite book |author=[[Kenneth Alibek|Alibek K]], Handelman S |title=Biohazard: The Chilling True Story of the Largest Covert Biological Weapons Program in the World<U+2014>Told from Inside by the Man Who Ran It |publisher=Delta |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-385-33496-6}}</ref> An outbreak of weaponized smallpox possibly occurred during testing at the factory in the 1970s. General Prof. Peter Burgasov, former Chief Sanitary Physician of the [[Soviet Army]] and a senior researcher within the [[Soviet program of biological weapons]], described the incident:

: <U+201C>On [[Vozrozhdeniya Island]] in the [[Aral Sea]], the strongest recipes of smallpox were tested. Suddenly I was informed that there were mysterious cases of mortalities in [[Aralsk]]. A research ship of the Aral fleet came to within 15 km of the island (it was forbidden to come any closer than 40 km). The lab technician of this ship took samples of plankton twice a day from the top deck. The smallpox formulation<U+2014>400 gr. of which was exploded on the island<U+2014><U+201D>got her<U+201D> and she became infected. After returning home to Aralsk, she infected several people including children. All of them died. I suspected the reason for this and called the Chief of General Staff of Ministry of Defense and requested to forbid the stop of the [[Alma-Ata]]<U+2014>Moscow train in Aralsk. As a result, the epidemic around the country was prevented. I called [[Yuri Andropov|Andropov]], who at that time was Chief of KGB, and informed him of the exclusive recipe of smallpox obtained on Vozrazhdenie Island.<U+201D><ref name="Shoham">{{cite journal |author=Shoham D, Wolfson Z |title=The Russian biological weapons program: vanished or disappeared? |journal=Crit.

Responding to international pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint US-British inspection team to tour four of its main weapons facilities at [[Biopreparat]]. The inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists, and were eventually ordered out of the facility.<ref name= Preston/> In 1992 Soviet defector [[Ken Alibek]] confirmed that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile<U+2014>as much as twenty tons<U+2014>of weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines), along with refrigerated [[warhead]]s to deliver it. It is not known whether these stockpiles still exist in Russia. In 1997, however, the Russian government announced that all of its remaining smallpox samples would be moved to the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR|Vector Institute]] in [[Koltsovo]].<ref name= Preston>{{Cite book  | last1 = Preston | first1 = Richard | title = The Demon in the Freezer | date =  | publisher = Fawcett | location =  | isbn = 0-345-46663-2 | pages = 105<U+2013>115 }}</ref> With the breakup of the Soviet Union and unemployment of many of the weapons program's scientists, there is concern that smallpox and the expertise to weaponize it may have become available to other governments or terrorist groups who might wish to use virus as means of biological warfare.<ref name= CDCcourse>[http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/training/overview/pdf/eradicationhistory.pdf  History and Epidemiology of Global Smallpox Eradication] From the training course titled "Smallpox: Disease, Prevention, and Intervention".

==Notable cases==
Famous historical figures who contracted smallpox include Lakota Chief [[Sitting Bull]], [[Ramses V]] of [[Egypt]],<ref name=Koplow>{{cite book | last = Koplow | first = David | title = Smallpox: The Fight to Eradicate a Global Scourge | publisher = University of California Press | year= 2003|location = Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA |isbn = 0-520-23732-3 }}</ref> the [[Kangxi Emperor]] (survived), [[Shunzhi Emperor]] and [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (refer to the official history) of China, [[Date Masamune]] of Japan (who lost an eye to the disease). [[Cuitl<U+00E1>huac]], the 10th [[tlatoani]] (ruler) of the [[Aztec]] city of [[Tenochtitlan]], died of smallpox in 1520, shortly after its introduction to the [[Americas]], and the Incan emperor [[Huayna Capac]] died of it in 1527. More recent public figures include: [[Guru Har Krishan]], 8th Guru of the Sikhs, in 1664, [[George Washington]], [[Peter II of Russia]] in 1730 (died),<ref name="doctorzebra.com">{{cite web | title = President Abraham Lincoln: Health & Medical History| url = http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g16.htm#25 | date= 2007-03-24 | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> and [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777. 

Prominent families throughout the world often had several people infected by and/or perish from the disease. For example, several relatives of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] survived the disease but were scarred by it. These include his sister [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret, Queen of Scotland]], his fourth wife, [[Anne of Cleves]], and his two daughters: [[Mary I of England]] in 1527 and [[Elizabeth I of England]] in 1562 (as an adult she would often try to disguise the pockmarks with heavy makeup). His great-niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], contracted the disease as a child but had no visible scarring.

In Europe, deaths from smallpox often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], died from complications shortly after apparently recovering from the disease, thereby rendering his sire's infamous efforts to provide England with a male heir moot. (His immediate successors were all females.) [[Louis XV of France]] succeeded his great-grandfather [[Louis XIV]] through a series of deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. [[William III of England|William III]] lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle [[Charles II of England|Charles]] as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, [[Mary II of England]], died from smallpox as well.  

In China, the [[Qing Dynasty]] had extensive protocols to protect [[Manchu]]s from the [[Peking]]'s endemic smallpox. Most notably, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] was promoted to the throne because he had survived the disease, ahead of older brothers who had not yet had it.

U.S. Presidents [[George Washington]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] all contracted and recovered from the disease. Washington became infected with smallpox on a visit to Barbados in 1751.<ref name="Michael B. A. Oldstone">{{cite book | title=Viruses, Plagues, and History| last=Oldstone| first=Michael| year=2010| pages=65<U+2013>71| publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn=0195327314, ISBN 9780195327311}}</ref> Jackson developed the illness after being taken prisoner by the British during the American Revolution, and though he recovered, his brother Robert did not.<ref name="Michael B. A. Oldstone"/> Lincoln contracted the disease during his Presidency, possibly from his son Tad, and was quarantined shortly after giving the Gettysburg address in 1863.<ref name="Michael B. A.

Famous theologian Jonathan Edwards died of smallpox in 1758 following an inoculation.

[[U.S.S.R.]] leader [[Stalin]] fell ill with smallpox at the age of seven. His face was badly scarred by the disease. He later had photographs retouched to make his pockmarks less apparent.<ref>Montefiore, Young Stalin, p. 61</ref>

Hungarian poet [[Ferenc K<U+00F6>lcsey]], who wrote the Hungarian national anthem, lost his right eye to smallpox.<ref>Szinnyei J<U+00F3>zsef:  [http://mek.niif.hu/03600/03630/html/k/k12495.htm Magyar <U+00ED>r<U+00F3>k <U+00E9>lete <U+00E9>s munk<U+00E1>i], Arcanum, Budapest, 2000, ISBN 9638602996</ref>
