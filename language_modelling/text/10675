==History==
===Formation and signing to Interscope Records (2004&ndash;2007)===
Black Tide was founded in  [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]] in 2004 under the name "Radio" by guitarist Gabriel Garcia and his older brother Raul Garcia. Raul recruited second guitarist Alex Nu<U+00F1>ez, then later bassist Zachary Sandler.  At the time, Gabriel Garcia was 11 years old and Nu<U+00F1>ez was just 13 years old.<ref name="Revolver">{{cite journal| year=2008 |month=March |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Magazine]] |title=Youth Gone Wild |author=Bienstock, Richard |accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref> Garcia, Nu<U+00F1>ez, and Sandler recruited drummer Steven Spence, after Raul's departure from the group.<ref name="Revolver"/> This completed the band's lineup. The band started playing local shows, eventually gaining the attention of record labels due to the members' young age and talent. Winder Marin, the former drummer was dropped and a replacement was brought in to keep the young image of the band. In 2005, Black Tide signed a demo deal with [[Atlantic Records]] <ref name="Revolver"/> as Radio. The deal lasted for only a year, before the band was spotted by a record executive for [[EMI]], who notified [[Interscope Records]] of the band. By mid 2007, now named Black Tide, they were signed to [[Interscope]].<ref name="Revolver"/> They're influenced by classic metal acts such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[AC/DC]] and [[Pantera]].

===''Light from Above'' (2007&ndash;2009)===
The band started touring and gained a position on the second stage of [[Ozzfest]], but were kicked off the tour because the stage was sponsored by [[J<U+00E4>germeister]] and all of the members of Black Tide were under the [[legal drinking age]].<ref name="Ozzfest"/> Although the band was no longer appearing on the second stage, Black Tide was able to be the opening act on the main stage in some areas, opening for [[Lordi]], [[Static-X]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref name="Ozzfest">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=79866 |title=Black Tide members talk about playing this year's Ozzfest |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> After [[Ozzfest]], the band toured with [[Avenged Sevenfold]] and [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=82677 |title=Black Tide preparing for Avenged Sevenfold tour |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=89509 |title=Black Tide added to All That Remains tour |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> They are well known partly due to their age. They are all under the age of 21, two members are still in high school, and the lead singer is still 17.

In early 2007, half a year before playing Ozzfest, Black Tide entered the studio in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] with producer [[Johnny K]]. The band recorded 12 new tracks which included a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Metallica]]'s first written song, "Hit the Lights", which originally appeared on ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=84867 |title=Black Tide: "Shockwave" EP now available |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}</ref> The resulting album, ''[[Light from Above]]'', was released on March 18, 2008. The album was critically praised, with Dan Epstein of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Magazine]]'' saying "Listening to the debut album from Miami's Black Tide is a little like stumbling across a cool late-80s metal record you'd completely forgotten about. A very promising debut" and Scott Alisoglu of [[Blabbermouth.net]] stating the album contains "Big, sometimes pop-based, melodies meets crunchy, guitar-driven metal that falls somewhere between thrash/traditional metal and the dirtier end of '80s glam/hair metal."<ref>{{cite journal| author=Epstein, Dan |year=2008 |month=May |title=Reviews <U+2013> Black Tide ''Light from Above'' |journal=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Magazine]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Alisoglu, Scott |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1376 |title=CD reviews <U+2013> ''Light from Above'' |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> ''Light from Above'' debuted at number 73 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 11,400 copies sold in its first week of sales.<ref name="Chart debut">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=93651 |title=Black Tide debuts on Billboard chart |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Black Tide has also won the [[Kerrang!]] Award for Best Newcomer.
