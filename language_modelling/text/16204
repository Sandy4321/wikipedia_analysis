{{History of Hong Kong}}

In 1840 the [[British Empire]] launched their first and one of the most aggressive expeditionary forces to claim the territory that would later be known as Hong Kong.<ref name="Wiltshireone">Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished & reduced 2003). Old Hong Kong <U+2013> Volume One. Central, Hong Kong: Text Form Asia books Ltd. ISBN Volume One 962-7283-59-2</ref> In a few decades, Hong Kong was transformed from rocky, undeveloped mountains to a major [[entrepot]] for global trade. After invading the territory in 1841 during the [[First Opium War|Opium War]], the British gained land in a series of treaties, turning the colony over to the PRC in 1997. Early social and economic problems existed in the colony, as there were drastic differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and culture. Nonetheless, Hong Kong seized the opportunity to become one of the first parts of East Asia to industrialise and modernise.

===Beginning of trade===
[[File:HKStreets1865.jpg|thumb|Streets of Hong Kong, 1865]]
China was the main supplier of tea to the British, who were domestically consuming {{convert|13600|t|lb}} <ref name="books.google.com">http://books.google.com/books?id=zLY9AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA770&lpg=PA770&dq=1830+%22tea+consumed+Hong+Kong%22&source=bl&ots=jZjQj3qITY&sig=X4_ZVNAsYsusANHQ9CEBwQ6iyBQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SZchT6DsEoTG0QGl5pXyCA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1830%20%22tea%20consumed%20Hong%20Kong%22&f=false</ref> of [[Chinese tea]] by 1830, averaging {{convert|600|g|lb}} of leaves for every citizen.<ref name="books.google.com"/> From the British economic standpoint, Chinese tea was a crucial item since it provided massive wealth for the [[Tai-Pan|taipans]] (foreign, e.g. British, businessmen in China), and the [[Duty (economics)|duty]] on tea accounted for 10% of the government's income.<ref name="Wiltshireone" />

The British diplomats were never in favour of performing [[kowtow]] to the [[Emperor of China]].<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> Many saw it as a religious pursuit and would rather be treated as equal, though the members of the [[Qing Dynasty]] thrones and courts saw the British envoys as uncivilised foreigners strictly here for tea, silk and other far east goods. At the time, China's social structure, as passed down from [[Confucius|Confucian]] philosophy, ranked merchants relatively low (below farmers and above slaves) since they were considered citizens who only enriched themselves.<ref name="Wiltshireone" />

Some of the earliest items sold to China in exchange for tea were British clocks, watches and musical boxes. These were not enough to compensate for the trade imbalance of massive quantities of tea. China developed a strong demand for silver. After the [[Battle of Plassey|1757 territorial conquest]] of [[Bengal]] in India, the British had access to [[opium]], which was used in western society as a tincture added to water for purification.  The Chinese, on the other hand, smoked opium in an addictive narcotic manner. A large fiscal deficit existed in Bengal and so opium export was used by the government to raise tax, though it would come at the price of creating more [[drug addiction]]. [[Lin Zexu]] was the Chinese commissioner who wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839 taking a stance against the acceptance of opium in trade. He confiscated more than 20,000 chests of opium already at the port and supervised their destruction.<ref>Chaos umd.edu. "[http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/modern.html#opium Chaos umd.edu]."

===Confrontation===
[[File:Hkcolonyprocess-EN.png|thumb|left|200px|Great Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and leased the [[New Territories]] rent-free<ref name="Lease">http://www.hkjournal.org/timeline/timeline1800s.html</ref> in 1898.]]

The Queen saw the destruction of British products as an insult and sent the first expeditionary force to defend Britain's "ancient rights of commerce".<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> The [[First Opium War]] (1839<U+2013>1842) began at the hands of Captain [[Charles Elliot]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and Capt. [[Anthony Blaxland Stransham]] of the [[Royal Marines]]. After a series of Chinese defeats, [[Hong Kong Island]] was occupied by the British on 20 January 1841. Sir [[Edward Belcher]], aboard [[HMS Sulphur (1826)|HMS ''Sulphur'']], landed in Hong Kong on 25 January 1841.<ref name=lubbock/> [[Possession Street]] still exists to mark the event, although its Chinese name is <U+6C34><U+5751><U+53E3><U+8857> ("Mouth of the ditch Street").<ref name=lubbock/>  Commodore Sir [[Gordon Bremer]] raised the [[Union Jack]] and claimed Hong Kong as a colony on 26 January 1841.<ref name=lubbock>[http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/041197/base.htm Base closure to end Royal Navy's Far East presence], [[Associated Press]], 4 November 1997</ref> He erected naval store sheds there in April 1841.<ref name="quote melson">Eric Cavaliero, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=41861&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=19971113&sear_year=1997 Harbour bed holds memories], [[The Standard]], 13 November 1997, quoting P J Melson: ''White Ensign <U+2013> Red Dragon: the History of the Royal Navy in Hong Kong 1841 to 1997''</ref>

The island was first used by the British as a staging post during the war, and while the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] intended to establish a permanent base on the island of [[Zhoushan]], Elliot took it upon himself to claim the island on a permanent basis. The ostensible authority for the occupation was negotiated between Captain Eliot and the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]], the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] official [[Qishan (Manchu official)|Qishan]]. The [[Convention of Chuenpee]] was concluded but had not been recognised by the Qing Dynasty court at Beijing. Subsequently, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain in 1842 under the [[Treaty of Nanking]], when the territory became a [[Crown colony]].<ref name="USSD">{{Cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2747.htm|title=Background Note: Hong Kong|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=October 11, 2011|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

The Opium War was ostensibly fought to liberalise trade with China. With a base in Hong Kong, British traders, opium dealers, and merchants including [[History of Jardine, Matheson & Co.|Jardine Matheson & Co.]] and [[Dent & Co.]] launched the city which would become the 'free trade' nexus of the East. American opium traders and merchant bankers such as the Russell, [[John Perkins Cushing|Perkins]] and [[Forbes family|Forbes]] families would soon join the trade. Britain was granted a rent-free perpetual lease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860 [[Convention of Beijing]], which formally ended hostilities in the [[Second Opium War]] (1856<U+2013>1858).{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}

In 1898, the United Kingdom became concerned that Hong Kong could not be defended unless surrounding areas were also under British control. As a result, a 99-year rent-free<ref name="Lease" /> lease titled the [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory|Second Convention of Peking]] was drafted and executed, significantly expanding the size of Hong Kong via the addition of the New Territories. The lease would expire at midnight on 30&nbsp;June 1997.<ref name="USSD" />

==Demographics==

{{further|Demographics of Hong Kong}}

===Population===
When the [[union flag]] was raised over [[Possession Point]] on 26 January 1841, the population of Hong Kong island was about 7,450, mostly [[Tanka (ethnic group)|Tanka]] fishermen and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[Charcoal maker|charcoal burners]] living in a number of coastal villages.<ref name=thomson>John Thomson 1837<U+2013>1921, [http://irc.aa.tufs.ac.jp/thomson/vol_1/mother/102.html Chap on Hong Kong], Illustrations of China and Its People (London,1873<U+2013>1874)</ref><ref>Info Gov HK. "[http://www.info.gov.hk/police/hkp-text/english/history/history_01.htm Hong Kong Gov Info]." ''History of Hong Kong.'' Retrieved on 16 February 2007.</ref> In the 1850s large numbers of Chinese would emigrate from China to Hong Kong due to the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Other events such as floods, typhoons and famine in [[mainland China]] would also play a role in establishing Hong Kong as a place to escape the mayhem.

According to the census of 1865, Hong Kong had a population of 125,504, of which some 2,000 were Americans and Europeans.<ref name=thomson/> In 1914 despite an exodus of 60,000 Chinese fearing an attack on the colony during World War I, Hong Kong's population continued to increase from 530,000 in 1916 to 725,000 in 1925 and 1.6 million by 1941.<ref name="Stanford">Stanford, David. [2006] (2006). Roses in December. Lulu press. ISBN 1-84753-966-1</ref>

===Segregation===
The establishment of the [[free port]] made Hong Kong a major [[entrep<U+00F4>t]] from the start, attracting [[Hong Kongers|people]] from China and Europe alike. The society remained [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and polarised due to British colonial policies and attitudes.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /><ref>''Race War!: White Supremacy and the Japanese Attack on the British Empire'' by [[Gerald Horne]], New York University Press, 2003</ref> Despite the rise of a British-educated Chinese upper class by the late 19th century, race laws such as the [[Peak Reservation Ordinance]] prevented Chinese from living in elite areas like [[Victoria Peak]].<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> Politically, the majority Chinese population also had little to no official governmental influence throughout much of the early years. There were, however, a small number of Chinese elites that the British governors relied on, including [[Kai Ho|Sir Kai Ho]] and [[Robert Hotung]].<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> They accepted their place in the Hong Kong hierarchy, and served as main communicators and mediators between the government and the Chinese population. Sir Kai Ho was an unofficial member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. Robert Hotung wanted Chinese citizens to recognise Hong Kong as the new home after the fall of China's [[Qing dynasty|last dynasty]] in 1911. As a millionaire with financial influence, he emphasised that no part of the demographics was purely [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]].<ref>Carroll, John Mark. Edge of Empires:Chinese Elites and British Colonials in Hong Kong. Harvard university press. ISBN 0-674-01701-3</ref>

==Culture==
{{Further|Culture of Hong Kong}}

===Lifestyle===
[[File:Chinese rice congee.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Congee]], a popular colonial era breakfast]]
The east portion of Colonial Hong Kong was mostly dedicated to the British; filled with race courses, parade grounds, barracks, [[cricket]] and [[polo]] fields. The west portion was filled with Chinese shops, crowded markets and [[tea house]]s. The [[Hong Kong tea culture]] began in this period and evolved into [[yum cha]]. One of the most common breakfasts was [[congee]] with fish and [[barley]].

In the mid-19th century many of the merchants would sell silk, [[jade]] and consult [[feng shui]] to open shops that favour better spiritual arrangements.<ref name="Lim">Lim, Patricia. [2002] (2002). Discovering Hong Hong's Cultural Heritage. Central, Hong Kong: Oxford University Press. ISBN Volume One 0-19-592723-0</ref> Other lower ranked groups like [[coolies]] arrived with the notion that hard work would better position them for the future. And the success of boatmen, merchants, carters and fishermen in Hong Kong, would leapfrog China's most popular port in [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. By 1880 Hong Kong's port would handle 27% of the mainland's export and 37% of imports.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> 

A British traveller, [[Isabella Bird]], described Hong Kong in the 1870s as a colony filled with comforts and entertainment only a Victorian society would be able to enjoy. Other descriptions mentioned courts, hotels, post offices, shops, city hall complexes, museums, libraries and structures in impressive manner for the era.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> Many European businessmen went to Hong Kong to do business. They were referred to as [[Tai-Pan|tai-pans]] or "bigshot". One of the more notable Tai-pan hangout spot was the [[Hong Kong Club]] at [[Queen's Road, Hong Kong|Queen's Road]].<ref name="Wiltshireone" />

===Education===

{{Further|Education in Hong Kong}}

In 1861, [[Frederick Stewart (colonial administrator)|Frederick Stewart]] would become the founder of Hong Kong education system bringing western-style philosophy to the east. Some have argued that his contribution is the key turning point between the group of Chinese that were able to modernise Hong Kong versus the group that did not in China. The education would bring western-style finance, science, history, technology into the culture. The father of modern China, [[Sun Yat-sen]] was also educated in Hong Kong's [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Central School]].<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" />

===Law and order===
{{Further|Law enforcement in Hong Kong}}

In 1843 the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]] was established. The [[governor of Hong Kong]] generally served as the British [[plenipotentiary]] in the far east in the early years. The [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Colonial Secretary]] would also assist in legal matters.

A colonial police force was established in the 1840s to handle the high crime rate in Hong Kong. By China's standards, colonial Hong Kong's code of punishment was considered laughably loose and lenient.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> The lack of intimidation may have been the leading cause for the continual rise in crime.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> [[Po Leung Kuk]] became one of the first organisations established to deal with the [[Kidnapping|abduction]] of women and prostitution crisis. Crime at sea was also common as some pirates had access to [[cutlass]]es and [[revolver]]s.<ref name="Wiltshireone" />

===Pandemics and disasters===
The [[Third plague pandemic|Third Pandemic]] of [[bubonic plague]] broke out in China in the 1880s. By the spring of 1894 about 100,000 were reported dead in the mainland. In May 1894 the disease erupted into Hong Kong's overcrowded Chinese quarter of [[Tai Ping Shan Street|Tai Ping Shan]]. By the end of the month, an estimated 450 people died of the illness.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /> At its height, the epidemic was killing 100 people per day, and it killed a total of 2,552 people that year. The disease was greatly detrimental to trade and produced a temporary exodus of 100,000 Chinese from the colony. Plague continued to be a problem in the territory for the next 30 years. In the 1870s a [[typhoon]] hit Hong Kong one evening reaching its height by midnight. An estimated 2,000 people lost their lives in a span of just six hours.<ref name="Wiltshireone" /><ref name="Stanford" />

==Economy==
[[File:HKCar1900s.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First generation of automobiles in Hong Kong]]

===Transport===
{{main|Transport in Hong Kong}}
The growth of Hong Kong depended greatly on domestic transport of citizens and cargo across [[Victoria Harbour]]. The establishment of the [[Star Ferry]] and the [[Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry|Yaumati Ferry]] would prove to be vital. In 1843 the colony had built the first ship at a private shipyard. Some of the customers later included the Spanish government in the Philippines and the [[Imperial Chinese Navy|Chinese navy]]. The [[Peak Tram]] would begin in 1888 along with the [[Hong Kong Tramways|Tramway]] service in 1904. The first railway line was also launched in 1910 as the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]]. 

On land the [[rickshaws]] were extremely popular when they were first imported from Japan in 1874, since it was affordable and necessary for street merchants to haul goods. [[Sedan chair]]s were the preferred mode of the transport for the wealthy Europeans who lived on [[Victoria Peak]] due to the steep grade which ruled out rickshaws until the introduction of the Peak Tram.  The first automobiles in Hong Kong had petrol-driven internal combustion engines and arrived between 1903<U+2013>05.  Initially they were not well received by the public. Only around 1910 did the cars begin to gain appeal. Most of the owners were British.<ref>Bard, Solomon. [2002] (2002) Voices from the Past: Hong Kong 1842<U+2013>1918. Hong Kong:HK University Press. ISBN 962-209-574-7</ref> Buses operated by various independent companies flourished in the 1920s until the government formally issued franchises for the [[China Motor Bus]] and [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] companies in 1933.

The [[flying boats]] were the first British aeroplanes to reach Hong Kong in 1928. By 1924 the [[Kai Tak Airport]] would also be found. The first flight service from [[Imperial Airways]] would become available by 1937 at a price of 288 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] per ticket.<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" />

===Hospitals and hospitality===
{{main|Health in Hong Kong}}

Soon after the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841, Protestant and Catholic missionaries started to provide social service. Italian missionaries began to provide boy-only education to British and Chinese youth in 1843. "The Catholic French Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres" was one of the first orphanage and elderly home was established in 1848.<ref>Bray, Mark. Koo, Ramsey.

In 1870 the [[Tung Wah Hospital]] became the first official hospital in Hong Kong. It handled much of the social services and was providing free [[vaccination]]s in Hong Kong Island and [[Guangdong|Kwang Tung]]. After raising funds for the 1877 [[List of famines|famine in China]], a number of the hospital officials became Tung Wah elites with much authority and power representing the Chinese majority.<ref>Tsai, Jung-fang.

===Finance===
{{further|Hong Kong Monetary Authority}}

In 1864 the first large scale modern bank [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong Shanghai Bank]] would be established turning Hong Kong into the focal point of financial affairs in Asia. Its chief manager, [[Sir Thomas Jackson Bart|Sir Thomas Jackson]], has a statue in [[Statue Square]]. The bank first leased Wardley House at HKD 500 a month in 1864. After raising a capital of HKD 5 million, the bank opened its door in 1865.<ref name="Lim" /> The [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Association of Stockbrokers]] would also be established in 1891.

In December 1890 the [[Hongkong Electric]] company went into production with help from [[Catchick Paul Chater]]. It was the first step in allowing the transition of [[gas lamps]] to [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulbs]].<ref>Coates, Austin. [1977] (1977).

[[File:HK dockyard 1894.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Naval Dockyard buildings (centre), [[Queen's Road, Hong Kong|Queen's Road]], 1894]]

{{Main|Politics of Hong Kong}}

One observer summed up the decades as "politics, propaganda, panic, rumour, riot, revolution and refugees".<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> The role of Hong Kong as a political safe haven for Chinese [[political refugees]] further cemented its status, and few serious attempts to revert its ownership were launched in the early 20th century. Both [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]] and [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] agitators found refuge in the territory, when they did not actively participate in the turmoil in China. However, the dockworkers strikes in the 1920s and 1930s were widely attributed to the Communists by the authorities, and caused a backlash against them. A strike in 1920 was ended with a wage increase of [[Hong Kong Dollar|HKD]] 32 cents.<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> 

[[Ambrose King]], in his controversial 1975 paper ''Administrative Absorption of Politics in Hong Kong'', described the colonial Hong Kong's administration as "elite consensual government".{{cn|date=June 2013}} In it, he claimed, any coalition of elites or forces capable of challenging the legitimacy of Hong Kong's administrative structure would be co-opted by the existing apparatus through the appointment of leading political activists, business figures and other elites to oversight committees, by granting them British honours, and by bringing them into elite institutions like Hong Kong's horse racing clubs. He called this "[[synarchy]]", an extension of [[John K. Fairbank]]'s use of the word to describe the mechanisms of government under the late [[Qing dynasty]] in China.

When modern China began after the fall of the last dynasty, one of the first political statements made in Hong Kong was the immediate change from [[Queue (hairstyle)|long queue hairstyles]] to short haircuts.<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> In 1938, Guangzhou fell to the hands of the Japanese, Hong Kong was considered a strategic military outpost for all trades in the far east.  Though [[Winston Churchill]] assured that Hong Kong was an "impregnable fortress",<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" /> it was taken as a reality check response since the [[British Army]] actually stretched too thin to battle on two fronts.<ref name="Wiltshiretwo" />
