The [[C<U+00F3>ras Iompair <U+00C9>ireann]] '''401 Class''' [[locomotive]]s were built in 1957-1958 and designed for use on branch line traffic and shunting. They were fitted with a Maybach MD220 engine of 420 hp, with diesel hydraulic transmission via a Mekydro KL64 torque converter, and were of C [[UIC classification|wheel arrangement]].

Though they had a design maximum speed of 100 km/h (60 mph), experience showed that they did not ride well when travelling at speeds over 40km/h (25 mph) and so henceforth were limited to that speed. They were numbered E401-E419, and were withdrawn from service between 1968 and 1977.

== Model ==
The 401 was available as a resin model from "Q Kits" [http://website.lineone.net/~sjohnson40/Loco%20Profiles/EClass.html], but this company is no longer trading as the owner has retired.
