'''''Remixed & Revisited''''' is a [[remix album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. It was released on November 24, 2003 by [[Maverick Records]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The album contains four songs, in remixed form, from her 2003 ninth studio album ''[[American Life]]'' and a previously unreleased song, "Your Honesty," originally written for her 1994 sixth studio album ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]''. The other tracks included are the live performance of "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]" and "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]" on the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]<U+2014>which ended with Madonna kissing co-performers [[Britney Spears]] and [[Christina Aguilera]]<U+2014>and a remix of 1985 single "[[Into the Groove]]". The release peaked at number 115 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States. It received mixed reviews from critics; "Your Honesty" was generally the only song to receive praise. The remix album also marked the closing release under her contract with [[Maverick Records]].

[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] felt that the presence of a "strong hook and a strong sense of fun" was missing from the compilation, except for the song "Your Honesty", which he declared as the best track despite feeling its beats to be a little outdated. He compared the work of the remixers as "as subtle as a jackhammer, whether it's on the metallic-flaked "American Life" by Headcleanr or the '90s-retro Nevins mix of "Nothing Fails". On all these mixes, Madonna sounds as if she's out of step with the music of 2003". Erlewine also compared Spears' vocals with that of Madonna's during her early days and Aguilera's with that of [[Cher]]'s.<ref name="allmusic"/> Nathan Brackett of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that the release "improves upon ''American Life''{{'}}s standout single "Love Profusion", but the rest botches an opportunity to revive interest on its parent album".<ref name="rs">{{cite book|authorlink=Nathan Brackett| last=Brackett| first=Nathan| coauthors=Hoard, Christian|year=2004|title=The new Rolling Stone album guide|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lRgtYCC6OUwC&pg=PA508&dq=madonna+remixed+%26+revisited#v=onepage&q=|accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref> Fabian from ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' commented that ''Remixed & Revisited'' "is an amusing collection of novelties."<ref name="dailybreeze">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-15699243.html|title='Remixed' Madonna gets in the groove |author=Fabian|date=December 12, 2003|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=October 1, 2009}}</ref> Sarah Crompton from ''[[Boston Herald]]'' proclaimed the album to be "more fun than her full-length 2003 offering ''American Life.''"<ref name="bh">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BNHB&p_theme=bnhb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_field_fselect-0=&p_text_fselect-0=Madonna%20Remixed%20Revisited&s_dispstring=all(Madonna%20Remixed%20Revisited)%20AND%20date(01/01/1970%20to%2002/04/2013)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=01/01/1970%20to%2002/04/2013)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|title=Madonna `Revisited' energizes Material Girl's `Life' tracks|last=Crompton|first=Sarah|date=December 7, 2003|work=[[Boston Herald]]|publisher=Herald Media, Inc|accessdate=October 1, 2009}} </ref> ''[[The Malay Mail]]'' said that the remixes from the album are for "true blue Madonna fans."<ref name="mm">{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-19975313_ITM|title=Remixes for true blue Madonna fans|date=January 13, 2004|work=[[The Malay Mail]]|author=Jerryz|publisher=[[Media Prima]]|accessdate=October 1, 2009}} </ref>
