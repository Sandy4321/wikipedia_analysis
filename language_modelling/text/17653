'''Cunipert''' (also '''Cunibert''' or '''Cunincpert''') was king of the [[Lombards]] from 688 to 700.  He succeeded his father [[Perctarit]], though he was associated with the throne from 678.  

He warred with the [[Arianism|Arian]] rebel [[Alagis]], [[duke]] of [[Trento|Trent]] and [[Brescia]], who had fought his father and rebelled again in 688 after Perctarit died.  He forced Cunipert to a castle on an island in the middle of [[Lake Como]], but his rule was burdensome and tyrannical, and so he lost the support of the people.  Finally, in 689, Cunipter issued forth with the men of [[Piedmont]] and defeated Alahis and the men of [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] at [[Battle of Coronate|Coronate]], on the Horn of the [[Adda River|Adda]], near [[Lodi, Italy|Lodi]].  Alahis was vanquished and slain in battle.  

Cunipert fought many more insurrections during his reign, including that of [[Ausfrid]], usurper duke of [[Friuli]], whom he successfully subjected to his authority.  

He also successfully fixed the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] church between [[Aquileia]] and [[Grado, Italy|Grado]].  

He died in 700 and was succeeded by his young son [[Liutpert]], the [[regent]] [[Ansprand]], and many rebels.  Many wars took place during his reign. He is notably the first Lombard monarch to strike coins in his image.  <ref>{{cite web
