"'''Get Me Bodied'''" is a song by American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. The song was written by Knowles, [[Sean Garrett]], [[Solange Knowles]], Angela Beyince, Makeba Riddick, and [[Swizz Beatz|Kasseem "Swizz Beatz" Dean]]. The track was produced by Swizz Beatz, Beyonc<U+00E9> and Sean Garrett, for Beyonc<U+00E9>'s second solo studio album, ''[[B'Day]]''. She took inspiration from her sister (singer [[Solange]]) and former [[Destiny's Child]] band-mates [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] during the writing process.

The single was released as the album's seventh and final single for the United States on July 10, 2007. "Get Me Bodied" reached number sixty-eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], becoming the album's lowest charting U.S.-released single. The song was positively received by contemporary critics. "Get Me Bodied" was nominated by VH1 Soul VIBE Awards Special for Video of the Year. The single's accompanying [[music video]] features visual elements and choreography inspired by [[The Frug]] from [[Bob Fosse]]'s film adaptation of the Broadway [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Sweet Charity]]''; the video features Solange, Rowland and Williams.

== Background ==
During a vacation after six months of filming ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', Beyonc<U+00E9> went to the studio to begin working on her second solo album ''B'Day''.<ref name="Reid2">{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Be All You Can, B. |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_081406/index2.jhtml |work=MTV News |publisher=MTV Networks |date= |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> Beyonc<U+00E9> revealed: "[When filming ended,] I had so many things bottled up, so many emotions, so many ideas".<ref name="Reid2"/> She contacted American songwriter-[[record producer|producer]] [[Sean Garrett]], who co-wrote her 2005 hit single "Check on It", and booked him at the [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="Conniff">{{Cite news |last=Conniff |first=Tamara |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> Builds Buzz For 'B-Day' |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002689847 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |date=(June 16, 2006) |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref> She also called American hip hop producer-rapper Kasseem "Swizz Beatz" Dean who had co-produced songs for her before. Besides her sister-singer [[Solange Knowles]], Beyonc<U+00E9> enlisted her cousin Angela Beyince, who had been collaborated on her previous album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'', and up-and-coming songwriter Makeba Riddick, who became part of the ''B'Day'' production team after co-writing the album's lead single "[[D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu]]".<ref name="Reid2"/>

Beyonc<U+00E9> took inspiration from Solange, who helped her writing the song, and former [[Destiny's Child]] band-mates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. In the song, she mentioned "three best friends" because she was thinking of them while writing.<ref name="Vineyard"/>

While working on the lyrics, Swizz Beatz and other producers in the team produced the track. "Get Me Bodied" was produced by Swizz Beatz, Beyonc<U+00E9> and Sean Garrett. It is one of the four songs produced by Swizz Beatz for the album, including "Upgrade U" and "Ring the Alarm", which was produced by the same trio.<ref name="Reid2"/> The song was recorded in the same studio.

== Music and structure ==
"Get Me Bodied" is a moderate [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Bounce music|bounce]] track.<ref name="MusicSheet">{{Cite web |last= |first= |title= Beyonc<U+00E9> Digital Sheet Music: Get Me Bodied |url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0034389 |work=Musicnotes |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |date= |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref><ref name="Davis">{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Carolyn E. |title=B-Day: Beyonc<U+00E9><U+2019>s back and branching out with a more mature sound |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/node/560 |work=US Magazine |publisher=Us Weekly |date=September 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref><ref name="Serwer">{{Cite web |last= Serwer|first= Jesse|title= What is it?

The lyrics are constructed in the traditional [[verse-chorus form]]. Beyonc<U+00E9> mentions the date of her birthday to 9-4-8-1. A man's voice takes over singing "hey's" and "jump's" for four [[bar (music)|bar]], followed with the first verse. The verses are written like a list where Beyonc<U+00E9> roll calls her missions before going party. It is followed with the chorus, then the second verse. The chorus repeats giving way to the [[bridge (music)|bridge]]. Beyonc<U+00E9> sings the chorus again, ending the song with "hey!".

== Release and reception ==
"Get Me Bodied" and "[[Green Light (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Green Light]]" were planned to be released as the next two singles from ''[[B'day]]'', following the lead single "[[D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu]]". Beyonc<U+00E9> aimed the tracks at the international markets; but opted for "[[Ring the Alarm]]" as the second single, which charted poorly.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Concepcion |first=Mariel |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> Rings The Alarm on Vibe.com |url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/08/beyonce_rings_the_alarm_on_vibe_com/ |work=VIBE |publisher=Vibe Media Group, Inc. |date=(August 16, 2006) |accessdate=2008-02-04}}</ref> Instead, "Get Me Bodied" was released after the album's deluxe edition's "[[Beautiful Liar]]" (2007).

"Get Me Bodied" received plaudits from the public. Chris Richards of The ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to the track a "club-hungry come-ons" with a "dexterous melody". He further stated that the "skeletal" track "keeps Beyonc<U+00E9> tethered to the ground".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Richards |first=Chris |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s 'B'Day' Is Nothing to Celebrate |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/05/AR2006090501475.html |work=The Washington Post Company |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=September 6, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Jody Rosen of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented that "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of "Get Me Bodied," which sets Beyonc<U+00E9>'s harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jody |title=B'Day (2006): Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1516025,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. |date=September 1, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Tim Finney of [[Pitchfork Media]] called the track a "percussive, Diwali-esque jam".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Finney |first=Tim |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: B'Day |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38328-bday |work=Pitchfork Media |publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc. |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> ''[[US Weekly]]'' described "Get Me Bodied" a "snappy dance number"<ref name="Davis"/> and Bill Lamb of About.com called it a "party track".<ref name="Lamb">{{Cite web |last=Lamb |first=Bill |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> - B'Day: Beyonc<U+00E9> Steps Several Steps Forward on Her B'Day |url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/beyoncebday.htm |work=About |publisher=About, Inc. |date= |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> Spence D. of [[IGN]] complimented Swizz Beatz for "toss[ing] up a strange click track rhythm that is augmented by 'ayes' and 'yos.'"

Beyonc<U+00E9> said that it "sets the tone of the video".<ref name="Vineyard"/>

Beyonc<U+00E9>'s mother and stylist, [[Tina Knowles]] created over sixty outfits for Beyonc<U+00E9> and the fifty extras featured in the video.<ref name="Jennifer"/> The "instructional" dance-oriented video is inspired by the '60s choreographies. Beyonc<U+00E9> cites influences from the legendary [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] director-choreographer [[Bob Fosse]], Southern and Jamaican movement and the [[The Frug|Frug]] from the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Sweet Charity]]''. She said, "It tells you how to do all the dances <U+2014> it's modern, it's retro, it's vintage, it's stylized, it's all of those things put together."<ref name="Vineyard"/> The story moves from a tony party reminiscent of the [[Jazz Age]], followed with dance sequences.

A re-edit of the video was produced for the [[Timbaland]] remix featuring [[Voltio]]. Although Voltio does not actually appear in the video, unused footages of the original video were replaced during his parts, instead. The re-edited video was posted on the [[MTV Overdrive]] on July 26, 2007 and is available on iTunes. The video is also included on the DVD for [[Irreemplazable]].
