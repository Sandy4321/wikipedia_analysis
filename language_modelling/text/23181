King '''Otto of Greece''', (Greek: '''<U+038C><U+03B8><U+03C9><U+03BD>, <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2>''', ''Othon, Vasileus tis Ellados'') ''also'' Prince of Bavaria ([[June 1]], [[1815]] - [[July 26]], [[1867]]) was made the first modern king of [[First Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] in [[1832]] under the [[London Conference of 1832|Convention of London]], whereby Greece became a new independent [[monarchy|kingdom]] under the protection of the [[Great Powers]] ([[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[July Monarchy|France]] and the [[Russian Empire]]). 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]], as second son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|King Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and [[Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen]]. Through his ancestor the Bavarian Duke [[John II, Duke of Bavaria|John II]], Otto was a descendant of the Greek [[Byzantine Emperor|imperial dynasties]] of [[Comnenus]] and [[Lascaris]].

==Early reign==
When he was elected king, the Great Powers extracted a pledge from Otto's father to restrain him from hostile actions against the [[Ottoman Empire]], and insisted on his title being that of "King of Greece" instead of "King of the Greeks", which would imply a claim over the millions of Greeks then still under Turkish rule. Not quite 18, the young prince arrived in [[Greece]] with 3,500 Bavarian troops and three Bavarian advisors aboard the British [[frigate]] ''[[HMS Madagascar (1822)|HMS Madagascar]]''.

The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Rothschilds|Rothschild]] bank, who were underwriting the Greek loans, insisted on financial stringency on Armansperg. The Greeks were soon more heavily taxed than under [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] rule; they had exchanged a hated [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[tyranny]], which they understood, for government by a foreign [[bureaucracy]], the "Bavarocracy" (<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03AF><U+03B1>), which they despised. In addition, Otto showed little respect for local customs. As a staunch [[Catholic]], and thus considered a [[heresy|heretic]] among the Greeks, he never changed his religion since he was guaranteed, under the constitutional provisions as the first [[monarch|King]] of a new Greek [[dynasty]], that he could remain a Catholic. His [[heir]]s however would have to be [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] according to the terms of the 1843 Constitution.  <sup>[[#Notes and references|1]]</sup>   

[[Image:Peter von Hess 005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Otto of Greece entering [[N<U+00E1>fplio]], [[Peter von Hess]], 1835.]]

King Otto's early reign was notable for the establishment of schools and hospitals including the [[National Technical University of Athens|Athens Polytechnic University]].

In 1837, Otto visited [[Germany]] and married the beautiful and talented [[Amalia of Oldenburg|Duchess Amelie of Oldenburg ]] ([[December 21]], [[1818]] - [[May 20]], [[1875]]). The wedding took place not in Greece, but in [[Oldenburg]], on [[November 22]], [[1836]]; the marriage did not produce an heir and the new queen made herself unpopular by interfering in the government. Not entirely faithful to his wife, he like his father had a liason with [[Jane Digby]].

Meanwhile, due to his overtly undermining the king, Armansperg was dismissed as Prime Minister by King Otto immediately on his return.  However, despite high hopes by the Greeks, the Bavarian [[Ignaz von Rundhart|Rundhart]] was appointed chief minister and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment by efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of [[Crete]] in 1841, failed in their objective and only succeeded in embroiling him with the Great Powers.

==Parties, finances and the church==
Throughout his reign, King Otto found himself confronted by a recurring series of issues: partisanship of the Greeks, financial uncertainty, and ecclesiastical issues.  

Greek parties in the Othonian era were based on two factors: the political activities of the diplomatic representatives of the [[Great Powers]]: [[Russia]], [[England]] and [[France]] and the affiliation of Greek political figures with these diplomats.

{{Main|Early Greek Parties}}
 
The affiliations of some of the most well-known Greeks that era include: 

*''[[Russian Party (Greece)|Russian Party]]'' (also called the Napist party): [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], [[Constantine Kanaris]], [[Kitsos Tzavelas]], [[Andreas Metaxas]]; 

*''[[French Party (Greece)|French Party]]'': [[Ioannis Kolettis]], [[Ioannis Makriyannis]], [[Dimitrios Voulgaris]], [[Nikolaos Krieziotes]];

*''[[English Party (Greece)|English Party]]'': [[Prince Alexander Mavrocordatos|Alexander Mavrocordatos]], [[Kostas Botsaris]], [[Andreas Vokos Miaoulis|Andreas Miaoulis]], [[Spyridon Trikoupis]], [[Andreas Zaimis]].

[[Image:King Otto of Greece.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A romantic portrayal of Otto in front of ancient Greek remains.]]
Financial uncertainty of the Othonian monarchy was the result of 1) Greece's poverty, 2) the concentration of land in the hands of a small number of wealthy "primates" like the [[Petros Mavromichalis|Mavromichalises]] of [[Mani]], and 3) the promise of 60,000,000 francs in loans from the Great Powers, which kept these nations involved in Greek internal affairs and the Crown constantly seeking to please one or the other power to ensure the flow of funds. [[Image:Otto of Hellas.jpg|thumb|right|250px|King Otto depicted in the traditional Greek uniform in an official portrait. His title in the lower place of the gravure is written in two languages: German and Greek.]]

The political machinations of the Great Powers was personified in their three legates in Athens: the French Theobald Piscatory, the Russian Gabriel Catacazy, and the English [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]]. They informed their home governments on the activities of the Greeks, while serving as advisers to their respective allied parties within Greece.

Otto pursued policies, such as balancing power among all the parties and sharing offices among the parties, ostensibly to reduce the power of the parties while trying to bring a pro-Otto party into being. The parties, however, became the entree into government power and financial stability. The effect of his (and his advisors') policies was to make the Great Powers' parties more powerful, not less. The Great Powers did not support curtailing Otto's increasing absolutism, however, which resulted in a near permanent conflict between Otto's absolute monarchy and the power bases of his Greek subjects. <sup>[[#Notes and references|2]]</sup> 

Otto found himself confronted by a number of intractable ecclesiastical issues: monasticism, autocephaly, the king as head of the church and toleration of other churches.  His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, established a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries.  This was very upsetting to the church hierarchy and the Russian Party, which was a stalwart defender of [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]].  Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.  On the issue of [[autocephaly]] and his role as king within the church, Otto was overwhelmed by the arcana of church doctrine and popular discontent with his Catholicism.  In 1833, the regents had unilaterally declared the autocephaly of the [[Church of Greece]].  This recognized the ''de facto'' political situation, as the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] was under the political control of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Conservatives (mostly in the Russian Party), concerned that having a Catholic as the head of the Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church, criticised the unilateral declaration of autocephaly as [[Canon law|non-canonical]]. They likewise resisted the foreign, mostly [[Protestant]], missionaries who established schools throughout Greece for the same reason.  Tolerance of other religions was supported by some in the English Party and others educated in the West as a symbol of Greece's progress as a liberal European state. In the end, power over the church and education was ceded to the Russian Party, while the king maintained a veto over the decision of the [[Synod]] of Bishops. This was to avoid discrediting Greece in the eyes of Western Europe as a backward, religiously intolerant society.

==September 3 revolution and later reign==
Although King Otto tried to function as an absolute monarch, as Thomas Gallant writes, he "was neither ruthless enough to be feared, nor compassionate enough to be loved, nor competent enough to be respected." <sup>[[#Notes and references|3]]</sup> By 1843, public dissatisfaction with him had reached crisis proportions and there were demands for a constitution. Initially Otto refused to grant a [[constitution]], but as soon as [[Germany|German]] troops were withdrawn from the kingdom, a [[military coup]] was launched. On [[September 3]], [[1843]], the infantry led by Colonel [[Dimitri Kalergis|Kallergis]] (<U+039A><U+03B1><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03B7><U+03C2>) and the respected Revolution captain [[Ioannis Makriyannis]] (<U+039C><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03C5><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>) assembled in the Square in front of the Palace in Athens. [[Image:OtonIdeGrecia1865.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Otto exiled in Bavaria two years before his death.]]

Eventually joined by much of the population of the small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent national assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising. Left with little recourse, now that his German troops were gone, King Otto gave in to the pressure and agreed to the demands of the crowd over the objections of his opinionated [[Queen Amalia of Greece|Queen]]. This square was renamed [[Syntagma Square|Constitution Square]] (<U+03A0><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03A3><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03AC><U+03B3><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>) to commemorate the events of September 1843.  <sup>[[#Notes and references|4]]</sup> Now for the first time the king had Greeks in his council and the French party, the English Party or the Russian Party (according to which of the [[Great Powers]]' culture they most esteemed) vied for rank and power. 

The King's prestige, which was based in large part on his support by the combined Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the "[[Pacifico incident]]" of 1850, when British [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] sent the British fleet to blockade the port of [[Piraeus]] with warships, to exact reparation for injustice done to a British subject.

The "[[Great Idea]]" (<U+039C><U+03B5><U+03B3><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B7> <U+0399><U+03B4><U+03AD><U+03B1>), Greece's dream of restoring the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Christian]] rule, led to his contemplating to enter the [[Crimean War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1853; the enterprise was unsuccessful, and resulted in renewed intervention by the Great Powers and a second blockade of [[Piraeus]]. In 1861, a student named Aristeidis Dosios (son of politician [[Konstantinos Dosios]]) <sup>[[#Notes and references|5]]</sup> attempted to murder [[Queen Amalia of Greece|Queen Amalia]], and was openly hailed as a hero. His attempt, however, also prompted spontaneous feelings of monarchism and sympathy towards the royal couple among the Greek population. <sup>[[#Notes and references|5]]</sup>

==Exile and death==
While on a visit to the Peloponnese in 1862, a new coup was launched and this time a [[provisional government]] was set up and summoned a national convention. Ambassadors of the [[Great Powers]] urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to [[Bavaria]] the same way they had come to Greece (''aboard a foreign warship''), taking with them the Greek royal regalia which he had brought from Bavaria in 1832.  It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was a major unresolved question at the time. <sup>[[#Notes and references|6]]</sup> It is also true, however, that the constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.

He died in the palace of the former bishops of [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], and was buried in the [[Theatinerkirche (M<U+00FC>nchen)|Theatiner Church]] in [[Munich]]. During his retirement, he would still wear the traditional uniform nowadays worn only by the [[evzones]]; during the rebellion in [[Crete]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1866, Otto donated most of his fortune to support the [[Cretan]] rebellion by supplying it with [[weapon|arms]]. He also made provisions for his donation to be kept secret until his death, to avoid causing political problems to the new King, [[George I of Greece|George I]].
