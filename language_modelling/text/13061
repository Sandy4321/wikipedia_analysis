The '''British Empire''' comprised the [[dominion]]s, [[Crown colony|colonies]], [[protectorate]]s and [[League of Nations mandate|mandates]] ruled or administered by the [[United Kingdom]] (UK), that had originated with the overseas colonies and [[trading post]]s established by [[England]] in the 17th century. At its height it was the largest [[empire]] in history and, for over a century, was the foremost [[Great power|global power]]. By 1922, the British Empire held sway over a population of about 458 million people, one-quarter of the world's population,<ref>[[#refMaddison2001|Madisson 2001]], pp.&nbsp;98, 242</ref> and covered more than {{mi2 to km2|14000000|precision=-3}}: approximately a quarter of Earth's total land area.<ref>[[#refFerguson2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;15</ref> As a result, its political, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was often said that "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|the sun never sets on the British Empire]]" because its span across the globe ensured that the sun was always shining on at least one of its numerous territories.

During the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] pioneered European exploration of the globe and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires bestowed on Spain and Portugal, England, [[French Colonial Empire|France]] and the [[Dutch Empire|Netherlands]] began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars with the Netherlands and France left England (following the [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]], [[Great Britain|Britain]]) the dominant colonial power in North America and India. However, the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in [[North America]] in 1783 after a [[American War of Independence|war of independence]] was a blow to Britain, depriving it of its most populous colonies. Despite this setback, British attention soon turned towards [[Africa]], Asia and [[Oceania]]. Following the defeat of [[Napoleonic France]] in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of effectively unchallenged dominance, and expanded its imperial holdings across the globe.  Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its [[White people|white]] settler colonies, which were reclassified as dominions.

The growth of [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] eroded Britain's economic lead by the end of the 19th century. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of [[World War I]], for which Britain leaned heavily upon its Empire.  The conflict placed enormous financial strain on Britain, and although the Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after the war, it was no longer a peerless industrial or military power. Despite emerging victorious, [[World War II]] saw Britain's colonies in South-East Asia occupied by [[Japan]], which damaged British prestige and accelerated the decline of the Empire. Within two years of the end of the war, Britain granted independence to its most populous and valuable colony, India.

During the remainder of the 20th century, most of the territories of the Empire became independent as part of a larger global [[decolonisation]] movement by the European powers, ending with the return of [[Hong Kong]] to [[China]] in 1997. After independence, many British colonies joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a free association of independent states. Some have retained the [[British monarch]], currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], as their [[head of state]] to become independent [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Fourteen territories remain under British sovereignty, the [[British overseas territories]].

==Origins (1497<U+2013>1583)==
The foundation for the British Empire was laid at a time before the creation of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], when [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] were separate kingdoms. In 1496 King [[Henry VII of England]], following the successes of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in overseas exploration, commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to discover a route to [[Asia]] via the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]].<ref name="ferguson3">[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;3</ref> Cabot sailed in 1497, and though he successfully made landfall on the coast of [[Canada]] (mistakenly believing, like [[Christopher Columbus]] five years earlier, that he had reached Asia),<ref>[[#refAndrews1985|Andrews 1985]], p.&nbsp;45</ref> there was no attempt to found a [[colony]]. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was heard from his ships again.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;4</ref>

[[Image:Matthew-BristolHarbour-Aug2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A replica of ''The Matthew'', [[John Cabot]]'s ship used for his second voyage to the [[New World]]]]

No further attempts to establish English colonies overseas were made until well into the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], during the last decades of the 16th century.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;35</ref> The [[English Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] had made enemies of England and [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic]] Spain.<ref name="ferguson3"/> In the [[Anglo<U+2013>Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]], the English Crown sanctioned [[privateer]]s such as [[John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]] to engage in piratical attacks on Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the [[New World]].<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;7</ref> At the same time, influential writers such as [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] (who was the first to use the term "British Empire")<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;62</ref> were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire, to rival those of Spain and Portugal. By this time, Spain was firmly entrenched in the Americas, Portugal had established a string of trading posts and forts from the coasts of [[Africa]] and [[Brazil]] to [[China]], and [[French colonial empire|France]] had begun to settle the [[Saint Lawrence River]], later to become [[New France]].

===Plantations of Ireland===
Though a relative late comer to overseas colonisation in comparison to Spain and Portugal, England had been engaged in a form of 'domestic colonisation' in [[Ireland]].<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;7</ref> The 16th century [[Plantations of Ireland]], run by English colonists, were a precursor to the overseas Empire,<ref>[[#refTaylor2001|Taylor]], p.&nbsp;123</ref> and several people involved in these projects also had a hand in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the "West Country men", which included [[Humphrey Gilbert]], [[Walter Raleigh]], [[Francis Drake]], [[John Hawkins]], [[Richard Grenville]] and [[Ralph Lane]].<ref>[[#refTaylor2001|Taylor]], p.&nbsp;119</ref>

=="First British Empire" (1583<U+2013>1783)==

In 1578 [[Queen Elizabeth I]] granted a patent to Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] for discovery and overseas exploration.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;466</ref> That year, Gilbert sailed for the [[West Indies]] with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in [[North America]], but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;466</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;63</ref> In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] whose harbour he formally claimed for England, though no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Walter Raleigh]], who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584.  Later that year, Raleigh founded the colony of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] on the coast of present-day [[North Carolina]], but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], pp.&nbsp;63&ndash;4</ref>

In 1603, King [[James VI of Scotland]] ascended to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]], ending hostilities with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructure to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;70</ref> Although its beginnings were hit-and-miss, the British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the English settlement of [[North America]] and the smaller islands of the [[Caribbean]], and the establishment of a private company, the [[British East India Company|English East India Company]], to trade with [[Asia]]. This period, until the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] after the [[American War of Independence]] towards the end of the 18th century, has subsequently been referred to as the "First British Empire".<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;34</ref>

===Americas, Africa and the slave trade===
The [[Caribbean]] initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;17</ref> but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in [[British Guiana|Guiana]] in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find [[gold]] deposits.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;71</ref> Colonies in [[St Lucia]]&nbsp;(1605) and [[Grenada]]&nbsp;(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in [[St. Kitts]]&nbsp;(1624), [[Barbados]]&nbsp;(1627) and [[Nevis]]&nbsp;(1628).<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;221</ref> The colonies soon adopted the system of [[sugar plantation]]s successfully used by the Portuguese in [[Brazil]], which depended on [[slave labour]], and<U+2014>at first<U+2014>Dutch ships, to sell the [[Slavery|slaves]] and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament [[Navigation Acts|decreed]] in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the [[Dutch Republic|United Dutch Provinces]]<U+2014>a series of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]<U+2014>which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch. In 1655 England annexed the island of [[Jamaica]] from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the [[Bahamas]].

[[Image:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|left|British colonies in North America, c. 1750. 1: [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]; 2: [[Nova Scotia]]; 3: The [[Thirteen Colonies]]; 4: [[Bermuda]]; 5: [[Bahamas]]; 6: [[British Honduras]]; 7: [[Jamaica]]; 8: [[Lesser Antilles]]]]

England's first permanent overseas settlement was founded in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], led by Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] and managed by the [[London Company|Virginia Company]], an offshoot of which established a colony on [[Bermuda]], which had been discovered in 1609. The Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control was assumed by the [[Crown colony|crown]], thereby founding the [[Colony of Virginia]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;600</ref> The [[Newfoundland Company]] was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] was founded as a haven for [[puritan]] religious separatists, later known as the [[Pilgrims]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;897</ref> Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous [[trans-Atlantic]] voyage: [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] was founded as a haven for [[Roman Catholics]]&nbsp;(1634), [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]]&nbsp;(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut&nbsp;(1639) for [[congregationalist]]s. The [[Province of Carolina]] was founded in 1663. In 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] (renamed [[New York, New York|New York]]) via negotiations following the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|Second Anglo-Dutch War]], in exchange for [[Suriname]]. In 1681, the colony of [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] was founded by [[William Penn]]. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&nbsp;72&ndash;3</ref> <!-- Insert some discussion of interaction with Native Indians here -->

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted a charter to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], granting it a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in what was then known as [[Rupert's Land]], a vast stretch of territory that would later make up a large proportion of [[Canada]]. Forts and trading posts established by the Company were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent [[New France]].<ref name="buckner25">[[#Buckner2008|Buckner]], p.&nbsp;25</ref>

[[Image:Treaty of Paris by Benjamin West 1783.jpg|thumb|''The Treaty of Paris'', by Benjamin West (1783) depicting (from left to right) [[John Jay]], [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Henry Laurens]] and [[William Temple Franklin]]. The British commissioners refused to pose, so the painting was never finished.]]

Two years later, the [[Royal African Company]] was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean.<ref>[[#Lloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;37</ref>
From the outset, [[slavery]] was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported across the Atlantic]].<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;62</ref> To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of [[West Africa]], such as [[James Island (The Gambia)|James Island]], [[Jamestown, Ghana|Accra]] and [[Bunce Island]]. In the British [[Caribbean]], the percentage of the population of [[black people]] rose from 25 percent in 1650 to around 80 percent in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10 percent to 40 percent over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies).<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;228</ref> For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]], which formed the third corner of the so-called [[triangular trade]] with Africa and the Americas. For the transportees, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the [[middle passage]] was one in seven.<ref>[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;440&ndash;64</ref>

In 1695 the Scottish parliament granted a charter to the [[Company of Scotland]], which proceeded in 1698 to establish a settlement on the [[isthmus of Panama]], with a view to building a [[canal]] there. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], and afflicted by [[malaria]], the colony was abandoned two years later. The [[Darien scheme]] was a financial disaster for Scotland&mdash;a quarter of Scottish capital<ref>[[#refMagnusson2003|Magnusson]], p.&nbsp;531</ref> was lost in the enterprise&mdash;and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns.<ref>[[#refMacaulay1979|Macaulay]], p.&nbsp;509</ref> This was achieved in 1707 with the [[Treaty of Union]], establishing the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain]].

===Rivalry with the Netherlands in Asia===
At the end of the 16th century, [[England]] and [[the Netherlands]] began to challenge [[Portugal]]'s monopoly of trade with [[Asia]], forming private [[joint-stock]] companies to finance the voyages<U+2014>the [[British East India Company|English]] (later British) and [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] East India Companies, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative [[spice trade]], and they focused their efforts on the source, the [[Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[archipelago]], and an important hub in the trade network, [[India]]. The close proximity of [[London]] and [[Amsterdam]] across the [[North Sea]] and intense rivalry between [[England]] and the [[Netherlands]] inevitably led to conflict between the two companies, with the Dutch gaining the upper hand in the [[Moluccas]] (previously a Portuguese stronghold) after the withdrawal of the English in 1622, and the English enjoying more success in India, at [[Surat, Gujarat|Surat]], after the establishment of a factory in 1613. Though England would ultimately eclipse the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands's more advanced financial system<ref name="ferguson19">[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;19</ref> and the three [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 when the Dutch [[William III of England|William of Orange]] ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the Indonesian archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the English company had overtaken the Dutch.<ref name="ferguson19"/> The English East India Company shifted its focus from Surat<U+2014>a hub of the spice trade network<U+2014>to [[Fort St George]] (later to become [[Madras]]), [[Bombay]] (ceded by the Portuguese to [[Charles II of England]] in 1661 as dowry for [[Catherine de Braganza]]) and [[Sutanuti]] (which would merge with two other villages to form [[Calcutta]]).

===Global struggles with France===
Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the [[Nine Years' War]] as allies, but the conflict<U+2014>waged in [[Europe]] and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance<U+2014>left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe.<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;441</ref> The 18th century would see England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.<ref>[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&nbsp;90</ref>

The death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]], a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1045</ref> In 1701, Britain, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against [[Spain]] and [[France]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which lasted until 1714.  At the concluding [[Treaty of Utrecht]], Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1122</ref> The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Acadia]], and from Spain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Minorca]]. [[Gibraltar]], which is still a [[British overseas territory]] to this day, became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the [[Mediterranean]]. Minorca was returned to Spain at the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in 1802, after changing hands twice. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative ''[[asiento]]'' (permission to sell slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], pp.&nbsp;1121&ndash;22</ref> 

The [[Seven Years' War]], which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and coastal Africa. The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to [[Rupert's Land]],<ref name="buckner25"/> the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizeable [[Quebec|French-speaking population]] under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded [[Florida]] to Britain. In India, the [[Carnatic Wars#Third Carnatic War (1756-1763)|Carnatic War]] had left France still in control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. The British victory over France in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.<ref>[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&nbsp;91</ref>

==Rise of the "Second British Empire" (1783<U+2013>1815)==
[[Image:Clive.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Clive]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] established the Company as a military as well as a commercial power.]]
===Company rule in India===
{{main|Company rule in India}}
During its first century of operation, the [[English East India Company]] focused on trade, rather than empire building, with the Company no match for the powerful [[Mughal Empire]],<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;93</ref> which had granted the Company trading rights in 1617. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the ''[[French East India Company|La Compagnie fran<U+00E7>aise des Indes orientales]]'', during the [[Carnatic Wars]] in south-eastern India in the 1740s and 1750s. The [[Battle of Plassey]], which saw the British, led by [[Robert Clive]], defeat the French and their Indian allies, left the Company in control of [[Bengal]] and as the major military and political power in India.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;897</ref> In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local puppet rulers under the threat of force from the [[British Indian Army]], the vast majority of which was composed of native Indian [[sepoys]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;995</ref> The Company's conquest of [[British Raj|India]] was complete by 1857.

===Loss of the Thirteen Colonies in America===
{{main|American Revolution}}
During the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent,<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;73</ref> summarised at the time by the slogan "[[No taxation without representation]]". Disagreement over the American colonists' [[Rights of Englishmen|guaranteed Rights as Englishmen]] turned to violence and, in 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] began. The following year, the colonists [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of the United States]] and, with assistance from France, would go on to win the war in 1783.

[[Image:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|left|''Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown''. The loss of the American colonies marked the end of the "first British Empire".]]

The loss of such a large portion of [[British America]], at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by historians as the event defining the transition between the "first" and "second" empires,<ref>[[#refOHBEv1|Canny]], p.&nbsp;92</ref> in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal.<ref>[[#refPagden2003|Pagden]], p.&nbsp;91</ref><ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1026</ref> The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;119</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv2|Marshall]], p.&nbsp;585</ref> Tensions between the two nations escalated during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France, and boarded American ships to [[Impressment|impress]] into the Royal Navy men of British birth. The U.S. declared war, the [[War of 1812]], in which both sides tried to make major gains at the other's expense. Both failed and the peace treaty ratified in 1815 kept the pre-war boundaries.<ref>[[#refLatimer|Latimer]], pp.&nbsp;8, 30&ndash;4, 389&ndash;92</ref>

Events in America influenced British policy in [[Canada]], where between 40,000 and 100,000<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;685</ref> defeated [[Loyalists]] had migrated from America following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the Saint John River in Nova Scotia felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off [[New Brunswick]] as a separate colony in 1784.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;796</ref> The [[Constitutional Act of 1791]] created the provinces of [[Upper Canada]] (mainly English-speaking) and [[Lower Canada]] (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;28.</ref>

===Exploration of the Pacific===
[[Image:Captainjamescookportrait.jpg|thumb|The voyages of discovery by [[James Cook]] in the Pacific Ocean led to the founding of several British colonies, including Australia and New Zealand.]]
Since 1718, [[penal transportation|transportation]] to the American colonies had been a penalty for various criminal offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;20</ref> Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia.<ref name="refhdbe808">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;808</ref> The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by a Dutch explorer in 1606 and was later named by the [[Dutch East India Company]] [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]],<ref name="refhdbe806">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;806</ref> but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 [[James Cook]] discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific [[First voyage of James Cook|voyage]] to the [[South Pacific Ocean]], claimed the continent for Britain, and named it [[New South Wales]].<ref name="refhdbe808"/> In 1778 [[Joseph Banks]], Cook's [[botanist]] on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of [[Botany Bay]] for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]] set sail, arriving in 1788.<ref name="refhdbe808"/> Britain continued to transport convicts to Australia until 1840, at which time the colony's population numbered 56,000, the majority of whom were convicts, ex-convicts or their descendants.<ref name="refhdbe87">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;87</ref> The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold.<ref name="refhdbe87"/>

During his voyage, Cook also visited [[New Zealand]], first discovered by Dutch sailors in 1642, and claimed the [[North Island|North]] and [[South Island|South]] islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the native [[Maori]] population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the [[New Zealand Company]] announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain [[William Hobson]] and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1137</ref> This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/waitangi-day|title=Waitangi Day|publisher=History Group, New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;579</ref> have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.<ref>[[#refMeinSmith|Mein Smith]], p.&nbsp;49</ref>

===War with Napoleonic France===
Britain was challenged again by France under [[Napoleon]], in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;152</ref> It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.
[[Image:BritishEmpire1815.png|thumb|The British Empire following the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1815<ref>[[#refDalziel|Dalziel]], pp.&nbsp;64&ndash;5</ref>]]
The [[Napoleonic Wars]] were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the [[Royal Navy]], which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815. Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the [[United States of the Ionian Islands|Ionian Islands]] and [[Malta]] (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], [[St Lucia]] and [[Tobago]]; Spain ceded [[Trinidad]]; the Netherlands [[British Guiana|Guyana]] and the [[Cape Colony]]. Britain returned [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Goree]], [[French Guiana]] and [[R<U+00E9>union]] to France, and [[Java]] and [[Suriname]] to the Netherlands.

===Abolition of slavery===
Under increasing pressure from the [[abolitionist]] movement, Britain outlawed the [[slave trade]] (1807) and soon began enforcing this principle on other nations. In 1808, [[Sierra Leone]] was designated an official British colony for freed slaves.<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;14</ref> The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] passed in 1833 made not just the slave trade but slavery itself illegal, emancipating all slaves in the British Empire on 1 August 1834.<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;204</ref>

==Britain's imperial century (1815<U+2013>1914)==
[[Image:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps]]
Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's "imperial century" by some historians,<ref>[[#refHyam2002|Hyam]], p.&nbsp;1</ref><ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;71</ref> around {{mi2 to km2|10000000|precision=0}} of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.<ref>[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&nbsp;3</ref> Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia.<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;401</ref> Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]'',<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;332</ref> and a foreign policy of "[[splendid isolation]]".<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;285</ref>  Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as [[China]], [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been characterised by some historians as an "informal empire".<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;8</ref><ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;156&ndash;7</ref>

British imperial strength was underpinned by the [[steamship]] and the [[telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]].<ref>[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&nbsp;88&ndash;91</ref>

===East India Company in Asia===
{{See also|British Raj}}
British policy in Asia during the 19th century was chiefly concerned with protecting and expanding India, viewed as its most important colony and the key to the rest of Asia.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]],p.&nbsp;478</ref> The [[East India Company]] drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to cooperate in arenas outside India: the eviction of Napoleon from [[Egypt]] (1799), the capture of [[Java]] from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of [[Singapore]] (1819) and [[Malacca]] (1824) and the defeat of [[Burma]] (1826).<ref>[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&nbsp;401</ref>

From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable [[opium]] export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of [[tea]], which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the seizure by the Chinese authorities at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the [[First Opium War]], and the seizure by Britain of the island of [[Hong Kong]] (then a minor outpost) as a base.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;293</ref>

[[Image:Victoria Disraeli cartoon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|An 1876 political cartoon of Benjamin Disraeli (1804<U+2013>1881) making Queen Victoria Empress of India. The caption was "New crowns for old ones!"]]
The end of the Company was precipitated by a mutiny of [[sepoy]]s against their British commanders, due in part to the tensions caused by British attempts to westernise India.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;567</ref> The [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion]] took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. Afterwards the British government assumed direct control over India, ushering in the period known as the [[British Raj]], where an appointed [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]] administered India and [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was crowned the Empress of India. The East India Company was dissolved the following year, in 1858.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;568</ref>

India suffered a series of serious crop failures in the late-19th century, leading to widespread [[famine in India|famines]] in which at least 10 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. This changed during the Raj, in which commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;133&ndash;4</ref>

===Rivalry with Russia===
During the 19th century, Britain and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and Chinese [[Qing Dynasty|Manchu]] empires.<ref name="refhdbe478">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;478</ref> This rivalry in Eurasia came to be known as the "[[Great Game]]".<ref name="refhdbe478"/> As far as Britain was concerned, the defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey in the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1828<U+2013>1829)]] demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities, and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;181</ref> In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading [[Afghanistan]], but the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] was a disaster for Britain.<ref name="refjames182">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;182</ref> When Russia invaded the Turkish [[Balkans]] in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Middle East]] led Britain and France to invade the [[Crimea|Crimean Peninsula]] in order to destroy Russian naval capabilities.<ref name="refjames182"/> The ensuing [[Crimean War|Crimean War (1854&ndash;56)]], which involved new techniques of modern warfare,<ref>[[#refRoyle2000|Royle]], preface</ref> and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the ''Pax Britannica'', was a resounding defeat for Russia.<ref name="refjames182"/> The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] in 1876 and Russia [[Kirghizia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkmenistan]]. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878, and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]].<ref name="refhdbe478"/>

===Cape to Cairo===
[[Image:Punch Rhodes Colossus.png|thumb|''[[The Rhodes Colossus]]''- [[Cecil John Rhodes|Cecil Rhodes]] spanning "Cape to Cairo"]]
The Dutch East India Company had founded the [[Cape Colony]] on the southern tip of [[Africa]] in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large [[Afrikaner]] (or [[Boer]]) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 in order to prevent it falling into French hands, following the invasion of the Netherlands by France.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;85</ref> British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own&mdash;mostly short-lived&mdash;independent republics, during the [[Great Trek]] of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the [[Voortrekkers]] clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in [[South Africa]] and with several African polities, including those of the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and the [[Zulu]] nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the [[South African Republic]] or Transvaal Republic (1852&ndash;77; 1881&ndash;1902) and the [[Orange Free State]] (1854&ndash;1902). In 1902 Britain completed its military occupation of the Transvaal and Free State by concluding a treaty with the two [[Boer Republics]] following the [[Second Boer War]] 1899&ndash;1902.

In 1869 the Suez Canal was opened under [[Napoleon III]], linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. The Canal was at first opposed by the British,<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1070</ref> but once open its strategic value was recognised quickly. In 1875, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] bought the indebted [[Egypt]]ian ruler [[Ismail Pasha]]'s 44 percent shareholding in the [[Suez Canal]] for <U+00A3>4 million. Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], pp.&nbsp;230&ndash;3</ref> The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;274</ref> but a compromise was reached with the 1888 [[Convention of Constantinople]]. This came into force in 1904 and made the Canal neutral territory, but de facto control was exercised by the British whose forces occupied the area until 1954.

As French, [[Belgian Empire|Belgian]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] activity in the lower [[Congo River]] region threatened to undermine orderly penetration of tropical Africa, the [[Berlin Conference, 1884-85|Berlin Conference]] of 1884&ndash;85 sought to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the "[[Scramble for Africa]]" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims.<ref name="refhdbe989">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;989</ref> The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from [[Sudan]]. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the [[Mahdist War|Madhist Army]] in 1896, and rebuffed a French attempted invasion at [[Fashoda Crisis|Fashoda]] in 1898. Sudan was made an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian Condominium]], a joint protectorate in name, but a British colony in reality.<ref name="refhdbe989"/>

British gains in southern and [[East Africa]] prompted [[Cecil Rhodes]], pioneer of British expansion in Africa, to urge a "[[Cape<U+2013>Cairo Railway|Cape to Cairo]]" railway linking the strategically important [[Suez Canal]] to the mineral-rich South.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;248</ref> In 1888 Rhodes with his privately owned [[British South Africa Company]] occupied and annexed territories named after him, [[Rhodesia (name)|Rhodesia]].

===Changing status of the white colonies===
The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham Report]], which proposed unification and self-government for the two Canadian provinces, as a solution to political unrest there. This was achieved with the passing of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] in 1867, where Canada was labelled a "dominion". [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] achieved similar levels of self-government in 1900, New Zealand as a dominion, and Australia as a commonwealth.<ref name="refhdbe376">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;376</ref> The term "dominion status" was officially introduced at the Imperial Conference of 1907, to refer to Canada, [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], Australia and New Zealand. In 1910, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State were joined together to form the [[Union of South Africa]], also with dominion status.<ref name="refhdbe376"/>

The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted political campaigns for Irish [[home rule]].  Ireland had been absorbed into the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[Act of Union 1800]] after the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and had suffered a severe [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]] between 1845 and 1852.  Home rule was supported by the British [[Prime Minister]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the Empire, but his 1886 [[Irish Government Bill 1886|Home Rule bill]] was defeated in Parliament, as many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to the mainland or be the beginnings of the breakup of the Empire.  A [[Irish Government Bill 1893|second Home Rule bill]] was also defeated for similar reasons.<ref>[[#refJames|James]], p.&nbsp;315</ref>  A [[Home Rule Act 1914|third bill]] was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] leading to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].

==World Wars (1914&ndash;45)==

By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the metropole and the entirety of the Empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of "splendid isolation".<ref>[[#refOBrien|O'Brien]], p.&nbsp;1</ref>  Germany was rising rapidly as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war.  Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;667</ref> and threatened at home by the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German navy]], Britain formed an alliance with [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Japan]] in 1902, and its old enemies [[Entente cordiale|France]] and [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Russia]] in 1904 and 1907.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;275</ref>

===World War I===
Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of [[World War I]].  The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the Dominions, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the [[Crown colonies]].<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;78&ndash;9</ref>  Most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa were quickly invaded and occupied, and in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied [[German New Guinea]] and [[Samoa]] respectively. The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on [[ANZAC Day]]. Canadians viewed the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in a similar light.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;227</ref>  The important contribution of the Dominions to the war effort was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an [[Imperial War Cabinet]] to coordinate imperial policy.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;278</ref>

Under the terms of the concluding [[Treaty of Versailles]] signed in 1919, the Empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of {{mi2 to km2|1800000|precision=-3}} and 13 million new subjects<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;315</ref> The colonies of [[Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were distributed to the Allied powers as [[League of Nations Mandate]]s. Britain gained control of [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine, Transjordan]], [[British Mandate of Iraq|Iraq]], parts of [[Cameroons|Cameroon]] and [[Togo]], and [[Tanganyika]]. The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: [[South-West Africa]] (modern-day [[Namibia]]) was given to the [[Union of South Africa]], Australia gained [[German New Guinea]], and [[New Zealand]] [[Western Samoa]]. [[Nauru]] was made a combined mandate of the two Pacific Dominions and Britain.<ref>[[#refHDBEv1|Olson]], p.&nbsp;658</ref>

===Inter-war period===
[[Image:BritishEmpire1919.png|thumb|The British Empire following the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, at its greatest extent]]

The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy.<ref>[[#refGoldstein|Goldstein]], p.&nbsp;4</ref>  Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]], where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States.<ref name="reflouis302">[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;302</ref>  This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;294</ref> as right-wing, militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the [[Great Depression]], for it was feared that the Empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations.<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;303</ref>  Although the issue of the Empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, at the same time the Empire was vital to the British economy: during the inter-war period, exports to the colonies and Dominions increased from 32 to 39 percent of all exports overseas, and imports increased from 24 to 37 percent.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;181</ref>

In 1919 the frustrations caused by delays to [[Irish home rule]] led members of [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]], a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats at Westminster in the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 British general election]], to establish an [[D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann|Irish assembly]] in [[Dublin]], at which Irish independence was declared. The [[Irish Republican Army]] simultaneously began a [[guerilla]] war against the British administration.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;143</ref> The [[Anglo-Irish War]] ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]].  The 26 counties of the south were formed into the [[Irish Free State]], a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown,<ref>[[#refHDBEv1|Olson]], p.&nbsp;58</ref> while the six counties of the province of [[Northern Ireland]] which had been [[Government of Ireland Act 1920|established in 1920]]<ref>[[#refHDBEv1|Olson]], p.&nbsp;822</ref> remained a part of the United Kingdom.
[[Image:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|left|King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the 1926 [[Imperial Conferences|Imperial Conference]]]]
A similar struggle began in India when the [[Government of India Act 1919]] failed to satisfy demand for independence.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;330</ref> Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the [[Ghadar Conspiracy]] ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the [[Rowlatt Acts]], creating tension,<ref name="refjames416">[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;416</ref> particularly in the Punjab, where repressive measures culminated in the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar Massacre]]. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion.<ref name="refjames416"/> The subsequent [[non-cooperation movement]] was called off in March 1922 following the [[Chauri Chaura]] incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.

In 1922 Egypt, which had been declared a British [[protectorate]] at the outbreak of World War I, was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a British [[client state]] until 1954.  British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] in 1936,<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], pp.&nbsp;400,1072</ref> under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the [[Suez Canal]] zone.  In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;292</ref>  [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Iraq]], a British [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] since 1919, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;745</ref>

The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 [[Imperial Conferences|Imperial Conference]].<ref>[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&nbsp;187</ref> Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the [[Chanak crisis]] the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;68</ref><ref>[[#refMcIntyre|McIntyre]], p.&nbsp;186</ref> After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|1926 Imperial Conference]] declared the Dominions to be "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another" within a "British [[Commonwealth of Nations]]".<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;69</ref> This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]].<ref name="refhdbev1157">[[#refHDBEv1|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1157</ref> The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent.<ref name="refhdbev1157"/>  Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;800</ref>  Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.<ref>[[#refKenny|Kenny]], p.&nbsp;21</ref>

===World War II===
{{main|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II}}
Britain's declaration of war against [[Nazi Germany]] in September 1939 included the [[Crown colonies]] and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions. Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all soon declared war on Germany, but the [[Irish Free State]] chose to remain [[Irish neutrality|legally neutral]] throughout [[The Emergency (Ireland)|the war]].<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], pp.&nbsp;313&ndash;4</ref> After the [[Battle of France|German occupation of France]] in 1940, Britain and the Empire were left standing alone against Germany until the entry of the [[Soviet Union]] to the war in 1941. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] successfully lobbied President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask [[United States Congress|Congress]] to commit the country to war.<ref>[[#refGilbert|Gilbert]], p.&nbsp;234</ref> In August 1941 Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the [[Atlantic Charter]], which included the statement that "the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans and nationalist movements.<ref name="reflloyd316">[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;316</ref><ref>[[#refJames|James]], p.&nbsp;513</ref>

In December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] launched in quick succession attacks on British [[Battle of Malaya|Malaya]], the United States naval base at [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and [[Battle of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]]. Japan had steadily been growing as an imperial power in the Far East since its defeat of China in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895,<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;295</ref> envisioning a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under its leadership. The Japanese attacks on the British and American possessions in the Pacific had an immediate and long-lasting impact on the British Empire. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the Empire was safe,<ref>[[#refGilbert2005|Gilbert]], p.&nbsp;244</ref> but the manner in which the British rapidly surrendered irreversibly altered Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power.<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;337</ref><ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;319</ref> Most damaging of all was the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;460</ref> The realisation that Britain could not defend the entire Empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States, eventually resulting in the 1951 [[ANZUS|ANZUS Pact]] between the three nations, but excluding Britain itself.<ref name="reflloyd316"/>

==Decolonisation and decline (1945<U+2013>1997)==
Though Britain and the Empire emerged victorious from [[World War II]], the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of [[Europe]], a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was now literally in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, to whom the balance of global power had now shifted.<ref>[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&nbsp;146</ref> Britain itself was left virtually [[bankrupt]], with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of a $3.5&nbsp;billion loan from the United States,<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;331</ref> the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm |title=What's a little debt between friends?|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2006|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref>

At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing [[Cold War]] rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union, both nations opposed to the European colonialism of old, though American [[anti-Communism]] prevailed over anti-imperialism, which led the US to support the continued existence of the British Empire.<ref name="refohbev330">[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;330</ref>

The "[[Wind of Change (speech)|wind of change]]" ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to, in contrast to other European powers like France or Portugal,<ref>[[#refAbernethy2000|Abernethy]], p.&nbsp;148</ref> which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965 the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself  fell from 700 million to five million, three million of whom were in [[Hong Kong]].<ref name="refohbev330"/>

===Initial disengagement===
[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Mahatma Gandhi]], a key leader of the [[Indian independence movement]]]]
The pro-decolonisation [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] and led by [[Clement Attlee]], moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the Empire, that of Indian independence.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;322</ref> India's two independence movements&mdash;the [[Indian National Congress]] and the [[Muslim League]]&mdash;had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the [[History of the Indian Navy|Indian Royal Navy]] during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948, but when the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent to Britain's newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, [[Lord Mountbatten]], partitioned independence was hastily brought forward to 15 August 1947.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;67</ref> The borders drawn by the British to broadly [[Partition of India|partition India]] into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;325</ref> Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus in the reverse direction, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the [[British Raj]], and [[Ceylon]] gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Ceylon became members of the [[Commonwealth]], though Burma chose not to join.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;218</ref>

The [[British Mandate of Palestine]], where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India.<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;327</ref> The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to Palestine following [[Nazi]] oppression and genocide in the Second World War. Rather than deal with the issue, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve,<ref>[[#refLloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;328</ref> which it did by voting for the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition of Palestine]] into a Jewish and Arab state.

Following the defeat of Japan in World War II, anti-Japanese resistance movements in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin. The fact that the guerillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted.<ref>[[#Lloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;335</ref> The [[Malayan Emergency]], as it was known, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the [[Federation of Malaya]] within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the Federation was joined with [[Singapore]], [[Sarawak]] and [[British North Borneo]] to form [[Malaysia]], but in 1965 Chinese-dominated [[Singapore]] left the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations.<ref>[[#Lloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;364</ref> [[Brunei]], which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union<ref>[[#Lloyd1996|Lloyd]], p.&nbsp;396</ref> and maintained its status until independence in 1984.

===Suez and its aftermath===
[[Image:AREden.jpg|right|thumb|upright|British Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]]'s decision to invade the [[Suez Canal]] ended his political career and revealed Britain's weakness as an imperial power.]]
In 1951, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the Empire, with the base at the [[Suez Canal]] allowing Britain to maintain its preeminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]]'s new revolutionary government of Egypt that had [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|taken power in 1952]], and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] would become independent by 1955.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], pp.&nbsp;339&ndash;40</ref>

In 1956 Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of the new British Prime Minister, [[Anthony Eden]], was to collude with France to engineer an [[Israel]]i attack on [[Egypt]] that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;581</ref> Eden infuriated his US counterpart, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;355</ref> Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the [[Soviet Union]] after [[Nikita Khrushchev]] threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the [[British pound]] and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;356</ref> Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objective of recapturing the Suez Canal,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;583</ref> UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a very humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;398</ref>

The [[Suez Crisis]] very publicly exposed Britain's limitations to the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;342</ref><ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], pp.&nbsp;105</ref><ref>[[#refBurke2008|Burke]], p.&nbsp;602</ref> The events at Suez wounded British national pride, leading one [[Member of Parliament|MP]] to describe it as "Britain's [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]"<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;343</ref> and another to suggest that the country had become an "American [[Satellite state|satellite]]".<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;585</ref> [[Margaret Thatcher]] later described the mindset she believed had befallen the British political establishment as "Suez syndrome",<ref>[[#refThatcher|Thatcher]]</ref> from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the [[Falkland Islands]] from [[Argentina]] in 1982.

While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse.<ref>[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&nbsp;106</ref> Britain again soon deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in [[Oman]] (1957), [[Jordan]] (1958) and [[Kuwait]] (1961), though on these occasions with American approval,<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;586</ref> as the new Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]]'s foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;343</ref> Britain maintained a presence in the Middle East for another decade, withdrawing from [[Aden]] in 1967, and [[Bahrain]] in 1971.

===Wind of change===
Macmillan gave a [[Wind of Change|speech]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] in February 1960 where he spoke of "the wind of change blowing through this continent."<ref name="refhdbe1165">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1165</ref> Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of colonial war that France was fighting in [[French Algeria|Algeria]], and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly.<ref>[[#refLouis2006|Louis]], p.&nbsp;46</ref> To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the 1950s&mdash;Sudan, the Gold Coast and Malaya&mdash;were added nearly ten times that number in the 1960s.<ref name="refhdbe1165"/>

[[Image:British Decolonisation in Africa.png|left|thumb|British decolonisation in Africa. By the end of the 1960s, all but [[Rhodesia]] (the future [[Zimbabwe]]) and the South African mandate of [[South West Africa]] ([[Namibia]]) had achieved independence.]]
Britain's remaining colonies in Africa were all granted independence by 1968 (''see map''). British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was complicated by the region's white settler populations, particularly in [[Rhodesia]] where racial tensions had led [[Ian Smith]], the Prime Minister, to a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] from the British Empire in 1965.<ref name="refhdbe945">[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;945</ref> Rhodesia remained in a state of civil war between its black and white population until the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, under which Rhodesia was temporarily returned to British colonial rule until elections could be held, under British supervision. The elections were held the following year and won by [[Robert Mugabe]], who became the Prime Minister of the newly independent state of [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;715</ref>

In the Mediterranean, a guerrilla war waged by [[EOKA|Greek Cypriots]] ended (1960) in an independent [[Cyprus]], with the UK retaining the military bases of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]. The Mediterranean islands of [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]] were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of [[History of Malta#Attempted integration with the United Kingdom|integration with Britain]].<ref name="refhdbe945"/>

Most of the UK's [[Caribbean|West Indies]] territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]] from the [[West Indies Federation]], established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two by far largest members.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1155</ref> [[Barbados]] achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s, but [[Anguilla]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1111</ref> The [[British Virgin Islands]],<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;1133</ref> [[Cayman Islands]]<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;276</ref> and [[Montserrat]]<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;753</ref> opted to retain ties with Britain. [[Guyana]] achieved independence from the UK in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, [[British Honduras]], became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed [[Belize]] in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981.  A [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory|dispute with Guatemala]] over claims to Belize was left unresolved.

British territories in the Pacific acquired independence between 1970 ([[Fiji]]) and 1980 ([[Vanuatu]]), the latter's independence having been delayed due political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] with France.<ref name="refhdbe806"/> [[Tuvalu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Papua New Guinea]] chose to remain [[Commonwealth realms]].

===End of empire===

The granting of independence to Rhodesia and Vanuatu in 1980 and British Honduras in 1981 meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts (and the acquisition in 1955 of an uninhabited rock in the Atlantic Ocean, [[Rockall]]),<ref>{{cite web|title = 1955: Britain claims Rockall|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete.

In 1982, Britain's resolve to defend its remaining overseas territories was tested when [[Argentina]] invaded the [[Falkland Islands]], acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;419</ref> Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing [[Falklands War]] was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in the UK's status as a world power.<ref>[[#refJames2001|James]], p.&nbsp;629</ref>

The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by patriating the Canadian constitution from Britain. The [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] passed by the British parliament ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution.<ref name="refohbev594">[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;594</ref>  Equivalent acts were passed for [[Australia Act 1986|Australia]] and [[Constitution Act 1986|New Zealand]] in 1986.<ref>[[#refOHBEv4|Brown]], p.&nbsp;689</ref>

In September 1982, the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher travelled to [[Beijing]] to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, [[Hong Kong]].<ref>[[#Brendon|Brendon]], p.&nbsp;654</ref> Under the terms of the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]], [[Hong Kong Island]] itself had been ceded to Britain "in perpetuity", but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the [[New Territories]], which had been acquired under a [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory|99 year lease in 1898]], due to expire in 1997.<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olson]], p.&nbsp;533</ref> Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China.<ref>[[#Brendon|Brendon]], pp.&nbsp;654&ndash;5</ref> A deal was reached in 1984&mdash;under the terms of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], Hong Kong would become a [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|Special Administrative Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years.<ref>[[#Brendon|Brendon]], p.&nbsp;656</ref> The [[Hong Kong handover ceremony|handover ceremony]] in 1997 marked for many,<ref>[[#Brendon|Brendon]], p.&nbsp;660</ref> including [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4740684.stm|title=Charles' diary lays thoughts bare|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> who was in attendance, "the end of Empire".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/endofempire_overview_07.shtml|title=BBC - History - Britain, the Commonwealth and the End of Empire|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="refohbev594"/>

==Legacy==
The UK retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside of the British Isles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1013618138295|title=UK Overseas Territories&nbsp;Foreign and Commonwealth Office|publisher=UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=5 September 2007}}</ref> collectively named the [[British overseas territories]], which remain under British rule because of lack of support for independence among the local population or because the territory is uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel. British sovereignty of several of the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: [[Gibraltar]] is claimed by [[Spain]], the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are claimed by [[Argentina]], and the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] is claimed by [[Mauritius]] and [[Seychelles]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html#Issues|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref> The [[British Antarctic Territory]] is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and [[Chile]], while many nations do not recognise any territorial claims to Antarctica.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ay.html#Issues|title=Antarctica|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=13 December 2008}}</ref>

[[Image:Location of the BOTs.png|left|thumb|The fourteen [[British overseas territories]]]]
Most former British colonies (and one former Portuguese colony, Mozambique)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/FAQs/20706/faqs/#skipTo33535 |title=Commonwealth Secretariat - FAQs|publisher=The Commonwealth|accessdate=20 November 2008}}</ref> are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a non-political, voluntary association of equal members, in which the UK has no privileged status. The head of the Commonwealth is currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Fifteen members of the Commonwealth continue to share their head of state with the UK, as [[Commonwealth realms]].

Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire. The [[English language]] is the primary language of over 300 million people, and the secondary language of over 400 million,<ref>[[#refCrystal|Crystal]], p.&nbsp;109</ref> helped in part by the cultural influence of the United States, itself a product of the British Empire. The English [[parliamentary system]] served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and [[English law|English common law]] for legal systems.<ref>[[#refFergusonEmpire2004|Ferguson 2004]], p.&nbsp;307</ref> The British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], one of the UK's highest courts of appeal, still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. British [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] who fanned out across the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread the [[Anglican Communion]] to all continents. British colonial [[architecture]], such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, continues to stand in many cities that were once part of the British Empire.<ref>[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&nbsp;238&ndash;40</ref> Ball games that were developed in Victorian Britain<U+2014>[[Association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[lawn tennis]] and (from Scotland) [[golf]]<ref>[[#refHDBE|Olsen]], pp.&nbsp;1051&ndash;6</ref><U+2014>were exported, as were the British choice of system of measurement, the [[Imperial units|imperial system]], and the British convention of [[driving on the left or right|driving on the left hand side of the road]].

Political boundaries drawn by the British as they granted independence to colonies did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in [[Kashmir conflict|Kashmir]], [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Palestine]], [[First Sudanese Civil War|Sudan]], [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigeria]] and [[Sri Lankan Civil War|Sri Lanka]]. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. British settlement of Ireland continues to leave its mark in the form of divided Catholic and Protestant communities. Millions of people also moved between British colonies, with large numbers of [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indians]] emigrating to other parts of the Empire, creating the conditions for the [[expulsion of Indians in Uganda in 1972]] and the [[1987 Fijian coups d'<U+00E9>tat]]. The makeup of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War with [[immigration to the United Kingdom]] from the colonies to which it was granting independence.<ref>[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], p.&nbsp;135</ref>
