'''George Dana Boardman the Younger''' (1828-1903) was born in [[Myanmar|Burma]], the son of the [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] [[George Boardman|George Dana Boardman]] and [[Sarah Hall Boardman]]. He returned to the United States as a boy and attended [[Brown University]], where he graduated in [[1852]]. He continued his education at the [[Newton Theological Institution]] and graduated in [[1855]]. He was [[pastor]] of the First Church, [[Philadelphia]], from 1864 to 1894.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_International_Encyclopedia] In June, 1899, he established at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] the permanent lectureship known as the "[[Boardman Foundation in Christian Ethics]]."  He was president of the [[Christian Arbitration and Peace Society]] and of the [[American Baptist Missionary Union]].  His most important production is a [[book|monograph]], ''Titles of Wednesday Evening Lectures''.  It embraces 981 of his lectures, delivered between 1865 and 1880, and comprises a complete [[exegesis]] of the [[Bible]].  

He is probably best remembered for the quotation attributed to him as:

''The law of the harvest is to reap more than you sow. Sow an act, and you reap a habit; sow a habit, and you reap a character; sow a character, and you reap a destiny.''
