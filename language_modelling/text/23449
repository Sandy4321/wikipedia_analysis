'''NSB Class 93''' ({{lang-no|NSB type 93}}) is a [[tilting train|tilting]] two-carriage [[diesel multiple unit]] used by [[Norges Statsbaner]] for passenger trains on non-electrified stretches of the [[Rail transport in Norway|Norwegian railway network]]. Used on the [[Nordland Line]], the [[R<U+00F8>ros Line]] and the [[Rauma Line]], they were purchased to replace the aging [[NSB Di3|Di3]] locomotive-hauled trains. The Class 93 was produced by [[Bombardier]], and is part of the [[Talent (train)|Talent]] family. Fifteen units were delivered between 2000 and 2002.

Powered by two [[Cummins, Inc.|Cummins]] diesel engines with a combined output of {{convert|612|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, the trains are capable of speeds of {{Convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The trains entered service as part of the [[NSB Agenda|Agenda]] regional train concept. However, the technical problems to which the units have been prone and a cramped interior design have made them unpopular among riders. In 2007, they were replaced by locomotive-hauled trains on the Nordland Line.

==Background==
During the mid-1990s, Norges Statsbaner (NSB) had initiated a program to replace the traditional locomotive and carriage trains with new, tilting multiple units. This had led to the order of sixteen [[NSB BM73|Class 73]] four-car units for the three mainline routes on the [[Bergen Line|Bergen]], [[Dovre Line|Dovre]] and [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]]s. To supplement this, on 14 November 1996 the board of NSB decided to purchase seven tilting diesel multiple units for the R<U+00F8>ros and Rauma Lines. In particular, the ageing Di3 locomotives would be retired within five years, and NSB was reluctant to purchase new diesel locomotives for passenger trains.<ref name=krogrud>{{cite journal |author=Krogrud, Svein |title=Type 93 - NSBs nye Talbot Talent |year=2000 |volume=103 |pages=4<U+2013>8 |journal=[[P<U+00E5> Sporet]]}}</ref> The failure of the [[NSB Di6|Di6]], which were returned to the manufacturer [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], further motivated NSB to avoid locomotive-hauled trains.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Di 6-saken l<U+00F8>st |author=[[P<U+00E5> Sporet]] |journal=P<U+00E5> Sporet |year=1999 |volume=98 |pages=53}}</ref>

Three bids were submitted by the deadline of 1 April 1997, and the contract with [[Waggonfabrik Talbot KG|Talbot]] (that had just been bought by Bombardier) was finalized on 27 November 1997. By this time the order had been extended to eleven units, which are variations of the Talbot Talent. Before delivery a further four units were purchased, so the trains could operate all the services on the Nordland Line, replacing most of the locomotive-hauled day trains. Only the [[NSB Night Train|night train]] would remain locomotive-hauled.<ref name=krogrud />

==Specifications==
{{main|Talent (train)}}
The Class 93 is a double-car diesel multiple unit with a built-in tilting mechanism to allow faster speeds on conventional track. A double-car is {{convert|38.21|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2.92|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|3.97|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. Empty weight is {{convert|77|t|ton|abbr=on}}. The body is built in modular stainless steel, with the bottom, sides and top bolted together.<ref name=krogrud />

There are two [[Cummins]] N14E-R diesel engines, with a combined power of {{convert|612|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. The [[engine displacement|displacement]] is {{convert|14|l|impgal|abbr=on}}; full power is achieved at 1,500 rpm. There is a five-stage gear box, and a fuel capacity of two tanks each of {{convert|1140|l|impgal|abbr=on}}. There are three bogies, of which the ends are powered. Maximum speed is {{Convert|140|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The tilting mechanism allows 5<U+00B0> tilting of the entire frame.<ref name=krogrud />

The interior is in red and wood. The central part, including both doors on each side, are on a low-floor section, while the area at the front is higher.<ref name=krogrud /> The original seating configuration was for 88 seats, but due to customer complaints about lack of [[seat pitch]], NSB has reconfigured the trains in 2006 to 76 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ranablad.no/nyheter/article1999362.ece |title=Garanterer bedre plass p<U+00E5> Agenda |author=Forbord, Arne |publisher=[[Rana Blad]] |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=nsb>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsb.no/on_board/types_of_trains/class-93-article24704-2764.html |title=Class 93 |author=[[Norges Statsbaner]] |accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref> Trains are equipped with [[vending machines]] for simple refreshments.

==Operations==
The Class 93 was put into service as part of the [[NSB Agenda|Agenda]] regional train concept.<ref name=krogrud /> Along with the [[NSB BM70|Class 70]] [[NSB InterCity Express|InterCity Express]] trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and R<U+00F8>ros Line.<ref name=nsb /> The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article263355.ece |title=Agendatogene f<U+00E5>r f<U+00E6>rre og bedre seter |author=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article256786.ece |title=Seks av 11 Agenda-tog ute av drift|author=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2002-01-11 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from [[Ofotbanen (company)|Ofotbanen]]. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article263358.ece |title=NSB solgte tog billig, m<U+00E5> n<U+00E5> leie dem dyrt  |author=Holm, Per Annar |publisher=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2002-01-24 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were unsatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kommentarer/article549719.ece |title=Merker som ikke varer  |author=Aspaas, Kathrine |publisher=[[Aftenposten]] |date=2003-05-21 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

[[Image:Saltfjellet.jpg|thumb|A Class 93 unit crossing [[Saltfjellet]] on the Nordland Line.]]
On the Rauma Line, the units are used as feeders between the Oslo<U+2013>Trondheim express trains on the Dovre Line, connecting [[Domb<U+00E5>s Station|Domb<U+00E5>s]] to [[<U+00C5>ndalsnes Station|<U+00C5>ndalsnes]]. On the R<U+00F8>ros Line, the trains are used both on the [[Hamar Station|Hamar]]<U+2013>[[R<U+00F8>ros Station|R<U+00F8>ros]] and the R<U+00F8>ros<U+2013>Trondheim section. On the Nordland Line, the Class 93 serves both the Ole Tobias service between Trondheim and [[Mo i Rana]]. The unit was considered for use on the [[Mer<U+00E5>ker Line]] as well, but this has continued to be operated by [[NSB BM92|Class 92]] units. The initial plan was that eight of the eleven units were needed for daily operations. Four on the R<U+00F8>ros Line, two on the Nordland Line and two on the Rauma Line. The additional four units were needed for operating the Trondheim<U+2013>Bod<U+00F8> trains on the Nordland Line, of which three would be used at any one time. Double units (four cars) are sometimes operated on the Trondheim<U+2013>Mo i Rana train, as are the Friday and Sunday afternoon trains on the Rauma Line, for exchange of equipment, and to handle the increased traffic on these days.<ref name=krogrud /> In addition, NSB uses the trains on the commuter services Bod<U+00F8><U+2013>[[Fauske]]<U+2013>[[Rognan]] and Mo i Rana<U+2013>[[Mosj<U+00F8>en]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.an.no/nyheter/article830391.ece |title=Saltenpendelen en braksuksess for NSB  |author=Snefjell<U+00E5>, Svein |publisher=[[Avisa Nordland]] |date=2003-12-23 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In 2007, the Trondheim<U+2013>Bod<U+00F8> service was again operated by [[NSB Di 4|Di 4]] locomotive-hauled trains. This is the longest rail service in the country, and customers were dissatisfied with the comfort of the Class 93, despite the higher permitted speeds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helgeland-arbeiderblad.no/nyheter/article2593977.ece |title=Lok og vogner p<U+00E5> Nordlandsbanen |author=Forbord, Arne |publisher=[[Helgeland Arbeiderblad]] |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2009-01-12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
