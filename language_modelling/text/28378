The cruiser [[HMS Argyll (1904)|HMS ''Argyll'']] went aground on [[Bell Rock Lighthouse|Bell Rock]] near [[Dundee]] on 28 October 1915 after failing to sight the light due to a failure of communications between the ship and the lighthouse.  ''Jackal'' and [[HMS Hornet (1911)|''Hornet'']] were diverted from their patrol to assist and rescued the crew of approximately 650; there were no fatalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellrock.org.uk/misc/misc_argyll.htm|title=Bell Rock Lighthouses - the loss of HMS ''Argyll'', 1915|accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref>

===Transfer to Third Battle Squadron===
The First Destroyer Flotilla was transferred to the Third Battle Squadron in the Spring of 1916<ref name=BC/> to act as an anti-submarine screen for the Battlecruisers.  ''Jackal'' was not present with her flotilla at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916.

===SS ''Lanfranc''===
On 17 April 1917 at 19:30 [[SS Lanfranc|SS ''Lanfranc'']] was torpedoed 4 miles northeast of [[Le Havre]] by [[SM UB-40|''UB-40'']] while bound for [[Southampton]]. At the time she had 387 patients, of which 167 were German [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], and of these patients, 326 were cot-bound. Approximately 570 survivors were picked up by [[HMS Badger (1911)|''Badger'']] and ''Jackal'', aided by [[HMS P47|HMS ''P47'']] and the French patrol boat ''Roitelet'', and taken to [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluestarline.org/booth/lanfranc2.html|title=Blue Star Line website - Lanfranc 2|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>

===Mediterranean Service===
In 1917 the Third Battle Squadron was sent to the Mediterranean, where they took part in the [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I#1918|1918 Naval campaign in the Adriatic]], including enforcing the [[Otranto Barrage]].  

On the night of 22-23 April 1918 the [[T<U+00E1>tra class destroyer|''T<U+00E1>tra''-class destroyers]] ''Triglav'', ''Uzsok'', ''Dukla'', ''Lika'' and ''Csepel'' under Fregattenkapit<U+00E4>n Karl Herkner<ref name=BOS>{{cite book|last=Halpern|first=Paul G|title=The Battle of the Otranto Straits: Controlling the Gateway to the Adriatic in World War I|year=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253343796}}
</ref> carried out a raid to interrupt Allied shipping between Italy and Albania south of Valona (now [[Vlor<U+00EB>]], Albania).  ''Jackal'', [[HMS Hornet (1911)|''Hornet'']], [[HMS Alarm (1910)|''Alarm'']], [[HMS Comet (1910)|''Comet'']], the Australian [[HMAS Torrens (D67)|''Torrens'']] and the French destroyer [[French ship Cimeterre|''Cimeterre'']] were formed into three groups, with ten miles between each group.  ''Jackal'' and ''Hornet'' encountered the Austro-Hungarian ships and turned towards, making the challenge signal.  At a range of {{convert|1.5|nmi|km}} the Austro-Hungarian destroyers opened fire, concentrating their fire on ''Hornet''.  Both British ships turned away, making smoke, with the intention of drawing the enemy south, but ''Hornet'' took a hit in the forward shell room and magazine, starting fires in both compartments and causing an explosion.<ref name=BOS/>  The bridge and tiller flat both received further hits, and the rudder jammed hard over to starboard, leaving the ship circling hard under fire. ''Jackal'' was turned to the east by her captain, Lt Cdr A M Roberts, but after approximately 15 minutes of firing, Herkner in ''Triglav'' broke off the engagement, reasoning that the alarm had certainly been raised.  ''Jackal'' continued the pursuit, but the faster Austro-Hungarians pulled ahead, and she lost sight of them by 00:20.  ''Alarm'', ''Torrens'' and ''Cimeterre'' had caught up with ''Jackal'' by 00:45, but by 01:35 the pursuit was called off.<ref name=BOS/>

''Hornet'' was seriously damaged, and ''Jackal'' had lost her mainmast, but the appearance of Allied reinforcements had driven the Austrians back to Cattaro (now [[Kotor]] in [[Montenegro]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/fadri.htm|title=French Naval Operations, Engagements and Ship Losses in the Adriatic in World War 1|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stile.coventry.ac.uk/cbs/staff/beech/ahnavy/1918.htm|title=John Beech's Austro-Hungarian Navy Website|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>  The British lost seven killed (including two in ''Jackal'') and twenty-five wounded, while the Austro-Hungarians suffered no hits.  Despite the one-sided casualty figures, two pre-war Royal Navy destroyers had succeeded in driving off five of the latest enemy destroyers.<ref name=BOS/>
