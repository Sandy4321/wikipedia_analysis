The 116th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 28 March 1970. Held annually, it is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  It was won by Cambridge who passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead of Oxford, securing Cambridge's third consecutive victory.  The race was particularly notable for the "unorthodox" steering of the Oxford [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] [[Ashton Calvert]].

In the reserve race, [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Isis, and in the [[Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge were victorious.

The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station,<ref name=burn82/> from which every crew had won since the [[The Boat Race 1961|1961 race]].<ref name=up/>  The race commenced five minutes later than the scheduled 4.35pm start time,<ref name=up/> with Oxford delaying their arrival at the stakeboat.<ref name=proved/>  Cambridge made the better start and took an early lead.<ref name=proved>{{Cite news | first = Jim | last = Railton | title = Calvert may be proved right | work = [[The Times]] | date = 30 March 1970 | page = 10 | issue = 57830}}</ref>  The Light Blues were half-a-length up within a minute, and had doubled that by the time they passed [[Beverley Brook]].  Oxford's [[Stroke (rowing)|stroke]] Lonsdale increased their [[stroke rate|rating]] in an attempt to stay with Cambridge around the long Surrey bend and temporarily succeeded.  Still a length up at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], the Cambridge cox steered wide and Oxford began to close the gap.  At [[Hammersmith Bridge]], Oxford were no more than a length behind, and "unorthodox tactics" employed by Ashton Calvert,<ref name=proved/> the cox, ensured an "exciting tactical battle" followed.<ref name=proved/>  Calvert steered the Dark Blue boat inside the Cambridge line and "made for the Surrey shore" in a manoeuvre which Donald Legget,<ref name= again/> writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' described as "the most extraordinary sight I have ever witnessed while rowing or coaching".<ref name= again>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge again | first = Donald | last= Legget| work = [[The Observer]] | date =29 March 1970 | page = 20}}</ref> Ignoring the umpire's warnings, Calvert continued on this path for two minutes before returning to the Middlesex side of the river.<ref name=again/>  Despite remaining stroke for stroke, at [[Chiswick Eyot]] Cambridge pushed away and held a lead of nine seconds by Chiswick Steps.  The lead had increased by two seconds at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] and Cambridge passed the finishing post eleven seconds ahead.<ref name=proved/>  Cambridge won by three-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 22 seconds.<ref name=burn82/>

In the reserve race, Cambridge's Goldie beat Oxford's Isis by fourteen lengths, a record distance, in their fourth consecutive victory.<ref name="results"/> In the 25th running of the [[Henley Boat Races#Women's Boat Race|Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge triumphed, their eighth consecutive victory.<ref name=results/>

==Reaction==
Calvert stated after the race: "I could see it was murder in those waves&nbsp;... I decided to try to panic Cambridge by close contact steering, breaking their rhythm and attacking when the stations levelled out beyond Chiswick Steps."<ref name=proved/>  Opinion was divided on Calvert's tactics: ''The Observer'''s Legget claimed that Calvert "adopted quite the wrong tactics",<ref name=again/> while Jim Railton of ''The Times'' suggested "Calvert's move may well prove to be the future tactics of other crews behind but in contact at Hammersmith Bridge on the Middlesex station in similar conditions."<ref name=proved/>  He went on to say "Calvert's tactics nearly paid off and in the circumstances I consider he was justified in his actions."<ref name=proved/> John Rodda of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described Calvert's steering as "zig-zag" and while acknowledging the "bold imagination" involved, claimed the cox's manoeuvres were "futile".<ref name=futile>{{Cite news | title = Calvert move futile| work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 30 March 1970 | page = 13 | first = John |last = Rodda}}</ref>
