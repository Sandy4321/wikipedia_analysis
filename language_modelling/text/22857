The '''Moeraki Boulders''' are unusually large and spherical boulders lying along a stretch of Koekohe Beach on the wave-cut [[Otago]] coast of [[New Zealand]] between Moeraki and [[Hampden, New Zealand|Hampden]]. They occur scattered either as isolated or clusters of boulders within a stretch of beach where they have been protected in a scientific reserve.  The erosion by wave action of [[mudstone]], comprising local bedrock and landslides, frequently exposes embedded isolated boulders. These boulders are grey-colored [[concretions|septarian concretions]], which have been exhumed from the mudstone enclosing them and concentrated on the beach by coastal erosion.<ref name="BolesLandisDale">Boles, J.R., C.A.

Local [[M<U+0101>ori people|M<U+0101>ori]] legends explained the boulders as the remains of eel baskets, [[calabash]]es, and [[Sweet potato|kumara]] washed ashore from the wreck of [[Arai-te-uru]], a large sailing canoe. This legend tells of the rocky shoals that extend seaward from Shag Point as being the petrified hull of this wreck and a nearby rocky promontory as being the body of the canoe's captain. In 1848 W.B.D. Mantell sketched the beach and its boulders, more numerous than now. The picture is now in the [[Alexander Turnbull Library]] in Wellington.<ref name="DannPeat">Dann, C. and N.

== Physical character ==
[[Image:South Island Tour 382.jpg|thumb|right|A cluster of highly spherical boulders]]
The most striking aspect of the boulders is their unusually large size and spherical shape, with a distinct bimodal size distribution. Approximately one-third of the boulders range in size from about {{convert|0.5|to|1.0|m|ft}} in diameter, the other two-thirds from {{convert|1.5|to|2.2|m|ft}}, mostly spherical or almost spherical.  A small proportion of them are not spherical; being slightly elongated parallel to the bedding of the mudstone that once enclosed them.<ref name="BolesLandisDale"/><ref name="ForsythCoates"/><ref name="ThyneBoles"/>

Neither the spherical to subspherical shape or large size of the Moeraki Boulders is unique to them.  Virtually identical spherical boulders, called "Koutu Boulders", are found on the beaches, in the cliffs, and beneath the surface inland of the shore of [[Hokianga Harbour]], [[North Island]], New Zealand, between Koutu and Kauwhare points.  Like the Moeraki Boulders, the almost spherical Koutu Boulders are as large as {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in diameter.

Similar boulder-size concretions, known as "Katiki Boulders", are found on the north-facing shore of Shag Point some {{convert|19|km}} south of where the Moeraki Boulders are found. These concretions occur as both spherical cannonball concretions and flat, disk-shaped or oval concretions. Unlike the Moeraki boulders, some of these concretions contain the bones of [[mosasaur]]s and [[plesiosaur]]s.<ref name="ForsythCoates"/>

Large spherical [[concretion]]s, similar in size and shape to the Moeraki Boulders have been found elsewhere in the world. For example, large spherical concretions as large as {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in diameter are along the [[Cannonball River]] within Morton and Sioux Counties, [[North Dakota]]. Large spherical concretions as much as {{convert|4|to|6|m|ft}} in diameter occur within [[sandstone]] outcrops of the Frontier Formation in northeast [[Utah]] and central [[Wyoming]]. Similar somewhat weathered and eroded giant spheroidal concretions, as large as {{convert|6|m|ft}} in diameter, are at [[Rock City, Kansas|Rock City]] in [[Ottawa County, Kansas]]. Smaller spherical concretions are found on the shore of [[Lake Huron]] near [[Kettle Point, Ontario]], where they are known as "kettles".

== Composition ==
[[Image:Moeraki-boulder-split b.jpg|thumb|250px|A boulder, showing the hollow interior]]
As determined by detailed analysis of the fine-grained rock using [[optical mineralogy]], [[X-ray crystallography]], and [[electron microprobe]], the boulders consist of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented by [[calcite]]. The degree of cementation varies from being relatively weak within the interior of a boulder to quite hard within its outside rim. The outside rims of the larger boulders consist of as much as 10 to 20% calcite, because the calcite not only tightly cements the silt and clay but has also replaced it to a significant degree.<ref name="BolesLandisDale"/><ref name="ThyneBoles"/>

The rock comprising the bulk of a boulder is riddled with large cracks called "septaria" that radiate outward from a hollow core lined with scalenohedral calcite crystals. The process or processes that created septaria within Moeraki Boulders, and in other septarian concretions, remain an unresolved matter for which a number of possible explanations have been proposed. These cracks radiate and thin outward from the centre of the typical boulder and are typically filled with an outer (early stage) layer of brown calcite and an inner (late stage) layer of yellow calcite spar, which often, but not always, completely fills the cracks. Rare Moeraki Boulders have a very thin innermost (latest stage) layer of [[dolomite]] and [[quartz]] covering the yellow calcite spar.<ref name="BolesLandisDale"/><ref name="ForsythCoates"/><ref name="ThyneBoles"/>

The composition of the Moeraki Boulders and the septaria that they contain are typical of, often virtually identical to, septarian [[concretions]] that have been found in exposures of [[sedimentary]] rocks in New Zealand and elsewhere. Pearson and Nelson (2005, 2006) describe in detail the occurrence of smaller but otherwise very similar septarian concretions within exposures of sedimentary rocks elsewhere in New Zealand. Similar septarian concretions have been found in the [[Kimmeridge Clay]] and [[Oxford Clay]] of [[England]], and at many other locations worldwide.<ref name="Scotchman">Scotchman, I.C., 1991, ''The geochemistry of concretions from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of southern and eastern England'', Sedimentology. v. 38, p. 79-106.</ref><ref name="HudColeBarHol">Hudson, J.D., M.L.

Hollingworth, 2001, ''Septarian concretions from the Oxford Clay (Jurassic, England, UK): involvement of original marine and multiple external pore fluids'', Sedimentology. v. 48, p. 507-531.</ref>

== Origin ==
The Moeraki Boulders are [[concretions]] created by the cementation of the [[Paleocene]] mudstone of the [[Moeraki]] Formation, from which they have been exhumed by coastal erosion.

The main body of the boulders started forming in what was then marine mud, near the surface of the Paleocene sea floor. This is demonstrated by studies of their composition; specifically the magnesium and iron content, and stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon. Their spherical shape indicates that the source of calcium was mass diffusion, as opposed to fluid flow.

The larger boulders, {{convert|2|m|ft}} in diameter, are estimated to have taken 4 to 5.5 million years to grow while {{convert|10|to|50|m|ft}} of marine mud accumulated on the seafloor above them. After the concretions formed, large cracks known as ''septaria'' formed in them. Brown calcite, yellow calcite, and small amounts of dolomite and quartz progressively filled these cracks when a drop in sea level allowed fresh groundwater to flow through the mudstone enclosing them.<ref name="BolesLandisDale"/><ref name="ForsythCoates"/><ref name="ThyneBoles"/><ref name="PearsonNelson2005">Pearson, M.J., and C.S.
