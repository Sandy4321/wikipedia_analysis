==Biography==
Sadlowski was born in St. Paul, Alberta in July 1988, the son of a highway-repair man.<ref name="GC"/>As a youth, Sadlowski was a keen ice hockey player and competed for three years in the [[Alberta Junior League]].<ref name="GC"/>His very active participation as a child in hockey and in badminton and other sports developed fast-twitch muscle fibers in Sadlowski's left side (very important in the ability to drive long distances), while strengthening his wrists.<ref name="GC"/>He first entered a long drive competion in [[Edmonton]] at the age of 14, and claims to have been able to hit a ball over 400 yards at just 16.<ref name="LDC"/>His father refers to him as a "super freak".<ref name="GC"/>

Sadlowski has defeated rival and distance record holder [[Mike Dobbyn]] several times in the World Long Drive Championships finals in 2008 and 2009 but unlike Dobbyn is of average height and slight of build at 5'10" and 168 pounds.<ref name="LDC">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTSETsi-OFs|title=Long Drive Contest|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> He won $250,000 for winning his first world title in 2008, and $150,000 for defending it in 2009 during the economic difficulties.<ref name="GC"/>As of 2011 he has a personal best [[drive (golf)|drive]] of 445 yards.<ref name="LDC"/><ref name="JS">{{cite web|url=http://jamiesadlowski.net/aboutjamie.php|title=About Jamie|publisher=jamiesadlowski.net|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> He won the 2008 finals with a drive of 418 yards, hitting 434 yards in an earlier round.<ref name="GD">{{cite web|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/2010-04/jamie-sadlowski-swing|title=How does this guy bomb it?|publisher=[[Golf Digest]]|accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="GC">{{cite web|url=http://www.golf.com/golf/tours_news/article/0,28136,2022838,00.html|title=Super Freak: The longest hitter in history|publisher=[[Golf.com]]|accesdate=15 July 2011}}</ref>He reached the semi finals in the 2010 championships but lost to eventual champion, England<U+2019>s [[Joe Miller]], with a best of 388 yards as compared to Miller's 396.<ref name="JS"/>

In 2010 he won the LDA<U+2019>s Texas Shootout and finished third place at LDA<U+2019>s Mile High Shootout. He also competed in a charity competition at the [[Hyundai Tournament of Champions]] in Hawaii which included professional golfers [[Bubba Watson]], [[Dustin Johnson]] and [[Robert Garrigus]].<ref name="LDC"/>He faced Watson in the final and won easily with a drive of 407 yards, compared to Watson's biggest drive of 347 yards (370 at best in earlier rounds).<ref name="LDC"/>He has competed in over hundred long driving events.<ref name="JS"/>

Sadlowski is naturally left-handed and is able to drive some 300 yards using a left-handed club but is more able playing right-handed. It was in 2010 that he set his personal best of 445 yards and averaged 405 yards.<ref name="JS"/> He has also achieved several other impressive feats with other clubs, with his records as of 2010 being 350 yards with a 14 degree hybrid, 300 yards with a 3-iron, 260 yards with a 5- iron, 240 yards with a 7-iron, 180 yards with a pitching wedge and 300 yards with a putter.<ref name="GC"/>As of 2011 he resides in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].

==Driving mechanics==
Sadlowski is able to generate such massive lengths far beyond those of some of the more powerfully built professional golfers because of his unique flexibility and leanness of build, remarking, "Because I'm lean, I can get in positions other long drivers can't."<ref name="GD"/> Motion Golf, a company that creates sophisticated 3-D swing animations of players, has deduced that in his swing he rotates his shoulders 166 degrees, but his hips move only 49 degrees; [[Tiger Woods]] averages around 85 degrees in comparison. He claims that the secret behind his usually long drive is because of his intensive cardio work out and flexibility exercises in the gym and to "Think swing fast, not hard."<ref name="GC"/><ref name="GD"/>"Golf for Dummies" said of his swing, "at the top of Jamie Sadlowski's much longer swing, his hands are at 12 o'clock, and the clubhead is approaching 5 o'clock".<ref name="McCord2011">{{cite book|last=McCord|first=Gary|title=Golf For Dummies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mtuM0WKanOoC&pg=PT118|accessdate=15 July 2011|date=8 February 2011|publisher=For Dummies|isbn=9781118027301|page=118}}</ref>
