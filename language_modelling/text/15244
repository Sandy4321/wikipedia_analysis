'''Richard''' (d. 1184) was a medieval [[Benedictine]] monk and [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Employed by [[Thomas Becket]] immediately before Becket's death, Richard arranged for Becket to be buried in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election. Much of Richard's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with [[Roger de Pont L'Ev<U+00EA>que|Roger, archbishop of York]] over the primacy of England, and with [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in Canterbury over the archbishops jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard enjoyed better relations with King [[Henry II of England]] than Becket had, and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs. Richard also enjoyed the trust of the papacy, and served as a judge for the papacy. Several of his questions to [[Pope Alexander III]] were collected into the ''[[Decretals]]'', a collection of ecclesiastical laws, and his patronage of canon lawyers did much to advance the study of canon law in England.

==Archbishop==
In 1173, more than two years after the murder of Becket, King [[Henry II of England]] decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. On [[June 3]] [[1173]]<ref name=Handbook232>{{cite book |author=Fryde, E. B. |coauthors=Greenway, D. E.; Porter, S.; Roy, I. |title=Handbook of British Chronology|edition=Third Edition, revised |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-56350-X |pages=p. 232}}</ref> Richard was chosen, although Odo was the nominee of the monks. Objections were raised against the election both in England and in [[Rome]], and Richard journeyed to Rome with [[Reginald fitz Jocelin]], who had recently been elected [[Bishop of Bath]], to rebutt the charges of [[simony]], [[illegitimate birth]], and swearing an oath to the king.  After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on [[April 2]] [[1174]] and on [[April 7]] [[1174]] the new archbishop was consecrated at [[Anagni]] by [[Pope Alexander III]].<ref name=DNB>Duggan, Charles "Richard (d. 1184)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23514 Online Edition] accessed [[November 8]], [[2007]]</ref> Richard returned to England at the close of the year bearing his [[pallium]] which he had received directly from the pope.<ref name=Lawrence73>Duggan, Charles "From the Conquest to the Death of John" in Lawrence, C.

The ten years during which Richard was archbishop were disturbed by disputes with [[Roger de Pont L'Ev<U+00EA>que|Roger]], [[archbishop of York]], over the respective rights of the two [[episcopal see|sees]], and in 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their partisans. King Henry II arranged a truce for five years between the rival [[prelate]]s, but Richard was soon involved in another quarrel, this one with Roger, abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in Canterbury. The dispute involved whether or not the abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had jurisdictional rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement that left the abbey dependant on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of [[Thanet]], which had previously been held by the abbey.<ref name=Monastic588>[[David Knowles|Knowles, Dom David]] ''The Monastic Order in England: From the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council'' Second Edition Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1976 reprint ISBN 0-521-05479-6 p. 588</ref>

Richard was more acceptable to Henry II than Becket had been; Richard attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in [[Normandy]]. Henry probably preferred Richard because he insisted less on the rights of the [[clergy]] than his great predecessor had done; but the [[monastic]] writers and the followers of Becket regarded this attitude as a sign of weakness.<ref name=Warren536>Warren, W.

Richard also spent part of 1177 in [[Flanders]] on diplomatic business for King Henry.<ref name=DNB/>

==Patronage, death and legacy==
Richard attracted [[canon lawyer]]s to his household, including [[Gerard la Pucelle]], [[Peter of Blois]], and Henry Pium of Northampton, all of whom advised him on legal matters. At the [[Synods of Westminster|Council of Westminster]] that Richard convened in May 1175, nineteen [[Canon law|canons]] were put forth, dealing with clerical marriage, the oversupply of ordained clergy, the behaviour of the clergy and their dress and [[tonsure]], and simony. Another canon dealt with clandestine marriages and regulated child marriages. He was also heavily involved with trying judicial cases, both in the actual judgment as well as in the execution of judgments made by others. Four of his questions to Alexander III entered the ''Decretals'' and the other collections of canon law of the 13th century.<ref name=DNB/>

Richard died at [[Halling, Kent]]<ref name=DNB/> on [[February 16]] [[1184]]<ref name=Handbook232/> of colic and was buried in his cathedral.<ref name=DNB/> [[Austin Lane Poole|A. L. Poole]], the historian, felt that Richard was a "feeble and ineffective person."<ref name=Poole221>[[Austin Lane Poole|Poole, A.
