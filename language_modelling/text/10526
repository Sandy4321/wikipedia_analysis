Argyle is part of [[Red Line (CTA)|CTA's Red Line]], which runs from Howard to downtown Chicago and 95th Street.

It serves the Red Line's two tracks; the north-bound track serves trains to Howard, while the south-bound track serves trains to 95th Street. The station entrance is located on the north side of Argyle Street, built into the embankment. It is situated between the Berwyn and Lawrence stations. Red Line trains serve Argyle 24 hours a day every day; trains operate roughly every 3 to 9 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, with longer headways of up to 15 minutes at night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/systemguide/redline.aspx |title=Red Line Route Guide |author= |work= |publisher=[[Chicago Transit Authority]] |accessdate=July 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100722124824/http://www.transitchicago.com/riding_cta/systemguide/redline.aspx| archivedate= 22 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=argyle_timetable>{{cite web |url=http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/redline_schedules/Argyle.pdf |title=Argyle Station Timetable |author= |work= |publisher=[[Chicago Transit Authority]] |accessdate=July 29, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100730202902/http://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/redline_schedules/Argyle.pdf| archivedate= 30 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The station is also located {{frac|2}} a block from the #36 Broadway bus.
