The '''Hillsgrove Covered Bridge''' is a [[Burr Truss|Burr arch truss]] [[covered bridge]] over [[Loyalsock Creek]] in [[Hillsgrove Township, Pennsylvania|Hillsgrove Township]], [[Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Sullivan County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. It was built ''circa'' 1850 and is {{convert|186|ft|1}} long. In 1973, it became the first covered bridge in the county to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The bridge is named for the township and nearby [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[village]] of Hillsgrove, and is also known as Rinkers Covered Bridge for an adjoining farm.

Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States, and has had the most such bridges since the 19th century. They were a transition between stone and metal bridges, with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from the weather. The Hillsgrove bridge has [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] Burr [[arch]]es sandwiching multiple vertical [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]] on each side, for strength and rigidity. It was built by Sadler Rodgers, who also constructed the nearby [[Forksville Covered Bridge]] in the same year, with a similar design. 

The Hillsgrove bridge is the longest of three covered bridges remaining in Sullivan County, and served as a landing site for lumber rafts on the creek between 1870 and 1890. Nineteenth-century regulations restricting speed, number of animals, and fire are still posted on the bridge. Restoration work was carried out in 1963, 1968 and 2001, and the bridge is still in use, with average daily traffic of 54 vehicles in 2006. Despite these restorations, as of 2006 the [[National Bridge Inventory]] found it to be "Functionally Obsolete", with problematic foundations and railings, and a 16.5&nbsp;percent structural sufficiency rating.<ref name="national bridges"/> 

==Overview==
The covered bridge is in Hillsgrove Township on Covered Bridge Road (Township Road 357), which is {{convert|0.1|mi}} north of [[Pennsylvania Route 87]] via Splash Dam Road (TR 359). The bridge crosses Loyalsock Creek northeast and upstream of the unincorporated village of Hillsgrove, and is just south of [[Elkland Township, Pennsylvania|Elkland Township]].<ref name ="evans"/><ref>{{cite map |scale = 1:65,000| publisher= Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Planning and Research, Geographic Information Division   | url= ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/GHS/Roadnames/sullivan_GHSN.PDF   | title= 2007&nbsp;General Highway Map Sullivan County Pennsylvania  | accessdate= 2008-06-06}}</ref> Its official name on the NRHP is ''Hillsgrove Covered Bridge''.<ref name="arch"/><ref name="register">{{cite web

The village of Hillsgrove is where Daniel Ogden became the first settler in what is now Sullivan County, ''circa'' 1786. John Hill, who founded and named the village of Hill's Grove (later just Hillsgrove), came to the area in 1789 and bought Ogden's land about 1794. Sullivan County was formed from part of [[Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Lycoming County]] on March 14, 1847, and the bridge was built in 1850. The division of Lycoming County ran through [[Plunketts Creek Township, Pennsylvania|Plunketts Creek Township]], so there were initially townships of this name in each of the adjoining counties. To avoid confusion, the name of the Sullivan County township was changed to Hillsgrove Township in 1856; the new township name was taken from the village of Hillsgrove, which was (and is) its largest settlement.<ref name="sullivan history">{{cite book| url= http://www.rootsweb.com/~pasulliv/sullivancountyfolk/scf2/streby/Ingham.htm |title= History of Sullivan County, Pennsylvania: Compendium of Biography |author = Thomas J.

This stood from 1876 until 1934, when it was [[wiktionary:condemn|condemned]] and replaced by a steel and concrete structure. It was the third covered bridge on the site: the first fell into the creek, and the second was torn down to make way for the third bridge.<ref name = "souvenir"/>

==History==
===Background===
The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the [[Schuylkill River]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. According to Susan M. Zacher, author of ''The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania: A Guide'', the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state. Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1,500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875.<ref name = "three counties">{{cite web | url = http://www.nr.nps.gov/multiples/64000708.pdf | title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties | accessdate = 2008-04-14 | author = Susan M. Zacher, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission | format = PDF }}</ref> In 2001, Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state; 221 remained in 40 of its 67 counties.<ref name = "evans intro">{{cite book |title = Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide |first = Benjamin D. |last = Evans |coauthor = Evans, June R. | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press |location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-8229-5764-7 |date = 2001 |edition =2nd edition | pages = pp. 2, 7, 12}}</ref> 

Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges, the latter made of cast-iron or steel. In 19th-century Pennsylvania, lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction,<ref name = "three counties"/> but did not last long when exposed to the elements. The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements, allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century. A Burr arch truss consists of a [[Structural engineering|load-bearing]] [[arch]] sandwiching multiple [[Truss#King_post_truss|king posts]], resulting in stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone.<ref name = "evans intro"/> Although there were 30&nbsp;covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890, only five were left by 1954, and as of 2008 only three remain: [[Forksville Covered Bridge|Forksville]], Hillsgrove, and [[Sonestown Covered Bridge|Sonestown]].<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans 3">{{cite book |title = Pennsylvania's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide |first = Benjamin D. |last = Evans |coauthor = Evans, June R. | publisher = University of Pittsburgh Press |location = Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-8229-5764-7 |date = 2001 |edition =2nd edition | pages = pp. 257&ndash;259}}</ref> 

===Construction and description===
All three Sullivan County covered bridges were built in or ''circa'' 1850 with Burr arch trusses.<ref name = "arch"/><ref name = "evans 3"/> The Hillsgrove bridge was built for Sullivan County by Sadler Rogers (or Rodgers), a native of Forksville who was only 18 years old at the time.

On July 2, 1973, the Hillsgrove bridge was the first covered bridge in Sullivan County to be added to the NRHP, and on July 24, 1980 it was again included on the NRHP in a [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places#Multiple_Property_Submission|Multiple Property Submission]] of seven [[Covered Bridges of Bradford, Sullivan and Lycoming Counties]].<ref name = "three counties"/> The Hillsgrove bridge is on the 2006&nbsp;National Bridge Inventory (NBI), which lists the covered bridge as {{convert|186|ft|m}} long, with a roadway {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}} wide, and a maximum load of {{convert|5.0|ST|MT|1|lk=on}}.<ref name="national bridges"/> However, the maximum load posted on the bridge itself is only {{convert|3.0|ST|MT|1}}. According to the NRHP, the bridge's "road surface width" is {{convert|18|ft|1}},<ref name="arch"/> which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic.<ref name="national bridges"/> 

As of 2008, each portal has a sign with the posted clearance height of {{convert|8|ft|1}}, and the west portal also has a "No Trucks Allowed" sign hanging below this. A sign posted on the east portal above the clearance preserves the following 19th-century limits on its use: "Notice: All persons are forbidden to ride drive or lead any animal over this bridge faster than a walk or to drive more than 15 head of cattle horses or mules thereon at one time or to carry fire thereon except in a safe vessel under a penalty of not less than $.30 for each offence."<ref name="three"/><ref>Note: Follow these links for photographs of the [[:Image:Hillsgrove Covered Bridge Sign.jpg|east portal]] and [[:Image:Hillsgrove Covered Bridge Portal and Side.jpg|west portal]].</ref>

[[Image:Hillsgrove Covered Bridge Portal and Side.jpg|thumb|West portal and south side of the bridge, showing the sharp turn to enter on this side]]
The covered bridge rests on [[abutment]]s of stone and mortar, which have been reinforced with concrete. There are no parapets.<ref name= "evans"/> The bridge deck is made of crosswise "narrow width laid flooring".<ref name = "zacher"/> Wheel guards on the deck separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkways on either side and protect the sides, which are covered with "vertical board and batten siding" almost to the [[eaves]].<ref name = "evans"/> As of 2008, the sides are unpainted, but the portals are painted red. The bridge has long, narrow windows with wooden shutters: the south side has three windows, and the north side has two. An opening between the eaves and the siding runs the length of the bridge on both sides.  The gable roof is [[sheet metal]] which has been installed over the original wooden [[Shake (shingle)|shake shingles]]. The bridge is supported by a Burr arch truss, and is similar in design and construction to the one in Forksville.<ref name = "evans"/> The western end of the Hillsgrove bridge lies against a steep hillside,<ref name = "zacher"/> and those approaching the bridge from the west must make a sharp right turn to enter it.<ref name ="three"/>

Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century. Two of the five bridges that remained in 1954 were razed by 1970, when the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] considered tearing down the Forksville bridge (but renovated it because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists).<ref name="grit"/> The Hillsgrove Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1973 and the two other bridges were added in 1980. The [[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] now forbids the destruction of any covered bridge on the NRHP in the state and has to approve any renovation work.<ref name = "phmc">{{cite news |first= Nancy E. |last= Baumgartner |title= Cogan House Covered Bridge Dedication Follows Facelift |publisher= ''[[Williamsport Sun-Gazette]]'' |date= November 1, 1998 }} </ref>

===Use and restoration===
In the 19th century the Hillsgrove Covered Bridge survived major floods on March&nbsp;1, 1865, and June&nbsp;1, 1889, that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley.<ref name="history 1">

Covered Bridge Road north of Loyalsock Creek is accessed only by the Hillsgrove Covered Bridge at the eastern end, and a bridge over Elk Creek at the western end. Sullivan County replaced the bridge over Elk Creek between March 21 and July 21, 1989. Without the Elk Creek bridge, access for five families, a business, and a [[Little League Baseball]] camp with 110 children was limited to the covered bridge. County officials noted that despite the covered bridge's posted weight limit of {{convert|2.0|ST|MT|1}}, it could still support {{convert|5.0|ST|MT|1}}, sufficient for small fire trucks and ambulances. In an emergency, larger emergency vehicles could [[ford (crossing)|ford]] the creek if needed. In any case, the limited access did not cause any problems for the four-month period while the Elk Creek bridge was replaced.<ref>{{cite news |title= Officials Fret Over Bridge Removal: Lack of Access Concerns Firemen |publisher= ''Williamsport Sun-Gazette'' |date= April 5, 1989 }}</ref> 

The Evans' book describes repairs to the siding on the northeast of the bridge, done between 1991 and 2000.<ref name = "evans"/> In 2001, the [[US Department of Transportation]] [[Federal Highway Administration]] awarded $360,000 for 80&nbsp;percent of the restoration costs of the Hillsgrove bridge under the Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Program.

Despite the restorations and repairs, the 2006 [[Federal Highway Administration]] [[National Bridge Inventory]] found the bridge to be "Functionally Obsolete".<ref name = "national bridges"/> In addition, the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure was 16.5&nbsp;percent,{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} the foundations were "unstable for calculated scour conditions ", and the railing did not meet "currently acceptable standards".<ref name="national bridges"/> Its overall condition was deemed "basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action", and the estimated cost to improve the bridge was $108,000.<ref name="national bridges"/> The bridge is still used, and its average daily traffic was 54 vehicles in 2006.<ref name="national bridges"/> According to Zacher, the "Sullivan County bridges, because of their settings, are some of the most attractive in the state".<ref name="zacher"/>
