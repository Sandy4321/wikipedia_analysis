Use of the term ''kibi dango'' in the first sense occurs at least as early as the {{Nihongo||<U+300E><U+5C71><U+79D1><U+5BB6><U+793C><U+8A18><U+300F>|Yamashinake raiki|"Diary of the Yamashina Family"}}, in an entry dated 1488 ([[Ch<U+014D>ky<U+014D>]] 2, 3rd month, 19th day) which mentions "kibi dango."<ref name="yamashina-raiki">{{citation|editor-last=<U+98EF><U+5009>|editor-first=<U+6674><U+6B66>|editor-link=<U+98EF><U+5009><U+6674><U+6B66>|title=<U+5C71><U+79D1><U+5BB6><U+79AE><U+8A18><U+7B2C> 4|publisher=<U+7D9A><U+7FA4><U+66F8><U+985E><U+5F93><U+5B8C><U+6210><U+4F1A>|origyear=1972|year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jaPTAAAAMAAJ|series=<U+53F2><U+6599><U+7E82><U+96C6>|volume=22|page=}}</ref><ref><U+300E>[[<U+65E5><U+672C><U+56FD><U+8A9E><U+5927><U+8F9E><U+5178>]]<U+300F>, entry under "<U+304D><U+3073><U+2010><U+3060><U+3093><U+3054> (kibi-dango)"</ref>

===Kibitsu Shrine===
The [[Kibitsu Shrine]] of the former [[Kibi Province]] has an early connection to the millet dumpling, due to the easy pun on the geographic name "Kibi". The pun is attested in one [[waka]] poem and one [[haiku]] dating to the early 17th century, brought to attention by poet and scholar {{ill2|Shida Giy<U+016B>|ja|<U+5FD7><U+7530><U+7FA9><U+79C0>}} in a treatise written in 1941.<ref name="shida">{{citation|last=<U+5FD7><U+7530>|first=<U+7FA9><U+79C0> (Shida, Gish<U+016B>)|chapter=<U+4E0B><U+7BC7> 2 <U+6843><U+592A><U+90DE><U+69EA><U+8AD6> (''Nihon no densetsu to d<U+014D>wa', "Japanese legends and fairy tales")|title=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+306E><U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+3068><U+7AE5><U+8A71>|publisher=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+306E><U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+3068><U+7AE5><U+8A71>|year=1941|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1453466|pages=303<U+2013>315}}</ref><ref name="fujii"/>

The first example, a satirical {{ill2|ky<U+014D>ka{{!}}''ky<U+014D>ka''|ja|<U+72C2><U+6B4C>}} composed at the shrine by the [[daimyo|feudal lord]] [[Hosokawa Fujitaka|Hosokawa Y<U+016B>sai]] (d. 1610), translates to "As ''kine'' ([[double entendre]] meaning either [[miko]] priestess or a [[mallet]]) is traditional to godhood, straightaway I would fain see the pounding of Kibitsu (or "Millet's") shrine into dumplings."<ref group="lower-alpha"><U+300C><U+795E><U+306F><U+304D><U+306D><U+304C><U+306A><U+3089><U+306F><U+3057><U+306A><U+308C><U+3070><U+5148><U+3065><U+6417><U+304D><U+3066><U+56E3><U+5B50><U+306B><U+3057><U+305F><U+304D><U+5409><U+5099><U+6D25><U+5BAE><U+304B><U+306A><U+300D> ''Kami wa kine ga narawashi nareba mazu tsukite dango ni shitaki Kibitsu Miya kana.''

A haiku in similar vein, of somewhat later date and also at the same shrine according to Shida, was composed by an obscure poet named {{Nihongo|Nobumitsu|<U+4FE1><U+5145>}} of [[Bitch<U+016B> Province]]. The haiku reads "Oh, [[mochi]]-like snow, Japan's number one Kibi dango,"<ref group="lower-alpha">In Japanese:<U+300C><U+9905><U+96EA><U+3084><U+65E5><U+672C><U+4E00><U+306E><U+5409><U+5099><U+3060><U+3093><U+3054><U+300D> ''Mochiyuki ya, Nihon ichi no Kibi dango'', from the {{Nihongo||<U+300E><U+5D11><U+5C71><U+96C6><U+300F>|[[Konronsh<U+016B>]]}} of 1651.</ref> The flaunting of the stock phrase from the [[Momotar<U+014D>]] story,<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Polen|first=James Scott|title=Continuity and Change of Momotar<U+014D>|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|year=2008|degree=MA Art|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/10422/1/jspolenthesis.pdf|format=pdf|at=p.39 (endnote 40 to p.30)|quote=Some versions of the folktale explain that [the millet dumplings] were ''nihon'ichi'' (Japan's best)}},</ref> constituted "immovable" proof of an early Momotar<U+014D> connection in Shida's estimation, but his underlying convinction that "Japan's number one kibi dango" was ever-present since the earliest inception of the Momotar<U+014D> legend has been compromised by the efforts of {{ill2|Koike T<U+014D>gor<U+014D>|ja|<U+5C0F><U+6C60><U+85E4><U+4E94><U+90CE>}}, who after examining Edo-period texts of Momotar<U+014D> concluded that "Japan's number one" or even "millet dumpling" had not appeared in the tale until decades after this haiku.<ref name="koike-momotaro-dates">{{cite journal|last=<U+5C0F><U+6C60>|first=<U+85E4><U+4E94><U+90CE>|title=<U+53E4><U+6587><U+732E><U+3092><U+57FA><U+790E><U+3068><U+3057><U+305F> <U+6843><U+592A><U+90CE><U+8AAC><U+8A71><U+306E><U+7814><U+7A76>(<U+4E0A>) [A Study of "Momotaro" : Based on Old Literature]|journal=Journal of the Faculty of Letters, Rissh<U+014D> University (<U+7ACB><U+6B63><U+5927><U+5B66><U+6587><U+5B66><U+90E8><U+8AD6><U+53E2>)|volume=<U+7B2C> 26<U+53F7>|year=1967|pages=3-39 (pp. 21, 30-31)|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110000477022.pdf?id=ART0000862795&no=1400482742|issn=0485215X}}</ref><ref group="lower-alpha" name="shimazu">Koike was actually refuting {{ill2|Shimazu Hisamoto|ja|<U+5CF6><U+6D25><U+4E45><U+57FA>}}, who likewise considered the "Japan's number one" phrase proof positive of the antiquity of the Momotar<U+014D> tale.</ref>

If the above appear to be fleeting minutiae, in later years, more elaborate legends were promoted connecting the shrine, or rather its resident deity [[Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto]] to the kibi dango. The founder the K<U+014D>eido authored a travel guide in 1895, in which he claimed that Kibitsuhiko rolled with his own hand some kibi dango to give to [[Emperor Jimmu]] who stopped at Takayama Palace in Okayama,<ref name="asajiro">{{citation|last=<U+6B66><U+7530>|first=<U+6DFA><U+6B21><U+90CE> (Takeda, Asajir<U+014D>)|title=<U+5C71><U+967D><U+540D><U+6240><U+8A18>|publisher=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+306E><U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+3068><U+7AE5><U+8A71>|place=<U+5CA1><U+5C71>|publisher=<U+6B66><U+7530><U+6DFA><U+6B21><U+90CE>|year=1895|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1084841|pages=1&ndash;5, 45}}</ref> but that anecdote was purely anachronistic.<ref group="lower-alpha">Prince Kibitsuhiko in life was an 8th generation descendant and unborn during the time of Jimmu.</ref> Later, an amateur historian wrote a 1930 book proposing that the legend of Kibitsuhiko's ogre-slaying was the source of the "Peach Boy" or Momotar<U+014D> folktale,<ref>Nanba Kinnosuke's ''Momotar<U+014D> no shijitsu'' (1930) {{Harvnb|Kahara|2004|p=44}}</ref> leading to fervent local efforts to localize the hero Momotar<U+014D> to [[Kibi Province]] ([[Okayama Prefecture]]).<ref name="kahara-2004eng-p41">{{Harvnb|Kahara|2004|p=41}}</ref>

===Momotar<U+014D> legend===
In the widely familiar version of Momotar<U+014D>, the hero spares his traveling rations of "kibi dango" to a dog, a pheasant, and a monkey and thereby gains their allegiance. However the scholar [[Koike T<U+014D>gor<U+014D>|Koike]] compared the various [[kusaz<U+014D>shi]] texts and discovered that early written texts of the Momotar<U+014D> legend failed to call the rations "kibi dango". Versions from the [[Genroku]] era (1688&ndash;1704) has {{nihongo||<U+3068><U+3046><U+56E3><U+5B50>([[:ja:<U+5341><U+56E3><U+5B50>|<U+5341><U+56E3><U+5B50>]])|t<U+014D> dango}}, and other tales antedating "kibi dango" have {{nihongo||<U+5927><U+4ECF><U+9905>|daibutsu mochi|extra2="Great Buddha [[mochi]]"}} or  {{nihongo||<U+3044><U+304F><U+3088><U+9905>|ikuyo mochi|}} (named after Ikuyo, a woman of the pleasure quarters) instead. Morerover, the "Japan's number one" brag was unattached to Momotar<U+014D>'s kibi dango until around the [[Genbun]] era (1736) as far as Koike could fathom.<ref name="koike-momotaro-dates"/><ref group="lower-alpha" name="shimazu"/>

===Origins===
The standard curt explanation is that this specialty dessert was first invented by the confectioner {{Nihongo|K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>|<U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802>}} during the early [[Ansei]] era (1854&ndash;).<ref name="nihondaihyakkazensho">{{citation|contribution=<U+5409><U+5099><U+56E3><U+5B50>|work=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+5927><U+767E><U+79D1><U+5168><U+66F8>|publisher=<U+5C0F><U+5B66><U+9928>|year=2001}}</ref> This purveyor later split into two brands, {{Nihongo|K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> Honten|<U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802><U+672C><U+5E97>}} and {{Nihongo|K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>|<U+5E83><U+6804><U+5802><U+6B66><U+7530>}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahara|2004|loc=p.42, note 8}}</ref> which remain to this day. Takeda is the family name of the original business.

There are irreconcilably differing accounts of the dates and sequences of events regarding the invention. The official line version, endorsed by the K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> Honten, is that the family ran a ceramics merchant named "{{nihongo|Hirose-ya|<U+5EE3><U+702C><U+5C4B>}}" for 7 generations running, until it switched business to a confectioner in 1856, changing the name to "K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>". According to this scenario, around 1856,<ref group="lower-alpha">The specified year shifts slightly according to source. Shida ({{Harvnb|<U+5FD7><U+7530>|1941|loc=<U+300E><U+65E5><U+672C><U+306E><U+4F1D><U+8AAC><U+3068><U+7AE5><U+8A71><U+300F> (''Nihon no densetsu to d<U+014D>wa''), p. 312}}) states that according to information given him by K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>, the confection was created around 1853 ([[Kaei]] 6) and dubbed "Kibi dango" around 1855 ([[Ansei]] 2).</ref> Takeda Hanz<U+014D> (<U+534A><U+8535>), the retired predecessor of the family ceramics shop, was one of the three [[Okayama, Okayama|Okayama]] townsmen who collectively devised the new recipe that was somehow an improvement over the steamed [[proso millet|millet]] dumpling "rectangularly shaped like [[kakimochi]], which did not keep well, and was eaten with [[red bean paste]] or flavored liquid (''shiru'') poured on top," that was a common staple wherever the crop was harvested.<ref name="150years">{{cite web|url=http://www.koeido.co.jp/150years_top.html|title=<U+548C><U+83D3><U+5B50> <U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802><U+672C><U+5E97><U+FF1A><U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802><U+306E><U+304D><U+3073><U+3060><U+3093><U+3054>150<U+5E74><U+306E><U+3042><U+3086><U+307F> (Wagashi K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> Honten: 150 year foot-track of the K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> kibi dango)|author=<U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802><U+672C><U+5E97> (Koeido Co., Ltd.)|accessdate=May-2014}}</ref> However, the first proprietor of "K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>" was a man named Takeda Hanz<U+014D> (<U+6D45><U+6B21><U+90CE>), and it is he who is placed in the ca. 1856 event in by some sources. According to these dictionaries, a tea ceremony connoiseur named {{ill2|Igi Tadazumi|ja|<U+4F0A><U+6728><U+5FE0><U+6F84>}}, who was then senior advisor ([[kar<U+014D>]]) to the feudal lord of the local [[Okayama Castle]] ([[Ikeda clan]]) gave Asajir<U+014D> crucial advise leading to the recipe innovation.<ref name="okuyama">e.g. the dictionary, {{citation|editor-last=<U+5965><U+5C71>|editor-first=<U+76CA><U+6717> (Okuyama, Masur<U+014D> )|title=<U+548C><U+83D3><U+5B50><U+306E><U+8F9E><U+5178> (Wagashi no jiten)|publisher=<U+6771><U+4EAC><U+5802><U+51FA><U+7248>|year=1983|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=UQY2AQAAIAAJ|page=112|isbn=4490102615}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kahara|2004|p=41}}, after Oka Ch<U+014D>hei</ref>

The above simplified chronology is seen repeated in a handful of desk references.<ref name="okuyama"/> But more meticulous accounts of what transpired suggest that several years passed between1856 and the time Asajir<U+014D> became successor to this business, changing the recipe. Indeed, Asajir<U+014D> himself wrote that his kibi dango did not change from the rectangular to round shapes until the Meiji Era was ushered in (1868-).<ref name="asajiro"/> And (barring the change happening in the mere first or second year of [[Mutsuhito]]'s reign) Igi Tadazumi's assistance in the recipe could have only happened after he adopted his [[art name]] {{Nihongo|<U+4F0A><U+6728><U+4E09><U+733F><U+658E>|San'ensai}} in his retirement, from 1869 to his death in 1886.

In the year 1855 (Ansei 2) three commoners from the town around [[Okayama Castle]] (now [[Okayama]] City) collaborated and devised a reddish rectangular confection rather like [[kakimochi]] as accompaniment to serving tea. Among the three was {{nihongo|old man Hanro|<U+4F34><U+5442><U+7FC1>}}, resident of Furugy<U+014D>ch<U+014D> and [[Karatsu ware]] peddling agent fronting for the samurai clan (''my<U+014D>dai'').{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|The 2nd man in the group was {{nihongo|Shigaraki S<U+014D>suke|<U+4FE1><U+697D><U+5B97><U+4ECB>}}, a resident of Takasagoch<U+014D> and also a ''my<U+014D>dai'' merchant of [[Shigaraki ware]],<ref name="oka"/> who also sold [[moxa]] of [[Mount Ibuki]] from the same [[<U+014C>mi Province]].<ref name="150years"/><ref name="ichikawa"/> The 3rd man in the party was a resident of Kamiyach<U+014D>, the ''ky<U+014D>ka'' poet {{Nihongo|Sasano Ipp<U+014D>|<U+7B39><U+91CE><U+4E00><U+65B9>}} whose [[art name]] was 'Higenaga'' or "longbeard"<ref name="150years"/><ref name="ichikawa"/>}} This old man Hanro was the grandfather {{nihongo|Takeda Hanz<U+014D>|<U+6B66><U+7530><U+4F34><U+8535>}}, and a member of the Takeda family who later founded K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>. This snack was for pastime purposes only and not meant for business, but since leaving it nameless did not seem fitting, they pondered until they struck up the idea of borrowing the province name and calling it {{nihongo|Kibi-dan-go|<U+5409><U+5099><U+3060><U+3093><U+7C89> (<U+304D><U+3073><U+3060><U+3093><U+7C89>)|extra2="Kibi dan powder"}}, something of a [[nonce word]].

Although this dessert was initially only distributed among friends and family, it was eventually offered for sale and gained popularity. Takeda Hanz<U+014D> (died in 1901 at age 81) then outfitted a shop named {{nihongo|S<U+014D>kand<U+014D>|<U+76F8><U+6B53><U+5802>}} after his own [[art name]], and had his mistress sell the Kibi-dan-go.<ref name="oka"/>{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Oka obtained the intelligence word-of-mouth from {{nihongo||<U+798F><U+7530><U+6885><U+5B50>|Fukuda Umeko}} that this S<U+014D>kand<U+014D> was named after {{nihongo||<U+5341><U+4EE3><U+76EE><U+6B66><U+7530><U+4F34><U+8535><U+79C0><U+6CBB>|Takeda Hanz<U+014D> Hideharu X}} and that it was run by his mistress .<ref name="oka"/>}} Although Oka also heard dissenting reports that this Kibi-dan-go was millet dumpling with a "rather long thin thread of [[red bean paste]] poured over it," he was skeptical, and concluded it was in fact "probably kakimochi".{{Refn|group="lower-alpha"|Oka opined that an (ordinary) dumpling made entirely of millet was neither merchandizable nor suitable as souvenir.

It was not until Takeda Asajir<U+014D>'s takeover that the merchandise became the present-day soft [[gy<U+016B>hi]] product packed in boxes, according to the memory of Nishio Kichitaro<!--<U+897F><U+5C3E><U+5409><U+592A><U+90CE>-->, founder of the {{ill2|Sanyo Shimpo{{!}}''Sany<U+014D> Shimp<U+014D>''|ja|<U+5C71><U+967D><U+65B0><U+5831>}}, for many years the only newspaper of the area.<ref name="oka"/> Asajir<U+014D>'s own book too states that it was only after the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1867-) that his product changed from the rectangular items of the past to the round cakes as large as two [[Go (game)|go]] stones, sold in boxed in sets of 30 or 50.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+6B66><U+7530>|1895|p=3}}</ref>
 
In 1885 (Meiji 18) K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>'s Kibi dango was presented to [[Emperor Meiji]] who was visiting the area, and he wrote a [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poem praising it, which translated to "Kibi dango such that no two such exists in Japan / Indeed such is the taste and it has earned its name, this".

===Alternate origins===
Some researchers have attempted to establish roots that are not quite so dependent on the business, and more to do with the [[Kibitsu Shrine]].

Japanese shrines have a custom called {{nihongo||[[:ja:<U+76F4><U+4F1A>|<U+5FA1><U+76F4><U+4F1A>]]|naorai}} whereby food offerings to the resident deitiy would afterwards be consumed. Kibitsu Shrine observed this custom in the early Edo Period, and this origin the Kibi dango is presented as a rival claim by [[Okayama University]] professor {{ill2|Taniguchi Sumio|ja|<U+8C37><U+53E3><U+6F84><U+592B>}} in his book on the history of the prefecture.<ref name="ichikawa"/><ref name="taniguchi_sumio">{{citation|last=<U+8C37><U+53E3>|first=<U+6F84><U+592B>|others=[[<U+5150><U+7389><U+5E78><U+591A>]] (supervising editor)|title=<U+5CA1><U+5C71><U+770C><U+306E><U+6B74><U+53F2>|publisher=[[<U+5C71><U+5DDD><U+51FA><U+7248><U+793E>]]|year=1970|url=http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=Gv2xAAAAIAAJ|page=64}} ; 1984 edition: Appendix, p.46.</ref>

===Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars===
K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>'s Kibi dango's national fame came after the private [[San'y<U+014D> Railway]] came into operation through its city.<ref name="kahara-2004eng-p42">{{Harvnb|Kahara|2004|p=42}}</ref> This new line connected the [[Kobe]] (which was the [[Terminal train station|terminus]] of the state-run line) to Okayama in 1891, and extended the line to [[Hiroshima]] just before the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1894. Since the Daihonei ([[Imperial General Headquarters]]) was located in Hiroshima, all the troops were amassed here and shipped in and out of {{nihongo|[[Hiroshima Harbor|Ujina Harbor]]|[[<U+5E83><U+5CF6><U+6E2F>|<U+5B87><U+54C1><U+6E2F>]]}} (Hiroshima Harbor). Those residing farther east and serving the war by necessity rode the San'y<U+014D> line, and passed the Okayama station in transit. K<U+014D>eid<U+014D>, which been peddling their goods in [[Okayama Station]] now expanded business to the [[Hiroshima Station]], and capitlizez on on the soldiers and send-off parties buying the Kibi dango as souvenirs.<ref name="150years"/><ref name="kahara-2004eng-p42"/>

It was at this time that K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> began its marketing strategy connecting its product to "Peach Boy". Reputedly, proprietor Takeda Asajir<U+014D> himself dressed up as Momotar<U+014D> and held up the "Nippon-ichi (number one in Japan)" banner to pitch sales,<ref name="150years"/><ref name="kahara-2004eng-p42"/> and persons dressed up as [[oni]] ogre handed out leaflets.<ref name="oka"/> The peddling at the station was so successful, that a lady from Yamawaki (Sangetsud<U+014D>), who also had Takeda Hanz<U+014D> connections, was recruited to help.<ref name="oka"/> By April 1897 (Meiji 30), there were 12 establishments that billed themselves as the "original" (''honbo'', '''honke'', 'ganso'') Kibi dango sellers.<ref name="ichikawa"/><ref>{{Harvnb|<U+5CA1>|1986|pp=144}}, tally according to the ''Sany<U+014D> Shimp<U+014D>'' newspaper.</ref>

A 1901 article by folk historian {{nihongo|Mizunoya Takashige [?]|<U+6C34><U+306E><U+5BB6><U+9686><U+6210>}} stated that while"K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> used millet, [[mochi]], and sugar as ingredients, Sangetsud<U+014D> used mochi and sugar," and that Sangetsud<U+014D> stressed the fact they did not use millet and was different item than "Japan's number one kibi dango."<ref name="oka"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=<U+6C34><U+5EFC><U+5BB6>|first=<U+9686><U+6210>|title=<U+65E5><U+672C><U+4E00><U+306E><U+5409><U+5099><U+56E3><U+5B50> (Nihon'ichi no kibidango)|journal=<U+98A8><U+4FD7><U+753B><U+5831>|volume=238|year=1901}}</ref>

===Modern age===
As already described, during the Meiji Era, the Kibi dango business had already appropriated the "number one" slogan<ref name="asajiro"/> from the  Peach Boy folktale, and was using the hero's costume to promote sales.<ref name="kahara-2004eng-p42"/> But eventually, the entire Okayama prefecture began to promote the Kibi dango and Momotar<U+014D> as inextricably connected part of their prefectural heritage.

Nowadays, the Momotar<U+014D> theme is used in train station advertisement, as well as being found in packaging of the kibi dango products. Since 1993, the K<U+014D>eid<U+014D> Honten has sold the "Ganso Kibidango", featuring Momotar<U+014D> character design by children's book illustrator [[Tar<U+014D> Gomi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koeido.co.jp/company_history.html|title=<U+6CBF><U+9769> (history)|author=<U+5EE3><U+69AE><U+5802><U+672C><U+5E97> (Koeido Co., Ltd.)|accessdate=May-2014}}</ref>

An assortment of varieties has been developed, such as '''mascatto kibi dango'' ([[Muscat of Alexandria|Muscat grape]] syrup filling), ''momo kibi dango'' (white peach syrup filling),  ''[[kinako]] kibi dango'' (sprinkled with [[kinako]] or dry soybean powder), and chocolate flavored varieties.<ref name="kahara-2004eng-p42"/>
