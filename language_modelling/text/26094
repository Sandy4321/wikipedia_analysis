The '''Henry Weinhard Brewery complex''', also the '''Cellar Building and Brewhouse''' and '''Henry Weinhard's City Brewery''' is a former brewery in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 2000, it and the neighboring [[A.B. Smith Automotive Building]] have been on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref> {{cite web

==Architectural details==

The firm of [[Whidden & Lewis]], Portland's pioneering architects, designed the Brewhouse. The building is designed in a [[mediveal]] [[Tuscan]] style. Completed in 1908, other businesses in the area hired architects to emulate this design theme when building their own warehouses and industrial buildings. <ref>King, Bart: An Architectural Guidebook to Portland, pg. 181. Gibbs Smith, 2001</ref> At its highest level, the structure has six floors.<ref> {{cite web

==Brewery History==

[[Henry Weinhard]] purchased an existing brewery on this site, the City Brewery, in 1864. He then moved his operations to the then-two block site on West Burnside Street. Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872, two additional blocks to the north were purchased. As many breweries also owned the saloons that sold their beer at the time, a large business empire owning properties throughout the Northwest, from [[San Francisco, CA|San Francisco]] to Canada was run from here. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand to the point where he even offered to pipe beer directly to the [[Skidmore Fountain]]. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually.

The present buildings were completed in 1908 in order to meet the expanding brewing needs of the Henry Weinhard brewing empire, now serving the Pacific Northwest and even the Phillipenes and China. Once [[Prohibition]] was enacted, the brewery managed to survive by brewing [[near-beer]] and soda marketed as "Gourmet Elixirs".

Mergers with and sales to other breweries would occur over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the [[Pabst Brewing Company]]. Pabst then sold the brewery to [[Stroh Brewing Company]] in 1996. The last and final sale of the company in 1999 would have major effects on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to [[Miller Brewing Company]], and moved all Henry's brewing operations to the [[Olympia Brewery]] in [[Tumwater, Washington]]. After nearly 135 years of continual operations, the Weinhard Brewery brewed its last beer on August 27 of 1999. It was put up for sale the following month. <ref> {{cite web

==Redevelopment and reuse==

In early 2000, local developers Gerdling-Edlen purchased the entire brewing complex, which consisted of five blocks by the end of brewing operations. GBD proceeded to develop a mixed-use area consisting of offices, retail, and condo towers known as the [[Brewery Blocks]]. As part of the project, historic buildings were to be preserved and integrated into the new development.<ref> {{cite web

 | accessdate = 2007-08-17}} </ref> The historic brewhouse's historical importance was recognized with a listing on the National Registry of Historic Places, along with the A.B. Smith Building's art deco facade, in August 2000, a year after brewing had ceased. 

The renovated Brewhouse was completed November 2002, after two years of extensive renovations. The west side of the Brewhouse's low as developed into Brewery Tower, an office building. The upper floors of the historic buildings are office space, and the first floors contain retail.<ref> {{cite web
