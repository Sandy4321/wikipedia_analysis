'''Muhammad 'Izzat Darwaza''' ({{lang-ar|<big><U+0645><U+062D><U+0645><U+062F> <U+0639><U+0632><U+062A> <U+062F><U+0631><U+0648><U+0632><U+0629></big>}} 1888-1984) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] politician, historian, and educator from [[Nablus]]. In his early career, he worked as an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] bureaucrat in [[Palestine]] and [[Lebanon]]. Darwaza had long been a sympathizer of [[Arab nationalism]], but became an activist of that cause following the [[Great Arab Revolt]] against the Ottoman Empire in 1916, joining the nationalist [[al-Fatat]] society. As such, he campaigned for the union of  [[Greater Syria]] (modern-day [[Levant]]) and vehmently opposed [[Zionism]] and foreign mandates in Arab lands. From 1922 to 1927, he served as an educator and as the principal at the [[an-Najah National University|an-Najah National School]] where he commenced an Arab nationalist educational process. Darwaza's particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by [[Islam]], his belief in Arab unity, and the oneness of [[Arabic culture]]. 

Later in his lifetime, Darwaza founded the nationalist [[Istiqlal]] party in Palestine and was a primary organizer of anti-British demonstrations. In 1937, he was exiled to [[Damascus]] as a result of his activities and from there he helped support the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]. He was incarcerated in Damascus by [[French Mandate of Syria|French authorities]] for his involvement in the revolt and while in prison he began to study the [[Qur'an]] and its interpretations. In 1945, after he was released, Darwaza eventually compiled his own interpretation entitled ''al-Tafsir al-Hadith''. 

In 1946 he joined the [[Arab Higher Committee]] led by [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]], but resigned the next year after being disenfranchised by al-Husayni's methods. He left for Syria afterward and briefly aided in the unity talks between Syria and Egypt in the mid-1950's. By the time of his death in 1984, Darwaza had written over thirty books and published numerous articles on the [[Definitions of Palestine and Palestinian|Palestinian question]], Arab history, and Islam.<ref name="Muslih"/> 

==Biography==
===Early life and background===
Darwaza was born to a middle-class [[Sunni Muslim]] mercantile family in [[Nablus]].<ref name="Muslih"/> The Darwaza family had long been involved in textiles and had extensive trade relationships with merchants in [[Beirut]] and [[Damascus]]. In his memoirs, Izzat writes "The import of [textile] goods from the outside was, for the most part, through Beirut and Damascus."<ref name="Doumani61">Doumani, 1995, pp.59-61.</ref>

Izzat's father, 'Abd al-Hadi Darwaza and his paternal grandfather Darwish Darwaza, owned a store in the [[Khan al-Tujjar (Nablus)|Khan al-Tujjar]] of Nablus.<ref name="Muslih"/> During his childhood, Izzat recalled "From what I remember from my father and through my grandfather, the title merchant or merchants in Nablus mostly referred to owners of commercial textile and cloth shops. In Nablus, these shops were confined, or mostly confined, to a caravansary called Khan al-Tujjar, in the middle of Nablus."<ref name="Doumani59">Doumani, 1995, p.57.</ref> 

Izzat received elementary and preparatory education in Ottoman government-run schools in the city.<ref name="Muslih"/> In addition to [[Arabic language|Arabic]], he learned [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[English language|English]], and [[French language|French]]. Darwaza left school without going to [[Istanbul]] or Beirut to finish his education as was the custom of his generation.<ref name="Choueiri25"/> Instead, he educated himself, and according to [[Rashid Khalidi]], became "a self-taught intellectual."<ref>Khalidi, 1993, p.178.</ref>

===Loyalty to disloyalty toward the Ottoman Empire===
Originally, Darwaza supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] based on his feelings of identification with [[Islam]] and belonging to the larger Ottoman Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' ("nation"). He was also an [[Arabism|Arabist]] and was enthusiastic about the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman regime would grant the Arabs their legitimate demands (i.e. reforms and autonomy within the framework of the empire, but not total independence).<ref name="HandS237"/> In 1906, he served in the local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus.<ref name="PASSIA"/> His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the [[Galilee]] and northern [[Samaria]]).<ref name="Muslih"/> 

His loyalty to the Ottomans eroded, however, due to the impact of the new regime's [[Turkification]] policies which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. As such, Darwaza was driven to support [[Pan-Arabism]] and [[Arab nationalism]].<ref name="HandS237">Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.237.</ref> In 1908, he joined the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its pro-Turkish views and ideals.<ref name="Muslih"/> 

Darwaza played an active role in establishing the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. Two years later, he joined an [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] group in Nablus in 1913. The group sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to [[Jew]]s by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan or by purchasing land for sale so that it could not be bought by Jews. In June 1913, he helped prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress in [[Paris]]. In congress, he was also the delegate for the [[Jamma'in]] subdistrict of the [[District of Nablus]].<ref name="Muslih"/> 

In 1914, Darwaza established the Arab Scientific Society, whose purpose was to spread [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] in the region through the etablishment of Arabic schools. The society did not succeed, however, due to the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name="Muslih"/> Within the DTPS, Darwaza was appointed commissioner and deputy for the Nablus Post Office. Darwaza was promoted again<U+2014>this time as director of postal stamp sales in [[Beirut]].<ref name="Muslih"/>

===Promoting unity with Syria===
[[Image:Izzat Darwaza.jpg|thumb|right|Darwaza in traditional Arab robe]]

During World War I, Darwaza served as Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and retained this post until 1918.<ref name="Muslih">Muslih, 1989, pp.146-148.</ref> In 1916, he joined the underground [[al-Fatat]] organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and unite the Arab lands under Ottoman rule.<ref name="MSN">[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580047/darwaza_izzat_muhammad.html Izzat Muhammad Darwaza] MSN Encarta.</ref> In the wake of the [[Great Arab Revolt]] of 1917, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in [[Faisal I|King Faisal]]'s provisional government in [[Damascus]]. Ideologically, Darwaza became an [[Arab nationalist]] endorsing the concept of a single [[Greater Syria|Greater Syrian Arab State]].<ref name="HandS237"/>

Following the [[World War I Armistice]], Darwaza held several important political posts including Secretary-General of al-Fatat from May 1919 to March 1920, Secretary of the Nablus Muslim-Christian Association, and Secretary of the First Palestinian Arab Congress in [[Jerusalem]] in 1919.<ref name="Muslih"/> During the spring and summer of 1919, a vigorous political campaign was waged by the Arab polticians in Palestine who were divided into "Younger Politicians" and "Older Politicians". The campaign was centered on the political future of Palestine and Darwaza, a Younger Politician, played a central role. The Younger Politicians consisted of Arab nationalists who sought to unite Palestine with King Faisal's Syria while the Older Politicians consisted of [[Palestinian nationalist]]s who preferred that Palestine be an independent entity.<ref name="Muslih193"/>

Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan<U+2014>another leading al-Fatat member from Nablus<U+2014>lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to advocate Syro-Palestinian unity before the arrival of the [[King-Crane Commission]] on June 10, 1919. They first met with [[Mohammad Amin al-Husayni]] and [[Kamil al-Husayni]] of al-Nadi al-Arabi and the latter immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet [[Raghib al-Nashashibi]], [[Hussam ad-Din Jarallah]], and [[Aref al-Dajani]], supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older Politicians of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that [[Musa al-Husayni]] was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older Politicians followed suit.<ref name="Muslih193">Muslih, 1989, pp.193-194.</ref> When the commission arrived in [[Jaffa]], it concluded on June 27 that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a [[British Mandate]].<ref>Muslih, 1989, p.196.</ref> 

In the first week of July 1919, the General Syrian Congress (GSC) held its first meeting in Damascus and Darwaza was its secretary. The GSC called for the immediate independence of Syria as a sovereign state under a constitutional monarchy and underlined its opposition to the establishment of Zionism in southern Syria (Palestine).<ref>Kayyali, 1978, p.69.</ref> Along with Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and [[Aref al-Aref]], Darwaza founded and became an officer of the Palestinian Society in Damascus. The organization urged all societies and clubs in Palestine to cooperate and condemn the [[San Remo Conference]]'s decision to grant [[Great Britain]] a mandate over Palestine and [[Transjordan]].<ref>Kayyali, 1978, p.79.</ref>

Darwaza's and the Younger Politicians' hopes for unity with Syria were dashed when it became known that King Faisal was aligning himself with the leaders of the Zionist movement because "they [the Zionists] were helping us [the Arabs] in the conference [ [[Paris Peace Conference]] ]." Later in his life, Darwaza remarked on Faisal's relationship with the Zionists, saying "Since the Arab revolt against the Turks, no Arab leader has been up to the level of events except for [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Jamal 'Abd al-Nasir]]." Darwaza now believed Faisal was someone who did not give Palestine the attention he thought it deserved. Faisal was deposed by the French in July 1920. An event that further deteriorated Darwaza's ambitions of Arab unity was the confirmation of the British Mandate over Palestine at the San Remo Conference on April 24, 1920.<ref>Muslih, 1989, p.203.</ref> His experience in Damascus revealed to him that the universalism of Arab nationalism was not as concrete as its advocates had thought and the military might of the colonial powers<U+2014>[[France]] and Great Britain<U+2014>were an overwhelming force to contend with.<ref name="HandS237"/>

===Educator in Nablus===
Darwaza represented Nablus in the Fourth Palestinian Congress in May 1921 and the Seventh Palestinian Congress in June 1928. From 1922 to 1927, he served as the principal of the an-Najah National School (later to become [[an-Najah National University]]) where he initiated and nurtured an Arab nationalist political educational process. Darwaza wrote textbooks and was an educator himself. One of his students who later became a nationalist politician, Akram Zuaiter, wrote that Darwaza "used to give us a weekly lesson on the principals of Nationalism and [modern] society, in a way which sharpened our thought and broadened our horizons." Zuaiter also recalls that Darwaza wrote up nationalist and historical plays that his students would perform in.<ref>Kedourie, Gammer, Kostiner, and Shemesh, 2003, [http://books.google.com/books?id=pgZ9cvt6JyQC&pg=PA38&dq=Izzat+Darwaza&lr=&ei=bec6SpStIYe-yQSSz8m6BQ p.31].</ref> 

===Fight against the British Mandate===
Darwaza became a member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was appointed by rival nationalist Mohammad Amin al-Husayni (now the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]) as the General Administrator of the [[Waqf]] (Islamic religious trust) under the [[Supreme Muslim Council]].<ref>Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p.114.</ref><ref name="PASSIA">[http://www.passia.org/palestine_facts/personalities/alpha_d.htm Palestinian personalities D] [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]]. (PASSIA).</ref> In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, [[Islamism]], and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.<ref name="KandM97"/> 

Darwaza began to edit in the ''al-Ja'miyya al-Arabiyya'' newspaper in the early 1930's and in December 1931-January 1932, he wrote articles encouraging Arabs to fight British policies in the [[Middle East]], to unite in the face of growing dangers, and to renew their drive towards freedom and independence.<ref>Kayyali, 1978, p.167.</ref> In August 1932, he along with [[Awni Abd al-Hadi]] and others founded the [[Independence Party (Palestine)|Istiqlal]] party in Palestine, an offshoot of al-Fatat. Originally, the Istiqlal operated in Syria, then Transjordan, but reassembled in Palestine after facing disappointing circumstances in both those territories. The party coaxed Palestinians towards defying British rule by staging demonstrations and political and social boycotts. Darwaza refused to allow the Istiqlal to participate in meetings between local Palestinian political parties and the British high-commissioner.<ref name="KandM97">Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p.97.</ref> Darwaza wrote an article on June 21, 1933, vehemently attacking Palestinian "vested interests". He argued that the wealthy Arab notables of Palestine were subservient to the British and the Zionists and would willingly leave Palestine for other countries, while the poor and middle-class Arabs had to remain to fight and die in their battle against British oppression.<ref>Kayyali, 1978, p.172.</ref> Darwaza helped instigate and organize the 1933 demonstrations in [[Jaffa]] which protested [[United Kingdom|British]] policy in Palestine and continued Jewish immigration.<ref name="MSN"/>

Darwaza was one of the principal organizers of the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936-1939 Arab uprising in Palestine]] which first erupted in his hometown Nablus.<ref name="MSN"/> During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by British authorities to Damascus.<ref>Levenberg, 1993, p.69.</ref> In Damascus, he established and headed the Central Committee for National Jihad in Palestine which echoed [[Izz al-Din al-Qassam]]'s call for a holy war against the British and Zionism. Darwaza had many encounters with al-Qassam, describing him as "a man lacking in arrogance or self-love. He was open and available to all of the people and the people loved him. And he lived the life of a ''[[mujahid]]''."<ref name="IQ">[http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/qassam.php The Life and Thought of 'Izz-Id-Din Al-Qassam]. The Islamic Quarterly, London.</ref> Darwaza worked closely with the Mufti, who was now under house arrest in Beirut, to garner support and supplies for the revolt and supervise the Arab rebels in Palestine.<ref>Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p.114.</ref> 

In late 1939, he was accused by French military authorities of helping Palestinian rebels in the revolt, tried by a military court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the [[Citadel of Damascus]].<ref name="Abu-Ghazaleh"/> While his exile by the British abruptly curtailed his political life, his imprisonment marked the beginning of a new life wherein the [[Qur'an]] becomes a major concern for the next several years.<ref name="HandS225">Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.225.</ref> He was released in November 1944.<ref name="Abu-Ghazaleh">Abu-Ghazaleh, 1973, p.22.</ref> After his release, Darwaza was unable to return to Nablus because British authorities had issued an order preventing him from entering Palestine. As a result, he left for [[Turkey]], mostly staying in [[Bursa]] until the end of 1945.<ref name="HandS226"/>

The Mufti re-established the [[Arab Higher Committee]] (AHC) in late 1946 and Darwaza joined the ten-member council upon a request from the Mufti.<ref>Khalaf, 1991, p.267.</ref> Darwaza, along with [[Emil Ghuri]] and Mu'in al-Madi, served as the AHC's delegates to the September 1947 convention of the [[Arab League]]'s Political Committee in Lebanon. With support from the Transjordanian representative, [[Saleh Jaber]], the [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], openly criticized the delegates and questioned the AHC's right to even send delegates to the convention.<ref>Khalaf, 1991, p.178.</ref> Later that year, Darwaza resigned from the AHC due to the Mufti's unbending attitude towards wider representation.<ref>Khalaf, 1991, p.130.</ref>

===Later life===
After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], Darwaza spent the rest of his life in the modern state of [[Syria]] where he left politics to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930's and 1940's, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960's.<ref name="Zebiri145"/>
 
As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and [[Egypt]] forming the short-lived [[United Arab Republic]]. After Egypt adopted its 1956 [[Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite.<ref name="PandM29">Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p.29.</ref> When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the [[United States|American]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and [[India]]n models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.<ref>Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p.26.</ref>

In 1983, Darwaza granted Palestinian historian Muhammad Y. Muslih an eight-day interview and allowed him to photo-copy his memoirs in entirety, although according to Muslih, Darwaza was failing in health.<ref>Muslih, 1988, p.xi.</ref> He died in 1984 at the age of 96.<ref name="Zebiri145">Zebiri, 1993, pp.145-146.</ref> Darwaza had three daughters, Najah, Salma, and Rudaina and a son, Zuhair.

==Literary works==
One of the first modern histories of the [[Arab world|Arab nation]] in contrast to a history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920's under the title ''Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times''. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the [[Semitic peoples]], the [[rise of Islam]], the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended to be used as a textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later [[British Mandate of Iraq|Iraq]], hence its simplified and direct language, however, it had a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.<ref name="Choueiri25">Choueiri, 2000, pp.25-26.</ref> 

In 1934, Darwaza published a widely read story, ''The Angel and the Land Broker'', reflecting popular Arab sentiments against the growing "Zionist threat" and attacking brokers who tempted Palestinian land owners to sell their land to Jews. The story describes methods used by Zionists to entice Arab landowners to sell their land and the main characters in the story are an illiterate farmer and a Jewish girl from [[Tel Aviv]] who encourages the former to spend himself deep into debt, forcing him to sell his land at a price far below its value.<ref>Sufian and LeVine, 2007, p.294.</ref>  

Later in his lifetime after leaving politics, Darwaza published memoirs that discussed in detail the city of Nablus in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Youssef Choueiri, "he gives a graphic and almost exhaustive description of his hometown... its mosques, residential quarters, orchards, industries, and inhabitants. Moreover, he dwells at length of the social composition of the town endeavoring to reveal the open conflict between 'feudal families' and the new generation of middle traders, functionaries, civil servants, and teachers."<ref name="Choueiri25"/>   
 
===Qur'anic studies and interpretations===   
While he was imprisoned in Damascus, Darwaza was provided with an opportunity to read and reflect upon the [[Qur'an]]. He states "I considered [this opportunity] an act of divine [favor] and started reading whatever books of [[exegesis]] and qur'anic studies were accessible to me." During his incarceration, he compiled three books dealing with the Qur'an and conceived the idea of writing a modern ''[[tafsir]]'' ("interpretation").<ref name="HandS225"/>  

His time in Turkey exposed him to the libraries of Bursa and it was there where he wrote the rough draft oh his ''tafsir'' entitled ''al-Tafsir al-Hadith''. Darwaza states in this exegesis he would "uncover the wisdom of revelation, the fundamental concepts of the Qur'an and the whole range of its subject matter and present it in a new style and new sequential order." ''Al-Tafsir al-Hadith'' was generally aimed at the Muslim youth who had been alienated by the traditional interpretations of the Qur'an.<ref name="Zebiri145"/> Darwaza placed much emphasis on the close relationship between the text of the Qur'an and the environment in which it was revealed. He rejected the ''[[hadith]]'' which states the Qur'an was originally preserved on a tablet in the [[Seven Heavens#Seven Heavens in Islam|seventh heaven]] and sent down to lowest heaven and from there gradually to [[Muhammad]].<ref name="Zebiri145"/>

After the completion of the rough draft he wrote a volume of four chapters, ''Qur'an al-Majid'', which served as an introduction for the ''tafsir''.<ref name="HandS226">Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.226.</ref> Darwaza stresses a close connection between the Qur'an and the biography of the Muhammad (''sira'') and states that the Qur'an fully reflects various stages between the Qur'an and the career of Muhammad.<ref name="HandS228">Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.228.</ref> He also emphasizes that both the [[angel]]s and the ''[[jinn]]'' are spoken in the Qur'an not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions an goals.<ref>Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.232.</ref> 

He contends that the presentation of the Qur'an and its ''[[sura]]s'' was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of [[Abu Bakr]] was to collect the Qur'an between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while [[Uthman]]'s task was fixing the transcription and unifying it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that [[Ali]], as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern exegates who used certain verses of the Qur'an to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Qur'an.<ref name="HandS228"/>

Darwaza was convinced that interpretations of the Qur'an were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political, and social thought and that the Qur'an was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thought.<ref>Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.228.</ref> Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole ''tafsir''<U+2014>which Darwaza did<U+2014>he had to justify his position by seeking a ''[[fatwa]]'' from the [[mufti]]s of [[Aleppo]] and Damascus.<ref>Hawting and Shareef, 1993, p.240.</ref>

==Version of Arab nationalism==
Throughout his life, Darwaza was an [[Arab nationalist]] and supported the unity of Syria and Palestine. His particular brand of Arab nationalism was influenced by [[Islam]], his belief in Arab unity, and the oneness of [[Arabic culture]]. According to his perspective, the ideology's main points were the [[Arabic language]], the Arab homeland, a shared Arab history and common Arab interests. Although Darwaza believed that Arab nationalism pre-dated Islam, he also maintained that Islam expanded Arab territory and "stamped them with the eternal mark of Arab nationalism". According to Muhammad Y. Muslih, this meant that Islam had provided Arabs with "spiritual, cultural, and legal unity and within the framework of that unity the Arab individual formed his moral and social beliefs, irrespective of where he lived and through it the Arabs were able to preserve national identity and maintain their culture in the face of foreign invaders, including the Ottomans".<ref name="Muslih"/> Darwaza contends that Arab nationalism is not a new concept borrowed from the West and asserts the constituents of Arab nationalism are stronger than those which make up the modern [[nationalism]].<ref>Hawting and Shareef, 1993, pp.245-246.</ref>   

His ideas helped the spread the word of secular pan-Arabism against [[Islamism|religious nationalist]]s and those who believed in separate [[Syrian nationalism|Syrian]], [[Lebanese nationalism|Lebanese]], and [[Palestinian nationalism|Palestinian destinies]].<ref name="Khalidi179"/> In the mid-1950's, Darwaza asserted that the first stage of Arab union should be based on a merger between Egypt and Syria. In his opinion, a union between the northern Arabs (Syria) and the southern Arabs (Egypt) would facilitate the adherence of other Arab states.<ref>Podeh and Ma'oz, 1999, p.7.</ref> He believed that EGypt's capabilities and human resources compelled it to fill the role of an Arab "[[Prussia]]".<ref name="PandM29"/>

[[Rashid Khalidi]] states about Darwaza, "Moved as he was by the civilization of Arabs, he evoked a distant Arab past. For obvious reasons Islam was central to that past. But in the case of Darwaza, Islam was important not as the binding substance of the nation, but as a culture and civilization. In other words, culture, language, and history not [[Umma|religious solidarity]] were posited as the glue that was to hold the Arab nation together." According to Khalidi, Darwaza contributed to Arab nationalism in the practical and intellectual domains greatly.<ref name="Khalidi179">Khalidi, 1993, p.179.</ref>
