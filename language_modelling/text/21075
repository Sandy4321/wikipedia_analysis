This '''timeline of prehistoric Scotland''' is a chronologically ordered list of important [[archaeological site]]s in [[Scotland]] and of major events affecting Scotland's human inhabitants and culture during the [[List of time periods#Prehistorical periods|prehistoric period]]. The period of [[Prehistory|prehistory]] prior to occupation by the genus ''Homo'' is part of the [[geology of Scotland]].

[[Prehistoric Scotland|Prehistory in Scotland]] ends with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in southern Scotland in the first century AD and the beginning of [[Protohistory|written records]].<ref>Moffat (2005) ''Chapter 7: Caledonia''. pp. 225&ndash;53. Petilius Cerilais first led the legions into Scotland between AD 71 and 74. Large parts of Scotland were never held by Rome and Moffat states: "The Romans left us nothing of any enduring cultural value. Their presence was brief, intermittent and not influential."</ref> The archaeological sites and events listed are the earliest examples or among the most notable of their type.

No traces have yet been found of either a [[Neanderthal]] presence or of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' during the [[Pleistocene]] [[interglacial]]s. The first indications of humans in Scotland occur only after the [[Last glacial period|ice retreated]] in the [[11th millennium BC]] and the current [[Flandrian interglacial]] began. Since that time the landscape of Scotland has been altered dramatically by both human and natural forces.<ref>Edwards, Kevin J and Ralston, Ian B.M. "Environment and People in Prehistoric and Early Historical Times: Preliminary Considerations" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Initially, [[sea level]]s were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the [[Orkney]] archipelago and many of the [[Inner Hebrides|Inner Hebridean]] islands were attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of [[Great Britain]] to [[Continental Europe]]. Much of the present-day [[North Sea]] was also dry land until after 4000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]. [[Dogger Bank]], for example was part of a large peninsula connected to the [[Europe|European]] continent. This would have made travel to western and northern [[Scotland]] relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent [[isostasy|isostatic]] rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task and there are numerous [[raised beach]]es around Scotland's coastline.<ref> Murray (1973) p. 69.</ref><ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 46&ndash;50.</ref>

Many of the sites are located in the [[Highlands and Islands]]. This may be because of the relatively sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of [[peat]] that preserves stone fragments, although the associated [[acid]]ic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials.<ref>Peat forms when plant material is inhibited from decaying fully by acidic and anaerobic conditions, often in waterlogged conditions. Much of Scotland's soil cover is either peat, or acidic or both. This results in a lack of finds of bone, jewellery and other household items. See for example Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 25, Moffat (2005) pp. 81, 152 and [http://www.peatsociety.org/index.php?id=32 "What is peat?"]  International Peat Society. Retrieved [[27 April]] [[2008]].</ref> There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and [[Arable land|arable land]] predominate.<ref>Wickham-Jones (2007) p. 25.</ref> Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 96&ndash;97.</ref> 

Differentiating the various [[List of archaeological periods|periods of human history]] involved is a complex task. The [[Paleolithic]] lasted until the retreat of the ice, the [[Mesolithic]] until the adoption of farming and the [[Neolithic]] until [[metalworking]] commenced. These events may have begun at different times in different parts of the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 147.</ref>

Scotland was still [[glacier|glaciated]] when the cave paintings of [[Lascaux]] in France were created, circa 14,000 BC. Human settlement therefore began much later in Scotland than in southern Europe due to the adverse climatic conditions further north. The very limited [[archaeology|archaeological]] record provides little to suggest that culture in Scotland caught up with developing societies to the south during this period of [[Holocene climatic optimum|improved climatic conditions]]. Some finds nonetheless indicate the presence of relatively large and well-organised [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. No Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered in Scotland to date.<ref>Finlayson, Bill and Edwards, Kevin J. "The Mesolithic" in Edwards & Ralston (2003) pp. 122&ndash;23.</ref>

Scotland's [[Neolithic]] discoveries portray a radical departure from the earlier hunter-gatherer societies. During this period complex societies evolve that are capable of creating substantial structures.  Development is by no means linear and architectural advances are often followed by periods of stagnation and even reversal. The Balbridie site, for example, is matched by only two others so far discovered in Scotland at [[Kelso]] and in the [[Forth Valley]] and they are quite dissimilar from both anything found earlier and the monumental stone structures found later. No timber buildings of a similar size were re-created until the [[Saxons|Saxon]] invasions some four millennia later.<ref name=M109/> The great [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney|Orcadian Neolithic monuments]] were constructed contemporaneously with the emergence of the [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian culture]], more than 500 years before the building of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] and almost a millennium before the [[sarsen]] stones of [[Stonehenge]] were erected.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
[[Image:Eildon Hill North.jpg|thumb|[[Eildon Hill]] - a triple peak and [[hill fort]]]]
From the commencement of the [[Bronze Age]] to about 2000 BC the archaeological record shows a decline in the number of large new stone buildings constructed. [[Pollen analyses]] suggest that at this time woodland increased at the expense of the area under cultivation. In Orkney, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new [[Beaker people|Beaker]] culture began to dominate. Bronze and Iron Age metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from [[Europe]] over a lengthy period. (By contrast, the Neolithic monumental culture spread south from northern Scotland into [[England]].) As the Bronze Age developed, Scotland's population grew to perhaps 300,000 in the second millennium BC.<ref>Moffat (2005) pp. 154, 158, 161.</ref><ref>Whittington, Graeme and Edwards, Kevin J. (1994) [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_124/124_055_065.pdf "Palynology as a predictive tool in archeaology"] (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. '''124''' pp. 55&ndash;65.</ref> There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a [[Celt|Celtic]] culture in Scotland,<ref>Moffat (2005) p. 183.</ref> although the nature of the resident [[Pict|Pictish]] civilisation and their immediate predecessors remains enigmatic. There were evidently significant differences between the lifestyles of Bronze Age peoples inhabiting Scotland. For example, finds at the Traprain Law site (near modern [[Edinburgh]]) suggest that the priests there may have overseen ceremonies on a par with their contemporaries on mainland Europe. On the other hand, although the mummifications found at Cladh Hallan in the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]] invite comparisons with Egypt, the simple lifestyle of the inhabitants of this settlement contrasts with that of [[Tutankamun]] - even if the former's lives may have been preferable to those of the toiling slaves who built [[Amarna]] at this time.

==Sites of uncertain date==

[[Image:Scotland Inchnadamph Bone Caves.jpg|upright|thumb|Inchnadamph Caves]]
[[Image:Towriepetrosphere.jpg|upright|thumb|Drawing of a Carved Stone Ball from Aberdeenshire, dated from 3200&ndash;2500&nbsp;BC]]
Various sites of importance are as yet undated and difficult to place in the timeline. Others contain items from many different periods whose story has not yet been unraveled or items where the time period and location cannot be easily reconciled. The last two items on the list may date from the [[Dark Ages]] some four centuries or more after the appearance of the Romans and the commencement of the historic era.
