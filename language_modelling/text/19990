[[File:Kirby and the Rainbow Curse Wii U gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|256px|left|A pre-release gameplay screenshot of ''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse''. Kirby follows a line drawn on the Wii U Gamepad and collects stars scattered around levels to activate the "Star Dash" power-up.]]

''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse'' carries on the style of gameplay from ''Canvas Curse'', presenting the game with a unique modelling clay look. Players use the [[Wii U GamePad]] to help [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], who is stuck in a ball form, move across the level by drawing rainbow colored lines on the touchscreen to guide him. Making Kirby go through loops will speed him up, while touching him will put him into a spinning attack to use against enemies. For every 100 stars Kirby collects, Kirby can perform a Star Dash which increases his size, allowing him to charge through normally-indestructible blocks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/axyj/rainbow/move_lb02.html |title=<U+30BF><U+30C3><U+30C1><U+30DA><U+30F3>1<U+672C><U+3067><U+81EA><U+7531><U+306B><U+64CD><U+4F5C>! <U+30B9><U+30BF><U+30FC><U+30C0><U+30C3><U+30B7><U+30E5> |website=nintendo.co.jp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226184107/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/axyj/rainbow/move_lb02.html |archivedate=2014-12-26 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-12-26 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Manipulating For Your Benefit As You Please With One Touch Pen!

The game features [[Amiibo]] support with the Kirby, [[King Dedede]], and [[Meta Knight]] figures from the ''Super Smash Bros.'' range. The Kirby figure allows Kirby to activate the "Star Dash" ability at any time, the King Dedede figure gives Kirby extra [[hitpoint]]s, and the Meta Knight figure gives him greater attack power during his touch-activated spinning attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/axyj/amiibo/lb01.html |title=<U+30BF><U+30C3><U+30C1><U+FF01><U+30AB><U+30FC><U+30D3><U+30A3><U+30B9><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30EC><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30DC><U+30FC><U+FF1A><U+4F7F><U+3048><U+308B><U+FF41><U+FF4D><U+FF49><U+FF49><U+FF42><U+FF4F><U+306F><U+3053><U+306E>3<U+4F53><U+FF01><U+30AB><U+30FC><U+30D3><U+30A3> |website=nintendo.co.jp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226185342/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/axyj/amiibo/lb01.html |archivedate=2014-12-26 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2014-12-26 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Touch!

==Plot==
One day in Dream Land, as [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] and [[Waddle Dee]] are playing together, a mysterious hole opens in the sky, draining all the color from Dream Land and stopping everything and everyone in its tracks. Elline, a paintbrush fairy from the land of Seventopia, goes through the portal in order to escape an evil force and uses her powers to bring color back to Kirby and Waddle Dee. Learning from Elline that they must stop the evil Claycia in order to restore color to Dream Land, Kirby and Waddle Dee go with her to Seventopia in order to save the day. On the last world's final boss stage, it is revealed that Claycia was possessed by Dark Crafter which has the urge to drain ALL of the color in a specific place. When Kirby finds out about this, he transforms into a rocket in order to pursue the color stealing beast. After Kirby destroys the stealer, Kirby, Waddle Dee, Claycia, and Elline return to Dream Land and bring back all of the missing color into Popstar.

==Development==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}

When they first saw the Wii U GamePad, the developers realized they could incorporate asymmetric multiplayer into the new ''Kirby'' game and decided that, while Wii Remote players would have a more traditional running-and-jumping platformer experience, the GamePad player would draw "footholds". They decided to use the same line-drawing gameplay from ''Kirby: Canvas Curse''. The Wii U game's [[polymer clay]] art style was chosen to create a more three-dimensional version of the DS game's painterly style, while the framerate of the animations was kept low so the game would look like it was made in [[claymation]]. Waddle Dees were chosen as the multiplayer characters because the developers felt that Meta Knight or King Dedede were not as well-suited to protect Kirby.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/02/kirby_and_the_rainbow_curse_developers_give_background_on_design_decisions |title=Kirby and the Rainbow Curse Developers Give Background on Design Decisions |last=Vogel |first=Mitch |date=2015-02-16 |website=Nintendo Life |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150216225907/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/02/kirby_and_the_rainbow_curse_developers_give_background_on_design_decisions |archivedate=2015-02-16 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-02-16}}</ref>

''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse'' has received generally positive reviews from many publications, earning aggregate scores of 76/100 from Metacritic and 76% from GameRankings.<ref name="metacritic score"/><ref name="gamerankings score"/>

Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu awarded ''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse'' a 34 out of 40, with one reviewer stating "Although guiding a character by drawing lines with the GamePad isn<U+2019>t a new mechanism in itself, the game deserves applause for making that mechanism more interesting to play. The visuals are cute and look like clay animation. The game is filled with a surprisingly diverse load of gimmicks so it excites in many ways. The game is packed with the true charm of action games."<ref name="famitsu review"/>

[[Giant Bomb]]'s Dan Ryckert gave ''Kirby and the Rainbow Curse'' two stars out of five, comparing the title negatively to its DS predecessor. He felt that the levels were too simple and linear, with collectibles too easy to reach. He disliked that Kirby could not steal enemies' abilities like in ''Canvas Curse'', and thought that the vehicles Kirby could turn into made certain levels "even more stripped-down." While he found the controls functional, the repetitive boss fights were frustrating due to the stylus' lack of precision. Ryckert preferred to play as a Waddle Dee, whose traditional control scheme afforded more reliable platforming and boss fighting than the "unreliable stylus paths" provided. However, Ryckert did find the clay-based art style "gorgeous."<ref name="giant bomb review"/>

[[IGN]]'s Marty Sliva found the game much more enjoyable, awarding it 8.0/10. He appreciated the game's occasional difficulty and its variety, finding the vehicular stages enjoyable and the various world themes beautiful. Sliva thought that the visuals were "absolutely gorgeous," praising details like fingerprints in the clay and the stop-motion movements of the bosses, but was disappointed that he had to focus on the GamePad instead of an HDTV. He found that Waddle Dee multiplayer did not "add a whole lot to the experience," but it was "a nice experiment to test out."<ref name="ign review"/>

Nintendo Life's Jon Walgren gave ''Rainbow Curse'' seven stars out of ten. He found the game "charming" and the its visuals "the prettiest [...] on Wii U so far," but was disappointed that the clay aesthetic did not influence the gameplay like the fabric did in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn''. He thought the main campaign was easy, but the Challenge Mode and the search for collectibles provided a bit more difficulty. Like other reviewers, Walgren would have liked to see the game in high definition but found he had to focus on the GamePad's low-definition screen. Playing with others was "pleasant," but it was not the best local mutliplayer experience on Wii U.<ref name="nintendo life review"/>

Popzara's Cory Galliher noted the game's steeper learning curve than most Kirby games but found enough to "recommend the pink puffball<U+2019>s latest to patient gamers and those with more casual friends, family members or significant others."<ref name="popzara game review"/>

[[Hardcore Gamer]]'s Dermot Creegan gave the game a 4.5/5, calling it a "constantly creative adventure that offers players something they won<U+2019>t find anywhere else." He praised the claymation aesthetic calling them "astoundingly beautiful," while also complementing the amount of collectibles and challenges.<ref name="Hardcore Gamer"/>

In its launch week in Japan, 32,000 copies of the game were sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/kirby_and_the_rainbow_curse_misses_out_on_topping_japanese_charts_at_launch |title=Kirby and the Rainbow Curse Misses Out on Topping Japanese Charts at Launch |last=Olney |first=Alex |date=2015-01-28 |website=Nintendo Life |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129013647/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/kirby_and_the_rainbow_curse_misses_out_on_topping_japanese_charts_at_launch |archivedate=2015-01-29 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-01-29}}</ref>
