In [[mathematics]], the '''Kontorovich-Lebedev transform''' is an [[integral transform]] which uses a Macdonald function (modified [[Bessel_function|Bessel function]] of the second kind) with [[Imaginary_number|imaginary]] index as its '''kernel'''. Unlike other Bessel function transforms, such as the [[Hankel_transform|Hankel transform]], this transform involves integrating over the '''index''' of the function rather than its argument.

The transform of a function f(x) and its inverse (provided they exist) are given below:

:<math>g(y) = \int_0^{\infty} f(x) K_{ix}(y) dx  </math>

:<math>f(x) = \frac{2}{\pi^2 x} \int_0^{\infty} g(y) K_{iy}(x) sinh (\pi y) y dy . </math>

Laguerre previously studied a similar transform regarding [[Laguerre function]] as:

:<math>g(y) = \int_0^{\infty} f(x)e^{-x} L_{y}(x) dx  </math>

:<math>f(x) = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{g(y)}{\Gamma (y)} L_{y}(x) dy  </math>

Erd<U+00E9>lyi ''et al'', for instance, contains a short list of Kontorovich-Lebedev transforms as well references to the original work of Kontorovich and Lebedev in the late 1930s.
This transform is mostly used in solving the Laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates
for wedge shaped domains by the method of separation of variables.
