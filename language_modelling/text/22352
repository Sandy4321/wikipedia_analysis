'''''Love, Loss, and What I Wore''''' is a play written by [[Nora Ephron|Nora]] and [[Delia Ephron]] based on the 1995 book of the same name by [[Ilene Beckerman]].  It is organized as a series of monologues and uses a rotating cast of five principal women. The subject matter of the monologues includes women's relationships and wardrobes and at times the interaction of the two, using the female wardrobe as a time capsule of a woman's life.

The show was initially presented as a part of the 2008 summer series at Guild Hall in [[East Hampton, NY]], and then as a benefit series at the DR2 Theatre in New York in early 2009.  Later the same year, the show was produced [[Off-Broadway]] as an ongoing commercial theatrical production at the [[Westside Theatre]] in New York, where it continues to run as the second-longest running show in the theatre's history.  The production and its cast received positive critical attention. The production won the 2010 [[Drama Desk Award for Unique Theatrical Experience]] as well as the 2010 [[Broadway.com]] Audience Award for Favorite New Off-Broadway Play. 

The show has been produced on six continents and more than eight countries. It began a national tour in the United States in September 2011 in Chicago. It is making an encore performance in Paris in January 2012.

==Background and development==
[[Nora Ephron]] is a writer, director and producer best known for writing the screenplays of [[romantic comedy]] films.  She has received three [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]], for ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989) and ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993).<ref name=Eic>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/mar/03/fiction|title=Everything is copy|accessdate=2011-08-13|date=2007-03-03|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Brockes, Emma }}</ref>  She has also written five best-selling books,<ref name=Eic/>  and she wrote the 2002 play ''[[Imaginary Friends (play)|Imaginary Friends]]'', which fictionalizes the antagonistic relationship between [[Lillian Hellman]] and [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]].  Ephron sometimes co-authors screenplays with her sister, writer-producer [[Delia Ephron]], including ''[[You've Got Mail]]'' (1998), ''[[Hanging Up]]'' (2000) and ''[[Bewitched (movie)|Bewitched]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/530551/Nora-Ephron|title=Nora Ephron|accessdate=2011-10-23|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/167232/Delia-Ephron|title=Delia Ephron|accessdate=2011-10-23|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Nora Ephron wrote the introduction to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities.<ref name=NEBLTMA/>  She identified with the stories in ''Love, Loss, and What I Wore'' because the book "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, those moments when we are constantly trying to find our identity through them".<ref name=NEBLTMA/>  Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her own version of the book.<ref name=NEBLTMA/>  Once she decided to adapt ''Love, Loss, and What I Wore'' into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.<ref name=NEBLTMA/> <!-- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SCRIPT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008?   -->

The show's monologues are sourced largely from Beckerman's book.<ref name=KCtDJLLaWIWDtI/> The Ephrons wove together a collection of stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including [[Rosie O'Donnell]].<ref name=LLaWIW/><ref name=TR/>  One of the monologues<!-- WHICH ONE? --> that became a highlight of the original production was based on Nora Ephron's [[New York Times Non-Fiction Bestsellers of 2006|2006 best-seller]] ''[[I Feel Bad About My Neck]]''.<ref name=SA/>  <!-- HOW DID THE EPHRONS FIND A PRODUCER, DIRECTOR AND CAST? -->

==Plot==
A character called Gingy acts as the narrator.<ref name=TR/> The show opens with her sketching various parts of her wardrobe that stir the most poignant memories.<ref name=LLaWIW/> She weaves her life story among the other tales, describing her three marriages, "motherhood and the death of a child, each turning point marked by a particular item of clothing".<ref name=SA/> Her life is represented beginning with experiences in a [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] dress and extending through her full life.<ref name=LLaWIWTR/>

In addition to Gingy, one character serves as the vixen, another plays a vulnerable gang member from Chicago, a third portrays a brave cancer patient, and the last serves as a mature woman pierced by vivid memories.<ref name=LLaWIW/> One of these characters, named Heather, chooses conservative "think" shoes over [[high heels]] in her youth, but at a later stage in life shows a preference for high heels.<ref name=LLaWIWTR/> The gang member likes insignias that are prominent on sweaters and their creator.<ref name=LLaWIWTR/> Among the 28 stories, other notable tales include one about the influence of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] (with discourse including "Any American woman under 40 who says she<U+2019>s never dressed as Madonna is either lying or [[Amish]]."); one about dressing room anxiety (a story revolving around the concept that "I<U+2019>m an 8. I<U+2019>ve always been an 8"); and one about your mother's tastes in clothes ("I don<U+2019>t understand, you could look so good if you tried").<ref name=TR/><ref name=LLaWIWTR/>  Three of the characters sometimes work as a trio and all characters have monologues.<ref name=LLAWIWTMdc>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/10-2009/love-loss-and-what-i-wore_21583.html|title=Love, Loss, and What I Wore|accessdate=2011-08-20|date=2009-10-02|publisher=TheaterMania.com, Inc.|author=MacDonald, Sandy}}</ref>

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' spent a full paragraph on a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] about two [[high school prom]] dresses.  The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black [[mini dress]] that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: "Here<U+2019>s the thing <U+2014> I<U+2019>ve never really known for sure which of those two people I am <U+2014> the girl who almost doesn<U+2019>t get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets to go with the really cute guy. Every time I thought I knew which one I was, I turned out to be the other. Which is one reason I think I got married, to, like, end the confusion."<ref name=TR/>

''[[The New York Times]]'' presented three stories that it felt were particularly emotional: the first was about a woman who removed [[miniskirt]]s from her college wardrobe after being raped, but continued wearing her favorite boots; another was about wedding attire anxieties; and the third was about the choice of adorning a newly-reconstructed breast with a tattoo.<ref name=SA/>  In addition to these three stories, the same article also noted a humorous ode to black as a part of a wardrobe or in fact as a wardrobe, when one character notes: "Sometimes I buy something that isn<U+2019>t black, and I put it on and I am so sorry".<ref name=SA/>

Other stories include recollections about the dress purchased for the date with a guy who subsequently married someone else; the foibles of [[spandex]] bras that result in a look known as the monoboob; issues involving toe cleavage; the [[Juicy Couture]] tracksuit that is a prominent staple of California wardrobes; wardrobe choice on the wrong day of the month; and the story about an incarcerated lover and the strategic hole in a certain pair of pants.<ref name=TR/>

The production has continued at the Westside Theatre with an open-ended commercial run with the casting strategy of rotating 4-week casts because it enables the production to pursue higher caliber actors. Nora Ephron stated at one question and answer session: "We keep re-casting it so we can get really great actresses to come for four weeks. It is really hard to get really good people to work Off-Broadway for six months because it does not pay much, but you can get them for four weeks."<ref name=NEBLTMA>{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptons.com/Out-And-About/Top-Stories/9633/Nora-Ephron-Brings-Laughs-To-Madison-Avenue.html|title=Nora Ephron Brings Laughs To Madison Avenue|accessdate=2011-08-12|date=2009-12-21|work=[[Hamptons (magazine)|Hamptons]]|author=Harrington, Douglas}}</ref>  Other well-known actresses who have performed in the Off-Broadway production include the following: [[Carol Kane]], [[Debra Monk]], [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Melissa Joan Hart]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Victoria Clark]], [[Tovah Feldshuh]], [[Loretta Swit]], [[Mary Testa]], [[Nikki Blonsky]], [[Donna McKecknie]], [[B.

==Themes==
The show, which has a running time of about 1&nbsp;hour and 30&nbsp;minutes,<ref name=LLaWIW/> is composed of 28 different stories that seek to illuminate the female identity.<ref name=LLaWIWTR>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/love-loss-and-what-i-29593|title=Love, Loss, and What I Wore <U+2013> Theater Review|accessdate=2011-04-21|date=2010-10-15|author=Reiner, Jay|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>  Generally composed of comic stories, the show often addresses sad, bitter or sentimental issues.<ref name=SA/><ref name=LLaWIWTO>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/arts-culture/theater/51463/love-loss-and-what-i-wore|title=Love, Loss and What I Wore|accessdate=2011-04-21|date=2009-10-05|author=Shaw, Helen|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]}}</ref>  Beckerman's memoir takes as its departure the clothing worn at pivotal times of her life and serves as the foundation for the show.  The Ephrons augmented this with a collection of similarly themed stories presented by four additional characters.<ref name=LLaWIW/><ref name=TR/>

The show is staged in what is described as an "unapologetically low-tech" manner.<ref name=TR/> The play uses clothing as a metaphor for women's experiences.<ref name=LLaWIW/> In addition to clothing, accessories such as a [[Handbag|purse]] are important, and [[Charles Isherwood]] of ''The New York Times'' notes that when Ms. Ephron views a purse, "In the chaos of its interior she sees a symbol of herself, as in a dark mirror smudged with old lipstick and smelling of spilled perfume."<ref name=SA/>  The show consists of five women's monologues about wardrobe malfunctions, [[puberty]]'s relationship with personal wardrobe, first date outfits, lucky underwear, [[prom]] dresses, favorite boots, irreplaceable shirts, the detested, disorganized purse, and experiences in the dressing room. The recollections about the clothing prompt the women's memories about their mothers, boyfriends, husbands, ex-husbands, sisters and grandchildren.<ref name=LLaWIW/><ref name=TR/>

==Critical reaction==
The original benefit series was described as intimate and starry by Broadway.com.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/shows/love-loss-and-what-i-wore/buzz/131990/love-loss-and-what-i-wore-to-play-off-broadways-westside-theatre/|title=Love, Loss, and What I Wore to Play Off-Broadway's Westside Theatre |accessdate=2011-08-12|date=2009-06-24|publisher=[[Broadway.com]]}}</ref>  Isherwood described the Off-Broadway play as a "show about matters of the heart and matters of the closet" in ''The New York Times''.<ref name=SA/> In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Marilyn Stasio]] called it "a bittersweet meditation on the joys and tribulations of women's lives, reflected through the prism of their clothes".<ref name=LLaWIW>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941288?refcatid=33|title=Love, Loss, and What I Wore|accessdate=2011-04-21|date=2009-10-01|author=Stasio, Marilyn|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> In [[Bloomberg News]], the critics commented that the playwrights were "literary alchemists expert at mixing the sentimental and the satirical and turning out something poignant" and noted that the clothing and accessories dominated the memories while "The men are extras."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=azQrlpnof5uE|title=Letts's <U+2018>Donuts<U+2019> Is Splendid; Ephrons Cast Spell: N.Y. Theater |accessdate=2011-04-21|date=2009-10-03|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|author=Simon, John and Jeremy Gerard}}</ref> The ''Los Angeles Times'' described the show as a cross between ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' and ''[[What Not to Wear (UK TV series)|What Not to Wear]]''.<ref name=TR/> Helen Shaw, writing for ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'', also described the Ephrons' style as similar to ''The Vagina Monologues''s' [[Eve Ensler]].<ref name=LLaWIWTO/>  Jay Reiner of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also notes that from the work "a tapestry of the collective female psyche emerges that is tender and insightful without being sentimental".<ref name=LLaWIWTR/> TheaterMania.com, Inc. describes the show as "So insightful and entertaining is this survey of sartorial preoccupations and the deeper questions underlying them that multiple viewings would be advisable."<ref name=LLAWIWTMdc/>

A highlight derived from Ephron's book and that was consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal of the role of the purse in the scene "I Hate My Purse!".<ref name=SA/><ref name=LLaWIWTR/> While Reiner says, "There's an amusing 'I hate my purse' segment",<ref name=LLaWIWTR/> Isherwood notes "The smartest and shapeliest piece of writing in the show is that acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O<U+2019>Donnell, who does it proud, the essay is a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j<U+2019>accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag."<ref name=SA/>  Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an [[aria]],<ref name=LLaWIWTO/> and Jerry Tallmer of ''[[The Villager]]'' called it "one of the pillars of the show".<ref name=Utywiw/> This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermania.com/off-broadway/news/04-2010/joanna-gleason-jill-zarin-set-for-new-york-bag-lad_27007.html|title=Joanna Gleason, Jill Zarin Set for New York Bag Ladies Luncheon|accessdate=2011-08-20|date=2010-04-29|publisher=TheaterMania.com, Inc.|author=Bacalzo, Dan}}</ref>

Isherwood also notes that this serves a female audience. "If there are chick flicks and chick lit <U+2014> derogatory though some might find those terms to be <U+2014> ''Love, Loss, and What I Wore'' should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed."<ref name=SA/>  ''The Los Angeles Times'' notes the light nature of the subject matter: "...isn<U+2019>t out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..."<ref name=TR/>  According to Reiner, the show points out that "...if there is one thing the females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself."  He also notes that the entire performance has meaning as it is "jam-packed and resonant" throughout.<ref name=LLaWIWTR/> Shaw notes that "The cozy humor strikes many women<U+2019>s funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations."<ref name=LLaWIWTO/>

Certain monologues on subjects such as weight, status bags and high heels did not achieve their full potential according to The ''Los Angeles Times'' reviewer.<ref name=TR/>  ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' magazine describes certain lines as oversalted, but forgivably so.<ref name=LLaWIWTO/>
