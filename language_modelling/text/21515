'''''Beaver''''' was the first [[steamship]] to operate in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]]. She made remote parts of the west coast of Canada accessible for [[Maritime Fur Trade|maritime fur trading]] and was chartered by the [[Royal Navy]] for surveying the coastline of British Columbia.<ref name=VMM/>

==Construction and delivery==
''Beaver'' was built in London of British oak, elm, greenheart and teak, and was copper fastened and sheathed. Her length was {{convert|101|ft|m}}, and the beam over her paddle boxes was {{convert|33|ft|m}}. She was launched at [[Blackwall Yard]] on 9 May 1835 and left London on 29 August under the command of Captain David Home, and with the company's barque, [[Columbia (barque)|''Columbia'']], built at the same time and commanded by Captain Darby. ''Beaver'' was outfitted as a brig for the passage out, paddles unshipped, and came out via Cape Horn under sail alone. After calling at Juan Fernandez and Honolulu, she arrived off the Columbia River on 18 March 1836 and anchored off [[Fort Vancouver]] on 10 April. Here the paddles were shipped and boilers and engines connected.

==Service in Canada==
''Beaver'' was used to service trading posts maintained by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] between the [[Columbia River]] and [[Russian America]] (Alaska) and played an important role in helping maintain British control in [[British Columbia]] during the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]] of 1858-59. In 1862 she was chartered by the [[Royal Navy]] to survey and chart the coast of the [[Colony of British Columbia]].
She also provided assistance to the Royal Navy at Bute Inlet during the [[Chilcotin War]].

Initially she had a rectangular boiler, generating  steam pressure at under 3 psi, and
was fed by seawater. Boulton and Watt engines are not pressure engines, rather they are
vacuum engines. [Salt water feed was common in the early days and could be done
with low pressure and frequent boiler blowdowns to prevent salt scale build up on the plates].  The salt water played havoc with the boilers as the salinity rusted the wall
thickness of the boiler which would rot out. The Beaver had to have a new boiler every seven years or so and went through multiple installations over  her career.
Over time the boiler pressure was upped, and the large 42 inch cylinders were replaced
with 36 inch diameter ones.

The Beaver played roles in the establishment of coal mines at Fort Rupert, and later
in 1853, Nanaimo. The Beaver helped the Hudson's Bay Company establish Fort Victoria
as a post in 1843. It would also ferry dignitaries like the Governor back and forth
between the two colonies of New Caledonia.

In her later life the Beaver burned coal and would hire young Natives of the Squamish nation to work the holds as coal passers. She was finally sold by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1874.

==Loss==

She was purchased by a consortium that became the British Columbia Towing and Transportation Company in 1874<ref name=VMM/> and was used as a towboat until 25 July 1888 when, due to an inebriated crew, she went aground on rocks at [[Prospect Point]] in [[Vancouver]]'s [[Stanley Park]]. The wreck finally sank in July 1892 from the wake of the passing steamer ''Yosemite'', and only after enterprising locals had stripped much of the wreck for souvenirs. The [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]] houses a collection of ''Beaver'' remnants. The site of the sinking has been commemorated with a plaque.  Divers surveyed the wreck in the 1960s, but it had mostly disintegrated due to rot and currents.
