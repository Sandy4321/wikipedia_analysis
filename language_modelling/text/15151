'''[[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''Queen Mary 2''''' is a [[transatlantic crossing|transatlantic]] [[ocean liner]]. She was the first major ocean liner built since {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2|3=2}} in 1969, the vessel she succeeded as [[flagship]] of the [[Cunard Line]]. The ship was named by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2004 after the first {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, completed in 1936.  ''Queen Mary'' was in turn named after [[Mary of Teck]], consort of King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]. With the retirement of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' from active duty in 2008, ''Queen Mary 2'' is currently the only  transatlantic ocean liner in operation as a liner, although the ship is often used for cruising, including an annual world cruise.<ref>[http://www.cunard.com/qe2_cruises.asp Queen Mary 2 Cruises] ''Cunard'' Retrieved 12th December 2009</ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}

At the time of her construction in 2003 by [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]], ''Queen Mary 2'' was the longest, widest and tallest [[passenger ship]] ever built, and with her {{GT|151,400|first=yes|adj=on}}, was also the largest.  She no longer holds this distinction after the construction of [[Royal Caribbean International]]'s {{GT|154,407|adj=on}} {{MS|Freedom of the Seas|3=2}} in April 2006, which was in turn superseded by the same company's {{GT|225,282}} {{MS|Oasis of the Seas|3=2}} in October 2009. However, ''Queen Mary 2'' remains the largest [[ocean liner]] (as opposed to [[cruise ship]]) ever built.

''Queen Mary 2'' was intended primarily to cross the Atlantic Ocean, and was therefore designed differently from many other passenger ships. The ship's final cost was approximately $300,000 US per berth, nearly double that of many contemporary cruise ships.  This was due to the size of the ship, the high quality of materials, and that, having been designed as an ocean liner, she required 40% more steel than a standard cruise ship.<ref name="Sealetter Travel Inc">{{cite web | url = http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-04/qm2.html | title = The History, Construction and Design of ''Queen Mary 2'' | publisher = Sealetter Travel Inc}}</ref> She has a maximum speed of {{convert|29.62|kn|km/h mph|lk=on}} and a cruising speed of {{convert|26|kn|km/h mph|lk=on}}, much faster than contemporary [[cruise ship]]s, such as ''Oasis of the Seas'', which has a cruising speed of {{convert|22.6|kn|km/h mph}}.  Instead of the [[diesel-electric]] configuration found on many ships, ''Queen Mary 2'' uses a CODAG configuration ([[Combined diesel and gas]]) in order to achieve her maximum speed.  This uses additional gas turbines to augment the power given by the diesel generators onboard, and allow the ship to reach a higher maximum speed.

''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s facilities include fifteen restaurants and bars, five swimming pools, a casino, a ballroom, a theatre, and the first [[planetarium]] at sea.  There are also kennels onboard, as well as a nursery. ''Queen Mary 2'' is one of the few ships afloat today to have remnants of a [[class system]] onboard, most prominently seen in her dining options.

==Characteristics==
''Queen Mary 2'' is the current [[flagship]] of the Cunard Line. The ship was constructed to eventually replace the ageing {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2}}, the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before the construction of ''Queen Mary 2''.<ref name="cruiseweb.com">{{cite web |url=http://cruiseweb.com/blog/2009/10/queen-mary-2-becomes-largest-ship-ever-to-visit-the-clyde |title=Queen Mary 2 Becomes Largest Ship Ever to Visit the Clyde |author=Cunard |date=2009-10-23  |work= |publisher=Cruise Web Blog |accessdate=2009-11-23}} /</ref> ''Queen Mary 2'' had the [[Royal Mail Ship]] (RMS) title conferred on her, as a gesture to Cunard's history, by [[Royal Mail]] when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route.<ref>{{cite news | title = Royal Mail employee's Courier newspaper | publisher = Royal Mail | date = August 2007}}</ref>

''Queen Mary 2'' is not a [[steamship]] like many of her predecessors, but is powered primarily by four [[diesel engine]]s with two additional [[gas turbine]]s which are used when extra power is required; this [[CODAG]] configuration is used to produce the power to drive her four electric propulsion pods as well as powering the ship's hotel services. Like her predecessor ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' she is built for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, though she is regularly used for cruising purposes; in the winter season she cruises from New York to the Caribbean on ten or thirteen day tours. ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph|adj=on}} open ocean speed sets the ship apart from cruise ships, such as ''Oasis of the Seas'', which has an average speed of {{convert|22.6|kn|km/h mph}}; ''QM2''{{'}}s normal service speed is {{convert|26|kn|km/h mph|adj=off}}.<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical">{{cite web |url=http://www.cunard.com/uploads/QM2Technical.pdf|title=Queen Mary 2 Technical|accessdate=2009-11-07 |work= |publisher=Cunard}}</ref>

==Design and construction==
[[Image:QM2-1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Queen Mary 2'' under construction, her [[radar]] [[mast (sailing)|mast]] in the right foreground]]
Cunard completed a design for a new class of {{GT|84,000}}, 2,000 passenger liners on 8 June 1998, but revised them upon comparing those specifications with [[Carnival Cruise Lines]]' {{GT|100,000}} [[Destiny class cruise ship|''Destiny'' class]] cruise ships and [[Royal Caribbean International]]'s {{GT|137,200}} [[Voyager class cruise ship|''Voyager'' class]].<ref name="Great Ocean Liners"/>

In December 1998, Cunard released details of ''Project Queen Mary'', the project to develop a liner that would complement ''Queen Elizabeth 2''. [[Harland and Wolff]] of [[Northern Ireland]], [[Aker Kv<U+00E6>rner]] of [[Norway]], [[Fincantieri]] of [[Italy]], [[Meyer Werft]] of [[Germany]], and [[Chantiers de l'Atlantique]] of [[France]] were invited to bid on the project.  The contract was finally signed with Chantiers de l'Atlantique, a subsidiary of [[Alstom]], on 6 November 2000.  This was the same yard that built Cunard's former rivals, the {{SS|Normandie}} and {{SS|France|1961|6}} of the [[Compagnie G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale Transatlantique]].<ref name="Great Ocean Liners">{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/qm2.html|title=Queen Mary 2|accessdate=2009-11-07 |work= |publisher=The Great Ocean Liners}}</ref>

Her [[keel]] was laid down in the [[Louis Joubert Lock]] on 4 July 2002, in [[Saint-Nazaire]], France, with the hull number ''G32''. Approximately 3,000 craftsmen spent around eight million working hours on the ship, and around 20,000 people were directly or indirectly involved in her design, construction, and fitting out.  In total, 300,000 pieces of steel were assembled into 94 "blocks" off of the drydock, which were then stacked and welded together to complete the hull and superstructure.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldshipny.com/qm2pt1.htm | title = Construction of the Largest Liner in the World, Part One, July 4, 2002 ~ March 16, 2003 | publisher = World Ship Society | accessdate = 2009-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080419083557/http://www.worldshipny.com/qm2pt1.htm |archivedate = April 19, 2008}}</ref>  

''Queen Mary 2'' was [[float out|floated]] on 21 March 2003. Her sea trials were conducted between 25 September-29 September and 7<U+2013>11 November 2003,<ref>{{cite book | title = Queen Mary 2: The Birth of a Legend | author = Plisson, Philip | publisher = Harry N. Abrams, Inc | year = 2004}}</ref> between Saint-Nazaire and the offshore islands of [[Ile d'Yeu]] and Belle-Ile. The final stages of construction were marred by a fatal accident on 15 November 2003, when a gangway collapsed under a group of shipyard workers and their relatives who had been invited to visit the vessel.  In total, 32 people were injured and 16 were killed, after a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} fall into the drydock.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20031116/quennmary2gangwaycollapse_20031116?s_name=&no_ads= | publisher = CTV News | title = Toll climbs in Queen Mary 2 shipyard accident'' | date = 2003-11-16}}</ref>  

Construction was completed on schedule.  The ship's final cost was approximately $300,000 US per berth, nearly double that of many large passenger ships.  This was due to the size of the ship, the high quality of materials, and that, having been designed as an ocean liner, she required 40% more steel than a standard cruise ship.<ref name="Sealetter Travel Inc"/>  Cunard took delivery in [[Southampton, England]] on 26 December 2003.  On 8 January 2004, the liner was named by her namesake's granddaughter, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3375225.stm|title=Queen launches Queen Mary 2|publisher=BBC|date=2004-01-08}}{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref><ref>Davidson, Carla.

''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s principal naval architect was [[Carnival Corporation & plc|Carnival]]'s house designer, [[Stephen Payne (designer)|Stephen Payne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cunard.co.uk/news/default.asp?Cat=&View=ViewArticle&Mode=Archive&ContentID=7307&main= |title=Cunard press pack:''Future Engineers 2008'' |author= |date=October 2008 |work= |publisher=Cunard |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>  Payne intended many aspects of the ship's design to resemble notable aspects of former ocean liners, such as ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' and the ship's predecessor ''Queen Mary''.  These features include the three thick black lines that wrap around either edge of the ship's bridge screen, and at the stern end of the superstructure, which are to recall the appearance of the crossovers of the forward decks on the first ''Queen Mary''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Queen May 2:The Greatest Ocean Liner of our Time |last=Maxtone-Graham |first=John |authorlink=John Maxtone-Graham |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Bulfinch Press |location= |isbn= 0-8212-2885-4|page=22 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>

''Queen Mary 2'' has {{convert|14164|m2|acre|adj=on}} of exterior deck space, with wind screens to shield passengers as the ship travels at high speeds.  Four of the ship's five swimming pools are outdoors (although one of these is only one inch deep for use by small children).  One of the pools on Deck 12 is covered with a retractable [[magrodome]]. The indoor pool is on Deck 7, in the Canyon Ranch Spa Club.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cruiseweb.com/CUNARD-QUEEN-MARY-2.HTM |title="Queen Mary 2 of Cunard Line" |author= |date= |work= |publisher=www.cruiseweb.com |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

In common with liners such as {{SS|Rotterdam}}, there is a continuous wrap around [[promenade deck]] on Deck 7.  The promenade passes behind the bridge screen and allows passengers to completely circumnavigate the deck while protected from the strong winds generated by the ship at full speed.  One circuit of the promenade is a distance of {{convert|620|m|-1|abbr=on}}.  The flanking promenades are created by the need to step the [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] in, to allow for space for [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s.  By [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]] standards the lifeboats should have been lower on the ship's hull ({{convert|15|m|0|abbr=on}} above the waterline), but for the sake of ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s appearance as well as to avoid the danger of large North Atlantic waves damaging the boats in a storm, Payne convinced SOLAS officials to exempt the ''Queen Mary 2'' from this requirement, and the boats are {{convert|25|m|0|abbr=on}} above the waterline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cybercruises.com/queenmary2two.htm  |title=''Queen Mary 2''  |author=Arturo Paniagua Mazorra  |date=September 14, 2004 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>
 
Payne's initial intent was to make the ship's stern profile with a spoon shape, similar to that on most previous ocean liners, but the mounting of the [[azimuth thruster|propeller pods]] required a flat [[transom (nautical)|transom]].  The compromise was a [[Constanzi stern]] <U+2013> a combination of the two.  The final design was agreed upon, as a Constanzi stern provides the transom required for azimuthal pod propulsors, and provides better seaholding characteristics in a following swell than a standard transom stern.<ref>{{cite book |title=Queen May 2:The Greatest Ocean Liner of our Time |last=Maxtone-Graham|first=John |authorlink=John Maxtone-Graham|coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Bulfinch Press |location= |isbn= 0-8212-2885-4|page=21 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>  In common with many modern ships, both passenger and cargo, ''Queen Mary 2'' has a [[bulbous bow]] to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]] and thereby increase speed, range, and [[fuel efficiency]].<ref name="professional mariner">[http://www.professionalmariner.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=420C4D38DC9C4E3A903315CDDC65AD72&nm=Archives&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=B01E9F24E41844049504B323C52C78FB "Queen Mary 2:] Built to keep alive the traditions of the great ocean liners" ''Professional Mariner'' (2003) Retrieved 11 December 2009</ref>

While of a similar design to that of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s funnel was designed with a slightly different shape.  The difference was required because, due to the height of the vessel, a taller funnel would have made it impossible for the ship to pass under the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York City]] at high tide.  The final design now permits a minimum of {{convert|13|ft|m}} of clearance under the bridge at high tide.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=This Ship Is So Big, The Verrazano Cringes|newspaper=The New York Times|publication-place=New York, NY|date=18 April 2004|month=April|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E7DC103BF93BA25757C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink+|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

As ''Queen Mary 2'' is too large to dock in many ports, passengers are ferried to and from the ship in built [[Ship's tender|tenders]], which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency.  While at sea, these are stored in [[davit]]s alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore, the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, which each have a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical"/>

''Queen Mary 2'' is a [[post-panamax]] ship. As a result, the ''Queen Mary 2'' must circumnavigate South America in order to cross between the Atlantic and Pacific. The decision not to constrain her size in order to transit the [[Panama Canal]] was taken as the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' only transited once a year, during the world cruise. Cunard decided to pass up the convenience of the occasional passage in favour of a larger passenger capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wearecunard.com/2009/01/transiting-the-panama-canal-%E2%80%93-from-east-to-west-or-west-to-east/ |title=Transiting the panama canal-- From East to West or West to East? |author=Alistair Greener |date=January 22, 2009 |work= |publisher=Cunard (blog) |accessdate=2009-11-23}}</ref>

===Interior===
[[Image:QM2 Brooklyn Cruise jeh.JPG|thumb|QM2 tied up at Pier 12]]
As is the case with many modern passenger ships, many of the major public rooms onboard ''Queen Mary 2'' are on the lowest public decks of the ship, with the passenger cabins stacked above.<ref name="Cunard:QM2 Deck Plans"/>  This is the opposite of the traditional practice on ocean liners, but the design allowed for larger rooms to be contained within the stronger hull, as well as for more passenger cabins to have private balconies higher up on the ship, where they are less affected by large waves.  Payne attempted to create a central axis to the two main public room decks (similar in fashion to the ''Normandie''), but a full vista is broken by various public rooms that span the full beam of the ship.  The dining rooms were placed further aft, though not directly at the stern, where the fore and aft [[Tait-Bryan angles|pitching]] of the ship is most noticeable, and where vibration from the propellers at full speed might cause discomfort to dining passengers.<ref>[http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:92hA4yU9gRcJ:w2.mki.gov.hu/itk/fay_reka/private_documents/webquests/szeptemberi/nyugat-mo/Csisz%C3%A1rZs.Queen%2520Mary%25202.jav.doc+queen+mary+2+propeller+vibration+dining+rooms&cd=17&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us "Introduction of the Royal Mail Ship Queen Mary 2"] Zsolt Csisz<U+00E1>r; retrieved 22nd November 2009

Deck 2, the lowest passenger deck, contains the Illuminations theatre, cinema and planetarium (the first at sea);<ref name="Todd English">[http://www.cunard.com/uploads/QM2ToddEnglish.pdf QM2 Todd English] ''Cunard'' "Queen Mary 2 Features Only Shipboard Restaurant By Celebrity Chef Todd English" Retrieved 12th December</ref> Royal Court Theatre; Grand Lobby; "Empire Casino"; "Golden Lion Pub"; and the lower level of the "Britannia Restaurant". Deck 3 holds the upper levels of "Illuminations", the "Royal Court theatre" and the "Britannia Restaurant", as well as a small shopping arcade, "Veuve Cliquot champagne bar", the "Chart Room", "Sir Samuel's" wine bar, the "Queen's Room", and the "G32" Nightclub.  The other main public deck is Deck 7, on which are the "Canyon Ranch Spa", "Winter Garden", "King's Court", the "Queen's Grill Lounge", and the "Queen's Grill" and "Princess Grill" restaurants for higher-fare passengers.  The public rooms on Deck 8 include the [[<U+00E0> la carte]] [[Todd&nbsp;English]] Restaurant,<ref name="Todd English"/> a library, a book shop and the upper part of the Canyon Ranch Spa.

[[Image:Queen Mary 2 07 KMJ.jpg|thumb|QM2 leaving Hamburg]]
The King's Court area on the ship is open twenty four hours a day, serving as a buffet restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The overall space is divided into quarters, with each section decorated according to the theme of the four separate alternate dining venues that are "created" each evening through lighting, tableware, and menus: Lotus, which specialises in [[Asian cuisine]]; the Carvery, a British style grille; La Piazza, with [[Italian cuisine|Italian food]]; and the Chef's Galley, which offers an interactive experience to food preparation.<ref>[http://cunard.com/OurShips/default.asp?Ship=Queen Mary 2&main=din&sub=#Kings Cunard Line: Queen Mary 2: King's Court]</ref><ref>[http://www.sealetter.com/Jun-04/qm2.html Mazorra, Arturo Paniagua; ''Sealetter Cruise Magazine'': The History, Construction and Design of Queen Mary 2]</ref>

The passengers' dining arrangements onboard are dictated by which 'class' of accommodation they choose to travel in.  Most  passengers (around 85%) are in ''Britannia'' class (and therefore dine in the main restaurant).  However, passengers can choose to upgrade to either a 'junior suite' (and dine in the "Princess Grill"'), or a suite (and dine in the "Queens' Grill").<ref>[http://www.cunard.com/uploads/QM2FactSheet.pdf ''Cunard'':QM2 Fact Sheet]</ref><ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/gaynor/2005-08-16-column_x.htm Gaynor, Louisa Frey; ''USA Today'': The Queen (Mary 2) rules the Atlantic; August 16, 2005]</ref>  Those in the two latter categories are grouped together by Cunard as "Grill Passengers", and they are permitted to use the "Queens' Grill Lounge" and a private outdoor area on deck 11 with its own whirlpool.<ref name="Cunard:QM2 Deck Plans"/><ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'' "Queen Mary 2 Liverpool visit: The ship that offers her passengers <U+2018>trip of a lifetime<U+2019>" October 21, 2009</ref> This feature is also present on both the ''Queen Victoria'' and the ''Queen Elizabeth''.  However, all other public areas can be used by all passengers.

As the Britannia Restaurant takes up the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow passengers to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2.  This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull.  This arrangement is illustrated on the hull where there is a stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L.  There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre.  As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.<ref name="Cunard:QM2 Deck Plans"/>

More than 5000 commissioned works of art are visible in the ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s public rooms, corridors, staterooms and lobbies, having been created by 128 artists from sixteen different countries.<ref>[http://www.nqsouthern.com/digitalpublication/digitalpublications/index.cfm?dpid=89&section_id=547&article_id=1566 The art of cruising in luxury]</ref>  Two of the most notable pieces are Barbara Broekman's [[tapestry]], an abstract depiction of an ocean liner, bridge, and New York skyline which spans the full height of the Britannia Restaurant, and John McKenna's sheet bronze relief [[mural]] in the Grand Lobby, inspired by the Art Deco mural in the main dining room of the original ''Queen Mary''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onk.nl/en/qm2.htm  |title=Queen Mary 2 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Onderneming & Kunst |accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref>

''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s power plant comprises both four sixteen [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] [[W<U+00E4>rtsil<U+00E4>]] 16V46CR ''EnviroEngine'' marine [[diesel engines]] generating a combined {{convert|67200|kW|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} at 514 rpm, as well as two [[General Electric LM2500|General Electric LM2500+]] [[gas turbines]] which together provide a further {{convert|50000|kW|hp|abbr=on}}. Such a combined arrangement, known as [[CODAG]] (Combined Diesel And Gas turbine), provides for economical cruising at low speed combined with an ability to sustain much higher speeds when required, and has been common in [[naval ship|naval vessels]] for some time.<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical"/>  While ''Queen Mary 2'' is the first passenger ship to feature CODAG propulsion, the first major passenger vessel to be powered by gas turbines was the Finnish ferry ''[[Finnjet]]'' in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finnjet.fi/ |title=Finnjet historical society Homepage |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>

Thrust is provided by four [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] Mermaid podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward facing low vibration [[Kamewa]] [[propeller]] with separately bolted blades.  ''Queen Mary 2'' carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.  The forward pair are fixed, but the aft pair can [[azimuth thruster|rotate]] through 360<U+00B0>, removing the need for a [[rudder]].<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical"/> The ''Queen Mary 2'' is the first quadruple propeller passenger ship completed since the SS ''France'' in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |title=Enso-Gutzeit Oy laivanvarustajana: Oy Finnlines Ltd ja Merivienti Oy 1947-1982 |last=Karonen |first=Petri |year=1992 |publisher=Enso-Gutzeit |location=Imatra |isbn=952-9690-00-2 |pages=106<U+2013>109 |url= |language=Finnish }}</ref>

[[Image:QM2-propeller-spares.jpg|thumb|200px|Three of the eight spare propeller blades mounted on the foredeck.]]
As in most modern passenger ships, ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s propulsion machinery is electrically decoupled from her propellers and her propulsion arrangement can therefore be more accurately described as "CODAG electric" (by analogy with [[turbo-electric]] and [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]]). The diesel engines and gas turbines drive [[electrical generator]]s, which provide the power to drive four {{convert|21500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Alstom]] [[electric motor|electrical motors]] located inside the podded propulsors (and thus entirely outside the vessel's hull).<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical"/>  Unusually, ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s gas turbines are not housed along with her diesels in the [[engine room]] deep in her hull, but instead reside in a soundproofed enclosure directly underneath the funnel.  This arrangement allowed the vessel's designers to supply the oxygen hungry turbines with air intakes without having to run air ducts the entire height of the ship, which would have wasted valuable interior space.<ref name="Queen Mary 2 Technical"/>

=== Water supply ===

Freshwater aboard ''Queen Mary 2'' is supplied primarily by three seawater [[desalination]] plants. The plants, each with a capacity of 630,000 litres per day, use multiple effect plate (MEP) distillation technology. The plants<U+2019> energy is supplied primarily by steam and cooling water from the ship<U+2019>s gas turbines and diesel engines, or if needed by steam from the ship<U+2019>s two oil fired boilers. The traditional [[multiple-effect distillation]] technology has been improved for the ship<U+2019>s plant, so that [[Fouling#Micro fouling|scaling]] of plates is reduced, vastly reducing maintenance required. The desalinated water has a very low salt content of less than five parts per million. Average total water production is 1,100 tons per day with a capacity of 1,890 m<U+00B3> so that there is ample spare capacity. The ship could easily be supplied by only two of the three plants.<ref name="Alstom">{{cite book | title= Queen Mary 2. The Genesis of a Queen. Alstom Chantiers de l<U+2019>Atlantique, A Publication of the Naval Architect | year = 2004 | pages = 50<U+2013>55.}}</ref> Potable water tanks have a capacity of 3,830,000 litres, enough for more than three days of supply.<ref name="QM2tecspec">Cunard. RMS Queen Mary 2 Technical Specification. Flyer made available to passengers of the QM2.</ref> If the engines are running on low load (when the ship is running at a slow speed) the engine jacket cooling water temperature is insufficient to heat the seawater to run the desalination plants. In that case, steam which is generated in oil fired boilers is used to heat the sea water.  This is uneconomical as generating steam is an expensive process. Therefore, it may be cheaper to buy water on shore in a particular port than to produce it onboard. The seawater intakes are located in the hull of the ship. Concentrated salt solution ([[brine]]) is discharged to the sea closer to the ship<U+2019>s stern together with cooling water from the engines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infotechfrance.com/cgi-local/affichage_signet_secteur.pl?UNI_ID=8&RUB_ID=54&SS_ID=6746&SEC_ID=25 |title=UBIFRANCE Orelis<U+2019> technology to recycle Queen Mary 2<U+2019>s waste water |author= |date=16 April 2004  |work= |publisher= |accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref>

On 12 January 2004 ''Queen Mary 2'' set sail on her [[maiden voyage]] from [[Southampton]], [[England]], to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in the [[United States]], carrying 2,620 passengers under the command of captain Ronald Warwick, who had previously commanded ''Queen Elizabeth 2''. Warwick is the son of William (Bil) Warwick who had also been a senior Cunard officer and the first captain of ''Queen Elizabeth 2''. The ship arrived in Southampton late from her maiden voyage after bow doors which covered the thrusters failed to shut in [[Portugal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/passengers-threaten-mutiny-on-crippled-queen-mary-2-524177.html |title=Passengers threaten mutiny on crippled 'Queen Mary 2' |author=Elaine Barker |date=23 January 2006 |work= |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref>

One 2005 transatlantic crossing saw ''Queen Mary 2'' carrying, in a locked steamer trunk, the first US copy of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s book ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', autographed by the author. In a promotional press release for the event, Cunard said (though without cited verification) that this marked the first time a book had been transported to its international launch aboard an ocean liner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&View=ViewArticle&Mode=News&ContentID=5160&Page=3 |title=World's most famous ocean liner carries first J.K.

In January 2006 ''Queen Mary 2'' embarked on a circumnavigation of [[South America]] as the ship is [[Post-Panamax|too large]] to pass through the [[Panama Canal]].  Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale one of her [[azimuth thruster|propeller pod]]s was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a [[sit in]] protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. The ''Queen Mary 2'' continued to operate at a reduced service speed, and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where ''Queen Mary 2'' paid a visit to dry dock, and the damaged propeller pod was unseated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/28/nmutiny28.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/01/28/ixnewstop.html |title=Cunard foils QM2 mutiny with full refund offer |author=Andrew Downe; Amy Iggulden |date=28 Jan 2006 |work= |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=2009-11-26}}</ref> In November ''Queen Mary 2'' was dry-docked once more at the [[Blohm + Voss]] yard in [[Hamburg]] (drydock [[Elbe 17]]) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod.  At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS ''[[Star Princess]]'' fire.  Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blohmvoss-repair.com/pdf/buv_rep_allg_in.pdf|title=Blohmvoss Repair Schedule-2006|publisher=Blohmvoss|date=}}</ref>

====The Boston Cup====
Carried aboard ''QM2'' is the Boston Cup. Sometimes referred to as The Britannia Cup, this artifact was created for [[Sir Samuel Cunard]] in [[Boston]] to commemorate the arrival of his first vessel {{RMS|Britannia}}.<ref name=chrisboston>{{cite web |url=http://www.chriscunard.com/boston_cup.php |title=The Boston Cup |work=Chris' Cunard Page |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> Cunard had selected Boston as the American port for his Atlantic service, which resulted in a strong connection between Boston and the Cunard Line.<ref>{{cite book |title=Queen May 2:The Greatest Ocean Liner of our Time |last=Maxtone-Graham |first=John |authorlink=John Maxtone-Graham |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Bulfinch Press |location= |isbn= 0-8212-2885-4|page= |pages=46<U+2013>49 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>  It is believed that the cup was presented to Sir Samuel Cunard sometime in 1840; however, for much of its life it was missing. It was discovered in an antique shop in 1967 and returned to Cunard, where it was placed aboard ''Queen Elizabeth 2''. In 2004, when ''QM2'' became flagship, the Boston Cup was placed aboard ''QM2'' as a symbol of her being Cunard's flagship.<ref name=chrisboston />  It is in a glass case aft of the Chart Room lounge.<ref>[http://wearecunard.com/2009/07/cunard-celebrates-a-special-anniversary/ Cunard Celebrates a Special Anniversary]</ref>

====Repeated Propulsion Failures====
The [[Rolls Royce]] Mermaid propulsor pods fitted to ''QM2'' have proven to be prone to repeated failure.  The failure had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009.  The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship ''Queen Mary 2'' are inherently defective in design.  Cunard contend that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract.  The Achilles heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings which continue to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign.<ref name="fail">{{cite web |url=http://www.ebearing.com/news2009/011601.htm |title=Specifications:Carnival Sues Rolls-Royce Over Queen Mary... |accessdate=2011-01-19 |date=2009-01-16}}</ref>In January 2011 Carnival Corporation has been awarded US$24 million (approx.

== Environmental performance ==
{{See also|Cruise ship pollution}}

When designing ''Queen Mary 2'', the designers aimed to reduce the ship's impact on the environment by improving fuel efficiency, and through better management of waste, not only to reduce fuel costs, but also to increase the service life of the ship, as it was predicted that tighter environmental regulations would be implemented while the ship was in service. Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as in order to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. However, ''Queen Mary 2''{{'}}s environmental performance exceeds that of many older ships, as well as international standards on waste, as detailed further below.<ref name="professional mariner"/><ref name="QM2tecspec"/>

According to Cunard, the ship exceeds the requirements of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships ([[MARPOL]]) of the [[International Maritime Organization]]. For example, it discharges waste into the sea only in areas more than {{convert|12|nmi|mi|abbr=on}} from any coast, although MARPOL allows discharge of treated organic waste and treated bilge water closer to the shore.  Discharges of potentially harmful substances, in particular the residual oil content of treated bilge water and air emissions, are monitored regularly in order to ensure compliance with environmental standards.<ref name="QM2tecspec"/>  In areas where air pollution from [[sulfur dioxide]] which causes [[acid rain]] is a concern, the ship switches to low-sulphur fuel in order to minimize air pollution.<ref name="QM2tecspec"/>

According to the [[carbon offset]] company [[Climate Care]], per passenger mile, passenger ships release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than long haul flights.  However, Cunard attempted to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of ''Queen Mary 2'' by improving engine efficiency and reducing friction while the ship is in motion.  In November 2008, the ship was given a refit in [[Hamburg]], part of which involved the repainting of the hull in paint which is designed to reduce drag, and thus improve fuel economy.<ref name="QM2tecspec"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wearecunard.com/tag/hamburg/ |title=Queen Mary dry dock report |author=Alistair Greener |date=12 November 2008 |work= |publisher=Cunard (blog) |accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2006/dec/20/cruises.green |title=Is cruising any greener than flying? |author= |date=20 December 2006 |work= |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref>
