The '''''Stork Club''''' was a [[nightclub]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], which during its existence from 1929 to 1965 was one of the most prestigious clubs in the world. A symbol of [[caf<U+00E9> society]], the wealthy elite, including movie stars, celebrities, [[showgirl]]s, and aristocrats all mixed in the VIP Cub Room of the club.

The club was established on West 58th Street in 1929 by [[Sherman Billingsley]], a former bootlegger from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by [[Mad Dog Coll]], a rival of his mobster partners, he became the sole owner of the ''Stork Club''. The club remained at its original location until it was raided by [[Prohibition]] agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East [[53rd Street (Manhattan)|53rd Street]], just east of [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]], when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury. Billingsley was known for his lavish gifts, which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested in the famous would have a reason to visit.

Until World War II, the club consisted of a dining room and bar with rest rooms on upper floors with many mirrors and fresh flowers throughout.  Billingsley originally built the well-known Cub Room as a private place where he could play cards with friends.  Described as a "lopsided oval", the room had wood paneled walls hung with portraits of beautiful women and had no windows.  A head waiter known as "Saint Peter" determined who was allowed entry to the Cub Room, where Walter Winchell wrote his columns and broadcast his radio programs from Table 50.

During the years of its operation, the club was visited by many political, social and celebrity figures.  It counted among its guests the Kennedy and Roosevelt families, and The Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The news of Grace Kelly's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke while the couple was visiting the ''Stork Club''. Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the Hope Diamond, once lost the gem under a ''Stork Club'' table during an evening visit to the club. Ernest Hemingway was able to cash his $100,000 check for the film rights of ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' at the ''Stork Club'' to settle his bill.

In the 1940s, workers of the ''Stork Club'' desired to be represented by a union, and by 1957, the employees of all similar New York venues were union members. However, Billingsley was still unwilling to allow his help to organize, which led to union supporters picketing in front of the club for many years until its closure.  During this time, many of the club's celebrity and non-celebrity guests stopped visiting the ''Stork Club''; it closed in 1965 and was demolished the following year. The site is now the location of [[Paley Park]], a small [[pocket park|vest-pocket park]].

In early 1944, New York mayor [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] ordered a check on the books of all major city night clubs. City tax accountants soon investigated the ''Stork Club'', the ''[[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabama]]'' and other city night spots. By July, auditors turned in a report claiming that the clubs were overcharging patrons on tax, sending the city the proper amount and keeping the overbilled sums. On a Saturday in July, city officials arrived at the ''Stork Club'' with a court order granting permission for them to seize the club's property for the amount which was claimed to be overcharged as taxes, plus penalties.  The total for the ''Stork Club'' was $181,000. Billingsley, out of town with his family, was notified.  The club's employees refused to turn anything over to the officials, who were intent on closing it. Upon his return, Billingsley firmly protested that the ''Stork Club'' did not owe the city any money and was up to date on its tax payments. A compromise was reached: the club could stay open as long as a custodian for the city was allowed to be on the premises. Billingsley was eventually able to get a court order to eject the custodian, but the case dragged on for five years, costing Billingsley $100,000.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2003|pp=26-29}}<ref name=sclub>{{cite news|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/1767337/obit/|title=Billingsley, Stork Club Owner, Dies|date=October 4, 1966|page=3|newspaper=[[La Crosse Tribune]]|accessdate=February 12, 2015|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref>

A New York police investigation of the matter followed the complaint made by the NAACP.  The police investigation found that the ''Stork Club'' did not discriminate against Josephine Baker.

Because of Billingsley's long-standing friendship with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) head J. Edgar Hoover, rumors persisted that the ''Stork Club'' was bugged. During his work on the ''Stork Club'' book, author and ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by [[Jean-Claude Baker]], one of Josephine Baker's sons. Having read an article by Blumenthal about [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s FBI file, he indicated that he had read his mother's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes, said he thought the ''Stork Club'' incident was overblown.<ref name="Society">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/nydn-features/stork-club-special-delivery-exhibit-new-york-historical-society-recalls-glamour-wind-article-1.873537|title=Stork Club Special Delivery Exhibit at the New York Historical Society recalls a glamour gone with the wind|author=Kissel, Howard|date=May 3, 2000|accessdate=August 29, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]}}</ref>

Author T. C.

It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk".{{Sfn|Duecy|2013}} The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the ''Stork Club'', according to journalist Ed Sullivan, was people watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities.<ref name="Sullivan"/> Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that "many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time", and the likes of [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Lucille Ball]] could often be seen conversing with executive types.{{sfn|Allen|1980|p=148}} Mark Bernardo, author of ''Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide'', has said: "In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time<U+2014>courting celebrities by picking up their tabs, hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names".{{sfn|Bernardo|2010|p=33}} The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could take a long time to be dealt with.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|p=16}}

Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girl friend, vocalist Gigi Durston on the basis of the couple's friends' statements that they were going to be married.  Durston had once worked at the ''Stork Club'' as a singer and Roosevelt was a long-time customer of the club.  Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time. Elliott Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled.<ref name=Elliott/> [[Jackie Gleason]], who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters, was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957. Billingsley claimed that Gleason's conversation became loud and off-color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the ''Stork Club'' for life.  Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong. He wondered if the problem was because he was a member of the Musicians' Union, since the club's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year.<ref name=Gleason/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19570305&id=MkEaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OSMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6886,2809637|page=5|newspaper=[[The Times-News]]|date=March 5, 1957|title=Report Gleason Ejected From Stork Club|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> 

Despite the rules and banishments, there were incidents which made their way into newspapers. Billingsley associate Steve Hannagan believed that one "good fight" a year was permissible for a respectable night club. [[Johnny Weissmuller]] accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table. The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape-men. The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller.  Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back; knocking him into three chairs and a table as he brushed him away. Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press.<ref name=inside/> 

[[Jack Benny]] invited long-time friend, writer and performer [[Goodman Ace]] to lunch with him at the Stork. Ace arrived at the club first and received the "[[cold shoulder]]" because he was not recognized by the staff. When Benny arrived and asked for Ace, he was told that Ace became tired of waiting and left. Soon Ace began to receive mail from the Stork, which he proceeded to answer in his tongue in cheek style.  Ace's response to the message about the club having wonderful air conditioning was that after having received the cold shoulder there, he was well aware of the climate. Bilingsley responded to Ace with a gift of some ''Stork Club'' bow ties. Ace then asked for some matching socks so he might be in style to be turned away again. Ace and his wife became regulars at the club after the issue was resolved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6lgbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1569,2567585&dq=goodman+ace&hl=en|title=Easy Ace Is Not So Easy|author=Steinhauser, Si|date=January 28, 1945|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uQoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V-cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6040,329220&dq=stork+club+air+conditioning&hl=en|title=Ace of Aces Gives Stork Club the Bird|last1=Wilson |first1=Earl |authorlink1=Earl Wilson (columnist)|date=November 2, 1944|newspaper=The Miami News|accessdate=September 23, 2010}}</ref>
