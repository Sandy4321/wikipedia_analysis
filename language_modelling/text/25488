=== Early career (2000<U+2013>2005) ===
In 2000, Minella debuted for the [[Luxembourg Fed Cup team]], partnering Celine Francois in the doubles matches against [[Ukraine Fed Cup team|Ukraine]] and [[Great Britain Fed Cup team|Great Britain]], losing both times. After again participating in Fed Cup in 2001 (where she won her first rubber), she began competing on the [[ITF Women's Circuit]] in the same year. In 2002, she received a qualifying wildcard into the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Tier III [[BGL Luxembourg Open|SEAT Open Luxembourg]], losing the first round.<ref name="ITF">{{ITF female profile|35012612|Mandy Minella}}</ref> She reached her first

=== 2012 ===
[[File:Mandy Minella (LUX).jpg|left|thumb|Minella at the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|2012 US Open]]]]
In 2012, Minella played her first Australian Open main draw. She was given direct entry, being ranked world number 110. She lost to American qualifier [[Jamie Hampton]] in the first round. She then went on to reach the final of a $100,000 ITF tournament in [[Cali]]. Despite defeating number one seed and world number 56 [[Marina Erakovic]] along the way, she lost the final to second seed [[Alexandra Dulgheru]]. She fared better in doubles, winning the title with [[Karin Knapp]]. As a result of her perforances, Minella broke into the top-100 singles rankings for the first time. She then played at the [[2012 Copa Sony Ericsson Colsanitas]], losing in the first round. She reached the final in doubles; her first WTA final of any kind. At the [[2012 Monterrey Open]], she faced Frenchwoman [[Mathilde Johansson]] and won in three sets. She followed this up with a win over Kazakhstani wildcard [[Yaroslava Shvedova]] in a tight three-setter. Minella lost to second seed [[Sara Errani]] in her first WTA quarterfinal.

=== 2013 ===
[[File:Mandy Minella - BNP Paribas Katowice Open 2013.jpg|right|thumb|Minella at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Katowice Open]]]]
In 2013, Minella started her season at the [[2013 Shenzhen Open]], where she faced first seed [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] but lost in straight sets. She then played the [[2013 Moorilla Hobart International]] where she qualified for the main draw but lost to [[Monica Niculescu]] in the first round. In the doubles event she partnered [[T<U+00ED>mea Babos]] and went on to reach the final after the pair saved multiple match points in their first round match. They eventually lost to [[Garbi<U+00F1>e Muguruza]] and [[Mar<U+00ED>a Teresa Torr<U+00F3> Flor]] in the final. Minella then continued her disappointing run of first round losses where she lost to [[Valeria Savinykh]] in the first round of the [[2013 Australian Open]]. She partnered [[Megan Moulton-Levy]] in the doubles event and also saved multiple match points in their first round match, eventually going on to win. The pair then lost, however, in the second round. Minella then played the [[2013 Open GDF Suez]] but suffered a first round loss in qualifying and another first round loss in doubles. She then went to play in the [[2013 Copa Colsanitas]] where she had more positive results, reaching the quarterfinals in singles, beating [[Tatjana Malek]] and T<U+00ED>mea Babos before losing to [[Teliana Pereira]]. In the doubles event Minella again partnered Babos, going on to win the title; her first on the WTA tour. The pair did not drop a set all week.

Minella went on to play the [[2013 Abierto Mexicano Telcel]] but lost to [[Silvia Soler Espinosa]] in the first round. She then lost out to [[Olga Govortsova]] at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open]] in a tight three-setter. At the [[2013 Sony Open Tennis]] Minella lost in qualifying to junior player [[Kate<U+0159>ina Siniakov<U+00E1>]]. In the doubles event she played with Babos once more, with the pair putting up a fight against the first seeds [[Sara Errani]] and [[Roberta Vinci]] in the second round, but it wasn't enough to advance. Minella then suffered another first round loss at the [[2013 Family Circle Cup]] to Italian [[Camila Giorgi]]. At the [[2013 BNP Paribas Katowice Open|Katowice Open]], Minella defeated [[Vesna Dolonc]] in the first round before falling to the first seed [[Petra Kvitov<U+00E1>]]. Minella then went on to play the [[2013 Grand Prix SAR La Princesse Lalla Meryem|Marrakech Grand Prix]], where she defeated [[Estrella Cabeza Candela]] in the first round, fourth seed [[Kaia Kanepi]] in the second, and Soler Espinosa in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals she lost to [[Lourdes Dom<U+00ED>nguez Lino]]; but won the doubles event with T<U+00ED>mea Babos.

Minella then continued her season playing an ITF tournament in France where she lost to Cabeza Candela in the quarterfinals. She played the [[2013 French Open]], suffering first round losses in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Minella then had a string of first round losses, including at the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]] to the world number one, [[Serena Williams]]. At the [[2013 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] she lost to [[Sloane Stephens]] in a tight match where she lost in a final set tiebreak, having been up a break in the third set.

Due to not being able to defend her third round points from the 2012 US Open, Minella's rank dropped to 132. Her next tournament would be the [[2013 Tashkent Open|Tashkent Open]], where she reached the semifinals in singles and was runner-up, partnering [[Olga Govortsova]], in doubles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wort.lu/de/view/kein-dritter-doppel-titel-fuer-mandy-minella-52347349e4b090b6357d2b34|title=Kein dritter Doppel-Titel f<U+00FC>r Mandy Minella|work=[[Luxemburger Wort]]|date=14 September 2013|accessdate=5 October 2013|language=German}}</ref>
