A dog breed is represented by a sufficient number of individuals to stably transfer its specific characteristics over generations.  Purebred  dogs of same breed have similar characteristics of appearance and behavior, primarily because they come from a select set of ancestors who had the same characteristics <ref name="isbn0764573020 ">{{cite book |author=Donna L.

== History of Dog Breeds ==
Aboriginal groups or [[pariah dog]]s establish themselves near human population, and further develop and maintain themselves without further selection. Neither they carry any specialized [[working dog]] functions. Working, hunting and other functional breeds most likely appeared when there is a demand for certain traits that are prevalent to the extension of  the point one can devote his time and efforts to establish and maintain the group of dogs that perfect in certain traits valuable for that individual. 

Initially the selections would have centered on domestication and useful behavior such as [[bark]]ing at strange creatures, [[livestock]] guarding or [[hunting]] ability. Some dog breeds, such as [[Saluki]] <ref name="isbn186054195X ">{{cite book |author=Allan, Ken; Allan, Diana |title=THE COMPLETE SALUKI (Book of the Breed) |publisher=Ringpress Books |location= |year= |pages= |isbn=186054195X |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>or [[New Guinea Singing Dog]]s , have been bred for specific characteristics for thousands of years. Some [[working dog]] breeds such as [[German Shepherd]]s or [[Labrador Retriever]] <ref>{{cite book |author=Heather Wiles-Fone; H. Wiles-Fone |title=The ultimate Labrador retriever |publisher=Howell Book House |location=New York, N.Y |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0764526391 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>
are established for hundreds years. Later, dogs were also selected for attractive and distinctive forms, resulting in a vast variety of different breeds. Similar dog breeds are classified by dog registries in [[Dog Breeds Groups]].

At a certain point of dog breed development, group of individuals that have dogs of the same breed unite into a [[National]] [[Breed club]], describe their dogs in a specific language by writing a breed [[standard]]<ref name="isbn0876054645 ">{{cite book |author= |title=The Complete dog book: the photograph, history, and official standard of every breed admitted to AKC registration, and the selection, training, breeding, care, andfeeding of pure-bred dogs |publisher=Howell Book House |location=New York, N.Y |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=0876054645 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>. They describe the most desirable breed specimen and also specify working abilities, as well as undesirable traits for [[purebred]] dogs that can belong to this group of dogs. National Breed Clubs promote dog breeds by joining a local popular dog [[breed registry]], as well as internationally, by joining international organizations.  Many traditional dog breeds are recognized by the main breed registries are said to be "purebred". 

== Development of dog breeds ==
There is much speculation but little evidence about when and why canids came to live with humans.  Carles Vil<U+00E0> (et al) of the University of California, California, USA, has studied archaeological evidence (fossil bones) indicating that canids could have been living with humans 100,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web

With the beginnings of agriculture, 12,000 years ago, humans began making use of dogs in various ways, resulting in marked physical differences between dogs and wolves at that point in time. Molecular biologist and founder of the Canine Genome Project Elaine Ostrander comments, "When we became an agricultural society, what we needed dogs for changed enormously, and a further and irrevocable division [between dogs and wolves] occurred at that point."<ref>{{cite web

Almost one hundred years later, another book was published in English (De Canibus Britannicus, 1576) in which the author, Johannes Caius, gathered the types of dogs into four main categories by function or use: hunting dogs, lap dogs, farm dogs, and mongrels. Sub-types of each group were also included, such as terriers and herding dogs.<ref>{{cite web

== Genetics ==
Dog breeds can now be analyzed through genetics. Genetic markers ([[microsatellite]] markers and [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]]) have been analyzed and a representative sample of 85 breeds were placed into four clusters, each cluster having shared ancestors. Cluster 1 is thought to be the oldest, including African and Asian dogs. Cluster 2 is mastiff type dogs; cluster 3 is herding dogs, and cluster 4 modern hunting type dogs (mostly developed in Europe in the 1800s.)<ref>{{cite web

== Dog Breed documentation ==
Dog breeds are documented in lists of antecedents called a stud book.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>

Dog breeds that have been documented may be accepted into one of the major registries ([[kennel club]]s) of dog breeds, such as the FCI, KC, AKC, UKC, and other national registries such as the Japan Kennel Club.  The registry places the breed into the appropriate category, called a [[Dog Breeds Groups|Group]]. Some Groups may be further subdivided by some registries. When the breed is fully accepted, the stud book is closed and only dogs bred from dogs in the stud book will be accepted for registration.<ref>{{cite web

}} </ref> These dogs are referred to as [[Purebred#Purebred_dogs|purebred]].

Dog breed clubs, especially of dogs bred for a particular kind of work, may maintain an open stud book and so may not be included in major registries. The dogs are still considered a breed. An example of this would be the [[Jack Russell Terrier Club of America]]. 

Some dog breeds fit the definition of breed, especially breeds that develop naturally on islands or in isolated areas, but are few in number or have not been sufficiently documented to be registered with one of the major registries. An example of this would be the [[Kintamani (dog)|Kintamani Dog]] and other rare or independent breeds.  

Breeds of dogs can be deliberately created in a relatively short period of time. When they breed true and have been sufficiently documented, they can be accepted by major registries. An example of this is the [[Cesky Terrier]]. <ref>{{cite web

== Groups of dogs mistaken for breeds ==
Groups of dogs that may be mistaken for breeds include working dogs that are categorized by working style rather than appearance, although they may be of various ancestry and may not breed true. The difference between a named group of working dogs and a breed of dogs can be unclear. Examples would be the huntaway and other livestock dogs of New Zealand, the [[Feist (dog)|feist dogs]] of the southern United States, and the Patagonian sheepdogs of Argentina, which are collies mixed with other working dogs. <ref>{{cite web
