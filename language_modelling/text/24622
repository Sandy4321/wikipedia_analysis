The '''Ostrich''' (''Struthio camelus'') is a [[flightless bird]] native to [[Africa]] (and formerly the [[Middle East]]). It is the only living species of its [[family (biology)|family]], '''Struthionidae''', and its [[genus]], '''''Struthio'''''. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at speeds of about 65 km/h (40 mph), the top land speed of any bird.<ref>http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0004737.html</ref>

Ostriches are the [[Largest organism|largest living species]] of [[bird]] and are [[farming|farmed]] in many areas all over the world. The [[scientific name]] for the Ostrich is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "[[camel]] [[sparrow]]" alluding to its long neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ostrich|title=Ostrich|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref> Ostriches share the order [[Struthioniformes]] with [[emu]]s, [[kiwi]]s, and other [[ratite]]s.

==Taxonomy==
The Ostrich was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The ostrich belongs to the [[Struthioniformes]] [[order (biology)|order]] of ([[ratite]]s). Other members include [[rhea (bird)|rheas]], [[emu]]s, [[cassowary|cassowaries]] and the largest bird ever, the now-extinct [[Elephant Bird]] (''Aepyornis''). However, the classification of the ratites as a single order has always been questioned, with the alternative classification restricting the Struthioniformes to the ostrich lineage and elevating the other groups. Presently, molecular evidence is equivocal{{Fact|date=February 2007}} while [[biogeography|paleobiogeographical]] and [[paleontology|paleontological]] considerations are slightly in favor of the multi-order arrangement.
===Subspecies===
Five [[subspecies]] are recognized: 
*''S. c. australis'' in [[Southern Africa]], called the '''Southern Ostrich'''. It is found between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Cunene]] rivers. It was once farmed for its feathers in the [[Little Karoo]] area of [[Cape Province]].<ref name="scott">{{cite book

*''S. c. camelus'' in [[North Africa]], sometimes called the '''North African Ostrich''' or '''Red-necked Ostrich'''. It is the most widespread subspecies, ranging from [[Ethiopia]] and [[Sudan]] in the east throughout the [[Sahel]] to [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]] in the west, and at least in earlier times north to [[Egypt]] and southern [[Morocco]], respectively. It is the largest subspecies, at 2.74&nbsp;m (9&nbsp;ft) 154&nbsp;kilograms (340&nbsp;lb).<ref name="Root"/> The neck is red, the plumage of males is black and white, and the plumage of females is grey.<ref name="Root">{{cite book

*''S. c. massaicus'' in [[East Africa]], sometimes called the '''Masai Ostrich'''. It has some small feathers on its head, and its neck and thighs are bright orange. During the [[mating season]], the male's neck and thighs become brighter. Their range is essentially limited to most of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] and parts of Southern [[Somalia]].<ref name="Root"/>
*''S. c. syriacus'' in the [[Middle East]], sometimes called the '''[[Arabian Ostrich]]''' or '''Middle Eastern Ostrich''', was a subspecies formerly very common in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Syria]], and [[Iraq]]; it became extinct around [[1966]].
*''S. c. molybdophanes'' in [[Somalia]], Ethiopia, and northern Kenya, is called the '''Somali Ostrich'''. The neck and thighs are grey-blue, and during the mating season, the male's neck and thighs become bright blue. The females are more brown than those of other subspecies.<ref name="Root"/> It generally lives in pairs or alone, rather than in flocks. Its range overlaps with ''S. c. massaicus'' in northeastern Kenya.<ref name="Root"/>

[[Image:Struthio camelusZZ.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Struthio camelus'' mounted skull and neck.]]
Analyses indicate that the Somali Ostrich may be better considered a full species. [[mtDNA]] [[haplotype]] comparisons suggest that it diverged from the other Ostriches not quite 4 [[mya (unit)|mya]] due to formation of the [[Great Rift Valley]]. Subsequently, hybridization with the subspecies that evolved southwestwards of its range, ''S. c. massaicus'', has apparently been prevented from occurring on a significant scale by ecological separation, the Somali Ostrich preferring bushland where it browses middle-height vegetation for food while the Masai Ostrich is, like the other subspecies, a [[grazing]] bird of the open [[savanna]] and ''[[miombo]]'' habitat (Freitag & Robinson, 1993).

The population from [[R<U+00ED>o de Oro]] was once separated as ''Struthio camelus spatzi'' because its eggshell pores were shaped like a teardrop and not round, but as there is considerable variation of this character and there were no other differences between these birds and adjacent populations of ''S. c. camelus'', it is no longer considered valid.
<!-- There should be a ref for this: Cornelius Carlos Bezuidenhout: Studies of the population structure and genetic diversity of domesticated and <U+2018>wild<U+2019> ostriches (Struthio camelus); PhD thesis 1999. -->
This population disappeared in the later half of the [[20th century]]. In addition, there have been [[19th century]] reports of the existence of small ostriches in North Africa; these have been referred to as Levaillant's Ostrich (''Struthio bidactylus'') but remain a hypothetical form not supported by material evidence (Fuller, 2000). Given the persistence of savanna wildlife in a few mountaineous regions of the [[Sahara]] (such as the [[Tagant Plateau]] and the [[Ennedi Plateau]]), it is not at all unlikely that ostriches too were able to persist in some numbers until recent times after the drying-up of the Sahara.

===Evolution===
[[Image:Farmed_Ostrich.JPG|thumb|150px|Closeup of farmed ostrich]]
[[Image:Ostrich SA2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wild ostriches at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[South Africa]]]]

The earliest fossil of ostrich-like birds is the Central European ''[[Palaeotis]]'' from the Middle [[Eocene]], a middle-sized flightless bird that was originally believed to be a [[bustard]]. Apart from this enigmatic bird, the [[fossil record]] of the ostriches continues with several species of the modern genus ''Struthio'' which are known from the Early [[Miocene]] onwards. While the relationship of the African species is comparatively straightforward, a large number of Asian species of ostrich have been described from very fragmentary remains, and their interrelationships and how they relate to the African ostriches is very confusing. In [[China]], ostriches are known to have become extinct only around or even after the end of the [[last ice age]]; images of ostriches have been found there on prehistoric pottery and as [[petroglyph]]s. There are also records in maritime history of ostriches being sighted way out at sea in the Indian Ocean and when discovered on the island of Madagascar the sailors of the 18th century referred to them as Sea Ostriches, although this has never been confirmed.

Several of these fossil forms are [[ichnotaxa]] (that is, classified according to the organism's footprints or other trace rather than its body) and their association with those described from distinctive bones is contentious and in need of revision pending more good material (Bibi ''et al.'', 2006).

== Description ==
[[Image:Ostrich Foot.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ostrich foot]]
'''Ostriches''' usually weigh from 93 to 130&nbsp;kg (200 to 285&nbsp;lb), although some male ostriches have been recorded with weights of up to 155&nbsp;kg (340&nbsp;lb). The feathers of adult males are mostly black, with some white on the wings and tail. It is often said that their eyes are larger than their brains. <ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_1593000/1593651.stm</ref> <ref>http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/podcasts/show/2004.10.10/</ref>

Females and young males are greyish-brown and white. The small [[vestigial organ|vestigial]] wings are used by males in mating displays. They can also provide shade for chicks. The [[feather]]s are soft and serve as insulation, and are quite different from the stiff [[airfoil]] feathers of flying birds. There are claws on two of the wings' fingers.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

The strong legs of the Ostrich lack feathers. The bird stands on two toes, with the larger one resembling a [[hoof]]. The outer toe lacks a nail.<ref>

At sexual maturity (two to four years old), male Ostriches can be between 1.8 and 2.7&nbsp;m (6 and 9&nbsp;ft) in height, while female Ostriches range from 1.7 to 2&nbsp;m (5.5 to 6.5&nbsp;ft). During the first year of life, chicks grow about 25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) per month. At one year of age, ostriches weigh around 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lb). An Ostrich can live up to 75&nbsp;years.

==Distribution and habitat==
Ostriches are native to [[savanna]]s and the [[Sahel]] of [[Africa]], both north and south of the equatorial forest zone.<ref name="Donegan">{{cite web

==Behaviour==
[[Image:FlappingOstriches.jpg|thumb|150px|Male and female ostriches "dancing".]]
Ostriches live in [[nomad]]ic groups of 5 to 50 birds that often travel together with other [[grazing]] animals, such as [[zebra]]s or [[antelope]]s.<ref name="Donegan"/> They mainly feed on seeds and other plant matter; occasionally they also eat insects such as [[locust]]s. Lacking teeth, they swallow pebbles that help as [[gastrolith]]s to grind the swallowed foodstuff in the [[gizzard]]. An adult ostrich typically carries about 1 kg of stones in its stomach. Ostriches can go without water for a long time, exclusively living off the moisture in the ingested plants.<ref>{{cite book

  | isbn = 3540592695}}</ref> However, they enjoy water and frequently take baths.<ref name="Donegan"/>

With their acute eyesight and hearing, they can sense [[predator]]s such as [[lion]]s from far away. When being pursued by a predator, Ostriches have been known to reach speeds in excess of 70 km per hour (45 miles per hour), and can maintain a steady speed of 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]).

Ostriches are known to eat almost anything ([[dietary indiscretion]]), particularly in captivity where opportunity is increased.
[[Image:wiki ostrich.jpg|thumb|left|Thermographic image of two ostriches in winter showing high heat retention in the body.]]
Ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In much of its habitat, temperature differences of 40<U+00B0>C between night- and daytime can be encountered. Their temperature control mechanism is more complex than in other birds and mammals, utilizing the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks which can be covered by the wing feathers or bared according to whether the bird wants to retain or lose body heat.

When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds lay their head and neck flat on the ground, making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance. This even works for the males, as they hold their wings and tail low so that the heat haze of the hot, dry air that often occurs in their habitat aids in making them appear as a nondescript dark lump. When threatened, Ostriches run away, but they can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs.<ref name="Donegan"/>

The most unique behaviour occurs when a pair of ostrich bearing young meets another pair. The parents will fight and the winning pairs will be parents of both pairs' offspring. It has been reported that the biggest group of ostriches contains 300&nbsp;offspring. {{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Reproduction===
[[Image:Ostrich nest.jpg|thumbnail|150px|An ostrich's nest]]
Ostriches become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] when 2 to 4 years old; females mature about six months earlier than males. The species is [[Iteroparity|iteroparous]], with the [[mating season]] beginning in March or April and ending sometime before September. The mating process differs in different geographical regions. [[Territory (animal)|Territorial]] males will typically use hisses and other sounds to fight for a [[Harem (zoology)|harem]] of 2 to 5 females (which are called hens). The winner of these fights will breed with all the females in an area but only form a pair bond with one, the dominant female. The female crouches on the ground and is mounted from behind by the male.

[[Image:Ostrich egg.jpg|thumb|left|100px|An ostrich egg.]]
Ostriches are [[egg (biology)|oviparous]]. The females will lay their fertilized [[egg (biology)|eggs]] in a single communal nest, a simple pit scraped in the ground and 30 to 60&nbsp;cm (12-24&nbsp;in) deep. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the bird. The nest may contain 15 to 60 eggs, with an average egg being 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) long, 13&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in) wide, and weigh 1.4&nbsp;kg (3&nbsp;lb). They are shiny and whitish in color. The eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the male by night, making use of the different colors of the two sexes to escape detection. The [[gestation period]] is 35 to 45&nbsp;days. Typically, the male will defend the hatchlings, and teach them how and on what to feed.

Although it is the largest known single cell in nature, an ostrich egg is less than 1.5% of the weight of the mother. Which means that the ostriches lay the smallest eggs for its size.


The [[life span]] of an Ostrich is from 30 to 70 years, with 50 being typical.

==Ostriches and humans== 
===Hunting and farming===
[[Image:Kinson MacMahon.jpg|thumb|150px|Woman wearing a hat decorated with ostrich plumes.]]
In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, there was a demand for ostriches to use in ''[[venatio]]'' games or cooking. They have been hunted and farmed for their feathers, which at various times in history have been very popular for ornamentation in [[fashion]]able clothing (such as [[hat]]s during the [[19th century]]). Their skins were also valued to make goods out of [[Leather#Leather from other animals|leather]]. In the [[18th century]], they were almost hunted to extinction; farming for feathers began in the [[19th century]]. The market for feathers collapsed after [[World War I]], but commercial farming for feathers and later for skins, became widespread during the 1970s.

Ostriches are farmed in over 50 countries around the world, including climates as cold as that of [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], though the majority are in Southern Africa. They will prosper in climates between 30 and &minus;30 <U+00B0>C{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Since they also have the best feed to weight gain ratio of any land animal in the world (3.5:1 whereas that of cattle is 6:1){{Fact|date=June 2007}}, they are attractive economically to raise for meat or other uses. Although they are farmed primarily for leather and secondarily for meat, additional useful by-products are the eggs, [[offal]], and feathers.
[[Image:MaleAndFemaleOstrichNewZealand 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Male and female ostriches on a farm in [[New Zealand]].]]
It is claimed that ostriches produce the strongest commercially available leather.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050208083829/ostrich-association.co.nz/index.cfm/Facts Webarchive article featuring Ostrich information.] Accessed January 13, 2007</ref> Ostrich meat tastes similar to lean [[beef]] and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron.<ref>[http://www.wisegeek.com/is-ostrich-meat-healthy.htm Nutritional value of ostrich meat]</ref>Uncooked, it is a dark red or cherry red color, a bit darker than beef.<ref>[http://www.exoticmeatsales.com/abosme.html About Ostrich Meat]</ref>

The town of [[Oudtshoorn]] in [[South Africa]] has the world's largest population of ostriches. Many farms and specialized breeding centres have been set up around the town such as the [[Safari Show Farm]] and the [[Highgate Ostrich Show Farm]]. The [[CP Nel Museum]] is a museum that specializes in the history of the ostrich.

Ostriches are classified as [[dangerous animals]] in Australia, the US and the UK {{Fact|Feb 2007|date=February 2007}}. There are a number of recorded incidents of people being attacked and killed. Big males can be very territorial and aggressive, and can attack and kick very powerfully with their legs. An Ostrich will easily outrun any human athlete. Their legs are powerful enough to [[disembowel|eviscerate]] large animals.

===Ostrich racing===<!-- This section is linked from [[Racing]] -->
[[Image:OstrichCartJacksonville1.jpg|thumb|Ostrich pulling a cart for [[racing]].]]
Ostriches are large enough for a small human to ride them, typically while holding on to the wings for grip, and in some areas of northern Africa and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] Ostriches are trained as racing mounts. There is little possibility of the practice becoming more widespread, due to the irascible temperament and the difficulties encountered in saddling the birds. Ostrich races in the United States have been criticized by [[animal rights]] organizations; however, they continue to take place in the streets of [[Miami Beach]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

===Cultural depictions===
In popular [[mythology]], the Ostrich is famous for hiding its head in the sand at the first sign of danger. The [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writer [[Pliny the Elder]] is noted for his descriptions of the ostrich in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', where he describes the Ostrich and the fact that it hides its head in a bush. He adds that it can eat and digest anything. This is embellished in the ''[[Physiologus]]'' which reports Ostriches can swallow iron and hot coals. The last belief persisted and evolved in [[heraldry]], where the Ostrich is represented with a horseshoe in its mouth, symbolic of its iron-eating ability.<ref name = "Cooper92">{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=JC |title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals |pages=170-71 |year=1992 |publisher= Aquarian Press |location=London |isbn=1-85538-118-4}}</ref>

It was a positive symbol in [[Ancient Egypt]]; the deity [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] is portrayed in art as wearing an ostrich feather, while [[Ma'at]], goddess of law and justice, bore one on her head.<ref name = "Cooper92"/>

The Ostrich's behavior is also mentioned in the [[Bible]] in God's discourse to Job ([[Book of Job|Job]] 39.13-18). It is described as being joyfully proud of its small wings, but unwise and unmindful of the safety of its nest and harsh in the treatment of its offspring, even though it can put a horse to shame with its speed. Elsewhere, ostriches are mentioned as proverbial examples of bad parenting (''see [[Arabian Ostrich]] for details'').

In the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] religion, it is traditional to place seven large Ostrich eggs on the roof of a church to symbolize the Heavenly and Earthly Angels. The Ostrich represents light and water for the [[Dogon]] people, its undulating movement symbolic of water movement.<ref name = "Cooper92"/>

There have been no recorded observations of Ostriches putting their heads in the sand. A common counterargument is that a species that displayed this behavior would not survive very long. Ostriches do deliberately swallow sand and pebbles to help grind up their food; seeing this from a distance may have caused some early observers to believe that their heads were buried in sand. Also, ostriches that are threatened but unable to run away may fall to the ground and stretch out their necks in an attempt to become less visible. The coloring of an ostrich's neck is similar to sand and could give the illusion that the neck and head have been completely buried.<ref>[http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-ostrich.html Sandiego zoo article on ostriches].</ref>

===Ostrich Feather Dusters===
In addition to its function in clothing, costumes, and decorations, one of the most useful contributions of the Ostrich feather to industry is its use in feather dusters. The original South African Ostrich Feather Dusters were invented in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa by missionary, broom factory manager, Harry S. Beckner in 1903.
[[Image:OstrichFeatherDuster.jpg|thumb|150px|High Quality Ostrich Feather Duster]]
The first [[Ostrich Feather Dusters]] were wound on broom handles using the foot powered kick winder and the same wire used to attach broom straw. Ostrich feathers were sorted for quality, color and length before being wound in three layers to the handle. The first layer was wound with the feathers curving inward to hide the head of the handle. The second two layers were wound curving outward to give it a full figure and its trademark flower shape.

The First Ostrich Feather Duster Company in the United States was formed in 1913 by Harry S. Beckner and his brother George Beckner in Athol Massachusetts and has survived till this day as the Beckner Feather Duster Company under the care of George Beckner's great granddaughter, Margret Fish Rempher. Today the largest manufacturer of [[Ostrich Feather Dusters]] is Texas Feathers (TxF)which is located in Arlington Texas.

Young apprentices still use the manual kick winder to learn the trade of building the hand crafted Ostrich Feather Duster. However, to expedite the manufacturing process, factories now allow veteran craftsman to use electric powered winders to build the duster. Building an Ostrich feather duster can be dangerous. The wire is under tension that is strong enough to sever a finger if it were to get caught between the handle and the wire.

The Ostrich feather is durable, soft and flexible, which accounts for the success of the Ostrich feather duster over the last 100 years. Because the feather does not zipper together it is prone to developing a static charge which actually attracts and holds dust which can then be shaken out or washed off. Because of its similar makeup to human hair, care of the ostrich feather requires only an occasional shampoo and towel or air dry.

The farming of Ostriches for their feathers does not harm the bird. During molting season the birds are gathered in a pen, burlap sacks are placed over their heads so they will remain calm and trained "pickers" pluck the loose molting feathers from the birds. The birds are then released unharmed back onto the farm.
