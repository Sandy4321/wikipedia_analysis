"'''Bart on the Road'''" is the twentieth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on March 31, 1996. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] makes his own [[Identity document forgery|fake driver's license]]. He rents a car with it and takes [[Milhouse]], [[Martin Prince|Martin]], and [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] on a [[road trip]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]]. In Knoxville, however, the car gets destroyed, and they are stranded without any money or transportation. To get Bart home, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] orders equipment for the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|power plant]] and ships it via [[courier]] from Knoxville, with the boys stowed away inside the crate.

The episode was written by [[Richard Appel]], and directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]]. The idea of a road trip was "so exciting" that the writers immediately knew they wanted to write it. It features cultural references to the 1991 film ''[[Naked Lunch (film)|Naked Lunch]]'', American singer [[Andy Williams]], and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine. Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics, and ''[[Central Michigan Life]]'' named it the eighth best episode of the show. It acquired a [[Nielsen rating]] of 7.2, and was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.

==Plot==
[[Image:Simpsons-Sunsphere.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Sunsphere]] as depicted in the show]][[Principal Skinner]] closes school the day before spring break and sends the children on a "[[Take Our Daughters And Sons To Work Day|go to work with your parents day]]" in order to take a trip to [[Hong Kong]]. Bart very reluctantly goes to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] with his aunts [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]], and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] goes to the nuclear power plant with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], where she makes his work day fun. At the DMV, Bart makes himself a fake driver's license, which he, Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse use to hire a [[car rental|rental car]]. The boys tell their parents they are going to attend the "National Grammar Rodeo" in Canada, but secretly take the rented car for a road trip to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] after finding a brochure for the [[1982 World's Fair|city's World's Fair]].

In Knoxville, however, they find out that the fair was held fourteen years earlier, and that its featured attraction, the [[Sunsphere]], is now being used as a warehouse for a wigshop. The boys' car soon gets destroyed by the Sunsphere being toppled by a rock Nelson threw, and they are stranded without any money or transportation. They sign up as couriers and then go to Hong Kong. Bart places a collect call to Lisa, who has spent the entire spring break with Homer at work, to ask her for advice. Lisa obtains Homer's promise that he will not get upset and she reveals Bart's predicament. To get Bart home, Homer orders equipment for the power plant and ships it via courier from Knoxville, with Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin stowed away inside the crate and Bart as the courier.

The ending credits begin with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] getting calls from Principal Skinner, saying he's seen Bart at the Hong Kong airport as a courier, the [[Tennessee]] State Police about Bart and the others, and finally Bart's boss saying he needs to accompany human [[kidney]]s to [[Amsterdam]] as a courier.

==Production==
The episode was written by [[Richard Appel]],<ref name="book"/> who wanted to do an episode that had two things; a "go to work with your parents day" and Bart getting a driver's license. The "go to work with your parents day" idea appealed to Appel because it was something he "lost the right" to do when he went from [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] to [[private school]] as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he "didn't have to do anything" at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.<ref name="Appel">{{cite video | people=Appel, Richard|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The writing staff had never done a spring break episode before so they thought, "What would Lisa and Bart do on spring break?" and came up with the road trip plot. [[Bill Oakley]], the [[show runner]] of ''The Simpsons'' at the time, said that road trips were something that the writers liked to write stories about. The idea of four children going on a road trip was "so exciting" that they immediately knew they wanted to write it. There was a debate over where the children would go, and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], was first suggested, but the writers eventually decided to have them go to a "funny unlikely place".<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Oakley's show runner partner, [[Josh Weinstein]], said that the writers were always looking for combinations of characters that had not been done many times on the show. Homer and Lisa had not been done "too often" and they wanted the two characters to bond and get closer to each other.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The episode was directed by [[Swinton O. Scott III]].<ref name="book"/> It was difficult to animate because the animators had to draw completely new designs for the locations outside of Springfield, such as Knoxville. The car scenes were also difficult to animate. At the time, ''The Simpsons'' was using [[traditional animation]] without computers, but they had to get one for a scene where the camera spins around the car from above.<ref name="Silverman"/> The car was difficult to animate because it had to "look real" and not "boxy like a truck". The car was based on a 1993 [[Oldsmobile]] car with rounded edges.<ref name="Weinstein"/> ''The Simpsons'' animator [[David Silverman]] said that the episode was "probably the most difficult one" Scott had to direct on the show.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart on the Road"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

==Reception==

Since airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics.  The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average."<ref name="BBC">{{citeweb|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page7.shtml|title=King-Size Homer|accessdate=2007-03-06|author= Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian|publisher=BBC|year=2000}}</ref> Dave Foster of DVD Times said that "Bart on the Road" is an episode which is built upon a "frankly ludicrous" idea which if the writers were to "stumble upon" now, "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they do give the setup a great deal of consideration both on and off the screen." He thought the story was "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." Foster thinks "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60554|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season |publisher=DVD Times|date=2006-02-25|author=Foster, Dave }}</ref> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he "loves" the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me."<ref name=dvdmovieguide>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-12-01|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonseven.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season (1995)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide|date=2006-01-05|author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays."
