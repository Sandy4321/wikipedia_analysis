[[Image:canal.at.bathampton.arp.jpg|thumb|right|The canal at [[Bathampton]], near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]]]

The '''Kennet and Avon Canal''' is a [[canal]] in southern [[England]]. The name may be used to refer to the route of the original '''Kennet and Avon Canal Company''', which linked the [[River Kennet]] at [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] to the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], or to the entire navigation between the [[River Thames]] at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and the [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]] at [[Bristol]]. In the latter case, the earlier improved river navigations of the River Kennet (between Reading and Newbury) and River Avon (between Bath and Bristol) are included.<ref name=kamplan1>{{cite web | title=The Kennet and Avon Museum, Devises | work=Kennet and Avon Canal Trust | url=http://www.katrust.org/museum_heritage_planning_001.htm|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> 

The River Kennet was made navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath followed suit in 1727. The canal between Newbury and Bath was opened in 1810 and is 57&nbsp;miles (92&nbsp;km) long. Taken together, the two earlier river navigations and the later canal total 87&nbsp;miles (140&nbsp;km) in length.<ref name=kamplan1>{{cite web | title=The Kennet and Avon Museum, Devises | work=Kennet and Avon Canal Trust | url=http://www.katrust.org/museum_heritage_planning_001.htm|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref>

In the later 19th and early 20th centuries the canal fell into disuse following competition from the [[Great Western Railway]] who owned the canal. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, and today is a popular [[heritage tourism]] destination, for boating, [[canoeing]], [[fishing]], [[walking]] and [[cycling]]. The canal is also important for [[wildlife conservation]].

The section from Bristol to Bath is the course of the River Avon which flows through a wide valley, but has been made navigable by a series of [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and [[weirs]]. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as [[Bradford on Avon]]. The ornate Bath locks lead to a stretch through [[Limpley Stoke]] valley with few locks. The spectacular flights of locks at Devizes and Crofton raise the canal to its highest level, the long 'summit pound' which includes the [[Bruce Tunnel]]. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of [[Wiltshire]] and [[Berkshire]] to Newbury where it joins the River Kennet and becomes a navigable river to Reading where it flows into the River Thames.

== History ==
[[Image:John Rennie (Engineer).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[John Rennie (father)|John Rennie]], 1810, by Sir [[Henry Raeburn]].]]
The idea of an east-west waterway link across southern [[England]] was first mooted in [[Elizabethan]] times based on the fact that the Avon and Thames are only 3 miles (4.8 km) apart at one point. The sea route between [[Bristol]] and [[London]] was hazardous during the 18th and early 19th centuries, because [[Atlantic]] storms and the rugged coast line took their toll on the small coastal [[sailing ships]] of the day, and also because a succession of conflicts with [[France]] and her allies, frequently made British cargo ships navigating the [[English channel]], the prey of both [[privateers]] and [[warships]] of the [[French navy]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Trust | url=http://www.katrust.org/museum_heritage_planning_001.htm | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

Although plans had been discussed for a canal, no action was taken until the early 18th century when the Avon navigation from Bristol to Bath and the Kennet navigation through [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] were built to meet local needs, independently of each other, but both under the supervision of surveyor-engineer [[John Hoare]]. In [[1788]] the so-called "Western Canal" was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as [[Hungerford]], [[Marlborough]], [[Calne]], [[Chippenham, Wiltshire|Chippenham]] and [[Melksham]] along its proposed route, although even at that time there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. In 1793 a further survey was conducted by [[John Rennie (engineer)|John Rennie]] and the route changed to a more southerly course encompassing [[Great Bedwyn]], [[Devizes]], [[Trowbridge]] and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. This was accepted, by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by [[Charles Dundas, 1st Baron Amesbury|Charles Dundas]], and on 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received [[Royal assent]] and construction began. The canal opened in 1810 after 16 years of construction, including the building of a number of [[aqueduct]]s (including [[Dundas Aqueduct|Dundas]] and [[Avoncliff Aqueduct|Avoncliff]]), [[canal lock|locks]] and [[pumping station]]s. The pumping stations, at [[Claverton Pumping Station|Claverton]] and [[Crofton Pumping Station|Crofton]], were needed to overcome water supply problems. The final, and perhaps most impressive engineering feat being the completion of the [[Caen Hill locks]] at Devizes.<ref name="allsop">{{cite book |last=Allsop |first=Niall |title=The Kennet & Avon Canal |year=1987 |publisher=Millstream Book |location=Bath |id=ISBN 0-948975-15-6 }}</ref> 

The opening of the [[Great Western Railway]] in [[1841]] relieved the canal of much of its traffic, and in [[1852]] the railway company took over its running, levying high tolls until the canal was hardly used. The [[Somerset Coal Canal]] and [[Wilts and Berks Canal]] which supplied some of the trade from the [[Somerset coalfield]] to the Kennet and Avon closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. 

During [[World War II]] a large number of [[concrete]] [[bunker]]s known as [[pillboxes]] were built as part of the [[GHQ Line]] to [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II|defend against an expected German invasion]], and many of these are still visible today.<ref name="pearson"> {{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Michael |authorlink= |title=Kennet & Avon Middle Thames:Pearson's Canal Companion |year=2003 |publisher=Central Waterways Supplies|location=Rugby |id=ISBN 0-907864-97-X}} </ref>

By the [[1950s]] large portions of the canal were closed because of poor lock maintenance. In [[1956]] the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust successfully petitioned against its legal closure.  In [[1963]] the newly formed [[British Waterways]] took over the canal and began restoration work.<ref name="pearson" />  

The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in the 1960s to restore the then-closed Kennet & Avon Canal from Reading to Bristol as a "through" navigation and as a public amenity. Since then, in partnership with British Waterways and the [[riparian]] local authorities, the Trust has continued to work to safeguard the navigation. In [[1990]] Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] reopened the canal.  In 1996 the ongoing problem of water shortage was resolved when new [[backpump]]s were installed at the flight of 29 Caen Hill locks in Devizes at a cost of [[Pound Sterling|UK<U+00A3>]]1 million.  The pumps raise water 235&nbsp;feet (72&nbsp;m) at a rate of 300,000 imperial [[gallon]]s per hour (380&nbsp;L/s). The Kennet & Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single [[National Lottery]] grant ever to be awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund - [[Pound Sterling|UK<U+00A3>]]25 million towards a [[Pound Sterling|UK<U+00A3>]]29 million project, to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations. The completion of restoration was celebrated in May 2003 with a visit from [[HRH Prince Charles]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Museum | url=http://www.ipresent.co.uk/KA3.HTM | accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Trust | url=http://www.katrust.org/ | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

== Canal today ==
[[Image:Devizeswharf.JPG|thumb|[[Devizes]] wharf showing the [[Kennet & Avon Canal Museum|canal museum]]]]
The canal today is a [[heritage tourism]] destination. Boating, with both [[narrowboats]] and [[cruisers]], is popular, particularly in the summer months, with privately owned craft and hire boats from the range of [[marina]]s being much in evidence, and there are numerous [[canoe]] clubs along the its length. The [[Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon]] is held annually starting from Devizes Wharf, the site of the [[Kennet & Avon Canal Museum]], at first light on [[Good Friday]] each year and the competitors have to negotiate 75 locks in the 125-mile route between Devizes and the finish at [[Westminster]]. The winning time is usually around 17<U+00BD> hours.

Cycling is permitted along the length of the canal [[towpath]] except for a short 600-metre (656 yard) section near [[Woolhampton]]. Some sections of the canal towpath have been improved to provide a wider path which is more suitable for cyclists and disabled users. Under a partnership arrangement involving British Waterways, [[Sustrans]] and the riparian Local Authorities, two main sections of the canal have been improved, and, with a few short diversions, run from Reading to [[Marsh Benham]] and from Devizes to Bath as part of the [[National Cycle Network]] (NCN) Route 4. Fishing for [[bream]], [[tench]], [[Roach (fish)|roach]], [[rudd]], [[perch]], [[gudgeon]], [[Esox|pike]] and [[carp]] is permitted throughout the year from the towpath of the canal, but almost the whole length of the canal is leased to Angling Associations or Fishing Clubs. There are a variety of riverside [[pubs]], shops and tea rooms. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust also operates shops and tearooms at; [[Aldermaston Lock]], [[Newbury Lock|Newbury Wharf]], [[Crofton Pumping Station]], [[Devizes]] and [[Bradford on Avon]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Canal Trust, Information for recreation | url=http://www.katrust.org/information.htm | accessdate=2006-09-20}}</ref>

The canal is also important for wildlife conservation, with a variety of birds including [[Herons]] and [[Kingfishers]], small [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] animals and [[Phragmites|reeds]] and other plant life along the edges of the canal. Over 100 different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over the length of the canal. Of these 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds with 14 species confirmed as breeding including [[Sand Martin]]s (''Riparia riparia'') which nest in the drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. The rare [[Reed Bunting]] (''Emberiza schoeniclus'') is found at various places along the canal. [[Wilton Water]] by [[Crofton locks]] and the Kennet Valley [[gravel pit]]s provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. The [[Red Kite]] (''Milvus milvus'') has also been seen in [[Great Bedwyn]]. Several [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) which exhibit great [[bio-diversity]] are situated along the canal. Key sites which are home to several rare species include the [[Aldermaston Gravel Pits]], [[Woolhampton Reed Bed|Woolhampton]] and [[Thatcham Reed Beds]] and [[Freeman's Marsh]], [[Hungerford]]. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves throughout the length of the canal. Several species of [[Odonata]] ([[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]]) have also been identified. Measures to preserve and create [[Water Vole]] (''Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis'') habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal and new techniques of bank protection have been developed which are <U+2018>vole friendly<U+2019>.<ref>{{cite web | title=Kennet & Avon Trade Association | url=http://www.katrade.org.uk/canal.htm | accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

== Bristol to Bath ==
{{K+A-B-B}}
[[Image:Swinefordweir.JPG|thumb|left|Weir at [[Swineford lock|Swineford]]]]
The [[Floating Harbour]] in Bristol, is a 70 [[acre]] (0.28 km<U+00B2>) harbour was created by installing [[Canal lock|lock gates]] on a [[tide|tidal]] stretch of the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] in the centre of the city, giving it the name Floating Harbour as it is not affected by the tides.  The harbour branches from the navigable River Avon at [[Netham Lock]] in east Bristol.  The first mile of the harbour is the artificial Feeder Canal, the River following its original route.  Beside [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] the harbour rejoins the original route of the Avon and meanders through, [[Bristol city centre]], [[Canon's Marsh]] and [[Hotwells]], where it rejoins the river and flows into the [[Avon Gorge]].  Between Temple Meads and Hotwells, at a distance never more than one kilometre south of the harbour, the Avon flows through the artificial New Cut, reducing currents and silting in the harbour and preventing flooding. East of Netham Lock is the Avon Navigation, which continues upstream for 12&nbsp;miles (19.31&nbsp;km) as far as Bath. The river Avon had been navigable from Bristol to Bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure.<ref name=kamplan1>{{cite web | title=The Kennet and Avon Museum, Devises | work=Kennet and Avon Canal Trust | url=http://www.katrust.org/museum_heritage_planning_001.htm|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> The first cargo of 'Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal' arrived in Bath in December 1727.<ref name="allsop" /> The stretch is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs at [[Hanham Lock|Hanham]], [[Keynsham Lock|Keynsham]], [[Swineford Lock|Swineford]], [[Saltford Lock|Saltford]], [[Kelston Lock|Kelston]] and [[Weston Lock|Weston]], which together overcome a rise of 30&nbsp;feet (9.15&nbsp;m).<ref name="pearson" /> 
[[Image:Pulteney Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pulteney Bridge|Pulteney weir]]]]
The Avon is continuously navigable from its mouth at Avonmouth as far as [[Pulteney Bridge|Pulteney weir]] in the centre of the city of Bath. The Kennet and Avon Canal connects with the Avon just below this weir and [[Bath Locks]]. Together with the Kennet Navigation and the [[River Thames]] it provides a through route for [[canal]] [[boat]]s from Bristol to [[London]]. This navigable stretch can be split into three sections.

Several areas along this stretch have been designated as [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]], including; [[Bickley Wood]], [[Cleeve Wood, Hanham]], [[Stidham Farm]] near [[Keynsham]], and [[Newton Saint Loe SSSI|Newton Saint Loe]] (for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous [[Pleistocene]] gravels along the River Avon).

In the Avon Valley to the east of Bath, the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal.  The canal passes the remains of a loading bay, used in the past for Bath Stone from the quarries on [[Bathampton|Bathampton Down]] which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow double-decker buses to use the [[A36 road|A36]]).  Next, the canal passes Claverton Pumping Station, which was used to pump water from the River Avon into the canal, and then crosses over the river and railway at the [[Dundas Aqueduct]] and back over them again at the Avoncliff Aqueduct.  At the western end of the Dundas Aqueduct the canal is joined by the remains of the [[Somerset Coal Canal]], of which a short stretch has been restored to form the Brassknocker Basin <ref>{{cite web | title=Origin of Brassknocker Basin name| url=http://www.monktoncombe.com/poap/names/page20.htm | accessdate=2007-11-21}}</ref>.

It was in Bradford on Avon that the first sod was cut for the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1794 and soon afterwards there were wharves above and below [[Bradford Lock]].<ref name="allsop" /> Next to the canal, a little way west of the lock, is a huge 14th century tithe barn.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Wide Way West | url=http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/jim.shead/The-Wide-Way-West.html|accessdate=2006-09-09}}</ref> Further east are [[swing bridge]]s, the [[Semington Locks]] in the little village of [[Semington]], where the [[Wilts and Berks Canal]] joined, and [[Seend Locks|Seend]].

{{K+A-D-N}}
[[image:Caen.hill.locks.in.devizes.arp.jpg|thumb|left|These 16 locks at [[Caen Hill locks|Caen Hill]] form part of the [[Devizes]] flight of 29 locks]]

[[Caen Hill locks]], at [[Devizes]], provide a spectacular vision of the engineering needed to build and maintain the canal. The main flight of 16 locks forms part of a longer series of 29 locks.  The total rise is 237&nbsp;feet in just 2&nbsp;miles (72&nbsp;m in 3.2&nbsp;km) or a 1 in 30 gradient, making Caen Hill the steepest flight of locks in the world. The locks come in three groups: seven at Foxhangers, sixteen at Caen Hill and six at the town end of the flight. Whilst the locks were under construction in the early 1800s a tramroad provided a link between Foxhangers, at the bottom of the flight, and Devizes at the top, the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal. Because a large volume of water is needed for the locks to operate a back pump was installed at Foxhangers in 1996, capable of returning 32 million litres (7 million UK gallons) of water per day to the top of the flight which is equivalent to one lockful every eleven minutes.<ref name="pearson" /> They were the last part of the 87&nbsp;mile route of the canal to be completed. Because of the steepness of the terrain there was not the space to use the normal arrangement of water pounds between the locks. As a result, the 16 locks utilise unusually large side ponds to store the water needed to operate.<ref>{{cite web | title=Caen Hill Locks | work=Waterscape.com | url=http://www.waterscape.com/servicesdirectory/Caen_Hill_Locks | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> In the early 19th century, 1829&ndash;43, the flight was lit by gas lights.<ref>{{cite web | title=Caen Hill Locks | work=Kennet and Avon Scrapbook | url=http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/kacanal/html/kac0043.htm | accessdate=2006-09-18}}</ref> The locks take 5&ndash;6&nbsp;hours to travel in a boat and lock 41 is the narrowest on the canal.<ref name="allsop" />
 
[[Image:Bruce tunnel stowell.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bruce Tunnel]] (eastern portal) at the canal summit]]Beyond Devizes the canal passes through [[Wiltshire]] countryside and a series of locks and [[swing bridge]]s before another flight at [[Crofton locks|Crofton]]. Between [[Wootton top lock]] and Crofton is the [[Canal pound|summit pound]] of the canal at 450&nbsp;feet (137&nbsp;m) above [[sea level]], which stretches for about 2&nbsp;miles (3.21&nbsp;km)and includes the [[Bruce Tunnel]] which is 502&nbsp;yards (459&nbsp;m) long. The nine locks at Crofton achieve a total rise/fall of 61&nbsp;feet (18.59&nbsp;m).<ref name="pearson" /> Water is pumped to the summit at the western end of the locks, from [[Wilton Water]], by the restored [[Crofton Pumping Station]]. The original [[steam]] powered pumping station is preserved and still operates on selected weekends; it contains one of the oldest operational [[Watt steam engine|Watt style beam engines]] in the world, dating from [[1812]], although for day to day operation, the pumping station now uses electric pumps, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.

Near Crofton is [[Savernake Forest]] and the remains of a railway bridge which carried the [[Midland and South Western Junction Railway]] over the canal.

This section of the canal passes through agricultural land with occasional woodlands. Several sites on or very close to the canal have been dsignated by [[English Nature]] as [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] including; [[Jones's Mill]], [[Freeman's Marsh]], [[Kennet and Lambourn Floodplain]], [[Kennet Valley Alderwoods]], [[Irish Hill Copse]] and the [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Wiltshire|River Kennet SSSI]].

The River Kennet is navigable from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] downstream to the junction with the [[River Thames]] at Kennet Mouth, in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. 

The stretch from Newbury to High Bridge in Reading is an improved river navigation known as the Kennet Navigation, which was opened in 1723. Throughout this navigation, stretches of natural riverbed alternate with 11&nbsp;miles (17.70&nbsp;km) of artificially created lock cuts and a series of locks that together overcome a fall of 130&nbsp;feet (39.63&nbsp;m).

Below [[Colthrop Lock]] in [[Thatcham]], the river leaves behind the built up area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. The village of [[Woolhampton]] and the canal settlement of [[Aldermaston Wharf]] are the only significant settlements encountered until the river starts entering the built-up area of Reading at [[Sheffield Lock]] in [[Theale]]. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide [[flood plain]] surrounding the river, and the surrounding town is far from obvious. In this stretch [[Garston Lock]], the last remaining [[turf sided lock]] on the navigation, is passed.

Shortly after passing [[Fobney Lock]] and the associated [[water treatment]] works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At [[County Lock]], the river enters the centre of Reading, where the river formerly flowed through the centre of a large [[brewery]]. The narrow and twisting stretch of the river here became known as ''Brewery Gut'' and, because of the poor visibility and difficulty of boats passing in this stretch, boat traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime [[traffic light]]s. Today the Brewery Gut forms a major feature of  [[The Oracle, Reading|The Oracle shopping centre]]. 

Immediately after The Oracle, the river flows under the historic arched High Bridge, which forms a historical and administrative divide on the river. The last mile of the River Kennet in Reading below the bridge has been navigable since at least the thirteenth century. It was the absence of a floodplain on this stretch of the Kennet that enabled the development of wharves and led to Reading's importance as a river port in the [[middle ages]]. Originally this short stretch of river, which includes [[Blake's Lock]], was under the control of [[Reading Abbey]], but today it is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] as if it were part of the River Thames.

Sites of Special Scientific Interest on the stretch between Newbury and Reading include; [[reed bed]]s at [[Thatcham Reed Beds|Thatcham]] and [[Woolhampton Reed Bed|Woolhampton]] and [[Aldermaston Gravel Pits]].
