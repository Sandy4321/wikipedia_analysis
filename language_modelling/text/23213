{{See also|Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions}}
An '''emission intensity''' is the average emission rate of a given [[pollutant]] from a given source relative to the intensity of a specific activity; for example [[gram]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] released per [[megajoule]] of energy produced, or the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions produced to [[GDP]]. Emission intensities are used to derive estimates of [[air pollutant]] or [[greenhouse gas]] emissions based on the amount of fuel [[combustion|combusted]], the number of animals in [[animal husbandry]], on industrial production levels, distances traveled or similar activity data. Emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. The related terms '''emission factor''' and '''carbon intensity''' are often used interchangeably, but "factors" exclude aggregate activities such as GDP, and "carbon" excludes other pollutants.

== Estimating emissions ==

Emission factors assume a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity:

''Emission<sub>pollutant</sub> = Activity * Emission Factor<sub>pollutant</sub>''

Intensities are also used in projecting possible future scenarios such as those used in the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] assessments, along with projected future changes in population, economic activity and energy technologies. The interrelations of these variables is treated under the so-called [[Kaya identity]].

The level of uncertainty of the resulting estimates depends significantly on the source category and the pollutant. Some examples: 
*[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the combustion of fuel can be estimated with a high degree of certainty regardless of how the fuel is used as these emissions depend almost exclusively on the [[carbon]] content of the fuel, which is generally known with a high degree of precision. The same is true for [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>), since also sulphur contents of fuels are generally well known. Both carbon and sulphur are almost completey oxidized during combustion and all carbon and sulphur atoms in the fuel will be present in the [[flue gas]]es as CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> respectively.
*In contrast, the levels of other air pollutants and non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of a small fraction of the fuel ([[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], [[NMVOC|non-methane volatile organic compounds]]) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the smoke stack or tailpipe. Examples of these are [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], NO<sub>x</sub>, a mixture of [[nitric oxide]], NO, and [[nitrogen dioxide]], NO<sub>2</sub>).
*[[Nitrous oxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O) emissions from agricultural soils are highly uncertain because they depend very much on both the exact conditions of the soil, the application of [[fertilizers]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions.

== World CO<sub>2</sub> intensity in 2009 ==
In 2009 CO<sub>2</sub> intensity in the OECD countries reduced by 2.9%  and amounted to 0.33 kCO<sub>2</sub>/$05p in the OECD countries.<ref>[http://yearbook.enerdata.net/CO2-intensity-data.html Enerdata Statistical Yearbook 2012.]</ref>
The USA posted a higher ratio of 0.41 kCO<sub>2</sub>/$05p while Europe showed the largest drop in CO<sub>2</sub> intensity compared to the previous year (<U+2212>3.7%). CO<sub>2</sub> intensity continued to be roughly higher in non-OECD countries. Despite a slight improvement, China continued to post a high CO<sub>2</sub> intensity (0.81 kCO<sub>2</sub>/$05p). CO<sub>2</sub> intensity in Asia rose by 2% during 2009 since energy consumption continued to develop at a strong pace. Important ratios were also observed in countries in CIS and the Middle East.

== Carbon Intensity in 2012 ==
[[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]] (CEB) has calculated carbon intensity for [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] projects carbon intensity in 2012 to be 0,343 tn/MWh.<ref>[http://www.kbb.sk/files/calculation-of-cabon-intensity-2012.pdf Calculation of carbon intensity in 2012]</ref>

== Carbon intensity in Europe ==

Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007.<ref>[http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/ Energy Efficiency Trends and Policies in the EU 27 Results of the ODYSSEE-MURE project ]</ref> Over the period 1990<U+2013>2007, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%/year although the economic activity (GDP) increased by 2.3%/year. After dropping until 1994 (<U+2212>1.6%/year), the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have increased steadily (0.4%/year on average) until 2003 and decreased slowly again since (on average by 0.6%/year). Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007, that is to say a decrease by 10%.
Almost 40% of the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> intensity is due to increased use of energy carriers with lower emission factors
Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per unit of GDP, the <U+201C>CO<sub>2</sub> intensity<U+201D>, decreased more rapidly than energy intensity: by 2.3%/year and 1.4%/year, respectively, on average between 1990 and 2007.<ref>This section deals with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from energy combustion published in official inventories from the European Environment Agency. The indicators are not expressed under normal climate conditions (i. e. with climate corrections) to comply with the official definition of CO<sub>2</sub> inventories. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of final consumers include the emissions of auto producers.</ref>

== Emission factors for greenhouse gas inventory reporting ==

One of the most important uses of emission factors is for the reporting of national [[Greenhouse gas inventory|greenhouse gas inventories]] under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The so-called [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I Parties]] to the UNFCCC have to annually report their national total emissions of greenhouse gases in a formalized reporting format, defining the source categories and fuels that must be included. 

The UNFCCC has accepted the '''Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories''',<ref>{{cite web 
|url= http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.html 
|title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
|publisher=IPCC 
|author=Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
|year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> developed and published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) as the emission estimation methods that must be used by the parties to the convention to ensure transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability and accuracy of the national greenhouse gas inventories.<ref>[http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/sbsta/08.pdf]</ref> These IPCC Guidelines are the primary source for default emission factors. Recently IPCC has published the '''2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'''. These and many more greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on IPCC's Emission Factor Database.<ref>{{cite web 
|url= http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php 
|title=Emission Factor Database <U+2013> Main Page 
|publisher=IPCC 
|year=2012
|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> Commercially-applicable organisational greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on the search engine, EmissionFactors.com.<ref>{{cite web 
|url= http://emissionfactors.com/ 
|title=Emission Factors |work=emissionfactors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

Particularly for non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, there is often a high degree of uncertainty associated with these emission factors when applied to individual countries. In general, the use of country-specific emission factors would provide more accurate estimates of emissions than the use of the default emission factors. According to the IPCC, if an activity is a major source of emissions for a country ('key source'), it is 'good practice' to develop a country-specific emission factor for that activity.

== Emission factors for air pollutant inventory reporting ==
National Air Pollution Emission Inventories are required annually under the provisions of the [[UNECE]] [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (LRTAP). Emission estimation methods and the associated emission factors for air pollutants have been developed by the [http://www.emep.int/ EMEP] Task Force on Emission Inventories and Projections ([http://tfeip-secretariat.org/unece.htm TFEIP]) and are published in the [http://reports.eea.europa.eu/EMEPCORINAIR5/en/page002.html EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook].
