'''''The Castle Doctrine''''' is a 2014 [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Jason Rohrer]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] via [[Valve (company)|Valve]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform. The game was released on January 29, 2014 for all platforms. Set in the early [[1990s]], it pits players against one another as they invade others' houses and attempt to steal money from their vaults, while also setting up traps and other obstacles to keep their own vaults safe.

In creating the game, Rohrer was influenced by his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding [[gun rights]] and home invasions. During development and [[software release life cycle|beta testing]], the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game's intended message.

==Gameplay==
[[File:The Castle Doctrine house screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|The player character reorganizes his house to protect his vault. His wife and children are visible in the top-center of the screen.]]
''The Castle Doctrine'' incorporates elements of [[puzzle video game|puzzle]], [[strategy video game|strategy]], [[stealth game|stealth]],<ref name="pcgamer"/> and [[roguelike]] games,<ref name="gi"/> viewed from a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] perspective.<ref name="pcgamer"/> It focuses on maintaining and protecting a vault of money stored in one's house from intruders. These intruders are actually other players of the game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money<U+2014>presented in a list rather than found through exploration<U+2014>in the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, how many others have tried to rob it, and how many have died in the process.<ref name="polygon"/> All deaths in the game are [[permanent death|permanent]];<ref name="pcgamer"/> upon dying, the player must create a new character.<ref name="rock"/>

The player can protect their vault in a number of ways, such as building walls, keeping [[guard dog]]s,<ref name="polygon"/> setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits,<ref name="pcgamer"/> and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members<U+2014>by default, a wife and two children<U+2014>being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; it can be used to purchase more objects to defend one's own vault.<ref name="polygon"/><ref name="pcgamer"/> Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.<ref name="pcgamer"/>

When invading another's house, the player can attempt to deter these defenses in such ways as smashing windows, dismantling walls, short-circuiting machines, and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat,<ref name="pcgamer"/> in addition to killing any residents that are armed.<ref name="polygon"/> Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: [[permadeath]].<ref name="pcgamer"/><ref name="rock2"/>

==Development==
===Conception and design===
''The Castle Doctrine'' was created by [[indie video game development|indie]] developer Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family.<ref name="gamasutra">{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/197707/ |title= The strange, sad anxiety of Jason Rohrer's The Castle Doctrine |date= 6 August 2013 |accessdate= 4 February 2014 |first= Leigh |last= Alexander |work= [[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>  The game's central theme is the [[castle doctrine]] and includes the issue of [[gun rights]]; Rohrer created it partially as an "[[art game|artistic statement]]" on defending one's family through violence.<ref name="rock2"/> He summarized his goals with the game as creating something "that makes you feel violated and makes you want to protect stuff that<U+2019>s yours, and puts you in the process of securing what<U+2019>s yours." However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical<U+2014>since they are invading others' homes as well<U+2014>was partially intentional and an "elegant" idea.<ref name="rock2"/>

Rohrer noted in an interview his aversion to creating a "ridiculous caricature of some post-apocalyptic man<U+2019>s world, where we<U+2019>ll all just robbing each other," and instead called his game [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|pre-apocalyptic]] in setting and style. In terms of aesthetics, Rohrer aimed for a "very clean, no frills, no fluff, no filler kind of design" that emphasized function in all of its objects. He has noted that some players have complained about not being able to decorate their houses non-functionally, but is unsympathetic, saying that the game is not ''[[FarmVille]]''. The game was, however, influenced by ''[[Minecraft]]'', which<U+2014>while heavily tied to cosmetic decoration<U+2014>involves similar themes of protecting one's creations from other players as in ''The Castle Doctrine''.<ref name="rock2"/>

Rohrer thought of adding family members for the player's character early in the game's development, but scrapped it at first because of the extra complexity and not knowing how to make them more than inanimate objects. After a dream, however, he was inspired to see if there was a practical way to implement them that would further the game's "moral dimension."<ref name="rock2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/01/rohrer-on-the-castle-doctrine-guns-chain-world-pt-2/|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Rohrer On The Castle Doctrine, Guns & Chain World, Pt 2|date=February 1, 2013|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>

===Testing and releases===
''The Castle Doctrine'' was first released as a [[Early access|paid alpha]] and sold at half-price from March 2013 until its official release on January 29, 2014.<ref name="rps">{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/13/its-a-steal-castle-doctrine-alpha-released/ |title= It<U+2019>s A Steal: Castle Doctrine Alpha Released |date= March 13, 2013 |accessdate= 5 February 2014 |first= Alec |last= Meer |publisher= [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]}}</ref><ref name="polygon"/> As was visible through its history of updates during [[software release life cycle|beta testing]], it went through several changes that increased its difficulty during development. One was the addition of dedicated "perma-perma-death" servers, where players could not even re-create characters after dying, in contrast to the game's generic "perma-death" servers. Another was "blueprints," which allow players to get a general sense of a house's layout before entering and thus encourage setting up puzzle-based<U+2014>rather than luck-based<U+2014>vault defenses.<ref name="rock">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/06/05/die-hardest-perma-perma-death-in-the-castle-doctrine/#more-155487|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=June 5, 2013|last=Meer|first=Alec|title=Die Hardest: Perma-Perma-death in The Castle Doctrine|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref> Rohrer did not, however, want the game to be impossible, so he took the step of forcing players to evade their own traps before the houses would be accessible to others.<ref name="rock2"/>

Upon release, the game's 50% discount was scaled back to 25% for one week. It has not gone on sale since, as Rohrer believes that "sales screw your fans" as they discourage buying games one wants during non-sale periods.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/01/15/sales-screw-your-fans-says-castle-doctrine-dev/ |title= <U+201C>Sales screw your fans,<U+201D> says Castle Doctrine dev |date= January 15, 2014 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |first= Brenna |last= Hillier |work= [[VG247]]}}</ref> Following the game's release, Rohrer used $3,000 USD of alpha release earnings to fund a competition in which players could win money, paintings, gift cards, and other prizes by having the highest worth in-game houses.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2014/1/22/5335322/castle-doctrine-contest-real-money-prizes |title= The Castle Doctrine contest will reward in-game thieves with real money, home security gear |date= January 22, 2014 |accessdate= 5 February 2014 |first= Dave |last= Tach |work= [[Polygon (magazine)|Polygon]]}}</ref> The highest prize awarded was $316 USD.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2014/02/04/castle-doctrine-competition-winner-earns-316-through-digital-burglary/ |title= Castle Doctrine competition winner earns $316 through digital burglary |date= 4 February 2014 |accessdate= 5 February 2014 |first= Phil |last= Owen |work= [[VG247]]}}</ref>

''The Castle Doctrine'' received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator [[Metacritic]] of 59/100.<ref name="metacritic"/> Patrick Carlson of [[PC Gamer]] reviewed the game well, responding positively to the game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand, describing it as thoughtfully designed.<ref name="pcgamer"/> [[Game Informer]]'s Daniel Tack also rated the game well, commenting particularly on its creativity, stating though that he did not think the game was "deep enough to stay interesting for long."<ref name="gi"/> Writing for [[Destructoid]], Patrick Hancock shared Tack's opinion that the game was a good experience, but said he would find it hard to recommend.<ref name="destruct"/>

[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Russ Pitts found the game a frustrating exercise, his experience determined by the arbitrary quality of player designed houses, and hampered by the game's harsh consequences of failure.  Pitts felt the game valued its message over the player's time and yet found the message hard to take seriously; he would describe the game as the most disturbing he had ever played.<ref name="polygon"/><ref name=PittsTweet>{{cite web| url=https://twitter.com/russpitts/status/429386991365394432| title=Status update| author=Russ Pitts| date=2014-01-31| publisher=[[Twitter]]| accessdate=2014-02-10| quote=A review of the most disturbing game I've ever played. "The Castle Doctrine"}}</ref> Keza MacDonald, in her review at [[IGN]], shared these frustrations, finding that tackling player-constructed houses made the game over-reliant on trial and error. She also found it hard to empathize with the small, pixelated characters, leading her to believe that the game failed in "communicating much of a message".<ref name="IGN"/> Nick Capozzoli of [[GameSpot]] also gave the game a largely negative review, criticising the [[nihilism|nihilistic]] feel, and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to.<ref name="gs"/>
