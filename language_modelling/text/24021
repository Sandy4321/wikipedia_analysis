'''''The Magic Behind the Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors''''' (ISBN 1-578-06696-4) is a 367-page book by [[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]] and [[Alisa Persons]], chronicling the artistic achievements and history of [[cartoon]] voice actors from the past and the present. It was published by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in December 2004.

Drawn from dozens of personal interviews, the book features various biographies, anecdotes, credit listings, and photographs pertaining to thirty-nine of the hidden artists of [[show business]]. The featured biographies span many animation studios and production companies, and discuss many details about well-known and distinguished voice actors, such as ''[[Beavis and Butthead]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]]'' creator and lead voice artist [[Mike Judge]], who got his start as an engineer for a weapons contractor); [[Bart Simpson]]'s voice actress [[Nancy Cartwright]], an [[Ohio]] native who became the star prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of [[Daws Butler]] (voice artist for [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], and [[Quick Draw McGraw]]); and [[Wayne Allwine]] and [[Russi Taylor]], the real-life husband-and-wife duo who, at the time of this book's publication, were the current voice actors for [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and [[Minnie Mouse]], respectively.

In the earliest days of cartoons, voice actors were seldom credited for their work, and prior to 1990, voice actors' potential as real actors was overlooked even by the [[Screen Actors Guild]], with [[Mel Blanc]], the so-named "Man of 1,000 Voices," being the only voice actor known to the general public. Now, [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning celebrities clamor to guest star on animated television shows and features (often to the displeasure of dedicated voice actors such as [[Billy West]]); however, despite the crushing turnouts at signings for such television series as ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', most voice actors, even in 21st-century animation, continue to work in relative anonymity.
