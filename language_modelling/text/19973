'''Miles Straume''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Ken Leung]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.  Miles is introduced early in the [[Lost (season 4)|fourth season]] as a hotheaded and sarcastic [[Mediumship|medium]] as a crew member aboard the freighter called the ''Kahana'' that is offshore the island where most of ''Lost'' takes place.  Miles arrives on the island and is eventually taken captive by [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] (played by [[Terry O'Quinn]]), who suspects that those on the freighter are there to harm his fellow crash survivors of [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight 815 and expose the island to the general public.  Miles is on a mission to obtain [[Ben Linus]] ([[Michael Emerson]]); instead, he tries to cut a deal with Ben to lie to Miles's employer [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]) that Ben is dead.

The writers created the role of Miles specifically for Leung after seeing him guest star on ''[[The Sopranos]]''.  Leung was the only actor to read for the part.  They chose his name because it resembles "[[maelstrom]]", another word for a powerful whirlpool. Reaction to the character has been positive.

== Arc ==

Miles was born in March 1977.  As a child, he lives with his mother Lara Chang (Leslie Ishii) in Encino, California.  Miles does not know his father, only being told by his mother that he is dead and did not care about them when he was alive, forcing them to leave him when Miles is a baby.  Miles resents his father for never having been around and also has disdain for other fathers who mistreat their children.  At seven years old, Miles discovers that he can hear the thoughts from before their death of those who are dead.  He becomes a professional [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] and develops his ability so that he can access specific information from the deceased and can sometimes even communicate when a corpse is not present.  In early December 2004, when he is twenty-seven years old, Miles is hired for $1.6 million by Charles Widmore to go on a freighter called the ''Kahana'' to an uncharted island to retrieve a mass murderer named Ben Linus, as Widmore believes that Miles will be able to communicate with those whom he had killed and gain information regarding his location.  Before he leaves, Miles is briefly abducted by [[Characters of Lost#Miscellaneous characters|Bram]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) and his team. Bram claims to know about Miles's father and the source of his superpower and he warns Miles not to go on this mission, instead trying to convince Miles to join him.

===Season 4===

Miles is flown via helicopter from the freighter to the island on December 21 as part of a science team.  The next day on the island, Miles encounters the survivors of the September 22 [[Oceanic Airlines]] Flight 815, who are believed to be dead by the world at large.  Hostile and distrustful of the survivors for killing his colleague [[Characters of Lost#Widmore and employees|Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]), Miles is taken prisoner by 815 survivor [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] ([[Terry O'Quinn]]) and kept in a boathouse near a Barracks on the island.  The next day, Miles temporarily escapes and bargains with Ben, who has also been taken prisoner: Miles will tell Widmore that Ben is dead in exchange for $3.2 million, double what Widmore was paying him.  The Barracks are ransacked on December 27 by a mercenary team from the freighter, who murder six people.  Miles leaves with Sawyer, Claire and Aaron for their beach camp. On the way, Miles stumbles upon the dead bodies of Karl and Danielle Rosseau. Later that night Claire disappears into the jungle and Sawyer initially blames Miles.
Miles arrives on December 30, shortly before eight are rescued not far from the island, the freighter explodes and the mercenary team is killed by the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], the island's indigenous people under Ben's leadership.  Also that day, Ben moves the island through spacetime by turning a large frozen donkey wheel underground.

===Season 5===

The group on the beach begin flashing through time, landing in fourteen different times throughout the Island's past and future in the span of about a week before the wheel is turned again; however, according to fellow freighter science team member physicist [[Daniel Faraday]] ([[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]]), none of the past is changed because their suddenly appearing in various times is what had always happened.  The survivors settle in 1974, by which point only Miles, Faraday, former Other [[Juliet Burke]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]) and 815 passengers [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] ([[Josh Holloway]]) and [[Jin-Soo Kwon|Jin Kwon]] ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]) remain; [[Rose and Bernard|Rose Henderson]] ([[L. Scott Caldwell]]), [[Rose and Bernard|Bernard Nadler]] ([[Sam Anderson]]) and Vincent the dog (Pono) also survive, but they are physically separated and do not meet any of them again for three years until July 1977.  Miles and his group move into the Barracks and pseudonymously join the [[DHARMA Initiative]], an organization conducting scientific research while living there that would eventually be purged in 1992 by Ben and the Others.  Despite the option to board the DHARMA submarine and "go back to the real world", the survivors from 2004 stay on the island together in the hope that they can somehow return to the time that they knew. Miles becomes a security officer.  He discovers that his mother and father Dr. Pierre Chang live on the island as part of DHARMA and his father is even the man in the organization's station-specific orientation films; however, Miles does not approach or befriend his father, continuing to harbor resentment for his absence from much of Miles's life.

In July 1977, both thirty-year old security officer Miles and three-month old infant Miles are living on the island.  Four survivors, Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid from Flight 815 who had been rescued nearly three years earlier on December 30, 2004 arrive on the island in 1977 after flying near the island in late 2007 and also join DHARMA, Sayid being a prisoner on suspicion of being an Other.  Miles still stays distant from his father, but, after talking to Hurley during a late-night chore, witnesses a peaceful moment between his younger self and his father. Three days later, the groups from the future are exposed as liars.  The next morning, Faraday comes clean to Chang that they are from the future and warns of a catastrophic "incident" that is due to occur at the building site for the Swan, DHARMA's planned island station dedicated to electromagnetism.  He instructs Chang to evacuate the island of non-essential personnel, which he does, ordering his wife and baby Miles to leave him, shortly after finding out that adult Miles is his son and confronting him about it.  Here, Miles realizes that he himself caused his father to order his mother and his three-month old self to leave. Faraday theorizes that if "Jughead" <U+2013> a hydrogen bomb that is buried on the island <U+2013> is detonated at the Swan site by the underground electromagnetic pocket of energy, the timeline will be altered, preventing any of the group from the future from ever having come to the island in 2004, saving everyone who had died after they arrived.  The plan proceeds as planned, even though Miles expresses skepticism.  The antagonistic DHARMA members engage in a gunfight with Jack, believing him to be an Other, and Miles, Sawyer, Juliet, and Kate come to his aid.  When the Swan site goes haywire, Chang's arm is caught in the debris and Miles rushes to his side, saving him and calling him "Dad".  After he tells his father to run as far as possible from the site, the bomb is detonated and everything goes to white, leaving Miles's status uncertain.

===Season 6===

In the [[LA X|first episode]] of Season 6, Miles is revealed to have been returned to the future along with the other survivors. When Kate, Jack, Hurley and Jin go to the temple to save Sayid, Sawyer asks Miles to remain behind to help bury the now-deceased Juliet and to use his power to find out what she was trying to tell him before she died. He reluctantly agrees, and after a few seconds, tells Sawyer "it worked." 

He and Sawyer are captured shortly after by the Others. At this band of Others' headquarter, the Temple, he stays with Hurley, Jack, and Sayid, while Kate, Jin, and Sawyer escape. A few days later, after Jack and Hurley too escape, Miles is left behind with the "infected" Sayid and the Others when [[Claire Littleton]], too "infected," shows up to talk to the Others' spokesperson, Dogen ([[Hiroyuki Sanada]]). Kate, meanwhile, returns, hoping to find Claire.  Miles tells her Claire is held hostage.  Later that night, the [[John Locke (Lost)|Man in Black]], in the form of the [[Mythology of Lost|Smoke Monster]], ravages the Temple, killing anyone in its path. Miles and Kate flee but get separated; Miles shuts himself in a room, until Ilana, [[Frank Lapidus]], [[Sun-Hwa Kwon]], and Ben burst in to help him. They go through a secret passageway safely just as the Smoke Monster enters the room.

Miles uses his gift of medium to discover how Jacob died, and revealed to Ilana that Ben killed him. They arrive at the beach where the Oceanic Flight 815 survivors spent their struggle for survival, using it as shelter.  When confronting Ben later, Miles refuses the offered [[Eggtown|$3.2 million]] in exchange for freeing Ben from Ilana.  Ben is spared, however, and Miles then digs up [[Nikki and Paulo]]'s diamonds where they had been buried with them to compensate for his lack of money on the Island.

When Hurley, Jack, and Richard join their group, Miles is particularly happy to greet Hurley.  A few days later, Richard decides their mission is to stop the Man in Black from escaping; they are to destroy the Ajira Airways Flight 316 on the other Island, dubbed "Hydra Island," so that the Man in Black stays trapped in the area. However, Hurley destroys the remaining dynamite from an old ship shipwrecked on the Island, thinking it will save everyone.  An irate Richard and Hurley split the group up: one will go talk to the Man in Black, led by Hurley, while the other will search for more explosives, led by Richard.  Miles decides to follow Richard and Ben, telling Hurley that he has seen "that [[Man in Black (Lost)|thing]] in action," and that it doesn't want to talk.

Miles, Richard, and Ben go back to the barracks to get some C4 that Ben secretly kept in his closet behind the bookcase. When they get there Miles hears the screams of someone who has died. Richard says it is Ben's daughter Alex and says he buried her there after they left. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.

He then finds Richard Alpert in the jungle and radio's Ben on a walkie talkie that he gave him. When Richard gets up he says to Miles that they need to get back to Hydra Island and destroy the plane with the C4 that they still have; saying they have to finish what they started. 

Miles and Richard get to the boat they left at the dock. As they are undocking the boat he reveals to Richard that he is starting to age. When they are rowing to Hydra Island they spot Frank Lapidus drifting in the water in life vests. When they get him on the boat Frank proposes they leave the island on the plane before The Man in black comes. Richard and Miles agree. Miles then radio's Ben again, saying they have made it to Hydra Island and about his plan about the plane. As he is talking though Claire comes out from the bushes and shoots two warning shots to tell them not to come closer. Richard manages to calm her down but she refuses to go on the plane with them. Miles radio's a third time. Kate picks up. He says to her they are patching up the plane and getting ready to take off. He tells Kate about Claire not wanting to come with them. Kate then smashes the radio she has. Miles asks Frank how the plane was doing. Frank says he has to check the electrical outlet before they take off. Frank tells Miles to patch up the hydraulics of the plane. Miles goes off with two slips of paper and tape. Miles fixes the hydraulics with Richard. Richard tells him if he can fix it. Miles claims he does not believe in a lot of things, but he does believe in duct tape. Miles and Richard then rejoin Frank in the cockpit. 

With Richard and Miles in the cockpit Frank manages to turn the plane on the third time he tried to turn it on. Miles heads to the back to watch out for Sawyer and the others who want to come. Miles announces they are clear for take off. Miles closes the door to the plane. Frank then tells Richard and Miles to open the door back up again when he sees Kate and Sawyer. Miles opens the door and lets in Kate, Sawyer and Claire. After that Miles sits in the back with the others. Miles and the others smile at the sight of the island getting smaller and smaller in the distance.

===Afterlife===

Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island, resulting in a different background for Miles.  Instead of a professional [[mediumship|medium]], he is an officer of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] along with his partner, [[James "Sawyer" Ford|James Ford]]. A comment by Miles indicates that his father is still alive in this reality, working at a museum with Charlotte, who Miles sets up on a blind date with Ford. Although working well with James, Miles feels he lacks trust from him. He later gains access to James' credit card account and learns his partner did not go to [[Palm Springs]] like he said, instead going to Australia. Angrily demanding answers, Miles make James eventually informing him of [[Characters of Lost|Anthony Cooper]]'s con. Miles objects to James' intention to kill Cooper, until a car crashes into theirs. The two cops pursue the hit-and-run driver, who is revealed to be [[Kate Austen|Kate]].

After receiving a surveillance tape showing [[Sayid Jarrah]] [[Sundown (Lost)|leaving the scene of a crime]], Miles informs James of this and together they go to the location of Sayid's whereabout, the home of his sister-in-law, Nadia.  While Miles blocks the front door, James catches Sayid and arrests him at the back.
