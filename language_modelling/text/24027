'''Conch''', pronounced ''conk'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/k<U+0252><U+014B>k/}}),<ref name=speaking>[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1995/vp950122/01210034.htm  Speaking the Conch Lingo in Key West] URL retrieved [[June 13]], [[2007]]</ref> is a [[slang]] term for native [[Bahamians]] of European descent.

Several theories have been proposed for the origin of the term:
*After the [[American Revolution]], many [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] migrated to the [[Bahamas]]. Being more affluent and educated than the earlier settlers, the loyalists came to look down on the early settlers, and called them ''conchs'' because that shellfish was a prominent part of their diet.
*The Bahamians told the [[United Kingdom|British]] authorities that they would ''eat conch'' before paying taxes levied by [[the Crown]].
*The adventurers from [[St. Augustine, Florida]] (then part of British [[East Florida]]) who recaptured [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] from the [[Spain|Spanish]] in 1782 hoisted a flag with a shell rampant on a field of canvas.<ref name=Foster>Foster, Charles C. 1991.

==Use in Florida==
===Florida Keys===
By extension, the term "Conch" has also been applied to the descendants of Bahamian immigrants in [[Florida]]. Bahamians began visiting the [[Florida Keys]] in the Eighteenth Century to catch turtles, cut timber and salvage wrecks.  During the Nineteenth Century and the first half of the Twentieth Century most of the permanent residents in the [[Florida Keys]] outside of [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and many in Key West, were Bahamian in origin.

The white Bahamians in the keys continued to be known as "conchs".  Other residents of the Florida Keys, especially in Key West, began applying the term "Conch" to themselves, and it is now applied generally to all residents of Key West.

ISBN 1-56164-101-4</ref>  To distinguish between natives and non-natives, the terms "Salt Water Conch" (native) and "Fresh Water Conch" (non-native) have been used.<ref name=speaking/>

===Elsewhere in Florida===
[[Riviera Beach, Florida]] was known as "Conchtown" in the first half of the Twentieth Century because of the number of Bahamian immigrants who settled there. Unlike the situation in Key West and the rest of the Florida Keys, where being ''Conch'' became a matter of pride and community identification, ''Conch'' was used by outsiders (in particular the residents of [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]]) in a pejorative manner to describe the Bahamian community in Riviera Beach. The usage there also carried the connotation that at least some of the ''Conchs'' were of mixed racial heritage. As a result, some of the Bahamians in Riviera Beach denied being ''Conchs'' when interviewed in the late 1930s.<ref name=Foster/>

==Other Uses==
The term "Conchy Joe" is also sometimes used (derogatorily) to refer to a native Bahamian of European descent or a person of non-European or mixed descent who ''acts white''.<ref name=conchyjoe>[http://www.silvertorch.com/jottings/bahajots.html Bahamian expressions] URL retrieved [[April 5]] [[2006]]</ref>
