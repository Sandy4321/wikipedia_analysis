[[Image:Flag of Singapore.svg|thumb|250px|[[Image:FIAV 110000.svg|23px]] National Flag of Singapore. Flag ratio: 2:3]]

The '''National Flag of Singapore''' was adopted on [[3 December]] [[1959]]. It consists of two horizontal halves, red above white. In the upper left corner, a white [[crescent]] moon and five white stars form a circle. The moon represents a young nation, while the five stars symbolise democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.

==Origin==
For over 140 years (1819&ndash;1959), the [[Union Flag]] flew over [[Singapore]] when it was part of the [[British Empire]]. Upon Singapore being granted internal self-government by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], the National Flag of Singapore was unveiled at the installation of the new Head of State, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Negara]], on [[3 December]] [[1959]]. Also made public that day were the [[Coat of arms of Singapore|Coat of Arms of Singapore or State Crest]] and the [[Majulah Singapura|National Anthem]]. The Flag was conceived and created by a committee headed by the then [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]], Dr. [[Toh Chin Chye]]. The Flag was adopted as the National Flag upon Singapore's full independence on [[9 August]] [[1965]].<ref name=flag>{{cite web|title=National Symbols and References : The National Flag|url=http://www.sg/explore/symbols_flag.htm|work=Singapore Infomap|publisher=[[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (Singapore)|Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts]]|year=2004|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

==Elements of the Flag and their significance==
The National Flag consists of two equal horizontal sections, red above white. In the upper left [[Flag terminology|canton]] is a white crescent moon beside five white stars arranged in a circle. The red colour symbolises universal brotherhood and equality of man. The white colour signifies pervading and everlasting purity and virtue. The crescent moon represents a young nation on the ascendant, and the five stars stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.<ref>Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules (Cap. 296, R 1, 2004 Rev.

In 1969, Singaporean composer Lim Su Chong composed a song entitled ''Five Stars Arising'' which took as its theme the elements of the National Flag. The lyrics of the song speak of a new moon, five stars and a new flag "arising out of the stormy sea". The moon is "[y]outhful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil as can be", each of the stars is "a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to see" and the flag is "[c]rimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure and free".<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Stars Arising|url=http://www.singsingapore.org.sg/songs-lyric.asp?sid=27|publisher=Sing Singapore|year=2005|accessdate=2007-10-16}} See also [[List of Singaporean patriotic songs]].</ref>

==Guidelines for usage==
Previously, the Flag could only be flown during the month of August to mark National Day on [[9 August]]. Following requests by Singaporeans, guidelines for the use of the Flag were relaxed in 2006 to give people more ways of expressing their loyalty to Singapore during [[National day|National Day]] celebrations. The [[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (Singapore)|Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts]] permitted Singaporean residents to display the Flag from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period, and allowed Singaporeans to apply [[decal]]s and stickers bearing the Flag to themselves or their belongings.<ref>{{cite news|author=Noor Mohd Aziz|title=Rules relaxed for flying national flag|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/218249/1/.html|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=[[2006-07-10]]}}</ref> The period when the Flag may be displayed has now been extended to a three-month period from July to September.<ref name=guidelines>{{cite web|title=National Symbols and References : The National Flag &ndash; Guidelines|url=http://www.sg/explore/symbols_flag_guideline.htm|work=Singapore Infomap|publisher=[[Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (Singapore)|Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts]]|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>
