'''HMS ''Cerberus''''' was a 32-gun [[fifth-rate]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She served in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in the Channel, the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and even briefly in the Baltic against the Russians. She participated in one boat action that won for her crew a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal (NGSM). She also captured many privateers and merchant vessels. Her biggest battle was the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]], which won for her crew another clasp to the NGSM. She was sold in 1814.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
''Cerberus'' was launched in September 1794 by Henry Adams, of [[Bucklers Hard]].  Her first commander was Captain J. Drew, who took command of her in January 1795 for the Irish station.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), pp.145-6.</ref>  

On 29 March 1795 she was sailing with [[HMS Santa Margarita (1779)|''Santa Margarita'']] when the two engaged and captured the 18-gun ''Jean Bart'' in the English Channel. The [[Royal Navy]] subsequently took the ''Jean Bart'' into service as {{HMS|Arab|1795|2}}. 

Among the ships that shared in the prize money for the recapture of the ship ''Caldicot Castle'' and ''Jean Bart'' on 28 and 30 March were {{HMS|Astraea|1781|2}}, {{HMS|London|1766|2}}, {{HMS|Colossus|1782|2}}, {{HMS|Robust|1764|2}}, {{HMS|Hannibal|1786|2}}, ''Valiant'', {{HMS|Thalia|1782|2}}, ''Cerberus'' and ''Santa Margarita''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13956|startpage=1159|endpage=1160|date=29 Nov 1796}}</ref> 

In July 1796, Cerberus and ''Seahorse'' took the privateer cutter ''Calvados'' (or ''Salvados''). ''Calvados'' carried six guns and ten [[Swivel gun|swivels]], and had a crew of 38 men. She was ten days out of [[Brest, France]], but had not made any captures.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13920|date=9 August 1796|startpage=783}}</ref>

Joined by ''Diana'', ''Cerberus'' and ''Seahorse'' captured the 14-gun privateer ''Indemnit<U+00E9>'' on 28 August. ''Indemnit<U+00E9>'', of Boulogne, was pierced for 14 guns but carried ten. She had a crew of 68 men.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=925|issue=13936|date=27 September 1796}}</ref>

On 14 September 1796, ''Cerberus'', {{HMS|Seahorse|1794|2}} and {{HMS|Diana|1794|2}} captured the Brazilian ship ''Santa Cruz''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15224|date=21 January 1800|startpage=72}}</ref>

Also in September, ''Cerberus'' captured the French privateer cutter ''Didon''. ''Didon'' was armed with four brass 4-pounder guns, [[Swivel gun|swivels]] and small arms. She had a crew of 30 men and was nine days out of Greville, having taken nothing.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=3|issue=13967|date=31 December 1796}}</ref>

''Cerberus'', in company with {{HMS|Magnanime|1780|2}} and ''Diana'', chased the privateer brig ''Franklin'' into the hands of Sir [[John Borlase Warren]]'s squadron on 1 November. ''Franklin'' carried twelve 9-pounder guns and a crew of 80 men.<ref name=LG13954/> On 4 November ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ship ''Friendship'', from Cape of Good Hope.<ref name=LG13954/>

On 5 November, ''Cerberus'' took the privateer cutter ''Hirondelle'' (ex-''Sans Culotte''). ''Hirondelle'' was armed with ten 6-pounder guns of which she had thrown six overboard during the chase, and had a crew of 63 men.<ref name=LG13954>{{London Gazette|startpage=1133|endpage=1134|issue=13954|date=22 November 1796|2}}</ref> The next day ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ''Jackson Junior'', from Jamaica.<ref name=LG13954/> ''Hirondelle'', ''Franklin'' (or ''Franklyn'') and three privateers that ''Santa Margarita'' and {{HMS|Dryad|1795|2}} had captured had formed a small squadron that had left [[Brest, France|Brest]] to scour the English Channel.<ref name=LG13954/> 

On 11 May 1797, ''Cerberus'' was on her way back to Cork from convoying vessels towards Newfoundland and the West Indies when she captured the French privateer ''Dungerquoise''. ''Dunkerquoise'' had been armed with  eighteen 9-pounder guns but had thrown most overboard while ''Cerberus'' chased her. ''Dunquerquoise'' also had a crew of 100 men.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=459|issue=14011|date=20 May 1797}}</ref>

''Cerberus'' was in company with ''Diana'', when ''Diana'' took the cutter ''Neptune'' on 12 September and after a nine-hour chase. ''Neptune'' was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 55 men. She was three days out of Lorient and had taken no prizes.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=907|issue=14047|date=19 September 1797}}</ref> 
Five days later, ''Cerberus'' and ''Diana'' recaptured the ''Albion''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1107|issue=14066|date=18 November 1797}}</ref>

Then on 27 September, ''Cerberus'' brought into Cork the Spanish privateer schooner ''San Noberta''. ''San Norberta'' was armed with four carriage guns plus some [[Swivel gun|swivels]], and had a crew of 42 men. ''Cerberus'' also recaptured the Danish ship ''Graff Bernstorff'', which was carrying a cargo of iron and grain from St. Michael's to Lisbon.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=977|issue=14054|date=10 October 1797}}</ref> ''Cerberus'' shared in the prize money with ''Diana'' and {{HMS|Kangaroo|1795|2}}.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1203|issue=15412|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>

On 12 November ''Cerberus'' took the French privateer ''Epervier''. ''Epervier'' was armed with sixteen 4-pounder guns and had a crew of 145 men.<ref name=JamesII91>James (1837), Vol. 2, p.91.</ref> (The Royal Navy registered her as [[HMS Epervier (1797)|HMS ''Epervier'']], but never commissioned her.) The next day, ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ''Adelphi'',<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1217|issue=15090|date=18 December 1798}}</ref> prize to ''Epervier''. The day after that, ''Cerberus'' captured the French privateer ''Renard''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=749|issue=15048|date=17 August 1798}}</ref> ''Renard'' carried eighteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 189 men.<ref name=JamesII91/> 

''Cerberus'' also chased the privateer ''Buonaparte'' but failed to capture the French ship after ''Cerberus{{'}}''s studding sails and top gallant mast been carried away. ''Buonaparte'' was armed with 32 guns and had a crew of 250 men. Apparently, in order to escape ''Cerberus'', ''Buonaparte'' threw many of her guns and stores overboard, necessitating her return to Bordeaux.<ref name=JamesII91/>

On 11 January 1798 Captain Drew, his nephew Lieutenant James Drew, Captain John Pulling and some ten men in ''Cerberus{{'}}''s [[pinnace (ship's boat)|pinnace]] drowned in a boat accident in [[Plymouth]].<ref name=Winfield/><ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 11, p.168.</ref><ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 12, p.432.</ref> Captain [[James Macnamara]] (or M'Namara) replaced Drew. 

On 24 October, ''Cerberus'' and ''Diana'' captured the ''Duntzfelt''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=314|issue=15683|date=13 March 1804}}</ref> About seven weeks later, on 10 December ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ''General Woolf'' (or ''General Wolff'').<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1185|issue=15087|date=8 December 1798}}</ref> 

In July 1799 ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ''Philanthropist''.<ref name=LG15283>{{London Gazette|startpage=917|issue=15283|date=9 August 1800}}</ref> On 28 September, ''Cerberus'' captured the French [[letter of marque]] ''Echange''.  The ''Echange'' was pierced for 14 guns but carried only 10. She and her crew of 40 men were six days out of [[Bordeaux]] and she was sailing to [[San Domingo]] with a cargo of bale goods and wine.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1031|issue=15192|date=8 October 1799}}</ref>

On 8 October ''Cerberus'' captured the French schooner ''Esperance''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=763|issue=15272|date=1 July 1800}}</ref> Next day, ''Cerberus'' was among the many British ships that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the ''Nostra Senora de la Solidad''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=143|issue=15230|date=11 February 1800}}</ref> Seven days later,  {{HMS|Arethusa|1793|2}} and ''Cerberus'' captured the  ''Purissima Conceptione''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=174|issue=15232|date=18 February 1800}}</ref>

On 20 October, ''Cerberus'' encountered a Spanish convoy some eight or nine [[League (unit)|leagues]] off Cape Ortegal. The convoy comprised some 80 vessels escorted by four frigates and two brig-corvettes. At one time or another ''Cerberus'' engaged all the frigates, including firing from both broadsides at the same time. Outnumbered, ''Cerberus'' eventually withdrew, but not before she had captured and set fire to a brig from the convoy. Despite the often close action, ''Cerberus'' suffered only four men wounded.<ref>James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.359-60.</ref>

In July 1800, ''Cerberus'' recaptured the ''Active''.<ref name=LG15283/> On 13 September 1801, ''Cerberus'' sailed for Cowes to take troop from there to Jersey. She then was to proceed to Ireland.<ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 4, p.251.</ref>

==Napoleonic Wars==

Captain William Selby took command of ''Cerberus'' in April 1803.<ref name=Winfield/> On 13 August ''Cerberus{{'}}''s boats made an attack on Concalle Bay. There they captured a large fishing boat but had to abandon a sloop they had captured after she grounded. At Cas Bay another cutting out party captured seven fishing boats of 16-18 tons burthen each. As the prize crews brought the boats to Guernsey one was upset, drowning two crew men from ''Cerberus''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1050|issue=15612|date=16 August 1803}}</ref>

On 13 September ''Cerberus'' served as flagship to Admiral Sir [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|James Saumarez]]. Saumarez commanded a small squadron comprising the sloops of war [[French corvette Aurore (1799)|''Charwell'']] and {{HMS|Kite|1795|2}}, the schooner {{HMS|Ealing|1803|2}}, the cutter {{HMS|Carteret|1803|2}}, and the [[bomb vessel]]s {{HMS|Sulphur|1797|2}} and {{HMS|Terror|1803|2}}.<ref name=LG15622>{{London Gazette|startpage=1272|endpage=1273|issue=15622|date=20 September 1803}}</ref> The squadron massed for a bombardment of the port of [[Granville, Manche|Granville]] where there were some gunboats moored. The squadron bombarded the port several times over the next two days. On 15 September, as ''Cerberus'' was withdrawing, she grounded. For the three hours it took to refloat her nine gunboats harried her, but without effect.<ref name=LG15622/> When the rest of the squadron, came up they drove the gunboats away. The British retired with no information on what, if anything, the bombardment had achieved.<ref name=LG15622/>

''Cerberus'' was assigned to operate of the English and French coasts by 1804 and sailed from the Guernsey Roads on the afternoon of 25 January 1804.  She passed through the [[Little Russel]] and headed towards Cape la Hogue to reach and reconnoiter [[Cherbourg]] before nightfall.<ref name=LG15670/>  

As she neared the Cape, lookouts sighted a convoy of four armed vessels sailing eastwards.  The vessels then anchored, while the strong tides prevented ''Cerberus'' from closing them.  Captain Selby sailed slightly to the south until darkness fell.  The enemy force was then sighted sailing around the cape, close in shore.  ''Cerberus'' shadowed them until a squall drove them off the land and allowed ''Cerberus'' to engage them.<ref name=LG15670/>  

The British captured the French gun-vessel ''Chameau'', and drove another vessel onto the rocks.  The other two French vessels escaped. The ''Chameau'' was a new 300-ton ship. She was armed with four long 6-pounders and two swivels. She was under the command of Ensign Francis Gabiare, and carried a crew of 37 plus 21 armed soldiers.<ref name=LG15670>{{London Gazette|startpage=133|endpage=134|issue=15670|date=28 January 1804}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A captain's share of the prize money for the ''Chameau'' was <U+20A4>169 15[[shilling|s]] 4<U+00BD>[[pence|d]]; a seaman's share was 17s 3<U+00BC>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=732|issue=15710|date=12 June 1804}}</ref>|group=Note}} Head money for the unknown vessel was paid in May 1824.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth <U+20A4>18 15s 5<U+00BC>d; a fifth-class share, that of an able seaman, was worth 5s 6<U+00BE>d<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=790|issue=18027|date=12 May 1824}}</ref>|group=Note}}

===Action against privateers===
''Cerberus'' was later involved in another engagement, this time on 2 April 1805 off Madeira.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1652|issue=15985|date=20 December 1806}}</ref>  A strange sail was spotted at daylight and ''Cerberus'' gave chase, eventually overhauling and capturing her quarry.  The vessel was the [[privateer]] [[brig]] ''Bonheur'', of 114 tons. She was armed with 14 guns and had a crew of 46 men under the command of Francis Folliott. She had sailed 13 days earlier from [[Cherbourg]] but during her cruise she had only managed to make a single capture.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=434|issue=15794|date=2 April 1805}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The prize money for an able seaman was 8s 5<U+00BC>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1664|issue=15986|date=23 December 1806}}</ref>|group=Note}}

At some point ''Cerberus'' was under the temporary command of Lieutenant Baker while Selby was absent. Baker felt indisposed and went ashore at Guernsey where he died a few hours later.<ref>''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 15, p.264.</ref>

''Cerberus'' continued to serve in the Atlantic, escorting convoys to the West Indies. On 15 May 1806, while she was escorting one such convoy, dawn revealed a suspicious vessel hovering near the fleet.  Selby gave chase and after a six-hour pursuit captured the ''Aimable Theresa''. She was armed with two brass howitzers and had a crew of 18 men. She was carrying a cargo of wine and merchandise, and had left [[Santiago de Cuba]] three days previously.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=846|issue=15934|date=5 July 1806}}</ref>

===In the West Indies===
By December 1806 ''Cerberus'' was in the West Indies, and in company with {{HMS|Circe|1804|2}} was reconnoitering the ports of [[Guadeloupe]] and [[<U+00CE>les des Saintes]]. They found little of interest, except a 16-gun brig at <U+00CE>les des Saintes.  Selby left ''Circe'', under Captain Pigot to watch her, whilst he took ''Cerberus'' on a cruise.<ref name=LG16014>{{London Gazette|startpage=394|endpage=395|issue=16014|date=28 March 1807}}</ref> 

On 2 January, as the ''Cerberus'' was sailing between [[Martinique]] and [[Dominique]] lookouts sighted a privateer schooner, with a schooner and a sloop standing nearby. The three ships were heading for [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St. Pierre]]. ''Cerberus'' gave chase, cutting them off from the port and forcing them to anchor close to shore, under cover of a battery near the Pearl Rock.<ref name=LG16014/>  

A cutting out party, under Lieutenants Coote and Bligh was formed, including Mr Hall, [[master's mate]], Mr Sayer, Mr Carlwis and Mr Selby, midshipmen, Mr Collins, boatswain and Messers Horopka and Ratcove, two Russian gentlemen acting as midshipmen. They took the ''Cerberus{{'}}''s boats in under heavy cannon and small arms fire; they boarded the schooner and sloop and brought them out. The privateer schooner escaped in the darkness by using her sweeps.  Though the attack was successful, Lieutenant Coote was blinded and a musket ball hit George Sayer in the leg. Two men were killed, and eight more were wounded, one of whom died later.<ref name=LG16014/> The vessels captured or recaptured may have been a schooner of unknown name and the cutter ''Sally'' for which prize money was paid in September 1809.{{#tag:ref|A seaman's share of the prize money was 11s 6d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1527|issue=16299|date=19 September 1809}}</ref>|group=Note}}

''Cerberus'' remained in the West Indies through 1807 and into 1808. On April 1807 she was part of a squadron under the command of Admiral, the Honourable [[Sir Alexander Cochrane]], that captured the ''Telemaco''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=330|issue=16236|date=11 March 1809}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A seaman's share of the prize money was 2s 9d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=441|issue=16242|date=1 April 1809}}</ref>|group=Note}}

In September and October ''Cerberus'' captured several Danish vessels. On 30 September she captured the schooner ''Sylenus''.<ref name=LG16422/> On 6 October ''Cerberus'' captured the Danish ship ''Resolution''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1178|issue=16499|date=25 June 1811}}</ref> {{HMS|Cygnet|1804|2}} assisted at the capture.{{#tag:ref|The prize money for a seaman from ''Cerberus'' was <U+20A4>3 6s 16<U+00BC>d, while the prize money for a seaman from ''Cygnet'' was <U+20A4>3 4s 11<U+00BD>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1327|issue=16505|date=16 July 1811}}</ref> In both cases the prize money probably represented well over a month's wages.|group=Note}} That same day, ''Cerberus'' and ''Cygnet'' also captured the ''Fanny''.{{#tag:ref|The prize money for a seaman was 1s 2<U+00BE>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=986|issue=16606|date=23 May 1812}}</ref>|group=Note}} 

Next day, ''Cerberus'' captured the sloop (or [[galliot]]) ''Mary''.<ref name=LG16422/> On 23 October she captured the schooner ''Johanna Frederica''.<ref name=LG16422>{{London Gazette|startpage=1768|issue=16422|date=6 November 1810}}</ref> The brig {{HMS|Hart|1805|2}} assisted at the capture of the ''Mary''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1888|issue=16428|date=27 November 1810}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The prize money for a seaman for the ''Sylenus'', ''Mary'' and ''Johanna Frederica'' was, in order, 6s 8<U+00BD>d, 2s 10<U+00BC>d and 10<U+00BC>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1864|issue=16427|date=20 November 1810}}</ref> A second payment for the ''Mary'' amounted to 3s 11<U+00BD>d.

In early 1808 Captain Selby was the commander of the blockading squadron covering [[Pointe-<U+00E0>-Pitre]], Guadeloupe. He realized that the French privateers were using the batteries on [[Marie-Galante]] to shelter themselves and their prizes and decided to remedy the situation. He sent Pigot with 200 seamen and marines from ''Cerberus'', ''Circe'' and {{HMS|Camilla|1776|2}} to capture the island. Pigot landed his force early on 2 March some two miles from Grand Bourg and the garrison duly capitulated. The British also captured a number of cannons and some small arms.<ref name=LG16014>{{London Gazette|startpage=603|endpage=604|issue=16141|date=30 April 1808}}</ref> In 1825 {{HMS|Ulysses|1779|2}} shared in the prize money with the other three vessels.{{#tag:ref|A first-class share was worth [[<U+00A3>sd|<U+00A3>]]311 0s 5d; a fifth-class share was worth <U+00A3>1 13s 3<U+00BE>d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=423|issue=18116|date=12 March 1825}}</ref>|group=Note}}

''Cerberus'' remained in the area, and on 29 March and in company with {{HMS|Lily|1804|2}}, [[French brig Voltigeur (1804)|''Pelican'']], [[HMS Express (1800)|''Express'']], [[HMS Swinger (1804)|''Swinger'']] and [[HMS Mosambique (1804)|''Mosambique'']], sailed from Marie-Galante to attack the island of [[La D<U+00E9>sirade]].  They arrived on 30 March and sent in a landing party of seamen and marines from the vessels of the squadron, all under the overall command of Captain Sherriff of ''Lily''.  As the boats approached they exchanged fire with a battery of 9-pounder guns covering the entrance to the harbour.  The ships' guns silenced the battery and the French surrendered.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=661|issue=16144|date=10 May 1808}}</ref>

===The Baltic===
''Cerberus'' then returned to England and was paid off at [[Deptford]] later in 1808.<ref group=Note>Captain Selby took command of [[HMS Owen Glendower (1808)|''Owen Glendower'']] in February 1809 and died aboard her whilst at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] on 28 March 1811.</ref> Between August and 1808 and March 1809, ''Cerberus'' underwent a substantial repair and fitting at Deptford.<ref name=Winfield/>

''Cerberus'' was recommissioned in March 1809 under the command of Captain Henry Whitby.<ref name=Winfield/> She then sailed to the Baltic, where she participated in the [[Anglo-Russian War (1807-1812)|Anglo-Russian War]]. 

Thus on 25 July, 17 boats from a British squadron, consisting of ''Cerberus'', {{HMS|Princess Caroline|1807|2}}, {{HMS|Minotaur|1793|2}} and {{HMS|Prometheus|1807|2}} attacked a flotilla of four enemy gunboats and a brig off [[Asp<U+00F6>]] Head near Fredrickshamn (present<U+2013>day [[Hamina]], [[Finland]]), in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], [[Russia]]. Captain Forrest of ''Prometheus'' commanded the boats and succeeded in capturing gunboats Nos. 62, 65, and 66, and the transport brig No. 11. The action was sanguinary in that the British lost 19 men killed and 51 wounded, and the Russians lost 28 men killed and 59 wounded. Lieutenant Simpson commanded the ''Cerberus{{'}}''s boats, which had five seamen and two marines wounded in the operation.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1345|endpage=1347|issue=16291|date=22 August 1809}}</ref> In 1847 the Admiralty issued the NGSM with clasp "25 July Boat Service 1809" to surviving claimants from the action. ''Cerberus'' then moved to the Mediterranean in 1810.

The day before the boats of the squadron also captured Ruffian schooner ''Waffer''. The Russian transport brig the boats captured on 25 July appears to have been the  ''Nicholas Murioff''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1027|issue=16386|date=10 July 1810}}</ref>

===The Mediterranean===
On 14 June 1810 ''Cerberus'' was cruising in the Mediterranean in company with {{HMS|Active|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Swallow|1805|2}}. Together, the three British vessels captured three French gun-boats: ''Vincentina'', ''Modanese'' and ''Elvetica'' (or ''Elvetria'').<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2304|issue=16668|date=14 November 1812}}</ref>

Then on 28 June 1810 {{HMS|Amphion |1798|2}} intercepted a convoy from [[Trieste]]  and chased it into [[Grado, Italy|Grao]]. ''Amphion'' and ''Cerberus'' sent a number of boats into the harbour and after a brief struggle, captured the town, taking a number of French soldiers prisoner and discovering 25 vessels in the harbour.  Boats from ''Active'' reinforced the shore parties, enabling them repel, at bayonet point, a counter attack by more French troops.  On the evening of 29 June, the British sailed five prizes and a number of prisoners out of the harbour and on to [[Vis (island)|Lissa]]. The British burnt 11 vessels in the river, and 14 or 15 boats after removing their cargoes. The British had four men killed and eight wounded, with five of the wounded being from ''Cerberus''; the French lost 10 men killed and eight men wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1857|endpage=1859|issue=16427|date=20 November 1810}}</ref> 

Prize taking continued the following year when Captain Whitby discovered four vessels anchored at [[Pestichi]] on 4 February 1811.  He dispatched a number of barges from ''Cerberus'' and ''Active'' to capture them.  The British took three [[trabaccolo]]s, one the ''Carlo Grimaldi'',  and sent them off to [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], whilst burning a fourth after removing its cargo to ''Active''. In the action ''Active'' had one seaman badly wounded.<ref name=LG16490>{{London Gazette|startpage=996|endpage=998|issue=16490|date=28 May 1811}}</ref>   

On 12 February boats from ''Cerberus'' and ''Active'' set out to secure a number of vessels spotted moored at [[Ortano]].  As the boats attempted this, they came under heavy fire from shore positions but cleared all opposition. A party of marines and small arms men under the command of ''Active{{'}}''s lieutenant of marines landed to secure the shore to protect the cutting out operation. The carronades on ''Active{{'}}''s launches also provided cover. British casualties amounted to four men wounded. The British captured 11 Venetian vessels in all, most of which were from Ancona, bound for Corfu. The ones the British didn't burn they sent to Lissa.<ref name=LG16490/>

On 11 March, ''Cerberus'', along with ''Active'', {{HMS|Volage|1807|2}} and ''Amphion'' engaged an enemy force consisting of five frigates, a corvette, a brig, two schooners and a [[xebec]] in what became known as the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]].  The result was a British victory with the capture of two French ships and the burning of another. However, the British lost 50 men killed and 150 men wounded. ''Cerberus'' alone lost 13 killed and 44 wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=892|endpage=896|issue=16485|date=14 May 1811}}</ref> In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the NGSM with clasp "Lissa" to all surviving claimants form the action.

''Cerberus'' came under the command of Captain Robert Clephane in June 1811.<ref name=Winfield/> Command then passed to Captain [[Thomas Garth (Royal Navy)|Thomas Garth]] in December.<ref name=Winfield/>  

On 16 June 1812 boats from {{HMS|Unite|1796|2}}, {{HMS|Orlando|1811|2}} and ''Cerberus'' captured three vessels of from eighty to one hundred tons in the small port of [[Badisco|Badisea]], near Otranto. A little over a month later, on 17 July, boats from {{HMS|Achille|1798|2}} and ''Cerberus'' captured or destroyed, off Venice, 12 enemy trabaccolos.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2017|issue=16654|date=3 October 1812}}</ref>

On 29 January 1813, boats from ''Cerberus'' captured a [[trabaccolo]] of two guns, sailing to [[Corfu]], heavily laden with a cargo of corn and flour.<ref name=LG16749/> This was probably the ''Madonna della Grazzia'', captured on that day and for which ''Cerberus'' received prize money a little over 25 years later.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=796|issue=19602|date=30 March 1838}}</ref> 

Then on 13 March, she took the French gunboat ''Veloce'', which was armed with one 18-pounder and which had a crew of 22 men. She was sailing with money for the troops at Corfu.<ref name=LG16749/> Lastly, the boats brought out a large trabaccolo from under a battery near [[Brindisi]].<ref name=LG16749>{{London Gazette|issue=16749|startpage=1308|date=3 July 1813}}</ref>

On 27 February, ''Cerberus'' and ''Achille'' were in company when they captured the brig ''Centauro''.{{#tag:ref|A first class share for ''Achille'' was worth <U+20A4>123 7s 10<U+00BC>d and a first-class share for ''Cerberus'' was worth <U+20A4>126 12s 11<U+00BC>d.

On 19 March, boats from ''Cerberus'' and {{HMS|Apollo|1805|2}} destroyed several vessels, a battery and a tower three miles northwest of the port of [[Monopoli]] near [[Bari]].<ref name=LG16758/> Then on 11 April, ''Apollo'' and ''Cerberus'' took Devil's Island, near the north entrance to Corfu, and thereby captured a brig and a trabaccolo bringing in grain.<ref name=LG16758/> On 14 April the boats chased a vessel into Merlera. They then suffered three men wounded before ''Apollo'' arrived and helped them capture the island. There they found eight vessels with cargoes of flour and grain, but scuttled.<ref name=LG16758>{{London Gazette|issue=16758|startpage=1486|date=27 July 1813}}</ref>

On 17 May boats from ''Apollo'' and ''Cerberus'' took a vessel that ran aground near Brindisi. She was armed with a 9-pounder gun in the bow and a swivel gun. She was sailing from Otranto to Ancona.<ref name=LG16772/> The next day the boats also brought off a gun from a [[Martello tower]] a little further to the south.<ref name=LG16772/> Then ten days later the boats captured three gunboats at [[Fano]] that were protecting a convoy. The gun-boats each had a 9-pounder in their bows and two 4-pounder guns abaft. They were under the command of an Ufficiale di Vascello, carrying troops for Corfu. The British also captured four vessels from the convoy. British losses amounted to two men killed and one wounded.<ref name=LG16772>{{London Gazette|issue=16772|startpage=1794|endpage=1795|date=11 September 1813}}</ref> 

''Cerberus'' spent much of the first half of 1814 in the [[Gulf of Venice]]. However, on 16 January the French frigate ''Uranie'' escaped from Ancona. ''Cerberus'' chased her into Brindisi. He did not pursue her further as Brindisi owed allegiance to the Kingdom of Naples, an English ally. When ''Apollo'' arrived, the Frenchman unloaded the power from ''Uranie'' and set her on fire.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16876|startpage=700|date=2 April 1814}}</ref>

==Fate==
''Cerberus'' then returned to England. She was lying at Sheerness when the Navy Office offered her for sale on 14 September.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16936|startpage=1899|date=20 September 1814}}</ref> She was sold on 29 September 1814 for <U+20A4>2,800.<ref name=Winfield/>
