==Biography==
===Early years===

Max Hayes was born in [[Havana, Ohio|Havana]], [[Huron County, Ohio|Huron County]], [[Ohio]] on May 25, 1866, the son of a farmer.<ref name="ALWW">Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 100.</ref> Hayes was largely self-educated, only attending school through the 4th grade and going to work at age 14.<ref name="ALWW" />

A printer by trade, Hayes worked on the staff of the ''Cleveland Press'' from 1881 to 1890. He was a member of the [[International Typographical Union]] since 1884.<ref name="ALWW" />

In 1890, Hayes founded and edited a labor newspaper of a decidedly [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] bent, ''The Cleveland Citizen.''<ref name="ALWW" /> He remained active as editor of this weekly publication until 1939.

===Political career===

In 1890, Hayes joined the [[Populist Party (United States)|People's Party]], of which he was a member until 1896.<ref name="ALWW" /> Hayes then joined the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] (SLP), serving as the Secretary of Section Cleveland, SLP. He left the SLP during the split of the anti-[[Daniel DeLeon]] and pro-[[American Federation of Labor]] dissident faction headed by [[Henry Slobodin]] and [[Morris Hillquit]] in 1899.<ref name="ALWW" /> Although Hayes was an vocal opponent of [[Samuel Gompers]] in the AF of L, he nevertheless was even more opposed to the SLP's [[Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance]] (ST&LA), which he believed to be [[sectarianism|sectarian]] and destructive.

In 1900 Hayes was nominated for Vice President of the United States by the Hillquit faction in 1900, but withdrew in favor of the candidacy of [[Job Harriman]] in a unity ticket that brought together the the former-SLP dissidents with the Chicago-based [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Social Democratic Party of America]] of [[Eugene V. Debs]] and [[Victor L. Berger]].<ref name="ALWW" /> Hayes was a Socialist candidate for [[U.S. Congress]] in that year.<ref name="ALWW" /> In the next election cycle, that of 1902, Hayes stood as the Socialists' candidate for Ohio Secretary of State.<ref name="ALWW" />

In 1903, Hayes was chosen as the delegate of the AF of L to the convention of the British [[Trades Union Congress]].<ref name="ALWW" />

Hayes was a bitter opponent of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] from the time of its founding in 1905, lending his support instead to the AF of L. In 1911 Hayes challenged Gompers for the AF of L Presidency at the organization's annual convention, polling 30 percent of the convention vote in a losing effort.

Hayes was an opponent of the aggressively [[antimilitarist]] 1917 [[St. Louis resolution]] of the Socialist Party. He did not resign from that organization until May of 1919, however. Hayes then joined the fledgling [Farmer-Labor Party and was named to the national ticket as candidate for Vice President of the United States, running with the group's Presidential nominee, [[Parley Parker Christensen]]. He was active in the [[Conference for Progressive Political Action]] (CPPA) from 1922 to 1924.

==Death and legacy==

Hayes died in Cleveland on October 11, 1945.

The Max S. Hayes papers are held by the [[Ohio Historical Society]] and are available through interlibrary loan in microfilmed form.
