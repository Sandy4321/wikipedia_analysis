'''''The Division Bell''''' is the twelfth and last [[recording studio|studio]] [[album]] by English [[progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]].  It was released in the UK by [[EMI Records]] in March 1994, and shortly after in the US by [[Columbia Records]]. 

Written mostly by guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], the album deals mostly with themes of communication.  Recording took place in a number of locations, including the band's [[Britannia Row Studios]], and Gilmour's [[houseboat]], ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]''.  The production team included Pink Floyd stalwarts such as producer [[Bob Ezrin]], engineer [[Andy Jackson]], and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]].  Gilmour's new wife, [[Polly Samson]], co-wrote many of the album's lyrics, and Wright performed his first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since 1973's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.

The album went to number one in the UK and US, but received generally poor reviews.  Former band-mate [[Roger Waters]], when asked to comment, slated the album.  Its release was followed immediately by a tour of the US, Europe, and the UK.  ''The Division Bell'' was certified [[Gold record|Gold]], [[Platinum record|Platinum]], and Double Platinum in the US in June 1994, and triple Platinum in January 1999.

==Concept==
Much of the album deals with themes of communication<U+2014>the idea that talking can solve more of life's problems.<ref name="Blakep365">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=365}}</ref>  Songs such as "[[Poles Apart]]" and "[[Lost for Words (song)|Lost for Words]]" are occasionally interpreted as references to the long-standing estrangement between former band-member Roger Waters and Pink Floyd, however Gilmour has denied that the album is an [[allegory]] for the split.  In 1994 he said: "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's a little late at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up."<ref name="pinkfloydpride">{{Citation | last = Morse | first = Steve | title = Pink Floyd pride and drive keep band on top with No. 1 album and 60-show tour | url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EADE0D25AAA5012&p_docnum=1&p_queryname=2 | publisher = ''Boston Globe'', hosted at infoweb.newsbank.com | format = Registration required | date = 1994-05-12 | accessdate = 2010-01-14}}</ref>  The general theme of communication is reflected in the choice of name for the album; ''The Division Bell'' was inspired by the [[division bell]] rung in the UK [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Houses of Parliament]], to indicate that a vote, or [[Division (vote)|division]], is to take place.<ref name="Mabbettp119">{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|pp=119,&nbsp;123}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The bell used at the end of the album is not the bell used in Parliament|group="nb"}}  Drummer Nick Mason expanded on this in 1994, when he opined "it does have some meaning.

Using communication as a theme allowed Gilmour to deal with the breakdown of his first marriage to Virginia "Ginger" Hasenbein, in "[[Coming Back To Life]]", and the lingering ghost of former band-mate [[Syd Barrett]] in "Lost for Words".<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=260}}</ref>  Produced only a few years after the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]], the song "[[A Great Day for Freedom]]" juxtaposes the general euphoria of, for instance, the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], with the ethnic cleansing and genocide that followed, particularly in the former [[Yugoslavia|state]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{Citation | last = Cosyns | first = Simon | title = "Echoes brought Rick out of his shell ... we had musical telepathy" | url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/1734926/Pink-Floyds-David-Gilmore-Echoes-brought-Rick-out-of-his-shell.html | publisher = thesun.co.uk | date = 2008-09-26 | accessdate = 2010-01-17}}</ref>  Audio samples of Professor [[Stephen Hawking]] provide the spoken word portions of "Keep Talking".<ref name="pinkfloydpride"/>  Gilmour had first heard the professor's words on a British television advertisement, and was so moved by Hawking's sentiment that he contacted the company which made the advertisement to get permission to use the recordings on the album.<ref name="Redbeard1994">{{Citation | title = In the Studio with Redbeard | date = 1994-03-31}}</ref>  Emphasising the general theme of poor communication, at the end of the album Gilmour's stepson Charlie can be heard hanging up the telephone receiver on Pink Floyd manager [[Steve O'Rourke]], who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=123}}</ref>  ''[[In the Studio (radio show)|In the Studio]]'' radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace."<ref name="Redbeard">{{Citation | title = In the Studio with Redbeard | url = http://www.inthestudio.net/ | publisher = inthestudio.net | date = 2009-08-17}}</ref>

==Recording==
[[Image:AstoriaHouseboat.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'']]
In January 1993 Gilmour, Mason, and Wright together began ad-libbing new material, in sessions at a remodelled Britannia Row Studios.  Although the band were initially apprehensive about recording together, after the first day their confidence improved and soon, bassist [[Guy Pratt]] (who had, since the end of the ''Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour'', become an item with Wright's daughter, Gala Wright)<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=356}}</ref> was asked to contribute.  According to Mason, "an interesting phenomenon occurred, which was that Guy's playing tended to change the mood of the music we had created on our own."<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=315}}</ref>  Without the legal problems experienced during production of their 1987 album, ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', Gilmour was at ease; if he felt the band were "getting somewhere", he would press the record key on a two-track [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT recorder]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=354}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Di Perna|2002|p=86}}</ref>  At one point Gilmour surreptitiously recorded Wright playing the keyboard, and captured material which later formed the basis for three pieces of music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=314<U+2013>315}}</ref>

The improvisations the band recorded helped spur their creative process, and after about two weeks they had around 65&nbsp;pieces of music.  With engineer [[Andrew_Jackson_(recording_engineer)|Andy Jackson]] back on the team, and [[Bob Ezrin]] employed as co-producer, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, ''Astoria''.  The band listened to and voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27&nbsp;pieces of music.{{#tag:ref|Mason (2005) also writes that they had enough left-over material to create a separate release, which he called ''The Big Spliff''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=316}}</ref>|group="nb"}}  Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they eventually arrived at a list about 15-strong, before cutting another&nbsp;4 to produce a tracklist of 11&nbsp;songs.   Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song<U+2014>a system skewed somewhat by Wright's decision to award his songs ten points each, and the other songs no points.<ref name="Mason314321">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=314<U+2013>321}}</ref>  The keyboardist was not contractually a full member of the band, a situation which clearly upset him; Wright later reflected: "It came very close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair."<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|p=355}}</ref>  Despite his frustration, however, he chose to remain, and received his first song-writing credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|pp=354<U+2013>355}}</ref>

Gilmour's new wife, [[Polly Samson]], also received song-writing credits.  Initially, her role was limited to providing encouragement for her husband, but she later helped Gilmour write "[[High Hopes (Pink Floyd song)|High Hopes]]" (a song about Gilmour's childhood and early life in [[Cambridge]]).  Her role expanded to co-writing a further six songs, something which did not sit well with Ezrin.  In an interview for ''Mojo'' magazine Gilmour admitted that Samson's contributions had "ruffled the management's [feathers]", but Ezrin later reflected that her presence was inspirational for Gilmour, and that she "pulled the whole album together".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2005|pp=355<U+2013>356}}</ref>  She also helped Gilmour, who, following his divorce, had developed a cocaine habit.<ref name="Blakep365"/>

Keyboard player Jon Carin, and Gary Wallis were brought in to complete the band, before recording began.  Five backing vocalists were also hired, including [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]], and ''Momentary Lapse'' tour singer [[Durga McBroom]].  The band then moved to [[Olympia Studios]], recorded most of the 'winning' tracks over the space of a week.  After a summer break, they returned to ''Astoria'' to record more backing tracks.  Ezrin worked on the various drum sounds, and previous collaborator and orchestral composer [[Michael Kamen]] provided the album's string arrangements.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=318<U+2013>319}}</ref>  [[Dick Parry]] played saxophone on his first Pink Floyd album for almost twenty years, on "[[Wearing the Inside Out]]", and [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] was booked to undertake the final mix.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=356<U+2013>357}}</ref>  Between September and December recording and mixing sessions were held at Metropolis Studios in [[Chiswick]], and The Creek Recording Studios in London.  In September, the band performed at a celebrity charity concert at [[Cowdray Castle]], in [[Midhurst]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=257}}</ref>  The album was mastered at the Mastering Lab in [[Los Angeles]], by [[Doux Sax]] and [[James Guthrie]].{{#tag:ref|See sleeve notes.|group="nb"}}

===Instrumentation===
With the aid of Gilmour's guitar technician, Phil Taylor, Carin managed to locate some of the band's older keyboards from the warehouse in which they had been stored, including a [[Farfisa]] organ.  Some of the sounds sampled from these instruments were used on the tracks "[[Take It Back]]", and "[[Marooned (song)|Marooned]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=357}}</ref>  Carin was joined on keyboards by Ezrin, [[Durga McBroom]] supplied backing vocals alongside Sam Brown, Carol Kenyan, Jackie Sheridan, and Rebecca Leigh-White.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=120}}</ref>

Gilmour used several styles on the album.  "[[What Do You Want from Me (Pink Floyd song)|What Do You Want from Me]]" is heavily influenced by [[Chicago blues]], "[[Poles Apart]]" contains folksy overtones.  Gilmour's heavily improvised guitar solos on "[[Marooned (song)|Marooned]]" used a [[Digitech Whammy]] pedal to pitch-shift the guitar notes over a full octave.  On "Take It Back" he used an [[EBow]] (an electronic device which simulates the sound of a [[bowed guitar|bow on the strings]], on a [[Gibson J-200]] guitar through an effects unit.<ref name="Di Pernapp8385">{{Harvnb|Di Perna|2002|pp=83<U+2013>85}}</ref>

==Packaging==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | quote = The album feels much more home-made, very much as a band playing together in once space.  I think that Rick in particular felt significantly more integrated in the process this time, compared to ''Momentary Lapse''.

Keen to avoid competing against other album releases (as had happened with ''A Momentary Lapse'') Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would begin a new tour.  By January of that year however, the band still had not decided on a title for the album.  The list of names being considered included ''Pow Wow'' and ''Down to Earth''.  At a dinner one night, writer [[Douglas Adams]], spurred on by the promise of a <U+00A3>5,000 payment to his favourite charity, the Environmental Investigation Agency, suggested ''The Division Bell'' (used in the lyrics for "High Hopes"), and the name stuck.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=319<U+2013>320}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|pp=119<U+2013>120}}</ref>

Long-time Floyd collaborator Storm Thorgerson provided the album artwork.  He erected two large metal heads each the height of a [[Double-decker bus]] in a field near [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]].  The sculptures were positioned close together, and photographed in profile, to give the illusion that not only were they either facing or talking to each other, they also presented the viewer with a third face.  The sculptures were devised by Keith Breeden, and constructed by John Robertson.  [[Ely Cathedral]] is visible on the horizon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=320}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | title = Division Bell - Metal Heads | url = http://www.hypergallery.com/prints/division-bell---metal-heads-25.html | publisher = hypergallery.com | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}</ref>  The sculptures are now in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

The album was released in the UK and US on CD, vinyl, and [[Compact Cassette]], each with its own format and label-specific design.  Two {{convert|7.5|m|adj=on}} stone sculptures were made by Aden Hynes{{#tag:ref|See sleeve notes.|group="nb"}} for the cassette releases, and photographed in the same style as the metal heads.  The artwork inside the CD lyric booklet revolves around a similar theme, with the image of the two heads formed by various other objects, such as newspapers ("A Great Day for Freedom"), coloured glass ("Poles Apart"), and boxing gloves ("Lost for Words").  Pages two and three portray a picture from [[La Silla]] observatory.

On 10&nbsp;January 1994 a press reception to announce the new album and world tour was held at a former [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City|US Naval Air Station]] in [[North Carolina]], in the US.  A purpose-built [[Skyship 600]] [[airship]], manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27&nbsp;June.  Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs.  The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21&nbsp;March.  This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted to look like a fish, which took journalists on a tour of London.  The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.<ref name="Poveyp270">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=270}}</ref>

The album was released in the UK by [[EMI Records]] on 28&nbsp;March 1994,{{#tag:ref|UK EMI EMD 1055 (vinyl), EMI CD EMD 1055 (CD)<ref name="Poveyp350">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=350}}</ref>|group="nb"}} and in the US on 4&nbsp;April,{{#tag:ref|US Columbia C 64200 (vinyl), Columbia CK 64200 (CD)<ref name="Poveyp350"/>|group="nb"}}<ref name="Poveyp270"/> and went straight to number one in both countries.<ref name="Blakep359">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=359}}</ref>  ''The Division Bell'' was certifed Silver and Gold in the UK on 1&nbsp;April 1994, Platinum a month later, and 2* Platinum on 1&nbsp;October.

Despite strong sales however, the critical reception was poor.<ref name="rollingstone">{{Citation | last = Graves | first = Tom | title = The Division Bell | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/219753/the_division_bell | publisher = rollingstone.com | date = 1994-06-16 | accessdate = 2010-01-03}}</ref>  [[Amazon.com]] writer Jerry McCully wrote "''The Division Bell'' is not a great Pink Floyd album, but an all-too-fallible simulation".<ref>{{Citation | last = McCully | first = Jerry | url = http://www.amazon.com/Division-Bell-Pink-Floyd/dp/B000002A3T | title = The Division Bell | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}</ref> Tom Sinclair of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' echoed his sentiment, grading the album "D", and writing that "avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling".<ref name="Tomsinclair">{{Citation | last = Sinclair | first = Tom | title = The Division Bell | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301952,00.html | publisher = ew.com | date = 1994-04-22 | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}</ref>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s Tom Graves criticised Gilmour's performance, stating that his guitar solos "were once the band's centrepieces, as articulate, melodic and well-defined as any in rock, [but] he now has settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible", adding that "only on "What Do You Want from Me" does Gilmour sound like he cares".<ref name="rollingstone"/>

Despite the poor reviews however, the album was nominated for "Best album by a British artist", in the 1995 [[Brit awards]],<ref>{{Citation | title = The Nominees | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=wgsEAAAAMBAJ | publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' | page = 48 | date = 1995-02-18 | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}</ref> but lost to [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s ''[[Parklife]]''.  In March 1995 the band won a [[Grammy]] for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, for "Marooned".<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2001|p=611}}</ref>

==Tour==
Two days after the album's release, the band's ''[[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell Tour]]'' began at [[Joe Robbie Stadium]], in [[Miami]].  The set list began with 1967's "[[Astronomy Domin<U+00E9>]]", before moving to tracks from 1987's ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', and ''The Division Bell''.  Songs from ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' and ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' featured, as well as ''[[The Wall]]''.  Backing musicians included Sam Brown, Jon Carin, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom, Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, Tim Renwick, and Gary Wallis.  The tour continued in the US through April, May, and mid-June, before moving to [[Canada]], and then returning to the US in July.  As the tour reached [[Europe]] in late July, Waters was invited to join the band, but he declined, and later expressed his annoyance that some Floyd songs were being performed again in large venues.  On the first night of the UK leg of the tour on 12&nbsp;October, a 1,200&nbsp;capacity stand collapsed, but with no serious injuries the performance was rescheduled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=367}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=270<U+2013>280}}</ref>

During the tour an anonymous person named [[Publius Enigma|Publius]] posted a message on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album.  The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights in front of the stage at a performance in [[East Rutherford]] spelled out the words Enigma Publius.  During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage.  Mason later acknowledged that the [[Publius Enigma]] did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band.  As of 2010 the puzzle remains unsolved.<ref name="Blakepp363367">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=363<U+2013>367}}</ref>

The tour ended at [[Earls Court]] on 29&nbsp;October 1994, and was the group's final concert performance until [[Live 8]].  Estimates placed the total number of tickets sold at over 5.3&nbsp;million, and gross income at about $100&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=264}}</ref>  A live album of the tour, named ''[[Pulse (album)|Pulse]]'', and a concert video, also named ''[[Pulse (1995 film)|Pulse]]'', were released in June 1995.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=285}}</ref>

The vinyl version was generally released on a single disc with edited versions of "Poles Apart", "Marooned", "Coming Back to Life", "'A Great Day for Freedom", "Wearing the Inside Out" and "High Hopes".  Russian and South Korean versions are on two discs and do not contain any edits.  Some issues contain the sound of a [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] in the locked groove at the end of each side.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
