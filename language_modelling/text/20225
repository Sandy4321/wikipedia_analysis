'''Dolebury Warren''' (also known as '''Dolebury Camp''') is a {{convert|90.6|ha}} [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) and [[ancient monument]] near the villages of [[Churchill, Somerset|Churchill]] and [[Rowberrow]] in [[North Somerset]], part of [[South West England]]. It is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], who acquired the freehold in 1983, and managed by the [[Avon Wildlife Trust]].

Standing on a [[limestone]] ridge on the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], it was made into a [[hill fort]] during the [[Iron Age]] and was occupied into the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period. The extensive fort covers {{convert|9.1|ha}} with single or double [[Defensive wall|defensive ramparts]] around it. The name Dolebury Warren comes from its use during the medieval or post medieval periods as a rabbit [[warren (domestic)|warren]]. The [[topography]] and [[pedodiversity|differing soil types]] provide a habitat for an unusually wide range of plants, attracting a variety of insects, including several species of butterfly.

==Geology and location==

The site is at the top of a [[Carboniferous Limestone]] ridge on the northern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]]. It forms part of the [[Black Down, Somerset|Black Down]] [[Pericline]] where the limestone has been exposed because of erosion of the overlying [[Triassic]] [[Dolostone|Dolomitic]] [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Banwell to Churchill|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mendips/localities/banwell.html|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>{{sfn|Farrant|2008|p=47}} The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.{{sfn|Atthill|1976|p = 42}}

Dolebury Warren overlooks the villages of [[Churchill, Somerset|Churchill]] and [[Rowberrow]] and provides good visibility across the surrounding lower lying areas as far as the [[Bristol Channel]]. The highest point, at the eastern end of the site is {{convert|183|m}} [[Ordnance datum|OD]], with the hillfort being up to {{convert|50|m}} below this.{{sfn|Bowden|2009|pp=1<U+2013>3}} It is the starting point for the [[Limestone Link]], a {{convert|36|mi|km|0}} [[Long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom|long-distance footpath]] which ends at [[Cold Ashton]] in [[Gloucestershire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Limestone Link (Cotswolds to Mendips)|url=http://www.ldwa.org.uk/ldp/members/show_path.php?path_name=Limestone+Link+%28Cotswolds+to+Mendips%29|publisher=Long Distance Walkers Association|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

== Description ==
The fort covers an area of {{convert|9.1|ha}} and commands views over the surrounding countryside.{{sfn|Dyer|2001|p = 156}} The hill fort is [[Hill fort#Types of hill fort|bivallate]] on three sides and a single [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] on the southern side which is protected by a steep slope.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dolebury Camp Hillfort, Somerset|url=http://digitaldigging.net/dolebury-camp-hill-fort-somerset/|publisher=Digital Digging|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> It is almost rectangular with the longest axis from east to west being {{convert|487|m}} long and {{convert|200|m}} from north to south, surrounded by a rampart which is around {{convert|4|m}} high and {{convert|12|m}} wide.<ref name="nhle" /> It was protected by a [[limestone]] [[defensive wall|rampart]] with a ditch and [[counterscarp]] on all sides but the South. There is an inturned entrance on the West and an annexe of {{convert|0.4|ha}} protecting the easier Eastern approach.<ref>{{cite web | title=Dolebury | work=Roman Britain | url=http://www.roman-britain.org/celtic/dolebury.htm | accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>

==History==

=== Etymology ===
The name Dolebury means ''the idol hill'' from the [[Old English]] ''dwol'' and ''beorg''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=978-1874336037|page=56}}</ref>[[File:Dolebury Camp Somerset Map.jpg|thumb|left|Earthworks at Dolebury Warren]]

===Early===
Hill forts developed in the Late [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and Early [[Iron Age]], roughly the start of the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium&nbsp;BC]].{{sfn|Payne|Corney|Cunliffe|2007|p = 1}} The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of [[iron ore]] were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people.{{sfn|Sharples|1991|pp = 71-72}} Archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] believes that population increase still played a role and has stated "[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/swords/swords-found.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110812090914/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/2008/swords/swords-found.html|archivedate=19 September 2008 |title=Time Team: Swords, skulls and strongholds |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>

Various artefacts have been uncovered representing the long period of occupation of the site at Dolebury Warren.

===Medieval===
In the medieval or post-medieval period, the remains of the hillfort were used as a [[Warren (domestic)|rabbit warren]] which was used to breed rabbits, providing valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent the rabbits from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit.{{sfn|Williamson|2006}} The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hillforthe fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of [[pillow mounds]] and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry.{{sfn|Atthill|1976|p = 92}} [[Ridge and furrow]] agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument No. 1494886|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1494886|website=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for [[lead]], [[ochre]] or [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]].{{sfn|Bowden|2009|p = 17}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument No. 1494887|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1494887|website=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> The site was described by [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] in the 16th century.{{sfn|Bowden|2009|p = 4}} A three story building, believed to be the warreners house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.{{sfn|Bowden|2009|pp = 7<U+2013>11}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Monument No. 1494857|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1494857|website=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>
