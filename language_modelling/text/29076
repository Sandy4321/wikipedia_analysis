'''Sir John Arthur "Jack" Brabham''', [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born [[April 2]] [[1926]]) is an [[Australia]]n former racing driver who was [[Formula One]] champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966. He was a founder of the [[Brabham]] racing team and race car constructor that bore his name.

Brabham was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] flight mechanic and ran a small engineering workshop before he started racing [[midget car racing|midget cars]] in 1948. His successes in midgets and Australian and New Zealand road racing events led to him going to the United Kingdom to further his racing career. There he became part of the [[Cooper Car Company]]'s racing team, building as well as racing cars. He contributed to the design of the mid-engined cars that Cooper introduced to Formula One and the [[Indianapolis 500]], and won the Formula One world championship in [[1959 Formula One season|1959]] and [[1960 Formula One season|1960]]. In 1962 he established his own [[Brabham]] marque with fellow Australian [[Ron Tauranac]], which became the largest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world in the 1960s. In [[1966 Formula One season|1966]] Brabham became the only man to win the Formula One world championship driving one of his own cars.

Brabham retired to Australia after the [[1970 Formula One season]], where he bought a farm and maintained various business interests, which included the [[Judd (engine)|Engine Developments]] racing engine manufacturer and several garages. As of 2008, he is the oldest surviving Formula One world champion.

==Early life==
John Arthur Brabham was born on [[2 April]] [[1926]] in [[Hurstville]], then a commuter town outside [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. Brabham was involved with cars and mechanics from an early age. At the age of 12, he learned to drive the family car and the trucks of his father<U+2019>s grocery business.  Brabham attended technical college, preferring basic metalwork, carpentry and technical drawing.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) pp.20-21</ref>

Brabham<U+2019>s early career continued the engineering theme. At the age of 15 he left school to work, combining a job at a local garage with an evening course in mechanical engineering. Brabham soon branched out into his own business selling motorbikes, which he bought and repaired for sale, using his parents<U+2019> back veranda as his workshop.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) pp.21-22</ref>

Towards the end of the [[Second World War]], the 17-year-old Brabham was called up into the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Although keen on becoming a pilot, he was trained as a flight mechanic, based at [[RAAF Base Williamtown|RAF Williamtown]] where he worked on maintaining [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s until the end of the war.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.23</ref> Upon [[Demobilization|demobilisation]] in 1946 Brabham started a small service, repair and machining business in a workshop built by his uncle on a plot of land behind his grandfather<U+2019>s house.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.26</ref>

==Racing career==
===Australia===
Brabham started racing after an American friend, Johnny Schonberg, persuaded him to watch a [[Midget car racing|midget car]] race. Midget racing was a category for small open-wheel cars racing on dirt ovals. It was popular in Australia, attracting crowds of up to 40,000. Brabham records that he was not taken with the idea of driving, being convinced that the drivers <U+201C>were all lunatics<U+201D> but he agreed to build a car with Schonberg.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.26</ref>

At first Schonberg drove the homemade device, powered by a modified [[JA Prestwich Industries Ltd|JAP]] motorcycle engine built by Brabham in his workshop. In 1948, Schonberg's wife persuaded him to stop racing and on his suggestion Brabham took over. He almost immediately found that he had a knack for the sport, winning on his third night<U+2019>s racing. Brabham has since said that it was <U+201C>terrific driver training. You had to have quick reflexes: in effect you lived&mdash;or possibly died&mdash;on them.<U+201D><ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.33</ref>  Due to the time required to prepare the car, the sport also became his living. Brabham won the 1948 Australian Speedway Championship, the 1949 Australian and South Australian Speedcar championships, and the 1950-1951 Australian championship with the car.<ref>Unique (p.30) Article reproduced from a 1958 edition of ''Australian Motor Sport''.</ref>

After successfully running the midget at some [[hillclimbing]] events in 1951, Brabham became interested in [[road racing]]. He bought and modified a series of racing cars from the [[Cooper Car Company]], a prolific British constructor, and from 1953 concentrated on this form of racing, in which drivers compete on closed tarmac circuits. Supported by his father and by the Redex fuel additive company, Brabham competed in Australia and New Zealand until early 1955. His commercial approach, which included the painting of ''RedeX Special'' on the side of his car, did not go down well with the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] (CAMS), which promptly banned such obvious advertisements. After the 1955 [[New Zealand Grand Prix]], Brabham was persuaded by Dean Delamont, competitions manager of the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in the United Kingdom, to try a season of racing in Europe, then the international centre of road racing.

===Europe===
;Cooper
[[Image:Cooper T51 rear Donington.jpg|left|thumb|287px|A rear-engined T51 of the type Brabham used to win his first world championship.]]On arriving in Europe in early 1955, Brabham based himself in the UK, where he raced his own Cooper in national events. However, as motorsport author Mike Lawrence describes it, he soon "seemed to ''merge'' into Cooper Cars, turning up and turning his hand to anything and doing it well."<ref>Lawrence (1989) p.80</ref> His first drive for the Cooper works team was reportedly the transporter used to take their cars to the track. Brabham built a Cooper ''Bobtail'' mid-engined sportscar at the factory, fitted with a [[Bristol Cars|Bristol]] engine and intended for [[Formula One]], the top category of single seater racing.<ref>Formula One rules did not at that time prevent the use of cars with enclosed wheels.</ref> Brabham made his Grand Prix debut driving the car at the [[1955 British Grand Prix]]. It was underpowered, having an engine capacity half a litre less than the 2.5-litre maximum, and Brabham did not finish the race.

Brabham recollects that he started working at Cooper on a daily basis from the mid point of the 1955 season, although he was not paid. Later in the year Brabham, again driving the Bobtail, tussled with [[Stirling Moss]] in a 2.5-litre [[Maserati 250F]] for third place in a non-championship Formula One race at [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]]. Although Moss finished ahead, Brabham sees the race as a turning point, proving that he could compete at this level.<ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) p.57</ref> As a result he returned the UK the following year, having used the Bobtail to win the 1955 [[Australian Grand Prix]].

Using the proceeds from the sale of the Bobtail, Brabham bought his own 250F in 1956. The 250F was a popular and competitive model, but Brabham campaigned it only briefly and unsuccessfully before abandoning it. Brabham's 1956 season was saved by drives for Cooper in sports cars and [[Formula Two]], the junior category to Formula One, where the mid-engined cars had been having increasing success. Having the motor behind the driver has the advantage that the weight is concentrated on the powered rear wheels for more traction. In 1957, he drove the first mid-engined Cooper-Climax at the [[1957 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]]. He was running third before a component broke. Brabham pushed the car to the line to finish sixth, just outside the points.<ref>In 1957 points were awarded for first to fifth place, with an extra point awarded for [[fastest lap]]. See [[List of Formula One World Championship pointscoring systems]].</ref>

In 1959, Brabham won the World Championship with a [[Coventry Climax]] engined Cooper. Despite their lead in putting the engine behind the driver, the Coopers and their Chief Designer Owen Maddock were resistant to developing their cars. Brabham pushed for further advances, and played a significant role in developing Cooper's highly successful 1960 T53 <U+2018>lowline<U+2019> car.<ref>Lawrence (1999) pp. 18, 22 Brabham had consulted Tauranac by letter on technical matters since arriving in the UK. He used a gear cluster designed by Tauranac for several years and Tauranac also advised on the suspension geometry of the Cooper T53 'lowline' car.</ref> Brabham won the championship again in 1960 driving the T53. 

Brabham took the Championship-winning Cooper to the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] for a test following the 1960 season, then entered the famous [[Indianapolis 500|500-mile race]] in a modified version of the Formula One car in 1961. The "funny" little car from Europe was mocked by the other teams, but it ran as high as third although ultimately finishing ninth. The Indianapolis establishment gradually realized the writing was on the wall as Brabham and his team principal [[John Cooper (car maker)|John Cooper]] had shown that the days of front-engined roadsters were numbered. Ironically, Cooper was not as competitive this year, as the 1.5 litre engine rules were introduced and the famous Shark Nose Ferrari dominated.

Despite his success with Cooper, Brabham was sure he could do better, and in late 1959 he asked his friend [[Ron Tauranac]] to come to the UK and work with him, initially producing upgrade kits for [[Sunbeam Rapier]] and [[Triumph Herald]] road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p. 22-4 Jack had already tried to buy Cooper in association with fellow-driver [[Roy Salvadori]]</ref>

To meet that aim, Brabham and Tauranac set up Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), which initially produced customer racing cars, while Brabham himself continued to race for Cooper. By the [[1961 Formula One season]], the [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] teams had developed the mid-engined approach further than Cooper, where Brabham had a poor season, scoring only four points. Having run his own private Coopers in non-championship events during 1961, Brabham left the company in 1962 to drive for his own team: the Brabham Racing Organisation, using cars built by Motor Racing Developments.<ref name="Law31">Lawrence (1999) p. 31</ref><ref>Brabham, Nye (2004) pp. 14, 145-9 Brabham's and Tauranac's (Lawrence 1999 p. 32) accounts differ on whether the BRO was formed for the purpose of F1, or was already in existence.</ref>A newly introduced engine limit in Formula One of 1500&nbsp;cc did not suit Brabham and he did not win a single race with a 1500&nbsp;cc car.<ref>Cooper, Adam (May 1999) "The world according to Jack" ''Motorsport p. 36'' The article quotes Jack as saying "There's no way you could call those 1500-cc machines Formula One."</ref> His team suffered poor reliability during this period, attributed by some commentators to Brabham's notorious thrift. Referring to Brabham's unwillingness to spend money, his team mate Gurney said that "Jack was [[wiktionary:tight|tight]]er than a bull's ass in fly season".<ref>Henry (1985) p.51 The quote also appears in Lawrence (1999) p.58</ref> During this period, Brabham appeared to be winding down his involvement in driving, with Gurney taking the lead driver role. Brabham stood down for other drivers several times.

In 1966, a new 3-litre formula was created for Formula One. The new engines under development by other suppliers all had at least 12 [[cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] and proved difficult to develop, being heavy and initially unreliable. Brabham took a different approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine: he persuaded Australian engineering company [[Repco]] to develop a new 3-litre eight cylinder engine for him.<ref>Henry (1985) p. 53</ref> Repco had no experience in designing complete engines. Brabham had identified a supply of suitable [[engine block]]s obtained from [[Oldsmobile]]'s [[aluminium]] alloy [[Buick_V8_engine#215|215]] engine and persuaded the company that an engine could be designed around the block, largely using existing components. Brabham and Repco were aware that the engine would not compete in terms of outright power, but felt that a lightweight, reliable engine could achieve good championship results while other teams were still making their new designs reliable.

The combination of the Repco engine and the [[Brabham BT19]] chassis designed by Tauranac worked. At the [[1966 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]] at [[Reims-Gueux]], Jack Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car of his own construction. Only his two former team mates, [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Dan Gurney]], have since matched this achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham in a Brabham-Repco won the championship again and became the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car that carried his own name.
[[Image:2005 Goodwood Festival of Speed F2 Brabham BT18 Honda.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Brabham BT18-Honda of the type with which Jack Brabham dominated [[Formula Two]] in 1966]]
The season also saw the fruition of Brabham's relationship with Japanese engine manufacturer [[Honda]] in Formula Two. After a generally unsuccessful season in 1965, Honda revised their 1-litre engine completely. Brabham won ten of the year's 16 European Formula Two races in his Brabham-Honda. There was no European Formula Two championship that year, but Brabham won the ''Troph<U+00E9>es de France'', a championship consisting of six of the French Formula Two races.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p.221</ref>

In 1967, the Formula One title went to Brabham's teammate [[Denny Hulme]]. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Jack Brabham's desire to try new parts first.<ref>Lawrence (1999) p.92 Hulme, Tauranac and Frank Hallam, Repco-Brabham's chief engineer, all shared this view.</ref>

Brabham raced alongside his team mate [[Jochen Rindt]] during the [[1968 Formula One season|1968 season]]. Partway through the [[1969 Formula One season|1969 season]], Brabham suffered serious injuries to his foot in a testing accident. He returned to racing before the end of the year, but promised his wife that he would retire after the season finished and sold his share of the team to Tauranac.

Finding no top drivers available Brabham decided to race for one more year. He began auspiciously, winning the first race of season, the South African Grand Prix, and then led the third race, the Grand Prix of Monaco until the very last turn of the last lap. Brabham was about to hold off the onrushing [[Jochen Rindt]] (the eventual 1970 F1 champion) when his front wheels locked in a skid on the sharp right turn only yards from the finish and he ended up second. After the 13th and final race of the season, the Mexican Grand Prix, Brabham did retire.  He had tied [[Jackie Stewart]] for fifth in the points standings in the season he drove at the age of 44.  Brabham then made a complete break from racing and returned to Australia.

==Retirement==
[[Image:Brabham Moss BT19 Goodwood Revival 2004.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Brabham continued his involvement in motorsport after his retirement. Here, former rivals Brabham and [[Stirling Moss]] shake hands at the 2004 [[Goodwood Revival]] meeting.]]
In 1976 Brabham competed at [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] in a [[Holden Torana]] with [[Stirling Moss]]. Although the car was crash-damaged on the starting grid, it was repaired, and survives still as a museumpiece to this day.


In 1995 Sir Jack competed again in the James Hardie Sydney 12 hrs endurance race with [[Ross Palmer]] & G.Crick co-driving the No.15 [[Honda NSX]] car and recorded a highly respectable 5th place position which he recorded in pictures on his official website.


In 1998, Sir Jack Brabham returned to Europe and the old [[N<U+00FC>rburgring]] to race a VW [[New Beetle]] 1.8T in the 6 Hours [[VLN]] with [[Ross Palmer]] and [[Melinda Price]], scoring the fastest lap among the 3 drivers with over 134 km/h in average. Brabham said he returned to the Ring for the first time since 1970, and was surprised about the changes in safety - and the sunshine.

==Awards and honours==
In 1966, Brabham was named Australian ''Man of the Year'' and the Queen awarded him an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].<ref>[[London Gazette]]: [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=44005&geotype=London&gpn=6566&type=ArchivedIssuePage&all=&exact=&atleast=&similar= (Supplement) no. 44005, page 6566,] [[3 June]][[1966]]</ref> He was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1978.<ref>[[London Gazette]]: [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/ViewPDF.aspx?pdf=47724&geotype=London&gpn=33&type=ArchivedSupplementPage&all=&exact=&atleast=&similar= (Supplement) no. 47724, page 33,] [[29 December]][[1978]]</ref>

He was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1990.
[[Image:Jack Brabham 80birthday.jpg|right|thumb|230|Jack Brabham at his 80th birthday party]]

Brabham was honoured, along with featured marque [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]], at the 2006 Monterey Historic Automobile Races.<ref>[http://www.jackbrabham.com/news_detail.html?NEWSID=100016 Sir Jack Brabham, O.B.E. - Press Detail<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In January 2008, Brabham was named as an [[Officer of the Order of Australia]] on [[Australia Day]] for services to motorsport.<ref>{{cite web| authorlink =forumula1.net| title = "Brabham Honoured"| url =http://www.forumula1.net/2008/f1/f1-news/brabham-honoured/ }}</ref>


In June 2008, a Brisbane based racing yacht was named in honour of Brabham, titled [[Black Jack]], as Brabham was nicknamed in his heyday. Brabham attended the ceremony and took part in the breaking of the champagne bottle over the hull. 

The yacht recently dominated the Hamilton Island Race Week in Queensland, and is entered in the [[Rolex Sydney to Hobart]] yacht race for 2008.

==Family==

Brabham married Betty in 1951. They had three children together: [[Geoff Brabham|Geoff]], [[Gary Brabham|Gary]] and [[David Brabham|David]] (current [[ALMS]] driver). Despite what Brabham reports as Betty's reluctance for them to be involved in motorsport, all three had careers in the sport. In 1990, David drove for the Brabham team founded by his father. Brabham's grandson, Matthew (son of Geoff), has also embarked on a career in motorsport.<ref name="family">Brabham, Nye (2004) pp.251,253</ref>

The couple divorced in 1994. Brabham married his second wife, Margaret in 1995.<ref name="family" />

==Business==

Before setting up his own race team, Brabham had already  established his own car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, in London. In the early 1960s it also offered engine conversions for [[Triumph Herald]]s and BMC [[MG Midget]] / [[Austin-Healey]] Sprite by transplanting [[Coventry Climax]] FWE engines.

Brabham and Ron Tauranac founded Motor Racing Developments in 1960. The company built the cars the Brabham Racing Organisation used in the Formula One world championship, and was also the biggest manufacturer of customer racing cars in the world for a period in the late 1960s. Although references to Brabham <U+201C>building his own cars<U+201D> are exaggerated (the cars were designed by Tauranac and built by a small team of people), Brabham did machine components and build up chassis. He also contributed ideas to the design process and acted as a very highly rated test driver. Brabham himself was often on hand to help customers with the set up of their cars. The company pulled out of the customer car business soon after Tauranac left in 1972. The Brabham Formula One team won further world championships in 1981 and 1983 under the ownership of [[Bernie Ecclestone]] before going bankrupt in 1992 while owned by the Japanese Middlebridge group.

In 1970, Brabham set up [[Engine Developments Ltd.]] with John Judd; Brabham had employed Judd in 1966 to work at Repco on the V8 engine project. Engine Developments became a respected engine design company. A range of Judd racing engines are used in sportscars today, and Judd engines were used in Formula One and [[Champ Car|Indycar]] (branded as <U+2018>Brabham-Honda<U+2019>) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

Brabham played a small role as a consultant to the [[Simtek]] Formula One team for which his son David drove in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]].

In the early 2000s Brabham was on the board of directors of Jack Brabham Engines, a company investigating a design for six-stroke engines. He resigned the position in 2007.

2008 Brabham is an advisory Board Member of American company Save the World Technologies Inc., which works to develop sustainable technologies.
