'''Luke Michael Smith''' is an [[United States of America|American]] writer. He is currently a staff member at [[Bungie]], a video game development company, and is a former [[Video game journalism|video games journalist]]. Smith wrote for a college newspaper and weekly papers in [[Michigan]] before being hired as one of the first new freelance writers for [[Kotaku]]. At Kotaku, Smith developed his writing style but soon left the site for a staff position as [[1UP.com]]'s news editor. Smith made a name for himself at 1Up, particularly through an article he wrote focusing on problems with the game ''[[Halo 2]]''.

Smith was known for his direct approach to game journalism and scathing criticism of the video game industry. During his time at 1UP the site developed a greater profile and stepped out of its sister publication's shadow, but Smith grew frustrated with the contemporary state of gaming news and what he considered manipulation of journalists and readers into accepting promotional material as news. In April 2007 he left 1UP to become a Bungie writer and co-host of the developer's [[podcast]].

==Early career==
Smith gradually entered into game journalism while working on an English Literature degree at the [[University of Michigan]], writing about media in the college newspaper. After graduation, he worked for weekly papers in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], including ''[[Real Detroit Weekly]].''<ref name="kotaku-feature"/> 

Clive Thompson, a games writer with ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', interacted with Smith over [[AOL Instant Messenger]] and the two began to bounce ideas off of each other for their respective writing projects; when games blog [[Kotaku]] started to expand from one writer (founder Brian Crecente), Thompson recommended Smith. Smith credits his time at Kotaku for helping him come into his own, develop his style and learn about attribution and citing sources, but he left after a short period of time. "At the time stories (on Kotaku) were unsigned. Kotaku was like the Brian Crecente vision. If I posted something or [fellow writer Brian Ashcraft] did people thought [Crecente] did. Also, there was no health insurance, it was just full-time freelance."<ref name="kotaku-feature">{{cite web|author=Crecente, Brian|date=2007-04-30|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/luke.s-orbital-halo/feature-1ups-luke-gets-an-extra-life-256505.php|title=1Up's Luke Gets An Extra Life|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

==1UP.com Journalism==
Smith served as the news editor for [[1UP.com]], the sister site to the now-defunct magazine ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''.<ref name="gamedaily-source">{{cite web|author=Orland, Kyle|date=2007-02-15|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/straight-to-the-source/70064/?biz=1|title=Straight to The Source|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref> During his tenure at 1UP, Smith wrote extensively about the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' video game franchise]], as was considered a leading fan voice;<ref name="gamasutra-shaping"/> in one article, he declared ''Halo'' was the only game series he cared about.<ref>{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|date=2005-08-27|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3143147|title=Broken Halo; Five ways Bungie can fix Halo 2|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke|date=2006-11-06|url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=7597162&publicUserId=5519593|title=Halo is My Mario|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Smith wrote a feature story for 1UP in 2005 called "Broken Halo", in which he explained how developer [[Bungie]] could fix problems he perceived with the game; Crecente said the article put Smith "on the map".<ref name="kotaku-feature"/> Smith also became one of the panelists of the [[1UP Yours]] show, a weekly video games podcast featuring gaming editors and experts. 

''Play.d'' magazine credited Smith with inspiring gamers to learn more about the game industry and not accept company promotion,<ref>{{cite web|author=Arendt, Susan|date=2007-02-28|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/02/luke_smith_inte.html|title=Luke Smith Interview|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> as well as turning 1UP from "the bastard child of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]]''" to an important part of the [[Ziff Davis]] Internet company's gaming network.<ref name="play.d">{{cite journal|author=Dean|year=2007|month=March|title=Luke Smith|journal=Play.d|volume=1|issue=6}}<U+2014>[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] scans available [http://www.destructoid.com/web-mag-play-d-profiles-my-favorite-game-journalist-luke-smith-30159.phtml here].</ref> His style has been described as a "robust, direct approach" to journalism<ref name="gamasutra-shaping">{{cite web|author=Robertson, Andy|date=2007-10-23|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1986/shaping_your_community_what_films_.php?page=2|title=Shaping Your Community: What Films Did, Games Must Do|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2009-02-08|pages=2<U+2013>3}}</ref> and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry.<ref name="play.d"/> Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. "Video game journalism is just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game journalism is still very young, very early, still trying to find out what it is," he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'', Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists "regurgitating" it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information; "We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers," he told Zenke.<ref>{{cite web|author=Zenke, Michael|date=2006-11-14|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_71/409-Game-Journalists-on-Game-Journalism|title=Game Journalists on Game Journalism|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|accessdate=2009-02-09|pages=1<U+2013>4}}</ref> 

While he was becoming more frustrated with the field at 1UP, game developer [[Bungie]] contacted Smith about employment. After sending the company his resume, Smith stopped writing about Bungie and Microsoft to avoid a conflict of interest. Smith accepted a job offer a month later.<ref name="kotaku-feature"/>

In April 2007, Smith announced on a 1UP podcast he was leaving the site to work for Bungie.<ref name="joystiq-poolboy">{{cite web|author=McElroy, Justin|date=2007-04-24|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/04/24/luke-smith-leaves-1up-to-be-master-chiefs-poolboy/|title=Luke Smith leaves 1UP to be Master Chief's poolboy|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> Reaction to Smith's announcement varied; some were happy or sad to see him leave, while others felt he had "sold out."<ref name="kotaku-feature"/> Smith joined the ranks of other former game journalists who left to work for game companies, including 1UP expatriate Che Chou, who joined [[Microsoft Game Studios]], and former [[Gamespot]] chief [[Greg Kasavin]], who became an associate producer for [[Electronic Arts]].<ref name="joystiq-poolboy"/>

Bungie staff hinted in a weekly update that Smith might play a role in the developer's podcast.<ref name="joystiq-poolboy"/><ref>{{cite web|author=McWhertor, Michael|date=2007-04-20|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/luke-smith/luke-smith-leaves-1up-for-bungie-gig-254153.php|title=Luke Smith Leaves 1UP For Bungie Gig|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref> Smith officially began work on May 7, 2007, as content editor,<ref name="kotaku-feature"/> providing fans and the Bungie readership with information about Bungie's game and staff.<ref>{{cite web|author=Smith, Luke; Frank O'Connor|date=2007-05-11|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&cid=12442|title=Bungie Weekly Update 5/11/07|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> Smith believed that there was a special opportunity for game developers, "for someone to come in and tell the stories that people want to know [...] Right now you have four bridges between developer and reader: Developer to PR, to journalist to reader. [This position] could get rid of those middle two bridges."<ref name="kotaku-feature"/> 

While Bungie had historically been good at letting fans interact via forums and provided updates and artwork via their site, [[Bungie.net]], the company's releases had a "corporate and muted tone to it," and made less effort and been less successful historically at providing access to the inner workings of the game studio. As part of a change to become more transparent, Bungie took steps repeated throughout the industry to allow fans more say and recruiting respected voices from the community<U+2014>namely, Smith. Robertson credited Smith's tenure as aiding Bungie's greater focus on, "building, supporting and learning from the ''Halo 3'' community."<ref name="gamasutra-shaping"/> 

Smith also hosted Bungie's podcast show along with co-host Brian Jarrard;<ref>{{cite news|author=Simon, Mallory|date=2008-07-11|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/ptech/07/11/e3.2008/index.html|title=Gamers abuzz with rumors about E3|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> in an interview with his former coworkers at 1UP, Smith said of the Bungie podcast, "we [Bungie] are focusing on getting our listeners and fans familiar with a bunch of the different faces at Bungie studios."
