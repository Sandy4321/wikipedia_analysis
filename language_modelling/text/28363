'''Fudbalski Klub BASK''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+0424><U+041A> <U+0411><U+0410><U+0421><U+041A> , [[English language|English]]: ''Football Club BASK'') is a [[football (soccer)|football]] club from [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. It is one of the oldest clubs in Serbia. The club currently competes in the [[Srpska Liga]] which is Serbia's third division.

==Formation of the Club==
In the Kingdom of Serbia there had been many sports sections and associations, whose members were constantly increasing in number. So in the year of 1891. Belgrade gymnastics association <U+201C>Soko<U+201D> was established. One student, Andra Nikoli<U+0107>, who later got PhD, become chairmen of the parliament, minister of education and foreign affairs, academic and writer (today in part of Belgrade called Senjak, there is a street named after him, Dr Andra Nikoli<U+0107><U+201D>), together with Hugo Buli, was also and initiator of foundation <U+201C>The first Serbian association for games with ball<U+201D>, on 1st of may 1899. This association for games with ball is considered also the first Serbian football club on territory of ex and current Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, this club had been closed very soon and it disappeared. Nevertheless, it succeeded in organizing one real contest on the new football field built in Guberevac. 

Members of Gymnastics association Soko With continued with ball games, and their enthusiasm had not diminished. They have been gathering on one meadow in Jugovi<U+0107>eva Street. The new younger members had constantly joined them, and then started generation replacement. These lovers of ball decided finally to organize again and once more to establish their own club. On member<U+2019>s gathering, after the usual training, under the open sky on their field, they have founded their club. Among others, unavoidable Hugo Buli, Steva Stefanovi<U+0107>, Milan Baji<U+0107>, Ljuba Jovanovi<U+0107>, Mita <U+0110>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>, Mita Stamenkovi<U+0107>, Boba Markovi<U+0107>, Momir Korunovi<U+0107>, M.Milosavljevi<U+0107> and others were present. 

Inaugural meeting was held on [[18 April]] [[1930]], under the clear sky, on unoccupied lot in Bra<U+0107>e Jugovi<U+0107>a Street, where in that time was summer playfield Belgrade<U+2019>s gymnastics association <U+201C>SOKO<U+201D>. 

Assembly<U+2019>s Participants had by acclamation elected Ljubomir Jovanovi<U+0107>, who later became minister in governments of Kingdom of Serbia and president of national assembly, and satisfied with the work done, went home. When had met the following day on the playfield, somebody said: <U+201C>Oh, my God, people, we have founded a club, and nobody had remembered that we should give it a name.<U+201D> Really, in very big exaltation the previous day they have completely forgotten about that <U+201C>detail<U+201D>. 

They have assembled again and then they have started making suggestion. People said that this debate had been very long and at some moments also very bitter, until Ljuba Jovanovi<U+0107>, newly selected president, did not propose the name <U+201C>SOKO<U+201D>. The others have all agreed, so on [[18 April]] [[1903]]. of the old calendar, the first football club in Kingdom of Serbia appeared (FC Ba<U+010D>ka from Subotica was been founded in 1901, two years before <U+201E>SOKO<U+201C>, but on territory of Austro-Hungarian of that time. 

==The early years==
The first and foremost problem of newly founded club was a playfield. The field in Jugovi<U+0107>eva Street was too tight for the playground so another suitable place in Venice bog was found, between current Belgrade fair and railway station. However, they could not stay there because the river Save had risen up, flooded and destroy the playfield. Finally, it was been found adequate playground in part of Top<U+010D>ider and at foot of Ko<U+0161>utnjak<U+2019>s wood, in the place of current Range station Top<U+010D>ider. Although the playground was quite far from the city in that time, <U+201C>SOKO<U+201D> arranged it very well and stayed there for a full 27 years, until the state did not expropriated it for railway needs. 

Some years later, the stadium got and athletics track, the small tribune for standing like these we see today on the stadiums of some smaller clubs. Together with <U+201C>SOKO<U+201D>, this playground entered the history. Apart from many local games, the first international game in Serbia, between national team of Yugoslavia and national team of Romania was played on it, which ended with the victory of our neighbours, with result 2:1. 

It was the third international match of our football national team at all; in the first match, we had been defeated in Olympic Games in Anvers in 1920. by Czechoslovakia 7:0, and in the second match, that was been played on 28. October 1921 in Prague we also lost by the same rival 6:1. The match with Romanian that was played on [[8 May]] [[1922]], in the honour of the wedding of King Alexandar and Romanian Princes Maria, and was observed by over 1.500 spectators, which is remarkable for that time. Yugoslavian team, which was in that time called <U+201C>White Eagles<U+201D>, played in a following line-up: Fridrin, Kujund<U+017E>i<U+0107>, <U+0160>ifer, <U+0160>terka, Dubrav<U+010D>i<U+0107>, Pupec, Babi<U+0107>, Zinaja, Per<U+0161>ka, Vinek, <U+0160>ojat, and the shooter of only one our goal we made, was <U+0160>ifer. On the begin of its work, FC SOKO had faced the problem of playing games, because it was the only one club in this country and it simply could not find any rival. Because of that, the players of the FC SOKO have usually played among themselves. 

It was noted that one of the first and the biggest public games among two teams of FC SOKO had been played on <U+0110>ur<U+0111>evdan, 1904, in the honour of the celebration of centenary of the First Serbian uprising. In that game (the score is not known) following players participated: Stevan Stefanovi<U+0107>, Milan Baji<U+0107>, Vladimir Skobla, Dimitrije <U+0110>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107> Piperski, Dimitrije Stamenkovi<U+0107>, Nikola Spasi<U+0107>, Hugo Buli, Vlada Krsti<U+0107> and other. Six months after the FC SOKO had been founded, Serbian football and engineering pioneer, Danilo Stojanovi<U+0107> <U+2013> uncle Dacha, on [[14 September]] [[1903]], founded the football club <U+201C><U+0160>umadija<U+201D> so the SOKO got the first rival. 

Nevertheless, two years have passed until the match between two oldest clubs in the Kingdom of Serbia took place, mostly because of very bad traffic relations between the two cities. Finally, on [[20 July]] [[1906]], <U+0160>UMADIA and SOKO met in Kragujevac, and the SOKO won by 6:1. In rematch, in 27. August 1906, SOKO won again, but this time more convincingly, with the score <U+2013> 9:0. Unknown chronicle registered that the crown prince himself, <U+0110>or<U+0111>e Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>, was also present. For the history of Serbian football, it is very important that these were the first games between two clubs in this country. This tradition of the rival matches between renewed by FC BASK <U+2013> former SOKO and FC <U+0160>UMADIJA, only in 1993 on the occasion of celebration of 90-anniversary of FC BASK. Since then, every year on <U+0110>ur<U+0111>evdan, on 6th May and on Krstovdan, on 14th September, when they celebrate their holiday <U+02DD>slavas<U+02DD>, this two clubs visit each other and continue friendly games in the green field.  

==Troubling times==
Everything died with the beginning of the [[First World War]]. The footballers replaced the ball with a rifle. In concurrence of events, after Calvary in Albania, very large group of players form SOKO club ended up in Rome, where the government sent them to educate. Very soon, they agreed to renew their club in the foreign country, so they joined Italian FC PRO-ROMA, and as a special section under the name SOKO PRO ROMA, they started playing matches with other Italian clubs. In the half of 1918, as war drew to it<U+2019>s end, SOKO PRO ROMA took part in matches for the cup of the city of Rome, and after SOKO defeated all the rivals, mostly renowned Italian football clubs of the time, they won the first place and the first international trophy for our football sport. The finale was played on [[16 June]] [[1918]], on Piazza Disiena, and after the triumph of SOKO<U+2019>s players, flag of the Kingdom of Serbia flew high on the mast. 

Following players played in our team and reached this succes: Du<U+0161>an Elezovi<U+0107>, Pavle Baji<U+0107>, Brana Veljkovi<U+0107>, Jug Nika<U+0161>inovi<U+0107>, Milo<U+0161> Simovi<U+0107>, Milan Miodragovi<U+0107>, Svetozar Popovi<U+0107>- Kika, Deni<U+0107>, Pavle Luki<U+0107>evi<U+0107> and <U+017D>ivojin Simonovi<U+0107>. (Praise them!)

Hard days of postwar renewal also included the FC SOKO. The club was immediately reesteblished and continued wiht work, but the results of the team were alarmingly bad. At first, matches have been lost with 9:0, 8:0, 9:1, but this did not discourage the management and players. In constant struggle with problems, at the end of the second decade of that century, SOKO was neck to neck with the best Belgrade clubs, BSK and Yugoslavia. In some duels with them, in 1929. SOKO made the first triumphs, successfully played against clubs from Zagreb, Gra<U+0111>anskim, Ha<U+0161>kom, Konkordijom, and in Split, in the same year, it defeated FC Hajduk with the score 2:1. It was the first defeat of FC Hajduk on its own playfield and in front of its own public by one club from Yugoslavia.

For the first World Championship in Montevideo, in 1933, SOKO has three of its players in national selection: Milovan Jak<U+0161>i<U+0107>, goalkeeper, who with great plays in Uruguay deserved the nickname <U+201C>El grande Milovan<U+201D>, doctor Milutin Ivkovi<U+0107>, captain and the best player of the representation, called <U+201C>national brake<U+201D> that played left, and Miroslav Hrnji<U+010D>ek, as a reserve player. 

But then, in the days od SOKO<U+2019>s climax, the members of the same-named gymnastics society, whom it belonged since the founding, and whose name it carried so high and proudly for a long time, did not want SOKO more in their surroundings. The jealousy and envy of some individuals, whose names stayed in the shadow of famous football players, took their revenge. The management and the players of SOKO have accepted this decision placidly, and on the assembly held in 1933, they decided to become independent, and they gave the club a new name - BASK, Belgradian academic sport club. 

Almost simultaneously, the club ran into another, harder misfortune. Belgrade assembly for the necessities of the railway took away from FC BASK the playfield in Top<U+010D>ider, and for some time, and the club literally ended up on the street. Later, the BASK got the playfield behind Belgrade electrical central, which FC RADNI<U+010C>KI got after The Second World War, whose players became the name <U+201C>Masters from the Danube<U+201D>, the name they still have today, even though they are located in New Belgrade <U+2013> but this playfield ceased to exits long time ago. The resolute management and great team nothing could put out of track. BASK had even struggled for permanent place in competition for the Yugoslavian championship, which was played in the begin of 30s using cup system. In the season 1932/33, BASK was also a member of the first league in old Yugoslavia, which had double score system. In competition of 11 teams, BASK took the 5th place behind the champion <U+2013> BSK, second-standing Hajduk, Yugoslavia and Ha<U+0161>k, but in front of Gra<U+0111>anski, Konkordija, Primorje (Rijeka), Slavija (Sarajevo), Slavija (Osijek) and Vojvodina. In the next championship FC BASK was on the 7th place. In the season 1936/37, it was again on the 6th place. Next year it won the 4th place, and that was the highest achievement of this club behind the new champion Ha<U+0161>k, behind BSK and Gra<U+0111>anski, but again in front of Slavija (Sarajevo), Jugoslavija, Hajduk and other. 

The following year, the league was been growed to 12 clubs. The FC BASK was on the 8 place. In the last championship, but before The Second World War, which had been played in two leagues <U+2013> the Serbian and Croatio-Slovenian, with 10 clubs each, final mini league was held with 3 the best clubs from each group. Bask did not get the standing required for the finals. During all this championships, FC BASK had brought out many excellent players. In addition to mentioned Milovan Jak<U+0161>i<U+0107>, dr Milutin Ivkovi<U+0107> and Branislav Hrnji<U+010D>ek, there were also and Miodrag Ranojevi<U+0107>, Stojan Popovi<U+0107>, Miroslav Luki<U+0107>, <U+0110>or<U+0111>e Detlinger, Ferante Kolnago, Aleksandar Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107>, Mladen Sari<U+0107> and others. Among all these names, the name of Aleksandar Toma<U+0161>evi<U+0107> should be especially distinguished, because he was purebred scorer in the third decade, and in that regard also and the biggest rival of the famous Mi<U+0161>a Marjanovi<U+0107>. Uncle Toma<U+0161> left very deep mark in our football as a trainer as well in the period after the war. He was a coach of players in FC PARTIZAN, CRVENA ZVEZDA, HAJDUK, and the founder of the FC RADNI<U+010C>KI (Belgrade) and it representatives <U+2013> Petakovi<U+0107>, Ognjanovi<U+0107>, Ljubenovi<U+0107> and other. He also coached FC SARAJEVO, OLIMPIJA and VARDAR. 

After the Second World War, none of the clubs mentioned in this story existed any more, and all he other clubs that have written the history of our football sport. That sad destiny has also happened to BASK. New football collectives were founded, with new names that were appropriate to that time and circumstances.  

==Recent history== 
In parts of Belgrade, Senjak and Top<U+010D>ider hill, therefore mostly on territory of former FC BASK, club named SENJAK has been founded, and it competed with a lot of success in the best Belgrade league. In this environment was born the idea, that this club could take over the tradition of BASK, that has gathering young people from that part of the city, especially because the FC SENJAK had got the playfield on the edge of Top<U+010D>ider park, very close to former stadium of FC SOKO, where it is today. 

The idea, nevertheless, could have not been realized immediately. No sooner than 1953, on 50-anniversary of SOKO and BASK, on the Annual assembly, in the presence of many members of the pre-war club, FC SENJAK took over the name BASK and all glorious traditions of this oldest football collective in former Kingdom of Serbia. For the first president of renewed club, with votes of assembly participants, famous representative Milovan Jak<U+0161>i<U+0107>, <U+201C>El Grande Milovan<U+201C> was chosen. Since then, until 2005, the FC BASK competes more or less successfully in the biggest Belgrade league. 

In this period, the biggest success had been the winning of Cup of Belgrade liberation in 1958, the victory in the Cup of Yugoslavia in territory of Belgrade football association, and in the same year, the defeat in the final game of Yugoslavia cup for the Serbian territory from the FC BORAC from <U+010C>a<U+010D>ak. In addition, after convincing triumph in the first place with nine points of advantage in the first Belgrade league, in 1971, the FC BASK competed in the Serbian league <U+2013> north group. Today, FC BASK competes in the first Serbian league, whose member it is from 2005, and where it plays very considerable role. 

The management of the club, with whose coming FC BASK became very well organized club, is again on the way to become that, what once was the pillar of Serbian football, whose founder it had been.
